1,Never got it and no reply from vender.,"I have never recieved the item and after several emails to the company, no one has bothered to reply to my emails, I think it is a bogus company and Amazon is fronting for them, Amazon has not helped me either. I have no trust in either. I am in the process of legal action and or criminal actions against both.My review 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 across the board"
5,Amazing!,"I know this has been said millions of times and i don't mean to sound repetitious, but. . . . .TOWNSEND IS GOD! This album is unlike anything I've heard. It's basically a mixture of Ocean Machine and SYL and it works! It's what Jesus Christ Superstar would sound like if it was done by a metal musician. Infinity, like Devin's past works, has many, many cheesy bits thrown in. Unfortunately, at times, the songs are plagued by poor production and the songs ""soul Driven"", ""war"", and ""Dynamics"" have melodrama that I can easily do with out. But, alas, if you're a devy-worshipper, i suggest checking this out."
5,Great.,"This is a very well made and very diverse for Townsend. The songs are very well crafted, well sung, and the lyrics are well written. Excellent album."
4,Questions Answered. Never Bored.,"In here were answers to my questions and things I never thought of asking. Newcomer's Handbook is a pretty powerful tool for those thinking of moving here. A few sections need updating so I gave it a four. I've lived in San Francisco just about a year now and also find two other books very handy for getting around. One is called Backroads and the other Golden Gate Trailblazer. After spending my whole life in New England, this move has proven to be a fantastic eye opener."
4,Paradox comes to the west,"Seemingly, like all Zen books, there are paradoxes in the writing. For example ""For about twenty years I thought I was greatly benefited by Buddhism, but in the last twenty years I have been ungaining everything I learned. To gain nothing is always the conclusion of Buddhism"". There were some rough lectures for my ""beginner mind"" but there are some real gems, particularly when imparting stories of the Buddha or monks.Sokei-an was one of the first Zen Masters to come to American, and some of the most fascinating lectures are those contrasting Buddhism and Christianity, such as the Triune Body of Buddha and the Christian Trinity. Even more striking is the lecture ""The religion of North America"" where he contrasts Tao and Christianity, wisdom and love."
3,Classic Priest,"This is one of the group's only 80s efforts to come close to matching their 70s period. Some of the tracks are still played in the live concert set list t oday, while about the rest of the other half of the album is filler. I would recommend it, it is a cool album."
5,Simply The BEST!!!!!,"This has to be the best metal album of all time. When you think heavy metal, you think Screaming For Vengance. It is amazing that a band could come up with something this great. But if you think about it, it's Priest. Buy it now, if you have it, buy it again.."
5,Awesome.,"This is a great album, no doubt about it. Great riffs n solos, plenty of hooks. Not a single filler track here.As great as this album is, I can't understand why people say that after it, Priest went downhill. That's simply not true. Defenders Of The Faith is just as good as this album if not better, so is Painkiller...and Ram It Down has plenty of great songs to offer as well.I'd recommend this to anyone into ACDC all the way to some of the newer metal bands such as Children Of Bodom (who owe a lot to the likes of Priest).Best track? My favorite is probably Fever."
4,AMAZING,"The only reason I don't give it five-stars is due to the horrible song ""PAIN AND PLEASURE"", on of the worst ever written by Judas. The rest is perfection in metal."
4,SHEER JUDAS !,"JUDAS is a great band. Like so many others, after a determined recording, it seems their creativity was gone forever, the momentum was lost. THis album is the last Priest album to show real first-class material. The only flaw is that, being a band totally led by Halford, Tipton and Downing, Ian Hill's bass is very hard to listen and Dave HOlland's drumming is very weak."
1,"Great Judas priest album, Horrible overcompressed remaster sound quality (buy the 1990 CD release)","This is a great Judas Priest record, but the sound quality of the remaster is too loud and overcompressed. The rerelease is a victim of the loudness war. Look for the 1990 CD release. The quality is much better on the original CD release (more dynamics)"
5,A Heavy Metal founder,"This must be one of the... top three? Heavy Metal albums in history: an equivalent in power, speed and feeling to Iron Maiden's ""Powerslave"". A record that can make you push a little too hard on the gas of your ridiculously old Mustang. A must-have, and a must-know-lyrics-in-order-to-shout-them-through-the-window.Now, it's true that, as for almost any of these remasters from the 70's or 80's, overall volume of the recording is slightly low. Also, the two or three newly added songs are actually unnecessary: at least for me, the listening experience for a record this integral and important feels interrupted by the adding of any ""live take"" of a song that you already listened 30 minutes ago in it's proper order.But maybe this is just me. So I give it the whole 5 stars."
1,Horrible Remaster - Heavy Metal That Sounds Like Tin Foil,"Don't waste your cash on this terrible remaster. This is the last remastered album / disc i will buy. Everything is mastered so compressed with the thinking the everyone listens to music on mp3 players, well that is NOT the case! There are still people who care what the music actually sounds like. This is just another thin glassy sounding remaster that sounds terrible on a real stereo or a high quality car stereo. Very, very disappointing!!! This Is Supposed To Be HEAVY Metal & It Sounds Like Tin Foil."
1,"Come on, everybody! Let's fork out more money!","Don't get me wrong. I'm a JP fan and love this record along with most of their other records. The reason for the 1 star is that I, along with many others, already own the entire JP catalog. Now they re-release them with 1 or 2 bonus tracks. What do they expect me to do, buy the whole catalog again? What they should have done is release all the bonus tracks on one cd. Then I'd buy it. But since they're just trying to get me to buy everything again, I'll just download the unreleased songs from the internet. This re-release of Screaming... is only worth it if you don't already own it."
5,EPIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I was at this concert and it was epic then and it's epic now. A must have for any Priest or Metal fan.
1,EXCELLENT Album - HORRIBLE sound quality for these MP3s,"How disappointing! Love this album, but the mastering / mix is TERRIBLE! Flat, loud, terrible! I hope to find a higher quality version."
4,An Essential Metal Album?,"I had no thoughts to buy this album until I find it on a list in which it was ranked as one of the essential metal albums of all time. That list was quite good but I cannot understand why they chose this one. This one is a great album but the albums like ""Sad Wings of Destiny"" and ""Stained Class"" are true classics. You could say that many Priest fans were happy while listening to this in 1982. It was a great improvement from ""Point of Entry"" which was a big disappointment for many Priest fans. I am not saying that this is a bad album at all. There's many great songs, such as ""(Take These) Chains"" and the title track. But still...there's two songs I don't like so much: ""Fever"" and ""Pain And Pleasure"".Stars: Screaming for Vengeance, (Take These) Chains, You've Got Another Thing Comin'"
5,"SCREAMING, SCREAMING FOR VENGEANCE!","Another hard-whacker from Priest! Now, we all know that Judas Priest are the Metal Gods, and are one of the best bands out there. But on this they are THE best band out there. Sheer, sheer heaviness is exhibited on this album. Everything fits perfectly. Rob's vocal talents lay perfectly on top of KK and Glenn's guitars. Also, the bass and drums are some of the best in rock, let alone metal history. Like somebody wrote on a list, Electric Eye is probably the album's standout track. With that guitar intro, how could you go wrong? This is definitely one of the most essential albums to be released ever."
4,an under-rated classic,"I've been listening to this album since I was 8 years old.I'm 28 now and,unlike me,it hasn't aged one bit!Priest had some great stuff before this,but nobody could've seen this beauty coming.It is a true metal masterpiece,covering all moods with a heavy metal feel.Closed-minded people will miss out on a truly brillant effort by one of metal's godfathers!Unfortunately,Judas Priest has been going down hill ever since.But,there's only one way to go after releasing an album like this."
4,screaming for vengeance,"Screaming for vengeance is a Priest classic and is one of their best.The sound on this remastered edition is not as good as the previous version of this album released in 1990 on cd.This edition is worth it""s price only for the superb dvd which contains live classics performed at various US Festivals.Recommended."
5,Fantástico! Maravilhoso!,"Considero o CD Screaming for Vengeance o melhor álbum do Judas Priest, a performance no US Festival '83 aconteceu no auge da banda, logo após ao famoso show do ""Screaming"". Por fim, a regio do DVD rodou no Brasil sem problemas. Super recomendo!! Baita show!! K.K. Downing e companhia mostrando porqu so sensacionais."
5,30th anniversary screaming for vengeance,Must have for all judas priest fans & METAL FANS!!! Dvd 1983 US concert is great!!! The screaming for vengeance cd sounds better than ever
5,THE BEST!!!,"Just in case you have been locked away since Hendrix walked the planet, Judas Priest is without any doubt the greatest Metal band of all time. This album merely continues to ascert itself as another chapter of excellence from the Metal Gods. I am so glad Rob is coming back to Priest as I always thought it was a bad idea to replace him with a singer from a cover Priest band, as that isn't the way it should have been done. This band with Rob has given me some of the best moments of my life, I will always be grateful for the majestic ""Power of the Priest""!!!! Buy this album, as you will never regret it!!"
4,Protected! Detected! Electric eye!,"Screaming for Vengeance is probably the band's best '80s c.d. All the guitar solos, especially ""Electric Eye"" and ""Fever"", just burn! I have a concert video for this tour, and it's simply amazing! If you're into Priest, there is no excuse for not having this c.d. But I will warn you about two things. First, the production is horrible, and second, Dave Holland is on drums."
4,Great Album! A Metalhead Must!,"This is one of those albums that every metalhead must have in their collection. It has so many fine points. ""Metal God"" Rob Halford screams out those lyrics like no one else could. The instrumental portion is also quite good. There is no denying that Priest has talent.The songs on here are all good. The only problem I have is that ""You've Got Another Thing Coming"" is often noted as their best. I find it is quite overrated and is my least favourite track on the album. Songs like ""Electric Eye"" ""Bloodstone"" and ""Devils Child"" are what define the NWOBHM genre and are all instant classics.This isn't the best British Heavy Metal album out there, and falls short to a lot of Maiden's albums, but it is a Metal classic that every Metalhead should weclome into their collection with open ears."
5,right before Judas Priest jumped the shark...,"...there was this very good, tight record that caught a band at the height of their musical powers, with songs that flowed as effortlessly as the duelling guitar licks of KK Downing and Glenn Tipton. ""Screaming For Vengeance"" simply got it right as the perfect summertime metal record.Two things about this record really stand out for me - the airiness of the production that you feel you can walk right into, and the showcasing of many voice styles & ranges Rob Halford is masterfully capable of. Sheer brilliance, never since duplicated."
1,Have to send it back,The DVD would not play in my laptop or any DVD player in my house. Looks like the disc was never finalized.
2,Over-Rated !!!!!!!!!!!,"I know alot of people love this album, and think it's priest's best album,but I think this record is over rated.THey were a more influential band before they released the Point of Entry album.Everything after British Steel in my opinion is second rate material.Not to say that I dont like some of the records released after British Steel,but they were not the influential band they were before the ""Point of Entry"" debocle.They tryed to reclame their Metal sound on this Record but they half-assed it.it's just way to poppy.I love the title track,the song ""Electric Eye"" and ""Riding on the Wind"" but I think the rest of the album is prety weak.I think the hit single off this album ""you got another thing comin"" is a louzy song."
3,Worth getting for fans; others go to a library,"Vampire Slayers is one of two things, depending on the reader: an absolute, must-have for the fan of vampires and particularly vampire-hunters; or, for the less-than-pleased with Van Helsing, a curious and eclectic selection of occult stories. Those who don't like horror at all will probably be bored (many of the stories involve similar settings: vampires take over the world), but fans will be entertained, as the stories stretch over many writers and styles."
3,Very good serial--among Republic's best,"Republic made the best serials particularly from 1939 to 1943 (their goden age) and this serial is one of their best. A bravura performance from Eduardo Cianelli, breakneck action, a rousing music score and top direction from William Witney and John English make this a winner all the way. It's too bad another superb serial from the same year--Drums of Fu Manchu--is not available on commercial video. Rated solely against other serials I give it 4 stars."
4,Saturday morning TV.,"After years of a distinct memory of a serial seen only once, I finally located the title and was able to purchase it. I had a vision of the ""Copperhead"" leaping onto a moving car from a hill and low and behold it was a ""still"" on the box. While the acting was less than stellar and the story line full of holes, it still made ""Flash Gordon"" even more cheesy. It was a hoot to watch how two different endings to each cliff hanger were filmed. One for the end of the episode and a slightly different one for the beginning of the next. All in all it was fun and worth the hunt to find it again. Once I located the title, I have to agree with others who praised "" The Mysterious Doctor Satan"" as one of the best of a genre which was on it's way out."
2,This guide for party and pleasure seekers only,"I was disappointed with this book. It was more interested in where to drink and where to find the gay/lesbian scene in Germany than many of the unique historical sites of the country. If you are looking for a guidebook that helps you find cultural / historical treasures in Germany, this is not the book."
4,These little eco friendly green bags...,"...are a perfect choice for me. I am an extreme when it comes to saving our planet earth. There are a total of 30 bags, so if you pay 2.99 like I did, then it comes out to about .10 a bag.Now these bags came from Linens N Things (the sticker is on the package) and the retail price of the bags are 4.99 not 24.95, so if you think that you may find them elsewhere at a better price, I think that would be best. I did not purchase the shark power scooper, I only intended to use this with my pet pooper scooper patrol (also on Amazon) to scoop and dispose into the scooper bags."
3,bags are adequate,The replacement bags are adequate. The electric device? not so much. But at least I got some bags out of the deal.
4,Great Nightlight,I got this as a gift and I really love it. It's easy to use and casts a lot of light. Our bedroom is painted a dark red and even there the colors show up pretty well. On a white wall it does much better.I haven't had it long enough to know how long it will last but it seems to be constructed well enough from what I've seen so far.
3,It's YOU!!! and other creatures,"Eyetoy play is the first eye toy game for the PlayStation 2. For a first game bundled with an eyetoy it has to showcase the capabilities of the eyetoy right?Storyline: I haven't come across an overall story, just the small stories in the mini-games N/AGraphics: It's YOU!!! and other creatures, the graphics that are on the disc look as good as 3D PlayStation graphics are even if it isn't the main part of the games experience 7/10Sound: The music and background noises are good but get really repetitive 5/10Gameplay: The game has you moving around doing mini games from whacking ninja's to hitting records there is alot to do in the game. The controls work for the most part, but if you go outside the camera's view (which can be easy when your jumping around) you will have to get back quickly to control your character.The video recorder where you can record yourself doing anything up to sixty seconds, but It could have been much more. 7/10"
4,Fun for the family,"I primarily picked up this game (and the sequel) for my kids (daughter mainly) who aren't quite old enough to work with the controllers much, although (my daughter) actually knows what to do with a couple DS games. Anyway, they have tremendous fun seeing themselves, flailing about, and getting the satisfaction of controlling the game.Only gripe is this thing needs lots of light."
5,"Excellent, Primo, all that ...","The oud is a special instrument for me, so maybe I'm biased, but I think this is one of the coolest albums ever. The two ouds weave a tight swirling structure on top of some great samples and percussion. Just traditional enough, virtuosity on all tracks, crackin' beats, and smartly danceable. A bit o' Devil's Anvil, but what Devil's Anvil just touched on, is here in force, and 100 times better. If you love the oud and love a smart rave beat, you'll love this, and if you don't know the oud, here is your chance to fall in love with the fretless lute that to millions of people is the soul of Middle Eastern music. A bit like Fretless bass in a higher register, a bit like the sequencer of the Egyptians, the oud is the missing link to the musics of our common ancient civilizations. If you can sit still while this CD plays, you should ask your vegetable tender to be wrapped up, boxed and entombed."
2,qualified ok,"The producer of these videos uses real couples most of which are porn actors because they are more comfortable having sex on camera. You don't know how much is real and how much is acting. You still get the feeling you are watching porn; which was a big negative for me. There was not a lot of instruction just mostly people having sex which made be suspicious that this was just another way to introduce someone to porn. I wish it had more of a scientific, instructional, universtiy study approach."
4,Cute shoe,"Cuter in person! Runs a little smaller than usual shoe size, but they're leather, so I'm confident they'll stretch out a bit."
4,"Not Great, but Ok","This seems to be a rewrite of Ms Mason's Pirate, which is a much better book. I found myself skipping ahead in places and rushing through others. The story is ok and if I hadn't read Pirate so recently I may not have noticed. Others may enjoy this book very much. The rest of Ms Mason's books have been wonderful."
2,A little hard to plough thorugh,"The book by Ford Johnson is OK, but it is a little laborious to try and plough through. The writing style the book uses is full of rationals and logic, and if you like that sort of thing it is great, but really... The American philosophical writers such as Thoreau and Emerson cover more ground and do it better.There's nothing really that I would call ""new"" here.Ford's curious way of using words seems more related to his Harvard Law school background and I found it hard to get into his writing style. Not a criticism, that's his personal style, but it did not whet my appetite with the content, nor did it tickle me much in the way of style or substanceAnd why not print as softbound? ... is a lot of money to spend for a throw away book."
5,Thizz or Die!!!!!,"The Fendi Boyz deliver a Bay Area classic with Money Movement. Not only do they got great lyrics & beats, but they also have some of the best from the Bay on this album! They got Keak Da Sneak, Mac Mall, Guce, Mistah F.A.B., Kuzzo Fly, Johnny Ca$h [R.I.P.], The Jacka, Rydah J. Klyde, BavGate & Lil Real 1. If you listen to Bay Area music pick this up, don't sleep on it."
3,NICE SONGS FOR KIDS BUT TITLE IS MISLEADING,"I recently ordered this book/CD combo. Good news first. The nice part about this product is the fact that you get 19 kids songs in English, which is quite a good value for the price that one pays. Now the bad news. Problem is that there is really no real teaching of English vocabulary anywhere. Although letters of the alphabet and numbers are recited in English (and this part only lasts a few seconds), nowhere on the book or on the CD can one find recited or written English on organized subjects such as animals, colors, basic pronouns (I, you, he, she) etc. (Well to be fair one dog and one cat are each mentioned once in the book). But no such thing as ""This is a dog"" or ""This is a mouse"" or This is a frog"" kind of list is available. So, summing up, if you want a nice collection of English children songs, you may want to try this. However, if you want to teach your child basic English words and vocabulary, go somewhere else."
1,no max comfort here,Got this seat to replace schwinn stock seat. I think the stock seat was more comfortable! Dont waste your money! Im still searching for a comfortable alternative.
2,Big and not comfortable,I should've listen to those comments below me. It's very big and it's kind of hard
1,misleading,Bought this seat thinking the so called shock absorbers actually worked. Don't waste your money.
3,Elementary programming book -- overpriced,"I was compelled to buy this book for a course that I have to take at a community college to allow me admission to courses that I want to take. Amazon.com describes the book as having over 400 pages. It does not. It has a little over 300 pages, it is paperback, and it costs over $70! If you have absolutely no concept of, or experience with programming, then this book will give you a firm foundation, but at too high a price. Otherwise, skip it."
3,Not a bad grill,"I've had this grill for over a year. It certainly has a number of features I appreciate like the tool hangers, a decent side burner, a nice shelf extender, fairly accurate temp gauge, a propane level indicator, etc. I even bought the stainless grates and use those rather than the ceramic ones that came with it.As to performance, this is where I get fickle. For direct heat cooking I find it has a hot spot on the right rear side. Things there will burn while in other other areas of the grill are barely done. I can avoid this when I indirectly cook, but it's a bit of a pain.In short, its a good grill for the price, but it's no Viking or Napolean. Then again, it doesn't cost what they do."
2,"Would have liked a more scientific, and less personal slant.","The Natural History Of Blood book was well written, although I thought the personal references were a big distraction. Overall, it seems more like a self-centered personal chronicle as compared to a scientific and historical discussion. Minus the personal stuff it could have been a good read."
2,bones better than blood,I enjoyed the first book about Grey's Anatomy but the book about Blood ( Five Quarts ) was not as interesting .
4,16 in. wine glass racks,"I was in process of building a wine cabinet and needed glass racks. These seemed to be just what I was looking for. They arrived in quick time. Some of the packages were open and screws were missing from most of them, but was no big deal as the screws that came with them were too long for 1/2 inch boards. Racks are nice and shiny and look good. Most had a slight warp and are not perfectly level, but was able to use them. My personal biggest problem is that they are 16 and 1/4 inches long, not 16 inches as described. Since I was already constructing my cabinet, I now had to back paddle and redesign my whole plans on cabinet. A pain in the butt, but finally worked out a solution and completed cabinet. The frustration factor is why I only give 4 stars. Otherwise the racks are OK as long as you know they are a 1/4 inch longer than advertised."
4,Items (4) almost as described,"I received these four wine racks and installed them myself. The only problem was that one package, though sealed, did not have any screws which are necessary to install.They work well and do what I wanted them to do!"
2,No Hardware,"It didn't come with any screws. Disappointed since it says that there are screws included. Overall, I think i will like it once I find some screws to put it up."
3,Nice Idea,This did not come with screws and the screws it came with were not suitable for hard plaster. That was a minor annoyance but the product good and gets glasses out of the way. The price is less than going to the Container Store. Stainless Steel is Stainless Steel and Screws are fairly easy to come by.
3,Functional but missing screws,I ordered two of these stemware holders and only one included a set of screws. Easy enough to find screws to work but that effort shouldn't have to be made at all.
3,Not bad,"I ordered these twice (from 3rd party sellers but Fullfiled by Amazon in both cases). First order was sold by W and P trading corporation. What I got was crap, clearly seconds or production rejects. All crooked with visible welding spots. Crappy packaging (just a plastic bag without any labels/info).The 2nd order with items sold by Onesource International was much better! No dirty welds, decent packaging (bags with cardboard labels with information). They are still bit crooked but acceptable. Also some of the screws were mismatched (different sizes), but I ended up using my own hardware."
3,From Chile,"Bueno, en realidad el contenido del cd no es tan bueno como esperaba. Lo compré para engrosar mi colección de rarezas de Iron Maiden. En todo caso, el cd estaba nuevo, impecable."
1,LISTEN TO SAMPLES BEFORE PURCHASING,"First, before you even think about buying this album, LISTEN TO THE SAMPLES!! I cannot emphasize it enough.This does not sound much of anything like Iron Maiden at all, and don't get me wrong, I love the use of unconventional instruments in tribute albums, such as The Piano Tribute To Iron Maiden, or the orchestral versions of the songs ""Dance Of Death"" and ""Blood Brothers"" found as the b-sides to the Wildest Dreams and Rainmaker singles.If you're still not convinced, as to why I hate this, I'll explain:It's not the instruments, nor the vocals, it's the slaughter of the songs themselves, they don't sound anything like the songs themselves, the riffs are completely different, and even The Trooper could be easily mistaken for something else.This album is a scam, probably created under the assumption it would sell because Iron Maiden fans are typically hardcore collector fanatics.DON'T GET THIS ALBUM!!"
1,HORRIBLE!!!!!!!,"I can't see Iron Maiden giving someone permission to totally butcher their songs like this. This is disgusting. The style doesn't fit, but the worse part is, they didn't even try to make it sound good. It sounds like something that was they threw together in one day to make money."
2,The Walrus Still Is Paul,"This project has nearly nonstop drumbox, preventing it from working as a soundscape (viz. ""Your Favorite London Sounds"" by Peter Cusack) but it has too many interruptions by voice tapes to be a good bass&drums album either. That leaves it in an uncomfortable middle ground, neither music nor sound effects, but just enough of both to ruin the other. The ring-modulated swept-filter is WAY overused, too.This is only groundbreaking and innovative if you're not familiar with the real stuff."
2,DEFINATELY not for everyone who is a McCartney/Beatles fan,"This is not one of Paul's pop/rock albums. If you like experimental sound recordings (ie. ""Revolution 9""), you might like this piece. If you don't like them, this is probably not for you. I, personally, don't care too much for it. Everyone is entitled to his or her own opinion and you might think it's great."
5,for fabs fans,"It was so nice to hear the sound clips of the Fabs on this CD.Along w/ the sounds of Liverpool: windstorms,rain,traffic,fish 'n' chips hawkers...we had John,Paul,George and Ringo chatting about broken guitar strings,etc. The CD really is a gift and a gem.All Beatles fans need to buy it now.Really much better than I expected.Macca is god's gift. I would love to share a ""jazz ciggie"" with him."
4,"Oh yeah, he IS a genius","THIS IS PAUL. Experimental music at its finest. From the man who helped bring you Rubber Soul and Sgt. Pepper. The Walrus who turned John on to Stockhausen and.....oh yeah, was one of four guys who changed Western Culture.I don't know WHO that guy in Wings was."
1,If you want noise Listen to the Subway,"Now let me begin by saying that I love the Beatles always have and always will. Through the years there was only one song that I can say that was annoying and that was #9. Paul's latest falls in there with that one, why would any one want to buy this is beyond me. Only a Fool on the Hill would buy this."
2,The quieter side of Guns and Roses,This is the original guns n roses. It's cool to see where a classic band got their ideas from an ancient band. slow music. not for gnr fans.
4,"Elisabeth, Billy Budd","Melville's short novel, Billy Budd, relates the late eighteenth century story of a naive, innocent, young sailor, who is hated by John Claggart, the ship's master-at-arms. Good versus evil, the individual versus society, absolute law versus mercy are all themes in the novel. Billy Budd contains many Christian allusions, and some commentators have suggested the novel is a Christian allegory that depicts the sacrifice of an innocent man. The narrator repeatedly draws comparisons between Billy Budd and Christ and Claggart and Satan. Although the reader must be willing to wade through many unfamiliar allusions and difficult vocabulary, the novel has a simple, but gripping plot line with universal themes."
2,"Hot , Hot ,Hot","I went to bed with a patch on my knee. I woke up in the middle of the night burning. Man, the pain from the sore knee was gone but it had been replaced with a burn that I cannot describe except to say it was hot,hot,hot. Do not recommend."
5,Great!,It's a fun CD. Wonderful surprise for Little Einstein fans. I bought it for my son's birthday and he absolutely loves it.
4,The Kids LOVED it!,The kids both loved this CD. It has the little einsteins talking to them as well as the songs. The only warning I have is if you leave it in the car you might hear it TOO much -from an adults point of view that is!
3,Too much dialogue,"Fairly entertaining (at least for my son), Musical Missions certainly is a nice package. There are colorform 'stickers' that are placed in the special booklet, which has different scenes that correspond to the stories. My complaint is there is too much talking among the Little Einstien characters and not enough singing. There is actually more dialogue than song. Without the booklet and stickers in hand, listening can be frustating for a child. I was hoping the 'Kite Parade' song was included, since it is my son's favorite, but it's not here. I agree with the other reviewer, that if a music only cd was available, I'd prefer it over this.I certianly don't mean to rain on anyone's parade, if your child likes Little Einstiens, they will like this CD. Just wish it was more music and less talk."
2,disappointed,"My twins are Einstein fanatics and I thought it would be great to have a Cd of some of the songs from the show. The CD is basically a few of the shows on CD, not much for songs, just the episodes."
3,Lots of talking,"I bought this for my 4 yo son thinking it would be songs of the little einsteins shows. It has some songs, but like other reviews ( which I should of read) it has lots of talking from the episodes. It keeps him somewhat occupied, but would of been better if it has just been the song versions. Hope they come out with a second version with just songs alone. I would buy that in a heartbeat."
3,Loud,My daughter only plays with it for about 3 minutes at a time and its LOUD no volume control its pretty cute but not really worth the money maybe she'll enjoy it after she plays with all the other toys she got for christmas.
4,Cute,"This is a cute toy and makes fun noises for little princesses. My 3 year old has lots of other princess toys that she plays with a lot more, but every once in a while her or her brother will get it out and ""abracadabra"" everything. It seems to be durable and I don't think that the volume is too loud. I really like that it has an on/off button also."
3,Too Loud!,"The sound on this wand is way TOO LOUD, and there's no volume control. It becomes very annoying to listen to."
5,And now you can be a magical princess too,How cute is this. This was bought for my daughter who is 2. She loves it. She waves it around and grants us all our wish...Its really cute and my 6 year old loves to dress up and play with it too.
4,Daughter loves it,"I was skeptical but she really loves it! She uses it every time she plays ""princess"", which is several times a day! She's not at all gentle with it so I'm pleased with it's durability."
5,Great for Princess Fans!,We replaced a junky karaoke machine with this other Disney Princesses toy and were very pleased. My daughter loves it and it has survived many accidental crashes to the tile floor already. The audio quality is surprisingly good as well.
2,Not worth the price,"I found this book to be more a family history or family tree lsiting of the author than anything. The ""ghost stories"" are only a tiny fraction of the book.It is more family tree than anything..really not worth the price asked for a basically homemade book.I love reading about Carnton Plantation but the stories here are more suitable for children than adults and are the type of generic story that are included in most ghost story books.Had there been a review of this book I would not have purchased it."
2,Very disappointing,"The book was well-written, but repetitive. The same city sites came up in almost every chapter. The restaurants reviewed were mostly tourist traps. The food was decent, but overpriced. Do not go out of your way to visit the Varsity. While the food was inexpensive, it was sub-par. We did not drive, but used the MARTA system. The sites were often no where NEAR the MARTA stop listed in the guide book. More emphasis needs to be placed on the fact that downtown Atlanta is dangerous after dark, and there is not much to do in the evenings (once the few attractions close)."
3,Information on Atlanta,"This book is very informative, but is not quite what I expected. I was looking for something a little more colorful with some pictures and not 100% text. Also, the text is very small, making it very difficult to read.The information is very valuable and helpful when planning a trip."
4,Capital of the New South,"These guide books by Frommer are always well researched and this one is no exception. Atlanta is covered from top to bottem and the book does a commendable job of getting the feel for this sophisicated city. Most of the top sites in Atlanta are in a relatively small area and this book covers them thoroughly. If you are going to visit Atlanta for the first time or have not been to the city in a while then I highly recommend this book to you, there is much to see and this book will let you get the party started right."
2,what's up with this?!?!,"I picked up this CD single without ever hearing it. I thought ""Oooohh 1998 remixes"". What a waste of time that was. These remixes are pale compared to the original. They have no ""ooomphh"" to them. They just kind of chug along... Do yourself a favour, and stick to the original.."
5,Nice. Very Nice.,"I'm no audio expert, but these are the best headphones I've ever owned, and I've been through a couple of pairs in this general price range. I've found these to be very helpful in my noisy office enviroment. They produce sound so clear and eliminate outside noise so well, that I'll occasionally slip them off for a second, just to make sure they're not loud enough to disturb my officemates (which they never are).Strongly recommended."
4,"Incredible sound, even better price!","I'm an audio enthusiast. Highly critical of the sounds I listen to and through the headphones delivering the highs, mids, and lows. These are very good headphones. Not the best but perform solidly. Nice isolation of removing the outside noise... but really warm low ends (deeper bass response) and nice mid and high end frequency responses. I have heard many headphones... Sony MDR-V500's, MDR-V700's, and MDR-V600's. These offer a suitable replacement without the high cost. These headphones could easily double for DJ use or reference listening purposes. They are well constructed and most of all comfortable. The single wire conncetion to the left side makes them even more less likely to tangle and are reinforced to make sure they last a long life. Lifetime warranty included. Hmmmmmm. We'll see. Initial impression? Very surprised by the cery good sound and affordable pricing."
4,I must be too old...,"... but these were much louder than the headphones these replaced. I use them on my PC, at work, and needed to turn the volume down. Also, the bass is quite strong, which I think is a good thing, although I put the speakers half-off my ears until I got used to it. On the strong plus side, the cord is nice and long (and I'm now the envy of the office because of it; I can reach both of my computers without losing the headphones). And the pads are quite comfortable (and should last longer than those foam thingys that wore out on my last set of 'phones).All told, they're a good deal, and should last me a while."
2,So So headphones,For the money they aren't to bad. Just mediocre. I would pay an extra $10 and get the Sony headphones.
3,Appearance Not so Grand BUT IMPRESSIVE Sound,When I first opened my box I was a bit dissapointed at the looks of my recently bought headphones so I went through and checked the return policy as I carefully opened up the packaging so that it might be returned in proper condition. But when I tried on the headphones to listen to a few mp3s of my iMac I was quite impressed at the sound it provided. I've now been listening to them for over an hour and a half so I've decided to turn in this review. The power behind these headphones is great enough to play extremely loudly without distortion of spund due to the bass. The ear rests are very comfortable (allowing hours of easy listening). These also come with an adapter for larger headphone sockets if your system requires that. I'm keeping this until they're worn. enjoy!
4,Great Sound For the Price,I use these to monitor playback during recording sessions. They sound fine and are lightweight and comfortable. Three more words.
2,Flimsy and disposable,"Wish I would have bought a different pair, as now I'm back on here searching for replacements.The sound of these is decent, but you'll find the cushions fall apart quickly and the pair will end up in a landfill after little use.Do yourself a favor and buy something more durable."
2,Subpar Quality,I bought these after the right speaker on my sony mdr-cd180's which sold for a similar price went out and was not impressed by the sound quality at all. The bass seems rather weak and the audio for music just sounds really off. I tried messing with an equalizer to try and get a better sound out of it but no matter what I tried it just didn't sound right especially when compared my other headphones. These headphones were comfortable but were almost too big for me as well and I consider my head to be an average size. I'm not sure what other headphones I'd recommend as I've not found anything that sounds as nice as the sony mdr-180's for a similar price but I certainly wouldn't recommend these.
5,Koss UR-20 Headphones,"Recieved The headphones in 3 days. Quality of the headphones are fairly good, Sound quality was really good for the price.All in all I'm please with my purchase. For the the price it's hard beat."
2,Good and Bad,"These headphones are great quality and has great bass and sound. The bad part about these headphones are that they are ridiculously huge. You can't really wear these in public because they just look really huge and also if you use these to listen to music, other people can easily hear what your listening to. Its like a mini speaker, you cant use these in a library or school or anything because they are too loud."
3,"Good sound, brittle frame","I enjoy the sound quality of the R80 unit. However, I have two complaints. 1) the ear cushions wear out too fast and 2) the frame is made entirely of plastic and breaks where the ear piece and headband join. I have sent two pair to Koss for warranty repair in 18 months. The warranty repair cost is $6 plus shipping (about $5). Good thing Koss offers a lifetime warranty. I do not abuse the unit so there is an obvious design weakness in the frame. The R80 has been in production for several years so I wish Koss would modify the frame to improve durability. I guess you need to spend more money to get a steel frame. Because of problem number two I cannot recommend these headphones. The next time they break I am tossing them in the trash. My $35 headphones have now cost me $57 due to repair and shipping cost."
3,"incredible sound performance, bad producing quality","I once have KOSS R100. It is light, comfortable and provideboth strong bass and crisp mid-frequency response. HOWEVER,you got to be careful when you put on and off it from yourhead because it has a fragile plastic connection at earpadsand headband. Mine is broken already at both sides. :("
4,Good solid product,"I ordered these as a replacement and am pleased with. This headset provides solid performance, especially given the price. Fair amount of noise isolation, good sound quality and comfortable. While not a ""life changing experience"" I do not think I could do better without spending significantly more."
2,"Great sound, frame sucks","I enjoy the sound quality of the Koss R80 very much. I listen to CDs and DVDs on my computer and the headphones plug right into the computer jack. There is no line distortion. However, the frames are made of plastic and both of the sets I owned broke just over the ear piece. I noticed that a couple of other reviews have mentioned the same problem with breakage. Koss has a great product with respect to sound reproduction, but I cannot recommend them due to the problems with the plastic frame. Yes, there is a lifetime warranty, but the shipping costs each way make using the warranty unprofitable."
2,Not for people with big heads!,"I've owned a pair of R-80 headphones for about 3 months, and I used them everyday at work, taking them on and off at least a dozen times a day.I enjoyed these headphones up until the day the earpieces snapped off when I put them on my head. The R-80s have a pair of plastic pins that hold the headband to the earpieces together and they snapped. That said, my head is on the large side and my hat size is 7 3/4 inches (US) or 62 cm. According to Berkely Hat Co. this is a XXL hat size."
2,Not very comfortable,Good sound - not comfortable at all... The ears are not very soft and hang heavily on the tops of the ears rather than resting just over the ears.
3,Sounds good but it is made of cheap plastic that breaks often,"I think this is a very good sounding and comfortable headphone. It is light, and you can wear them for hours without feeling pinched.However, it is made out of cheap hard plastic. The first pair broke after a year, and its replacement just broke again. So on average each pair lasted for about a year. Both time, the plastic pieces broke and the headphone practically flew apart.Good thing is Koss offers lifetime warranty, $6 for each repair. The downside is shipping it back to them is not cheap, and you will be headphoneless for 2-3 weeks. I think I will use the cheapest US mail to ship it back this time.I will use my PRO4AA while the R80 is in the shop. The PRO4AA is heavier, but also much more durable, the parts are all aluminum. Unfortunately, it does not sound as good and it pinches my ears quite a bit for long duration listening."
3,"Not Too Bad, Not Too Good","I got this item for a price that would have been a little over the top for a GOOD pair of headphones. The sound quality was good, and you can always expect that from a Koss quality headphone, but the only downside to this is that the durability is not too great. Mine started breaking after only 3 and a half months. However, i would highly recommend that everyone should buy the Koss TD - 61 because it is one of the greatest headphones that i have come across. Yes, it is on amazon and you can go to the headphone section and click on Average Customer Rating. What surprizes me is that it was actually less expensive than the Koss TD - 10, and it only has much better quality and durability. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone who would take it for jogging or running, but what can i say, it is a STEREOPHONE. In conclusion, do not buy this product if you want the best in quality (there are better headphones and prices out there!)."
2,Breakage bad....,"Having suffered through a wide variety of garbagey headphones in my time, I was very pleased with the quality of sound to be found in these. Unfourtunately, my hapiness was short lived, as 3 months following my purchase, the plastic housing for the swiveling earpiece just snapped off...Never one to be discouraged, I repaired it with a small metal rod bent as a ""splint"" for the broken piece, and attached to the housing with electrical tape...much to my chagrin, the otherside broke 2 weeks later...in exactly the same way! well, I did the same ghetto style fix for the other side that I had for the first, and theyre still usable, although barely presentable... this is not a reliable product is the long and the short of it...."
4,good quality for good price,"i'm a student at carleton college and am constantly studying. i am one of the people who like to listen to music while studying and wanted a nice pair of headphones for my cd player when i went to the library or wherever i would go to do work. i knew i wanted a pair of koss headphones because they consistently provide great quality and back all the products with a lifetime guarentee (try finding that anywhere else). so i bought the R10's; they looked pretty stylish and the price was very reasonable. i am very satisfied with my purchase. the headphones are very comfortable and very durable. the sound is quite good and they are designed to block outside noise. i'll be honest, i have friends who have better headphones but they paid much more for them. you will get your money's worth with these bad boys."
4,Koss R80 Headphones,"I'll start off by saying that this is the most expensive pair of headphones i have purchased so i'm not an audiophile by definition. Im not a seasoned reviewer either so i'll just list the pros and conspros: covers entire ear and does a good job muting out peripheral noise, produces very good sound (i use it for cdplayer, laptop, guitar amplifier), cord is detachable and tangle-free (i broke my last two headphones by ripping the cord also, the tangle-free cord is connected to only one side for ease of use), comfortable (i have a fairly big head and it fits perfectly and securely)cons: i dont recommend it for very long uses. headphones like this one that cover your entire ear promotes sweating and heat. i just take off my headphones for a few seconds to let my ears breathe and put them on again.as you can see, the pros easily outweigh the only con. enjoy."
5,... Headphones,"These head phones are the best!! Wicked nice bass and sound. The things shack when I crank it!! It says they are for home stereo, but im using it with my portable Mini Disc player. They are unbelevably light!! I recomend these for anyone looking for a good pair of headphones."
3,"Decent sound, flimsy construction","The plastic track on which the earpieces ride broke within a month of my purchase. The sound quality is decent for the price, but the construction could really use some work. Koss offered to replace it under the warranty without giving me any trouble, but it's not worth paying the shipping charges both ways plus the $7 warranty repair fee."
2,Muddy sounding headphones,The lack of detail is annoying with these headphones ..an example would be while listening to an acoustic jazz album it's almost impossible to differentiate the cymbals from the rest of the instruments ..
3,Just OK for the price,"Pros: Decent if unexceptional sound; reasonable isolation from outside noiseCons: Very cheaply built; cups don't slide easily on crossbar; not terribly comfortable if, like me, you have a larger head; cups don't swivel enough for single ear listening"
3,Good quality but very it's very large,"It's good, not as good as my other senheiser ones, but for the price it's really good, it compares with headphones that cost 2-3 times more, if the size does not matter. well isolated from outside world sound."
1,"Terrible frame quality, would never recommend","Sound quality was amazing for the price...build quality, not so much. A month after using the head phones, the right side earphone snapped off from the plastic head band when putting them on my head, 2 months later, the other side, and today, yet again, in another place, rendering the headphones useless as they will not stay on my head anymore. I had contacted Koss directly about getting replacements because they were defective, and they said they would charge me a 15 dollar repair fee and I would have to pay to have them shipped to the repair facility. Total cost would be around the same price as I paid for the headphones. Ill never recommend koss headphones ever again."
2,I totally agree,"These sound good, but the stupid plastic things break, the cord came with a short (so the sound always went in and out), and the headpiece wouldn't adjust nearly small enough for a woman with a normal-sized head (me). I bought Sennheiser this time, and I hope they work out."
3,I returned them,"You may get luckier then me. I had to return them because the sound was not true. Something must have been wrong in the wiring. I couldn't recognize Placido Domingo's or other artists' voice. I ultimately bought and use the JVC's.The ratings said so many people liked these. I had KOSS before so I bought these. They have the one wire lead which is the feature I look for. As I said, I may have just gotten a pair that slipped by quality control! A lot of people like them."
3,"Good, but there are much better headphones in this price range.","I must say, these headphones are definitely unique. The drivers are huge, and so are the headphones themselves. These are insanely comfortable, lightweight, and easy to use.Audio quality is the major problem here. These sound very sub-par compared to other headphones in this price range. I would not recommend these whatsoever.If you are looking for headphones in this price range, I would go for the Monoprice 8323. Best headphones you can get under $50."
4,Satisfaction at a good price!,"Headphones work quite well mainly midrange instruments to medium-high, for basses as specified are not appropriate, yet have good clean and clarity sound and most attractive is all this a pretty good price, also showing good design, comfortable and good isolation to the outside. Overall I would recommend it, it is a good buy!"
3,Too D*mn BIG!!! :(,"The earcups and headband are too danged BIG! There's no way to adjust or tighten the thing to clamp them into a tight seal around your ears. That's not to say that they're not adjustable -- only that the smallest available adjustment isn't small enough! God help you if -- like me -- you've got a small head!AND, now that the sealed plastic package has been opened, it will be QUITE unreturnable. Eighteen bux wasted! Ick! :( Caveat Emptor!All that having been said, I must say that like all Koss stereophones, the sound is truly excellent. Just make sure you have a large enough head to fit it!!!"
5,Koss headphones are worth thir price,"For the price I paid, this pair of headphones is holding up very well. My last pair of headphones to go were also made by Koss and those lasted for four years. I have one small problem with this pair however that I did not have with my last pair, which is the lack of a volume control on the cord. Other than that small flaw which van easily be compensated for, this product has earned its reputation for being long lasting, durable and affordable."
4,Very Very Very comfortable. but stuffy sounding,"I am an audio professional. For location work I wanted some practically disposal headphones because I knew they would get destroyed. Why pay a lot for headphones that will hit the ground several times a day?They look weak but mine have not broken yet.I have never had phones that I can wear all day without hurting my head or ears. these are VERY COMFORTABLE.I mostly just listen to dialog through them and that works out fine. For music the best way I can describe the sound is 'very stuffy'. As if there is no space or air to the music.But hey, for $15 I'll buy a few back up pairs"
3,Okay. Not spectacular.,"I suppose you shouldn't expect ""spectacular"" sound at this price. The headphones are well made and comfortable. All in all, worth the money. I'm satisfied."
2,"Average sound, quality construction","The reason why i bought this product is because of the reviews, I am actually disappointed by the sound quality. I should have bought again Senn HD 202 (mine did not survive for year). After using it for about 2 weeks, I got used to the average sound it delivers. The one thing I like about is headphone is its construction, it doest feel cheap compared to Senn HD 202."
4,Koss UR-20 headphones,"These are very comfortable headphones. I don't notice any ear fatigue at all. They are tuned for a little extra bass which some may not like, but this is one of the reasons I chose Koss. Essentially they always have the ""loud"" turned on. I don't turn the volume up very loud, but I still want to feel the kick drum and bass guitar when playing music.Additionally, the other frequencies are still heard. Voices are easily heard. For $15 these are excellent headphones. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is that the cord maintains the shape it was in from the box too long. It doesn't forget that it was folded and that is easily forgiven considering the price paid. They are big but I listen to these at home when the kids are asleep and I don't want to wake them."
5,Great Sound...,"I trusted the Koss name that these would sound decent, but was surprised they sound as good, and are as comfortable as they are. I have a much more expensive set of a different brand and these sound comparable, and are definitely more comfortable. (These were a Christmas gift for my mom... she's very happy with them, too.)"
4,Very Nice,Very good product for the price. Very comfortable with good sound quality.My husband uses them for playing and listening to hard rock as well as sometimes on his PS2.
3,Good sound but leather disintegrates in a year,"I've had these headphones for about a year or more. They sound pretty clear, with no distortions. There's very little bass though adequate for the price. I'd say the sound quality is comparable to the stock iPhone headphones. The extensible cord allows you to move around a bit while wearing them next to the PC.The only issue I've found is the quality of the ""leather"" foam cushions. After about 6-8 months the plastic leatherette material started disintegrating and leaving black pieces of plastic on my ears when I use them. After about a year almost all the plastic is gone and the foam is starting to disintegrate also."
5,good headphones,"I tried several other headphones, looking for a pair I can use with my very noisy treadmill. These work pretty good. They would be even better if they fit tighter to my head. I may have a smaller head (woman). If I hold them against my ears with my hands I can block out more of the treadmill noise. Instead, I use a second headphone set and put them on over the KOSS phones. The sound is plenty good enough for me. Using for TV while on the treadmill."
4,Quality.,"I'm not a big audiophile, but these headphones do what I want. They're:1. Comfortable, even for long periods.2. Durable.3. Come with a lifetime warranty.4. Block some outside noise, but you can still hear some of it.The cable is 8' long, but it's really not a problem.I don't really know how to judge the sound quality, because I have nothing to reference to at all. It sounds good enough to me. All in all, if you're looking for a pair of sturdy comfortable headphones that block out most outside noise but still let you be aware of whats going on, get these."
2,Not for big headed people,"I can't recommend these headphones for two reasons:they are too small for my very large head, if they make head phones big enough for my big head these are not them. The band on top presses down on the top of my head and starts to hurt after 10 or so minutes.the volume is really soft and far away at lower-medium volumes. unless you are listening pretty loud these headphones sound strangely muffled and subdued. there's just something off about the sound, something I never noticed in headphones before. It may be that I'm not used to headphones this good and my ears are just adjusting, but I doubt it. If you can somehow try these out before you buy them that would be best. I imagine they'd be comfortable for someone like my dad with a normal sized head."
5,Awesome,"These blow my comparable Sony headphones out of the water. They're very comfortable and they aren't too heavy. They come with an extra male connector for compatability. I have to put them at the maximum height/width but it works. The band that goes over the head is flexible and feels like Nylon. The noise cancelling is decent but could be better. Overall, they're a steal at this price and I will recommend them"
3,"Headphones Too Big for Female, Koss R-80","I wanted a reasonably priced pair of closed headphones, and bought the Koss R-80 based on many of the positive reviews found here. When I received them, they seemed like nice sturdy pair, and had great sound quality. Unfortunately, the top headband does not adjust enough to accommodate a ""smaller"" head. I'm not a particular small person- of average build for a female- but these phones were massive, and did not seal around my ears."
3,Not the same,"I got a pair of these when I was about 14 years old. They lasted for about 12 years before one of the earpieces started going out. They held up great and sounded great. I bought a new pair this year and I guess its gone through a slight redesign. They still sound great but they are much lighter, feel cheaper, the adjustment doesn't slide with ease, and the new model no longer twists and folds together for travel purposes."
4,Great headphones for the price,"these produce a pretty good sounds, considering the price. I love the long cord. I use these for when I practice on my digital piano, and listening to music in my room. They get uncomfortable after wearing them for a long time, especially when I wear my glasses, they start to push the glasses onto my ears which causes pain. They are pretty comfortable though. They seem to be made to last, and have lasted a few accidental drops on the floor."
3,They Sound Good But Feel A Bit Uncomfortable,"I will never again purchase a large pair of headphones online. I think that not having the opportunity to try them on and test their comfort was a mistake. These headphones produce a clear and fully produced sound, but I found it difficult to wear them for more than an hour. The material that the headphone shell is made of produces an annoying sound when I change the positioning of my head. The annoyance is bothersome and reminds me of fingernails scratching on a chalk board. I do not highly recommend purchasing this product."
2,Great Sound too bad they're defective.,"I recently purchased a pair of the Koss R80 and all I can say is they have a very nice clean sound and despite what people have said about build quality they seamed decently built for a pair of $34 dollar head phones. The problem is the cord was defective on both pairs I ordered (I had to replace the first pair), the right channel would cut in and out. I wish I could say that all the negative review it gets are unwarranted but I can't. I would avoid the Koss R-line of head phones and look else where."
3,The average R-80,"First I'd like to say that these were my second headphone purchase and I'm a bit disappointed(first was Numark HF125). I've used the r-80 with a CD player, an ipod, and then hooked both up to an amplifier. The difference in quality was noticeable with an amp or even a mixer, probably by 25%. What I've noticed was that the bass wasn't as clean or deep sounding as the cheaper Numark. The Numark did not rattle or distort with the volume at 75% high whereas the Koss R-80 was just the opposite. The vocals were decent though. This is probably better for watching TV or movies.The build feels a bit cheap, but it doesn't break. Outside noise doesn't get fully blocked out but then again, its not an in-ear monitor.What I loved about these headphones were its long telephone-like cord that doesn't tangle. It felt pretty comfy on my head, but i still did feel a bit of pressure after wearing it for more than an hour(I've got a large head), but not to the point where it hurts or annoys me too much."
3,Superb Bass Response,"Nice headphones for the money. Superb bass response and clean sound free of interferrence from outside noise.The 8-foot cord is awkward because it is coiled and constantly tugs on the earcups. After more than 15 minutes of wear, cups tend to go sweaty inside. It would help to have an uncoiled cord as an option."
3,Good for the price,"These headphones are extremely comfortable and look pretty good (the look more than the price you pay) but sound quality is only so-so. They don't do a very good job of blocking external noises, and music coming through doesn't seem to sound any better than a ... set of earphones I have. However, they do the job well enough and are comfortable (which is important to me), so I would say they're worth the relatively low price."
3,Caution Advised,I'm more than a little disturbed that the UR-20 and R-80 Koss headphones appear to link to the same 90 reviews...
1,More Of The Same...,"This book is another attempt to convert Jews into Christians without their knowledge. There is nothing wrong with missionaries when they are honest about their beliefs and goals, but trying to convince Jews that they will be more Jewish by believing in Jesus is about as dishonest as it gets. Jews for Jesus in name alone is an oxymoron (like ""Kosher pork""). Honesty is the best policy. This book does not portray true Judaism OR true Christianity, and does a disservice to true believers of both faiths."
1,Horrified,"This book implys that there is something terribly wrong with being a Jew (all us Jews will be going to a Christian hell, and so forth). It is utterly one sided and down right insulting. A total waste of a read if you are truly interested in either Judaism or Christianity."
4,Great Collection,This CD has all the classic rock songs that everyone loves. It's a great way to get them all together.
1,unhappy snoozer,"I bought two sets of these pillowcases and have opened one so far. They are soft to the touch, as mentioned in other reviews, but become extremely wrinkled with use, and after laundering are mishapen and wrinkled. I should have returned them. I guess the 2nd set will be for decorative display on the bed top only!"
3,Good Buy,"At the price, these pillowcases are an excellent buy. They aresoft to the touch. They really do need some touch up with aniron to make them look presentable."
4,Regal 200tc Cotton Pillowcases Brick Red,Fabulous quality and vivid color. Laundered nicely and ample room for my pillow.
2,Not useful for K-12 education,"The Shape of the WorldThis video was purchased as a supplemental activity for middle school World Geography. Way to long and boring to be useful for even high schoolers. I expected Patrick Stewart to bring some interest to the subject, but too much time is spent on interesting to me, but BORING to anyone else details. I should have remembered that PBS shows should always have their boring factor examined.In summary, way too much money on a video I did not have the opportunity to screen before buying. If you are out for some adult entertainment (not that kind!!!!) for a week of long winter's nights, go for it, but it has little utility for teaching geography and culture."
4,keep this book for reference,I was introduced to this book during a Systems Analysis and Design class as part of a Master's Degree program. I was impressed with its thoroughness. Anyone serious about learning and maintaining about SDLC and techniques in systems analysis and design should keep this book.
2,"I love the idea, but plastic window falls out.",I bought about 4 of these for me and friends/family. I thought it was a great idea to have a 2 cup measuring cup that was level to the top. The problem is that it didn't take long for the window to pop out. This happened without abuse on all of them.
1,This CD is included free with VisualAge for Java 4.0,Do not buy this CD if you have VisualAge for Java 4.0. It is included for free with 4.0. It is the exact same CD - no new examples. The 3 examples shown are pretty decent for a free CD...
2,NOT GOOD,I have to format every other disk and half the time it does not work. The disk are from the 1990's and are not what are shown in the picture.
1,It's been said before by better directors and writers,"The 'what if'/'if only I had known' genre is not served by this badly-written, badly-directed 92 minutes of my life that I will never get back.Catherine O'Hara and Joey Pants are splendid as always, but there are too many characters given equal importance, leading to a choppy and unresolved story.For the best of the genre, check out 'Memento' and 'American Beauty' instead."
5,good things come in small packages,"""Witch On The Go"" has changed the way I do magic. Cal Garrison opened my eyes to the fact that all the time we spend doing rituals may not even be necessary. Her philosophy that ""Magic is everywhere, all the time, wherever you are"" has helped me a lot. Those of you who think that sacred space can only be created inside a circle of salt will discover that it's all around you because it comes from you! The spells in this book are well written and they are definitely portable! Read it for your self. ""Witch On The Go"" is one of the best magic books out there. Ms. Garrison has done it again!"
3,Cute,"I actually thought this book would be different. I did read it through but unfortunately became a bit bored.I had thought the spells would be more something someone could do anyplace, anywhere. But you are told from the start to have a little portable altar (she gives instructions for this) that you keep with you.A lot of the spells require finding a private place.In the beginning she does offer a spell requiring only a rubber band so you can 'stretch time' when you're late. This I found helpful.If you can find this book in the library by all means look through it. But I wouldn't spend the money if I hadn't already.Thank you.MEF"
5,Love this set,Needed a replacement bowl for my set. Happy I could find it on Amazon for a good price!! Love the Noritake Colorwave line. It's casual yet very nice for entertaining too!
3,"Bowls great, packing horrible","Love the bowls. Shipping packaging was the pits. Out of six bowls, three were damaged, one broken completely the other two chipped.. Ordered the same bowls directly from Noritake. They came fine."
2,"Excellent watch, terrible PC interface","The features on this watch are fantastic. It is an excellent heart rate monitor, compass, alitmeter, and barometer. However the serial PC link is terrible and stops working frequently. I have had my X6HR for one month and it no longer connects to the PC (the main reason I bought this watch in the first place). For some reason, Suunto still uses a serial connection, claiming on their website that this is the latest technology (more like the cheapest). If you plan to use this watch for its PC data transfer function, be very cautious and keep an eye on the warranty. Also the Suunto Activity Manager software is terrible and crashes frequently. I haven't lost any data (yet) but its very annoying."
3,"Great features, but needs serious polish.","The X6HR has a great range of functions. However, the user interface and reliability of the product need serious work before its steep pricetag can be justified.- Bezel buttons give no positive feedback, so you need to look closely at the screen to confirm button presses.- The HRM function seems both unreliable. Heart rate occasionally drops out or spikes to double for no reason. I've parallel tested with a $30 HRM, which seems more reliable.- The compass function is unbelievably poorly designed. Instead of drawing a compass on the face, or indicating N/S/E/W points around the bezel, the watch tells you the number of degrees you are facing, or prints N, NW, W, SE, etc on the screen. This is a completely counterintuitive way of displaying the information.- The PC connection software looks like it was written in the 1990s- provides little functionality and poor usability.This watch had great promise... but it has proven very disappointing in design."
3,nice hiking companion,"This is a nice hiking companion but it is not a training tool. You do not have any information regarding calorie or TE after the exercise. For training go to T6, T4 or T3. For hiking with PC cabality this is a good option. The Polar S625 can do a better work for hiking with additional trainign capabilities."
4,SCI FI survival skills,"Dave Grossman has done a fantastic job of combining SCI FI and the true warrior way. There are so many great learning points that it ought to be required reading at the Police Academy. The story its self was so interesting that I had a hard time putting it down. What a novel idea and a excellent twist to war and SCI FI. Keep up the great work Dave, WAHOO"
4,Militaristic fiction,"Highly entertaining book based on a novel type of spaced travel. The military and law enforcement communities will appreciate numerous references to some of the top trainers and training methodologies in that field. But the authors seem much more authoritarian-leaning than the libertarian Robert Heinlein, who seemed to have been (somewhat) an source of inspiration for the authors."
3,A unique interpretation,However just because something has what could be termed as a unique interpretation doesn't mean that is good. Its not that I have a problem with the concept of a different mode of travel to other planets its just that in trying to be interesting the book managed to alienate at least one reader. By having the mode of transportation be basically sailing ships the book reads less like a fantasy epic and more like something by C.S. Forester.Overall-Basically this is the Horatio Hornblower saga with elves and other magical creatures not badly written just not what I was expecting. As a novel of sailing ships the book has merit on some level however there is not much about the book that I would construe as either a work of fantasy or science fiction.
1,Self-impressed and Under-par,"Unlike almost everyone else here, I am totally under-impressed with this book. The premise of two-space is interesting, although I have to stretch to suspend disbelief enough to get into the storyline. I was willing to do that, but I just cannot overlook the constant author intrusions and cliches in this book.Did Baen even bother to have editors take a look at this? I can't even get past page 43. This one is going to the second-hand store. Not worth buying unless you're a fan and are willing to put up with all the prancing and posturing."
4,Need a summertime diversion?,"If you are relaxing this summer and would like a good book to read, then this is the one! Guns, guts, glory, and poetry (?) in the far reaches of the galaxy. Grossman and Frankowski have blended science fiction and warrior combat into a 362 page trip into a future time with current ramifications. Most people in the military or law enforcement will enjoy this book and should be intrigued enough to check out other books by the authors, especially, Dave Grossman's ""On Killing"" (an texbook truely NEEDED by every law enforcement officer on duty).Keep 'em coming, gents."
4,Now I'm a New Sci-fi Fan,"""The Two-Space War""...What a great book! I've never been asci-fi fan, so initially I was a little skeptical about getting into this, but Leo Frankowski has converted me. And Dave Grossman depicts what it is like to have the combat mindset of a ""true warrior."" He renders an illustration of how all cops and front-line military personnel experience the same thoughts and fears which drive them into heroic feats...the same mental and emotional toughness which has existed from the beginning of time and will continue to the futuristic end of time. A must read for law enforcement and military."
4,Pricey,Lot of money for what it is but works. Item was shipped fast and packaged good and included instructions. would have given it a five had it not been for the price.
1,Never received it,"We never received the o-ring kit which was ordered prior to a home project requiring the kit to fix my nailer. Then weeks later, on Friday I get an email saying that I had been refunded because I had returned the item!This was the worst attempt at an online purchase I have ever made. I have bought through Amazon before without a problem, but this caused serious disappointment and made my project much harder than it had to be."
1,Disorganized and not suitable for learning microelectronics,"Jaeger includes an incredible amount of material in this book, but he fails to organize it in a meaningful manner. Most of the sections of the book were disjoint and never related to each other, which confuses the beginning engineer."
2,Difficult book to understand,"It could possibly be my personal intelligence level, but this was a very difficult book for me to understand. It was required for my Electronics I class, so I didn't have much of a choice. Luckily I saved some money on this book by buying it used on here, so that made me feel a bit better about me not understanding the book. Not one I would personally recommend, but if you don't have a choice, go for it."
2,Came off first time through car wash,Came off first time through car wash. I prepared the area properly and installed the mirrors. they were on for about 4 weeks
3,Works. Dont like blue,Works great for dealing with the side view mirror blind spot. Now I can see at a glance what before took me a 1/4 head turn to see if there was a car on my side. I dont like the blue. Im going to buy another that is standard clear mirror. Havent had it on long enough to see if it comes off as other reviewer experienced.
3,Not True Dettol Soap,This soap is good but it is not true Dettol soap. Its a copy of the Dettol soap and is made in India.
5,Great Info for Future Baja Residents!,"Having resided in Mexico over the years, I whole heartedly endorse Roberta's book for authentically describing life south of the border. Not only does she accurately explain the logistics of functioning once across the border, she fills each chapter with stories that only a long term resident would recognize as uniquely Mexican/gringo experiences.My Mexican brother-in-law and I (100% gringo) laughed so much as we read the stories during a recent road trip that it triggered memories of our families' hilarious adventures in Mexico over the last 15 years. Pack your bags! Baja4You is a real primer to take life easier in a land where you can rediscover the joy of living without sacrificing the proximity of U.S. interstates and metropolitan services.Don't miss this inspiring and very helpful travel guide."
3,"Soulful CD from ""Breaking Glass"" star","OK, so maybe this CD is not ""Breaking Glass"". ""Breaking Glass"" was such a phenomenal album that I don't know if Hazel O'Connor could repeat it. I first heard of her in 1987, seven years after, apparently, she was a star in England, so I don't really know what happened, but I surmise that she was unable to repeat the power of ""Breaking Glass"" and so her stardom faded. But let's get back to this CD. If you like ""Breaking Glass"" you're sure to like this album too. Hazel is older, maybe less angry (she's not threatening to kick anyone in the ass on this one), maybe more religious and introspective (talks to God about helping her get rid of her prejudice; in another song, says that a friend she has not seen for a while reminds her of Shirley MacLaine). I'm giving this CD three stars with the recommendation that you give it a listen; I may rate it even higher with time."
3,Correction of mistake,"Just want to correct a mistake I made in my review. I consulted the lyric sheet, and in the song ""Rebecca"", Hazel's friend has passed away; she has not merely not seen her for a while. Apologies to Hazel."
5,Very interesting,Anyone who has some interest in the development of aviation will find this book very informative. It goes into the personalities of the people who were involved it developing this fantastic airplane. The interweaving of these personalities is very interesting. I recommend it as a great read.
3,BOOGALOO,"O.K, Nazareth are a bunch of old farts but it doesn't stop them being one of the best bands in the world. Although Boogaloo only has four good songs it's still worth having. Just listen to 'When The Lights Come Down' and you will feel the awesomeness of Dan McCafferty's vocals electrifying your mind."
2,Sure cure for insomnia,"Nice cast, but the stories are something like 75 minutes of sheer boredom which suddenly try to turn into a thriller in the last 15 minutes or so. My wife and I could develop zero regard for the characters."
2,Same Old Song & Dance,"Thankfully, the CD includes an update of ""How Deep It Goes"" and ""Hello Moonglow"", where we get a little over a minute of those incredible Wilson harmonies and sweet guitar. ""Make Me"" is ""okay"", the acoustic guitar intro is great. Perfect Goodbye is catchy, but not amazing. Ann's voice sounds pitchy and tinny on many of her vocals, and Nancy sounds like she's three years old at times, vocally. Go back to the range in Nada One, Nance, will ya? Heart will always be lagging behind, I'm afraid. The good news is, they've accrued a ton of new blood from their 1985 release. These fans are the mad consumers of our day, and will buy anything."
1,Broken Hearted,I'm broken hearted one of my (former) favorite bands has a CD out I won't be buying. I listed to it and heard nothing I'd want to hear ever again..The radio stations don't even play anything off of it. I only recall hearing one song from Desire Walks On (Will You Be There) played on the radio...............sad very sad.
4,Great album no matter which Heart you like better,"Jupiter's Darling is a great new offering from Heart, picking up pretty much where they left off on ""Desire Walks On"" except the songs are fresher and the Wilson sisters sound revitalized. Even though die-hard Heart fans have come to like the overblown 80's ballads like ""What About Love"" as guilty pleasures, I think we all know the true Heart is the Heart of the ""Dreamboat Annie"" and ""Little Queen"" days. Heck, even the Heart of the ""Bebe Le Strange"" and ""Private Audition"" days. And, ""Jupiter's Darling"" is a return to the pure rock sound that made Heart famous in the first place. I think most Heart fans will be very pleased with this. There are plenty of those overblown ballads on other CD's. Just listen to their greatest hits if you have a hankering for that stuff."
2,It's a grower,"This CD is a grower. I have to admit that upon the first couple of listens I was disappointed but after several times through I have really come to appreciate it. I used to feel the same way about the good Elton John albums in the 70's. I would open them up, put them on the turntable and hate every song because they had odd lyrics and quirky arrangements. Now I wish Elton would return to his adventurous and interesting musical arrangements. Well, Heart has done just that. What I didn't appreciate at first listen has grown on me and I appreciate their creative arrangements. It makes music much more fun and interesting. I find that the records that I did not like right of the bat end up being my favorites. I am just glad that I give them a fair chance to get to know them."
5,Heart is BACK!,"I have been a fan of Ann and Nancy Wilson since the early '80's. Although it was their 80's music that got me interested, I wound up loving their early work the best. So this album is a real treat! It incorporates the wonderful harmonies, melodies, and guitar work from their earlier work, but keeps the sound current for today. Those people who are providing negative reviews here are obviously not real ""music fans"". If you love Heart's music, especially their early work, then you'll love this album."
1,They Shouldn't produce their own album,"the purchase from amazon was an excellent experience, but Heart doesn't seem to be able to self-criticize. the only decent song is #10 and they didnt write it. i have ALL their music published and am a serious fan of their work EXCEPT this one."
4,Jupiters Darling review,"I have been a fan of Heart's for twenty years and this has got to be one of the best CD's this band has ever put out. It is a unique balance of hard rock and slow ballads. but more rock on this one than ever. And the slow songs have serious taste. Not the ballads of Heart's hair band days in the 80's. They are really solid and substantial. And if you are looking for some Zeppelin-ish blow your doors down rock check out the song Fallen Ones.Definately well worth it and for non Heart fans, it will grow on you."
3,A Long Wait For New Heart,"I was anxious for this new release from Heart. My love affair with their music has run hot and cold over the years, and upfront I must disclose that I tend to like the ""popier"" tracks vs the ""rockier"" ones. Speaking sentimentally I was glad when I heard Ann and Nancy were back in the studio working on new music. JUPITER'S DARLING is a top notch release, even though it contains to much rock for my taste. The ballads fall short of the groups past efforts which evoked so much emotion from the listener, and had soaring vocals by Ann. My favorite tracks on this album are ""Make Me"", ""Things"" and ""Perfect Goodbye"". I also like the hook on ""I give Up"". Ann and Nancy, glad to see you back!"
1,Major Disappointment !,"It's been a long time since their last album, and ""Jupiter's Darling"" just doesn't measure up to the standards this great band had set for itself."
3,almost 11 years since last full studio lp...,"When I heard that Ann & Nancy Wilson were recording as ""HEART"" again and not the Lovemongers, and not releasing ANOTHER live cd, I was pretty excited. Being a long time Heart fan I was also thrilled when I heard it referred to as a ""return to roots"" cd and all that.Well, the cd has some good songs, but to me, no great songs. My favorites are Make Me, The Oldest Story In The World, The Perfect Goodbye and Move On. Anything sung by Nancy I really don't like. Her voice just isn't as strong as big sis Ann's.Overall, after waiting so long for a new Heart cd, I thought this would be a lot better."
2,Not bad? Not good? Not bad? bad eh ?,"I honestly tried to like this cd. Im a die hard Heart fan but this cd reminded me of someone trying to cling on to the music biz. What a price to pay. Nothing thrilling stood out on this cd. A few twist and turns with shabby guitar work, but even that is questionable. No one song stood out and i didnt even feel any real powerful vocal output that is Ann's trademark."
4,THIS IS WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE,"I have always had a soft spot for Heart but wasn't so happy with ""Desire Walks On"" which tried to span the two styles the band has visited being the eighties slick sound and the bittersweet seventies balladry and rock. From the first few listens to this CD it seems they have finally blended all aspects of their sound successfully into one opus. Perhaps two or three songs too long but all the same an absolute delight. Early listens suggest the beautiful ""Enough"" is a highlight and the opening combo of ""Make Me"" (see Silver Wheels) and ""Oldest Story"" set the mood well. ""Vainglorious"" seems heavy handed in the ""Tall Dark Handsome Stranger"" mode from Brigade but later highlights such as ""Fallen Ones"" with its rock out jam feel and sparkling bridge passage, and the seven minute simplicity of ""Lost Angel' save the second half of the CD and ensure that you come away feeling satisfied."
2,A disappointment,"After reading many reviews that said this album was reminiscent of ""old Heart"" (as in thier 1970s music), I have to say I don't believe it. Too many songs are loud and aggressive just for the sake of being loud and aggressive. It's hard to find a memorable melody. If you're a fan of the Dreamboat Annie / Little Queen / Dog and Butterfly days, this album will be a disappointment."
5,Oh Yeah!,"If you are like me and an old fan of Heart since the 70's but have been disappointed with their over-produced 90's era, then look no further! This album is arguably just as good or better than their offerings in the 70's. There are acoustical as well as electric rock offerings here that will not disappoint. The band has never sounded better in this line-up. The only disappointment, and a minor one indeed, is that Ann only sings on this offering but it doesn't matter. Nancy takes front and center here with vocals and various instrumentation. The album is wonderfully crafted and even the CD is packaged beautifully. I would recommend this to any old Heart fan who longs for their earlier edgy sound as well as any new, curious fan. It is no wonder that Heart deserves a high place in the rock world rarely reserved for the female artist and were sometimes called the ""female"" Led Zeppelin...true or not, this CD is a classic offering!"
2,B.L.A.N.D.,"Ann Wilson's Voice is still stellar. Too bad the material for this album IS NOT. I was hoping for at least a couple of stand out tracks...maybe something like Black on Black (from the album ""Desire Walks On""). Nothing like that here."
3,perfect Goodbye,"I love anything heart does,,, I'm a huge fan but the only songs that spoke to me were lost angel and perfect goodbye"
2,not good,I have been a Heart fan a long time.A lot of people will give a good review to one of there favorite groups no matter what.Not me.This cd seems like it was meant to make the heavy medal group and old time heart fans happy.I thought it sucked to say the least.And I DID listen to it and gave it a chance.Ill pass on this one.Oh well.
4,"Seems to be a good book, have not read it yet","I haven't read this book yet, though it seems to be a good one. I bought it for a college course, and it turns out that I may not have needed to buy it."
5,Medicine man,I am a fan of Sean Connery & have most of his movies. So this was a no-brainer to get. I never get tired of watching.
5,Better Than Bond,This is one non-James Bond that should be in the DVD library of a family's home. Great to watch over and over. Sean Connery gets better with age. It is the first movie that the leading lady looks good with a tattoo. Just the perfect touch to compliment Lorraine Bracco.
4,Interesting role for Sean Connery,"This movie definitely put Sean Connery in a different light. He, at first, is not believable but as the movie gains speed, he is perfect for the role."
2,Pointless?,Really still haven't figured why Connery agreed to this project. The story was predictable and held no surprises. The acting by the female lead was about as bad as it gets.
5,Great movie!,I first watched this film at a movie theatre when iut first opened and have loved it ever since.It is very interesting and keeps you on the edge of your seat and has many funny parts for both the actors.I am very happy with the fast shipment and the customer service ppl i talked with.
5,Medicine MAn,This movie is one of my very favorite. It is in great condition and came in a timely manner I do enjoy this DVD
2,Poor Quality Transfer,"This is a fantastic movie, and I am so disappointed to receive this DVD version. The transfer is grainy and poor, and what format is this anyway?? Why did I buy a widescreen TV just to watch this ""letterboxed"" version that appears with black bars on both the top and bottom AND sides. I feel like I'm watching it from a tunnel. Please someone give us a widescreen digitally mastered version so that we can see the incredible scenery from this movie! Honestly, my VHS copy is better than this."
5,good movie and great shipper very fast!,"I bought this movie because I hadn't seen it in a long time I reccomend it, it is cute and very entertaining , Even safe for kids . It came quickly too !"
5,Loved it,This is the greatest movie of all times. I wanted this copy because my old one got damaged. I love it and am glad I found it here.
2,"Great promise, greater disappointment.","Medicine Man is seriously flawed. Some of the photography is very appealing, but the writing is amateurish with a silly plot and ignorant repartee. Even worse was the casting. Connery is a believable male lead, and anything that makes the movie passable is to his credit, but why was Lorraine Bracco cast opposite Connery? There is zero chemistry between the two, and she is just completely inappropriate for the role. Acting is more than yelling and screaming and exhibiting obnoxious behavior. It was a struggle to actually finish watching it.There is yet to be made a quality movie on this subject."
2,Mediocre Man,"...It took a provocative idea and turned it into a silly action movie instead of a thoughful drama. Connery is fine as always, but Bracco grates...There's even a preachy save the environment message thrown in at the end..."
2,People actually like this dud of a movie. Give it a try.,"A king sized helping of irritating with a dollop of boring. I can't believe this movie is liked by so many people. It was mildly interesting as far as ""old jaded scientist hates greenhorn until he starts liking her"" formula movies go. But the chemistry between them bit! Which made the musical score really funny when you hear the first ""triumphant"" symphonic piece. You frown and say, ""I don't get it, I thought they still hated each other...is this 'Gone with the Wind' drama because she likes the view from the ropes?"" And Lorraine Bracco's character is soooo annoying. The fact that he wants her to return with him isn't even believable. Connery's okay, but a bad match for his style. I watched the whole thing though, and other people liked it. But, like one of the other reviewers wrote, I figured out the cure for cancer before the characters did. And so will you!"
1,Reel bad,"I thought this movie was a huge stinker. I couln't believe how bad the acting and plot of the story was. My family already figured out what the ""cure"" for cancer was before the characters even came close. Other parts of the movie seemed ridiculous as well. . . trash this one."
4,Medicine Man and the Peace Corps,"Medicine Man is a joyful and funny movie. What most people may not know, though, is that how things are depicted in Medicine Man is how it can be in the Peace Corps. The interaction between ""Bronx"" and Dr. Campbell, and the Indians is how it was between Peace Corps Volunteers, and between the volunteers and the ""host country nationals"" For me, it is a trip on a ""time machine"" to watch Medicine Man."
1,Worst DVD Transfer Ever,"This is my favorite movie of all-time and finally decided to get the DVD since my VHS player was now gone. I am a movie buff so when say ""The worst"", I mean ""worst."" I have watched ""B"" and ""C"" junk movies that looked much better than this.The movie fades in and out, the focus is off many times, it even jumps in two places, you cannot see anything when there are fog shots, super grainy in all dark shots (many), and the artifacts are downright distracting.Honestly, the VHS is of better quality.Do NOT WASTE your TIME or MONEY on this fantastic movie until they re-master it for Blu-Ray.It has been 20 years, so you would think an anniversary edition was in the works but since nothing could be found that is why I bought the DVD. It was a MAJOR mistake.Movie: 5 Stars DVD: 0 Stars"
1,Stuck in the Amazon,"Sean Connery and director John McTiernan wanted to try something different, but ""Medicine Man"" (1992) was the wrong project. Cranky scientist Connery gets saddled with an obnoxiously miscast Lorraine Bracco in this dreary environmental jungle adventure. A disastrous attempt to emulate ""The African Queen"" and ""Romancing the Stone."" Jerry Goldsmith's overlooked score remains the sole redeeming feature."
4,medicine man,sean connery and lorraine bracco act on two different levels but come together as one in serch for a cure for cancerin the amazon with great scenery and romance at the ending
4,medicine man,Great movie...very true to life....been there done that...gives on somethng to think about...almost all of our newe medicine come this way...oiur medicine men are only different that the theirs in there dress and equipment.........james
3,A forgettable Sean Connery movie,"There is good footage about the jungles of South America (Mexico?). A weak story enlivened only by the presence of Sean Connery. I saw this movie because of my wish to see all Sean Connery movies. He is a medical scientist, in the jungles for the last 6 years and now has found the cure for cancer. There are grave basic errors in the way the jungle extract, this cure for cancer, has been isolated. It is thought all along that the cure is in a flower, but that is not so. The story does not seem credible. The narrative is overlay ed by commercial interests who are clearing the jungles for commercial land use, and which will effectively destroy the source of this 'cancer cure'. But, the action is poorly dramatized. It was funny to see Sean Connery practicing his golf tee-off in the jungle!"
5,Leonard Malton is quite wrong,"I am so offended by Leonard's review that I just HAVE to write at rebuttal.When I first saw this movie on the big screen it was utterly breathtaking. The scope, depth, humour, and characterizations were all excellent. Then there was the incredible view from the top of the forest canopy!I also lament that theatres are shrinking here in Houston. So the really big screen that helped generate that reaction are becoming rare. I have no way to afford a home theatre of a scale to get the impact of that moment.I have the PAL VHS and am buying the widescreen DVD now that I have a DVD player.If you are considering the purchase of film, I strongly recommend it.Sorry Leonard, but this is no where near the only ""miss"" that you have published. It is time to grow a deeper appreciation of the world."
2,Dvd Version has at lease 3 nice parts cut out of it.,"If you are going to get this movie in DVD because you liked it on VHS, please keep in mind that the company that released the dvd cut several good parts out of it. I have no idea why, because to me, it is now missing a lot of the good parts."
5,love it,Never liked the slick James Bond of his younger days...love the scruffy character and the story. The love hate relationship is neat...
5,Medicine Man with Sean Connery and Lorraine Bracco in the Brazilian Rainforrest,"This is a very good movie, with the stars listed and a hundred real indians from the rainforrest. The story has a strong message: the destruction of the rainforrest is more important than finding a cure for cancer. Powerful. Good energy. I do hope you will try to view this movie. Maybe you can help Sean find some of his errant golf balls?"
1,wrong size,"This company must not have a ruler or anyone with common sense. I ordered 2"" x 3"" bags and was sent 2"" x 2"" bags. A six year old could be able to tell that the bags that were sent were not 2 x 3. I was given a full refund and was offered the correct size bags but I declined and bought the same product from a different seller and actually got what I needed. I would caution people from buying from a seller who can't tell the difference between 2 and 3 inches."
3,MAKE SURE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE GETTING FIRST,"BAGS ARE SMALL FOR LIKE DIME/NICKEL BAGS!!?? REALLY TO SMALL FOR EARBUDS AND HEADPHONES GO WITH A 5""X5"" MUCH EASIER TO PLACE HEADPHONES IN FOR RESALE OR WHATEVER YOU ARE SELLING"
4,Very good,I liked the book.He was very helpful for my studies in media literacy.I recommend.David is very fluent in their text and in their explanations
2,"Poorly organized, found other sources","I feel this book has most of the information, but it was very cluttered and difficult to follow. This was not a very impressive resource. I used the Sybex book, which has a lot of basic garbage, but had the info I needed in an easy to follow format. I suggest checking out the New Riders Fast Track books for a condensed guide, as they are the best."
1,Too much cut out of this pocket guide.,"This book would make an excellent IIS quick reference, but lacks some key elements to deserve its MCSE name. Having finished my MCSE, I am accustomed to these types of books having bullet points for the major items of interest (aka two minute drills), summaries of the chapter to drive home material, and a few sample questions. This is not a MCSE book."
3,A good book but not the only book for taking the IIS 4 Exam,I like this book since it gives you the details in a straightforward fashion but I don't recommend it to be the only source in taking the IIS 4.0 Exam. It doesn't have the practice exam sheets you can find in other books. It also doesn't discuss ODBC errors and integration of this service with other NT domains.
3,"Clear, but too simple",This book is very good for someone with no prior knowledge of the subject. All the basic things are well explained. However I feel that there is a material not covered. I will have to turn to other sources before taking the test.
3,A decent book only to become acquainted with IIS 4,"While it serves as a good overview of IIS4, it is not enough to pass the exam for most people. Even though, I had no experience with IIS4, the book seemed overly simple. It want step-by-step covering each area of IIS's properties. The book lacked the kind of information that was covered on the actual exam."
4,"Buena Teoria, Poca Práctica","El libro es muy similar al manual del curso oficial de Microsoft. La primera parte es un tanto aburrida y creo que poco necesaria. Explica como hacer para rendir un examen, etc...Tiene muy buenos Tips de que tener en cuenta para el examen, y algunas ideas muy interesantes. Pero poca practica."
4,"Excellent book on ""gnostic"" aspects of Amercan Protestnatism","Lee demonstrates how American forms of Proetstantism do not reflect the ethos of Calvin or Luthur and how American Protestant individualism etc, and much evangelicalism and the charismatic movement are an embodiment of the Gnostic religions of the first few centures of the Common Era. A real eye opener: well researched, passionately argued, and convincing."
4,Points the Way to Rome,"Despite the author's loyalty to orthodox Protestantism, and his attempts to adumbrate it via his extensive analysis and criticisms of gnosticism, its inheritors and their influence on present-day American Protestantism, there seems to me to be an inevitability about his arguments, even if unacknowledged. Namely that, in the end, not in our lifetimes, certainly, but in the end, all roads lead to Rome.I compliment him for his honesty and thoroughness in this regard.A sobering note: Come to find out Rev. Lee's church, St. John and St. Stephen, New Brunswick, CA, no longer exists. Its congregation has been merged with Grace Presbyterian, and now operates under the rubric of Grace Presbyterian, albeit at St. John and Stephen's prior address. Is Rev. Lee still with us?"
3,Everybody's a Gnostic,"Apparently, I'm a Gnostic, you're a Gnostic, we're all Gnostics.In this book, Lee compares the early heresy of Gnosticism with some of the common beliefs and practices in churches today. I don't think any group was left alone. He accuses pretty much everyone.And honestly, he's probably somewhat right. I agree that there are dangerous dualistic, elitist, escapist, and hyper-spiritual tendencies in many Christian circles today. But I'm not sure I'm comfortable accusing everyone of Gnosticism. Just because we have similarities doesn't mean we're Gnostics. I mean, we have many similarities with Muslims, but we're not all Muslims.The ""cure"" wasn't so helpful either. He suggested that we preach. And it should be liturgical preaching in line with the creedal traditions of the church. I'm all for preaching, but I don't think preaching is the cure.All in all, the book is well researched and documented, but the diagnosis and cure both seemed somewhat skewed."
5,Best Car Seat Ever!,"This is the best car seat I have ever used! Very easy to use, especially with the latch system eliminates using the seat belts. This seat has a protector around the bottom of the buckle to prevent burns if the buckle get too hot and fabric covers on the top of the straps to keep kids from getting rub marks on their neck."
1,An Extremely Boring Book That Defies Logic,"When I picked up this book I thought it was going to be a great counterpoint analysis of Marxist Economic theory. Sadly, it is really boring, very difficult to finish. I am an avid reader, however I could barely take this book to the end. And after finishing it I was wholly unconvinced that Marx's theory is wrong."
4,Excellent introduction to Islam for non-Muslims,"For the non-Muslim reader this one small book will provide an excellent introduction to Islam's history, values, and practices.Mahatma Gandhi called this book ""among the treasures of mankind,"" and it was found in Leo Tolstoy's pocket as he lay dying in the fields he used to till.The author, an exceptionally gifted scholar and lawyer was founder of the Pan-Islamic Society of London, and was given the title ""Sir"" by the British government. This book was first published in 1905 by the Society."
2,this book is tiny,did not realize how small this book was I thought it was a regular size book but its my own fault for not checking
2,VERY SMALL,The size of this item fits in the palm of your hand...I anticipated a notebook sized pad but was unsatisfied.
5,Great fun!,My granddaughter loves this book. It's creative and fun but beware it can be messy and the ink stains plastic and acrylic (bathroom fixtures!).
4,"Great fun, be careful with the ink!","Love these little books, great for a child who is at least 4. 5 is better because you need more fine motor control to draw on the details but a well-into-drawing-four-year-old can do pretty well too.One caveat: the ink! It's very stain-prone. This is not something you want to leave where you're 18 mo old can get into it.....or anywhere near white carpet...trust me! :)"
1,11 Years Old,"All I'm going to comment on is the fact that this is still being sold in 2011 and the publication date is 2000!AHA has revised it's cardiac care (BLS, ACLS) alone, twice since then!"
3,This book is too expensive,"Although this book is a valuable resource for actors in all respects looking to further education and employment opportunities, much of this information can be found by doing a ""search"" on the internet and perhaps a little added background investigating. Performing artists and actors of live theatre have it difficult enough to try to ""make ends meet"" from job to job (or lack thereof) on their poorly supported lifestyles and lowly advocated career choices. Support the arts, and lower the price of this mediocre book. Better yet, publish the information for free on an internet website."
5,Love it!!!,"This hamper is the best! Doing laundry could not get easier than this- I just pull out the net, throw contents inside the washer and wallah!! Done!"
4,Looks attractive and gets the job done,"We have had this hamper for six months now and I have no complaints. It is attractive, and doesn't stick out like a sore thumb. The netting makes it easy to get the load to the laundry room. It really holds a decent load for baby clothes. It doesn't take much space, and folds up. We have not had to wash it yet and that is the only reason I'm giving it 4 stars. Once I wash it I will update my information. For only $20.00 I think it was a wise buy."
5,Perfect!,"It is the perfect size for a nursery room (if you don't have a lot of space). It is very cute, COMES ASSEMBLED, and I totally love the fact that it has a liner inside.It is also a great buy! What else could you ask for (for just $20)?"
3,Liked it at first....it's OK,"I loved this hamper when I got it. It holds just the right amount of clothing and I love the mesh insert. Being able to just pull it out on laundry day is great. It looks very cute and it can be folded for storage. However, now that my son is very squirmy, I find that I don't like the cloth cover that hangs over the front. It's difficult to move and throw clothes in using only one hand. The cloth cover is usually just hanging in the back leaving the hamper open so that I can easily put his clothes in. Also, he was able to pull off one of the buttons! I think I will be buying a new hamper with a hinged lid."
4,19 months and still going strong!,"We purchased this for our daughter's nursery and have been using it for almost nineteen months now--and it still is in perfect condition! I was nervous about potential tears to the inside mesh liner (the removable ""laundry bag"" part of the hamper) but have had no problems whatsoever.I love that there is a ""lid"" (a flap of cloth) that folds over the top of the frame to hide the laundry inside--it is the perfect spot for me to keep a small mesh bag (lingerie bag) to put my daughter's dirty socks in...that way we never have to worry about losing socks in the wash!This hamper is very convienent, relatively sturdy, and doesn't scream ""baby""--so if you need to keep it in a room other than the nursery, it won't look too out of place.Now that we're expecting our second child, I plan on purchasing another one of these hampers."
5,son in law was thrilled,"My son-in-law is a great guy and a huge Purdue fan. We had bought his 'main' present for Christmas but needed a couple of little things. Our daughter mentioned that he would like a Purdue golf towel. Not being able to find that in a store, went to Amazon and found this perfect gift set of the towel, tees, etc. I think it was his favorite gift. Great price, arrived on time, was pleased with Amazon as usual."
2,I think the product I bought is old!!!,I think the product I bought is old!!!It was Wrinkled and washed.I is so disappointed to it!I think it is not worthy for its price!
5,An unusual peek into a young scientific explorer's life,"In one small book Dr. Lowman combines serious science, thoughtful reflections on expectations of self, family and scientific peers and fascinating descriptions of life in a threatened ecsystem. Best of all, she writes clearly and with great insight and wit."
2,Horribly listed!!!,"I realize now ""Four Square"" may be the brand of the bowls, but it appears to be 4 square bowls for sale, especially with the photo showing multiple bowls. As you figured out, I just received the one bowl. It is fantastic quality, but I was looking for cheap ceramic simple bowls and I'm so disappointed right now."
3,"Beautiful pictures, simple story","Basically the book counts to 10 and with each number, a picture of a different animal mommy and that number of babies. Cute, colorful illustrations, very simple storyline."
5,Love this little book,"There are four books in this series and I enjoy all four of them. The illustrations are perfect for little ones. Of the four books in the series, this one is a counting book and so it grows with you as your child grows. The other three books are wonderful and allow for interaction with you little person -- you can imitate the kisses, for example, in ""Daddy Kisses""."
5,Mommy Loves,Very cute book. My son loves it. It also has numbers on each page that correlate to the number of babies.
2,A poor album!,"This is the worst album of Maria Bethnia's entire career! If you want to know Bethnia's work, buy ""Diamante Verdadeiro"" or ""Imitao da Vida""."
3,For a magnificent singer a below average recording,"If you are a Maria Bethnia fan, then you'll want this album. If not, buy one of her earlier ones that you don't have (and they are all wonderful) or wait for her next release. I am a great fan of this woman, and for me her voice and her styling have always possessed a magic, regardless of the shifts in her choice of material. Unfortunately that magic is not much in evidence on this album, which makes it a glaring exception in the catalog of her recordings. No tenha medo, Gema and Agradecer e abraar were songs I liked; while the title song seemed run-of-the-mill."
3,uh huh,"again, on time, but should have been 4 dollars or less for the used item, and it could have arrived faster."
2,"Love Her, Love the Show, The Book, Not So Much","Being a FAN of Changing Rooms I ran headlong into purchasing Trade Secrets. I should have read Denise's review first! In too much of a rush. Was hoping the book would be filled with nifty ""how-to's"" for making interiors look fabulous and different by using particular materials and products. Especially the photo transfer to fabric technique seen occasionally on Changing Rooms.Every chapter is a series of Q&A. The book is well-organized and the questions answered in sufficient detial to give the novice decorator some excellent pointers. Pictures would make this book good. Without them, it's barely worth flipping through. I tried desparately to find some reason to keep the book on my shelf, but there's not enough in it for me to make it a worhtwhile reference which I'd consult more that once. So, back in the mail it went. <Sigh>."
5,Inolvidable,"This is the essential Nana Caymmi, it has all the best hits of the novelas that if you like one, then you like them all. I first heard her song, Reposta ao tempo, from watching the Hilda Furacao mini-series, and I could not stop listening to her. I recommend this CD, if you want an insight into one of the best of Brasil, this is the perfect mix of songs if you are starting to discover Nana, and other singers like her."
4,roller skates,The Chicago Men's rink skates are a value and comfortable. The only issue I had with these skates were the bearings only last a couple of hours and then you have to replace them which costs around $30. It would be better if they installed a higher quality bearing in the rollers so that this would not be an issue.Chicago Men's Rink Skate
3,Men's Chicago rink roller skate crs405's,"Chicago Men's Rink SkateThis is the 405 series. My opinion, if your a beginner then this is the skate for you. I did like the boot design. The bearings in the wheels are not that fast. The skate is more designed for those learning to skate. If you wanted to go with the skate for it's price, and if you want to upgrade the skate. You can switch to a better quality of precision bearings and I would recommend a new set a of wheels and you will get a better quality skate over the locale rental skates. Like I said it's great for beginners, I just sent mine back for the Chicago crs805. Both styles the crs405 and the crs805 are known as artistic skates in which you can preform different skate tricks. More advanced ones for the crs805. The bearings are faster and smoother for the crs805. The balance is great, trucks are stronger less wobble more skate control, and the leather binds more with the ankle."
1,Quality Cheap,"I would never buy this product again, the quality of the skate was very poor. The ball bearings are coming out of the skates."
1,shouldent buy,i am a 12 year old boy and my friends and i like to skate a lot so i thought i should get some good skates so i picked these out and they did not work out. the first day i used them my stopper fell of when i tried stopping and the wheels constently got stuck they did not work out so i go home greese em up now the wheels work a little more i try the next day and dident use the stopper and stopped by putting myskate down hard and i looked at my wheels a miniute later and they where sharded up listen if you want skates youll be better of using dora the explorer skates than these pieces of junk
3,"Good boot, bad wheels.","Wheels and bearings are just awful. We were sticking to the rink, not gliding. Boot and trucks are fine, though. Ell upgrade the wheels and bearings."
4,great,used in a play the actor was already a skater but he did fine with them... nothing negitive to add
3,Good but not smooth,"I really like my skates, the quality of the shoe itself is great. They fit and feel like a glove. They are sturdy and comfortable. The wheels are fancy and I love the design and color! My only concern is with the bearings which leave a sort of rumbly ride, they seem to not flow freely, and have drag which makes skating more of a chore than fun. They need a higher quality wheel with a more precision bearing. In all fairness this could also be the quality of the floor at the rink where I skate, however I tried rental skates there and the rumbling doesn't happen with the rented skates. Wish shoes came with a more professional wheel bearing!"
3,Good skates bad bearings,Good value for the skates but be prepaired to replace the bearings. Right out of the box they felt like the wheels were packed with gravel.
2,Very disappointed,These skates are very comfortable... but within ten minutes the stopper had busted. No wonder this item is no longer being sold. :(
5,great,very pleased! THE SKATES ARRIVED ON TIME AND WAS IN THE CONDITION STATED BY THE SELLER. NO PROBLEM 100% PLEASED
4,Ambush Clear Predator Action Figure,cool toy i have it set up in plain site and people still miss it its like real stelth
4,A Diverse Collection,"First, let me say that just when you think the tone of this collection has been set, the next poem completely changes everything. There is such a wide range of raw emotion here, and the author has done a terrific job in managing to bring the reader along an emotional roller coaster ride.There are several stand-out poems here, such as 'A Table for Five', 'Green to Red', 'Winter's Air', and 'Profit for Loss'.The author clearly has a vision of a better world, an idealist in his heart but a realist in his eyes. He sees the world as a work in progress, and is not satisfied with the state of things. For this reason, his poems struck a chord with me, for I too see a world that needs much work. The great thing about this author is that one of his themes throughout this collection is that change starts within yourself.I think I will begin today."
4,A fun read in the tradition of Heinlein,"A fun, action packed, story of mistreated Marines who nontheless uphold the traditions of the Corps. It was easy to identify with the characters and I found the raptor encounters very exciting. Hope to see more from this author!"
5,rail travel in China,"This was an excellent little book that I used on my first trip to China, it is compact and full of useful information about buying tickets and the idiosyncracies of rail travel in China. It doesn't contain as much tourist information as the bigger guide books but does give the traveller all the information that is needed get to get anywhere in China by rail. I used this book to travel by rail from HongKong to Guilin, Kunming, Dali,Chengdu, Xian and Beijing. Obviously the new rail route to Tibet had not been built when this edition was published so a revised edition would be a useful guide"
5,A Great Book for the Backpack,"This is a perfect book to read on the road.It is breezy, witty, intelligent and covers just about any question I've ever come up with regarding airlines and the business of air travel.Anyone who has ever flown should find this book compelling."
4,Great Read,"Very helpful and informative book. He explains things easily and explains them on a level that the average Joe can understand. It isn't the kind of book to read from cover to cover. I fliped through it and read my favorite parts. It will educate you more on flying and will calm your fears. He answers questions that you won't even think of. Neat read, you'll sound like a genius next time you fly."
1,Not a great read for fear of flying,"Not recommended for people with fear of flying. I hate to fly and while this book helps, it has too many sections that aren't related to phobia of flying(Design of planes, business of airlines, etc..) and too much talk of airplane crashes. I recommend ""Flying with out Fear"" instead."
1,"Disappointing, not reassuring","I have to agree with another review that said this book made them feel worse about flying. I figured I would just skip the chapter about air disasters, but in many other parts of the book, the author explains a concept, then proceeds to give an example of how some pilot or airplane went wrong in this area and everyone died. Now I know just how many things can go wrong ... I think ignorance is bliss."
5,"If most of the pilots are like him, I'm safe","Patrick Smith's book, strictly speaking, is not for everyone. The prerequisite is to have some interest in air travel. You don't need to be a nut or an obsessive airliner anorak, but if you live in London and don't know what LHR and LGW stand for, or if the number 747 means absolutely nothing to you, don't buy this book. You will probably be bored.It is true that there are some repetitions (the content is based on regular website contributions) - but then there are so many erroneous stereotypes about air travel that maybe it's worth rubbing the correct information in.Overall, the book is a helpful reminder that someone who is flying your plane is more competent than a passenger and that slightly rougher landing does not mean that the pilot is drunk or had too little training; if you are stuck for an hour waiting for the gate this is not because the pilot is too dim to spot one or is enjoying himself sending text messages from his cellphone."
5,Entertaining and Informative,"Patrick Smith has some great stories, and he gets the facts across in an interesting way. His writing style is so enjoyable to read, it'd probably be an enjoyable book even for someone with a pilot's license who knows about flying. He has a great weekly column [...] too (Fridays)."
3,Uneven and disjointed,"The author is clearly knowledgeabe but the format makes the book almost unreadable. The question and answer approach quickly becomes tiresome; the author's writing style is uninteresting and the book just never gets a rhythym going. There's far too much overlap from one question to another, a number of the questions are just dopey and the author is annoyingly opinionated about a number of topics, particularly post 9/11 security. Although there are some interesting items in the book, I had to force myself to finish the last half."
5,Fun and Informative!,"I picked this booked at JFK and read it on an overnight flight bound for South -America. I found answers to so many basic aviation questions and had a few laughs on the side. This book is fresh, to-the-point, light, informative and fun. Recommended to all those who love aviation and/or are afraid of flying. Suddenly, the 8+hour flight was touching down, safely!"
4,"If you're the curious sort, it's perfect","First you should know this about me: when I'm in a new-for-me airport, my first stop is the gift shop, where I hunt down an airport postcard. Then, at the end of my trip, I turn the postcard over and write down each airport I visited, and the airplanes that took me there. So I guess you could say I'm sort of the target audience for this book.ASK THE PILOT, as others have noted, is a bit disjointed and would benefit from illustrations. But that's picking nits, in my opinion. Even if you've read most of the material in Smith's Salon column, it's nice to have it collected in one place. And if you haven't already read it and you're fascinated by commercial flying -- which describes me pretty well -- then you'll devour this book within a day or two. My only regret is that I didn't see (and buy!) ASK THE PILOT just before my last trans-continental flight."
1,"If you are the least bit nervous about flying, do not read this book","Though this is an informative book on air travel, it is not for those with a fear of flying. Mr. Brown illustrates almost every example of safety equipment on an airplane as the result of such and such crash. He details at least 10 seperate crashes in painstaiking detail. He obviously can't relate well to those nervous about flying as he even mocks the idea of being fearful a couple of times. After reading his book, I have very hesitant about getting back on a plane as all I can think about is all of the different ways a plane can crash."
4,would get 5 stars if it had more info on propeller airplanes,"I am afraid of flying. Not of general flying, do not get me wrong, I do feel safe and secure inside a good jet and the prospect of all those hours when no cell phone is going to ring already makes me want to fly again. But I am afraid of small planes, the ones with propellers only that shake like hell and usually take you to places that are not (yet) full of tourists. This book has great info on how the planes work and how they have a back-up plan (more frequently more then one) for all the important systems. It is a great book to read on the plane, specially the first chapters when Smith is explaining the mechanics involved. I have always been a fan of those great machines that, in a matter of hours, take you from one end of the Earth to the other. Now I give the small ones some trust too."
5,A must-read for anybody who likes to travel,"Kudos to Patrick for writing a very accessible, funny, and eye-opening account of what happens at 30,000 feet, and all the steps along the way. His stories about the old days of flying will entice anybody who still gets excited about airplanes and airports (in a good way). It's refreshing to hear such an articulate and empathic voice come from inside the airline industry. No doubt he's going to be attacked by the many things he says, as he's written one of the most impressive and clear-headed accounts of post-9/11 security hysteria and what it has done to the industry and our country as a whole. This book should be given to all air travelers in lieu of pretzels and headsets. It would do a ton of good."
5,"Well, who is it?","Wow! I was amazed, especially how Sutherland revised his essays on Wuthering Heights and Mill on the Floss. What marvelous insights? What does Lady Dedlock die of? Why doesn't Laura tell her own story in the Woman in White? Read this marvelous book to find out."
1,Its not a CD,"This is not a real linkin park CD... its just some british lady talking about Linkin parks for about 40 minutes.. Some interviews are included, but no way worth the money!!! The CD [...] --- NO MUSIC --- unless you like the accent of a british middle aged woman speaking about the ""controversy"" of Linkin Park.. [...]like they are boy bands, etc. I Suggest no one to buy such a stupid CD, even if u r a fan."
1,Not really Linkin Park,"This CD isn't really either Linkin Park or music... Imagine a bad VH1 documentary and instead of a hot girl talking about the band, insert an old British woman... There are a few pictures on the CD, a color booklet, and a poster. I guess if you have cash to burn, you might want the poster... but the pictures can be found online, and the booklet is just junk.Linkin Park has nothing to do with this CD, it is totally unauthorized and has no music on it, either. Don't be fooled by the blurb on this page, this CD is almost worthless... buy Reanimation or one of the singles instead!"
3,"O.K., but it has no music","This is okay if you're a die hard Linkin Park fan, and if you like a british woman talking about how they evolved into what they are today.It is interesting to learn about them, but there is no music on the CD. Oh well..."
5,Cool for all ages,"I checked out this book because I'm researching the history of England using a very small-town library. I thought it would at least give me some basic information, but, I soon found out that there is a lot (and I mean a LOT) that I never even knew about Stonehenge. (...) It's just a really good book written in really easy to follow, non-techno speech."
3,radio days,"Lovebuzz is a well crafted album and an outstanding entry into the world of power pop. this overlooked Australian group wrote some fine catchy tunes that contain flashes of brilliance as on the swirling ""Blush"" and the sugary jangle-pop of ""Everything You Said."" i'm not sure if they are popular in Australia, but back in 1990, this album would have fit in perfectly with most stuff being played on American college radio."
3,Buy the full-length CD instead,"Although the song ""Overhead Metal Erection"" cannot be found on their full-length album Fall Of The Plastic Empire, this single isn't really worth buying. The other two songs, ""Glass Slipper"" and ""Blood On The Highway"", are both on that CD. Yet neither are even close the best of the Burning Brides. Although they are both very, very good. But, if you love the Burning Brides (like I do) and are looking for any hard-to-find songs by them (also check out the Nirvana tribute Smells Like Bleach and/or the Plank Of Fire single), then buy this single. Otherwise, I highly recommend Fall Of The Plastic Empire instead of this one. I think you'll find it to be much more pleasing."
3,Dissapointed,The product though educational could not hold my sons attention for long.He got bored easily and he usually finds things like this interesting
3,This Document proves one shouldn't mix traditions,"Although I am a great fan of S. Flowers (aka: Edred Thorsson), I was somewhat disappointed with this work. This was probably due to the publisher rather than its author. The book contains a large portion of Christianized ""spells"" which show what our ancestors were up against in fighting these un-believers. As a spellbook it is basicly worthless, but in its ability to show the horrors of mixing traditions it is priceless.If the book was marketed differently it would have scored higher with me."
1,Off track,It should be noted that Stephen Flowers is a mamber of the satanic organization referred to the Temple of Set. Satanism is an offshoot of Christianity. Why anyone would try and combine a twisted middle eastern philosophy to a runic pagan magickal system is beyond me. Claiming this book is actually historically correct is questionable.
4,Humidifier Replacement Filter,"These filters have worked as well as the originals. I have been using one for about a month and it is still doing fine. Following a comment in an earlier review, I have also started adding a humidifier water conditioner and a bacteriostat from Walmart each time I add water. When I was using the original filters the filter would start to loose its ability to wick up water after about three weeks and need to be replaced. Its probably the conditioner more then the type of filter, but this one is lasting longer. I have a wood stove which dries out the air so my humidifier runs almost constantly during the winter."
5,filter,Got humidifier super cheap at yard sale this summer. Filter was about the same price I paid for the machine; but still a very good deal....works perfectly.
3,It works... Kinda,"Bought 3 of them for my MoistAIR humidifier, and they worked fine for a few weeks, then I got a ""Change Filter"" beacon on my humidifier which I thought was weird since the filter was less than a month in the machine, but I changed it anyways and the beacon still has not gone off. I think these filters are meant to work with different humidifiers and not with moist air ones, my humidifier is still working, but it isn't recognizing that I have a perfectly good clean and new filter in it."
2,Was a little too short in length,"As stated in another review, although this states it is a MAF-2 filter and an ""Emerson MoistAir"" brand in its title, it is about 1-1/2 to 2 inches too short for my Essick (was bought-out by Emerson) MoistAir humidifier. I was able to get it in the slots and carefully put the top on but the one end does not make it into the ""final bracket"" that is sort of important for holding it in place. I will be using a different supplier for my next filter to see how theirs fit. The replacement filter I bought at Lowes which is where I bought the humidifier sold ones that fit but had some sort of felt covering on one side. Anyways, it seemed to not last nearly as long as a regular filter so I am on the search for one that fits."
4,Works Good,"I also received a BestAir brand, not the MoistAIR brand as advertised....It's shorter than the Kenmore Brand I should be using, but it works well in our humidifyer. It has a wire-type exterior 'frame' for better reinforcement, and it costs much less than the Kenmore Brand. This, combined with the humidifyer treatment I found for $2 a bottle at Walmart makes a much less expensive way to keep our home humidity up. Keep in mind that you must use humidifyer treatment if your filter gums up or becomes yellow and hardens...that means you have hard water and the water cannot wick up the filster. The life of your filter will be dramatically less if you don't use a treatment."
3,Bait & Switch ?,"I ordered a MAF-1 Emerson MoistAir humidifier filter and received a sub called BestAir Humidwick. When I said would return them , they said these should be as good as the originals. I have no way of knowing until I use them! THAT MEANS i WON'T know until about two months down the road."
2,Short lasting,Item in new condition but it didn't last as long as original mfg. filter. Maybe 6 weeks. It's thinner too.
1,Does not fit as advertised,Well I see many reviews like mine. 3inches to short My model is a Essick MA0800 needs MAF-2 Amazon site claims to fit as well as does the box. It Doesn't.I added a piece of aluminum foil to close off the Grand Canyon sized gap. It will work.The only upside to this filter for what it will fit is has a wire mesh to help support the fragile filter.Not much else to say everyone else hasn't.
1,THIS FILTER DOES NOT FIT,DARN. I wish I had read the first review before ordering this filter. It does not fit - how irritating and misleading. DO NOT BUY THIS FILTER. I wish I could give it less than one star.
2,no aluminum outer mesh,No aluminum outer mesh. Made of cheap paper.It started to harbour fungus in a little over a week.It costs more than the much better ones found at lowes hardware.Better to go to your hardware store and find one that fits and has an aluminum outer mesh.
2,terrible,"this generic product is probably just the same as the name-brand filter at about half the price. also check out the humidifier treatment available from the same vendor. buy enough for a whole season, and you'll save a lot of dough!Edited 11/22/2011: After having this filter in my humidifier for less than two weeks, and consistently using the recommended amounts of bacteriostat and water treatment, this filter began to stink like a wet dog. I previously used the BestAir filter, and assumed that this brand-x filter would perform equally well, but I was wrong. I will be returning the two remaining filters, and will find a source for the BestAir filters I used to buy."
5,Don't miss the point.,"I had to laugh at the above review by someone who felt ripped off because these are lullaby versions! ...Ummm, that's the whole point!! It's a CD of LULLABYEEEE versions, just like the title says. [wink] As many people know, there's a whole series of these, including lullabye versions of Led Zeppelin The Cure, The Eagles, Bob Marley, Pink Floyd, The Beatles, U2, etc. And I think these CDs are esepcially cool for those of us who have children because, obviously, we want to expose our kids to all kinds of music. These lullaby variations are like MAGNETS for young ears, PLUS they're enjoyable for us adults who have loved these songs for many years. I mean, instrumental lullabye versions of Led Zeppelin classics...?! How can you NOT love that?! ;)"
5,The best way to be a Ramones' fan,The best way to be a Ramones' fan. It's very important to start as soon as possible to listen the best music.
2,Baby's got the chills.,"This is exactly what it says it is: lullaby renditions of the Ramones. Instrumental lullabies, not sung lullabies, because many of the Ramones lyrics would be inappropriate for small children. (We're all making a fortune selling Daddy's dope, for instance.) These lullabies are played about half as fast as the Ramones original versions, so they are about twice as long. So, ""Sheena is a Punk Rocker"" clocks in at six minutes long. This is somewhat amusing for a song or two, but over the course of 57 minutes it get kind of boring. But, lullabies are supposed to put you to sleep, so I guess it gets the job done. Just don't play it while you are driving your car."
2,Lame,"This wasn't at all what I expected. I thought I was buying a CD of Ramones cover songs. I expected to have it slowed down a bit, maybe sang by kids or some lady with a soothing voice... but no. There is no singing. It is all instrumental and it sounds like it was done in some kids bedroom with a casio! My 2 month old didn't seem to mind - but I think I wasted my money. I'll just put on the real Ramones for him instead."
5,A continuation of 'The Prophet' and almost as beautiful.,I discovered 'The Prophet' in '85 ... why didn't anyone tell me there was a book that continued the story of 'The Prophet'? Stirring wisdom nested in beautiful verbal imagery.
2,not like the prophet,Great service great condition. I loved the Prophet and didn't care for this book at all. It didn't resonate with me and I didn't understand it most of the time. Quick read not moving.
5,So you wanted details about the sweet trade???,"If you like pirate stories but also to be capable of telling fact from mere fiction, while having some fun, this is your book. It pretty much covers it all, as other reviews already have informed. My only whish here is to back them up. Good read, anécdotas interesantes,5 stars.Buena Bernson"
4,Top Notch Baseball Read,This is one of the better books about baseball I've read. Mike Vaccaro is one of the top sports columnists in the country and he makes a very good transition to book author. The interweavingof history and the present is well done and kept me interested throughout. Recommended for fans of either team. Entertaining and informative.
2,**Yawn**,"Rented this on CD as a part of a long road trip. While giving SOME new insight, this is more like a summary of boxscores turned into a book. I was expecting MUCH more from this...instead, I got hours dedicated to 2 games and minutes dedicated to the other 98 years mentioned in the title."
1,Lisa B,"I was highly disappointed with this. Not the content, but the fact that it was only around 16 minutes long! I rented this thinking that I'd be able to view all 3 sections listed. NOT SO! I felt pretty ripped off after renting it...VERY DISAPPOINTING!!!"
1,never ship,"they said ship 2, 3 days, three weeks later still not ship, have to cancel it and go buy locally(my kid's school start), amazon stock never show correctly"
1,Not a Pulitzer,"I began to look for the pulitzer quality from the very first page. What I found was a disappointment. The story itself is mundane and rambling. Though the father is a selfish and controlling figure, the characters are nothing other than ordinary. The book offers nothing to savor...no excitement, no wit, nothing to whet the reader's curiosity."
1,Dreadfully boring,There are few books I wish I never read and this is one of them. There was nothing redeeming about it. Spare yourself the waste of time and do not read it.
4,poignant story of dysfunctional southern blue bloods,"The Carver family is seriously dysfunctional. The father was betrayed in business and then proceeded to destroy each of his children's love lives. He then grows old, becomes a widower and wants to remarry. The book looks back on the life of his son and his relationships with family and father. No one in the book is particularly likable including the narrator. But it is interesting to hear the voice of this ""well-bred"" southerner and think his thoughts regarding his family. The story is well told through flash backs and ends well. I found the play between father and son particularly interesting and while I didn't see myself in Phillip or my father in his, I did relate to the father-son interplay through them and found myself cheering for their relationship."
4,The March of Time,"Like many southern writers of his generation Peter Taylor is very much interested in the march of time and its effects on society. Although Taylor's works focus on the ""society"" of Nashville and Memphis for the most part and not the agrarians of the rural south, his themes are much the same. The breaking down of old loyalties, manners, faiths, and relationships by the pluralisms of modern life.A Summons To Memphis has already been described by other reviewers and I'll leave that as it is. Taylor's fiction is a much wider target than the simple story of Phillip Carver and his transplanted family in Memphis. By all means read this book and spend some time with Taylor's masterful short stories as well."
2,A Summons to Memphis,"I must admit I found myself rereading several pages, not because I thought they were great, but because they were so boring I think I kept dozing off or tuning the story out. I have to give the author credit he did manage to tell a story, just not one I found interesting. I was stunned to find out it won the Pulitzer Prize!!! I may be harsh on this one but, I just didn't like it. If you read this and liked it please let me know why."
4,Didn't really get it,"Peter Taylor has a very nice writing style and I didn't necessarily find the book boring but I did question what it was about? I didn't really get why Phillip resented the father for moving them from Nashville to Memphis when he was an adolescent. Families move all the time and adjust. If there was something deeper there, I didn't catch it."
3,Lap Harp,The First Act Discovery FG500 Lap Harp comes with 10 printed cards of marked notes for nursery rhymes and some other songs that are not most desired choice for play. The chords are too simplified to make the lap harp a desireable instrument for even a child. The recommendation would be to package or make available a CD or book like other First Act instruments with varing degrees of difficulty. That is the feature that I enjoy the most of First Act--their instructive CDs and books. The instrument is of good quality with a tuning key and pick.
3,Constantly having to tune,This is a fun little instrument. I like the music sheets it came with and how they fit under the strings. My main issue with this lap harp is that we have to tune it ALL THE TIME.
4,"Durable, Fun, and Easy to use","I work for a non-profit discovery museum. We used this instruments as part of a changing space. With school tours coming in, we had hundreds of kids playing with this harp per day. While it is true that tuning it is a bit tough (I did eventually learn to keep it in tune with itself as well), the instrument survived nearly three full months of hands-on play--probably thousands of kids battered this harp. The string never had to be replaced, the wood never cracked. (And we did have a cracked ukulele, maracas, drums that were punctured, etc.)If you have a rowdy kid and anyone handy with a little musical ability (for tuning) I would absolutely suggest the First Act Harp. We rave about it here."
2,As a fan of Kelly Brook I'm sorry to report...,"Yes I will admit I bought this movie only because it features Kelly Brook! I read the description and thought I might possibly enjoy the movie for it's other merits. I'm usually a fan of action, adventure, thriller type movies and about 10 minutes into this movie I realized I was watching a Euro Chick flick. It was not quite as shallow as most American chick flicks but almost.Okay. I have to admit I was expecting/hoping to see Kelly in some sexy clothes and maybe a bikini or even a nude scene. There was none of the above.You might like this movie if you want to watch a chick flick.If you are fan of Kelly Brook you should check out Survival Island.Survival IslandIt's an adventure movie and Kelly is in a bikini showing off her nice legs and everything else for the entire film.-"
5,School of Confidence!,"I actually saw this movie on cable, and had to purchase it for my collection! Although it has no subtitle options (because sometimes the British accents can be hard to understand for an American (like myself :), the movie was quite enjoyable. Initially I thought the movie was about learning the art of seduction, but it's about coming into your own, and accepting everything that makes a woman confident and self-sufficient!"
4,A girls movie,"This is a great movie for the girls. It brought different types of women together. The movie did have a funny side and a serious side, but it was about girls helping each other when they needed it the most."
1,VERY POOR,Product performs very badly sticking product and making very hard to remove from I am very unhappy with performance of this pan
2,Threw it out,"I was planning to bake biscotti cookies in this pan. I didn't use parchment paper, like I usually do when I bake.The dough stuck to the bottom and I could hardly get the stuck part out. So, I threw the pan out."
5,Great cake made in this half round loaf pan,"I have a favorite cake that I make in this half round loaf pan. So easy and so delicious, it looks and tasts like you were working all morning. I make this when I need a special cake but I don't have a lot of time."
1,We're very disappointed,The sound is simply bad. People can't hear us properly when we speak and it was like this from day one. Had to buy new phones (of a different make) a month after buying these as it is a sheer disappointment.
3,Can't tell a difference,It shipped great and was as advertised. I just can't tell its doing anything positive or helping in any way with digestion.
1,Didn't work for my mom..,I got this product for my mom because she has major constipation issues. She didn't notice any difference.He stomach still felt bloated and she was still majorly constipated.
4,Gas is virtually gone,"Although my gas problems are much better when I take one of these before at least one meal a day, it is sometimes hard to remember to do so. The only downside seems to be that I have been gaining weight. Maybe it's just a coincidence, but I know my eating habits haven't changed."
5,"Classic, brilliant... will someone wake the publisher?","I can't believe this brilliant collection of thrilling fiction is out of print. Someone should wake the publisher, add a new introduction by Stephen King some great cover artwork by say William Joyce and watch the thing go right back on the New York Times bestseller list. This is great stuff!"
5,Skin Cancer Must,"I bought this hat for my sister who recently had a malignant skin cancer removed from her nose (she is only 43 - yipes.) She can't say enough about this hat. She cannot get any sun on her face and loves the versatility the hat provides for all her outside activities - she has 3 active kids. She says it is very comfortable, airy and she can wear her hair in a ponytail comfortably. It also stays put on windy days or on the boat. She highly recommends it and loves it. I thought I would share..."
2,Not so durable,"I work as a yardener. I wear this khaki-colored (Amazon says I purchased the stone color, but I ordered and received the khaki-colored one) sun hat daily in the Florida sun. After only 6 weeks the color has dramatically faded, it's discolored to an orangy color on the brim and after only a single run through the delicate cycle in the washer, the grommets rusted. I am really disappointed. I want to stay safe from the sun, but look professional while doing so. The hat just makes me look like I am wearing some dirty rag on my head.I liked the idea of ventilation, but there is none. In order to keep it on your head, you have to use the drawstring, which negates any possibility of ventilation, making this hat extremely hot.Perhaps if you're just wearing this for a day trip things will be better, but if you're wearing this on a daily basis, know that it is not comfortable, durable, colorfast nor washable in the washer."
2,not worth it,"I ordered the hat for a hiking trip. My husband thought it's very ugly. When I try putting a cold pack in the zipper pouch to simulate ice cubes, it felt very heavy and uncomfortable. I will just stick to using a neck wrap for now. Also I couldn't tighten the hat enough that I felt it won't blow away in strong wind. I sent a request to return the hat. Had to wait 3 days with no reply from seller. I sent a message again and got a rude response from the seller. Anyway, once everything was sorted out, my refund notice was pretty prompt."
1,Great idea.,"Great idea, but it didn't fit and look right on me. Looked for something else that was more my style."
5,Great hat to protect from the sun. The clip to attach to the shirt is valuable in high wind conditions.,Great hat and I recommend it to all my friends. Keeps the sun off the back of the neck too.
5,Great Hat!,I feel ridiculous in this hat but it's the best hat I've ever had when working outside.Its light weight and doesn't add to the heat.I love this hat
3,Good for the price,Good protection for the eyes and head. But not that good for the neck especially when the sun comes from laterals..
5,Extra Extreme!,"I purchased the sun blocking shirt a year earlier, and was amazed at how pale my torso had become but I always felt a little awkward b/c my head still managed to get some sun and become a little tan. Well, let me tell you, this hat is the answer! And the question is: Is there any way to make my head look like a blindingly bright light bulb?The only admonition I would give is don't wear this hat and the matching sun blocking shirt together, unless you WANT to be mobbed by ladies!"
4,Sun Stop Hat,A good Hat. We go rafing in the sun and this hat keeps you in the shade and cooler. One good feature is the clip that keeps it on your head in wind or falling in the water. Good buy and it looks nice on also.
2,cheap hat,"For the purpose of keeping the sun off your neck and face, this hat hardly fits the job description.It would be the perfect size for a toddler but the ~3.5 inch brim is simply not enough material necessary to block sunlight (a baseball cap is more effective).The cloth sheet in the rear is also too small. You walk around awkwardly adjusting it because every time you turn your head it gets shifted about. If it were longer and weighted down it would stay put.Finally, I thought the material would be nice (looks like canvas) but really its just a cheap nylon/cotton towel shaped like a hat. It looks like something you would win at an arcade.If you think these are exaggerations keep in mind the hat is priced like an expensive piece of sports gear; these things should uphold worst case scenario weather performance standards.I returned mine immediately after receiving it."
4,it fits,"i was surprised this hat fit my big dome. and i really like the pocket in the in the neck flap, really spacious. Good hat for the price."
3,Not bad,"It certainly protects you against UV but sweat might be a problem. Although there are others which doesn't make you sweat, this one worth the price, especially for activities like fishing, beach walk, sea..., but for hiking I recommend something cooler"
5,Most Enjoyable CD I've Bought This Year,"This is an extraordinarily solid collection of classic urban rhythm and blues, ranging from well-known hits like Curtis Mayfield's ""Superfly"" to underground gems like Gil Scott Heron's ""The Bottle."" There's lots of music (over 2 1/2 hours), it's well sequenced, and the sound quality is excellent. One of the joys of this sort of music is staying with the groove, and you get long versions of quite a few of the tracks, including the 10-minute take of ""Papa Was a Rolling Stone.""Perhaps I'll get a few ""not helpful"" votes for saying this, but the contrast between this music and today's rap is striking and more than a little depressing. Many emotions are expressed here -- rage, joy, determination, longing and fatalism. But this is music about surviving in a harsh environment. It's not music that celebrates the pathologies that help make the environment harsh in the first place."
5,Another Triumph for Monica Hughes,"It is a long time since I read this book, but I still clearly remember the images that it created. It is about the three countries Komilant, Kamilant and Roshan. Roshan is the poor neighbour of the other two countries and so Antia, Princess of K&K, really does not want to go there to meet her future husband. However when she does she discovers there is much more to the place than sandy desert as she finds herself in the middle of a dreadful struggle between greed and corruption and pure goodness. This is a book about truth, love and self discovery. I loved it when I first read it, and every time after. I would strongly recommend it to anyone, along with its equally good sequel ""The Promise"".I aplogise if I have got any details wrong - I haven't read it for about six years."
1,Warning! Both discs are the same!,"I bought this DVD and returned it twice! Both discs are the same. Both are parts 1 and 2 of the series. While the labels on the discs are correct, disc 2 is not part 3 and extra features. It is parts 1 and 2 repeated again!"
3,Light Vampire Romance,"I collect vampire/lycanthorpe books and have quite a collection. Because of this, I have quite a few Amanda Ashley novels. All of her novels are very light reads. The characters usually do not have that much depth, and it is a good quick read if you are looking for a light vampire romance. Analisa is in a hospital dying when an ""angel"" comes and helps her to live. Analisa's family is very poor and when she leaves the hospital, she has nowhere to go. For some unknown reason she finds out she has a benefactor and is welcomed into the home of the mysterious Lord Alesandro. Lord Alesandro is a mystery to Analisa. He has money and has provided her a home, and she has no idea why. Also, she never sees her mysterious benefactor. Lord Alesandro is a vampire who is fighting a growing attraction to Analisa. This was a very predictable vampire romance. Still, I would recommend."
1,Oh My Never Again!,"My Goodness! This was the worst book I have ever read!!I am a huge vampire book reader and this book, sadly read right after Ann Rice's Interview With The Vampire came to me as a shock of terror. First, repetition occurs in this book like no other I've read in my life.The words repeat and so do sentences. Then, the plot is stupid. It is so plain, wow a good guy, a good girl, and a bad guy. WOW.and FINALLY, the vocabulary usage is non-existant. It is the simplest elementary school book ever. I could not stand it. It was absolutely horrid."
3,HAVEN'T WE DONE THIS BEFORE?,"I, TOO, WAS THROWN INTO DEJA VU WHEN I STARTED THIS BOOK. I THOUGHT ""I READ THIS BEFORE"" BUT IT WAS NEWLY PUBLISHED!! IF YOU HAVEN'T READ ONE OF MS. ASHLEY'S VAMPIRE ROMANCES, I WOULD SUGGEST TRYING ANY ONE OF THE OTHERS."
3,smut!!!,"Very easy to read, a bit to predictable. A lot of repitition of daily activities. I love Vamp novels and also the historical era. so this suited me just fine i really prefer Christine Feehan whome i can never get enough of. I am currently on my second Ashley novel and find it a bit boring. she is however a newer writer so i hope to see more progress with time. Just wish writers would stop looking at the $$$ and start putting a little more imagination in this type of romance. it seems as if Ms. Ashley hasn't really reserched the topics surrounding her stories in depth. however, for a light thoughtless read it was pretty good. I couldn't put it down from sheer curiousity for what would happen to the characters."
3,"Not her best, but a good read.","...I was ...disappointed in the fact that the hero broke a solemn promise to our heroine. The fact that he did so because he thought it was for her own good doesn't asuage my feelings about it. To me, a vow is a vow, and a hero loses my respect when he goes back on his word. All is made right in the last few pages, but I was left with a bad taste in my mouth.I really enjoy Ms. Ashley's books, and I will buy her next one, no doubt, but I had expected more from Midnight Embrace. In the back of the book she writes that her editor told her it was the ""perfect vampire story."" I would have to disagree."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I wish I had never purchased it. Since there were few books to choose from, I picked that one but I started it and haven't even finsihed it. Perhaps I'll go back to it one of these days but I found it not holding my interest."
2,eh,"I started to read this, but it's not grabbing my attention. It seems it is very predictable/typical vampire story. I may or may not end up finishing it."
3,It wasn't bad but could have been better,This book was a great for ideas but there was no detailed instruction. This book was more of an overview of digital painting and not a teaching book-The photos were very good
3,"Good, but a little dated","This book is a little dated, and many magazines cover the same techniques, although in less detail. That's the problem with writing (and publishing) a book that's based in changing technology: By the time the book comes out, it's already a little old.If you're interested in creating digital fantasy images for your professional work, this book probably offers enough unique material to make it a worthwhile purchase.I'd also recommend this as a fine reference for public and school libraries.However, for personal use--unless you specialize in this field--it's probably better to look for newer versions of similar books."
3,humidifier,at the moment not very happy with product..since starting to use we get a cloud of fog in the house and a film of dust EVERYWHERE
5,"LINDA CHANDLER'S ""SALES MAGIC"" IS PURE MAGIC PLUS COMMITMENT","I just finished listening to the audio tape program ""SALES MAGIC"" by Linda Chandler and was impressed by the no nonsense approach taken by Ms. Chandler. Having been a sales master in two very competitive industries--securities and investment banking--Linda knows what it takes to succeed in such a tough environment. It's wonderful that she is sharing her sales secrets with us. Order this audio program today--you won't regret it!!! Linda's 7 principles of sales mastery and the 21 habits are proven winners to produce consistent,profitable sales for all salespeople who follow these guidelines. THREE CHEERS FOR LINDA!"
5,THIS AUDIO PROGRAM BY LINDA CHANDLER IS DYNAMITE!!!,"I saw Ms. Chandler during a television interview and she sounded like she knew a lot about selling. I order ""Sales Magic: The 7 Principles of Sales Mastery"" and was very impressed with the depth of knowledge she shared. I am recommending this audio program to my whole sales force."
3,not the in-depth tome that I expected,"Having read the reviews, I expected a lot of deep information. I was mistaken. It is not a bad book, but if it stands out, it is mostly because the majority of Java authors figure that publishing a poorly documented API is adequate. I'd call this an intermediate level book.It lacks a permuted index, which is a must for a book like this. A lot of the nitty-gritty information is presented as an aside to demonstrating the examples instead of a well thoughout discussion. Some of these are in the index and some are not.If you're looking for thorough discussions of the AWT architecture, keep looking. If you're looking for a good discussion of how to use layouts, this might be the book for you."
1,Does nothing for me,I have used almost the entire kit on a single wart on my hand and no change at all. If you leave the cold thing on your skin for a long time it starts to really hurt sometimes. That hurting didn't kill my wart though.
2,Didn't work that well for me,"I used this on plantar warts and no success, it just didn't do it for me."
1,Does Not Work,"Quite simply this product does not work. Despite following the directions, I could barely feel a chill when the applicator was pressed against the skin. Not even the top layer of skin was destroyed."
2,Not easy,"This book has alot of great ideas, but they took too much time for me to make and the supplies were costly."
4,Excellent Tips and Techniques,"Personally I thought the book was really helpful. But then I am of the type to be greatly inspired by seeing what others are doing. I enjoyed looking at the beautiful full color photographs.I am also a scrapbooker, so I owned the majority of the tools mentioned, and for what I didn't own, it was easy to substitute something else.I like the way Julie's books are designed. They are sectioned by subject and quite easy to follow. She gives simple directions with photographs to guide you. I think the ideas are plentiful and are really great for a beginner to intermediate card maker."
4,Quick & Clever Instant Cards,Got a lot of great ideas from this book. glad to have it in my library of books.
1,Broke after 3 uses,Piece of junk broke after 3 light uses. Nothing like the shaver I got at AVN convention..Years back. Either a knock off or they turned junk.
4,I love those english mysteries.,"I love all lthe british mysteries especially the Agatha Christie ones, e.g., Hercule Poirot & Miss Marple. I love all the ladies that have portrayed Miss Marple but I think I like Julia McKenzie the most."
3,Don't know yet if I like this portrayal,"I was really disappointed when I learned that Geraldine McEwan wasn't returning in Marple #4. Having said that, I have watched this new actress and I'm just not sure if I like her portrayal. Joan Hickson and G. McEwan played the part as the brilliant spinster who observed and unobtrusively helped the police solve the crimes. Ms Mckenzie portrays the part more as a detective, I can't wrap my head around this. I hope she will grow on me. Normally, I would rate any Miss Marple series with 5 stars, just can't do that with this one. I rated this series with 3 stars with hope that the series will get better."
1,I agree with other reviewers - I hated this series,"I agree with the other reviewers who disliked Series 4 of both Poirot and Marple. What happened to the writers that did such a fantastic job on series 1 thru 3? Series 4 of both Marple and Poirot were the worst written, filmed and edited in the series. There was absolutely no flow whatsoever to the story. I too was completely lost after the first 5 minutes. The cinematography and editing made me dizzy. This past week I watched and thoroughly enjoyed all episodes of Marple 1 thru 3. They are wonderful! I was really disappointed that Geraldine McEwan was replaced in series 4. The writers shot this series in the foot so I won't be adding them to my collection. It's a good thing I have the first three seasons of Marple (as well as Foyle's War) to fall back on! Let's hope that some major changes are made on future series if any..."
1,Christie No Doubt Rolling Over in Her Grave,"Generally thoughtful casting, lovely sets and costumes, and high production values are ruined by poor direction, unnecessary rewriting of Christie's material, over-the-top scoring, and a tendency to melodrama. Although the casting was generally quite good, McKenzie isn't a convincing Marple to me, but I can't put my finger on whether that results from bad casting, bad acting, bad direction, or simply bad taste on my part. If you haven't watched Rutherford, Dickson, or McEwan, do so before wasting time on these four disasters."
1,Why call it Christie?,"I was very disappointed in this series because I was expecting Christie's Miss Marple and found something completely different that I didn't like half as much. If the producers of this series want to write their own stories and have a different type of detective, why not just do so? Trading on the Christie name and the Miss Marple character is really a cheap trick. I especially could not understand the complete rewrite of ""Why Didn't They Ask Evans"", which was implausible and very dark. Please don't call it Christie when it's not."
1,stolen identity,"This is not Miss Marple. The cast does its best and can not be faulted, but the script, directing, editing, all a miserable mess of 21st century commercialism of a fine old genre.This is a horrible remake, and not worth the plastic its pressed on."
5,Loved them on TV,This series was on PBS and we loved it so much for its similarity to Christie's writing that we decided to watch it again.
5,Love Marple wish they'd do the show again.,Love Marple wish they'd do the show again. She is a great character and I like this show and Piorot as well as Midsomer Murders.
1,Save your money!,"These more recent adaptations are not worthy of being called stories by Dame Christie since they rarely stick to the original wonderful mysteries. They lack style, charm or intrigue. They are a mixed-up mess of some mixed-up screenwriter's idea of what mystery fans expect from the most read mystery author of all time.McKenzie is a very distant second to the wonderful Joan Hickson and McEwan doesn't even get out of the starting gate.If you want a good investment buy the sets with Joan Hickson.Better still, get the big Agatha Christie Mysteries set that includes the incomparable David Suchet as Hercule Poroit and see those two actors bring to life Dame Agatha's detectives as she herself would have wanted."
4,Humble Miss Marple,The stories are not exactly as I remember but still good series. Worth the watching. I think my mind is still expecting Martha Rutherford as Miss Marple.
3,"Not bad, but definitely not the best","Although Julia McKenzie as Miss Marple is good, after seeing Geraldine McEwan in the same role, the entire series was a bit of a let down. One of the great things about the production with Ms. McEwan was how she always managed to insinuate herself into the investigation even though the investigator was usually reluctant to involve her. With this new series, there were several occasions when there was no real explanation of why the investigator included Miss Marple. If the show had been like that from the beginning it wouldn't have mattered but the change was difficult to absorb since that was a key part of Miss Marple's personality in the first three series.."
3,"Not bad, but a bit plodding.","Agatha Christie is better read than watched. Good plots, but not good for TV production. Not as good as the Poirot mysteries."
5,Excellent resource,"This text is a fantastic resource for the practitioner new to the treatment of venous diseases. It is an indispensible tool in setting up a phlebology practice. The appendices of office practice tools (i.e.-eval forms, consents, manufacturers) was a wonderful suprise. Bravo!"
5,Concious Dream,"Finally a CD featuring electric guitar that is awesome! Has numerous songs for many age groups. I purchsed it 2 days after release and listen to it in my car on the commute to work or jam out at home. Great job, guys!"
5,Thank you,The product sold was described and delivered exactly as it was presented/described. Truly appreciated the prompt delivery of the product--thank you!
5,love this wrap!,"Just arrived and managed to put it on and get the baby in by myself!!! He fell asleep straight away and woke up after 10 mins and gave me the biggest gummiest smile and fell back to sleep. Love this wrap as he always wants to be held and cries when put down when I'm trying to look after my 2 and 3y old.... now I can just wrap him up on me and play with the other two and get my house work done! Just did the dishes, cleaned up toys and now typing this with him attached to me. Highly recommend!"
2,Not Practical.,"While yes, it is comfortable once you put it on and yes I like that baby can be put in it in various positions however, it does not make up for what a pain in the butt it is to put on and how friggin' HOT it is. Basically, it is a super long piece of fabric that requires wrapping, tucking, pulling and stretching. It requires a mirror so, forget about taking it on the go. The only way to use it is to put it on at home before you leave. The material is also HOT. I went for a walk w/ my 3 week old in it in 74 degree weather. I made it 10 minutes and turned around.....baby and I were drenched in sweat. Jersey cotton is not breatahble especially when its wrapped around you multiple times creating layers and layers. So, if you live somewhere that is warm to hot climate I DO NOT suggest wrap at all."
4,"Good, but","I have had this Moby wrap since my first child 2 years ago. It still looks new... I will say though I used it more with the first baby as she needed to be carried more (and I was less experienced as a mom). I like the Moby, but its best for warmer months when you can wrap it around yourself. In the winter it is really hard to use because its hard to get over your winter coat and there is no way to cover the baby. I have found myself using the Bjorn a lot more than the Moby since my new baby was born in November.I wish I had known about the Ergo baby, I would have just bought this instead of a Bjorn and a Moby."
3,wife hasn't used it yet...,Not sure why we bought this. I guess my wife wanted to have all the tools possible... but she hasn't used it yet other than trying it out at home. Maybe she will use it at some point.
3,"not as convenient as some other carriers, and no forward facing front position","We've used 6 different carriers now: Baby Bjorn, ERGObaby, Moby, Beco Baby Gemini, Aprica side carrier, and S.P.O.C. (simple piece of cloth).We got our Moby as a hand-me-down in good condition. I had to look up a video on YouTube to learn how to use it. At first, I only had the Moby and the Baby Bjorn, so I would resort to the support of the Moby when the Bjorn would start hurting my back. The Moby is rather complicated, enough so that my husband doesn't use it at all. Right now, we aren't really using our Moby, as our son likes to face out, and we use our wonderful Beco Baby Carrier Gemini - Metro Black for that. I do plan to use my Moby at the Renaissance Fair, so I look less modern (as I would with my other carriers)."
1,"Overpriced! not breathable, not easy to use, and not secure","Moby Wrap is just a big piece of cloth. It is not easy to wrap around baby securely.The cloth does not allow air to pass through (is it 100% cotton?), which poses a hazard.Our friend bought us BABYBJÖRN, which is breathable, easy to use, fast, and secure.BABYBJÖRN Baby Carrier Air - Gray/White, Mesh"
2,Difficult to use,This is perhaps the first item that I had to ever return because of it's uselessness. It's basically a huge piece of cloth that becomes extremely unmanageable with you trying to crawl the baby into it.I would have earned a slot on AFV if my wife shot the way we were dealing with this thing.
1,Moby Wrap,I thought this would be perfect for carrying around my newborn but it was so complicated that I have never used it. I am home alone with my child all the time and this wrap seemed to need at least two people in order to safely place baby in the wrap.It is also super heavy and rough material definately not something I would place my newborn in.I am very disappointed in this product and spent around $45 plus for it..waste of my money.
1,Good only if you hvae 4 arms and the patience of a saint!,"I bought this to travel with my 2 month old and didn't end up using it because it was ridiculous to try and wrap this thing around my body what seemed like 10x and then try to put the baby in by yourself!Unless you have someone to help you wrap your body and help you put the baby in, I wouldn't recommend this at all!!!"
5,Great product,"I wish that I had bought this item for my older kids...this is a dream come true. My daughter is 2 mths,whenever we go out she hates falling asleep in the carseat,she loves being held a certain way to sleep,I put her in the wrap and she is off to slumberland. This is a great product."
2,Buy the Baby Bjorn instead!,"I registered for this and really looked forward to getting it. I really, really wanted it to work. On those rare occasions when I can get my 6-week old daughter into properly, it does work. The problem is that since it's yards & yards of fabric that you have to re-wrap every time you use it, you never know if baby is going to be in it properly or not! I tried 10 times this morning to put my daughter in it. She was awake & fidgety, and her head kept popping out. GRR!!! I took her out, put her in the Baby Bjorn instead, and we were just fine. I might try the Moby later when she's able to hold her head up (like in ALL the pictures), but for a newborn, I do NOT recommend this product."
2,Moby wrap,"I purchased a moby thinking it would be a great way to have my baby close to me. In the end bought an ergo instead and hid the moby in the closet. It was hot to wear, I never fully felt secure that I was wearing it correctly, and was annoyed by having to re-wrap when ever I was needing to take my baby with me. Felt like I always needed the instruction book to put it on, and always needed someone to help me wrap it around. Not my favorite item."
3,Too long!,"Some people might prefer long enough baby carrier, but this is way too long. It takes some time to wrap all the carrier around the body."
2,Not too impressed,"I got this wrap for my newborn. After using an Ergo for two years, I thought I'd try something different with baby #2. I wasn't impressed with all the material, and it was confusing on hoe to use. The function was the same as my Ergo; my Ergo was just easier to use. I ended up returning this item and bought an infant insert for my other carrier instead."
5,Love the Moby,The Moby Wrap is a comfortable baby carrier that's easy to use once you've got the technique down. I highly recommend it!
2,I wanted to like this...,"...but it just didn't happen. I was never able to get a tight enough wrap, no matter what I did. I tried so many different ways but the baby never felt secure in it. The material is a really thick, high-quality jersey, but I found myself overheating every time I wore it, even when it was winter- and don't even get me started on how hot this thing was in the summer.Pros:-Really soft, available in tons of nice colors and some patterns.-Machine washable, and it washes nicely.-ummmm... that's it, really.Cons:-Hard to use.-Doesn't feel secure.-Really hot.I ended up selling mine for about half what I paid for it, and the girl who bought it ended up loving it for her very small baby, so I really do think that for this carrier is great for some people, just not for me. I ended up with a few different woven (non-stretchy) wraps and I like those much better."
3,didn't work for us,"a lot of my friends have had good luck with this carrier, but it just didn't really work for us. apparently, my baby didn't like feeling constricted. i tried different holds many times, but she was only comfortable in the wrap for about 10 min max and then would start fussing..."
3,overwhelmed by fabric!,"I purchased this sling based on all of the great reviews. It may be a great sling but I am not a fan based on the amount of fabric and the time it takes just to get the sling on. There is SO much fabric it was so cumbersome to get on, not to mention to try and carry around or put on quickly away from home."
5,One of the best,"Every mama needs this or an Ergo (or both). These wraps are wonderful and work for any body type. Safer than a sling, and there are dozens of ways to wear it which you can learn how on their dvd. Great, reliable product."
2,"Overly complicated, and uncomfortable.","The Moby Wrap was recommended to me in a parenting class and I was drawn in by the number of ways you could wrap it. Unfortunately, I found that that is where the benefits stop. It is one of those things that is good on paper, but not in practice.It is quite long and very cumbersome to wrap in even the most basic way, and you never seem to get the baby seated properly. It was not through lack of trying that I could not make it work, I was home the first 3 months of my son's life and after 2 months of trying daily, I gave up. The knot makes an uncomfortable lump, the fabric wrapping around you so many times is hot and binding, and the baby is held so close to you it makes them hot too.Plus, the price for what is just a long piece of jersey knit with a serged edge is insulting. Find a Baby Bjorn and do yourself a favor. You may only be able to use it one way, but you arent exhausted by the time you get the baby in it."
1,It's Stupid.,"I bought the Baby Bijorn which my son did not like. He may like it as he gets older, but for now, he lasts about 15 minutes in it, and then starts crying. So next I tried the Moby Wrap. I suppose it's a good idea in theory, but it's just not very practical. It takes practice to get it tied correctly, and frankly it's quite comical trying to put it on. It's so long that it drags on the floor while you're maneuvering it, and then after the baby is in it, it takes some adjusting to get it just right. What you're left with is a ton of fabric wrapped around you, and you're hoping your child is secure. I think I'll put it in my upstairs bedroom and use it to shimmy down the side of the building in case there's a fire."
2,"If you live in a warm climate, not so good.","I bought this because of the high user ratings / comments & a recommendation from my Doula. I also love the idea of wrapping him on because it seems more organic and natural.THE GOOD*Might be decent to use once the weather turns really cool (winter time).THE BAD*Too bulky:: Even with directions, I found the Moby tedious to handle and tie due to its bulk and length.*Thick material:: The material wasn't very breathable due to the thick cotton. In the S. California climate I live in, it can get pretty warm during the day and this just creates way too much heat.OVERALL*If I lived in a mostly cool/cold climate this might work for me but I don't. I put the Moby in storage and currently using (and very satisfied with) a Baby Bjorn carrier."
5,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE my moby wrap","It took a little practice to get the hang of wrapping the Moby, but it's been my baby's favorite mode of transport since she was a newborn. safe, cozy, pretty. i wish i could buy one in every color!"
2,Eh,"I could never get this thing to work. It was so confusing. My husband tried to help and it was just frustrating. It kind of worked one time, but it made my shirt all twisted and rode up in the back. I sold it."
2,Hard to use,It was easy to follow the instructions but still it was not easy to use and felt unsafe to keep my 5 month old in it. My baby struggled to stay in it and it was not very easy to get him in. I would still stay with other brands of baby carries with the straps and clips. Just feels safer with the other products.
3,To much material,"It is a good idea but needs improvement. I am 5'3 and it would take me a long time to get this wrap on. I found the material to be very hot for the baby. It was cumbersome to put on and the material would drag the ground. I also have a baby bjorn, sport, and it is amazing... quick and easy and the baby loves it."
2,"good concept, but hard to use","PROS: my baby liked the snug feel. allows me to free both hands to do other things.CONS: hard to wrap properly without someone else helping me do it. if i do it alone, the fabric gets all SHRIVELED UP like a tight rope around my shoulders and back. the product itself is very elactic/high quality though."
5,Great wrap!,"My 5 month old boy LOVES this wrap. He hated slings so I thought wearing him wasn't going to happen until I found this wrap. He absolutely loves his Moby and I am very comfortable wearing it. People always stop me to comment on how cute we look in it, too!"
5,I Love the Moby Wrap!,"The moby wrap is perfect! Its easy to put on, and puts my baby girl to sleep 85% of the time. She loves to be right there with me, and I love to be able to use my hands sometimes:) With my nieces and nephews we used to wrap with scarves, This is so much more secure and comforting!!"
4,great for front and side carries - too stretchy for back carries,"Our family loves the moby. Both my husband and I use it several times daily with our high-need son. But it's too stretchy for a safe back carry. Also, now that our son is 5 months old and squirmy, he can get out of it too easily when he wants to. If you use a wrap lots or really want a secure carrier, you might want to look for a woven wrap. Check here for more info on those, as well as suggestions for many more carries than are noted in the moby instruction booklet:[...] and[...] (Note, I don't have any affiliation with these websites)."
4,Pretty Cool,"I like the MOBY a lot but it is a bit time consuming. Definitely put it on at home before you go anywhere because the ends will trail on the ground. My little man loves it but he also tries to escape from it. He is 6 weeks and doesn't like to have his head in it so that leaves me holding his head up, not hands free. Probably will be awesome when he is doing that himself. I really like that he is wrapped to me. Seems a lot less sterile than other baby carriers. Dad likes this too. I'll need to update this review as time goes on but all said and done I'm glad I spent the money because it cut out stroller hassles, allows me to feel close to him, lightweight and comfortable for travel on a plane."
3,getting used to it,"overall I like it. It is taking lots of practice to get the wrap to the right tightness and security for me and the baby. He has fallen asleep in it a couple of times, but as a paranoid mother I am constantly worried that he will overheat or stop breathing. So I don't keep him in it for long. I think it will come in handy when we travel in the airport."
5,Great baby wrap,I have a daughter that is now 7 weeks old and I have been using this wrap since the beginning. It is comfortable and I love it for shopping and walking outside. She usually falls asleep when in the wrap. The only downside is that I can't have one in all colors!
3,Its soft and comfortable to wear.,"I bought this baby carrier when my daughter was 3 1/2 months. I had recently tried the Baby Bjorn breathable baby carrier but my daughter never liked it too tight. I decided to try a wrap instead, it was also cheaper. When I first tried it i notice it was pretty long and found out later that there is smaller ones for this brand. It took my daughter a few times to get used to it. I guess because she is not used to being confined in one place. I would recommend to used this wrap for newborns... I also notice that it wasn't complicated to wrap it. However, my baby gets really hot in this, so i must keep her in very little clothing. Overall, This product is good for newborns."
3,"Nice, cozy and warm...","Very nice fabric..beautiful color. A little difficult to get on yourself. I ordered it to use in the airport which backfired because they made me undo it and take it off...keep in mind this wrap is like 10 feet long and I am by myself! It also get really warm inside so if you live in the south like I do, then dress your baby in lighter clothing."
4,The coolest thing ever!,"We love our moby!!! At first it was very confusing.. this super long piece of fabric is supposed to hold my little girl on me?! The instructions were kind of confusing so I just got on youtube and watched how people did it and bam! It was so easy! My daughter (5 weeks) LOVES it and it's great. It allows me to get work done around the house while she's on me, and also I can shop and she sleeps so well in it.It's great!!"
2,Moby Wrap -- too much to wrap,"I bought the Moby Wrap, but I found it was too much to wrap and my crying baby doesn't have the patience for me to figure out how to wrap it. The material has to wrap around front to back, then flip over both your shoulders in a criss-cross f-f-fashion across your back, and then wrap again in front and knot it on your side (maybe not all in that order). I will try it again when she is 5 months old to see if I have figured it out by then. Until that time, I'll just use my Baby Bjorn."
3,Meh.,"The good:You can use the Moby with a newborn (of at least 8 pounds).It does a good job of holding baby cozy against you.It's warm (this can also be a negative, see below)--we put our 3 week old daughter in it when we took her to an outdoor festival. It was quite chilly and she was cozy all day.My daughter went to sleep almost immediately upon being placed in it, though I'm sure it doesn't have that magical effect for everyone.The bad:Inconvenient to use, as it's a huge strip of fabric so putting on/taking off when away from home is a huge pain in the neck. As other reviewers have noted, you can't adjust it once it's on.It's very warm-my daughter got heat rash after I carried her in it on a warm day (in the 70s).I could never figure out how to breastfeed in it. I know some women do, but I don't know how."
3,Useful but cumbersome,"When researching for a baby carrier, I looked at many traits the Moby Wrap had. I liked the fact it is worn over both shoulders and that it is adjustable. However, because it is so long, it does take practice to put on without dragging on the floor. In my house with pets, this is a nuisance if I don't want dog hair on the ends of the wrap. Regardless, I much rather prefer this type of 2-shoulder sling to carry my very long baby than a 1-shoulder sling. Not only does she stay in the Moby wrap without me having to hold her with any hands, but because of the support my back doesn't hurt. I especially like the wrap to go food shopping. Around the house however, I prefer the 1-shoulder sling since it is much easier to place the baby in and take her out; not to mention to put on and take off. Even though I have breastfed her while wearing the wrap, all the fabric makes it uncomfortable and hot."
2,Complex,I can only get the wrap one way and the baby in the wrap one way. Maybe its me but either way it was a waste of money for us :(
4,Great for my newborn!,"So many slings aren't great for young babies, their heads slide down so easily & I don't feel comfortable when my baby's face isn't visible, but the positions with this sling are great! My son is 3 weeks old and likes the cradle hold & newborn hug. He wasn't crazy about me learning to figure out how to place him at first, but now that I'm used to how to use the sling & place him in it, he is fine with it. He feels very supported. I will say though that the breastfeeding hold doesn't work great - you still have to support baby's head. I can BF just as easy with one arm without the sling. Plus it kind of bent him & I could tell he was uncomfortable. The directions are a little confusing with some of the holds. For all those who say this is too hard to put on - I don't really get that. After the 2nd time putting it on it was a cinch - quick & easy. I will say it makes my back a little sore - but much more comfortable than any of the other slings I've tried. Overall, love it!"
4,Can't wait to use it!,"My baby isn't here yet, but it's #4, and I KNOW what I'm looking for in a wrap! I've tried it on, and even secured my 3 year old in it with no problem. The material is quite long, and it seems it will drag on the ground when attempting to put it on, but I got it on with no problems, just by following the directions in the package. Can't wait to snug my new baby into it!"
3,So-so,"I ordered this because my baby was having problems with the Beco carrier we had. She fussed every time we put her in it. So I thought I would try this. Personally, I thought it was hard to get the hang of and hard to get my baby in comfortably. She started to like the Beco after awhile and I stopped using this."
2,Too Long!!,I can't even put this on!! My baby hated it and it was so huge on me. I'm 5'2 115lbs and I was taken over by all the fabric. I could see it being a wonderful product maybe for someone larger than myself but for me it was just too big. I'll give it a few more tries and see if I'm putting it on wrong or something like that
2,Not my favorite baby item,"Maybe I would have liked this more if I'd bought it when my baby was born instead of when he was 15 pounds. I went back and forth about whether I needed it and ended up buying it with intention of using while attending an event that I had to bring my son to. I didn't end up using because I couldn't figure it out. It is not as user friendly as they make it seem. For me, it's always too loose or too tight. I would love to use it more but I can't figure it out. Also, since it uses your ""whole back"" it's supposed to be more comfortable but the times I've tried it out I always get back cramps. Perhaps it's because I can't tie it right. If you're going to get one, I suggest going somewhere to try it out first (like Babies R Us) and that way you can check out other carriers too. I wish I had."
2,"Great wrap, but not for heavier babies","We bought a Moby for our 8 month old, when she outgrew another sling carrier we had. I was concerned it would be too stretchy to support her 25lbs. At first, it seemed to work out fine for us, but the more I used it with a hip carry and tried to carry her for longer walks, the Moby stretched a little too much for my liking. With the hip carry, I had to keep retying it because it stretched too much.It seems like a great product for newborns and even less heavy older babies. If yours is in the 95%+ or above for weight (ours is 8 months, 24-25lbs and 30.5 inches)I wouldn't recommend it for long-term carrying. I know that it says the Moby will support 35lbs, but it didn't work for 25lbs in our case. Moby makes a very, very expensive woven wrap that will support the weight of even heavy babies, but I'm going with Etsy. There's lots of choices for woven wraps that are $35-$45; they're beautiful and made by baby wearing mamas in the U.S. Happy baby wearing!"
2,not what you see in the picture..,"we bought this item hoping that it is more than a long piece of cloth, but it was. You have to put it together yourself by folding around yourself. It supports your back good, but I don't think our baby was so comfortable on it, especially when the baby is less than 3 months old. We have returned the item and got one of the ready to go sets. The pictures are deceiving and they don't say this is just a piece of cloth and you have to fold around yourself. Overall, we were not satisfied with the product and I think it is little pricey for being a long piece of cloth."
1,Hard to put on,"Heavy fabric, both baby and I are frustrated by the time I am ready to put him in. I get tired just wrapping the ten feet long cloth around my body!"
3,kinda difficult,I am an educated woman with a masters degree and I can't seem to get the hang of this. I can't seem to get it tight enough because in about 20 minutes it seems to be loose and I am afraid the baby will fall out. He never seems completely secure. I will keep trying I am disappointed. I seem to be in the minority so maybe you will have better luck- I guess I am missing something.
1,Only use if you are an octopus!,"I was so excited to get this wrap. My baby constantly wanted to be held and I thought this would make us both happy. I was very wrong. It arrived and when I opened it I knew we were going to have issues. It came with a very thick instruction manual and the option to watch a video online. Still, I gave it a try. Many tries. The thing is very very long. First you have to fold it in half lengthwise, then you have to drape it this way and that way, pick up and position the baby, then wrap and tie it. Perhaps if I had eight arms or someone to help me, this would have worked. However, after using it a few times, I returned it. I opted for a more traditional type carrier that I could get the baby in and out of myself...with my own TWO arms :)"
2,Ehhh..its not the best,I do believe I made a mistake buying this product! I did not think it was going to be extremely long to tie around. I didn't think to look at that when I bought it. I only bought it because the reviews said it was great and lightweight also it didnt hurt alot of others peoples backs. I really did not like it I think I will resale this. If it even is a good product to sale...anybody want it
1,Never recieved the product.,"When I ordered this product I was very excited! During check out, I left my old address on the shipment and didn't notice until a day later. I was upset! I decided to email the seller to see if there was any way they could cancel it. They replied with a ride e-mail. I understand that they can't refund a product that has already been shipped, but I did not show that it had been. I replied to the e-mail stating that I would not reccomend this company's services and recieved a string of personal attacks! Calling me unstable! I am extremely dissapointed in the lack of professionalism. I would not order from this company again. I can't believe I've been attacked over an order. And they still got paid! DO NOT order your moby from this seller."
1,Its a MUMMY WRAP,"Its horrible, I dont know why anyone would pay 40 bucks for a length of fabric you need to wrap yourself and the baby up with.Beware, if you do not do it correctly and tie a good knot, the baby will fall out."
1,Terrible product,"Even though it comes with instructions, it is way too complicated to use. I was hoping to use it around the house but you need to know some acrobatics and balancing skills to get the baby securely in this thing. Not to mention, it shrunk 2 feet after I washed it (following the instructions, mind you). Now I have to tighten it in the back versus the front. It's now destined for the donation pile. The Baby Bjorn is easier to use."
1,Moby Wrap,"Dear AmazonI have not received the item purchased. I tried to contact the hotel to see if the product had gotten there, but did not get news.Still do not receive the item ""moby wrap"" purchased.mara"
4,very comfortable,"I really love this sling. Its very comfortable and secure. My 5 month old loves it. It may get a little hot for summer time especially in Hawaii. I wish they had a smaller size for petite women. There's a lot of fabric to go around my 5'2 frame. Other than that, this sling is awesome. It doesn't hurt my back or shoulder like the babybjorn."
2,Entirely too complicated,"This was entirely too complicated use it a whopping 2 times. I would spend 20 minutes each time trying to place it and my baby correctly and still did not feel safe carrying her around in it. Conceptually it seems awesome, but way too much work than i really want to spend when there are other products that are cheaper, faster, easier, and that my baby liked more. I preferred a baby carrier instead."
1,DO NOT BUY! VERY DISAPPOINTED,I read so many good reviews on this and bought it. Very very disappointed and pissed off. The baby didn't like it. It was too uncomfortable for him. He was barely a month old. The material is sooo bad. My husband washed it and came back shrunk! I couldn't wrap it around my waist anymore and I'm not a big girl. I'm average size. I just lost $60 bucks for this crap. Better to buy a real baby carrier at BabiesRUs or something. They should make this preshrunk.
1,Not for us,"I was very excited about this modern ""rebozo."" I thought I would love it. But when it came down to it, my baby HATED it. He cried every time I attempted to put him in. I didn't particularly like it, either. It was hard to put on and I couldn't deal with wrapping so much heavy fabric around me. Once on, it was hot and overall felt like a straight jacket. For the price, I would give it a try, it might work for you as for so many people, apparently. If not, I would recommend an Ergo Baby. (But I can't comment on the newborn insert though, since I got it when my baby was already 6 months old.)"
3,Too hot for a Texas summer baby,"This was a nice idea, but with 100 degree weather at the time of use, it was way too hot for my son. Great for a cooler climate."
2,Too much too figure out,I recommend this product before your baby arrives. Trying to figure it out with a newborn is no fun. Honestly it's a huge pain to put on!! It's super long and I'm a skinny person. I also have zero patients. I also felt like I couldn't get it tight enough and didnt feel safe putting my baby in it! But that's just me and lots of people use the moby and love it. It's just not for me. I tried various products and the only thing my baby will sit in is a balboa sling! Used safely and properly of course. Good luck!!
2,Loooooong learning curve..,"My daughter is still settling down from 3 failed attempts. I am a very coordinated guy. I can figure out anything. I swear I can pack 3 car loads of groceries into one.I watched the videos then tried to get her in. Mind you she is a very quiet baby, cries only for the basics, diaper, hungry ect. First try she was upset, second she was distraught, third she was clearly pissed.If you can figure this out your a genius. God bless you and the week you took to do it.I gave it two stars because I found a wonderful use for it. I cut it up into blanket sizes and the elastic properties make them into wonderful swaddles. Heck I might just by more for that. I mean it is what 15 feet long."
3,"Good for home, not for going out","We were determined to ""wear"" our daughter as much as possible, so the Moby was a natural choice. We started using it right away when she was born (6.5 lbs) and it worked okay. We needed something flexible for different sizes - daddy is thin, mommy is not. It worked well for this; I just tied in the back, not under the baby in front. The hardest thing is adjusting it. It takes a while to get the hang of how to wrap it on, position a baby and be comfortable for more than a few minutes. It seems to stretch just enough to be loose after a few minutes, no matter what hold you use. This means the baby sags down, and then must be adjusted as soon as they have fallen asleep...no good.Now that she is 5 months, we use it around the house, but much prefer our Ergo when we are out. It is warm, like wearing a second shirt in addition to the baby's body heat, so now that we are approaching summer, I doubt I will use it much."
4,Useful and comfortable,"I bought this wrap because I had problems with wrists, so I can get some weight off my hands. It served well.The wrap is comfortable to wear and has many options how to wrap it (you can even use your own ideas). My baby really calms down in it and falls asleep deeply.The only disadvantage is that the fabric is a bit heavy, so you need to dress lighter not to overheat yourself or the baby. It's also a little too long and difficult to put on, so you either pull the end on the floor or end up being wrapped so tightly that it's impossible to put the baby down without wakening him up again."
1,Confusing,A friend recommended this to me and loved it but I had a hard time figuring out how to use it. I decided to stick with my Bjorn instead.
3,Not for us.,This is was hard for me as this was really long for me but my husband likes it better than I do. We do not use this much.
2,Too big,I think this is for larger people. It was way too much fabric. Used twice then gave away. I just got the ergobaby and it is awesome!!!!! My 15 mo loves it. Much easier and fits any body size parent
5,Love it,You have to be committed to wanting to wear your baby though. It takes a little time and practice to get it down but soon it becomes second nature. A lot of people give up and return this item before they perfect the wrap. My daughter liked facing out before she could even hold her head up and the wrap allowed her to do that. There's a cool back hold for older kids too. Check you tube for lots of options and step by step directions.I plan on using this with baby #2 but I'm a little concerned I won't have the time or free hands to tie and re-tie it with my toddler running around. I may try a pre-tied sling for breastfeeding at least.
4,"Great product, not for me...",I found it too cumbersome. I guess I didn't practice enough because I felt I had to keep readjusting it. Item arrived on time.
2,A Little Disappointing,"We were less than impressed with this product. While it's functional, it's not always the most practical carrier. If you're in public, trying to put on this EXTREMELY long piece of fabric is hard to manage and difficult to keep from dragging the ground. We wanted it for trips into the grocery store, etc. so we wouldn't have to use the car seat as our son's getting heavy and the car seat takes up a lot of room in the buggy. But to stand in the parking lot of a grocery store trying to manipulate this piece of fabric without letting it touch the ground is not easy. I guess we're just a couple of germophobes, but if something touches the ground in a parking lot, we not putting it next to our baby's face."
1,multiple yards of fabric is HOT!!!!,"Loved the product, it felt comcortable especially with baby in it. But about 10 minutes later baby was HOT and so was I. If you or you baby is hot natured then don't buy."
5,BEST baby item!,"I have this, and another wrap from a different company and I have to say that they were the best things I've gotten for my new baby. I wish I would have gotten one when my first child was born. I love that my baby's weight is distributed evenly so that even after walking around a zoo for HOURS I was not hurting, even just 4 weeks after a c-section!I also have to say that the shipping from this seller specifically was amazingly fast! I had my order in TWO days. I was thrilled!There are only two ""cons"" that I can see and one is the price, fourty dollars for what is basically a long piece of fabric is pretty steep. If you know how to sew, find out the dimensions, get some fabric and make one yourself for about 75% less money.The other is that living in a very warm climate, the fabric that the Moby wrap is made from is a little thick for comfort. The other wrap that I have (wrap n wear) is made from crinkle cotton and it's much lighter and more comfortable in the heat."
4,Hands Free,"This product is great when you don't want to bring a big stroller or travel system around and when you want to do house work and be hands free. The only thing is it's too hot for summer for me. But I do use it occasionally, I'll surely use it for cooler weather."
3,Not for hot weather!,"I purchased the Moby Wrap with my 4th child. I also own a Baby Bjorn and a Hotsling. The Moby works great for infants under 6 months to wear around the house or grocery shopping. Once my son started getting squirmy, the Moby did not seem to be able to contain him like the Baby Bjorn carrier. In addition, we recently went to Orlando to visit the theme parks with our older children. My son was in the Moby wrap and both of us where extremely hot. I would not recommend the Moby for warm outdoor weather. I am a firm believer in wearing your baby so find a carrier that works for you and your baby and keep wearing them safely!"
3,"Great, if you can figure it out","I did not realize this was literally one ginormous piece of fabric. While it is pretty comfortable once I finally get it on, and very nice for baby to snuggle in, it's very difficult to get right. I picked this to wear baby around the house, to sooth him when he's fussy, so having a product that takes fifteen minutes to assemble doesn't really work for me. Since most of the configurations are exactly the same wrap pattern, I don't understand why it isn't just sewn that way.I'm sure other people can get it on faster, but for me, I prefer a Mei Tai like the Kozy Carrier. If you have a masters in fabric folding, get this. Otherwise, I suggest the Maya wrap or a Mei Tai carrier."
5,Can't say enough good things about the Moby !,An essential pice of baby equipment and the most comfortable of all the carriers I have tried. I've used mine with my DD since birth and I now give them as shower gifts because they are so terrific.
3,Should I have tried the sleepy wrap?,"I purchased this wrap and have liked using it for the most part. It's relatively easy to use, although there are copious amounts of fabric. I like it's packability and universal usability (my husband is much larger than I am and can also use it). That makes it more portable than the also universal baby bjorn. It is comfortable during long term use. It did seem a bit warm for the summer months, even for indoor use. I also wonder if I should have gotten the sleepy wrap instead. It is the same price, but people who are familiar with both wraps seem to prefer the sleepy wrap. I think the sleepy wrap is a little more elastic which seems like a good thing. When I use the moby wrap there's extra loose fabric here and there which is kinda annoying."
3,Not for a hot climate,"At first I loved the Moby wrap and thought it would be great to carry my newborn son in. I used it in the early summer in southern CA. This proved to not be such a great idea. He was fine at first, but then he would get so hot and sweaty that he would spit up. I tried it a month later thinking maybe it was a fluke thing and it happend again. I would highly recommend a carrier that is more breathable and has better air flow."
3,Great carrier,"I love this carrier and so does my baby. I have used many carriers over the years with four children and for comfort, versatillity, ease of use and portability you cannot beat this one. Having said that I can't use it much right now because of the heat. It is VERY hot for both me and baby even in the house so outdoors in 100 degree heat is OUT of the question. I plan to pick up when the weather is cooler though because we are both so comfortable in it."
5,Magic!,"This product has been a life saver for those times when baby is fussy and you need to get stuff done. I'm able to pop him in the Moby and then wash the dishes, or vaccuum, or whatever. I've even been able to prepare and cook dinner in it! He calms down almost instantaneously once in the Moby and is comfortable hanging out for an hour or more.The wrap washes easily in the washing machine. Mine did shrink a little after washing, but was still long enough to be able to use it with no problems."
4,Really nice fabric,"The Pacific color is gorgeous! and the wrap works as advertised but my little guy only likes it for short periods of time and won't fall asleep in it so it hasn't worked out as well as I had hoped. Still, it is a quality made product and think it is worth a try... and definitely felt safer than any of the other slings I tried in the stores."
3,Decent Product,"I read rave reviews about this product and I have friends who love their mobys. I do like mine however I've found it's hard to make tight enough on my own. Also, it tends to fall off my shoulders pretty often so I always have to have a hand on my baby for safety. Maybe my shoulders aren't broad enough for this product...My husband has worn it and doesn't have the same shoulder problem. I have twins and my daughter loves being it because she likes being held kangaroo style. My son on the other hand cries when I put him in it. If I were to do it again I don't think I'd buy this product. I'd look into other similar styles and brands."
1,Oh my gosh - this thing is way too confusing,"Ok, I am a sleep deprived new mother, this thing took having another girlfriend come over to help me put it on, watching ayoutube video and then it was still overwhelming...forget it! I went with a simple sling that I love."
5,Instant Relaxation for Colic Baby,"Quick and Easy to put on. I love this product and recommend it to all my friends, especially a baby with Colic or just don't want to be put down. My son was 2 weeks old when he started Colic. It was definitly hard to get house work done with him always wanting to be held. My first time I put it on, my son went from fussing/crying to an instant sleep in the Moby in just a few minutes being in it. My son is 2 months now and I have definitly notice I am not using it as much as I had to in the beginning. I still use it at least a few times out of the week. Couldn't live without it. Happy baby makes a happy mom."
2,Not for petite women!,"I'm 4'10'' and the Moby Wrap swallowed me up! I even got the ""shorter"" version which still ended up being too big. I tried wearing it several times but I felt like I was wrapping myself in a sheet. I ended up getting a Becco Butterfly which was a lot more money but worked better with my body type."
2,Did not work for me,"I really wanted to like this wrap. But it was a pain to get in and out of and the fabric dragged on the ground. Just not cool in dirty parking lots. I found myself constantly fiddling with it since it didn't seem like it was on right, or the baby looked like she was in crooked, or her head needed support, etc. It was also tough on my back and the baby was only 7#. I used it a few times and ended up with a Baby Bjorn, which was much easier to use."
2,Slips and slides_Baby didn't feel secure,"We chose the Moby Wrap and the Baby Bjorn before the birth of our son. Our pediatrician advised us not to use either really until our baby could hold his neck up. The exception was if we used the Moby wrap in an infant style hold.After using the Moby, I would not recommend it for three reasons:1. Slips and comes undone if you are moving much or on the go. This means you are constantly adjusting and readjusting and worrying if your child is going to slip and fall out of the wrap.2. Awkward to put on and take off.3. Baby's head constantly slips down under the folds and you worry about your baby being able to get enough air.When our son could hold his head up, we started using the Baby Bjorn and never looked back."
3,Moby wrap,"I liked the Moby wrap; the few times I used it (I recently lost it) it was comfortable, easy to adjust. The only drawback is that it required 2 people (myself and someone else) to put my daughter in. And it was a bit on the bulky side."
5,Best baby carrier on the market!,"My husband and I both LOVED the moby wrap. I is now my favorite shower gift. I have a very bad back and the moby was (my child is now 4 easy on my back. I like the ergo carrier when my baby got too big for the moby but I returned the ergo infant insert. I felt it just didn't work for a small infant. Plus, the moby snuggles your baby right up to your chest and what a wonderful feeling! Can't recommend it highly enough!"
4,Very convenient,"I bought this wrap to help get some back support while carrying baby. it was pretty good! the only caveat is my baby doesnt want to stay in the carrier for long.and i guess u can only use this at home, because if you are outside and want to take baby out, you have to unwrap the whole thing, a cumbersome process in the middle of a road."
5,Great Product!!!,I got this wrap after a friend told me how great it was. It has a great price and is a lot more comfortable for the baby and me than the other carriers.
5,GREAT WRAP,"I have a toddler & a nb that I carry in the Moby all the time! It is very comfortable, easy to put on, & I feel like the baby is secure, all the while I can manage my toddler easily! I can even pick my toddler up while the baby is in the wrap...and the baby loves it!! It looks a little intimidating at first, but once you put it on, it doesn't get any better than that!!"
3,Can't rate it... it was a gift,I will have to wait several weeks before the person who received this will be able to use it. I just hope it works out for her.
2,Moby Wrap,Bought this about two years ago. It was crap. I didn't like it at all. I did not feel safe having my baby in this thing at all! Ended up buying a different carrier by Evenflo . . . a front to back carrier it was great and half the price :)
3,moby wrap,"I like the moby wrap. It is easy to put on, however there is alot of fabric so my baby doesn't like it on warm days. Even if she is only in a onesie it is too warm."
1,not as great as I thought it would be,"This was the highest customer rated wrap on Amazon so I bought one. I found it difficult to figure out, not as comfortable as I thought it would be, and too time consuming to get in and out of. I think it might be good if you aren't looking for anything quick and you have someone help you put it on the first few times. A one piece carrier that just snaps into place like the Ergo or Baby Bjorn seems to be easier."
2,Giant Sheet,"I guess I should've read the description more thoroughly, but I purchased this product by looking at the photo alone assuming it was an easy to use front carrier for a baby. I was disappointed when I got the product only to discover I could've used my king size flat sheet for nothing instead of this piece of fabric for $40. If you have time to practice the various techniques, you may like this product. But if you're like me, and you don't have time to practice & want to use it right away, you'd be better off with the Baby Bjorn or something similar. Seriously, I think a flat sheet could do the same thing as this product. Very disappointing for the price."
3,We like the moby,"Our baby likes the moby, it keeps her close and calms her. It also makes errands & chores easy because your hands are free. The upright position also helps her colic. Contrary to how it may look it's actually easy to put on.I would've rated it higher but there are a few cons..Cons:It's hot in the summer.My back starts to get a little tired after wearing for more than an hour. Once she gets heavier we may have to look into another option with more back support.It's hard to put her in it if I'm by myself."
3,Not so quick and easy...,"I originally had a peanut shell baby sling but I gained more weight with this second pregnancy and the size I had wasn't comfortable anymore. So I purchased this product because it didn't have as much of a sizing issue for me. It is very comfortable. Baby liked it enough. But the practicality of it, for me, wasn't going to work. I felt like I was basically wrapping myself in a sheet. Granted, it's a wrap and not a sling. If I wanted something to wear my baby all day while I did housework, this would be ideal. But I want something I can throw on quickly before I go into the grocery store and this isn't it."
5,"tricky at first, a breeze at second...","yes, it's more fabric than you can imagine (but manageable!), and it takes practice but my baby is so content in this wrap that I wear it around the house regularly.**TIP: When going out, wear the wrap before you get into the car. That way when you get to your destination, all you have to do is tuck Baby into place. Trust me, it sure beats struggling to tie a wrap in a parking lot or if you're caught in yucky weather."
1,Too complicated,"After hearing everyone rave about how great it was, I bought one of these while I was pregnant. Even then, I found it way too complicated. I read the book, watched all the videos, had people help me. I loved the idea of the Moby Wrap, but it was too much fabric and took too long to put on. I ended up getting an Ergo, and could not be happier. I can put my baby in the Ergo in a snap and it feels much sturdier than the Moby did. Wish I could say I liked it, but it just wasn't for me."
5,Must have,"I LOVE this carrier & so does my 2 month old. We bought this when she was 6 weeks old and I regret waiting so long! It is incredibly comfortable for both of us. I also have the bjorn which I hate. I thought the wrapping part would be daunting but there are multiple ways to wrap it and the baby loves it. She sleeps, hangs out... It's amazing and I have my hands free!! Perfect for a baby who wants to be held all of the time and affordable.. Washable... Etc etc! It is a must have and I regret not having it for the first 7 weeks. U can nurse in it... Though I have yet to try. U can wear your baby while giving them skin to skin contact. It's quite soothing. Don't look any further... Get a moby!"
1,I hate the Moby Wrap,The Moby wrap is just a long piece of fabric with instrucions on how to wrap it around yourself and baby.Try to do that with a squirming cranky child. It's next to impossible.
5,So cozy! the best one I've tried!!,I have a bjorn and a maya wrap and a maya tie and I've tried a few others and they just weren't as secure as the moby. I found with the bjorn my baby flopped around and I couldn't bend down or do any house cleaning with out disturbing her...not only that but she stuck out so far I couldn't read or look at anything down in front of me I would just get a kink in my neck. The moby wrap secures her so tightly to me that it's like swaddling. I can scrapbook and do housecleaning and she doesn't even move. Plus you can put her in so many possitions and breastfeed no problem!! It is allot of fabric and has allot of steps but like it says in the directions it only takes a few tries and you'll have the hang of it. Definately a must have for a fussy baby!!
3,Too much fabric,"There's too much fabric to wrap around, it gets hot during the summer with all that fabric. If you are outside and you want to wrap it, it's so long that it drags over the floor and gets dirty. I wouldn't rate it high on the ease of use, and also, since you have to tie the end, the knot comes lose after a while. I didnt use it more than a few times only. You are better off saving that money and spend it towards an ergo baby or one of those other backpacks. Or get a sling that you don't have to wrap around so much."
5,Comfort and Relief,"This Product is by far the best soft carrier. It relives pressure off of my back and evens out my sons weight perfectly. The best part is I can continue to do household activities like vacuuming and computer work while my son is sleeping. The closeness that the moby wrap brings is great comfort to me and probably my son as well. He also can probably hear my heart beat which is also comforting. I've used it since he was just days old and he is now 9 months and still enjoys it. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for comfort, back relief, loves snuggling your little one, and also enjoys getting a little work done if your little one does not like to be put down all the time. Enjoy!!"
5,smart buy,"Moby is a must have. It is comfortable above all, and my baby absolutely loves it. She is almost two months and I got it when she was about four weeks. Because the baby is held so tight and snug it simulates being in the womb for baby and most of the time within minutes she is fast asleep. In addition, because it is so comfortable and the weight is distributed so evenly I can keep it on with her in it for a very long time (this is essential for me because I suffer from back problems, yet wearing the moby with baby in it does not affect my back at all). Lastly, do not be intimidated by wrapping it. I watched a few videos on the internet before I got the Moby and then used the step by step instructions from the included book and now wrapping my baby is easier than ever and it didn't take long to learn."
4,Great for newborns but you will need to buy another carrier later on,"This wrap is wonderfully soft like tee shirt fabric, which makes it the perfect solution for carrying very small babies. It's also great for skin to skin contact as there is enough fabric to cover your whole torso (probably wouldn't go out in public like this, but fine for home). It has a very sleek profile so you can easily put your coat on while wearing baby. However, once baby hits the 10lb mark, the fabric is too stretchy such that baby will start to sag more and more. At this point, I switched to an Ergo, which we love! Plan to use Moby again for future newborn."
2,Baby Didn't Like It & Confusing,"With all of those wonderful reviews, my wife bought the wrap for our cranky 7-week old baby. Unfortunately, we returned it right away. The procedure to wrap and unwrap is a bit complicated and your baby needs to be pretty comfortable just ""hanging out"" while you hold him/her and spin the fabric around you. Speaking of which the product is literally just a long roll of fabric, cut to the proper dimensions of course and made from really soft material, but their is no magic happening here. Unfortunately we ended up returning this product after two days of failed attempts to really get the wrap snug and the baby didn't really enjoy being in any of the positions suggested in the manual. A bit disappointed because the baby does enjoy being in ""standard"" carriers with buckles and clamps."
2,Baby hates this.,"It could just be my little one, and you may have better luck, but I wish I hadn't wasted the money on this. I tried it several different times during her first month of life. The ""cradle hold"" she cried in and I could never get her to the correct position so that her chin wasn't on her chest. The other hold, the ""newborn hug hold"" she would tolerate, but only if her head was out, so I'd end up supporting her head with one hand, so I wasn't totally hands free. Now I'm stuck with and over-priced long piece of fabric. Maybe we'll try it again later when she has head control, but I ordered the Ergo today and have a feeling she and I are going to love it!Another thing to think about: the fabric drags the floor when you are putting it on. Not an issue in your own home, but when you are out....ewww."
3,Not Sure It's For Everyone,"I am 5'6"" and weighed 230 pounds at three months postpartum when I ordered this wrap. I tried it with my baby and after all the wrapping there was barely enough material left at the end to tie. I don't have a large chest but was still sporting a postpartum belly, however, I don't think that made much of a difference. I didn't like that and the fact that there was really no give. I like the idea of this wrap and even though I wasn't happy with the material, my baby felt more secure in this wrap than any other carrier I've tried (Maya, Bjorn, Hotsling, Peanut). I think I will try the Sleepy Baby Wrap which is stretchier."
4,Easy to use and convenient,I just got this wrap last week. The directions for the newborn hug hold (only carry we've tried so far) are easy to understand. I looked at a few youtube videos to make sure I was doing it right though. My six week old is very content in the wrap and I feel like he is safe and secure. I was able to wash dishes and clean up the kitchen with him in the wrap. I definitely say this is a great purchase. I'm looking forward to the other holds as he gains the neck control needed for them.
2,Not for preemies,"I bought this wrap because the description said it was good for any size baby up to 35 pounds, including preemies. Well, it arrived yesterday, and the directions that come with it say to wait until the baby is 8 pounds. I'm very disappointed."
2,not the best baby carrier,"I was excited to get my Moby Wrap, but have been disappointed with it. When you are out and about, the last thing you want is to have to put that stinkin thing on because the fabric is so long, it drags on the floor as you put it on. Once on, it begins to ride up my torso, so I'm constantly pulling the wrap down. It really only works when your baby faces your chest, however, my daughter dislikes that position. I'm gonna try a Bjorn, which is what I should have just gotten to begin with."
1,Hate it,"I got one of these as a gift and was excited to use it...until I tried to use it. I have followed the instructions, watched videos etc and I despise the Moby Wrap. It is awkward to fold (or even to bunch up) awkward/annoying to put on and my baby HATES it. Also, I overheat even when it's 65F outside while wearing it. Once it's on, I can't wait to take it OFF.I'm going to save up for an Ergo carrier, fits my lifestyle MUCH better than the Moby."
2,Not for short or petite wearers!,"My son is 15 months old and 27 pounds. I am 5'1"" and 110 pounds. This carrier is not for us. I found the wrap to be too long and bulky. This is a definite return."
2,Takes to long to put on properly.,"I am college educated but when it came to this wrap I felt pretty dumb. It would take me forever to put on just right. It was either to tight or to loose. With a crying baby and needing to get something done, this just was not the wrap for me. I used it maybe twice. I heard great things about this wrap, but sadly it just wasn't the one for me."
1,This thing sucks.,My newborn hates it and so do I. I should have just gone with the bjorn carrier. Who has time for all the folding and tying? And after following both the instructions and the YouTube video my baby did not feel secure at all. I gave it a few tries. I give up!
4,Good Baby carrier,"I like the Moby wrap, but I know it can be confusing to put on. My son is 2.5 months and I still don't tie it correctly sometimes. He liked it a lot when he was 2 weeks old, but then hated it until about 8 weeks. I'm not sure if I was tying it too tightly, or what his problem was, but we finally are making it work most of the time. However, he's about 15 lbs now and is starting to get to heavy for it. I can support him just fine, but if I don't tie it tight enough in the beginning he starts to sag. But I have to be careful with how tightly I tie it, because otherwise he'll complain when I first put him in.It's great for walks - it puts him to sleep about 5-10 min into our walk. I feel like he's secure it in. I just wish I could use it for a longer time. I'm sure it'll work great for my next child, now that I know what I'm doing."
3,Great for those who love the arms,"Overall product good, 2 month old is in moby and we start to walk and they are napping away. Excellent for distributing weight so that you wont be tired. ONLY BACKDRAW it wraps around your body so with baby body heat and yours when your walking you get really really HOT. I would love to use during summer time but with the thick cotton wrapped around and babies heat I dont know maybe during the late afternoon or evening. Either way good close body carrier."
2,Not very practical...,"I really wanted to like this product. Maybe I didn't try it enough or give it enough effort, but it was very frustrating to figure out how to tie it and even when I got it I didn't like it.I tried to use this on a vacation where we did a lot of walking. I am 5'2 and it was just way to much fabric, and in the heat of florida it was a torture to wear. I ended up using a stroller 90% of the time and I really didn't want to.A few months later when my son went through a phase where he didn't want to be put down, I tried using this again around the house and It just wasn't secure. My son is a pretty big baby and it just was not comfortable."
3,Good but not for all babies,I finally got my baby to use this wrap now that she's 8 weeks old and even then for just 15 minutes. She moves a lot in general and she also likes to look out into the world not at my chest so with that in mind this isn't ideal for her. I bought it while pregnant thinking it was a great concept but now I see I should have waited to see my baby's temperament. If you're pregnant and considering this item this is my best advise to you to wait and see how your baby is and what s/he will end up liking.One thing I noticed though is that it takes a few minutes to get this on and several tries to master it so if you're running to he store quickly and want to carry your baby this won't speed up the process.As well since the fabric is so long when you wrap it around you it really doesn't look that great. Not like the picture at all where she actually looks stylish.
2,Not my favority baby holder,"This worked pretty well when my baby was a newborn because he didn't mind facing towards me, but even then he would get tired of the wrap and scream out in protest to get out of it pretty quickly. I'm wondering if he got too hot. I got annoyed with having to undo the whole thing after I only got about 15 minutes of wear time out of it, so I really didn't use it much. Plus, we have 4 dogs and 3 cats, so there is always some animal hair on the ground that the wrap picks up during the wrapping process. Now that my baby is 4 months old and only wants to face forwards or looking over my shoulder when being held so that he can see what is going on, the only option is the ""Lotus"" wrap, which is awkward to get just right. I hate feeling like I am just cramming my baby's legs into the front flap like a little pretzel and expecting his contorted little legs to take some of his weight. I am a physical therapist and therefore very cognizant of joint development."
5,Wonderful!,"We bought a Moby Wrap for our son, when he was two weeks old. It was amazing. Once we got over the learning curve of how to put it on, we barely took it off for months. I even slept with it on a few times. It is soft and durable and washable. Our son really needed the extra snuggles and HATED being put down. This awesome invention saved my sanity several times during those first rough months. A mom and baby could even nurse discreetly with the Moby, if they were already successful nursers (we weren't). I would put the Moby on, pack up the baby for grocery shopping, and then tuck him into it once we got to the store. I could do laundry or make food with my free hands, pausing now and then to reassuringly pat my baby. It was great. We've bought more as gifts for others.We also had a baby bjorn (also great, with more structure but less versatility) and a baby sling (which did not work for us). Those are long gone, but we're saving our Moby for the next baby..."
3,OK for young babies--not older,"HI, I really think the Moby Wrap could be better made. The material is a little too flimsy for an older baby. It will work better for babies 0-6 months old. My baby is over 6 months old now and it just does not hold her up on me very well--so I really don't plan to use it anymore until I have a smaller baby again. I think I need something that will support her and my back better."
3,Tricky,I have not been successful at figuring out how this wrap works. I got it a while ago and it is just too much fabric and wrapping for my needs. I needed something quick and more user friendly I know some people that are successful at it so maybe it's just me but it just didn't work out. Great idea though. I am going to borrow my friends K'Tan and see if that works better for me.
1,"Too difficult to use, waste of money","I decided to buy the Moby wrap after reading all the great reviews. It must be great, right? Wrong! As soon as I unrolled it I knew I was in trouble! The directios aren't the easiest to follow, and it's hard to manage over 8 feet of fabric. By the time I managed to properly put on the wrap and then wrangle my 6-week old daughter into it, she was screaming. Over the course of the day, I tried several different holds with the wrap (some I never did figure out how to do, and I have a college degree so it's not my lack of intelligence). Each time my daughter was crying hysterically by the time I got her in. I pulled my Baby Bjorn out and she loves it. I'd save my money and buy a simple, easy to use carrier like Baby Bjorn. Moby wrap is going back today!"
1,Not so easy to nurse in! Just a piece of material!,"I got this wrap because my baby is a frequent nurser and need to be able to have my hands free sometimes. I've tried nursing her in this wrap over and over and I still have to hold her head up to me or else she can't reach it. I think this product needs to come with better instructions. I have looked all over the web for more instructions on this but nothing helps.Also, I think this product is a bit too pricey for just buying a piece of material~ because thats all that it is!! If you are on a tight budget like me, learn how to MAKE YOUR OWN. As you will save a ton of money on this!! Don't do what I did and buy a basic piece of material for [...] bucks!!!"
5,The Best $40 I've Spent!,"I have a lot of back pain and tried mant different types of carriers that just weren't comfortable. The Moby wrap is easy and low maintainance. It can fit all shapes and sizes, accomodates many positions for the baby and does not hurt my back in the slightest. This is one of those items you won't find at a consignment shop or yard sale. Once you've used it and get to where you no longer need it, you give it to another mom to enjoy. I wish I had known about this with my previous two children. It's the best $40 I've spent!!"
5,Moby Wrap,"I absolutely love this product. After recently having my 4th child I finally found a carrier that works! Every other carrier (maya wrap, baby bijorn) hurt my shoulders and back. I can wear this wrap for a LONG time and feel great. I also love the diversity of wearing your baby different ways. I can wear my 2 1/2 year old who weighs 33 lbs. on my back and it's very comfortable. I found it very easy to learn how to put it on, and now I can put it on fast."
4,Moby Wrap Review,"I thought it was great and, with practice, easy to use. It has perfect support for my newborn's head and neck unlike other hi tech carriers."
2,Just didn't work for me.,"This is another item I was so excited to get, from the reviews, and from the different ways you can carry your baby that it provides.However, once I received it and started trying to use it, it's just a mess.I read the instructions over and over and watched You Tube.I have everything correct, but once I had the baby in it, he always looked like he's getting smothered.So I don't know what I'm doing wrong and I'm too sleep deprived to investigate.The very few times I tried to use it,a) My baby would cry more because he's doesn't like his arms and legs constricted (I know, not really Moby's fault)b) Once, I was standing and all of a sudden his head just lunged forward and almost hit the corner of the table! Good thing I caught it. And this happened even when the panels were high above his head.So I don't know.I probably shouldn't be bashing it as I plan to sell it. But hey..."
2,"Like the moby, hate the color!","I thought this ""Pacific"" was more of a blue color, but it's more of a dark teal green. Not happy but didn't want the hassle of an exchange. The reviews are true... it looks intimidating at first, but then you get the hang of it. Of course, it's basically just one long strip of stretchy fabric!"
2,Mom of a 3 month old,"This comes with good easy to follow directions on how to use, but if you are overweight it does not quite fit."
3,Moby wrap,"I heard great things about the Moby Wrap. I love the concept of being hands free, however, the product is a bit pricey, the material feels heavy once it's on and on hot days it's too much to have on (so probably better for winter born babies), compared to the baby bejourn, I perfer the bejourn."
3,Moby shrank when washed,"After the first wash the carrier shrank so much I am no longer able to tie it in the front. I can still tie it in the back, but when I sit down the knot in my back is uncomfortable.My newborn likes being in the moby, but he gets very hot. If it was wintertime or you lived somewhere cold this would be beneficial. I live in the desert and it is not desirable."
4,Versatile & comfortable but hot for the summer,"I have Bjorn Air and Bjorn Active carriers and this wrap is definitely more comfortable for me. My husband won't use the Moby though. I like that the Moby is versatile and that the weight is distributed evenly across my shoulders and back. I don't like how thick and heavy the cotton fabric is. It's way too hot for summer. I wish I would've gotten a lighter color and maybe that would help with the heat. I began using this wrap when our baby was 2 weeks old. She likes the hug hold and I tuck her head in one side. It takes some practice tying the wrap so don't give up after the first try. 4 stars for comfort and versatility. 1 star off for thick, heavy fabric, which I guess will be a plus in the colder months."
3,Not exactly what I was looking for...,"I am glad to have the Moby Wrap for around the house. I sometimes wear it like to dinner where I know we are going to be seated the entire time but I want to have my hands free. I don't trust the Wrap to provide enough head support for my 13 lbs, 24 in- 3 month old so I wouldn't wear it to the grocery store yet. Maybe when he can Hold his head up more regularly then I will. For now, on big errands or shopping trips, we use the Baby Bijorn. It is stronger and keeps his little unbalanced head in place."
2,Too complicated,"I was looking forward to carrying my baby in this ergonomic carrier, but it was way too complicated. The wrap is very long about 5 or 6 feet so if your a thin person it's a lot of material. It would take about 3-5 minutes to put on, and if your baby is crying, that's an eternity! I could never get my baby in it in less than 2 minutes, again too complicated to slip a squirming baby in to this. Once in it, I never felt that he was secure, I always had to keep one hand on him, which defies the purpose of the thing to begin with. Then if he fell asleep in it, I could never get him out of it without waking him. I only used it half a dozen times and finally gave it up."
2,too much fabric!,"I spent a lot of time trying to decide on what carrier I wanted to use for when my son was born. I decided on this one mainly because it was cheaper than another style I was looking at yet it was still considered ""safe"" for baby (meaning: no problems with baby's hips when used correctly). I used this all of maybe 6 times. There is a lot fabric, it can be cumbersome. It's also hot and my son who weighed 8 lb 12 oz at birth never could fit comfortably in it. It was probably a user error but I never could get him adjusted correctly. It was either too loose and he would slide down or too tight. He did not enjoy this wrap and if he would let me carry him in it, he could take it for about an hour and no more than that. The idea of this is great, just not for us. I have since given it away to someone who loves Moby wraps. I have decided I am going to try a sling now to see how we fare."
2,Disappointed,"This wrap looks great but I unfortunately can't get the hang of it. I have a difficult time getting it on tight enough so that my baby girl is in securely. I get it on and when she is in it feels good but she ends up slanting to the side hanging diagonaly. I still have to use my hands to support her bottom just for my peace of mind. Therefore, I regret purchasing it. I feel I should have gone with a sling or other carrier. I would love any suggestions..."
1,Dislike,"Definitely not worth the money. It was hot, my son hated it, I never felt truly comfortable in it and always felt like he would slip right out. When I did wear it for more than 15 minutes my lower back started to ache."
5,Working relationship,"Patten writes a strong book on the why, how and who to international relationship and the importance of working together for the greater good. The author shows the importance of the up and coming Asia and south East Asia countries and their influence on relationships and trust. A very good and timely book, a must read for those who want to understand positions of countries in the world today and the future."
1,Music Not On CD,"Owned this on vinyl prior. Great H&O sound. Everything about the order was great, except some other music was on the CD. Amazon is refunding the order."
4,very under appreciated work,"I always loved this album although this is definitety a forgotten one. Why? It is not for lack of quality songs b/c there is plenty of good stuff here.Probably b/c this album rocked a bit harder than the others and maybe confused their fan base. It has a great supporting cast of musicians you would never expect including members of Cheap Trick. It also is heavily Todd Rundgren influenced and it sounds like Todd!""It's a Laugh"" and ""I don't want to lose you"" are typcial H&O; numbers and should be included on the normal compilations. ""Pleasure Beach"" ""Alley Cats"" and ""Blame on Me"" are hard rockers.If you are a real fan of this band you will know that live, they are a hard rocking band. This album represents the live H& O.The only problem with this cd is that when I got mine (about 6-8 years ago) the qulaity of the recording was not as good as it should be. It was not bad but not what you should expect off of a cd."
5,It's a keeper,"The first H&O album I ever bought and ranks with Voices as one of my favorites. This was also the first tour I saw. I saw Daryl and John at Western Carolina University. What a rockin show. This was a great concert album, all but overlooked now. Too bad, some of these songs knock you over live. Alley Katz and Pleasure Beach both need to be heard live to be truly appreciated. This album is the one I use when people try to lump Daryl and John into ""that soft rock 80's duo"". Yeah right. If all you know is the 80's you don't know Hall and Oates. Buy this while you can. RCA seems to be letting the CD's slip out of print again."
5,Overlooked Masterpiece,"This recording, although less of a commercial success than most of their records, reflects some of the finest writing and musicianship the duo has ever put together. With terrific guest appearances from Todd Rundgren, Robert Fripp, and others, you owe it to yourself to have this one in your collection."
4,Very good album........,"Some (later) Hall & Oates albums sound like a series of singles (with the odd track that just doesn't sound like it could be a single at all). This album is less like that - it has a series of very good songs that wouldn't jump out as chart material in their own right - but which collectively make an excellent Hall & Oates album. If you are a fan, you will enjoy this. If you know the band through their chart singles, this one may not appeal so much. But it is well produced and captures this duo fully into their White Philly Soul signature sound."
5,Commercial flop=critical success,"This is the Hall & Oates album I can still listen to and not get tired of hearing. ""It's a laugh"" is a great song to sing along with with some nice sax in the background. ""Serious music"" and ""Melody for a memory"" show H&O could rock when they wanted to get away from R&B. You can see the sky starting to clear after a thunderstorm when you play ""August Day"". It's a simple song, but it sounds more like poetry than a song."
2,seconf wedding Blues,"I gave this book two stars because it did offer proper ettiquette. However, the author seemed to focus more on what the second time bride could NOT do. I was hoping for postive help and possibly suggestions on how to handle second wedding issues. Instead, I found the same attitudes and connotations so many people have, who obviously haven't experienced either the lose of a mate or divorce. I wouldn't recommend this book unless you're ready for a ""dressing down""."
1,Cream Anthems - mixed by Tall Paul and Seb Fontaine,not too impressed with this effort $60nz probably wont listen to it a second time should have gone to the pub instead
4,if you are about to build a boat,"The book really contains everything you need to know on the subject and is regarded, rightfully so, as the standard reference. However, I must add, for a third edition, the print really lacks quality. Poor quality black and white photographs, and no real project or plans inside. I thought color printing was common these days..."
3,"Good book, but a little less than I expected","These Jane's books are a great value when bought at $20-30 when the sell for hundreds of dollars normally. They have a wide variety of subjects and entries within each one and are still quite useful even if a couple years old.That said, this particular title was a little thinner than most of the other Jane's encyclopedias. Also, I was expecting some entries on weapons and similar equipment, but this book mostly just focuses on clothing, armor, holsters/weapon slings, belts/load bearing equipments/backpacks, and similar items, so this was a little bit of a dissappointment for me."
3,Poor kids' travel information,"Too much information is not updated (nor were the index pages checked)! There were no talking camels at Luxor. There was no Pink Pony Cafe at Circus, Circus. There was no desert storm at the souvenir store at Showcase Mall. There was no Trojan Horse and no FAO Schwarz store at Caesar's Palace. The smoke at Circus, Circus was so bad we could not use the midway or several of the restaurants.Children have short attention spans and tire easily. With that in mind, it would have been helpful to know the location of attractions inside the huge hotel/casino complexes. Some complexes have few bathrooms or those that are not easily spotted.Have these editors really traveled with children?"
2,Very Poor Directions,"Although there is a good variety of trails in this book, I got lost every time I used it. The directions were not unclear- they were completely wrong. The book was written in 1995 so maybe some of the roads have changed, but there has to be a more reliable book out there. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
5,Teleliteracy by Bianculli,"The author explains the role of television in our modern society.A main thesis of the work is that the TV provides informationwhich is too important to ignore. The author explains how theTV has created a global village of local, national and international news. In addition, the television plays classicmovies, shows for children and the daily soap operas. Importantcomedy shows provide entertainment for millions of viewers.The book explains that our television is a necessary part of modern society. It entertains, informs and enlightens in waysthat other media simply cannot replicate. This book is a goodvalue for the price charged. It has aconsiderable constituency in the media and the general public."
3,Hunter's Oath,"I couldn't put this book down! The characters were lifelike, I felt like I got to know them and the story was just great in its creativity. West has an amazing eye for detail. However, the reason I only decided it was worth 3 stars, was because West's editor, apparently, doensn't have an eye for detail. Half of the time, there would be a description of a character or scene without an explanation of what was actually happening. It's not the author's fault -- an extensive read-through would have solved this problem. (Also, I didn't realize it had a sequel and was panicked when it just ended without really ending!) Even so, if you're interested in fantasy, I'd reccommend this book."
1,very mediocre,"I picked this up because it looked like it was a new angle for a fantasy novel. However, the first time I tried to read it I never got past chapter three because it lacked depth, and the continually changing viewpoint made it tedious to read. I picked it up again last week however, and slogged my way through the entire thing.I was unable to reach any rapport with the characters except possibly for Evayne, and her role mostly raises questions. All of the other characters are two-dimensional and indecipherable.The book raises lots of questions it doesn't answer, particularly with regard to the Hunter/Huntbrother relationship and the customs and conventions of their homeland. Another major question mark is Evayne and her role. She promises to bring interest and empathy into the novel, but doesn't live up to that promise.I do not recommend this book unless you want to fail to enjoy empathy with under-developed characters in a circular plot that goes nowhere and ends in a cliffhanger."
5,Easy,The process was a snap. Batteries came new in box just as stated. Couldnt be happy with how it worked out.
4,"A ""must have"" book","Written as a paper for the US Army's Command and General Staff School, this little book gives the student of military history an amazing look at the events (and the man) who turned the US Army into an organization that was capable of taking a leading role in winning WWII.Wedemeyer rose from a Major in 1941 (when he began to write the Victory Plan), to Lt. General by the end of the war. Although eclipsed by battlefield generals such as Patton and MacArthur, his contribution to winning the war was so significant that President Regan awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom.A ""must have"" book for any serious student of the military art."
1,Kindle Content Unacceptable,"While I would give high marks to this book-I'm reading it in paperback, the Kindle version of this book is of such poor quality that I returned it for a refund. The typeface is not consistent, including bold sections of body text (i.e. text other than titles or section headings.) Also interspersed in the content are page images that are followed by that page in kindle text.If the publisher or another publisher provides a better kindle copy, I will most certainly come back to purchase this book."
3,GOOD TEXT BOOK,"The book is very good but it is structured like a text book. Its couching is a little heavy, not flowing like a science popularization book.I found some mistakes. For example, the author says that the electric field and the magnetic field of an electromagnetic wave are out of phase (a diagram is shown) and that is not true. Since electromagnetics is not the field of expertise of the author, this is understandable and does not devaluate the rest of the book."
2,Not what I expected,"I was ten years old when this movie was released...a little young to have much interest in seeing it. After so many years of hearing what a great movie it was, I finally broke down and watched it. It was not the uplifting story I expected.I gave it two stars only because of the talent of some of the actors. The story, however, left a lot to be desired. You watch all these talented (and some not so talented) kids try to get in this school for the performing arts and learn their respective crafts. You begin to take interest in some of their lives and can't wait to see how things turn out for them. Well, guess what, you're never going to know. Based on the mostly dark mood of the movie and the promising alumnus we later see waiting tables, the chance for actual fame for any of them seems slim to none. Basically, your hopes build up for some of these characters, but you're just left hanging. Roll credits, big disappointment."
3,Leroy was the only reason to watch......,"I hate to say it, but I just saw this movie for the first time yesterday (I taped it off TV). I mean, I've always knew what ""Fame"" was and I have little flashbacks from the theme song on TV, I've just never seen it for whatever reason. I was almost 1 years old when the original movie came out. The only excitement I got out of this movie was seeing Leroy's audition in the beginning. So sexy and seductive! It really got to me! The rest of it......mmmmmmm......wasn't developed enough. During their senior year, you'd think you were watching stories about grown adult's lives! What teenager does comedy in a comedy club? What grown man isn't arrested for taking child porn (scene with Irene Cara at the end)? It didn't seem to make too much sense to me. Glad to have been able to see it, tho. If I do buy this movie, as I said, it'll be just for Leroy's audition and to see his sexy self throughout the film. I'm scared to see the newer version of ""Fame""......."
3,"Ummmm... OK? I DON""T Get It, WHY?","The premise about high schoolers who go to a performing arts school sounded interesting. and IS good. However there is NO plot, and little character development for that matter. Every time you know something about a character that makes you want to know more, you are NOT told ANYMORE, very thrustating. The modern sounding score is the 2nd best I've heard so for. (Andrew Lloyd Webber is the best at that.) if it would have had more songs it would have been A LOT better. I don't think I'll watch this movie again, or the remake, or the TV series."
4,I'm going to live forever...,"I love this movie. I am a fan of all things ""musical"". But this is a classic and I am very excited for the remake - hopefully it will do it justice!!!"
2,Class Reunion of a Great Film?,"I was thrilled to see that Fame was finally coming to DVD. I read the list of extras and couldn't wait to watch. Well, if you're like me, you're expecting current interviews with the actors that played Coco, Leroy, Montogomery and Co. What you get is a tour of the actual school in New York - that the film makers weren't even given permission to use in the film!O.k. kids, but again, not the real deal. Couldn't Warner's track down these people to sit for interviews and reminices like other DVDs (A Christmas Story)? I mean, the old featurette was pretty good, the commentary by Parker is o.k., but where is the original cast? This is one time where I feel truly taken by 'creative' advertising. Shame on you Warners."
3,School for Talented young people,I was disappointed in this one. The TV program by the same name let you get more info on the charactors. This one didn't have the time to go in to more in depth stories behind the different parts. I lost interest and didn't want to see it again.
4,Profanity alert,Watched with my 23 year old daughter before we watched the new one. Music was fabulous! Storyline very good. Profanity through the roof (had to take away a star)
4,FAME is great!,FAME is a wonderful movie...but you can hardly tell when it is really a musical or not. Sure they might sing...but a musical has people usually singing at an odd time...not in a singing class...
2,Fame,I forgot that I enjoyed the tv series a lot better than the movie. There were too many characters with too many issues and the movie was too short to cover them all. The tv series allowed these issues to be explored. It was was a good concept for a movie but not put together well at all. I forgot how disappointing the movie was.
4,Leonard Maltin says it best...it could have been great,"While the film has much to offer, as far as story and character development, it's too bad the television series isn't on tape instead. The first couple seasons delve into the relationships and situations that are only hinted at in the film as it skips ahead through the cast's full high school careers."
4,Good Solid Entertainment,Fame is one of those movies that makes you want to be a performer (no matter how bad of a singer or dancer you are)...It is motivational and the songs definately add to the theme of the movie...and yes there are parts of the movie that slow it down (the unexpected pregnancy is one that comes to mind)...Overall this is the kind of movie that makes you feel good after watching it...And that is part of entertainment...to feel good when you leave the theatre.
1,ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE!,"Uggg! The only reason I saw this movie was because of the Rocky Horror segment. Next to no music, terrible acting, terrible characters and terrible sub-plots. Stick to true musicals!"
3,Weak excuse for a film,"The Bottom Line:A film that feels (like MASH, come to think of it) in every way like the extended pilot for a TV show, Fame takes 134 minutes but doesn't really have time to develop any single character, instead giving thumbnail sketches of many and in-depth portrayals of none; before you know it it's over and you realize that in the time you spent watching caricatures go through the motions you could have watched Chinatown again.2/4"
3,I watched this because I liked the show as a kid.,"I remember likeing the show as a kid and I also knew a girl in college that went to this High School so that was enough to get me interested in the movie. I also spent seven years in NYC and miss it so that was another motivation.But, despite the movie being fun it left me unsatisfied. There was just too much tried to fit into a two hour film. All four years of High School were covered for over half a dozen kids. This left each relatively undeveloped and more questions in my mind than resolved plot lines.The music and dancing were enjoyable and over all the movie was a pleasant watch but it was far from a great movie."
2,Just okay,"There is nothing really great here, though parts of it are entertaining. Some of the characters are real jerks which you may find off-putting. The acting is so-so and it is quite a long and drawn-out story that doesn't have much of a plot because so many people are involved; there isn't much time devoted to each of them."
1,Did not work for me at all.,"Not only did this DVD not work it actually go me so riled up that I really could not sleep! Some of the scenes and sounds are good visuals and some are just plain stupid....like a scene of a cat sleeping or cartoon sheep jumping a fence.....a few others I find fairly entrancing. The main problem I found was that the visuals, clouds, etc., moved much too fast. I was able to slow them down with my DVD controls but that cuts out the sound and the motion was good at a 1/7 speed. But my real problem was that, even with my TV adjusted to it's lowest light level, the visuals were far too bright and lit up the room. One should be able to have them very dim as the room is darkened for sleep! I simply can't believe the producers of this DVD ever tried it and believed it works. I have studied hypnotism and simple slow visuals are all that is necessary. One good feature is the ability to time your session and mix sights and sounds."
4,Good writing but disturbing!,"I thought that Corey Mitchell did a good job depicting the story. He did not give too much or too little detail and basically did an excellent job; however, the story was disturbing to me. Rex Krebbs is an animal and I was elated at the end to find out he got the death penalty; hands-down. If you like true-crime, I'm sure you will enjoy this book, however, be prepared to feel nauseated at what he did to these two beautiful young girls."
5,Riveting!,"This book is a tragedy, not only for the victims of Rex Krebs, but because of his childhood. His neglect & abuse was the perfect combination to create a serial killer. This man obviously needed a family & support system, but never got it.Highly recommended."
5,Very much like Ann Rule,"If you like Ann Rule's style; fairly straightforward without a lot of embellishment on character, then this book is for you. The writer provides details on the events but never interprets.Ann Rule generally is not my favorite, but many people read her and like her."
4,DEAD AND BURIED,"This book was an interesting read. I have read better books, but it was still a page-turner."
2,Suspenseless and plodding,"Having read the many positive reviews of Dead and Buried, I assumed this would be a real page turner. Instead, it was a dull book that only made me feel terribly depressed. The only joy was finishing it, knowing I would have to work through any more repetitive chapters. I think the best true crime books keep the reader turning each page to learn more about the crimes, how the predators were caught, their mistakes, etc. There is tension, suspense, fear and hope - even though we know many will die before justice is served. Mitchell's book had little to do with how the police captured this predator - it was anti-climactic, anyway. Just the standard biographical filler, a summary of his crimes, and a few predictable chapters on his trial (spoiler: he's guilty, of course). It's all so utterly predictable. In the end, this seemed more like pornography than true crime. Or perhaps a 400 page newspaper article on these murders. Ann Rule has nothing to fear here....."
5,Dead and Buried,Wow! Another great book by Corey Mitchell. This one is probably my favorite and I've read all of his books. This held my attention from cover to cover!
3,Buyer beware!,"I only gave these cards a ""3"" due to how the product is represented. I bought these cards for a friend that was just starting out. I thought this was suppose to be a ""set"" as shown in the picture as in she would be getting: the cards, the book, AND the pouch to hold the cards in. Imagine my surpise when she opened her gift to find only the cards and the book! NO pouch is included in this set what-so-ever! If you are going to show a picture as to what comes in a set, you should include ALL the items, not just part. So buyer beware!"
2,Your own perspective,"I was looking for a deck that spoke to me. This one spoke in just the wrong way. The imagery is modern, but the deck does not fit me personally. As well as the imagery on the Tower card, it was not exactly appropriate for the lesson."
5,The best jig saw out there,"I own a Rockwell bayonet saw, it is exactly like the Porter-cable part for part. As you know Rockwell doesn't make these anymore and hasn't for years. The one I have is at least 30 years old. Works PERFECT. IF, for any reason I have to ever get another jig saw, I would definately get a Porter Cable Bayonet saw hands down the best most heavy duty saw you can possible purchase. Worm drive and oil lubricated they will last forever."
4,Precious Gift,"I bought this Compact Bible as a present for my teen-aged nephew. It, indeed, is going to be the apple in his eyes.As I open the box,(sorry, Amazon)I was speechless to find out that wonderful Bible has a RUSTY SNAP."
2,More Inferior Quality from Thomas Nelson,"The compact NKJV with Snap-Flap is a good, portable edition to carry around. However, in my opinion, Nelson Bibles are typically of very poor quality and durability---the Bibles are glue-bound instead of being sewn, and their life expectancy is limited. Again, in my opinion, snap-flap Bibles are a nuisance, with the flap hanging in your way as you handle the Bible when open. If you must have this edition, try it without the snap-flap."
3,Bible,"I purchased this over a year ago but it's already falling apart. It's compact, that part is true, but the binding is tearing and the cover has worn thin. I wouldn't recommend this product - buy a better made Bible."
1,Worthless Abilities...,"This equalizer is utterly worthless. The input gain structure is unstable and the equalizer is not shelved properly. This unit is pointless and will give you nothing more than a shiny chrome resemblance of an eq and will surely give you pure frustrations. Pony up for a real equalizer... Try Clarion, JL, Hifonics, etc.."
3,"Decent book, but not so complete","After picking up several books on related subjects, unfortunately this book ended up closer to the bottom of my reading pile. This book is loosely organized into many, many small chapters that seem to jump around quite a bit. Histories and anecdotes concerning demons are touched upon, but there seems to be an apologist's slant to everything. As if he is constantly reminding the reader that evil is bad instead of just giving us the history. Almost as though he is backing away from Hell, just in case it's all real and he's indicted by God for writing a book on the subject. I prefer a more objective approach to this sort of topic but all in all not terrible. (It's suprising to me how few good books are out there on demonology)"
2,A Sophomoric treatment of an Interesting subject,"Leonard Ashley's pathetic excuse of designing this book for the ""sound bite"" and ""limited attention span"" generation is an insult and affront to his readers.The book is nothing but a mish-mash and mosaic of information culled from the Internet that the author has so carelessly put together.For beginners and the uninitiated- this might briefly prove interesting- but in general- this book is a sleeping pill in disguise."
3,Don't let my grade fool you!,"This actually is a VERY good book, despite the fact that I only gave it 3 stars. My only problems with the book were:Format - The format is VERY difficult to follow at first, don't give up on it though. Once you understand how he put the book together, it's not so bad. My other problem with the format was that it's not the most efficient way to present the information.needless information, or information better placed elsewhere - Admit it, run on sentences with parenthesis all over the place ARE hard to follow. Theres not alot of this, but it's there. Also, acknowledgments and other suggested reading would be better placed together at the back of the book, instead of being scattered throughout the chapter within the material brought forth.Otherwise, as long as you've either studied this subject before, or are well educated, you can get whatever you need from this book. Once you get past all these distractions it is quite some exceptional reading."
3,Fascinating but hard to follow,"The book is a good reference point for those looking into this subject for the first time. While the author provides a lot of information, her style in presenting it leaves something to be desired. The book format is put together in such a way that it makes it difficult for the reader to follow. There are also a lot of errors in grammar like misspelled words and run-on sentences. It seems the author would have noticed this, but I guess he was in a hurry. If you can live with the format then you may want to check it out. However, you may want to try ""Encyclopedia of Hell"" by Miriam Van Scott."
4,Difficulties in Demonology,"For many years I have studied many variations on Theology, including its evil brother Demonology. Finding a source with as much variety and coverage on the subject as this book has always been difficult. This book is the most in depth and well rounded I have found of its kind. My only complaint is its lack of organization. While it may all be in there, good luck finding it. However due to the detail and study that went into it this doen't dilute the power of this book, and I still give it 4 stars."
3,Fine for brainstorming but little use otherwise.,"Let's imagine you are thinking about buying that espresso stand down beside the street corner near your home. ""Hmmm....wonder if that is a goldmine waiting to be mined?""If so, this book is an adequate first step in your research. It touches a wide range of topics with a scientific, by-the-numbers approach. Therein lies the fault.You see, entrepreneurship is not a science. It is an art. So, too, is service and great coffee!By all means, buy of read ESPRESSO! STARTING & RUNNING YOUR OWN SPECIALTY COFFEE BUSINESS first. The ESPRESSO BARTENDERS GUIDE TO ESPRESSO BARTENDING has to be the next book on your journey to making a living brewing great coffee.Before you buy that espresso stand, though, get hold of RETAIL MANAGEMENT by Ron Hasty and learn why the location of that stand may, or may not, be in a good location for your target market! Bill Anderson."
3,Limited Scope,This book is good if you are interested in a Cart or Kiosk coffee business. It does not go in to much detail in other types of coffee businesses.
2,Very Basic,This book barely skims what you will need to know to open a specialty coffee establishment. If you are interested in opening a cart or kiosk or are just toying with the idea of opening an espresso establishment; then this book is a good starting point. If you are planning to open an espresso shop or drive through then I suggest that you put your money elsewhere.
3,Thinking about a Coffee Business??,"This should be the title ""Thinking about running a Coffee Business"" I gave this 3 stars because it is very easy to read, straight to the point, does point out some warning signs.If your already in the business then, forget it."
2,Rather disappointing,"This book was useful for a few things for the absolute beginner (which I was when I read it), such a lists of supplies, questions to ask potential suppliers, and some basic info about how espresso machines work, plus the vocabulary to go with them, but beyond that was filled with a lot of not-so-helpful filler. It focuses too much on espresso carts considering it didn't represent itself as being for that (if that's what you want to do, it'll be more helpful) and even goes so far as to be condescending at times - reminding you to be polite in challenging a demonstrator to pull a better shot of espresso if the first one is lacking. Overall not a complete waste of money, but definitely not something I'll be referring back to."
2,thin coffee,"This book is better than nothing but has no real depth. It lacks any real financal information or planning guidelines. In the era of the web there are almost no sites or addresses listed.This is just a walk in the park where it must have been written. If you are serious, look elsewhere."
3,Espresso,I found this book to be a little vague. There are lots of forms at the back of the book which I found to be helpful
1,don't waste your money.,"This book provided very little useful information. There are many other books out there that will really help you with your coffee adventure. why the sample forms were interesting, they were not useful at all. overall, the book was very basic."
2,Pretty skimpy,"The book was disappointing. Very thin, under 200 pages, black and white photos that are low res. Very little detail with some areas comically lightly covered. Too many years and generations are covered (if you are working on a first gen you don't care about a '78 Camaro.I would keep looking for a better reference, let me know if you find one."
2,OK but no really good info,"Bought this because i am restoring a camaro, hoping for some good info and or tips for this type of job.but only had ""common knowledge"" info readily avalible on the internet and pictures of the same three camaros over and over.Would not recommend,much better books out there."
4,Vibrating Slippers?!?,"Yep, and my feet are thanking me. When I get home after a long day, I put these slippers on my feet and relax. If you need something comfortable on your feet that can relax your muscles, by all means, pick up a pair of these slippers."
1,do not buy this dictionary,"my old dictionary just broke so i bought this one because it had good reviews. absolutely false. i'm furious. i just received this yesterday, and i'm sitting here trying to do my french homework and absolutely NONE of the words i need are in this book. maybe this would work for a beginner who doesn't need to know any important words in the french language, but if you've taken more than a year of french forget this dictionary. it's absolutely worthless. the title should say dictionary for beginners. even the print makes it look like it's for 10 year olds."
3,Not the most user-friendly,Actually just a regular pocket french dictionary works better for me. I didn't think the lay out was all that handy.
2,Incorrect dimensions,"be careful when purchasing these cabin air filters. these are not the right dimensions. my vehicle is a 2006 toyota tacoma base trd model 4dr dcab. the filter size i measured is 8 1/8"" x 8 1/8"" x 25/32"" (206.4 x 206.4 x 19.8). Please correct/update these info.thanx"
2,"The sound of the mighty , falling further","I consider Wonderboy+ and Plano as pioneering albums of the po-mo pop era. Pedals had its moments, but tried too hard for ""art."" Sadly, Pelo continues this unfortunate trend, and abandons most of the really good stuff the Aluminum Group had going for it. (Way too much form, not enough function, you know? We ask for Chocolates, you give us a semiotic reading of a cook book.) I hope the boys realize that exquisite, brainy pop is more than art enough. And the fact that I love Sally Timms breaks my heart even further. She deserves better, guys!"
1,Pelops,"Pelo(ps) was a son of Tantalus. Daddy served sonny to the Olympians as food, but a good-hearted Hermes decided to restore sonny to life. Had Hermes tasted Pelo, after a gastric lavage he'd quickly flush the leftover lest some fellow gods decide to make the miracle... A major disappointment after a couple of pearls."
3,Halfway Between,"On their fourth CD Pelo The Aluminum Group land halfway between the sharp chamber pop of their charming Plano and the hollow overreaching of its follow-up Pedals. Gay brothers John and Frank Navin guide their collective through these ten supple, ambisexual songs, never as playful as their think they're being (except on the pseudo-instrumentals ""Pussycat"" and ""Pussy Reprise"") nor as pretentious as a few of the titles would imply. The brothers have deep voices that borderline pomposity, which compounds their moonier ideas (like ""Tom of Finland [An Homage]""!) and adds poignancy to their hyper-romanticism. ""If You've Got a Lover, You've Got a Life"" is a highlight, if not also a statement of intent, and they're best when they're fast and funny, as on that track and ""Satellite"". On the slow ones, however, they're not only ponderous, they're dim-witted."
3,"Good game, but gets old fast","Overall, Oil Tycoon is a very-well structured game. The game itseself, however, wears out its flair after a couple of hours. The gameplay focuses on making money, but if you obtain a stable business account, the game gets incredibly tedious. For instance, before you can build your own oil tankers to haul oil to either your own oil refinary, or, more likely, a neutral refinary. In order to get these tankers, you need to charter them. The contract expires after one haul, so you have to charter ships over and over and over again until you just want to vomit. Also, when you construct a new oil well, you have to hire employees and engineers, as well as buying/leasing new equipment and getting food for your miners.Oil Tycoon isn't a bad game; it just gets old too fast. Overall, this is a good simulation game for you hyper-realists, but otherwise, beware."
1,Too Tedious,Many of the repetitive features on this game could have been automated and would have made it a much better game. There is too much repition. Buy Railroad Tycoon instead.
2,Fun but boring,I thought the game was really fun but after a few hours i got sick of doing the same think over and over again i wouldnt recomend buying this game.
5,"Great pan, reasonable price","Tight locking mechanism, doesn't leak, turns out perfect cheesecakes. Feels sturdy and of high quality."
2,Not the original Ink Spots,"I had hoped to hear the original recordings that I grew up with, but was disappointed to find songs interspersed between the originals that were clearly made later in time, and not by the original Ink Spots. I bought the CD to hear the originals of Whispering Grass and Java Jive, but they were both recorded by another group. The newer renditions aren't bad, but it's jarring to suddenly have such a different take - more orchestration - and entirely different vocals. I returned it."
1,I disliked this book,"I really didn't like this book. As usual I was looking for diet inspiration, so having read about this book and seeing it for sale at a good price, I bought it. It was really hard to read. Parts of it are written like the person speaking, for example, a German lady with her ""ve"" instead of ""we"" so you have to practically translate. It was like a stream of consciousness. I prefer books to be written in straightforward practical way. If you are looking for that kind of book, skip this one. I wish I had read this review before I bought it."
2,I finally gave it away...,"I purchased this camera along with supersampler at the same time. Both with 4 lens camera, the picture quality on action sampler turned out so poor that I only played with it for one roll of film, then put it back to the box, and finally, gave to my friend(cuz she wanted a toy camera)...well...it does have a fun outlook, but if you really wanna enjoy a 4 lens camera, I would suggest to buy a supersampler, at least the quality is better."
3,The Insect TrustHoboken Saturday Night good album,"What was the counterculture, anyway - America's last hopeful moment, or just a bunch of stoners making tragic fashion choices? This 1970 album from a band of East Coast VIP freaks (including the late, great music critic Robert Palmer on reeds) suggests that it was nothin' but a party good enough to blow your mind. Country blues, ragtime, avant-jazz, New Orleans gumbo, psychedelia and straight-ahead pop all get play here; one song features lyrics by novelist Thomas Pynchon, while another was co-authored by a 6-year-old. In this reissue's liner notes, Blender contributor Robert Christgau calls the Insect Trust ""pluralistic tolerance in action, at once traditionalist, futuristic and entranced with the here and now."" In other words, it's what democracy sounds like."
5,lost classic,"It took me many years to hunt this one down, and it did not disappoint. This was the best record of 1969. Even Christigau liked it. Nowadays, you can snag a copy for a few dollars. Enjoy!"
3,Not too bad,The sticks are a little small for my 8 yr. old. The book is hard to understand without a basic background in music. Wish there was a c.d. or something with it. It arrived on time. Good price.
4,A good overview of Joseph Smith,"I bought this book after seeing the author on CSPAN talking about the book from a bookstore in Salt Lake City. He admits that he is not a Mormon, but he found Joseph Smith an intersting person. After reading the book I can see that Remini does like Joseph Smith, yet he didn't appear to write the book to raise him up, nor tear him down.As a member of the Church myself, a lot of the information he presents is from Church sources, and I've read a lot of it before. But I really enjoyed the material he gave from other sources. I got a feel for Joseph Smith as a person, which, like all prophets since Adam, he really was. I would recommend this book to members and non-members alike."
1,Not as unbiased as claimed,"The auther says this is an unbiased historical statement of facts, with no bias for or against Joseph Smith. All information presented against Joseph Smith is presented as factual while all information in favor of Joseph is presented as unfounded opinion or passed off as ""according to Smith..."". I believe the author tried to look into Josephs life, but was extremely resistant to accept any information in favor of Joseph Smith. It was quite dissapointing to listen to on tape. Not recommended."
1,Very disappointing,"Though Remini makes a sincere attempt to objectively evaluate a prominent religious figure, the work is poorly written, poorly researched, and quite dull. Remini commits a myriad of chronological mistakes, spelling errors, and factual missteps that are glaring to both LDS and non-LDS audiences. It appears as though this brief work was rushed to the press without thorough historical analysis. He also uses a number of questionable sources with dubious authenticity.Remini frequently inserts a variety of wild conjectures without appropriate justification or explanation. He also makes an obvious effort to link Joseph Smith with other subjects that Remini has intensely studied (e.g. the Jacksonian era), however irrelevant the connection. On the whole, I regard this book as very low quality among biographical works, particularly in the examination of a complex religious figure that demands a more rigorous approach."
2,Thoughtful but ignores too much church history/RLDS,"I admire the author's thoughtful words, but by ignoring the Reorganized LDS church, which the Prophet's son Joseph Smith III founded in 1860 with Emma Smith's assistance, a huge part of church history goes unmentioned. The RLDS (now called Community of Christ) has in it's headquarters in Independence MO, two portraits, one of Joseph Smith Jr, and one of his wife Emma Smith. I believe these were painted during Joseph's lifetime, thereby making the statement in the back of this book's jacket that the cover portrait is the only one painted during Joseph's lifetime inaccurate."
2,Boring,"This is a pretty boring account of Joe's life and his founding of the Church of Mormon. It's also incredulous. You can understand backwards people of 200 years falling for this tripe but how anyhow today could buy this fantastic tale is beyond me.If you want to know what the hype is, this is a fair account but it's slow dull going."
1,Too nice,The author bends over backwards to be nice to his subject. Most good biographies are more balanced than this one so we can learn more about the man.
5,Eminently readable and well researched.,"Truly, I sometimes wonder what book my colleague reviewers here read. This is one of those cases. This is a wonderfully concise biography of a vital personage in American religion. Author Remini, a distinguished historian, especially regarding Jacksonian era America, very even handedly presents succinctly the life of a brilliant, if flawed (perhaps brilliantly flawed) human being. Most fascinatingly, the connections he makes between the rise of Mormonism and the socio-religio-political climate of the day are vibrantly fresh and compelling. The LDS folks have lots of lengthy and wildly variant documents of their early history; this brief biography tidily abridges, without fatally degrading."
3,Unbiased historical information.,"I felt that this was a good initial source for a historical look at an important purely American religous figure. Remini is always a source of a good, well arranged historical essay. For those that like a good informative historical read Dr. Remini is a consistently superior resource. I like my history presented with minimal bias and commentary, I have read several of Dr. Remini's books and have enjoyed them all to date."
4,Old school,If you like old school 80s with some powerful and in your face lyrics this is a must have. I never was a Hanoi Rocks fan but I think Michael Monroe has much to offer in heavy metal even to this day. In addition to this I also saw Michael Monroe in St. Paul the year Not Fakin' it came out and got more than my money's worth. Monroe is also an excellent harp player. Check it out!
5,Substantive reasons to give the Living God your problems.,"This book is uplifting for those of us who have failed in areas of our lives which are important and for which we feel disappointment. Dr. Graham confronts all areas of life, including life itself, and presents the powerful proof that God loves us in spite of our failings. He also focuses in on the IMPORTANCE OF YOUR LIFE so that you may understand better why YOUR LIFE IS IMPORTANT even if you sometimes think it isn't. If you have failed in an important area of your life or if you have children or friends who need substantive words of encouragement, or if you simply need encouragement, you will find this book a valuable resource.""It's like a glass of fresh iced tea on a hot, dry, dusty day in Texas.""Thanks again Dr. Graham for submitting your life and works to our Maker."
5,loved it,This high quality bookcase with doors was already assembled when it arrived. I had no unpleasant surprises. I got exactly what I wanted.
4,Trixie Belden & The Mysterious Code,"My daughter and I just finished reading this book, and we enjoyed it. Definitly one of our favorites. My daughter is anxious to write messages in secret code now! A good read for any Trixie Belden fan."
2,The second star is only because it's Trixie.,"This is certainly the worst of the Trixie Belden series. It seems to be written for a younger audience than the other installments. I don't think the series creator used this particular writer again, and with good cause. The ""mysterious code"" referenced in the title is discovered, decoded and forgotten in the first quarter of the book. The rest of the slow, repetitive story revolves around an antique show the Bob-Whites are holding for charity."
4,Great Cable,"I have purchased many cheaper cables before than this one without seeing them first hand before my purchase, and have never really been satisfied with the end result. Therefore, I was kind of nervous paying more for a cable without seeing it in person first. However, I was pleasantly surprised with this piece. the cable coating is of very high quality, as well as are the screw on connectors. I would recommend this to anyone seeking a good coaxial cable."
4,Nice co-ax,"Appears to be a high-quality co-ax. No issues with the connections or picture on my 50'' plasma. Only minor issue was a bent prong inside one end of the connections. I took some pliers to straighten it out, and from what I can tell it didn't hurt its performance at all."
5,Worth it,"A good, sturdy cable. have had trouble in the past with flimsy coaxial cables where the coax slips off and it is impossible to keep plugged in, this one is sturdier and worth the price."
4,"Great quality, no change it picture quality for me though","The Belkin PureAV coaxial cables seem to be very well made, they're easy to attach to a wall cable outlet or into a cable box or to the back of a television set.They did not help my picture quality at all though.I was hoping for a better picture and was worth shot but no dice for me."
5,High quality cable,"I'm lucky that I have Cox cable, it's, very, very fast. I wanted to make sure I didn't slow it down with a cheap coax cable so I got this one. When I hooked it to the fastest Motorola 3.0 DOCSIS modem available the result was amazing, I'll never complain about road blocks again because my internet is now faster than ever. If you want to set up a high speed LAN [wired or wireless] then you need to start by using a quality cable to bring the internet to your cable modem. This is the one to buy."
2,Belkin PureAV Cable Review,"This cable is very confusing. I used this cable to connect my antenna to my house over the roof. The construction quality is not bad, however it starts peeling in just a couple of days. The flexibility of this cable is not the best because I tried to screw on the cable into the antenna and it was very hard. The reason it was hard because it was not flexible enough to get under the antenna and screw on. This is why I rate a two star. Because of this I had problems with this product."
1,Cable to nowhere,"This arrived and looked like a nicely made, strong cable. It was easy to install. However, the tip attaching it to the wall snapped off within a week of having it. If you buy this, be aware that it is not very durable!"
4,Do you believe in magic?,"NOT just another unicorn story, this fine first novel casts a rich golden glow that lingers with the reader. As much Americana as fantasy novel, ""Unicorn Highway"" makes such phrases as ""heartwarming"" and ""uplifting"" seem fresh and new again. Fans of both ""Field of Dreams"" and Ray Bradbury""s ""Dandelion Wine"" will find much to love and savor here - but this tribute to the power of the imagination is in no way derivative of those works, weaving its own down-to-earth magic in deceptively simple prose as clean and beautiful as Shaker furniture. What a wonderful movie it would make! I hope we won't have to wait long for more from this promising author."
5,Perfect for my son's car - a huge Broncos fan!,"This was something I'd been looking for for my son since he got his car in July. He is a huge Broncos fan and since we live in the east, it's hard to find Broncos stuff unless you shop at [...], and they charge a fortune for everything!Found this in time for Christmas, and my son is so pleased.The item was shipped promptly and arrived in excellent condition and in plenty of time for Christmas.Thanks!"
3,MyOp,A rare and precious record!Really enjoyable!Good packaging!Only a few scratches on the back coverAll in all I'm completely satisfied!Great record!
1,A new tonic for insomnia,"My wife found a damaged copy of Confessions for a few dollars, and bought it for me as a joke. She and I have both laughed for years at Jancis' smarmy tone in her column in Wine Spectator, though I also found her very knowledgeable about wine. Writing about herself rather than wine, Jancis has lost any sense of what the reader might possibly care about. It is the single most boring book I have read in my life, including chemistry textbooks. I seriously use it to fall asleep at night. It puts me out cold in 1/2 page, on average. That's worth a star!"
5,Must-read for a baseball fan.,"I am an avid baseball fan and have read many related books including the best-selling ""Moneyball"" and even the infamous ""Juiced: Wild Times, Rampant 'Roids, Smash Hits, and How Baseball Got Big"". But Fred Claire's ""My 30 Years in Dodger Blue"" is defintitely one of the best ones I've read. It may even rival ""Moneyball"". In the book, Claire gives his honest opinion and story of the Dodgers and its personnel and owner. Although many blame him for the trades of Pedro Martinez and Mike Piazza, one must not forget that he built a championship team in 1988."
5,Fred Claire: My 30 Years in Dodger Blue,Have the honor of knowing Fred for many years. In his book he offers unusual insight regarding the inner working of administering a major league Baseball team.
5,"Great book, excellent history, honest, dramatic and fun","Unlike the typical self-aggrandizing sports memoir, this one puts a very honest face on a remarkable 30-year career that spanned enormous changes in baseball, for better and worse. Consider that when Claire joined the Dodgers, Steinbrenner had not yet bought the Yankees--for $10 million. And, when Claire left the Dodgers after Fox bought the team, that was a decent salary for one top player for one year.He does not spare himself in terms of a hard and analytical look at the record, including great trades made, and some not made. The book has many dramatic moments, including dealing with the drug addiction of Maury Wills and Darryl Strawberry, or the legendary Kirk Gibson home run, and funny ones, as in what player stole the wheels from Walter O'Malley's golf cart in spring training?For most fans, who sit in the stands as armchair GM's, this is a look at how that job is really done, and done well."
3,Great camera; not for MACs,"This camera is advertised here as being MAC compatible. It absolutely is not. Save yourself a headache, and only buy this if you want to connect it to a PC."
4,Poor IEEE-1394 support,"I bought my camera over a year ago and I'm very please with all the options. Great zoom, great night shoot, take great quality movies and all. The only drawback I've found so far is the IEEE-1394 support. There's no way to sincronize it when capturing video using the firewire option. The sound is garbled when using with Vegas Foundry 4.0 and the capture run too fast out of sinc on windows movie maker 2. I tried everything including using my other computer which has a different type of IEEE-1394 card and the problem is the same. I tried getting some help from the people at Sony but all they say is they are not responsible with compatibility issues with third party firewire cards. It doesn't matter how many times you write them, that is the only answer you get. So, with that and all, is not a bad camera at all, just don't plan on using firewire for your movie capture, just be please with the usb or you can use the s-video option if you have a vide capture card."
4,Great Deal,"I've had this camcorder for a while know, and i have to say that for the prize excelent FOR ME. Know the Sony TRV-140 isnt all flowers, it does have some but few flaws.1. Steady Shot isnt superb.2. REC button some times gets stuck and it wont retract after you press it like it should, but dont worry because i fixed that with just a little bit of grase.Well know let me tell you ,the things that you will appreciate from the Sony TRV-140.1. USB Streaming.2. DVin/out port3. Super NightSHot"
1,Great Camera - but now it is broken with little use,"I am very dissapointed with SONY products in general. They have always been my preferred brand for TVs and other electronics over the years. But in the past 5 years we have purchased a home entertainment center and this camcorder and with hardly any use they are both broken and obviously out of warranty. The home entertainment center was fixed by Sony by them sending us a completely new unit - and it has the exact same error message as the old one - and we hardly used the thing and now it is broken, out of warranty and stuck on the ""Standby"" message which blinks continuously :( And For the Camcorder - we only used it occasionally and have recorded a total of 3 of the mini tapes and now SONY wants me to pay $211 flat rate to fix unit since it is out of warranty... Very dissapointing - especially since I always believed they made quality products. We will not purchase SONY products again."
5,Wonderful Christmas Songs,"Stevie Wonder's Someday At Christmas was originally released in 1967 and the title track still remains relevant today, especially so in these troubled times. The song is an elegant and eloquent hope for a world that is filled with peace, equality and free of poverty , hatred and hunger. The song was referring to the Vietnam War and the Civil Rights movement, but the lyrics can easily be applied to the state of the world today. The song is absolutely beautiful and we should, now more than ever, try to achieve the ideals the song expouses."
5,Childhood Memories,"This Christmas album is the best compilation of holiday music of all time. Ave Maria is beautiful. I don't think I have found an album that tops it yet!IF you love Stevie Wonder, you will love this one."
5,No Christmas without Stevie...,"I love this collection. Its difficult to descibe what his songs bring to Christmas. Most inspiring rendition of Schubert's Ave Maria. The day that love began and One little Christmas tree will bring a tear to your eye. Thats what Christmas means to me is so full of life and a very enjoyable track. Someday at Christmas is so appropriate to listen to in these belicose times. Silver Bells rings in Christmas time. If I had to pick a favourite song in the collection it would have to be Bedtime for toys. This is a wonderful collection. I only wish that artists, who record Christmas collections at the drop of a hat, would listen to this collection to realize what Christmas can mean with a beautiful rendition like this."
3,How can you go wrong with Stevie and Christmas?,"Maybe Stevie can't go wrong, but other producers and songwriters can. Too bad this album was made before Stevie took control of his own career. If he wrote his own original songs and produced the music, this album could have been much, much better. Instead you get one classic Motown style original (""What Christmas Means To Me""), and few great interpretations of classic Christmas songs (highlighted by ""Silver Bells"" and ""Ave Maria""), but the rest of the original songs are sappy and flat. The string section and choral arrangements sound like something you would expect from Johnny Mathis or Andy Williams, not from Stevie Wonder. It is still a good album, just not as good as you might expect."
2,there are other albums...,"... that are so much better, please check out this man's milestone masterpieces ""Songs in the key of life"" or ""Innervisions"""
5,Great gardening tool,"I finally tired of cheap nozzles and decided to buy this wand. What a fantastic tool. The spray options are all well thought out and very useful. The mist function actually mists! It's metal, very rugged and has a nice brass ball valve as well. Going to buy another one for my girlfriend."
4,Good Quality,Worked well for about 20 minutes and then the sand from my well started to plug the spay holes.Had to let dry and then shake sand out of head not the spayers problem. Like the pattern and even watering spread. Also a great on / off brass controller attached.
4,Came as promissed,Great aid for beginner coaches. I purchased this after watching all the free clips. This purchase was for my assistant coaches who have never coached.
4,Not like any other HP game they have for Game Cube,"This game was more of a standardized game, than the free-play type of the first three. In this game you have more set items you have to accomplish, and the overall setup is nothing like the others. If you like the first three, this one is extremely different, but this one is still worth playing. There are many differences though, so make sure you take your time."
3,Hoping for quiet & not so bright,"The overall appearance of this fan is fine--modern. It was also very easy to put together (I'm a woman saying this!)--minor assembly. I am on a specific mission for a QUIET fan for a guest bedroom/sleeping. This fan is a bit quieter than our old fan, but I was expecting even less noise at $55 (+shipping=$70). It still has the light sound of a propellor, which is fine in a living room, but more noticeable in a small bedroom. The large display again is fine for a living room, but it gives off a lot of colored lights which don't dim down after you make your selections. Again, too much distraction for someone trying to sleep in a small room, especially at night."
2,Mixed Review,"The fan was easy to put together. Sharp looking item, but the remote did not work, and there should be a setting to turn the LED's off, when awake they are nice and fun to see. but at night they can get annoying"
1,Not a fan of this one,"If you are looking for a sleek, modern and eyecatching fan, you've found it in the Soleus Air FS1-40R-41. It is black with a silver/ chrome look. It also features a colorful LCD readout. This fan has 3 speeds, 3 modes; normal, sleep and natural, and you have a choice to oscillate or not.All that, yet I was disappointed because it does not produce the amount of wind I like and need, especially at this price point. I live in a hot climate and this does not cool as I'd like. I have it placed next to the computer desk area. It stands less than 2 feet away from me while I am surfing the web. The output is fine, but even at the highest speed selection and pointing directly at me, the wind is still mediocre.It is pretty quiet and as I mentioned before looks great. But for this price and lack of power output I'd recommend bypassing this fan."
4,An interesting albumn,I suspect that your first reaction to the albumn title was What! I was surprised to find that the covers are well done and I enjoy listening to them. I especially like their versions of Black Dog and Stairway to Heaven. My only complaint is that some songs that I would have liked to have on the albumn are not there. I guess we can't have everything.
3,Good tool for those with disabilities,"This carefully handled guide book on a subject that is so painful and embarrassing to many is well written and actually quite timely with many helpful suggestions. For the person who has a body image problem due to a disability, accident or congenital defect or one who has lost sensation that would make intimacy difficult, this is a strongly recommended read.Whether a spinal cord injury, loss of sensation from Multiple Sclerosis, or a life altering surgery such as an ostomy or amputation, the author addresses ways to regain intimacy and potentially sexual ability as well.I recommend this book without reservation to my patients with sexual dysfunction and intimacy issues that are related to illness."
3,The World Isn't That Bad,"Pro: this was an exciting, interesting book. I enjoyed reading it and re-reading it.Con: Bruce Coville can get very preachy at times. In this book we look at the worst of humanity, and he makes it sound like all of humanity is a terrible violent monsters. But while there are horrible things in the world, you must realize they are showing us the worst-there are better! And with all the no doubt millions of alien races, we're the worst of the worst? Yeah, right. I especially hate it when he talks about the television as if it serves to purpose other than to turn our brain into swiss cheese.If you can get over the self-righteousness and the pessimism about the human race, this is a lovely book."
4,As the title says,"this is an introduction to the history of philosophical thinking throughout history, not an indepth treatment of ethics throughout history as one reviewer criticised it for not being (something it never stated it was).It is thorough without being overwhelming for someone interested in an introduction to philosopphy, and it is interesting not dry and boring or hard to follow as many philosophy books can prove to be.It is exactly what it says it is and does a good job at it."
5,Superb HISTORY,"This is not an introduction to philosophy of science; it is a history of the evolution of philosophy of science. As such, it serves its purpose very well."
5,This is a Great show,"Think of Mad Max meets Lord Of The Flies. Don't let the costumes, hair colors and makeup fool you. This show somehow pulls you in and makes you care about the characters and the world there now living in. For every teen that thought the world would be a better place without adults and think they could do a better job, think again. This is the world of THE TRIBE. How long could you live off tinned food (caned food) before you would have to organize farms? How would you get kids to work on a farm? Do you pay them? If so, with what? Or do you use kids as slaves? Who do you go to when you get sick? What to you do when all the antibiotics run out? All these and more are things that come up in THE TRIBE.I have all 5 box sets that I bought from Amazon UK years ago, but now I plan on getting the USA version too."
5,FINALLY!,"So, they finally came out on DVD! I randomly searched the Tribe on amazon.com to see if they had anything on region 1 and they finally did, had to wait years for it but it happened.Only downside of this DVD is that it's in two parts and I can't wait for June 12th. Every time I see an episode I need to watch them all, the show's amazing."
5,shout factory you've done it again!,"First it was the american, and japanese transformers episodes. Then vr troopers,mighty morphin power rangers,and big bad beetleborgs. Now the tribe, man what other of my favorite shows. Are you gonna put on dvd next? Please let it be the bionic six, mighty orbots, or dinosaucers! Shout factory keep up the good work!"
5,Amazing!,"I started watching this show back in 2002 i believe, maybe just before that. It became an intricate part of my life and i loved every minute of it. I got many friends addicted to the show too. so happy that it is finally being released in the USA. I have the UK dvd's but the USA ones are going to be top of my list and i can't wait to get them. Watch it and you won't be disapointed!"
5,Totally Adequate,It's simple. It works. It's never going to snap in half like that plastic shoe-horn I used to have. What more is there to say? I'm happy.
1,Please See The Photos I Uploaded,"The metal has no temper and is very soft. As you can see from the three photos that I have uploaded, how distorted the metal has become only after 2 or 3 uses. I do still use it because its all that I have but come on man.... I think plastic would have been better than this. I am a verified purchaser, and very disappointed. For those who gave 4 & 5 stars I just don't get it unless the intended use was for your small children."
1,Steel shoe horn,"Edges are cut at a sharp angle, have to be careful taking out horn not to cut the leather on shoe. would not recommend this product would rather get a wooden one instead. learn from my mistake!"
5,"Strong, sturdy shoehorn","This is an excellent product with a price you can't beat. We have always just had a plastic shoehorn, which is not useful when you need something sturdy. Unless you need something with a long handle for someone that cannot bend down, this shoehorn is highly recommended ."
2,Black and White Illustrations,"Do you want a book with pictures of gardens you can emulate at home? Keep looking. This book has no pictures, only close-up black and white illustrations of flowers."
3,needs more pictures,"This book did provide new info for me, but it would have been helpful to have more actual photos of plants."
1,Profoundly depressing,"I saw this book on the Telegraph's list of 100 Books Every Child Should Read. I think not. With references to the horrors of the Holocaust and somewhat disturbing illustrations, this book is not a children's book, but appears to have been written for adults. Profoundly depressed adults."
1,Not Good,This product definitely did not meet my expectation. I could not use the USB connection to view images from my dell duo inspiron to a projector. Do I need a software to make this work?I do not think I would recommend this product to anyone who intends to connect to a projector via USB.
1,USB port does not work,"I got this to take from my notebook USB to TV vga, but USB is useless, I don't know why they have a USB port, it is not working"
5,recomended,it is a very interesting and useful book. The methodology that is using for automated software testing is original and i like it. I recommend the book to students in System analysis and design course and also to Application development course.
3,Elfried- Find her descriptions rhetoric,Bought her top 50 tips for testing. Was so generic and generally devoid of ideas and inspiration. I expect this to be of equally low value going by the TOC. A really practical book of automation will be one which will plug in automation into over system integration testing strategy and show how it could be improved. On other hand take a deep technical dive and tell us how some of these tools such as QTP work.
1,Misleading book for managers.,"This book is entirely management with no technical content. Worse, the authors seem to think they know the technical side, and thus may mislead readers into thinking that they understand it as well. A major problem in software testing is that it is typically practiced by people who can't program and can't do math, and managed by people who not only can't do either, but don't realize that both skills are important to effective testing.I think we have enough process books ..."
3,Cut out the bull,"Unfortunately this book (like nearly all other books on software testing) does not teach you how to test software. Instead it only gives you information needed to manage software testing. And, like many other books of management, it is highly repetitive and redundant. For somebody needing compressed information this is the wrong book. I think it would be no big deal to reduce the number of pages to 50% and still deliver the same message. The exmamples given in the text read like from a psychology book, not like from a technical book. Despite my critique I have to admit that the annexes in the book can be highly valuable. Personally I liked best the review of the big number of test tools."
1,A Compilation of Generalizations,"As an engineer involved with software QA for a number of years, I found the book to be so generalized as to be essentially worthless. The authors devote page after page to explain methods and procedures with diagrams that depict the intuitively obvious. Their ATLM (Automated Test Life-Cycle Methodology) is as complicated as diagramming the Earth's water cycle. I don't need to spend Forty odd dollars and peruse 600 pages to learn that I might be able to use some nonspecific automated testing tool somewhere along the software development process."
4,Uncle John's movie,"God Bless you, Uncle John, for making this cinematic homage to the Seminole people! When I was a little boy, I always thought it was so impressive that you knew people like Fred MacMurray and Terry Thomas. I only wish you could have gotten me that introduction to my childhood crush - Hayley Mills! And I loved the stories of your friendship with Seminole Medicine Man Josie Billie.-Grayson Hugh"
3,Very Nice,"Fine product... no complaints at all. Heats fast, cools fast when off. Does everything I need for a nice price.EDIT:Changed my rating from 5 stars to 3. When the iron power cord is dangling off the edge of your tabletop this solder station will tip over; there's not enough counter weight i nthe base of it to keep is stable. Further, the opening of the solder iron holder is not ""smooth""; there's a ledge in there that always catches the ledge on my soldering iron. This isn't conducive to working fast; everytime I go to holster my soldering iron it takes me several tries to holster it. Very frustrating... I'm looking for a different base station."
2,hate it,I bought this grill a while back. It does the job but burns the food more often than it should. It's hard to control the temperature and doesn't leave grill marks like a cast iron grill would. The next grill will be a cast iron grill. Stainless steel is overrated!
1,This is a dud if you want to sit.,"I tried this product because I REALLY needed a place to sit down every 200 yards or so. For me, this product was not helpful in any way. This would be ok for a very lightweight person for an occassional use...but for everyday serious help I would not recommend it. In my experience it just doesn't fill the bill."
5,A real winner!,"I ordered this for my brother after he had a horrible experience with back surgery. He had to return to work, new construction sites, and was still in pain and worried about being able to walk through the large buildings. He didn't really want it, thought it would be silly. He has now thanked me several times! There is no seating on a job site and being able to get off his feet for a few minutes makes all the difference. Thanks"
3,The Hoaxes Are a Bit Average but Interesting Unknown Facts,"I seriously doubt any of the hoaxes in this book would ever fool even the most dimwitted of teachers, especially since the next page of the book is on the back of each hoax which you're supposed to cut out and make look like really old paper. The reason to buy this book lies in the true historical facts which are laid out in an easy to read format and style. The inclusion of an And This is Just Weird paragraph on each topic makes really enjoyable reading. An excellent book to introduce anyone to historical facts."
4,entertaining adventure films of the 50s,"Speaking of the film, 'Baaz' is one of the most entertaining adventure films of the 50s. However, some may feel that it's a little too anti-Portuguese. While it moves at a very fast pace, it does not feel rushed. On the technical side it does not disappoint, especially the brilliant cinematography deserves special mention. The songs are very pleasant (but it's funny how uninvolved the extras look in the song sequences as they mouth the lyrics like zombies) and the choreography is mostly dazzling (for the fight scenes and the dances)."
2,Average,I Liked Cypress Hill more when they first came out.There First Album is still their Best as far as I'm Concearned.the Problem with this Disc&much of their Music is that they only Mainly talk about Weed.They Have Talent but it gets to be a One Trick Pony after a while.Insane&I wanna get high are still the cuts.
4,the best one,"ok lets c all of the tracks r gr8, it was gr8, everything was gr8.....must have!!!!!!!! way better than IV"
5,"What are you lookin at reviews for, get this CD already!","What can be said? Nothing really. I mean, do I have to explain why this CD is so great? Do I really need to tell you how awesome DJ Mugg's production is - EVEN to this day? I'm gonna be listening to this CD even when I'm 80 years old, I don't care!!Standout tracks: Just listen to the whole thing. DJ Mugg's is a legend and strangely enough B-real's high pitched voice fits in perfectly over the dark grimy beats. If I was a criminal, this is what I would listen to before I go do a ""job"""
5,THIS WAS THE BEST HIP HOP DISC I'VE HERD IN A LONG TIME,THIS DISC IS A MUST FOR ANY HILL FAN AND THE LYRICS ARE GREAT! I LOVE IT AND I GARINTEE YOU WILL TO!
5,"The CD kicks it is the best ,rap rocks!","the cd is very cool my favorite is ""Insane in the Membrane""it rocks!"
5,Love the ending,"I just completed this game, I played it twice because ending B left me longing for more so I tried for the A ending, and wow I'm surprised, so much drama I loved it. Hoping for a sequel, if you read the reviews on this site you will notice how different this game is, I wish I would have bought this game when it came out in 2000, it's 2005 now, I truly regret not buying it, this game is amazing, so amazing I rank it up there in my list 1.Xenogears 2.Final Fantasy Tactics(tie)Valkyrie Profile 3.Chrono Cross. If your tired of the same boring stuff like the Final Fantasy Series I suggest you get this game, it has a good storyline which the FFS (except FF3)lack. Like Xenogears this game will become an underground classic beloved by those who have it and played it."
4,An entertaining and enjoyable game.,"I was skeptical of the side scrolling RPG when I got it, but it proved to be a great game. I played through it several times before finally stopping to try another video game. The battle concept is great, but a little hard to get the best result (mashing the control pad usually won the battles, but not with all the treasure and bonus EXP). The plot was nice, but a little thin. The focus seemed more on getting characters and leveling up. Very little character interaction (unless you working on the best ending). Overall, a good buy."
5,A great and fun game,"Valkyrie Profile is a very good game. It kind of reminds me of Saga Frontier 2. It is kind of cool being different people such as gods. It has a little bit of the animation in Legend of Mana an Saga Frontier 2. The battle system is very fun. There are 3 modes Easy, Normal, and Hard.I suggest you start out with normal or easy.When I first herd of it I thought it would be a rip off but then I heard that it was great.It is cool playing a mythologal gods. The beginning is kind of boring because there is a lot of talking. But that brings the story along. This game is great. If you are looking for a good RPG think of this one."
4,If you wish to own it wait,It will be rereleased on the psp and will have a sequel on a console system. Though they have not been announced in the states it may be better to wait and see instead of shelling out $100 for a used copy of the PS edition. It is by all means one of the best PS1 games and should be atleast tried by all rpg fans
4,fiction,"Good commentary on how society worked (works?), but I like the Royal books better. I get tired of that policeman!"
3,Murphy detective series,"Enjoyed the first book of the series very much - 4 stars, but as the series progressed, so did the swearing. If I want to hear those words, I can go to my local jr. high. I didn't read the 4th book or beyond."
3,Enjoyable quick read,"Again, a story that keeps moving and shows glimpses of turn of the century life. I enjoy the incorporation of historical figures and events. I would like to see Molly stop second-guessing herself ...we all do occassionally but Molly does in every chapter."
1,Piece of Junk!,"Although this is my first wireless, the picture is terrible.It flickers like the trackings bad on a tape, so theres a huge line that runs through the picture.The sound is bad,its a loud buzzing noise.The picture is ok on a tube tv but not a high resolution.The only good thing is the nightvision.But all in all I wish I woulda saved up for a good one.This camera is worthless!"
2,Too much interference for me.,"I ended up having to return this product because I was never able to get the camera more than about 5 feet away from the receiver before the interference (in the form of intermittent lines) ruined its usefulness. I never was able to pin down the source of the interference, though. I was hoping to use it with software that detected motion, but the interference was detected AS motion, and triggered a lot of false recordings. Directly connected, it worked fine, but then why buy it with the wireless capability?Sorry."
3,Good book is overpriced,"This slim volume examines the intellectual and political role of theories of ""ethnogenesis"" in nationalist ideology in the USSR and its successor states. The author opens with a lucid account of the general theory of ethnogenesis, as developed in the USSR, and proceeds to a case study involving two ethnic groups, now supposedly distinct, arguing over who is the true heir of posited ancestors. Shnirelman demonstrates that current ethnic movements in the former USSR are incomprehensible without an understanding of their development in the twentieth century.His Orwellian account of Tatar historiography would be stronger with a longer discussion, but his account is worth reading. If issued as an inexpensive paperback, it would be a nice supplement to undergraduate and graduate classrooms."

3,Steinbeck,Book arrived promptly. Enjoyed reading about the Sea of Cortez as it was years ago. Steinbeck writes so well!
1,Use your own judgement.,"I didn't have any luck with this product. BUT the seller took care of me promptly and without any static. I give the seller five stars for sure!If you do buy this, you can rest assured you're not going to get hosed. You'll be taken care of. And really, the one I got may have just been the one bum unit?"
4,For the applied mathematicians and engineers!,A very useful book to the students both in applied mathematics dept. and engineering college who are interested in computation based on finite field.
1,Misleading product,Is this a joke???? I did not closed this purchase since the vendor was showing an image of a different product than the one he really is selling. I had to cancel everything and go elsewhere to get my wrist dive computerIt is my first bad experience and hope it will never happen againJuan M
5,Work great!,"While these are recommended for Bose speakers (smaller than my Yamaha speakers) these brackets have no problem holding onto my larger speakers. They come with numerous mounting options for the speaker, and even more options for putting them on the wall or ceiling. I had to mount some speakers on a drywall only wall - no studs - and these mounts came with the hardware to do it. They have removable extensions so you can have them come off the wall 2"" or 6"" (roughly). These are great, strong, and a great deal. Read the other reviews. My surround sound system is: Yamaha NS-P1600 (Amzn's reseller here is bad at shipping (it is not Amzn selling them), so buy elsewhere). Buy you can check out the specs to see my speakers' size and compare to yours."
4,Installation is straight forward and does what it should,The mounting kit is easy to install and works pretty well. It does sag a little even though the speakers I have are the small Bose speakers. I guess coz I installed it on the side (wall) instead of coming down from the ceiling.Overall I am happy with it.
4,Functional and Affordable,This was a nice find. Speaker mounts tend to be either pricey or cheaply made. This was a nice set of sturdy mounts that were a good fit for my Samsung surround-sound speakers. They were easy to mount and flexible to put into the correct position desired. Price was very affordable as well.
4,VANTAGE POINT SAT SPEAKER MOUNTS,"I used these mounts with the Energy Micro speakers, with a wall mount application and while you have to purchase 2-1/4-20 x 1-1/2""L screws to mounts the speakers to the bracket, they did what I expected them to do and gave me flexibility to adjust them how I needed. These are all plastic and not heavy duty, so I would be hesitant to use them with anything larger than the Micros."
5,Decent Speaker Bracket for the money,"I bought these to mount a Paradigm Cinema series in the basement. They did a solid job. I wouldn't recommend them if you continuously make adjustments in the speaker position (loosening and tightening the set screws). The set screws will eventually wear out. Otherwise, if you need to set it up, adjust a few times then forget it, these are an excellent value. I wouldn't recommend any speakers over 5 lbs. (they say 8 max) because I think the set screws might have problems being durable. My Cinema's are 3.5 lbs and it works perfect. Highly recommended for the price"
5,It works - plain and simple,Includes everything you could ever need to mount to a small bookshelf speaker and get it mounted into the wall. Been sturdy for the past year without any issue. Can't go wrong with this!
4,a good fishing vest,"I like to walk around the reservoir sometimes and fish different spots, using different leaders and lures. I'm not a fly fisherman so I can't say if this vest has everything you need for that. For the bass and trout fishing I do this vest works fine at a great price. The big pockets at the bottom will easily hold a Plano 3500 utility box. One review said the zippers opened up too big, I don't agree. They run around two sides of the big pockets so getting the utility boxes in and out are a snap. Well designed, I think. Includes basic loop and velcro that will hold your rod while you change tackle or take the hook out. Finally, the fit is 'relaxed' so it can be worn over jackets in the early season."
1,Review of Redington Clark Mesh Fishing Vest,"I bought this a few months ago, and have used it quite a bit. It has some problems:1. The zippers go across the top of the pockets, and then go down the side. This makes things fall out of the pockets.2. Unlike other mesh vests, this one has only one layer of mesh, so you can't access or store things between the layers of mesh. Mesh fishing vests should be made with two layers of mesh and then be provided with long access zipper.3. There is not enough mesh and too much cloth, making it heavy and difficult to dry.4. After a short while, the zipper on one of the pockets stopped working, leaving the pocket open and the things falling out.5. There is very little storage space, compared to other vests of the same price.The design of this vest is very poor, with little consideration for the needs of folks like me who wear it. Also, the workmanship and materials are bad.Now I have to go to the trouble of figuring out how I send it back."
3,Decent Vest -- difficult zippers,"I purchased this vest based on the prior reviews it had received. I agree with these other reviews, the vest is very light weight, it dries very quickly and the pockets are well placed. There were two complaints about this vest in prior reviews, the velcro and the zippers. I have not experienced any problems with the velcro yet although I have been using it for almost a month now (6 or 7 days of fishing). The zippers on the large pockets are difficult to use. They are small, they do not open or close easily, especially with one hand. In addition, the opening for those large pockets is so large that if your not paying attention when you open the zipper, you could easily lose all of the contents in the pocket because it will open up completely."
5,Great item,"The vest works great, it holds my lures carrying case, and various sundry items. Dries quickly, a great item at a great price!!!"
5,"Sturdy, bright, many uses","My grandson had this toy and played with it consistently, so I purchased it for my nephew. Very versatile, can last through several stages of learning. It's bright and colorful, attractive to little ones. Can be used for identifying animals, counting, expectation,sequence, fine motor development. Would definitely recommend this toy."
2,No Sounds,I remember playing with these toys as a child and thought it would be fun for my daughter as well. The reason I gave it a low rating is that it does not make any sounds. I almost thought it was broken and was looking for a battery area when I realized there is no sounds and all the toy does is pop up quietly. I remember the Sesame Street version and each character said a little saying when it popped up and this toy does not do that.
3,"Ok, not great","Our daughter is just about too old for this now, but she never did play with this much. I think that is because the switches are too hard for her to push. She can push the button in he middle, but just can't do the other ones by herself. If I push all the switches and pop up the animals for her she loves pushing them back down though. Maybe if it got a lot of use they would be easier to push."
5,Entertaining & Educational,"My 4 year old son with Autism loves this toy. I love that it allows him to practice fine motor skills and that I can use it to teach him several types of things: colors, numbers, animals and actions. This toy certainly takes a beating around here but it remains in one piece. Excellent value!"
4,Everything I expected!,This toy reminds me of my childhood. I cant wait to see my son play with this on Christmas morning!
2,Defective Waste of Money,This toy is like one I had as a child which is what made me buy it to begin with. I like toys like this but this particular model is defective. The key that you have to turn to make the middle animal pop up is messed up on these. You can't close the lid again until you fiddle with the key and get it in the exact right position. It is tricky and little kids can't get the hang of it. This really upsets my daughter so I through this away. It wasn't just mine either. I have seen others that do it and read about it on other reviews.
3,Opportunity Cost Too High,"When I spend over $30 for a toy, I expect it to catch the attention of our daughter for more than a few minutes. She does like to slam closed the ""trap doors"" that the pals bop out of... but she is very quickly on to other toys. Sometimes the doors don't stay closed and it seems to frustrate her. Just not one of my favorites so far."
5,"Very Cute, Teaches Puzzle Solving Skills","My 17-month-old has had this toy since last Christmas (almost a year ago) and still enjoys it. She is just now understanding how to open each 'pal', but even when she couldn't, she enjoyed watching me open them for her and she would close them to squeals of delight. This toy is very durable, it has been thrown, dropped, even stepped on, and we have had no issues. It's also nice that it has a little handle, making it an easy toy to take over to grandma's to play. It's also a very quiet toy, and we all know that as parents we could ALL use more of those!"
5,Good Fun!!,This toy it's great. It got here fast and my toddler loves it. The Colors of the toy vary but it doesn't make a difference for my tot. It's fun and it doesn't require batteries. It's durable my son throws it on the floor and it hasn't cracked. My son has trouble making the monkey pop up but overall it's a good toy to have.
3,its an ok toy,i was a little disappointed with this toy. I remember having something like it when i was little but i don't remember it being so difficult to maneuver. only one button is easy to push. the other 4 are more complicated and my toddler has a hard time popping the toys out. usually i make the animals pop out and he pushes them back in which is much easier to do. I also find the toy very loud and unsettling. each time an animal pops out there is this big bang. I dont like noisy toys and this kind of gets on my nerves. my son doesnt seem to like it too much either. I think if it wasn't so startling each time it pops he would enjoy it much more.the concept is great and it is durable and has educational value (teaches hand coordination) which is why i still gave it 3 stars.
3,"Fun for a minute, but that is about it","This is a cute toy. It is a lot of fun for a few months, and then not so much. I found it was hard to find the age that my son wasn't either too young, or too old for it.I would say he really got the most use out of it around 18-20 months maybe. But, even then he would only play with it a few times a week.This is one of those old school ""must have"" kind of first kids toy, but nothing that really knocks your socks off. At least it doesn't make a lot of noise. ;)"
2,I wouldn't buy it if I could do it over,"This was a disappointing purchase. It really isn't all that interesting after the first couple of minutes. My child didn't seem very interested after our initial play session with it. If I had it to do over, I would pass on this."
3,DIfficult,I bought this for my 17 month old daughter. The buttons are difficult to move. She likes it but gets very frustrated when she can't make the animals pop up. They should make it easier for such small children. It is sometimes hard for me to open the little compartments.
2,Pop up too dull for my boy,We bought this for our son's 1st Birthday. He's quite the energetic guy so this really did little for him. At first he was curious how it worked and then lost all interest quickly after. Not a big loss though as it was cheap.
2,Hard to Use for Toddlers,"This toy was given to my 10-month old. He is now 19 months and still cannot make three of the animals pop up (giraffe, lion, and monkey). I can do it myself, but it's difficult and hurts my fingers. The toy is frustrating for him. Maybe some of these toys are stiffer than others, but I wanted to share our experience."
3,An OK toy.,I bought this toy for my 8 month old son. He quickly figured out that push button pops out an animal and was quite happy with it. He is almost 13 months now. However even now he is only able to open only the center animal with the push button (the easiest to operate). Though we have demonstrated to him several times the other buttons and he tries - the other buttons are quite hard to operate/move for a child his age. I am hoping he will soon become strong enough to open the others on his own. Right now he just enjoys himself closing all the pop outs that I open for him. The product is slightly on the heavier side and sometimes hurts the child when they drop it on their foot while carrying it and walking. These are primarily the reasons for my 3 star review.
3,Too difficult to trigger the pop ups,"I purchased this for my daughter at seven months thinking it would be fun and help her learn object permanence, but she wasn't strong enough to trigger the levers and switches that make the animals pop up! Very frustrating for both of us. She hasn't played with it at all. Is now nine months and shows little interest in it. It would be perfect if the levers were hair triggered instead of requiring so much force. Might work for older kids,time will tell, but I think they have missed the mark for the ideal age for it to work as a developmental/educational toy.Update: little one is now one year old and enjoys pushing the doors down once I've popped them up. She can get the middle one ( the button) to work on her own, the others are still too stiff. I have noticed that with use they seem to become easier to use, so maybe getting a used one would have been a better idea!"
3,Buttons are VERY hard to push,"We received this as a gift, but my 18 month old twins can hardly push the buttons down! They are VERY stiff (and I mean stiff as in hard for me to push sometimes). The base color of our popper is blue. I have a friends with a different model and their buttons are much easier to push. I'd recommend buying this toy in a store where you can test it. I think the ease varies by model."
2,Very Difficult Toy,"My daughter LOVES this toy. However the buttons are so diffcult to move that it frustrates her. I dont know of any baby strong enough to push the buttons. It needs to be easier for a baby to use. My daughter is constantly asking me to ""help"" her push the buttons and wants to be able to push them herself."
3,Great for slightly older babies,"My one-year-old loves it when I push the buttons and knobs to make the animals pop up, but her little fingers are not yet strong enough to do it herself."
4,Good for motor skills,My son is 13 months old and can make all of the animals pop up except for the lion. He will play with this toy for a little while but eventually moves on. He enjoyed it the most when he was learning how to use it because I would give him praise each time he learned a new one. Now that he has mastered it (but one lever) he doesnt play with it much. I do think that it helped develop his fine motor skills though. A good learning toy that helps babies learn to use their hands.
4,Fun for 16 month old surprised me,My toddler seeks out similar toys at play spaces and when we visit friends so I decided to purchase. I figured she'd lose interest since it seems geared a bit younger. She loves it. The handle lets her tote it around the house. She can manage all but 2 of the switches with ease and loves naming the animals as they pop up. I don't expect her to love it for long but at this price I'm OK with that. I'll donate/resell when she's done.
5,Great for babies!,"I love this toy! There are many similar toys out there, but this one has more options and is more interactive. Instead of just pressing a button to have the ""pal"" pop open you can slide a lever, turn a key, push a lever down, turn a button, and push a button down. My little one squeals with delight when the different animals pop up. He isn't the best and knowing how to turn, push, slide, etc, so my husband and I help him. He does love pushing the ""pals"" closed, he gets a big kick out of it. I love playing with this toy, it is fun to have something we can do together even though he is young (9 months)."
5,Hard to find classic,This pop up toy has been a hit with children for years. I looked all over before finding it here. Great toy and good price.
4,"simple, classic toy","My 17 month old loves this toy and claps and cheers when the lids pop open. Yes, some of the buttons are hard for her, but she will get it, and still loves it even if momma has to help some. She carries it around and brings it to me over and over throughout the day."
5,My Daughter Love This Sturdy Toy,"We've had this toy for over a year, and my daughter has enjoyed it from 6 months to 18 months. At first she loved to push down the animals, but now she can (and does frequently) pop them up. My parents have a similar toy of a different brand that is not nearly as well designed as this toy. The pieces fit together well, and the casing is sturdy enough for reasonable usage. If my daughter banged the whole thing against the floor by the handle, she could eventually break it, I guess, but why would she do that when she's busy flipping knobs?The color of our toy is different from the one picture here, but it's similar enough that I don't feel misled. My biggest complaint is that some of the knobs have actions that aren't intuitive--it's not obvious whether to pull or twist one of them. My daughter did eventually figure them all out and can work them now."
3,Classic toy,Classic toy. I remember having one of these when I was a kid. It was a blast! You can use it as a catapult!Definitely will entertain for hours.
4,works well,The mechanics of it work well. It keeps my little ones attention for at least a little while. Mostly I make them go up and he enjoys slaping the mess out of them to make them go back. The stickers are pealing off already after a few weeks of play.
2,Needs too much strength,"It seems that someone is going around and down-voting all of the negative reviews of this product, no matter how clearly written or factual. If you read through them, though, you will see the same opinions expressed again and again:First, the Amazon price is way too high. You can find this toy in most big box retailers for around $12-15.Second, the buttons are very stiff and hard for young toddlers to use.This was our experience too. Our baby liked seeing the animals pop up, and she figured out how each lever or knob or button was supposed to work; she just wasn't strong enough to make it happen. You really have to have some strong fingers to use this toy.Since doing the right thing doesn't work, the educational value is nil. Baby can only play with it if we help her push the buttons, which defeats the whole point of exploring and playing."
5,great toy,My son loves this toy. He played with it around 8-9 months and still enjoys it at 14 months.
4,Great Learning Tool,"My son loved this around 12 months old. It was great for him to learn how to manipulate the different kinds of switches, buttons and knobs. It took him a while to figure out the knob that turns. That one proved annoying for me as well because the knob has to be turned just right for the pop-up animal to latch closed again. The toy is extremely durable; my son likes to throw things down the stairs and this is one of the items that has been down them. It doesn't require batteries and doesn't make sounds/music. I rated it a 4 because my son prefers the sound/music toys so he played with this one less frequently than others."
4,classic toy,"Classic toy- love that the doors can only be opened by using the knobs and that it does not take batteries! My daughter and I will use the toy to learn animal sounds, colors, numbers and operating the various knobs. I just wish I knew a good sound to make for the giraffe!"
3,Could've been easier to work,"Somebody bought this toy for my daughter's 1st birthday (only it's yellow, not white). It's an okay toy, but the switches and knobs are really hard to push/turn. She is only able to get the blue #3 animal to pop since the button is easy to push. The one that looks like a key is hard to turn, and if you turn it and the animal pops up, you have to turn the key more to get the lid to close. The other switches are really hard to push/pull. My daughter tries to push the other buttons, but it takes a lot of strength to push them."
1,"White one with red, yellow, and blue doors and buttons Recalled!!!",Please stop using this toy immediately and call 1800-752-9755 or visit visit the hasbro.com website customer service/recall/playskool busy poppin pals.
4,Didn't Last.,"My 1-year old loved playing with this and trying to push or turn the pieces in the right way to get the figures to pop up and sing. But after 2 months, two of the five figures no longer sing the song when they pop up."
1,WHY SO EXPENSIVE?,"It's $18 at Babies R Us, why is it double the cost? I really need to start price comparing more"
1,RECALLED,I just thought I would alert anyone possibly interested in this toy to double check that this hasn't been recalled! I believe this one and the Sesame Street themed one have been recalled.
1,wasn't impressed,basic toy that has been around since probably my mother was small. last for maybe a few months till their sick of it and it ends up in the toy pile.
2,"nothing special, not going to thicken hair!","i have super thin hair due to unknown reasons, so I decided to try this product after my aunt used the regular shampoo & conditioner (and she has curly thick hair, i have curly thin hair). I've been using for more than 6 months, and i can't say that it has done anything to thicken my hair or even make it seem thicker. it smells good, washes good, and lasts a long time, but if your looking for thickening, don't waste your time. ON THE THE NEXT ONE!"
3,Older Version Better,"I purchased this product for the Bridge game and haven't really used it that much so far; however, what I have played, I like the older version better."
5,PUMA FOREVER!,Besides Adidas originals these are the only brand of sneaker i will ever wear! and I have been wearing GV since the 80's!!GV is a timeless classic and i love it!!
4,Old fashioned-classic sneakers,This sneakers are great. They remind me my time at school. Good quality overall and great looks. Very confortable for walking or sports.
5,Mind Blowing...... Simply Great!!,"This book is truly a work of art. The plot, the characters, the similes, and the quotes are superb. The story is about Jay Gatsby,the man who did everything to achieve love. But he still failed. The theme is illusion. This is a great classic which reflects upon the lives of American people. It is not at all slow and boring. U will definitly enjoy this book. Mark my words"
5,LOVE IT!!!!,This is a very unique gift and it is relaxing to watch the shrimp swim around in their enclosed sphere. LOVE IT!!!!
1,Flimsy and almost impossible to put together.,"Just not at all like the picture. We cannot even use it, had to throw it away. Very disappointing."
3,Nice,"I like this rattle alot. I was so sick of all the loud, obnoxious, ugly rattles and teethers at walmart and target, and this one was refreshing and very cute. My baby is too young to play with it yet, but Im sure shell love it. Nice quality."
2,cheaply made,"these clothes are pretty cheaply made, which i guess should not really have been a surprise. the thing i did not like the most was the tags are super stiff and scratchy, like they are made of plastic or something."
2,Wizard: I Still Don't Know Who Tesla Really Was,"I was hoping this book would have delved into Tesla's inventions more thoroughly. I was very disappointed in this aspect of the book. The author totally glossed over the Niagara Falls project, which was a major part of Tesla's contribution to electrical distribution. The book spends too much time on Tesla's failed business dealings and with all the secondary people that he seemingly had contact with throughout his life. The organization of the book also is disconcerting at times. You finish one paragraph and then the next paragraph is about a completely different subject, person, topic, etc. with absolutely no transition or introduction.I expected more from this book. I feel I still don't know who Tesla was or what exactly his inventions were and for a project that took 20 years of the author's life, it is still lacking in important details."
3,"Change the title to ""Men of Electricity""","This book was not devoted to the life of Nikola Tesla. In addition to Tesla's life, the book contained a brief (and often irrelevant)biography of the many men and women who lived in Tesla's time. Scientist/historians would probably find the technical information in this book interesting."
4,Good Profile,"This is a well written piece of work by Seifer. It is not as detailed an autobiography as say Cheney's ""Tesla: Man Out of Time"" but if offers many other aspects that other works do not. What is most beneficial about this read is that the author is a professor of psychology as well as a handwriting expert. This allows him to analyze the habits, writings, and many other idiosyncrasies about Tesla. Another plus is it goes more into detail about Tesla's work than other biographies. A very worthwhile read for future engineers like myself, historians, or people interested in learning more about where many of the devices we use all the time today originated."
2,Could be better,"The book was a nice overview of Tesla's life and accomplishments and painted an interesting portrait of the inventor, but was unfortunately riddled with the authors own pseudo-scientific views. The book would have been substantially strengthened if he had focused on Teslas actual accomplishments rather than hypothesizing about his ability to read minds & other bits of new age babble. I'd recommend picking another book if you're interested in the inventor."
4,Fantastically detailed account of a modern day marvel,"Extremely insightful voyage into the life of Nikola Tesla. Completed with relevant accounts of the man and the people that knew him. While remaining packed with information, there are periods of this recollection that are dry. This is not a book that can be read start to finish it is to be read more like marathon. Overall a fantastic read none the less."
3,"Good content, Bad binding","My opinion is that this booksheds much light on the oft-passed-over mysteries of the life and times of Tesla. No doubt his genius altered human history. I enjoyed Cheneys book perhaps more, but I learned more with the Seifer book. Seifer is maybe just a slight bit critical in a spot or two, but Cheney was overpoweringly non-critical.Before I completed the third chapter, the binding began to release pages. Not just in chunks, but many pages individually. I am careful with books, and my library houses many titles from the mid 1800's, in good condition and in my possesion for all my life. When I buy a book, I sign my name in the front and plan to keep the good ones until I die. I was very disappointed that this book was so poorly constructed to fall apart as if it were disposable.5 stars to Seifer2 stars to Citadel PressDC"
3,An OK Read,"I found the book to be of some interest. It definitely goes into EXCRUCIATING detail in covering Tesla's life story. But the detail becomes overwhelming after a while. I never found any ""must turn the page to find out what happened"" sections of the book. Many portions deal with business ventures with third or fourth parties that are so convoluted, I kept loosing track of the purpose for the section I was reading. And as an engineer, I kept looking for at least some detail that gave insight into what truly unique feature his inventions had. There is no question that on a broad scale he was a genius. But what specific detail set him apart is missimng."
2,"interesting book, yet muddled","This book's strongest suit is its history of Tesla's business dealings, and his meetings with other famous individuals of his era. The author obviously conducted a great deal of research. On the other hand, I found myself wishing for a clearer explanation of which of Tesla's ideas were clearly scientific advances, and which were fantasy or unworkable. Unfortunately, the author sometimes discusses his own belief in ESP and other pseudoscience, which calls into question his overall credibility."
3,I Was Hoping For Better,"While this book takes the reader from Tesla's childhood through his death, it doesn't present the information in an interesting way. Tesla was one of the most interesting figures of the turn of the century, but this book fails to convey that. The author goes from blind adoration for Tesla seeming to credit him with every invention since the 1890's to mild disdain. The author's writing style is pretentious - how many times can you use the word proboscis instead of nose? He also likes to throw in psycho-babble that adds little to the narrative. He fails to address many of the rumors and odd stories that surround Tesla. Too much of the author comes through in this book and not enough of Tesla. I would look elsewhere for a biography on Tesla."
5,ONE OF THE BEST X-BOOKS I'VE EVER READ!,"Well, I wasn't sure what to expect when I first spotted this book, but the great Steranko cover sure caught my attention, and I knew that Michael Jan Friedman certainly knew his way around the STAR TREK universe. But after reading it, I can definitely say it's a great book! Alien invasions, superheroics, and the guy who crippled Professor X in the first place? Outstanding work all around!"
2,Weak Characterization,"The X-Men rely on good characterization. The author of the book does a poor job of showing the characters that many fans know in depth. The characters are written as if the author only knew a few aspects of those characters and reiterates it numerous times throughout the book. It begins to get very repetitive, and does not hold the reader's interest."
1,Waaaay too fluffy,"This is an okay story by itself, but Friedman writes as though he's talking to an audience of autistic 12-year-olds. If you skip every third paragraph, you'd get the same story and eliminate some of the tiresome and repetitive verbosity.And WHERE THE HELL IS WOLVERINE? Does Friedman think he can ignore the existence of major X-Men characters? Not even mention them?All in all, I'd tell you to skip this book and look to the new Batman: No Man's Land novelization by Greg Rucka for entertaining superhero fiction."
5,"if you loved vintage x-men, you'll like this!","a novel for professor x fans and fans of classic x-men, featuring core team members and ultracool steranko cover...friedman is an old hand at star trek and knows his way around the marvel universe...not fannish , not voguish, but solid story-telling from a pro"
2,What...is going on?,"This was an amusing read, but not one I would really impose on others; the simple problem is that the characters spend too much time reminiscing about past battles than doing anything. This book would have been much better if it was about 100 pages shorter. If you aren't a fan of the X-men with a good deal of back ground knowledge, you won't have a clue what's going on. If you are a big fan of the X-men, then by all means, go ahead and read this, but if not, don't waste your time...."
5,Oldies but Goodies,"This is a very good X-Men novel, even if it may not be what current fans are expecting. It revolves mainly around Professor Xavier, not focusing nearly as much on his band of superhero mutants. The plot was predictible, with only one notable twist in the entire story, but it was enjoyable none-the-less. Even the X-Team in the book is not who was expected, as it reunites the five original X-Men who have not worked together in quite some time. It is a joy to read, , however, making it a staple in any fans collection."
1,A waste of money. Do NOT buy,"This dvd was an utter waste of money. After reading the description and then seeing the dvd I could have thought that I received the wrong dvd. There is about 15 minutes of actual puppy/clicker interaction on the dvd. The rest is fluff, filler and advertisements and it appears to be a home made production.Surely there must be something better on the market than this. The ""bonus"" tracks take up 80% of the dvd and they have almost nothing to do with clicker training of dogs. There is even a rabbit training included!A huge disappointment."
2,nothing extraordinary,I did not learn much I did not already know. If you have read even a very short book on the subject you will have covered all of the information in this DVD.
1,More of a product advertisement than an instructional video,"The video basically shows that clicking works, but there's no instruction on how to actually do the training. It's a VERY short video on kids playing with puppies and an ADVERTISEMENT for the website and products.Bottom line: It's a total waste of money and should be labeled as an advertisement."
2,"Good idea, bad execution","The idea of this DVD is great. Showing how you can clicker train a puppy, and that it is so easy, even a kid can do it. For the most part, the DVD achieves that goal, but some poorly chosen footage, and kids who need to be clicker trained ruin the disc. This looks like something that I could have produced with a DV video camera, and DVD authoring software. It shows some good tips, but overall misses the mark."
5,"A delightful introduction to fun, effective and safe puppy training","I use this video frequently to introduce individuals and families with children to the fun of using a clicker to train a puppy. Children enjoy watching the cute puppies and parents can see how easy and safe the methods are. Viewers can see the communication that quickly develops between the puppies and the child trainers. The footage clearly shows how successful the children can be in a very short amount of time. The DVD comes with a printed supplement that gives important instructions on proper use of the clicker to train a pup. The bonus clips on the DVD include among others, more training tips and a useful segment on the basics of dog body language called ""Speak Dog"". I show this segment when doing dog bite prevention education sessions with children and their parents. I am a professional dog trainer and behavior consultant and I find this DVD to be top notch."
2,I cautiously recommend this book,"I would only cautiously recommend this book. Having read portions of both ""Destructive Generation"" and ""Radical Son"", I believe that this work is mostly a recitation of those. What I would heartily recommend is the introduction. It is excellent."
4,Brilliant Points -- Should be Catholic,"Make some excellent observations, e.g., conservatives in America are not right wing, we were started by a revolution by the way. The revolutionary thoughts of the 18th century were opposite, liberty vs. egalitarianism. Explores why leftist feel they need to help everyone. A lot of his observations can be taken right from Papal documents (esp. on socialism) and I am trying to get him to convert."
2,A little bit short,"I was quite disappointed with this book. I expected a good analysis of leftist thought and its contradictions. I didn't find it. Horowitz thesis is: marxist experience failed, today's left radical thought stem from Marxist roots, so it has been proven wrong by history and lef radicals are enemies of freedom. It is a little bit short. The only convincing chapter is when Horowitz shows how political correctness prevented the adoption of efficient measures at the beginning of AIDS epidemic."
1,How little has changed...,"In the old days, when Horowitz edited _Ramparts_, his workswere among the most fact-free and vitriolic on the left. Now that hehas moved to the right they seem to be the same.There are muchbetter right-wing authors to read: Frum, Bovard, Pinkerton, Podhoretz..."
1,Dishonest,This book is not worth reading because it merely employs the common conservative tactic of equating all progressive or left-wing thought to communism (or really to Stalinism). Just not a valid argument in any way.
4,the politics of poor research,"David Horowitz is an unqualified authority regarding true political issues. He has done a magnificant job of selling out to the right, making a small fortune along the way. Horowitz's weak convictions and clouded, platitudinal arguments are among the right's finest. What else would you expect from an uneducated hippie?"
1,homophobic and hateful,This book is homophobic and hateful. There is a reason 60 people want to sell it for a dollar.
2,so/so reading material,"This book was an impulse buy for me. I saw it wasn't expensive so I thought ""why not?"" Nothing really in depth about Buddhism. It was all pretty much just historical accounts of the religion. I was not sastified with it at all. Dry reading, not very interesting really. Look else where for a book on the Buddha's wisdom."
3,The history of Buddha - full of facts.,"For a history of Buddha, this book is excellent. Dates, names and cities are listed on almost every page. The pictures are colorful, brilliant and numerous. I enjoy reading a story, but this book was more historical than enjoyable for me. For a history project or for more information on the Buddha, I would recommend this, but for ""pleasure reading"", I would not."
4,A Very Good Book,"I wanted to give this book 5 stars, but there was a point in the book which I found too slow. Hey it could be me, but once I got past that point it turned into a very good book. Jazz and Alex were great together. The suspense of what had happened to her sister was also good. The only thing I don't like is I have to wait till next summer for the 2nd book. Can't wait."
4,Not bad,"At first the story is so thrilling that you'll want to read it in a sitting. As the story reveals the thrilling parts are less and less and the reading gets dull and boring. Then at the end the book starts again as it should be. I don't really know if I want to read another ""Bullet Catcher's"" book"
3,A passable read,"If you are looking for a light story to pass the time, this book can serve that purpose. No more no less. This is the first time I have read a book by Roxanne St. Claire and for me it will be the last. If you are looking for top of the line stories, try Nora Roberts, Linda Howard or Susan Elizabeth Phillips. These authors are really extraordinary writters."
2,Far Fetched,""" The Bullet Catchers"" is a decieving term for this book.I would not want this guy to protect my loved one because all he can think about is sex.I agree with one of the other reviews, check out Linda Howard.This book leaves much to be desired."
2,Not so much...,"Well, I was not very impressed with this book. Too many unexplained circumstances. No way in heck ""Jazz"" could pass as her twin to so many people her twin is close to.And the whole exported porn storyline? Not romantic to say the least.I wasn't impressed by the author's writing style, and there are way too many typos in the novel (she needs a better proof-reader). However, I was interested to see how the novel ended, so it did hold my attention to an extent.I don't think I will be buying more of St. Claire's books, though."
2,"Good concept, so-so execution","I agree with the author's premise and was looking forward to getting this book so that I could make the most of my home. Unfortunately, the examples tend to come from the Rich & Famous. The author name-drops and shows extremely expensive homes and furnishings. I'd like to see this author do the same kind of book showing solutions for ordinary American homes using typical American furnishings. I don't mean cheap. I just mean typical. If the author's answer is that the ideas can be ""translated"" easily to any budget or home, then why doesn't the author SHOW such translations?"
4,HEART OF TEXAS,"These Frommmer guides are very good, and this one on Austin and San Antonio is no different. I am very familiar with these two cities and I find the suggestions in this guide to be on the whole very accurate. Though the hotel and restaurant sections are top loaded with the most famous and expensive, some smaller properties and resturants are not included. The sites section however is perfect, the guides descriptions and ratings are close to perfect. What I really appreciate about the Frommer guides is that you really feel like they have researched the subject, granted that should be a prerequisite in a travel guide, but unfortunitely in my experience that is not always the case."
2,ok but???,Ok movie for it's time kind of a rip off of 1978 Piranha though but the asking price for this is just ridiculous for a movie like this...
3,OK for a reference.,"This is an OK book for reference. However the book is lacking in several areas. Material is not new -- but I really didn't expect it to be. However, there are some tips one may find helpful. If you have money to spend -- buy it -- if not there are plenty of other books that help with meeting management that are a better buy."
4,"Nice idea, not sure it was worth it","I bought this hoping it would help me paint my elaborate railing/banister in my 100 yr old home. I tried it out. I do not like the bristles, they are too slick and I don't think it holds the paint well. I think this brush would be best used painting the corners in a room, which might not be worth it because it's just another brush to wash out.I am giving it 4 stars because it doesn't hold as much paint as I like but the handle is very comfortable compared to a traditional brush. Also, there were no problems with the bristles falling out, which can be a big hassleI am considering this a novelty brush and I will stick to my Purdy paint brushes..."
3,this movie is very nice movie,"Ajay Verma is a major in the Indian army, and is principled, dedicated, and honest. His family has arranged his marriage with beautiful Sheetal, and both are to be married soon. Shortly before their marriage, Pakistan declares war and attacks India, and Ajay and all other soldiers are recalled to duty. Ajay meets with an old friend, Sunil, on the warfront. During a quiet break they talk about life at home, and Ajay's forthcoming marriage. Then Sunil is wounded, and brought in the barracks. Ajay goes through his belongings, and gets a shock when he sees Sheetal's photograph in Sunil's wallet."
3,CAT5????,Neither Amazon's listing nor Cable to Go's website say anything about this coupler being CAT5. There are a number of reviews that call this CAT5 but I don't see what they base this on. If you're using this for the ubiquitous 100BASE-TX Ethernet commonly found in homes and businesses I would stick with something that clearly indicates it is rated for CAT5 such asNEEWER Ethernet Connector Adapter Cable Coupler For RJ45 CAT5
5,Works Great!,"Moved my computer further from my modem and so needed a 30-ft cat5e cable. Found I had five (5) 7-ft cables and decided to purchase these connectors. Received order in less than one week, hooked the 5 cables together with 4 of these connectors and everything is working perfectly! I saved money -and- recycled the five cables I had on hand."
5,Does The Job,We used this for temporary hookup when connecting game system(s). Add 50' cable to existing connection to reach system(s). It avoids the work and mess of a running cable through walls.
3,did not work for gigabit,"It works as advertised and allows you to join 2 lengths of ethernet cable. However, in my case, it degraded the signal to an extent where it would not pass gigabit ethernet. I was attempting to join 2 lengths of cat6 cable that work fine seperately."
3,Cables to Go RJ45 8-pin Modular Inline Coupler,"The coupler works, but why did it take a month for it to get to me after I got an email saying that it was shipped?"
4,RJ45 (Cat5e) Coupler,Do you have 2 short ethernet cables? Do you need 1 longer ethernet cable? Then this is your cheap solution instead of buying another longer cable (which costs more money).Make sure to place in a stationary location away from high traffic zones with moving parts/people for best results.
5,"Yes, it's a Cat 5 Coupler","What can I say, it's a Cat 5 coupler, the plastic on both connectors holds the cable firmly, and it works. Nothing wrong with it than I can find.."
2,Check the Shipping,"If you're willing to wait two months or more to receive this tiny, super cheap item, then go for it. I, on the other hand, don't live in Timbuktu and won't wait for such an absurd length of time to receive an online order."
4,Decent product,"This is a fairly good product. Nothing to report on broken pins as of right now. You guys should make a wireless version of that though. I don't want to have to hook up my computer to a LAN cable all the time, I want to use it around the house. And you should make adapters for mobile phones too, so I can connect to the internet with mine."
1,"Pins 1 and 8 come disconnected, this is not an 8-pin coupler!","Be careful with this item, pins 1 and 8 come disconnected intentionally. You can clearly see in the receptacle that pins 1 and 8 are bended downward. This is a 6-pin coupler sold as an 8-pin coupler, unbelievable."
3,took more than 3 weeks to ship,"the product works, cheap (cost wise) and standard however the shipment came from Asia and it took more than 3 weeks"
1,Just buy OEM Honda,"Extremely noisy motor. Motor is weak on power, moves window very slowly. Glass does not sit level in frame."
3,supremes-marvelettes back to back,"Just a word of warning to those fans who think that this KTELcollection of Dominion re-records are the original recordings.THEY ARE NOT the originals, but new recordings made by ""theoriginal artist or one or more members of the original group.""If you're into remakes of the original Motown hits and don't minda replacement singer for Diana, Jean, Wanda or Gladys, then enjoythis album.If not, save your money!"
5,My feet love these...,"I've worn these since high school. Now they're the rage again... Go figure.If I'm not already wearing these, I keep a pair of these in a zipper bag with me at all times. They fold flat,and weigh next to nothing. I throw them right into my tote bag, or glove compartment. A definite lifesaver on those days when your feet are killing you, or you don't want to ruin the back of your expensive heels driving.To reply to the comment on not wearing these outside...I have news for you, lol. I've worn them outside for, forever...Even though they're soft, they're pretty tough.Just don't wear them in the rain or snow, that's all.I love mine. They're comfy, and they make me smile.They're a staple..."
3,No rubber sole,"I didn't remember reading anywhere that the shoe was suede material throughout including the sole. It wasn't exactly the ideal footwear for outdoors, which is what I was intending on using it for. I still loved the style and fit of the shoe. I just wish that they sold that same style with a hard rubber sole."
5,Great shoes,I have wanted a pair of moccasins for some time now & finding a pair without a sole was a priority. I love them! They fit perfect right from the box. I couldn't be happier.
5,Minnetonka moccasins boots,"These are well-made, traditional styling, terrific moccasins. I wear them when slopping around the house and they hold up really well (limit outdoor wear). In the classic, never-goes-out-of-style look, they really are comfortable, and complement just about anything you wear...from jeans to a mini skirt."
2,Dissapointed,Not hard soled!The sizing isn't accurate. Need to buy them a whole size smaller !but still Cute style
3,Don't care for the sole,"These were okay, I feel like they are more like house shoes. I bought another pair at Sears that were better quality. I don't care for the way these fit either. They are a little bigger on the foot than I like."
2,"I was sent a different shoe - a loafer moccasin, not a fringed boot","What I received is cute, fur lined, well sewn. it is true to size. I wear 9.5, and ordered 9 in these because the first pair really was WAY too long to be an accurate 9.5. These are snug, but think they will stretch. I have narrow feet and they are good. I did not yet contact the company about this error, so I cannot say as to how they would respond. They have a thin but firm man made sole. These will be good for keeping at work when I need to slip into something more comfortable or when I drive to work in my scrumptious ACORN chinchilla slippers and forget to bring a pair fo shoes to change into (happened once!) . Minnetonka makes very high quality products - the low score is for sending me the wrong model - not even anything close. The delivery is fast and they have good packing."
5,Nice mirrors,"Originally bought these mirrors for my Suzuki Marauder cruiser and needed the metric adapters, but they looked great and worked well. Traded bikes for a Victory Hammer cruiser and the mirrors got transferred. On the victory they did not need the adapters and they look just as good as they did on the Suzuki. Highly recommend the Kuryakyn mirrors. because they are well made and look great."
1,not again,"i got this expecting many things but the first time i tried it, it did not work. when i tried again, it only worked briefly before not recognizing my nintendo 64 system at all. too late to return, unbfortunately."
3,An attempt at everything,"This book attempts to detail every aspect of furniture making from plastic to metal to its main focus of wood. This is a English book so there are some unfamiliar terms but there are American equilivents. This book has the reader flipping back and forth to different pages looking at referenced pictures every other sentence and some reference numbers are annoyingly mixed up every so often. In my opnion, the author seems to gloss over some more advanced details in his very concise (miss on word and you miss the point) wording. Perhaps it was over my head after just one reading or perhaps I expected to much detail and he did not deliever as much as a book just on a niche subject would. This book needs to be read at least twice. A must have refference work - if you need some quick info on an obscure subject or problem, this book will usually deliver to all skill levels."
5,very good and detailed reference book,"This is an excellent book that covers all aspects of furniture making from the material selection, tools and thier use, to finishing and also some very detailed (at last) geometrical shape design and layout techniques - without the maths.Overall a must have for anyone serious about thei furnituremaking/cabinetmaking.However it is the exact same book as theThe Technique of Furniture Making- I have both and it is only the dimensions that slightly differ - BE AWARE"
2,Not useful to me,"I am sorry that this book does not seem very useful to me. This text is highly recommended by noted authorities in woodworking. Much of the information seems very dated. Other areas, such as descriptions of joints and specific types of dovetails seem to be too limited to be of use to a novice like myself. I feel I wasted money on this purchase and I wish I could see the value that much better craftsman than myself place on it."
3,A reasonable historical reference,"This book is good for reference and provides a broad look at the topic of furniture making. For an experienced woodworker, it may not be the best choice if you are looking for detail construction."
5,cornerstone of my woodworking library,"Whether you're a furniture maker or someone who wants to understand the quality of old world furniture making, you will gain an appreciation for the finer aspects of craftsmanship and construction and you will never look at another piece of furniture the same way again. No other book has left such a lasting impression on me."
2,Encyclopedia of Furniture Making,I would rate the book content as 5 stars. I am giving 2 stars for the vendor who rated the condition of the book as good condition. The back was cracked. The price was reasonable- I got what I paid for. Thanks
3,"A few highlights, but mostly filler...","He Is Legend boasts 'The Seduction' and a couple of other bands make a couple of decent attempts at rock/metal. It's mostly just worth the buy to get the Revolution Smile rarity not found on any other album. The song has a not so great production value compared to Above The Noise, which is sad really because it's a good song. Anyways, like I said, alot of filler, but if you're into nu-metal (and not very good nu-metal) which seems to have died out in the last few years, this may be your thing. 3 stars for He Is Legend, Revolution Smile, 32 Leaves."
1,Save your money,"This book may have some merits. It is easy to read or entertaining.But it is incorrect in so many places that I would not recommend it to anybody. It claims to make winners out of beginners and advanced players. Believe me, it has nothing for advanced players. Or even for intermediate player. The most severe errors in the book are in the odds calculation. The hand selection is questionable. I really regret buying this. There are many good books for beginners(Lee Jones' book for example). This is not one of them."
1,not so good,"I recently skimmed through this book at a local bookstore.It did not take long before I noticed a glaring error in the book. In situation #87 the board is AK929 and the player holds 98. The author goes on to say the player could lose to T9, J9 or Q9.This is a common beginner mistake. In fact, if an opponent held any of these hands the result would be a split pot. Both players would hold the five card hand AK999. The kicker card does not play.After reading this I immediately returned the book to the shelf. Any book that contains the above advice cannot possibly be good.Paul"
4,made a great gift,"My hubby recently discovered Texas Hold'em and loves it! I bought him this to help him understand the game better and he said it really does. It gives practical applications of various hands and what to do with them. He's happy, so I'm happy!"
5,Finally! An Illustrated Guide! His Strategies Work!,"I started playing poker seriously about 8 months ago, after just dabbling with friends and family. I'd read 4 other books and skimmed through a few others in preparation for my trips to Foxwoods and also on some online poker rooms. This is the only illustrated poker book I found, that is clear and concise and tells you what to do if you have certain hands!!! Many of the other poker books on Hold'em, are bogged down and not very easy to follow or learn from - or so was my opinion. The tips and advice in this book are already paying off for me - literally! I read it as soon as I got it a few weeks ago and Presto!! One thing is for sure, I'm more confident at a poker table than I was before I read Mr. Purdy's book! I recommend it to all. Thanks!! And Happy Winnings!"
4,A great LIMIT Texas hold em book,"I agree with most of the other reviewers and won't bother going into details that they have already covered but I want to make one new point. This book is geared to LIMIT hold em games, not pot limit or no limit. If you play limit, this book will probably improve your game. It did mine. If you play pot limit or no limit, the book may improve your starting hand play but there are better books out there for those types of hold em. When I bought the book I figured if it kept me from playing one bad hand, the book would pay for itself and I think it has."
2,"Very basic, and covers only LIMIT hold 'em","The illustrated concept is a good one, and makes the book a lot easier to read and use than most text-only books. However, there are two very important facts to know about this book.First, it covers ONLY limit hold 'em. This is not evident from the title of the book, and if this is intentional, it's rather shameful.Second, the content is extremely basic. The sub-title of the book: ""Making Winners out of Beginners and Advanced Players"" is completely untrue. I am an Intermediate player and I didn't find one single new idea, concept or thought in this book. Everything in here is of the most elemental nature.Having said all that, if you've never played Hold 'Em before and are looking for a nice picture book to help you get started, then this is it. Keep in mind, though, that the negative side to the illustrated format is that there is little organization to the book and even slight variances to each of the 150 situations discussed are not shown."
3,My Dad Probably Loved this Movie,"He loved all the westerns! But this one has Holden & Widmark! Not only are their scenes together a blast but Holden's scenes with Richard Rust as Sgt. Thatcher made me smile - especially when Rust was Holden's ""watchdog!"" Not a bad storyline, probably because it really happened, a true story, and there are no dull moments. This is one of those films that you'll just have to take out of the box again some rainy Saturday when you want to remember how fun the 60s were, and our favorite actors of the 40s-50s were making their last cool movies."
3,Okay Western,"This is the sort of title that, if you see it, you'll have been entertained for about 2 hours. If you don't see it, you've missed nothing.Widmark is always good, and the usually taciturn Holden (an actor of limited range) shines in his part. I guess I'm agreeing with many other reviewers in that it's the two leads' characters that make it worth watching."
4,Alvarez Kelly,"Alvarez Kelly is about cattle that both the North and South want during the civil war. The owner of the cattle is William Holden. Richard Widmark is the one that leads a group of soldiers from the South that kidnaps the cattle and also William Holden to move the cattle toward Richmond. The movie has some exciting moments in it, but also there are periods that are a little too long. Overall the movie is worth watching. For anyone who likes Richard Widmark or William Holden you will not be disappointed. It is an excellent film to add to your movie collection.GLS"
5,Absolutely Wonderful,"Thank you Shanti for providing us with a great album. Based on what I've heard I think this album has real potential. It's The kind of album you put in you system, hit repeat, and let the same one play over and over all day long."
5,spectacular,"i really enjoy everything about the album...the lyrics,the sound and the beauty of shantis voice. this is definately a spectacular debute album. usually i only like 2 maybe 3 songs on an album but this one is awesome from the beginning to the end.rock on shanti"
2,Needs work,"In my opinion, this young lady and her production company have a ways to go to rate the 5 star reviews here. All the songs except the last one are very similar -- listen to samples before you buy. If you are looking for fast percussion and excellent vocals in creatively produced contemporary pop, listen toBoys Like Girls-- that's the 5-star level."
2,Material is not soft and lower quality,"I purchased several of these shirts from Tractor Supply Co. last year and they were very comfortable and fit great. These shirts were not as well made- you could feel the difference and the weight of the material was not as heavy or soft. The fit was not very comfortable either. These were much tighter in the chest and sleeves. Something definitely changed at Carhartt. The labels show them being made in Honduras, Belize and Mexico. Cheap labor, cheap materials. Not happy."
3,wrong size,"was the wrong size,but it was a nice shirt for the price.i am ordering another shirt for the same price"
5,More Carhartt quality,"I wear these to work a lot, they are tough and comfortable. I don't know what else to say about them, they are just shirts after all."
3,Could be better.,"I have about ten of these shirts and am not happy with a number of them. The large is way too large and the medium fits but is tight. They must have had a gorilla do the initial measuring. There are two types of shirts, the thin and the heavy. The thin looks like a gorilla stomped on it when it comes out of the washing machine, the neck hole is too large and the undershirt sticks out when you wear it. The heavier shirt looks better. Aside from that the manufacturers insignia is on the pocket and it makes the shirt look like a work shirt because it is so obvious and a different color. No class. So they need to correct the sizing and change the insignia. I will try another company to get a better fit."
5,Nice,Got it for husband for Xmas he likes it a lot. He likes the carhartt brand. The color looks great and the price was perfect
5,Carhartt L/S T-shirt,I enjoy the Carhartt shirt because it has a pocket for my pen. So many shirts (like polos or other t-shirts do not have pockets). It is very comfortable and a high quality. I recommend it.
4,CARHARTT,WHAT CAN I SAY GOOD SHIRTS LIGHT COMFORTABLE GOOD FIT I AM A BIG GUY AND THE 4X IS A 4X YOU BIG GUYS KNOW WHAT I MEAN KIND OF EXPENSIVE TO ME BUT EVERYTHING IS THESE DAYS.
3,good,Great brand and like it a solid and strong and warmBeautiful colorsReached by the deadline there was no delay in shipmentAnd I'm going to deal with you in the future as well as recommend everyone to buy it according to the specifications and great qualityThank you
2,Size runs really large!,"OK shirt, but it runs really large! I typically wear a medium (38 chest/32 waist), but this shirt in MED is actually a Large, and didn't look like even after a washing would it shrink enough to become an actual MED!"
2,Horrible Sizing!,"I bought an XL, but when I got it in the mail, The shirt was HUGE!!! The shirt was either labeled incorrectly or just huge. The shirt was more like a 3X, not XL! Very dissappointed. It was supposed to be a Christmas Present so I didnt have enough time to return it."
4,Review of Carhartt Shirt,The shirt was the perfect gift for my father-in-law. He loved it. He is an old farmer who freezes all the time. The shirt was a great gift. The product was in great condition and was the color and style I ordered.
1,Not a good choice!!,"When i ordered this shirt, i ordered a size down since alot of stuff online runs bigger. (I ordered a small). When i got the shirt it was SO big! it looked like an XL. I would hate to have seen a medium! I normally wear medium size shirts but apparently carhartt doesnt make that size!!"
4,Great shirt but 3xl means 4xl,Great made shirt but if you want a 3xl you need to order a 2xl. They seam to be cut very large .
5,Word World is the greatest,"This is so-o-o-o cute. Word World is such a brilliant idea for exposing infants and toddlers to letters, speech, and vocabulary. All the stories are heart-warming and good lessons in life."
5,Good stuff,"From the first notes, Dave's stuff had me hooked. It's good, really good, much better, in my opinion, than a lot of the stuff on the music charts. Even more impressive, it sounds fresh and new and wholly original. Sure, I hear hints of Dylan, Petty and Harrison, but only as inspirations, not as sources. If you like great songs played and sung with real musicianship and taste, check out this album. You will not be disappointed."
4,Infectious Melodies,"For me, this album so strongly calls up the best of the Beatles ( the evolved Beatles, of Abbey Road, the White Album etc.) - in a couple of ways. First, with melodies that are tuneful, hummable, irresistible, that stay with you after even a single listening, and really burrow into your brain the more you hear them. And second, with sophisticated lyrics that deal with a range of topics - travel, memory, history, Empire - honestly, soulfully, and as well as they deal with love. You really get a sense of Dave Tutin as a man in the world, who has the gift of capturing and expressing that world. And don't get my Beatles analogy wrong. Tutin has a sound entirely his own--distinctive, relaxed, in command of his material. Very impressive."
4,Anime lover,"I really like some anime, and especially anything from Studio Ghibli and Hayao Miyazaki and look forward to his movies :)"
4,Mixed feelings,"This film is one i purchased without a care at the local market shop. I have mixed feelings wether i like it or not, i mean i loved the film and the cast but for a dianey film i honestly thought it was kinda sad yet a triumph of ghbili. Still its not my fave but up there"
3,Beautiful Movie - weird ending,"THe movie was very beautiful, as to be expected. The plot snippet that played through the movie was disjointed and unsatisfying at the end. Worth a watch at least once though."
5,Great movie & gift,Bought this movie for my niece and it arrived just in time for her birthday. She was so excited because she saw it in the theatre and wanted to watch it again (and again and again). She is already a huge fan of Kiki's delivery service so this was a great gift.
3,GOOD MOVIE BUT,DONT BE SURPRIZED TO FIND OUT THE THIS IS NOT AS AWESOME AS MOST ALL OTHER STUDIO GHIBLI FILMS . IT ENDS RIGHT WHEN YOU THINK THE STORY IS ABOUT TO ADVANCE AND I WAS SAYING WHAT IN THE WORLD JUST HAPPENED WHEN IT DID JUST END VERY ABRUPTLY
4,Not the best Miyazaki,"Arrietty is no ""Princess Mononoke"" or ""Spirited Away""; the background artwork is still terrific but the story line and characters are not quite Miyazaki level."
3,KIds thought it was an okay movie,Simple and captivating story for kids under 12. I doubt teenagers would be engaged in this movie as much as younger children. My husband found it boring and not interested in watching heart warming childrens story only.
3,Not the best,"Normally I'm a huge geek when it comes to Studio Ghibli films, But with this one I found it way to predictable and Kinda boring. While the film was cute and I loved Arrietty's character the film it's self was just boring. But I would highly recommend this to watch with friends or family, I had really just hoped it would have ended better rather than where it did though."
2,Mediocre...,"Studio Ghibli should realize people love their product because of their uniqueness (from a style and cultural standpoint). Their past movies have identity, poetry...the distribution agreement and increased collaboration with Disney (especially on the last 2 works) negatively impacted the purity of the story, and the original style. They could have used original Japanese songs, instead of using low-level english pop songs to increase the commercialization of the product. What a shame...back to the roots is my advice. Don't try to emulate Disney products to increase the number of potential customers...you risk to lose the ones who have been following you from the beginning. The Secret World of Arrietty is a mediocre work...it's not even comparable to previous works like Ponyo, Spirited Away, etc."
5,: ) Ghibli! Childhood! Wonder!,"was already a huge Studio Ghibli fan when they released this in the states - and this certainly lives up to their reputation both for the quality of the art work, and for the sensitivity of the storytelling."
5,Love this movie,this movie is amazing. keeps up to the standards of all his movies. Have told all my friends about this movie.
5,Superb!,"This blu disc is flawless. The visuals of the film are beautiful, and the story is a classic. Don't let your collection be missing this one, just great!"
1,The Secret World of Arreity has no Plot!,"I went to see this movie with a few friends and parents, and it was so boring. The people walked and talked at a snails place, and all the characters besides the sick boy were one dimensional. All the mom does is cook and worry, and we don't even know what the dad does. And any time something a little bit scary happened, it was over in two seconds. Also, there was really never plot for the first half of the movie except the occasional ""don't go out, you could be seen"". I'm new to animi, but my friends all love it, so I agreed to go. I was disappointed, the graphics were pretty good, but the mouthing did not match the speech. I would much rather watch a disney movie, like The Little Mermaid, Mulan, Aladdin or Beauty and the Beast, they have a moral, great characters, who are strong but not dumb, and a great plot. If you are under the age of 7 or love animi, maybe this movie is for you. I know both of my little sisters would hate it, though."
4,"Blu-ray Review: ""The Secret World of Arrietty""","Disney and Studio Ghibli banded together again to bring ""The Secret World of Arrietty"" to U.S. audiences a few months back. This animated masterpiece was critically acclaimed and captured the hearts of audiences internationally when it came out in theaters. Those who didn't see it get another chance now that it's released on Blu-ray and DVD.Fans of Studio Ghibli's movies will want to grab up ""The Secret World of Arrietty"" Two-Disc Blu-ray / DVD Combo Pack immediately. Although it might be a little light in special features, its superb high definition quality can't be beat. It's a wonderful addition to the Japanese animation studio's legacy of films."
5,Pure Ghibli through and through.,"I was worried I would not like this movie with Miyazaki not being as heavily involved as he usually is, but I was glad to find it it's just as good as most other Ghibli movies. Not the best, but very good. I've told so many people about Ghibli movies only to have them pass them off as ""Japanamation"". They're so in a league of their own I wouldn't even consider them Japanimation, One thing I like about Ghibli movies is there are no such thing as characters that are totally bad are good. They all show there's both sides to all of us. The imagination in this movie and the way it shows things in our world from a tiny person's perspective is amazing. Whether you are 3 or 65, you'll find something to love with this movie."
5,The Borrowers,The Secret World of Arriety has quickly become a favorite in our home. We love all of Studio Ghibli's films.
2,A bit of a let down,"My husband & kids were excited to see this movie...unfortunately they were disappointed. My kids ages range from 8 to 18. They didn't like much of this movie, & especially did NOT care for the ending. I wish we'd just rented it, instead of purchasing it. We usually enjoy this type of film."
5,sugoi! / great!,We love this movie. I'm so glad that the Japanese voice track with English subtitles is available in addition to the Disney release in English. This is the first movie my son sat all the way through and the first movie he could ask for by name.
5,The worlds of Miyazaki,"Although he did not direct this film, he co-wrote it. This production company (Studio Ghibli) has produced some of the finest works in animation the world has ever known. The detail and care with design is remarkable."
4,Good Family movie,Bought this for my 2 year old and 5 year old. They loved it and followed the story line quite closely. We will watch it many times I'm sure.
3,More Popular Abroad than in Japan,"Not a surprise, Arrietty, a revision of the Borrowers is already getting much higher praise than in Japan, where the main reaction of Japanese people is ""Mmn... it was blah."" I watched it myself on Friday Road Show and I didn't really like it, but then it hit me, when I watched U.S. cartoon and G.B. live versions of the Borrowers in the past, I was always bored to tears. I always thought the concept of the Borrowers was interesting but every time I saw the story in action I was disappointed. Perhaps this story is just really hard to pull off? Regardless, I advise everyone to look forward to Kokurikozaka, which I found to be much better, although like Arrietty, had pacing which I found disagreeable."
2,a complete cop out on Studio Ghibli's part,"I love Studio Ghibli and own almost all their films, upgrading them to BD as they are released. I am saying this to establish that I'm not a hater, a huge fan if anything.I love the notion of new Ghibli movies but this is absurd. As I'm sure you already know, this story is a redone (and overdone) well known tale called The Borrowers. Normally remakes and reimaginations are something I am always up for but this a boring story with several already well done animations out there. It was great when I first read and later watched this story, at this point I think its tired.This was a complete waste of talent and lacks the unique and intriguing script of Studio Ghibli's previous masterpieces. Artwork and voice acting is great as usual, you're watching and hearing great talent parade around in plagiarism.If you are oblivious to the plot already, check it out, its quite unoriginal and hokey but you won't know!Go watch Nausica or Lupita again instead."
1,Disney (dub) ruined an excellent movie,"I wish I did NOT watch Disney's dub of Arrietty earlier today.1) it was a completely stupid idea to dub the songs,2) the final narrative by the main character was introduced in Disney version only,3) I ordered a U.K. dub earlier today because it is NOT made by Disney.I understand that some stupidity had to be introduced to make it (potentially) make more money,however, this is an example of unacceptable level of dumbing-down. ""Thank you"" Disney.The movie: 5 stars, Disney dub: 0 stars."
5,A funky album!,"Yes,this is a funky album featuring two Top 10 hits,BRICK HOUSE and EASY. It was 1977 and disco was very much dominating the music world even with some white artists like The Bee Gees and K.C. & The Sunshine Band. Lionel Richie,the Commodores' staple member brings fans the nice,subtle piece EASY(for those who can't stand funk will like that track). BH really rocks,funkily. BH is a popular favorite amongst many infamous cover bands,whether their forte(s) is/are pop,rock or soul(those categories inarguably describe the style of Daryl Hall and John Oates). The Commodores put out four more albums following this one and Richie would then leave for a successful solo career(his first three solo releases were best-selling megahits). The Commodores carried on for a few years without Richie,possibly with a replacement for him. Fans of the Commodores are also fans of The Gap Band,Kool & The Gang,Ray Parker Jr. & Raydio and Chic."
3,Order and WAIT...,"I ordered this product at the end of February, but still have not received it. Don't be fooled by Amazon's statement that it will be ""in stock soon."" It does look like a nice ring, and there is a favorable review on the same ring with bigger carat weight, but it is hard to say when you will really ever get it. If you need this item in the near future, I suggest looking at another ring, or with another merchant. If you have all the time in the world, then Amazon will be able to get it to you SOMEDAY."
3,Not Enough Buttons,I owned a Harmony 659 previous to this one.I acted too fast and bought this without researching. After a bit of use I realized this remote does not have enough hard buttons to be as easy to use.I got rid of this remote and got a Harmony 676 instead. Muuuch better!
1,Remote DOA,"This remote was dead out of the box--Logitech apparently has no quality assurance for their product. That's bad enough, but their customer support is a nightmare. I speak American English. So does having to deal with an offshore operator who I could not understand make any sense? Outsourcing their support to India saves them money, but if they do that, they should insure that their operators can speak in a way that native American speakers can understand, or not outsource it at all. Add to my frustration the 40+ minute wait I had each of the 3 times called. Then to be told that there was ""no XBox Harmony Remote"", not once, but multiple times. . .well, that's simply not the way to support a higher $$ product and to win customer loyalty. I'm now told it will be a month before I can expect a replacement. The wait begins. . ."
1,Disappointment...,"Bought this maybe 3 to 4 months ago and let me just preface with the fact that all of our equipment is new. (8 month old TV, 1 year old XBOX, new receiver) At first it was perfect, then it started acting up. Namely, if you turned off everything while it was on one input (lets say Imput 3 for watching tv) and then tried to turn everything back on for the same activity, it would try to change the tv channel instead of the input. Then this morning I pick up the remote and the screen is completely cracked down the middle. Never was it thrown, tossed, sat on, or any other kind of extreme physical violence most remotes endure. The buttons still work as long as I remember what the screen usually displayed, but extremely disappointing for the price. Our other Logitech remote that is in the family room works much better, but that one isn't designed specifically for the XBOX."
1,be careful,This did not work for an LG LCD television. The delay was too long even after adjustements. It did not work well on the Bose system either.
2,Works great for a while,"I really liked this remote when I first got it, but various buttons have slowly become unusable over about a year and a half of use. The right-hand selection on the center wheel was the first to go. Then the buttons on the right side of the display screen started to act up. The remote is still usable if you ignore the center wheel and press some buttons really hard. It just seems that you're not getting real quality for the money."
5,Incredible Device!!,"I agree with the other 5 star reviewers... This thing is one of the most well thought out devices I have come across in a long time. I was worried that I would lose control of the devices because of their activity based approach but you can have your cake and eat it, too. It really delivers on all its promises. I still can't believe it. The software interface is incredible. The ONLY thing I would change about it is I wish it had a guide button in addition to the menu button to asign things too, well and maybe a FAV button, too as the buttons along the bottom don't play in too much. But really this thing is GREAT! My wife, too, is happy about its arrival. Worth every penny. Feels great in the hand. Works great with Media Center extender which is the reason I bought it. Enjoy!!!!!!!!!"
3,"A great remote, even a few years later","I've had this remote for a couple of years now and I'm still in love with it. It makes managing all of my home theater components so easy. But not everything is all sunshine and rainbows.Like I said I have had this remote for awhile, and time has not been particularly friendly to my beloved remote. Many of the buttons need to be pressed a few times for them to register now. This is annoying most especially when watching recorded shows from my DVR, the FFW button is almost useless. I have resorted to bringing back the old cable remote to control my tv shows again. I know this is because I have used the remote so much, and after a few years wear and tear is to be expected.Fair warning: treasure your early times with this remote, it works like a charm, but one day you too could resort to using multiple remotes again. It's a horrible thought, but all the same it is a reality I'm facing now."
5,Great To Simplify Complicated AV setups,"This remote is simply amazing. It is very easy to setup the way you want it to. I've had two sets of audio receivers/TV's set up with it and they all work flawlessly. I did have to jump a bit of a hoop when setting up my Samsung plasma (some problems with inputs always going to the wrong one) but it was easily fixed through some internet searches, and helped by the fact my TV should always stay in the same input, because the receiver is doing all the input switching. Works flawlessly with the 360. Batteries are surprisingly long lasting. One feature I did not find out about until I got the remote is that it has some sort of motion sensor: if you powered down everything through it, and, say, you leave it on your coffee table. If you are approacing the table and you set something on it next to the remote it lights up by itself! Great for when coming back home late and you wanna find where the remote is."
5,If the wife can use it. . . .,"This remote works great. The display and feel of the buttons are much better than previous harmony remotes that I use. Setup, as always was easy and straight forward. The wife loves it and uses it with no complaints."
3,Logitech Super Remote Rules - 99%,"For some reason the Amazon page is only allowing me to rate this 3 stars....it should be 5!!! Something wrong with the site.This thing is awesome and has just about vanquished years of anger and frustration. I have an XBOX 360, Hitachi 50"" plasma, Onkyo AV Receiver, Samsung DVD, and a Wii configured in a somewhat unorthodox way - BTW this will NOT control a Wii as it is Bluetooth.The only glitch is that I have to use my HDMI-Front input (too many HDMI devices) and there is no native Input7 - It only goes to 6, but the HDMI front is actually mapped to Input7....so the workaround was to use the input advance function when you make the remote emulate the old remote (you'll understand when you get one).If you hate lots of remotes, have some tech ability, have an XBOX you use to stream Netflix or audio from a remote computer....this is the one to buy. Well worth the money..."
2,Good remote...until the LCD screen stops working,"It's a good remote while it works. The setup was easy for me with the included software, but I'm likely more technical than most (since my day job is as a web developer). The two big problems with the remote are that a) it sucks batteries like crazy and b) the LCD screen is of poor quality. If you're a day past the 12 month warranty period, Logitech support will tell you you're SOL. What happens is that over time the LCD screen will begin to not display every other line, making it difficult to read. Mine crapped out at about the 18 month mark. If I wasn't treated poorly by Logitech's customer service department, I would just buy another one, but with the blowoff they gave me I think I'll be buying another device."
4,Happy but it's a bit awkward,"It's great to have something that consolidates all the remotes into one, but there is a lot lost in terms of the clicks. I still find myself wishing for the old remotes at times. Otherwise, it works well (most of the time)."
5,Awesome Universal Remote,"This remote is amazing and exactly what I wanted. It works especially great if you have the hd dvd player for the Xbox 360. The remote is easy to use and we no longer have 5 remotes laying around. We have it hooked up to the xbox, hd dvd, dvd, stereo, tv and cable."
4,A Plumbers Review,"I will start by saying that although programing this remote is easier than writing macros it can be a little daunting for those that have a harder time with computers or electronics. It does not work right out of the box. It took me about two hours to get this remote the way I want, and I'm still changing things around, but that is the beauty of this thing because it is so customizable. Once it is set up it is quite easy to use. It can be a little slow so make sure you keep it pointed at your entertainment system until every thing sets up. This probably would not be my first choice in remotes but I wanted something I could use to watch dvds and control netflix without using my xbox controller. Unfortunately; as with a lot of products, there are a lot of bad reviews due to peoples electronic ignorance or inability to follow the instructions as this product does take a bit of trial and error and patience to program."
3,Good Remote For Xbox Users,"About the only important feature this remote adds over the other Harmony remotes is the Yellow, Blue, Green and Red. I really liked this remote until I got a different harmony, the 880, bearing in mind the 880 is significantly more expensive, given the choice, even for xbox I would probably go with the 880. The xbox Harmony remote feels pretty decent to the hand, it programs the same as all of the other harmony remotes. My only complaints are the ""clicking"" of the buttons when you press them, the occasional stuck button that goes crazy and drives the volume up and the custom buttons/""green"" screen aren't as easy to read as some of the other harmony remotes.HOWEVER, I wouldn't steer anyone away from this remote, it's not a bad remote, it's just not as good as some of the other Harmony options."
3,"Great functionality, annoying buttons","The Functions of the remote all work great, everything you want to do requires one button press. They only bad thing is the button. They are really small and hard to press without looking. The channel and volume buttons also click when you press them, which is pretty annoying as well."
2,For the Price...I would think about it,"I have had the remote for a little over 2 years and it does solve the problem of multiple remotes, BUT the batteries die quickly ( so I had to purchase rechargeable batteries for it), and now some of the buttons are non responsive and its always dying quickly. I paid $100 or so for this and I can not say I want to buy another Harmony as they are so many refurbished models for sale, so obviously something about all Harmony remotes make them non durable."
4,"Solid, but wish it had R/F.","Especially for the price, this is a great little remote. The lack of RF capabilities makes it a little bit of a bummer when you want to stick your xbox in a (well ventilated!) cabinet, but a little creativity with an X10 I/R retransmitter and you're pretty much good to go.For those that don't know, these harmony remotes are KILLER for making a multi-device entertainment solution easy for the whole family to enjoy. Even my 5 year old can start up the Xbox, TV and AMP with one click and absolutely no problems."
3,Harmony makes great remotes- This one is ok,"All I can say i that I love Logitech remotes they really do everything, easy to set up programing is simple and I love having multiple activities set up. However I bought this remote a couple of years ago and it was only $50 back then how anyone in their right mind would spend $150+ is crazy. My only other complaint is that they dont last that long. buttons will tend to stick, the writing on the buttons wears off. If you can find at a good price by all means get one. otherwise get a better model"
1,Garbage Screen,"The LCD screen on this remote is utter garbage. 2 weeks after initial purchase it turned into straight lines and now it is completely empty. Logitech keeps giving me the run around with firmware updates, reference numbers, safe mode, etc etc. Buyer Beware."
1,This thing sucks,It turns off your xbox when you just want to watch tv. There is no video select switch and you to press seven buttons to get anything to work. The software wont fix any problems with it and you have to point it at whtever it is you want to work even with brand new batteries. You can get most of thee features with a ten dollar universal remote. Dont waste your money on this crap. Trust me. Complete waste of money!!!
1,Broke,This crap broke in like 4 months.Before that it was ok. It was annoying having to switch from TV to DVR.
1,broke after 14 months,"Great flexibility. It can control almost all my home theater system. But bad quality and not durable... after 14 months of normal use, LCD is not displaying properly and the buttons are not responsive as it used to be. (heck.. I even treat this remote as good as my digital SLR)My cheap 20 dollar universal remote outlasted this expensive piece of junk. Would not recommend this product and simply waste of money."
3,A real pain at first...,"When I first got this controller I was disappointed. Setting it up was a pain and it took me a couple hours to get it working how I wanted. Once you finish the setup process though, it's great. I love this controller and can't imagine going back to before. I highly recommend it, but you need to be at least a little electronics savy to get through the setup phase. Otherwise, I think you'll just give up and return it.Pros:+ All-in-one controller, works with pretty much anything.+ Macros functions are very cool and handy.+ Xbox 360 focus on some functionality is great. (if you have a 360)Cons:- Hard to setup initially.- Buttons are a bit small and the layout could be better- Macros don't always work right."
4,Buy Harmony 550 instead,I came close to buying the 360 model but I found out a few things. You might notice that the Xbox 360 harmony control looks a lot like the Harmony 550. Well it's because it's almost exactly the same thing. Here's the difference. The 550 has more buttons. The AXBY buttons on the Xbox model are dedicated to Xbox 360. 550 model has extra programmable buttons. The 550 is also in a different color. Also the 550 can control your 360 but allows you to control more devices. I seriously recommend this remote for replacing all your other remotes and you can read my full review of the harmony brand controllers under the 550.
2,Lacks button durability,"Logitech makes superior products and the ones that I own have performed well over time, except for this remote. After four years of use, buttons that control DVD playback have failed. It is a physical problem . . . the contacts under the buttons started to lose connection and slowly deteriorated to make the unit useless.This is an expensive remote, and there is no excuse for a product of this type and design, used exclusively in an adult-only household, to fail from its physical design and construction. As with most consumer items, repair will likely cost as much as I paid for the remote, new. The alternative is to discard it into the global Himalayas of electronic device garbage. Totally unacceptable."
4,Best Remote I've Owned,"Took a while to get used to, and there are a few imprefections I would've loved to see fixed, but overall, this is a good remote. It's easy to program, easy to use. My wife gets it, and she enjoys her luddite status when it comes to the home theater.Some of the cons: software is a bit slow/clunky. Can't use the power buttons on the devices directly (must use this remote to turn things on and off).The pros outweigh the cons, though. The buttons are easy to use without looking, and the overall experience is great. The remote's activity paradigm, where you create activities like ""Watch TV"", ""Watch DVD"", ""Watch DVD (no receiver)"", etc. is great. It makes it easy to make custom settings for each activity, including changing picture modes, which device controls the volume, etc.I love it. I've had it for over a year now and still enjoy using it. I think that says a lot right there."
3,Worked great... While it worked.,"I enjoyed this remote until the rewind and play buttons stopped working, which made it useless to me as I have DVR and frequently watch DVD's. I am not sure if this happened because of frequent use or maybe it was dropped a few times, so I am not holding this agaisnt Logitech. I only owned the remote for less than a year and I would've hoped it would've been more durable.Aside from that the remote worked great with all of my devices. It is easy to program, the macros are great and te buttons were responsive until whatever happened happened. I would reccomend this to anyone and just hope you get a more durable one. I like this enough to purchase a Logitech remote in the future, I just might get some extended warranty if I can."
5,Awesome!!,"Product works exactly as advertised. Install software, plug into PC and go. Setup took no time at all and I was running my entire entertainment system at the push of a button. Only possible negative would be the battery life. 4 AAA batteries don't seem to last long. I figured out that if you don't use the light-up feature as much, they seem to last longer."
5,Logitech Harmony Xbox 360 Remote,"great product works with everything we have av receiver, xbox, projector, and TV. controls not only everything but without having to change the modes, from TV to the receiver, very easy to set up using usb and computer. great price compared to others."
3,"Great concept, lacking implementation","This thing works as advertised. You get connect to the internet and use the software to define the devices, and the define what activities you do with those devices and how the remote control should behave during each activity. You have to teach the remote sometimes as devices don't behave exactly as they should, which isn't too bad.The real bad thing is that the buttons are too ""clicky"" and tough to push. Add to that the delay between clicking and actually carrying out the command even on the fastest settings. This may not sound as too big a problem, but when you are trying to go into menus and adjust settings it becomes frustrating.Over all, 3 out 5."
4,Rave on from start to finish,"This is a fun hard rocking release by Ian Hunter and Mick Ronson,it is Ian Hunter at close to his best.I saw them live when they toured to support this CD and they absolutely kicked.It was one of the best concerts that I've been to.I can listen to this CD for hours.That being said if they had left off the two Mick Ronson solo cuts if would have been a 4 1/2 star Cd as Mick Ronson was a great guitarist but most high school garage bands can write songs this good."
5,A great devotional on Margin,A great devotional on Margin - my 18 year old grand daugther loves this book. It has made a big impact on her life.
2,I was a little bit disappointed!,"I was very expecting and excited after reading reviews. Besides this book was applaused by many establishments: I think that I was too naive! As a matter of fact, this book did not meet my expectation. I was looking forward to the style of Agatha Christie's mysteries, but it was not. The ending was pretty clear from the middle of story. But, overall, it was fine book."
4,"Exquisite, engrossing tale.","The day before young Jeremy Proctor is to report to his new apprenticeship with printer, Mr. Crabb, a horrible murder occurs. Crabb, his wife and children, and two of his assistants are butchered in their beds. The suspect is a mad poet, John Clayton, who was found holding an axe and covered with blood in the house. While Sir John Fielding investigates the crime, he and Jeremy become aware of a new direction for their lives and their interest is aroused by a religious sect from America.Jeremy is now 13 and thrilled to be taken into Sir John's household as are the readers. You are transported to Regency London to observe actual historical characters as they might have been. Vivid language, multi-dimensional characters, and carefully detailed descriptions all contribute to a rich tale of murder most foul."
2,A Disappointing Sequel,"The sequel to Alexander's excellent ""Blind Justice"" is a disappointment. There is no solution and no surprise; the culprit is obvious early on, and the story ends with an all-too-familiar chase scene instead of a triumph in detection. The setting will once again please some readers, but the plot leaves much to be desired. For devoted fans only."
5,Excellent fun!,"This series is a wonderful find for any reader. As one not usually interested in mystery, I can't put Bruce Alexander's books down. The imagery of London in the 1700s is brilliant, as are the characters. I certainly hope Mr. Alexander continues to write these wonderful and absorbing stories. And who is Bruce Alexander, anyway?"
3,An ok read,"Fun historical fiction, but pretty predictable. Definately not as good as the 1st or 3rd books. I would read it anyway to keep up with the likeable characters."
2,underdeveloped and predictable,"Murder in Grub Street is a lot like Columbo: you know who the killer is from the beginning (with the book, the middle of the story); the rest is sitting back and watching how the detective(s) figure the murderer out. Unfortunately, I'm not a fan of Columbo or this book. There is no suspense. There is barely even a hesitation as to when Sir Fielding believes that the Brethen of Spirit is the killers. The author, from the introduction of these characters, almost singled them out as the bad guys; sure, he paid attention to what the other suspects were doing, but he made sure that the detectives (a.k.a. Fielding and Jeremy) knew about all the mean things the Brethen did. Like I said, all the talk about the Brethen left no spaces for any ""surprises""; no twists, no sudden revelations revealed. Murder in Grub Street was mediocre at best, nothing short of boring."
4,Sir John Fielding mysteries,I love Bruce Alexander's Sir John Fielding mysteries. Sir John can teach those of us in the 21st century something. I take great delight in the growing bond between Sir John and Jeremy.
5,Great Buy!,"I bought the Combi Counerpart 2 and I am very happy with it. I had been looking at double strollers for a few months. I have a 16 month old son that is 3 feet tall, and he fits in it very well, with a lot of room to grow. I'm having another baby in October this stroller is the one to get the carrying capacity is 80lbs 40 per seat. It's very easy to steer, and the design is unisex. Mom's trust me if you need a double stroller get this one."
2,Received product bent,"The product was packaged poorly and arrived bent. I was able to use pliers to bend it back into shape because I didn't want the hassle of the return. Plus, I saw the same product at the Halloween store for $2 less."
3,"Not bad, in a deliverance sort of way, beware the EP tape sp","First, you should know that this tape is recorded at EP (or SLP) speed, and so quality is not great. I wish I'd known that before buying it. But the movie itself is not bad. If you liked the treatment of the victims in Deliverance, you probably will like this movie. The message got a little lost on me as there are violent parts that I can't really reconcile with the poor treatment of the land by the logging company. Social injustice meets violence, it's a theme that belongs in escapist action movies, where you know all too well that there's no reason to suspect that this might be a way to deal with a real problem. In this movie, this isn't so clear. On the other hand, who wouldn't want to do what Arthur did to the loud partying folk in the next room? All in all ok, but not the best movie you'll ever see."
5,Still Awsome,"This is an old school NDN movie that was hard hitting and shockingly honest for that time, and it still rocks today.G. Green turns in an awsome performace and continues to shine to this day."
1,Radical story - In its day...,"I got this video because my brother said it was such a great movie...He was wrong...It may have been radical and extreme in its day..However, with todays sick serial killers, and celebrity cannibals, its pretty tame stuff to watch now..MJL"
1,Confusingly violent & awful,"I didn't know what this movie was about when I saw it. This was one of the most confusing and awful movies I have ever seen. I could not finish it. (I don't like horror movies.)Yes, the trees are beings and they bleed too. I detest the current logging practices and the disenfranchisment of first nation peoples! But the uncontrolled rage in this movie chased me to the off button! All most people saw was some cold-blooded beserk guy mutilating another guy without really understanding why. I guess it was one of those 'arthouse films' with a message. Well... it's not a message I want to hear. I've seen too much violence in the world to want to invite that into my house."
1,READ THE REVIEWS CAREFULLY-A LOT OF VIOLENCE,"Low quality, too violent, not worth the $10 - I would return it if I could. The idea is good: we should not ravage the environment, we should respect nature and each other. Unfortunately, the message is delivered through ""an eye for an eye"" method: the wronged native american severely and violently tortures the callous white american to demonstrate how nature is tortured. The net result: I could have skipped (and did, after the violence started) viewing the movie, and would have been better off."
2,Entertaining but harmful,"I enjoyed the movie, but I found the depiction of Greene's character disturbing. He was reduced to a violent savage, and the white lawyer ends up the hero in the end. Does this stereotype really need a reprise?Be warned: Gruesome scenes."
1,Graham Greene's worst movie,"I bought Clearcut because it features Graham Greene, who has done so well in other movies such as Dances With Wolves and Thunderheart. Unfortunately, Greene didn't perform well and the script was awful. The violence depicted in the movie had no point, and the environmental isses that supposedly led to the violence were not resolved. The basic message is: Don't bother watching this movie."
5,Clearcut,"As an Alaska Native, I have heard all my life about the horrible atrocities that had been committed against American tribes and a pristine land when the ""Manifest Destiny"" was in full swing. The anglo saxon/european settlers destroyed everything in their path in the name of progress, and their decendants are still destroying the environment today. First, it was the Native Americans/Canadians and the land, and now the forests. In this movie, Mother Earth was symbolically asking the businessman, ""How would you like it if I ravaged your body?"" while Graham Green represented the Native peoples in exacting cruel punishment on a symbolic cynical, greedy, self-serving businessman. I give Graham Green five stars for having the courage to make such an important movie."
5,To The Point,This movie was as it states clearcut. The whole basis of this movie is to make aware what is happening every day to our forests and how our fine Government steps all over the first peoples. How money is more important than our very future. If you caught the end you notice that Arthur disappears into the water which leads me to know that he was in fact a spirit of the tree peoples. I loved the movie.
1,Pop Trash,"The ""Same Ol' Same Ol'"" beat is ripped straight out of Dr.Dre's ""The Next Episode"". At least make your own msuic."
1,...,"This CD sucks, the only song I actually liked was 'Sweet Kisses', as corny as it was...this just isn't good pop music."
1,The worst CD I ever listened to,This is even worse than most of the manufactured garbage out there today. Don't listen to this (...)
2,Another Girl Group,They have have pretty good voices and the harmony sounds pretty good...but they also sound like every other young girl group out there. The subject matter is kind of old. I think if they came out with more original lyrics/content they'd be more of a success.
2,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, said, I said I've heard it before",I had real high hopes with this CD and I like a few songs on it-- only two or three. They sound like everyother girl band out there. They don't write any of there songs and they are pretty computerized. Trust me you'll put this CD in your player once and it'll sit there for a few day's until you can't take the pain anymore and you'll get something that sounds unique. Try Michelle Branch and Dido and deffenitally the Beatles. Don't waste your $$.
5,NOT THE SAME OL SAME OL,"Dang these girls are not only hot but can also sing. All the songs are good. I have been a PYT fan for the longest time and have seen there voices mature. This album really expresses years of experience. You Truly need to purchase this cd. It also features Sarai a newcommer of rap. With these ladies mixed up in one bundle, we've got chemistry. My favorite tracks are 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10, 11,12,13,14,15 and the hidden track by Sarai herself. This is truly a great debut album. Youve gotta love them. PYT will conquer the world. PLEASE SUPPORT THEM. 5 stars all the WAY>"
4,I loved this album!,"When i got this cd, i thought, o yeah, whatever, just a bunch of stuck up britney wannabes- but it turns out they are actually pretty good. they sound similar to britney spears, but they don't sound like... my fav song was deep down, it's a really cool slow song."
4,Pros and Cons...,Pros:- Loaded with features (pretty much like a cell phone).- Speaker phone on handset and Base.- Can maintain separate address books on each of the handset and base. Can transfer individual phone number or entire address book from one unit to another.- Good Looks and Ease of usage.- Light weight.Major Cons:- Handset speaker phone has very low volume (not good for a decent conversation).Minor Cons:- Speed dial is not so 'speedy'. Its a 2 step process - press and hold the number assigned for speed dial and then press the talk button. (the second step could have been eliminated)
1,Fatal Defect,"I was so excited when I found this phone because it had all the features I had been looking for. Unfortunately it also had a problem with losing the volume coming through the receiver periodically during calls. The volume would come and go throughout calls. I contacted Uniden (expect to be on hold for up to 30 minutes) and they sent me a refurbished phone - same problem. It was NOT a problem with interference or DSL. This phone is defective. I googled the phone and problem and found other people reporting the exact same frustration. I wish I could have made this phone work, but the volume issue is not something you can live with. DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE."
2,Find another Phone,"This phone had all the features we were looking for. Speaker phone, caller id, etc, and an expandable base phone. Well, the base phone works fine, but upstairs where we have the other phone, if you walk into any of the other rooms you lose the call. We have a 1800 sq ft house, so it's not that far away from the base phone. Very disappointed. I haven't dared to venture outside to see if the base phone has problems away from its' unit."
4,Extension buzz,"The phone functions fine on the main unit, but the extension transmitter has a buzz which is annoying. I do not know if this is common and have not sought to have it rectified. The handsets are fine when used near the main base. The features on the phone are handy and the display is easy to read."
2,Uniden cordless phone,"I do not recommend this phone. I purchased this set and an additional extension. All three periodically lose incoming sound volume. If you rap it on a hard surface, the volume returns to normal. I tried the factory recommended fix, and it did not work.Nice features, but a bad phone."
1,Very Bad Hand se t,I have used cordless phone for so many year and had never see such a bad hand set.. The battery doesnt fit in the compartment properly and it makes lot of noise every time u lift the hand set or shake it.. I would rather call this as a pencil box and not a phone... Please dont buy this...
1,What a disappointment!,"I read all the reviews here before buying this phone system -- and it's terrible. People tell me my voice breaks up using the speaker phone on the handsets (inevitably, I have to take the call off speaker phone; this is a big problem for me, as I work often from home and need 2 hands free to type/take notes); the volume fades terribly on all 3 of the handsets I bought, and sometimes unpredictably; and you can't dial back using callerID (it doesn't put the ""1"" before the area code -- how stupid...). Even when not using speaker phone, the voice quality is terrible -- my father-in-law can't understand a thing my husband says on the phone, he has started to plug an old corded phone in to a jack somewhere in the house to talk to his dad. I had a Panasonic for years before this system, and it had no issues. I'm ready to throw this one away and write it off. Uniden never bothered to respond to my customer support inquiry over the web. I'll never buy another product from them."
4,Cordless Phones,"Really liked the size, price, and features. Some of the features include the Dual Keypad, speaker phone, and Call Waiting/Caller ID. The Extra Handset is really nice. It has a speaker phone on both handsets as well as the base. This makes it really nice when you have family call and everyone in the house can hear them. I would recommend the phone system to everyone."
2,?Hello ?Hello,"This phone is really cool but it has two major flaws. The first is the caller ID problem which the other posts have already described in som detail. The second is that although the incoming volume is fine, the people on the other end have trouble hearing me and say that i sound 'far away and very soft'. Troubleshooting and reseting doesn't seem to help. Will return ASAP."
1,Worthless,"I recently upgraded to this phone from an older similar 2.4GHz Uniden phone to try and alleviate interference with my wireless network. This new phone is much worse. People I talk to think I'm on a bad cell phone connection and can only catch half of what I'm saying. From my end, every minute or so the volume fades out and comes back 30 seconds later. I called Uniden support and they recommended moving the base station and re-registering the handset, neither of which made any difference. I was drawn to this phone by the great features, good reviews, and past experience with Uniden phones, but I am sorely disappointed."
1,Great Phone - Base Stopped Working in 3 Months (New Base Works Fine),"This was the best cordless phone I have purchased. The functionality and features were great. Unfortunately, 3 months after purchasing the phone (2+ 1 extra handset), all phones started to say out of range and could not connect. It also failed to reset, leaving the entire system useless. Uniden customer service advised that I can mail back and have them check for repair. Not worth the effort.Purchased replacement base unit and it has been working properly since."
1,I do not recommend this phone,"We purchased this system in the summer of 2007. The system worked fine for about a year then started going bad. The primary complaint is the sometimes you will dial a call, hear the ringer sound one time and then the phone flashes ""Out of Range"" and goes dead. This has happened on three out of the four handsets, including the one on the base station when it was only 5 feet away from the base station. The fourth handset never gets used. When this happens the base station flashes a ""Welcome"" message and appears to be rebooting. The handset stays in talk mode and you have to press the end call button and start again. Evidently the one ring you hear is not going through because I have questioned the folks I was calling and they never heard a ring."
4,so close...,"I won't bother listing all of the good things about this phone (and there are many) because others have already done so. So, this just leaves my complaints:1.I can not find an easy way to add a 1 in front of the phone number when returning a call from caller ID that has a different area code, without either entering the number by hand or saving it to the address book and editing the number.2. The message waiting light only indicates messages on the machine and not on voice mail. I would have preferred a phone with no answering machine as i use voice mail, but could not find one with all of the other features that i wanted.Overall a very nice phone."
3,The range on this phone is disappointing,"The range on this phone is much less than the range for the phone I was trying to replace. I am actually quite disappointed by this phone. It cannot reach from the downstairs base to our upstairs bedroom - and let me be clear, I do not live in a Trump mansion."
1,both handsets failed within 7 months,"Great phones until 6.5 months, when handset #1's buttons all failed to work, as did handset #2's did two weeks later. Could not reset. Uniden is asking for my credit card to pay for shipping? Hmmm."
2,"Well, naturally.","I bought this item on March 6, just before the spate of reviews noting the problem with loss of volume. Mine does this too. I *have* found that if you are willing to use the speaker option, this is cured, or at least far less noticeable. Unfortunately, I don't care much for speaker, and some of the people I call, or who call me, absolutely hate it - so that's not a great solution.The phone's features are just what I needed. They just don't always include audible reception. A pity."
2,Interesting travel through Australia,One learns a lot about the history of the Songlines and what they mean to the natives. This was a book in a book group to which I belong. I would not have read it otherwise.
3,Canterbury's Law,"The DVDs are good, but if you like ""The Good Wife"" series, expect a much less polished production. Julianna Margulies does an excellent job and plays much of the same type roll. For the price it is worth the entertainment it offers and I would recommend it. Remember there are only 6 shows in this series, but still very good."
4,Canterbury's Law: The Complete Series,"I have always liked this actress, an enjoyable series and a pity it wasn't continued. Unfortunate that a ""Complete Series"" always leaves you hanging as it would be nice to have an ending, whether it's the one you'd like or not."
4,Only five eps??,"What is wrong with these networks? This was quite a solid show, from what little I saw, and it should have been given more of a chance, a better time slot, something. With Denis Leary producing along with J. Margulies and with Jace Alexander directing, it was a quality show about a troubled attorney whose marriage is crumbling not only due to her work but also due to the abduction of her young son.Give it a shot!"
4,"A Good Series, But Underdeveloped","Julianna Margulies (The Good Wife) stars in this engaging legal series. She heads a criminal defense law firm that takes on interesting cases dealing with rape, murder, and mayhem. She has a staff of several loyal underlings, all lawyers, who work with her. Margulies, in this series, carries some heavy baggage. Her young son Sam was kidnapped while under her watch several years ago and she is laden with guilt. Her marriage (to Aiden Quinn) is falling apart despite attempts at marriage counseling. Margulies plays a tough, quick-speaking and hard-nosed attorney who defends her clients to the max. In her personal time, she has a fling with her investigator and drinks too much. Unfortunately, Fox cut the series after seven episodes and so it is not as developed as it could be. It shows a lot of promise and is a good series to rent from Netflix or Blockbuster. I don't really recommend buying it as it's not a series one would watch more than once."
3,a title,Product arrived missing half of the hardware. After a trip to the auto store installation was easy and looks great. Product does not have pocket cut outs as shown in pictures.
3,Not too crazy about it,"It's good for kids but not good if you are looking for a big the steamy relaxing shower. The flow is not too strong but it has it's adv.In all, I pay for what I get!"
1,POOR DESIGN; SHOULD BE TAKEN OFF MARKET,Once you turn on the water handheld portion falls out of the shallow bracket. The cord is very stiff and keeps the sprayer from seating all the way making it impossible to shower unless you are holding the sprayer. It has already worked loose at the connector and leaking. Manufacture did not design or test product in the real world. Save your money.
1,Poorly designed by Pollenex - a must to avoid!,"Very poor design on this Pollenex hand held. Constantly falls off wall mount while in use, could cause injury such as broken bones in foot! Notice how 95% of the mass and weight of the shower head rises above the wall attachment. Very poor design, apparently designed by someone who doesn't know much about physics or gravity. Avoid this one and look for a model or brand that attaches to wall mount more securely by attaching higher up the handle, not the very bottom!"
1,Don't waste your time...,I picked up one of these and it was nothing but trouble. The sprayer won't stay in the base. It's a bit hard to soap up when you have to hold a sprayer in one hand. Unfortunately it's not a defective unit. It's just a very poor design.
3,Having fun with it.,"When I first bought mine it wouldn't even turn on. Good thing there's an extra fuse under the power cord inlet at the rear. I replaced the fuse and I'm now using it with no problems. It's not a very powerful amp, but I'm sure my neighbors won't like it any louder.However, if you set the bass control too high along with the volume, the cabinet buzzes at the lower notes."
3,"76 CSX - MARINE, PERO NO MUCHO.","I used the 76 CSX few times in my small boat in Brazil. The boat has a 90hp etech engine by BRP, a very quite engine. I was surprised by the fact that the unity has no volume control for its alarms. If your are navegating and getting close to a non visible object the alarm set for proximity will not be heard. It is very low volume.NortonGarmin GPSMap 76CSx Mapping Handheld GPS"
2,The purchase that really didn'd work out,"I knew it was used and a year old, but I had confidence it would meet my needs. Unfortunately, after about 6 months it totally stopped recognixing satelellites (which makes it as usefull as a paperweight). I was out to sea sailing when it failed, but as was just a few miles off the coast, I was able tio navigate usine shore based landmarks. If I would have been truly out at sea, it could have caused a much more serious issue. So you win some and you lose some. I probably won't purchase ttems that involves ""life-safety"" from Amazon in the future."
5,A replacement for a lost Garmin GPS 76CSX,I lost the original at a flight park. so more or less I needed another for my Ultralite. I am expecting this one to perform as well as the first. Garmin makes a high quality product and that is whats needed when your flying and need to get back home safely. The garmin GPS can be relied on to do the job.
2,Garmin GPSMAP 76CSX,"Good overall. Less accurate than my Garmin Etrex Summit HC, yet twice the price. Too big to carry comfortably. The only thing I liked over the Etrex was it's ability to float. Optional maps not important because they cost $119.00 each. I ended up with the Delorme PN40 for $289.00 which has a much better base map that incorporates a street level map, topographic maps, USGS, Quads, marine, aerial and for $29.95 a year subscription to upgrade all maps."
5,Garmin 76CSX,outstanding product - I was in the midst of a GPS Adult Ed class when I purchased this product. As this is same unit that we used in class it is very helpful. Just add maps for the area that you need and go.
3,Has not gotten better,"I bought a Garmin S76 a number of years ago, and recently bought another for my girlfriend's birthday. The new one is a lot more complicated to operate, even considering the increase in features. We use our GPSs to geocache, so being able to make changes to the display and the data presented there on the fly is important. I can do the required changes with my older model with one or two keystrokes, while hers requires 3-4 times as many (no exaggeration)."
5,Great for Geocaching.,"Wife is into Geocaching. The X chip GPS units are the only way to go for this. We started out with some cheaper ones, but since a lot of the stuff is in places there are trees the older ones were a major pain. These work no matter where you are, does not matter how heavy the tree cover, you still get a very good reading."
1,"Bad display, bad graphics, very disappointed","I don't know if any device maker can still find such a lousy LCD screen to put into their design; the LCD screen of this product reminds me a 1980 PC with really bad graphics display, and they still manage to charge people with a premium price. Nowadays, a $500 PC with more expensive components has a screen much bigger and better. This small device made by Garmin is a rip-off, just from the LCD point of view."
1,late arrival was big disappointment,"The one star rating of product due only to late arrival of product, which was a major disappointment for intended gift recipient. Had Amazon been able to provide correct information concerning when to expect delivery of this product, we would have paid more for express shipping. Product arrived approx 5 days past expected latest due date."
3,Garmin 76 CSX,"Product is OK, but all of the stuff you need to buy to make it work is limited. Bought it for the marine use on inland lakes and they offer the software, but it has no real detail like the maps you buy for the same lakes. Instructions are limited and you just have to trial and error to make it work. Also ordered the city navigation but even though it is a 2010 map, it is out of date. Also the detail of places to see and eat is out of date."
4,"great, but ...",This is a huge upgrade from my earlier generation GPS. Acquisition is very fast and the GPS works in environments in which my previous GPS would not be usable.Unfortunately I also get to provide a customer evaluation of Garmin service as my unit intermittently freezes up. Hopefully this experience will be OK as this GPS appears to be an excellent product.
1,Not Compatible with Routes Created in Mapsource,"Routes created using Garmin's mapsource software on a PC may be transferred to the GPSMAP 76, but when recalculated by the handheld, the routes are not the same as those created in mapsource. In fact, they were substantially different.Garmin support explained that the Mapsource software and the GPS76CSX use different routing algorithms. The only way around this is to add waypoints in the Mapsource routes to force the handheld to follow the routes you create on the PC. There is nothing in the documentation of either about this problem. This is a time consuming pain in the A.This is enough of a problem that we would not purchase garmin for this use again. The routes designed on the PC must match the routes in the handheld after transfer."
1,can't transfer map,"Just learned from a Garmin support representative that I am unable (not allowed) to transfer my Garmin BlueChart map onto this new Garmin unit, because I have the map already installed on two other, older Garmin units.I call this defective by design.Will never buy Garmin again!"
3,Garmin GPS 76CSX Handheld GPS with Barometric Altimeter and Electronic Compass,"I purchased this unit primarily for geocaching. I was very disappointed to find that I cannot access the hints and comments from the geocache description, just the coordinates. Has anyone else had the same experience? Also, how do I stop a track log, say, at the end of a hike or bike trip? Thanks"
4,Solid GPS,"A decent GPS with the features that are important. Auto routing, both serial and UBS. The micro SD it comes with is small (only 256M), a 2G is large enough to hold the whole USA metro guides."
3,disappointed for marine applications,"The interface feels like its 20 years old -- or developed by MS.The screen declutter options are useless resulting in a display that is covered with notes about everything you don't want to know. On a tight course, you will see nothing other than irrelevant commentary for each waypoint the program creates. I have some courses where the notes are all you can see on the screen. Let's hear it for ""6ft max depth"". That's the unalterable default. Per Garmin, the comments for these waypoints cannot be modified.Brilliant Garmin.For me, the controls at the top of the screen are poorly placed. Everytime you press a button you have to reach across the screen to get to it. Blocked vision and countless rub marks. Think cell phone with the key pad at the top. Another atta boy.We bought it for an emergency backup unit that I thought would be fun to have around. We've had it for 3 months now and it has yet to be turned on while on the boat."
3,"Good, basic help with directions","Not being familiar with other GPS equipment, I expected the technology to be a bit more advanced. I purchased this unit to help guide me on horseback through the mountainous national forest that surrounds my farm. Although the unit provides elevation information, the topography detail leaves much to be desired. I purchased the 2008 TOPO map software, but realized that I'm not going to get the detail I see on my computer to appear on the unit.I also wish it was a bit more intuitive to use. Bottom line, it gets me where I'm going."
4,Good Buy,I have had a few GPS units in this category and this is the best. This GPS unit does everything it claims very well except for the electronic compass. The unit must be held level for the compass to work properly. Typical mounting on a boat is not level. It would be better if the base map was more detailed. Visit mountguysdotcom for good mounting hardware.
4,Locks on to satellites easily,"This GPS works.I don't know much about GPS but I have used a Trex Vista infrequently for 3 years. It struggled to find satellites so the 76's ability to do so impresses me. For the price I think it should come with a detailed map of your area of interest, so I gave it 4 stars. I like the shape of the 60 series better and the screen on top. I like the ability of the 76 to float and its moisture tolerance. Expect to pay $100's for maps and you can only download Garmin maps except I have seen maps of ski areas advertized that are supposed to download to Garmin receivers. I'm convinced that expandable memory is the way to go, hence the x. I like the compass and altitude/pressure features, hence the S. I'm not convinced the color screen is a big deal."
1,Great watch... questionable bands!,"My Suunto Observer is the BEST watch I have ever owned!However, the watch bands they make for it are terrible.These 2 bands are the 5th and 6th I have had to purchase in the 5 years I have owned the watch.For some reason, they have not figured out how to make the bands so that they will not quickly begin to crack and then come apart where the buckle is on them after about a year of use.I tried buying them from the Suunto site first.They, as usual, were not in stock there.Thank goodness Amazon keeps them."
1,waste of money,"I bought my third replacement strap in four years. The plastic starts cracking after a year and on the most current one the metal pin that locks the buckle broke off after about a month, making the whole strap unusable. This is a faulty product that the manufacturer should have replaced long time ago. I advise against buying the Observer altogether because of the faulty strap."
2,Replace the Suunto band,"If this band was factory issue, which I don't think it was, the quality has gone way down. This replacement was of such poor quality that I used the buckle and snaps from the band I was replacing. The band didn't fit the watch very easy, but I don't think that was a quality issue with this band, as they are just difficultto replace.In closing, it was cheaper than others, but I think I know why now. I would not purchase this itemagain."
2,Suunto Observer ST Band,"Great watch - substandard band. Although it has been a problem for years Suunto has yet to devise an alternative or a modification to the strap that is more durable.Nearly $100 for a replacement strap, that under normal wear and tear lasts 2-years, is a little steep.Look at the reviews and respond to your customer's requests Suunto!"
3,"good price, but a pain to install","I was leary of buying these at full price from the manufacturer, so finding them here for less was nice. So far I have had no problem with the band itself afte almost a month.The only major issue is that they do not come with the Suunto tool the makes reinstalling a new band easy. It took about an hour to fight the new bands onto the watch body, the tool would have made it much faster. It comes with purchase of a band from Suunto, but for saving what I did on this band I'm not complaining too much."
3,Suunto Wrist StainSteel,This band really dresses up the rubber band. I have had no problems with the stainless steel band however it is difficult for Jewelers to switch the bands. It is a pretty expensive product so it depends if you have the disposable income to purchase the strap.
3,"Great Watches, lousy bands","Suunto makes great watches but if I had known how many bands I would have to replace over the years I would not have bought into the brand in the first place. I actually have three different Sunnto watches and they all have had band problems. The Observer, most expensive, is the worst but in general the experience is frustrating. This is the fourth band I've had to order in the last 8 years for the Observer. The others have only been replaced once each but they are sailing watches and not worn even close to everyday. For what they cost they should stand up better. They always fail in the same manner, the crap rubber like material breaks and that's it. I even had a leather band special ordered from Finland and that only lasted 1 year. Until I finally break down an buy a different everyday travel watch I'll only buy the cheapest bands they have and expect to replace them. Most frustrating..."
4,elastomer suunto band for X6M,"First of all, I replaced the leather band and got the Plastic/elastomer (whatever its made of) which a watch like this should've come with in the first place.Now when I go bicycling or hiking and sweat I can just rinse and dry it off. Leather bands retain sweat and begin to smell, this band was made for activesports.Only complaint I would have is that the buckle is a bit tight when pushing the non-buckle side of strap through but it does hold band in place very well.Only other thing is on watches like this the band has to be watch specific so you can't just put any straight ended band on, it has to be specific, like mostor all of the Nixon watches."
3,It looks good.,It looks good. And it is convenient to strap on and off.But installation is hard to DIY. The Strap is little bit rigid.You have to cut the strap to fit your wrist after installation on watch .
4,Great,"Best watch on the planet, only downfall is the band, this is my third replacement, they last 1-2 years depending on how hard you are with it, so is okay, wish it didn't need to be replaced at all!"
5,"Suunto quality, works perfectly","This Suunto Wrist-Top Computer Watch Replacement Strap Kit is exactly like the original, as you would expect. Same quality and design."
2,Very difficult,"It was very difficult to replace the original broken straps with the new ones. It took me about 1:30 hours using specialized tools. Besides that, the product material feels/weights different. I am not sure if that's how it supposed to be."
1,Great watch and mediocre straps,"I have a metal case X6hr watch and is excellent. But the quality of the straps is inversely proportional. They are very expensive and have a very short useful life, specially if you do outdoor sports. Even the steel and titanium straps break. I hope someday the engineers that designed the watch could manufacture at least average-quality straps. In seven years using the watch I have purchased about five straps and they invariably break."
2,As described but missing the pins!,"Got the strap and it fits the watch - problem is that it was missing the pins!! Had to use the old pins from my old strap, but since this watch requires 1 extra pin, I'm left with the watch waiting to get a pin from somewhere. No good."
1,Great watch terrible band,"I love my watch! But I have to buy a new band every year. They break in exactly the same place time after time. At this point I have spent about $200 on replacement bands (the cheapest ones only)--each one lasts about a year or so. You look on the Suunto web site and find lots of people with the same problem. You have to wonder why they do not read the reviews and take some action to upgrade their product. Still I love my watch, but would probably have chosen a different one if I had know about the quality of the bands. I just hate spending 40 bucks on something that costs so little to manufacture - and is of poor quality. If the band would cost $10 - $15 to replace I would not be complaining--the value is just not $40."
2,Engineering/Design flaw in the Breakfast Chiller,"I have most of the Fit N Fresh line and I love them, but there is a design flaw in the Breakfast Chiller. I would like it if someone could tell me if there is something wrong with the one I have, or if this is a general problem. When the chill ring is frozen, the milk cup will no longer fit all the way into the ring, which in turn means that the top cereal part will not screw onto the bottom bowl. It all fits together nicely when the chill ring is thawed...but that sort of defeats the purpose. I was surprised at this problem, since most of the Fit N Fresh products seem to be very cleverly engineered."
3,Good...but...,"This was a good product, however the little bowl and lid inside the set did not close very easily. You have to really push down on it to make sure it seals properly. Other than that it was a good product."
2,Good Concept...Bad Fit,"I bought various Fit & Fresh containers, but this one is not good at all. The concept is good, but once you freeze the ring and try to close the container, well, good luck trying. I even tried to freeze the entire container intact, but as soon as I took it apart to fill it, it still wouldn't close with the ring. Another downside is the top portion where you put the cereal is too small to hold the cereal plus milk...that is unless I put very little cereal inside. Instead I just pour the cereal and milk in the bowl. The spoon is probably the best thing, yes it seemed flimsy at first, but if you pull the spoon out it locks so you can eat with no worries. I still use it, but without the ring it just seems like any other plastic container."
2,"Great idea, but mine doesn't work well","Like other users, I love the idea of this product but have had some problems with the one I have. The cold pack expands too much when frozen, making it impossible to close the bowl securely. Even without the cold pack, the screw-on lid is very tricky to put on correctly and easily pops open. Unlike some other people's, my spoon is easy to use when open, but it fits too tightly in the lid, and must be pried out with a pen each time I use it.I'd recommend passing on this product. I love the idea of several nesting containers, and will keep looking for something like it."
