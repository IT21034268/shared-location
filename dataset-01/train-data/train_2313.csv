3,yummy story...yummy series,"I would say that having read all available Carpathian novels, Dark Melody is the one I love most. Dayan is my favorite character out of all the Carpathian men. He's the perfect hero, and CJ Wentworth is a brave and wonderful heroine. They are fabulously matched. Keep up the wonderful work Ms. Feehan!"
4,Like it...,"It is a good book. It follows the series well, the plot stays with the ones that come before it.The sex scenes are too drawn out, the story line is good though. I have become accustom to skipping the 3-4 page long sex and then starting to read again.I'll continure to buy the dark series, just because I like the stories."
5,Loved this Book,I was fascinated by the story line and the plot. I can't wait to read more of her books.
1,dull book,It was not very good. This is the only one of hers I have not liked. It was dull and slow.
1,Meet the Climax of the book at the beginning,"If your interested in character development this is not the book for you. I was enjoying about the first 20 pages or so but fell into a drowsy stupor during overly dramatic lengthy descriptions about the two main characters romance. After 40 pages they were hooked on each other without any interesting conflict and the rest of the story is BLAH BLAH BLAH boring. Save your money, get a different book."
2,Guilty pleasure gets guiltier...,"I don't know why I read these, they're often awful but I can't seem to help but find them entertaining. The quality varies and I'm afraid this one isn't one of the better ones. (My favorite quote: '...she garnished attention...' What!? She sprinkles it like sprigs of parsley? How about: 'she garnered attention'?) Anyway, I think the stories work out better when the heroine is powerful in some way as in Dark Guardian and Dark Legend. I think this one is comparable to, but somewhat better than, Dark Symphony, one my few non-keepers in this series, and also one in which the heroine had a serious handicap of some kind. Perhaps it precludes interesting conflict when the hero has to coddle the heroine so much."
5,one of my favorites,loved the story. kept me on my toes. I did not want to put it down. It seems to hint of another story line that Ms. Feehan delves into with another of her collections.
5,SHE'S BACK AND BETTER THAN EVER!!!!!!!,"SENSATIONAL!!! WITH DARK MELODY, CHRISTINE FEEHAN RECLAIMED HER THRONE AFTER HER DISAPP0INTING RELEASE OF THE ONLY ONE. THIS BOOK GRABS AT ALL YOUR EMOTIONS, IT MAKES YOU CRY, LAUGH AND JUST FEEL. I HAVE ALL HER BOOKS AND I THINK THIS MAY BE ONE OF HER BEST YET. CAN'T WAIT FOR HER NEXT RELEASE.A MUST BUY!!!!"
3,Wasn't the best,I really liked all of the previous books that christine feehan had written but I was really disappointed with this book. It focused way to much on character who were in the previous books. It was very hard to read with alot of interest. Unlike any of the previous books in the dark series all of which I read in one sitting this one was just boring.
4,Good Read,I can't say this was my favorite book from the carpathian series but I liked it all the same. I thought it was very touching. I really enjoyed seeing the seeing the characters from previous books come together.
1,Boring...,"Of the many words I might use to describe a Feehan book, boring would not be one of them until I read Dark Melody. Perhaps I've read too many of her novels, or perhaps I've just grown bored of the formula: domineering guy, wimpy girl, a psychic bond 'lifemates' etc. But Dark Melody bored me to tears.The heroine Corrine (6 months pregnant), irritated me. She was way too perfect and saintly. The hero Dayan seemed to be a carbon copy of all the other Carpathian guys: ie, over-the-top, possessive, and while protesting that 'he doesn't like to manipulate and control others using his mental powers' somehow managing to do so anyway. The endless exposition about Carpathian men and Carpathian culture was also quite tedious. And just once, just once, I'd like to see a psychic female refuse to 'mate' with one of these controlling jerks (let alone agree to become an instant baby-factory).1 Star. Worse than the last if such a thing were possible."
3,OK but not her best...,"I was looking forward to this book and found myself disappointed. It seemed to drag and was a bit over-wrought. I found myself becoming impatient with the storyline but, I still look forward to more books in the Dark Series. A new reader should not start with this book."
1,ugh,"I used to think that the ""dark"" series was kinda cute, at least after the first 4 or so. This particular book I grabbed off the free table at an Amtrak depot and it became 1 of the 4 books I have never finished. Feehan should have stopped after 4 or 5. These books quickly went from cute to tedious carbon copy.They can't all be good reviews..."
5,"Oh, Happy Day!","For those of us who were unlucky enough to miss the first release of this CD in 1990...this CD was a long time coming! Witty, entertaining score and charming performances by Peter Palmer, Edie Adams, and Stubby Kaye highlight this wonderful CD. Just TRY listening to ""Jubilation T. Cornpone"" and ""Progress is the Root of All Evil"" without laughing once... you can't! Add to it other charmers like ""If I Had My Druthers"", ""Namely You"", Edie and Stubby's comic ""I'm Past My Prime"" and the snappy ""Rag Offen the Bush"" and you have a cast recording that should get fairly frequent play on your CD player."
5,Li'l Abner,"If you like broadway musicals, this one will be perfect for you. Out of the 50's fun musicals following the lines of the music man. Delightful and pleasant the way the great ones usually are from this period. Try the DVD of the movie as well."
5,Li'l Abner,"What a great cd. It came through perfectly. I had looked for it for ages. Thank you, Amazon.I am so pleased."
5,Lil Abner,"A cleverly written musical, that pokes fun at American politics and society. It is as relevant today as when the show first opened on Broadway in 1956."
1,Totally recorded over,"This tape seemed like it had been recorded over. There are bits of Cailou and random bits of a random show that I have never heard or seen of.Since this tape was like $1, I guess thats what I get for ordering something cheap."
4,"Excellent, but confusing...","I really loved the first book, full of adventure, and romantic endevaurs, but I felt so confused by BOTH books because there doesn't seem to be a good-bad conflict. It seems like the two sides are bad, or the Cahor's are a little less bad than the Deverauxs, but there doesn't seem to be clear sides, which confuse me a lot throughout the book, and so do the time-switches. But all in all, I loved the plot and the character distinctions."
3,Not as good as the first one,"I loved the scenes with Nicole in Spain with the Spanish Coven and I anticipated them eagerly when not reading them, but as for the rest of the book, it doesn't quite measure up to the mystical quality of the first book.All of the characters are out of character, the plot moves around way too much, and there are too many new characters to deal with. It didn't feel like the authors' hearts were in this book too much, especially after Nicole was taken to England and Holly sacrificed Hecate.There are a lot of things in this book that aren't quite up to par with the last one, and I haven't even finished reading it. Frankly, I'm too scared to see what is going to happen next because I know that it will be an unpleasant shock rather than a good one.Read it for yourself, though. It may appeal more to you than it does to me."
3,I'm a huge fan of .hack but..,"The amazing storyline continues, but with a few grave disappointments.-Incredibly short. There is only one new server (city)- the dungeons, and fields also haven't changed- the gameplay is also idenicalThe storyline is still very intriguing, especially the DVD..crossovers from the tv show also exist..but due to the fact that it is only on once a week, and at midnight I didn't understand any of it.I gave it three stars because despite the above I really enjoyed it.Definately a rent before you buy..but then you might be able to complete it."
3,Rent First!,"If you found that you liked Infection, chances are still good you might despise Mutation.The subsequent games frequently have a play time of under 10 hours each (at least to get all of the good items).For the prices of PS2 games, you'd expect a bit more gametime such as the incredibly (and unfortunately) LONG Final Fantasy series. The whole Hack series can be shoved into one feature - four is spreading it too thin.The gameplay is fun. Addictive even. Trading, leveling, email - all good.The graphics are so-so. I kinda wish my character looked less like a mommy's boy - I envy the other characters.The sound and music is great!But just don't pay more than $20 for this game - It won't last the weekend.If you want a good series PS2 Game, Xenosaga and its sequels will take that award."
4,"great game, too much static","This is a great game even though it could have been slightly better. For starters the fields look as if they were rushed, The sound crackles when engaged in heavy combat. Now for the pros. The enemys can be like 20x bigger than you and you can be fighting up to 8 enemies at once and defeat them all at once, so it gives you a sense of collosal power. Some of the combat gets so heavy with tornado attacks that it is almost impossible to see what you are attacking. The dark tones and dim lighting in the game gives you a sense of mystery and danger. No matter how strong you get enemies from this versions feilds and dungeons can't be beaten with just on hit. For those you have played the first one the magic goes up to level 3."
3,"Fun, but *way* too short.",".hack/Infection was already kind of short for an RPG, I finished in 30 hours compared to the usual 50-70 for a Final Fantasy type game.But I finished .hack/Mutation in less than 15 hours!?! Sigh. What there is of the game is fun but, frankly, I don't know if I'm going to buy the next two installments..."
3,If you love RPG you must see this!,"This is not an Action or an not RPG this is an RPG only it is cool! and it has not Intel net work this is off line Free! and the best part is that you have no net working to pay! you can play in the seens 'Japanses' or not to hear them talk in that...if you are 'ask' an Qustion in the game and Answer diffrently you well get Diffrent E-mails in the game the more gift that you give the more affactions you get off Another well it is okay but if you Really love RPG you must buy this! and don't fore get Vol 1, and Vol 3, Coming out soon!"
5,Great the first time great the second time,"I got the first game and it was the best rpg i have ever played, and after playing the second game it is just as great if you look over the...vocies this game is the greatist., by the don't erase infections score if you plan to play this game. The only thing i don't like about the game is that you have to be a twin blade charicter. but there is no resean to yake away any stars."
1,Not very good,The author is not well-versed in his subject matter. It's too bad a lot of people will be misinformed.
3,Fair Into to COM,"Problems with book:1) Book should've mentioned up front they were focussing on COM/DCOM with MFC support. Focuses heavily on the MFC side of COM/DCOM, which we do not use.2) Treatment of ATL does not exploit all the work VC6 can do for you.3) Book spends two chapters covering C++ and OOD, which they expect you to already know at anyways. Why not omit those chapters and spend more time talking about what the book truly is about.However, this book did give me a good overview of COM/DCOM. Having read Inside COM and looked at a few others, this book left out a great deal. A good intro book but be sure to have Inside COM side by side with this one.The examples had too much MFC/GUI code. Should focus on COM rather than explaining how MFC works. They also omit how to set up your projects in VC6. VC6 can do a lot of the prework ahead for you and they consistently failed to utilize it."
2,Leaves out important code / project settings,"I must admit I have just read the 5 first chapters these last 3 days and I feel I've gained a deeper understanding of COM. - However the authors does not state how to set up the VC++ project settings to get the code to work. - I've been fighting of Linker errors most of the time since I started typing in the code. It may be I am not proficient enough in VC++ but with a little help from the book I could be focusing on COM instead of VC++ quirks.Some of the code included <iostream> and <string> libraries but did not have ""using namespace std"" in the printed code. Since I have just been studying namespaces this was not the biggest problem for me.I went to www.mcp.com to fetch updates but I was very dissapointed that there was no updates there.Even though I feel that the book has allready given me more in depth insight in COM I am dissapointed that I have to spend a lot of time browsing the CD-project code to see what made the samples work."
5,Good for fast learning,"Good book since the concepts are covered with real programs. One can get fundamental of COM/DCOM in record time. I did not know what COM/DCOM before reading it but just in 15 days I mastered the concepts. However, the writers could have avoided unnecessary detailed programming which does not incorporate materials of COM/DCOM. It took me some time to figure out what part of the codes are relevant and what not. It wasted my time and energy in locating relevant portions in the code"
2,Watch out,"The source code in chapter 3 does not compile under VC++ 6. The author uses STL libraries for <string> and <iostream> but does not add: using namespace std; in his code in the book, but he does on the CDROM. His code on the CD ROM greatly varies from what is in the book. What gives?! Of course Waite Press (MCP) does not offer any ""errata"" or updates. I will NEVER buy an MCP book again! Also in chapter three the author says to compile the DLL....where did this DLL suddendly come from? I though we were making console EXEs? No help, not worth it."
3,"Nice shoes, but not high quality","These shoes are very cute, but they don't look like they'll last long. I just received them last week and already the strap it getting wrinkled and worn looking. They also scuff very easily. They are quite attractive though, and if you're careful they will stay looking nice for awhile at least."
2,NOT AS ADVERTISED,"Did not recieve the Magic Kingdom, I recieved Disney Land (california). I didnt have either so I kept it vs returning it but since it was a gift I was disappointed."
5,"Smashing cars, smashing cars ...","Forget the kids - I fell in love with this book for the first time at age 35! I ""discovered"" it on the discards table at my library. Intrigued by the rather lengthy title (which is an apropos summary of the story), I read the book on the spot and wouldn't let anyone else touch it! Delighted, I shared it with my co-workers, who thought it equally as delightful and tried to get me to part with it. Combine simplistic illustrations, a silly story, with a hint of a plot twist and you've got this zany yet charming story that will tickle funny bones of kids no matter their age!"
5,Kids Love it,"This is such a wonderful book for the preschool aged child. I use it in my programs and never fail to get the children joining in with the song. For children who are not able to speak, they can join in the fun with some fun actions"
1,Picture is misleading - thought i was getting a drum (not just the top),I'm not an experienced drummer. Thought a drum would be a great gift but to my surprise when it arrived there was a TOP ONLY! Picture should be changed. Can't comment on the product - just want anyone reading this to know it's not a drum!
3,Exercise caution with the version you purchase! Dubbed.,"This movie was originally filmed in Catalan, but the version generally available in the US is dubbed in Spanish. Which means it has all the annoying characteristics of films that are dubbed. What a disappointment!"
5,"""Time Limit""!!","""time Limit"" is one of my favorite songs of hers,""For you"" is just ok,but i like them both becuase they are definatley r&b.;she should have debuted in the US back then around 99-2001 with songs like these."
1,I do not agree,"This just appears to be new line cashing in on whatever they can get their hands on. Even the description doesn't make sense, if we get all technical, Arwen is no longer an immortal elf. And why does she have to have butterflys in her hair? How typical of mattel, when they don't have anything to use they throw in stars, butterflys, or unicorns. I do not consider this a collector's item for LOTR fans, and it shouldn't be called one."
1,REPULSIVE,THIS IS REPULSIVE!!!BARBIE ARAGORN AND ARWEN??????i'd like to think that LOTR is serious enough to not have barbies made out of it!!!support a good cause and dont buy this trash.
1,It's just plain WRONG!!!!,"How could anyone make Barbie Arwen and Aragorn dolls, that is wrong on so many levels!Tolkien did not write the Lord of the Rings to have dolls made out of his characters to be played with by 2 year olds who can not even start to grasp what the Lord of the Rings is about and the fact that Tolkien was a genius!People should not by this it is just offending! I mean honstly Barbie itself is just lame, but they don't have to bring in a brilliant film and book into their stupid toys made to amuse stupid 2 year olds!!!! Come on now honestly, I just can't believe they did that!!! Grrrrrr..."
2,Less Stinky Than The Movie?,"The only reason I wanted to get my hands on this was to see what Bill Sienkiewicz did with ""Dune"". The art is a bit of a disappointment.This dates from the period when Sienkiewicz was transitioning from a comic-book artist who aped Neal Adams almost slavishly, to a guy who had his own unique groove.Sienkiewicz still has the training wheels on his bicycle here, and you can tell.To see what Sienkiewicz is truly capable of, I would suggestStray Toastersor better yet,Elektra: Assassin.As far as this book being a comic-book adaptation of David Lynch's movie ""Dune"", I wouldn't bother. Where the film truncated the novel into a confusing mess, the additional limits imposed on this slim book, make this into a Cliff Notes version of ""How Not To Make A Movie"".Not worth the time or investment."
4,Great sounds and great guys,"I stumbled upon Sev by accident - I took my daughter to see Nick Carter and Sev was an opening act. They were incredible! I bought their CD on the spot and have been listening to it constantly since. As some of the other reviews mention, Sev's style is nothing new - but that's not a bad thing. They employ a dual-vocalist system that makes each song an interesting weave of the two vocalists' styles. The musicianship represented on the album is also impressive. The guitar and bass parts speak up when they should and stand back when they should - proving that the classic metal guitar sound can be subtle as well as prominent. I even enjoyed the drums, as the drummer likewise demonstrates that tons of noise with a huge kit does not have to be made to accompany a rock band effectively. Lots of different influences can be heard on this album, and the band members deftly weave a great album - one of the few I own that I can listen to all the way through."
2,limp bizkit's children,"title says it all, except limp bizkit may be a little to angry for them.theyre great for a show full of good charlotte loving 15 year olds, but im past that crap.save your money."
1,"No negative reviews? Well, this looks like a job for me!","I'd hate to burst everyone's soda-bubble of buzz on this band, but this is the kind of music that listeners passed over two years ago. This band is just like others that came out in 2000-01 (Insolence, No One) that were so generic and faceless that everyone has forgotten about. Sev are the epitome, the cliche, the poster-boys for new-millennium rap-metal. Problem is, this genre is four years stale. If this had come around when Limp Bizkit were still popular, no doubt it would have sold like gold. It's pretty sad when you have to use a Pepsi-blue commercial to push your album (Of course, it doesn't seem to be working for Papa Roach). Seriously, don't buy this album. It's like buying a Winger album in 1994. Just makes no sense."
5,Additional info,"This is the official, complete soundtrack to the Laurel & Hardy movie OUR RELATIONS. A 44-page booklet contains never-before-published photographs, and liner notes by Richard W. Bann. A must have for fans of the Laurel & Hardy Music Boxset by The Beau Hunks."
1,Video Poker & Slots,"Disliked - was looking for a video poker cd with a variety of games (I especially like Dueces Wild versions) and this has only one version. BORING!! There are only 2 types of slot machines and the wild symbols don't count unless you get three - not like a casino machine where you can get double or triple win amount with a wild symbol. BORING -- but I'm a video poker addict. Give me DUECES or FOUR ACES with a higher payout. If someone is looking for an inexpensive basic game, this does nicely."
3,"""sequels""","my wife loves china o'brien, i think it's a bit too ""asian"" with all the facial affects and grunts and sounds. sounds like a low budget fiasco."
5,This is just excellent,"This book should be recommended for anyone who wants to learn some Gaelic. It is easy to use and has excellent information. It would supplement any course admirably, especially for conversation purposes."
1,Tabs too small,Many of the tabs (roughly 1-5 and 16-21) are too small to effectively label. This is only adequate if the preprinted numbers 1-31 are exactly the labels you want.
1,tune buddies,I am sorry I bought it. If the silly kitchen stuff was not in it it would be useful but as it is I cannot use it for my students.
3,Has a light that is permanently on.,"This GFCI is designed with an indicator light that is permanently on.(The same light is also on if you miswire the GFCI - which is confusing.)But I really don't need little lights staying on all the time.They should redesign it like other GFCIs which turn on the light when the GFCI trips.So now I have two kinds of GFCIs: one kind has the light on when it's good, the other kind has the light on when it bad. Just great, I'm supposed to memorize which outlets are which?Also the screw terminals are very hard to use. If you want to backwire it's great - better than other devices. But if you like to use the terminals be prepared to waste extra time. The screw will not stay raised above the outlet, but falls into the device. So you have to hold the outlet upside down to make the terminal come out. It doable of course, just takes extra time.Be aware these GFCI are not for use outdoors. Really. They are indoor only. For outdoor use you need the WR version."
1,Avoid Leviton GFCI,"The floating side wire screws are a pain in the butt, and almost guarantee insecure wire installation - serious product design defect.But worse... I just spent 2 hours installing, uninstalling and trouble-shooting, one of these units only to find it was defective right out of the box. Good thing the defect only caused it to not work. Would have been real serious if the defect prevented the GF from properly functioning, or if there was an internal short.There's a reason many of the retail home improvement stores have stopped carrying Leviton (too many defective returns)... and why most reputable electricians won't touch the stuff. Poor design and really poor off-shore (China) manufacturing - the quality is outrageously bad.Do yourself a favor and avoid Leviton products."
5,Quality Receptacle,"I used this for an outdoor application with a waterproof while in use cover. It works fine, and the receptacle seems to be of good quality. The free super saver shipping saved a trip to the store."
5,Thumbs-Up,"This is a very good product for a decent price. I had 2 outlets malfunctioning outlets outside the house and used these to replace them. Was easy to install and so far had no problems with them. Of course you should have an idea about how to replace an outlet, they don't come with a fool proof installation guide"
4,Does the job!,"I was looking for a low cost solution to address home inspection issue prior to the sale of my residence. This was one of the lower cost GFCIs available. They work just fine, and offered in 3 colors."
5,great product,"Excellent product, easy to install and continues to work well. Has already tripped a few times, so I can't tell you how important this product is."
3,I have had two fail in the past year,"I like the look and price. I don't care where it is made. But I have had two fail in the past year. We installed new electrical two years ago with new 400amp service, new panels, full kitchen, laundry, and bath remodels. Our licensed electrician installed about 10 of these throughout the house. Today I am replacing two of them that have failed. I'll replace with the same model to match the look but I am less than happy with them right now.I like the Hubbel units with two LEDs better. At least you can tell if there is still power applied when the LED goes out."
5,This is a great book,"I've been really impressed with this book. I'm almost done reading it and will definitely go back and read it a few more times, and refer to it often. Having just met with a business consultant who would charge $24K a year for similar-sounding coaching, I'm really impressed by how much sound, logical, but also simple and memorable/doable advice the author offers in this book. She makes tons of great, practical, straight-forward points, and it isn't just rah-rah stuff that you'll forget about shortly after you read it. Very good stuff. The author seems like someone who's walked her talk, too, which is always helpful. Great, and very business-oriented, as opposed to just personal growth/personal coaching-oriented, like Cheryl Richardson's stuff. (This book might be a great combination with one of Cheryl's books, too, for the complete package: self-help on a business and a personal level. Very congruent.)"
2,Curious,Does it seem strange to anyone that all of the 26 reviews for this book sound exactly the same? Almost like the same person wrote all of the reviews.......or coached others on how to write them.....hmmm...
5,Good Book!,"If you feel that you work to hard and earn to little, this book is for you. Jennifer White shows you how to be more effective in whatever you do. When you become more effective--you will start earning more money-because your more effective, more valuable. Jennifer is one of the top coaches in the nation and it's not for no reason. Her methods are sound. Proven. They Work. Highly recommended.Zev Saftlas, Author of Motivation That Works: How to Get Motivated and Stay Motivated"
5,The Answer,"If you keep asking yourself, how can I make more money, how can I can have more time, how can I do more things that I enjoy - then this book will give you the answer you are looking for. I have read dozens of business/career books and not until I read this book did I say to myself ""Oh, of course, that is what I should do"". In fact, I look at my life now as pre- and post- Work Less Make More! You should buy enough copies for all your friends and family."
3,"Has some good info, but really only for business owners","Full disclosure: I didn't finish this book entirely. Which is exactly why I am giving it a less than stellar review.This book has a few tidbits of good information for everyone, but most of it, in my opinion, would only be helpful to you if you work for yourself or own your own business. If you are an employee working 9-5 (as most of us probably are), there isn't much in this book for you.Also, I found the book in general to be somewhat boringly written. Hence I didn't finish it."
2,For Business Owners and Sales People,"While there is value for most sprinkled throughout the book, this really is for business owners. Not good at accounting? Then hire someone who is! Too busy to organize your office? Have your assistant do it! Overwhelmed with necessary tasks, but tasks that do not capitalize on your brilliance? It's time to add staff! Delegate, delegate, delegate. . . Does your job offer the option to directly add and/or reallocate resources? If not, this is not the book for you."
4,Space Mtn - A cool ride.,"When I first got Space Mtn's debut release I didn't know what to expect. Dina Waxman and Chris Jacks put together a fantastic collection of stirring melodies and hauntingly beautiful vocals. Waxman comes across damaged yet cheery, depressed yet hopeful and this range of emotions flows throughout the album like, well a thrill ride full of surprises. Take ""Oh"" for example, starting off like a campy caberet song then suddenly punches you in the chest and takes your wallet leaving you confused and oddly satisfied. Lots of genuine hooks lie within solid alt-pop tracks like ""The Bright Side"", ""Next Time"", ""I Die"" and the single ""Hovercraft"" woven with layered, well-crafted arrangements. A Drawing of a Memory of a Photograph of You is an excellent alternative to the ready-made top-40 alt-pop consuming the airwaves. And Space Mtn is worth standing in line for."
1,Don't Be Fooled,"Don't be fooled by this meretricious imitation of reasoning. It is arrogant, self-righteous and pretentious. The haughty Haught sets up a straw man he calls ""you,"" who is supposedly an ""evolutionary materialist,"" he presumes to put thoughts into ""your"" head that no rational person would ever really think, and proceeds to amass pages of empty verbiage to discredit his false assumptions. I recognize this smarmy, self-satisfied, aggressive tone from high-flown Republican rhetoric and Fox News, both of which are convinced they have a monopoly on ""truth"" (a word Haught uses repeatedly). The Democratic attitude is essentially scientific: I don't know the truth, but here's the best view I can come up with based on the currently available evidence. Maybe that's why the Democrats always seem to be at a loss to counter Republican certainties."
2,tokyo marui clone,i ordered from opa and didnt receive the charger to load the bb's so i have to load them one by one which sucks.
3,Reasonable Device for the Price,"Before making any decision on a digital music player you need to determine which jukebox/on-line music store you want to use. This device is fully supported by Windows Media Player and integrates very nicely with it.This digital music player is a price competitor. The device comes with a reasonable amount of memory and all of the necessary accessories to earn it a bargain rating.There are some weaknesses with the player:1. While the device accepts an expansion SD memory card, it does not pool it or join it with the internal card. You need to select which card you want to play music from and cannot automatically change from one to the other while playing music.2. The device's controls are packed together, very small and flimsy. This presents a consistent irritant.3. The devices original firmware is very problematic. New firmware is available to rectify a host of issues."
4,Good buy,"After reading the experiences of other reviewers here i was persuaded that my Kingston Elite Pro 1Gb SD card would work with this player, and it does! Decent sound quality and replaceable AAA battery makes this a good buy."
4,Great mp3 player,"I love this mp3 player! The buttons are durable and easy to use while exercising. In fact, I sold my Creative Muvo TX series because I hated the buttons. They felt cheap.The Muvo Sport's backlight is helpful. I can read the display with ease. I've heard people complain of bugs in reading an external memory card. I bought a 512 mb memory card and the product had no trouble recognizing the expanded memory. The drag and drop feature is so easy to use. The only reason I gave it four stars was I had to purchase different headphones. The earbud type did not fit in my small ears and were a bit uncomfortable for me. They kept falling out when I jogged. So I bought some RCA clip-on ones and they work great!Also the armband is nice. It keeps the product secure during exercise. I'd highly recommend this product to someone who wants to use it for exercise. It's water resisistant too!"
3,Poor controls,Opt for the MuVo Micro N200 which is a superior player. I found the controls of the Sport difficult to manipulate (felt spongy and were not responsive) and were illogical or at least took more concentration to manipulate than what I like. I ended up giving the MuVo Sport away.
4,Creative Muvo Sport C100,"Hey I've had this mp3 player for about a year and it works great. The Creative Muvo is super tough and work great if your out running or whatever. Even though it's water resistant they don't suggest dropping it in the water, but i've dropped it in a river once and it works just fine. This player is great if you have a small music collection but if you have a bunch of songs don't get it (even though you can put a lot of songs on it it doesn't have a scroll option) If your buying for the radio option don't buy it because i've found that the radio doesn't work very well and also the volume doesn't go very high."
2,"everybody is different,what works for some,might not for others.","I too have severe crohnes disease and have taken every medicationfrom prednisone to remecade.The remecade works but i was veryconcerned about prescription drugs and thought there must be amore natural alternative.Now I take vitamin and mineral suplements, omega fatty acids,digestive enzimes,green food supplements and a few others to keep myself alkaline. As longas I keep my acid-alkaline levels in the alkaline side (about ph6 to ph7) my crohnes disease remains in remission.(2 years no meds)."
5,"Moon Demon, by Lynne Ewing","Vanessa Cleveland is a girl blessed with the ability to become invisible. She is a Daughter of the Moon, along with Catty, Serena, Jimena, and Tianna. Lately Vanessa has been feeling cut off from her friends, and she's not sure why. It doesn't help matters much that her sixteenth birthday is coming up--meaning she is one year closer to making the most important decision of her life. No wonder she's feeling down!Catty (Vanessa's best friend since childhood) has been hanging out a lot with Tianna, whom Vanessa has never fully gotten to like. Even Michael, her boyfriend, seemed to have changed. Then Vanessa meets Hector. He's dangerous, exciting, and different from anyone she has ever met. He shows her a secret side to herself that she was always afraid of. It leaves her shaken, but she can't deny the truth in Hector's words.I would give this book 6 stars if I could. Vanessa's bravery was very admirable, and the book's plot was great! I enjoyed this book a lot!"
5,Vanessa's story continues,Right as soon as the demon appears you know which guy he is but Vanessa doesn't have a clue because Michael has been acting weird. Later she finds out that Michael is out of town and the Michael she's been seeing isn't the real Michael. But that's not all the story. She sacrifices everything to save her friends and she also discovers something new about herself.
3,Vanessa really get me frustrated,"I've been going back and reading the summaries of each book because the events aren't as memorable as you'd think. I keep forgetting all sorts of important stuff that's happened in like, every book, and that's pretty unusual. One thing I definately remember is my feeling of frustration while reading this Daughters if the Moon book. Vanessa is really oblivious and almost selfish in this book, and isn't thinking hard enough. For someone who is in constant danger she wasn't being as catious as she should have been. I've never really liked Vanessa that much, and this just sealed the deal. I liked the book alright though, just not the character. But, I guess she is probably the most realistic of them all. I like Catty and Tianna much more either way. This review wasn't very helpful, i know, but I just wanted to get this out there."
5,What about Stanton,I loved this book! It was romantic and mysterous. Vanessa goes from who she thinks is Micheal but is really a rejected regulator hired by Stanton to protect her to Hector a mysterous but perfect guy she meets while investigating about missing girls. As her liking of Hector grows the more she thinks her friends are turning against her. She is one night after Catty visits her from the future burned by what looks like a fire serpent. The burn grows and turns into this big tatoo all the way up her arm. What she does know is that it is helping Hector who is really the DEMON get closer to his quest. Here is my question why could Serena see Stanton and that he is not betraying her? You must read the rest of the book to find out what happens in the end.
2,This may be the last...,"This may be the last DOM book I ever read. I'm sick and tired of having the goddesses get into hopeless situations then getting out so easily! I mean come on! the bands on her wrists just crumble off so easily it seems like no effort! And then-this is the worst part- Lynn Ewing keeps up with that repeating nonsense...yes!!! we remember selena had a relationship w/ stanton; yes we know what vanessa's*and others'* powers are! Stop being so repetitive! I can't stand it anymore!If you really don't care about any of the stuff i mentioned then get the book! But those of you who don't feel like wasting your money on a book that has many *big* flaws, i suggest discontinue buying the books."
5,Moon Demon,"As Vanessa's birthday approaches she begins feeling left-out. Her friends always seem to be busy with something when she calls and are always leaving her out. Michael's acting weird, Stanton's helping her and Hector, the gorgeous new guy she meets, seems more and more irresistable everytime she meets him. Is there something Maggie didn't tell her? Why won't the stupid tatoo go away? And will she ever tell Michael what she wants for her birthday?"
4,review of the review,"the book is a fine example of Toby Peters. But the reviewer should know that Gunther, the midget, is not Norwegian; he is Swiss."
2,Too Slow-Paced,I just bought this video and I am disappointed after working out for 45 minutes I didn't even break a sweat. I love the Crunch Boot Camp video - it's a great quick workout video but I wanted a video with more time this one is not it. I am ready to sell this video now. I am looking for a good workout video 45-60 minutes that will work the entire body and give you a good sweat.
4,Fun and Effective,"I really love the Crunch workout videos because the instructors are always fun and motivating. This one really works a lot of muscle groups I didn't know I had. But, I have seen results from using it at least once a week. I feel stronger and my clothes fit better so I would say it is a success. My schedule is so busy that it is sometimes hard to squeeze this one in, but when I do have time, it is refreshing and fun. I recommend it if you really want to tone your muscles on your entire body."
1,Not worth the money.,"It does give off alot of light, but it is more of a spot light. The lava lamp part does not work really well either. It's not worth the money in my opinion."
5,Exciting New Voice,"Newcomer Shannon Lawson brings an exciting new voice to country music, although his music transcends the country designation. Songs on this new release showcase a diverse talent; some songs have a R & B flavor, some showcase his bluegrass background, and a number of them are destined to become standards in the industry. I love the range and strength of his voice. Get on the bandwagon early and treat yourself to this first release by a young man I predict will become a superstar."
4,It's not his fault,"I admit that this album is a little too ""Music Row"" for my taste, but I've known Shannon and followed his music for years and ""YES"" he is the real deal. This guy can blow your mind with only a guitar and a song. If you take out the buzzers and whistles, you're left with a very talented singer songwriter who can out-sing any of these so called country artist. Give Shannon a chance and don't count him out just yet. If you know anything about the music business, you know that sometimes the artist will have to bow to the radio gods and sacrifice that wonderful raw sound that got him there in the first place. Please support Shannon and give this record a second listen. You won't be sorry."
5,What a great new talent!!!!,"Shannon's new album is incredible! You can feel his passon for music right off the bat with track number one, "" This Old Heart."" He does a great cover of Marvin Gaye's, ""Let's Get It On"". My two favorite songs on the album are, ""Who's Your Daddy and Superstar."" Who's your Daddy just makes you wanna sing along at the top of your lungs and dance around! Superstar is a very sweet song that Shannon wrote for his wife. Overall, this album is worth spending the money on. Shannon Lawson is a future Superstar."
2,I agree with the editorial review.,"Shannon Lawson is capable of a much better album. I saw him down in Nashville when he was with the Galoots, and it was amazing! If they were to put out a CD I'm sure it would be one of my favorites. Shannon has a voice and a talent for bluegrass music and that's what Nashville should have let him do on his first solo CD. Instead they gave it this generic, overproduced sound, leaving Shannon sound like everyone else. With the way bluegrass is selling these days, it's a shame that Shannon couldn't showcase his enormous talent in the proper arena..."
5,I love this album!,"I was in Border's listenting to different music albums, and I just happened to listen to this CD...it grabbed me immediately! I didn't know who this Shannon Lawson guy was, but I knew he was awesome! Now, I listen to this CD all the time...I'm a big fan now! I definitely recommend you add this one to your collection...you'll love it!"
4,the editorial is the work that sucked,"... I recently lisened to Shannon Lawson, and I loved it all! He is a great mix of rock and country, with a little bluegrass mixed in. ... It is the best CD I have heard in a long time!"
5,Amazing new talent found!!!!,I don't feel that I really need to say a lot about CHASE THE SUN because once you listen to it you will understand just how great of a collection tunes it is! Shannon puts so much emotion and hard work into his music that it just pulls you in and you completly get lost in it. I highly recommend it to everyone!
2,Aegypan Version,"This version contains NO ILLUSTRATIONS. The previous review of this edition must have actually been for a different one.As this is a book that was originally illustrated, the description SHOULD indicate that it contains none of the original artwork."
4,Fundamental writing with some insider's tips thrown in,"YOU CAN WRITE A MYSTERY is, at the core, a fiction-writing basics book that applies to any subject. Author Gillian Roberts includes tips that apply specifically to mystery writing, but that would enrich any story.This book is excellent for those who wish to begin writing and need a place to start. The book includes enough information to get you well on your way to writing a mystery (or any fiction you want to supercharge with a little suspense). The tone is clear and concise, and the author conveys her experience in both writing and reading mysteries, giving formulas and ""sleight of hand"" tricks for muddling your readers."
4,A good companion,"This is a practical guide to the process of writing a mystery novel. It can be a guide for begginers, it turns very useful if you already have a plot or an idea to develop. I found it a bit of brief in matter of structure and form, but it can be a good companion turning your idea a real mystery, and not to forget some basics characteristics of the genre. Is simply a guide that can be re-readable."
2,Shallow & Poorly Edited,"I enjoyed Ferling's Leap In The Dark immensely. It was a well-written, far-reaching, grand book that formed a great cohesive work. As such, i figured this book (about a very under-reported time-period in US history) would be a slam-dunk. Not so. It's almost as if Ferling expended so much energy with Leap that he decided to phone this one in. It's incohesive, jumping around with little regard to logical continuity. Yet, even at this, it comes off as a shallow non-scholarly work that is better suited to a magazine article than a book. I was about ready to have Ferling join McCullough & Ellis as authors i would count on to deliver quality consistently. Alas, not quite yet."
4,Essential Reading for Anyone Interested in the Founding of this Country,"This is not a romanticized version of American history where our Founding Fathers deserve sainthood. Rather it is a well told, well researched, and balanced story of an dynamic era when men of competing visions battled for the future of this country. Another good book by Ferling."
2,Price watch,"Excellent book!! My only concern is a ""list price"" on Amazon of $19.99, which is a paper sticker overlying the book's listed price of $14.95 - so that the discount is in fact $1.I would expect somewhat less devious pricing from Amazon!"
4,Crisis history,"A readable and detailed survey, not just of the immediate crisis of the tied Jefferson-Burr election, but of the development of American politics in its earliest stages -- a more relaxed world; President Adams spent months at home in Mass. But in that era too, politics was a game played with very sharp knives. Strongly partisan against Hamilton, Adams, and even Washington, Ferling can be said to ""vote for Jefferson on every page."" Solid history enlived by human detail, but somewhat marred by anachronistic jargon -- 18th century pamphleteers are ""bloggers""?!"
4,You think OUR Elections are bad?,"Pundits always talk about the 'Golden Age' of politics, when the candidates respected each other and the elections were decided by sober reflection on the relative merits of the nominees. Nonsense. Our current crop of politicians are rank armatures compared to the antics our Founding Fathers got up to. You have Alexander Hamilton, trying to play king-maker and shafting John Adams in the process. You have Thomas Jefferson, benign statesman in public, scheming politician behind the scenes. John Adams doesn't hesitate to turn on his old friend Jefferson (it is believed that this is when the Sally Hemings rumors got started). And God help us when it all ends up in the House of Representatives and Arron Burr decides that, you know, maybe he COULD be President and refuses to yield to Jefferson. Why do our history textbooks leave out all the good stuff?"
2,Very slow,"I simply did not enjoy this book. That's not to say I got nothing out of it, because the information is there. But halfway through the book, I briefly considered putting it down and moving on to something else. It's just not written in a way that is reader friendly. It reads like something written by a historian, not a writer. The best books are written by those who wear both hats."
2,Horses have no place in this book,"I believe that a vast amount of viable space is wasted on horses in this book. While they technically are large animals, they're so vastly different from cattle that they deserve and have their own books which are great.I think this book isn't very well written and doesn't go into the pathology of diseases very well... at all. I hate the layout, and I think some ideas are just skimmed over or not mentioned at all.I would not recommend this book, but the problem is there isn't another one out there."
2,Poor picture quality,The camera takes pictures so slowly that you can't take a picture of anything moving or it will just be a blur. The only good thing about this camera is it's direct print capability. Don't by this camera if you plan on taking pictures of anything other than something holding perfectly still.
1,you could take better pictures on a camera phone,"As mentioned in the other reviews, the photo quality is TERRIBLE. All the photos I've ever taken are blurry and the color balance is way off. It's a complete waste of money."
5,This movie was the reason I started Tae-Kwon-Do!!,"Cynthia Rothrock was one of the reasons I started doing Tae-Kwon-do.I got to red belt and won a few sparring tournaments,though the storyline is campy,the martial arts performance is excellent!I also recommend all of Bruce Lee's movies and Best of the Best 1 for martial arts fans who like old school fighting!!"
1,Do you like bad movies?,"Cynthia Rothrock is China O'Brien, an LAPD martial arts instructor who resigns from the police after killing a kid. She goes home where her dad is the local sheriff. Dad gets killed and she runs for sheriif. Then it is all mindless fighting. The fight scenes are awful. China beats fat trailer trash who sail backwards every time she flicks out a kick.This is a so bad it is good kind of a movie. You just laugh through it. You know: Hey why is that guy speaking in an Australian accent all of a sudden? Sure a three hundred pound guy is going to sail 10 feet from Cynthia's kick."
2,"My, oh my...","My wife rented this recently just so that she could see Keith Cooke, a martial artist whose work she admires. (He's of mixed Japanese and American descent, but he plays a Native American martial artist here.) Do not see this for the plot, the acting, the setting, or if you like movies with characters you actually care about. Do see it if you want to watch a female martial artist beat the snot out of a bunch of rednecks. There is no other point to this movie."
5,A beautiful myth,"My mother always called herself black Irish and after viewing this movie I hope she was refering to this wonderful myth. No violence,fighting or cursing. Wonderful background music. Story brought a tear to my eyes at the end. I would love to read the book but for $250.00 it is too expensive. Hope someone will put out a new edition."
4,Core Secrets,I have used this product at my exercise group and it is great! I bought this copy to have at home so my 10 year old son and I can do this together. He's not old enough for the gym but needs to lose weight. Plus I get to spend time with him; which is good for both of us! Thanks for getting it to me so quickly.
5,Core Secrets - DVD Workout,This DVD allows you to workout at different levels. The individuals leading the workout session are easy to follow and the narrative is great. It is my favorite workout DVD.
5,Great Workout,This is a great workout ! You have the option to shuffle the workout with accelerated..
5,Fabulous!,"I think these are great workout dvd's. I purchased one for my mom, and my friend, and myself!! I would recommend this workout to anyone!!"
4,Good workout,If you're looking to not overdo it then this 25 minute workout is for you. I work out a little harder in the morning and use this at the end of the day. Haven't tried the full workout yet.
5,Mountain of Fire,"This is an extremely interesting documentary about the search for the real Mount Sinai in the book of Exodus in the Bible. The evidence they found is amazing and compelling, and the site is not on the Sinai Peninsula as is listed on most biblical maps. The video is very well done and answers a lot of age old questions with real evidence. It totally coroborates the Exodus story, including the parting of the Red Sea story in an almost Indiana Jones-type adventure. Presented in a non-sectarian way, it's a must see for Jews, Christians and anyone interested in archaeology and history. Fascinating!"
3,dresser,It looks nice but can tell it is made cheaply. The delivery was terrible. Had to pay the driver to bring it into the house.
2,The Illustrations are Nice,"The best part about this book are the illustrations; they are rich in color and texture and give a really great sense of the richness of the character. The text, however, is wordy and is not well-suited for those of a picture-book age. There are text boxes to highlight important 'messages,' about kindness, friendship, mood, etc., and the overall impression is that the author is preaching to the reader. Instead of intertwining a story with a subtle message, the text is explicit and overly explanatory. The length of the book (50 pages) is far beyond what a normal toddler/preschooler will enjoy, and there is just way too much text in the story. The book requires tightening. Not recommended."
2,Beautiful illustrations - good intentions - lazy writing,"I absolutely love the illustrations in this book. The story, however, reads like it was made up in less than five minutes. The character names are just irritating. Imagine saying Lotsa de Casha over... and over... and over. Just try reading this book out loud before you buy it (since, after all, this is a children's book.) The English Roses is much better written."
2,NOTTA FOR YOUNG KIDSA,LOVED THE PICTURES...IN ORDER FOR THE STORY TO WORKA YOU HAVE TO SPEAKA WITH A WIERDA.... ACCENTA SO ITS NOTTA FOR KIDSATOO MUCH SLANGA
1,Ho Hum,"Why would adults rate this book based on what they like? I'm glad that I didn't buy this. It bored my 4 year old daughter (AND her pals) senseless. This *IS* aimed at kids, so if they don't enjoy it..."
1,lotsa cash buys lotsa promotion,"so lotsa cash can't buy happiness, but it CAN buy major promotion.If you want your pre-schoolers and toddler kids to get a fundamental understanding of money and ethical issues, try ""What is Money?"" by Etan Boritzer."
5,madonna reads her story at my school,"hi, i would love for madonna to read her book at my school in irvington, n.j. i am a teacher of art and would love to have her read and show the illustrations to my classes. i heard that she read a book at a school in monclair and got the idea when i heard about this."
4,Lotsa de Casha,"The book is beautiful, the art is great, the message the book conveys is a very good concept for children to adopt; however, it failed to get much attention from my 6-year-old twin granddaughters. After offering to read the book to them several times, I finally gave up trying. They were not interested.In addition, there were several areas I felt were poorly edited."
3,It's a toss up!,"If you love/like Madonna, please don't get this book unless you are (1) interested in what's going on in children's literature or (2) have children. This is not ""Vogue"" of kiddie books by any means. If it were to be compared to any of her music, it would be her ""American Life"" album which is very simple and message driven music (and very good in my opinion but not very radio friendly as we all know!).That said, the book is quite good and has an important message for children (and us all really) told in a charming light. Very appropriate to be read at community story times or even the classroom; no need to fear your child will be sucked into the Kaballah, but good life lessons! I truly enjoyed this book! The illustrations, as with all her books are breathtaking!"
5,Great for character education,"I purchased this book in particular because I own 4 Italian Greyhounds. My oldest is named Madonna because she is so tiny and beautiful and full of grace. It's funny how Madonna-the human wrote a book about an Italian Greyhound- and I say that because the character is Italian. Actually I own all 5 books and am very pleased with her themes. It's a great series to teach good morals for the young and old. I don't care about what people say about the author's past but I am proud of her for living her life to it's fullest. How many of us can really say that and take it to our graves. All of us have had or have skeletons in our closet. She was not afraid to be herself in public and for that I give her great props. OH, and Madonna, if you happen to read this, keep writing because you are truely an artist in all aspects. Hopefully next book will include your illustrations."
2,Whack Wharf Playset,"Booooo. Not fun, don't waste your money on this one. Talk about disappointment. I have searched for cool tub toys for so long and thought for sure I had a winner. Nope! 1)The little clown head doesn't stay on. 2)the beach ball that you squeeze to make the water run down the slide, simply doesn't provide enough umph to get the water really going 3) the slide keeps falling off 4) the suction cups don't hold really well. I took the slide off and now we just pour water into the cup at the top and call it a day."
1,"Cheap, Cheap, Cheap!!!!!","I purchased this toy for my son because as a kid Tub Town was my favorite toy in the world!! I was so excited for him to use it. From the moment I took it out of the packaging I could see how cheaply it was made. So cheap that even the suction cups do not suction for more then a few minutes. The parts that attach don't fit properally and pop off!! The plastic used is flimsy and showed stress marks before it was even used! More then anything, the Tub Town product was a HUGE disappointment!!"
1,Do not buy this phone if you want to hear it ring!,"I agree wholeheartedly with the previous reviewer. This was very disappointing indeed. I bought this phone for its big buttons, loud volume and what seemed like a very easy-to-read Caller ID display. I got that, but what I didn't get was one of the basic functions any phone should have---a standard ringtone! You get 8 options of badly synthesized tunes and not one of them was even remotely palatable to the person I bought it for. In one word... annoying."
1,PHONE caller ID,This phone was a dud....I did not like the ring was only once then the caller ID announced who was calling . The dial tonewas ear piercing...Then the return instructions was not to your advantage to send the phone...I gave it to the SalvationArmy thrift store.
1,Junk phone,It did not work at all. Volume terrible. Did notTalk. Item returned. I was very disappointed in this item
1,The Night Before First Grade,"Sorry I purchased this book, very disgusting topic and was not expecting a book regarding on Picking one's nose. I wish That I can return this book. Have and will NOT read this book for my young students."
5,The Arabian: A Guide for Owners,"This book is absolutely the best book I have ever read about the Arabian Horse.I am a small Bask line breeder and this is my reference book, I have two copies,one I use on a daily basis, and one I purchased to keep because it is signed by Sharon Byford and I will treasure it always."
3,Grandpas place card holder,"A little cheap- but really, it Is a novelty item, right? Grandpa loves it and that what matters isnt it..."
4,Great Read,"This is the second book about Daman Rourke, a detective in 1920's New Orleans. It's a great ""who dunnit"". I was completely surprised at the end. What an ending! The characters are so well developed and the suspense keeps building throughout the book. I wanted to give it 5 stars, but there was one hole in the conclusion, I thought a man like Daman would have seen through, although in all honesty I didn't. Read Mortal Sins first, but don't miss this one."
3,Is this a trilogy?,"A great read but unless this is a trilogy, I do not like the ending of it. Very disappointing."
4,I Hated the Ending,"The story was great, exciting and so very interesting, but I really really hated the ending."
2,Tight squeeze on battery,"The battery would not fit in my charger. Had to sand down the sides of the battery to make it fit. Otherwise, it seems to hold a charge just fine."
5,A Fine Debut,"I think it was Chekhov who said a good rendering of ""nature"" makes the natural world seem like a character a the story, not merely a setting. In this moving first book of poems, Deborah Slicer's natural world is a character of imense depth and complexity. It is never stock or cliche; instead it reveals, line by stunning line, the marvelous range of human emotion."
2,Look carefully,"I didn't, I just read about the ice tip. Turns out this is a cane for the Blind. I didn't catch that."
1,Never Received the book,"I ordered the book as usual and waited the two weeks and never received it. Emailed the vendor to get a tracking number so that i can track and one was not provided, however I was refunded entirely. Just an incovenience."
2,"Kind of thankful, but mostly annoyed","When I ordered this it said, ""Some writing in the margins."" What it did not say was that half of the book would be translated in the margins. Almost every page has writing in it. I am somewhat grateful for that because it helps me out, but its a little annoying when I'm trying to read."
5,Excellent Jazz Album - Love Marcus Mitchell,"No in-depth review, I just know that I like it.The Way She Walks is one of the best Jazz tracks I've listened to.The rest of the album pleases, too."
1,Not even close,"Doesn't even smell like it's suppose to. came in a small sample bottle and on the bottom it said 'gift, not for resale'. Doesn't even smell nice, smells extremely strong and cheap."
4,soothing simple colors and music for very young,"This is not a video for a child older than 3, I cannot imagine it holding their attention. My 2 yr old loved it. It is full of music and bright colors, not fast paced. This video is full of fresh fruit and vegetables, it would be a good to counter media images of cookies and candy- very visually appealing. It is also not a mommy and me cooking video- just something pretty and mellow to watch."
1,Horrible,"The only reason this video gets 1 star from me is because 0 stars is not an option. This was absolutely the worst video my now 14 month old has ever seen and very possibly the cheesiest and stupidest thing I have ever witnessed in my 27 years. A terrible imitation of the very clever Baby Einstein series. Don't waste your money (or more imporantly, TIME) on this product."
1,Yawn!,"I picked up this tape at a friend's garage sale (her 2-year old was bored stiff by it). I'm glad I didn't waste any money on it, because my 2-year old didn't care for it either. The voiceover is smarmy and irritating. Chef Beary Good is just a run of the mill teddy bear, and my daughter found it confusing when it changed outfits. I also think the foods prepared with the fruits and vegetables featured are a bit high-brow for this audience. I mean how many 2-year olds are familiar with Shrimp in Orange Sauce. Maybe orange juice would have been more appropriate. I don't really understand why this has gotten such high ratings and received awards."
5,OUTSTANDING!!!,This book is perfect for girls! I absolutely loved it!!! Judy Blume is the best author for girls of this age!!!
3,timeless story,it is true this book was written in the mid 1970s but it could take place today - 30 years has not changed the under 12 social dynamics or the message put for in the narrative. We are supposed to identify with/ like Jill though she can be harsh and Kenny is meant to be a stabilizing force. He is a likeable character who shows a different side of Linda at the Bar Mitzva.JIll does get a taste of her own medicine when she stands up to Wendy. there character types are recognizeable to most of us at some point in our lives. I liked the book as a teen ager and still like it now as an adult.
2,Judy Blume is not at her best.,"I thought this book was so-so. Even though Judy Blume was not teasing overweight people directly, I feel that if someone who was overweight (or thought they were), read this boook they'd be sligtly offended. I enjoy other books by her, but for even such a quick read, I don't think it's worth reading."
1,Shocked and disappointed,"I am a nine year old girl who tried to read this book, but could only make it to chapter 5 because I was so upset with the story. The characters do awful things to Linda and are not sorry about it. The story is sad and mean, and I am very disappointed in the book. I'm surprised Judy Blume would write this kind of story. There even was a swear word on page 30 that I showed my mom. She was very surprised that Judy Blume would put this in a book meant for 9 to 12 year old kids. I will not be finishing this book. It would be a waste of my time."
3,okay...,"this book was okay. i liked it because it has an unexpected ending, and because it really does portray what school life is like for kids, and bullying, even though this book was written in the '70s.and i didnt like it because?? i didnt like the characters, mostly. its one of the worst things when you dont really like the main, first person character. i really didnt like jill. she was rude, and she did really mean things like she wanted to annoy her brother. my favorite part was the bar mitzvah when linda and her brother kenny stand up to her. I liked Kenny. He was intelligent and dealt with Jill's extremely annoying behavior well."
4,We all grew up with a Linda and a Wendy.,"I liked the meaning behind the writing. I was called names, was one of the last ones picked and waited by the door for recess to be over. This booked showed how cruel kids can be. It did not show apologies or comeuppance because that is rarely done in real life--even if the shoe is on the other foot. When Jill does stand up to Wendy and after a while breaks up other friendships by pointing out that Wendy was a user--I felt Jill didn't learn her lesson. Jill just went on and found someone else to be a lunch partner and class trip friend. I felt sorry for Linda because she ended up being alone again at the end of the book. I always thought the book was left hanging because I always wondered if they would of started teasing Linda where they left off."
1,Poor language choice,"I am disappointed in this book by Blume. My 11-year-old daughter has read several (8) of her books and this is the first one she brought to me - pointing to the word ""bitch"" (not used to describe a female dog) - saying she did not think she should read this book. The word is used by a character that is a student to describe her teacher in the beginning of chapter 4. The book was a nice read up to that point and now I will have to read the rest to see if it is suitable for my daughter to finish. Who has time for that!? Shouldn't we be able to trust an author for our children??? Unfortunately, this has made me question my daughter to read future Blume books."
3,i think that this book stunk,um thets see if you wanna waste your money on a boring book that you can borrow from the library be my guest go and waste your money i dont thnk that it had much of a story line at all and some of the chariters really didnt make sence at all but i think that over all judy blume is a great writer but i think that in this book she really wasted her time in writing this book i dont think that is or could or even should have been writen because it is a hassele to read but it really is not one of the best novels that judy blume wrote in my opion it is the worst thanks
1,Bad book,"This book is not worth reading. It is about some kids who make fun of a girl because she is fat.The main characters are two girls. They make fun of a girl, Linda who their class nicknamed blubber. Then one day the rest of the class likes blubber and they don't like one of the main characters anymore. This happens for no reason at all.This book deserves 0 stars."
3,Not one of Judy's best book,I think this bullying topic is stupid and boring. This is the only book that's bad that's written by Judy Blume
1,JUST AWFUL,"I think in this day and age of school shootings this is a TERRIBLE book. This is how and why kids shoot each other,because they are made fun of.Not to mention the BAD langauge thats in it. I was APPALLED that my 3rd grader brought this book home from the library at school. I have since been to the princpal to have it REMOVED AT ONCE!!!!! Young children should NOT be exposed to such a HORRIBLE story"
5,A realistic look at bullying and peer pressure.,"Kids can be cruel. It's a cliche, but it most certainly has some truth behind it. And no author better portrayed the mentality behind bullying better than Judy Blume did in ""Blubber."" The protaganist of ""Blubber"", Jill, is just an average girl who joins her class in the persecution of an overweight girl, Linda. She goes along with this persecution because she wants to fit in with her classmates and because of the sheer ""fun"" of it. It's real life, and anyone who has experienced Junior High School will recognize this vicious cycle of bullies, follow-the-leaders, and victims.This is not a sitcom. There is no contrived happy ending or clear-cut victory for anyone. Linda is not a particularly likeable character. The ringleader of the bullies, Wendy, never gets her comeuppence. It's real life. Bullies get away with being creeps, and not every victim is a wonderful person. ""Blubber"" is a disturbing, but honest book."
4,A lesson to all people to learn,I liked reading this book. I think everyone should read it. It helps to show why people need dignity and compassion towards other beings.
2,No true resolution,"I found this book incomplete. It's missing a crucial element: its resolution. True, Jill finds out what Wendy is really like, but no one made up with Linda. I went through some of the things Linda had to go through (thankfully not as severe). It really bugs me that people spent the whole book treating Linda so terribly and no one even tried to make up with her. I thought that, at least after what Jill had been through, she'd want to try to make up with Linda. In the end, she should have decided to try sitting with Linda, instead of Rochelle. Or maybe Linda and Rochelle. I think that would have sent a strong and important lesson to children. Without apologizing to Linda, the book has a gaping hole. The kids learned not to follow Wendy, but not how to make things right with those they hurt while following Wendy."
3,"Good, but not my favourite","I've read many books written by Judy Blume but I think this book, which is mostly about bullying, it's not that interesting. I recommend this to those who like Judy Blume's books, though, u might as well felt asleep after reading the first few chapters."
5,''blubber'',I think that blubber is a good for parents and kids of all ages because it is funny and intertanig and will make you want to not stop reading this book.
3,of all the judy blume books read this has to be the most...,Well I think this has to be the most boring book i ever read written by Judy Blume and she is very good writer. And I just found this book very boring.But this might be good to read to a class room because it talks about teasing and the story kind of differnt because the person who makes fun of this one girl is telling the story. But at the end it has a moral meaning because ever one makes fun of the girl (the main chacter) and she kind of learns how it fealt to the girl that she was making fun of. and i could see myself as the main chacter when i was hear age.
2,Quite Disappointing,I am a big fan of Judy Blume.....or so I thought. This story was very disturbing and made me somewhat uncomfortable reading. The plot was pointless and the cruelty expressed by the characters was exaggerated. Quite a disappointment from Ms. Blume.
2,Not among Norton's best,"Dane Thorson and fellow crew members of the trader ship Solar Queen are invited to investigate a mystery. The planet Khatka, a jungle world used as a hunting preserve for rich tourists, is being affected by a powerful sorcerer/magician. He is slowly altering the landscape of the animal world, by using mysterious psychological powers to induce hallucinations and mind control. The adventure is taken up with the the hunt for the sorcerer. Explanations are thin at best, and the story is too short to have much impact, beyond mild entertainment. Skip this one, and opt instead for virtually any other Norton novel."
5,"A beautiful, gorgeous book that invokes prayer","Clare - A Light in the Garden is a book to be cherished, endeared, words to be read over and over. Murray Bodo paints a picture like no other person. He definitely has a sense of the holyness and purpose of St. Clare. Enjoy and share with others!"
5,Clare,"This is a wonderful book. Also, check out the movie ""Brother Sun, Sister Moon"" and the book ""Francis: the Journey and the Dream""."
5,Great pan!,"I'm slowly upgrading my cookware and really need new fry pans. I have a hard-anodized chef pan, and really like the way they perform, so that was a *must* criteria, along with being ovenproof to 400'. I looked at lots, finally settling on this one. I was able to see this 'in person' in the 8"" version - so I knew that this pan is well-balanced, beautifully finished and heavy enough to do the job, but not so heavy as to be hard to handle. It has a very nice ridge along the top side of the handle that adds to the comfort factor. It cooks evenly and cleans like a dream. My best friend, a professional chef, was so impressed that she bought one as well. I do wish it had a cover, but it hasn't been an issue yet."
3,just for beginners,"An interesting book, but good for beginners I mean people who have just finished university and are planning to open a dental cabinet.Dentist and/or orthodontists with some experience will find just some interesting suggestions.Anyway the right score, from my point of view, shoulde be 3,5: 3 for skilled dentist and 4 for beginners.Concluding... congratulation to the Author he did a really good job."
4,Cool Ken,"When I saw this Ken at the toy stores,I never wanted him.But now,I wish I bought him!!!He is sooooo cool!I want to find him somewhere!"
3,Hey K. Paubel!!!,"He have Barbies in CANADA too!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Its not just the US where bad stuff (Drugs, gangs ect!!!) its where i am right now! (in a HOUSE!)THANKS!!!!!Sarah"
1,what will they do with him?,"my aunt got me this for my birthday. this toy is not fun. Sence barbie ""broke up"" with ken who is he gona date. i dont have any theresas or kristys. all i have is barbie dolls. i told my aunt and my mom i already have 73 barbies just barbies. so i wont get any more. Im not wasting my money an a Kristy or theresa. i did 1 for educational. what do you learn from this guy? not to date anyone else besides dumb blondes when you get dumped. i gave it 1 for duribality cuase his head kept falling off and the only way to get it back to normal is to squash it down so he has no neck. if you like unrealistic to much tan and toatly gay waste your money. him sayin dont buy it"
1,Why?,"Mattel has designed and manufactured hundreds of gorgeous Barbie dolls with magnificent clothing and stylish and/or ornate hairdos. Why can't they design a Ken doll that doesn't look like a square peg in a round hole?This Cali Ken doll is a notch up from many other Kens in that his hair is approaching a style, albeit windblown. But look at this stance and the ridiculous look on his face. He looks shell-shocked.I like his outfit. At least it doesn't look like it is falling off of him like most of Ken's suits and shirts do.I would not buy it. I just don't think boy dolls are fun to play with. If I were going to buy a boy doll, it would be a GI Joe."
1,WHAT DID THEY DO TO KEN???,"HE LOOKS LIKE HE LIVES ON THE STREETS! WELL, HIS CLOTHES ARE VERY UGLY AND HIS HAIR IS GREASY AND VERY UGLY...I DO NOT LIKE THIS KEN FOR LITTLE GIRLS.....THANK GOD BARBIE BROKE UP WITH KEN!! BLANE IS A MUCH BETTER LOOKING DOLL AND WAY WAY MORE HANDSOME."
5,you got beef,hi calin this is shaneisha brggs i live in arkansas . i heard about you that what made me go to your web site. i heard that you can sing really great love you . have love for black people you is so great come to my house in visit me i will waiting for you love you from your girl you now you can think about me all night but dontn hurt your self thinking about me i have a friend name takyrra and clinique they are friend but they say are going to give me one more chance i dont need there one more friend clinque wasnt my friend takyrra was my friend takyrra was mad at me she said i now why which i do i am so sorry for what i have done to you and im so sorry for talking behind your back
1,outraged!!!!!!!!,I am totally offended by Mattel's marketing perversion to little girls. Looks like Ken is a Cali Girl. He is dressed with a femine flair. The side of the box has Barbie over sitting with her legs over his shoulder in a skimpy bikini smiling. It pornographic. It is total perversion. I believe it is intentionally marketed this way. Mattel go somewhere else to market your crud! Not the little girls of America
5,The handle makes this truck,"My mother bought this for my son and for the life of me I couldn't figure out why. It was such a simple little fire truck - no bells or whistles. But he absolutely adores it! He got it when he was 13 months old and for the past 7 months has played with it every day. He loves to just carry it from place to place, and fill up and empty the back. Just a great little truck which I'd highly recommend."
3,all Handle Haulers,These are great toys for the young ones. they are durable and easy for them to care around being lightweight and having the handle. I would definitely buy them again.
2,Don't waste your money,"Elliot Engel may be the authority on Poe, but this presentation is laughable to high school students. His mannerisms are so annoying that it was impossible not to shut it off. I would never use this in a classroom. The information is great, but the presentation is not."
2,Mildly Entertaining,"I had been waiting a longtime to read, ""The Sleep-Over Artist"" by Thomas Beller. I had heard great things about it, and I genuinely excited about it. But, sadly, it didn't live up to what I had hoped. I found it melodramatic and down right boring in spots. I never really knew what the author was talking about, and in what time frame we (as the reader) were dealing with. It was confusing and a bit too choppy for my taste. I was disappointed and wished for more."
2,"not bad, but not great either","While at times engaging, this coming-of-age tale ultimately didn't bring anything new to the genre. I was never so bored that I put it down, but nor did I find any of the characters particularly engaging... they seem to float through life, never connecting with anyone, including the reader. There were points where the narrative jumped sideways in a jarring way, especially towards the end, that were too abrupt, unexplained, and made the book unsatisfying. Good material, but needs a good editor!"
2,Empty view into the life and thoughts of an urban guy,"I was excited at the potential of this book, and continued to the end with the hopes that it would get past being a sappy, indulgent glimpse into the unispired and uninspiring activities and thoughts of Beller's ""every guy"". Very empty and very disappointing."
3,"Fun ideas, but too many fan club fillers","I liked that it had lots of room photos and tips for projects. Some turned out a bit odd or too home-made for my taste. Who really wants a dark blue wall with silver 5-inch squares stuck on it? I wish I could sew, then I could make a curtain out of a thrift shop dress. It would save lots of money over shopping at Penny's or Sears.It really does get you to thinking of transforming garage sale finds and throwing around some paint to do a budget makeover for a room.I didn't really need 13 pages listing episode-by-episode what had happened in each weekly show. I wanted decorating ideas, not a fan club book. Just skip past those parts and enjoy the photos and project ideas. Happy decorating!"
3,Inspiring But Too Much Fan Club Stuff,"I liked that it had lots of room photos and tips for projects. Some turned out a bit odd or too home-made for my taste. Who really wants a dark blue wall with silver 5-inch squares stuck on it? I wish I could sew, then I could make a curtain out of a thrift shop dress.

I wanted decorating ideas, not a fan club book. Just skip past those parts and enjoy the photos and project ideas. Happy decorating!"
1,Too Tacky!,"I found this book diffiuclt to use, like it's a commercial for the show. The projects were either difficult or lame; come on, cut up a dress for curtains? Maybe my grandmother would have done that in the 30s, but I'm not about to cut up any of my clothing for curtains when I have K-Mart and Target to turn to. Most of the projects were pretty tacky, and below K-Mart and Target standards."
1,"I did not ask for AOL, I asked for a CD Labeler","This program is another of those that AOL is using to infiltrate and take over your computer. After downloading the software I found that I had also, without knowing it, loaded my computer with AOL software and Icons. What's more, there is no way to uninstall it. They tell you that you can but you can't, unless you know how to go all over your computer and hand pick all the files it adds or modifies. I find this obtrusive and offensive. If I wanted AOL I would have it - after all AOL saturates us with advertising already."
2,Abandoned again,"This product is a good value for the money. however, it is abandoned as a product and won't receive any further updates. Who wants to buy yet another dead end product which will never be repaired? Kind of like buying a car from a manufacturer who doesn't exist any more. Who in their right mind would do that?There are other products out there, like Neato, Magic Mouse Productions' Discus, or even Avery's software, that are still being updated."
4,Labels for CD's,Putting labels on your CD's sounds like a great idea but I found that on some machines putting a label on a CD makes it unplayable. If you don't have that particular problem this program works great for creating attractive and informative labels for your music
2,Label creator which needs improvement,"This program dated 2001 does not support Stomper format. The custom label feature supports simple format only. It seems to have bugs. After created a label, I have to restart the PC for it to work properly. When running the internet with this program in the back ground also caused the computer to hang (some times). This program needs improvement in the area of supporting more label formats and stability."
1,Not so good,"when you install this program it has ways of coaxing you into buying a...annual subscription to a so-called 1,000,000 image club thru their Expressit image link. These images, only a fraction of what you think you are going to get, are mostly junk and mostly cartoon-like images. The program itself is not easy to work with. Front labels, CD labels, and Backlabels are different projects, which makes the whole thing cumbersome."
5,Lovely!!,"These two talented hammer dulcimer musicians have compiled a collection of songs from England, Ireland, and Scotland. It makes great background music!"
2,"Not good for business, OK for basic returns","Tax Cut imported Turbo Tax data very well. Interface was easy to use. Do not get Tax Cut if you plan to depreciate property, you will be disappointed. The program would not create a depreciation schedule which I submitted and only way to override was to manually create and enter depreciation figures for all items and all years. This may be good software for those with basic tax returns however."
5,Long time user,"I've used TaxCut going back to ""Managing Your Money"" days. I've occasionally used competitor Turbo Tax when they gave me free software but have never found benefit of the latter to justify the added cost. TaxCut is relatively intuitive and interfaces well with financial software including Quicken and does a good job of pulling in data from the previous year."
2,Mistaken Identity,"This TaxCut software was ordered because I believed it was the 2009 edition; the year was not shown clearly in the vendor's ad. When I complained, the vendor promptly refunded the purchase price and shipping fee. I then ordered the 2009 edition directly from Amazon. It was sent promptly."
2,Versiones a piano/voz de canciones grabadas anteriormente.,"Aunque tiene sonido y canciones de calidad y buenas interpretaciones del Sr. Cortez, este cd no incluye las versiones grabadas para los sellos disqueros Hispanovox, Pronto, etc.(versiones superiores gracias a arreglos orquestales)."
4,My personal opinion,"I like to listen to this type of music once in awhile. Duringmy military stay in Germany, I developed a taste for this kind of music. It's nice to see that it's still available today..."
2,"Useful for beginners, but not for experienced drummers","This brief book spells out some basic concepts involved in drum tuning that might be helpful for those who have little to no experience tuning drums. However, as an experienced drummer, I found few insights that were helpful. Most of the tips were common knowledge among the drummers I know, and widely available on internet sites."
1,Drum Tuning by Nolly,"In my judgement, this is a very poor attempt on the subject. I suggest that one should beware of this waste of time and money. There has to be better professional advice out there. This is certainly no valuable source in regards to drum tuning. I would leave this one out of your collection!John Lovett"
4,Thinking About Thinking About Thinking,"First, I must confess that when I read the synopsis of Walking The Tightrope Of Reason by Robert Fogelin, I had visions of a much different book. As a science-type who is open-minded, but skeptical, reading a book of straight philosophy tends to make me feel like I've entered the land of navel gazers. The synopsis made Fogelin's book sound much more practical than I found it to be. Still, I found Fogelin's review of the history of philosophy to be a good education in a subject that I've admittedly neglected. If you are looking for a primer on how to navigate the precarious life of a rational animal, Walking The Tightrope Of Reason may fall short and miss the safety net. If you are looking at a nondogmatic and personal review of the history of thinking about thinking, Fogelin's musings could take you across the high wire safely."
5,The best cuban cookbook made easy!,"My mom came from Cuba with this book in tow not knowing how to cook,needless to say she now is making fabulos cuban dishes and she credit this book which is so wornout I'm happy to find it At Amazon.com for her and my entire family.The book makes cooking easy,which she liked since in 1961 she never cooked a thing.Thanks Amazon.com"
1,Not quite as bad as Roxio,"I recently replaced my computer with a 2 gig, Pentium 4 and found out right away that Roxio wouldn't work and their upgrades did not improve performance. I bought NTI CD Maker and found it to be a little better. I have made 2 or 3 copies of discs, but never smoothly. It still stalls, sputters and cripples along. Usually, my computer will lock up and the only way out is to turn it off and back on. Ctrl,Alt,del will not even reset it. If it was worth anything, I would sell it used. I have made many coasters with this software and I think the program disc will ad to my collection. Customer support is nonexistant. Buy it at your own risk!"
3,"CD Writer works great, Jewel case is poor.",I currently use Adaptec 4.0 and changed to NTI 5.0 CD Maker Pro so I could use my system while making a CD. It worked great! I had only 24% system resources and didn't have 1 glitch. The problem is when I went to make a jewel case and couldn't even change the background color of the paper. For $60 I'll find something else that will do it all.
1,Don't waste your time or money,This CD maker is a piece of garbage. It freezes my computer whenever I try to use it. It won't copy correctly and the CD's are of very low quality. Definatley don't waste your time or money on this product; it's not worth it.
5,his best material,"this is the best song that case ever did even better then ""happily ever after"" from his gold certified personal conversation and the foxy brown featured ""touch me tease me"" from his also gold certified self-titled debut album.not only is the track amazing in its own right, its amazing how fast its climbing the charts. it climbed from #37 on billboard's hot 100 singles (from all geners of music) to #5 in one week! it was the greatest gainer in sales/airplay and it deserves it. the remix is even better then the original. cop this single"
4,Sushi!,"Great socks! My sister bought these for me for my birthday. I love them! They are comfortable and are well made. The colors are bright and have stayed that way. I have larger feet for a woman and they fit great. If you really love sushi, you will love these socks!"
5,The cutest little socks out there,"I love these socks, though from the picture I overestimated their size. I thought they would come up a little higher on the leg. But they're still great.The colors are vivid and the pattern is crisp, so you can make out what each little piece of sushi is supposed to be.By far my favorite pair of socks."
1,Poor translation,"Great idea for a book, just poorly planned. When writing a book based on a culture that uses a language with which the author is not familiar, an accurate translation is pretty important. In Arabic, ""Abdi"" literally means, ""my slave."" It is not a name, just a title for one who is literally owned by another. I really can't imagine what Madonna was going for here. The name ""Abdullah"" is common in Arab culture, however has a very different meaning; ""slave of God."" What may have been a simple translation mistake, transforms what would be a fun-filled children's book, into a story of child slavery and servitude. Whoops!"
1,terrible,This is the cheapest thing I have ever bought. Once the small hand hit 6 it couldn't travel up to 7. Cheap cheap. I returned it and lost money on the restocking fee.
2,Not this time,"I had been a big fan of Leslie Meier's other Lucy Stone books.They provided a light, lesurely read for cozy mystery fans.Unfortunately with The Birthday Party Murder, Meier abandonsher attention to the mystery and takes her audience on aheinous ride through her heroine's mind. Throughout the book,the reader is subjected to Lucy's trials and tribulations.Her plights with overeating, weight, husband, cranky boss,pre-teen daughter and lazy college son are so countless,the book starts to feel like a novel adaptation of TheJerry Springer Show. Meier needs to stick to her plot andhow her character's relate to the murder. In the past,Lucy was a warm, humorous character because of herinsecurities and knack for getting into trouble. Here,she comes off more like a complainer who can't stop whining.I really like Leslie Meier writing style and feel she'll writemore good books, The Birthday Party Murder simply isn't oneof them."
4,Better than usual!,"Ms. Meier has returned to writing good cosy mysteries! After the boring and rather flat Wedding Day Murder, this book has been received with open arms. Cute, clever, and keeps you guessing. Miss Tilley is an engaging character, and our wonderful Lucy never fails (with the exception of Wedding Day Murder) to enchant!"
2,"Review of ""Birthday Party Murder""","I've read a few of the Lucy Stone mystery books now and I found this one to be disappointing. Author Meier describes Lucy's busy, hectic life in detail and Lucy's attempts at trying to solve the murder seem half-hearted to me. They take a backseat to all her other activities. In reading this book, I got as tired as Lucy did!The one thing I found to be interesting was the use of the flashback technique to describe 90-year-old Miss Tilley's past life as a young girl.And I also like the book's cover artwork."
1,"It looks cute, but it's DANGEROUS!!","In the first 5 minutes that he played with it, our 14 month old was pushing the truck (using the provided handle), and the truck flipped up backwards right into his face and smashed into the bridge of his nose...a very painful booboo, and now he's black-n-blue. He doesn't want anything to do with it anymore.I tried it myself, and if you don't push down directly in the middle of the handle, it flips up at you every time!!!!"
2,Boring,"there are plenty trucks out there that do something besides being pushed around, it could come with extra pieces, something to put in the back or make noise or do SOMETHING!!!!! but alas it is cute and not too expensive."
1,DANGEROUS TOY,My 14 month old son was playing with this truck. He was trying to push it and crawl and the handle dump truck part popped up which resulted in a huge cut to his lower lip and it BROKE PART OF HIS FRONT RIGHT TOOTH OFF! Do not purchase this toy and please do not give this to anyone as a gift! This should be RECALLED!
1,Not for 12 mon. old....Baby gets hurt everytime he plays!,The wheels are to free for a young child. Everytime they push down on tile or carpet the truck moves to fast and the child falls and ends up with a face full of truck. The first time got a bloody nose and wouldn't play with it for about 2 weeks and the first time follow did the same thing cutting his lip. He has fallen with it 2 more time after that and I took it away!
1,Dangerous Truck,"My son received this truck for his 1st birthday - I thought it would be great because it is nice and big with a large handle. BUT, if the handle is not used, the truck comes flying up. As I've read with other reviews, my son got hit in the face with the truck a few times when he tried to push it across the room using the back end instead of the handle. Thankfully, we didn't have the serious injuries reported by others. We have put it away for now and won't let him play with it."
1,Save Your Money,"This is my second review, I wrote a review a few months back and it was never posted. I had hoped to keep another little one from going through what my son went though. I purchased this for my son's 1st birthday. My son pressed down on the back of the handle sending the front of the truck staight up in the air hitting him in the face, sending his teeth completely through his lower lip. Talk about ruining a birthday!! This is a cute truck with a HUGE design flaw, I can't belive that it hasn't been recalled. Please find another truck for your little angel."
1,horrid,"Within 10 minutes of owning this toy, my 1 year old birthday boy pinched his finger in the up and down dump part of this truck. After he cried and we secured the back end down with string, he did the same thing the other reviewers are saying--- Leaned on the provided handle and flipped the truck smack into this head. That's it! Wewrote a letter to Little Tikes. This toy is dangerous and should be recalled! Whoever heard of a dumptruck that pinches little fingers and flips so easily?? Shame on you Little Tikes. I only wish I would of read these reviews before I let him play with it!"
1,Frustrating for child,"My 2 1/2 year old son got this toy for his first birthday and it hasn't been played with much. He hasn't hurt himself as other reviewers have mentioned, but he does get frustrated with it. He still can't get the dump truck part to open by himself, and now that he's at that ""do it myself"" stage, he gets very upset that it is so difficult to open. So the truck mostly sits in his closet. Very disappointing toy."
1,Not Much Fun,In addition to hitting his head on this toy (as other reviewers wrote) my 15 month old son also gets his hand stuck in between the handle and the dumping end of the truck. He gets very frustrated because he likes to put blocks in the back but he can't get them out without hurting his hand.
5,Awesome,"Yet another great release from Rap Dementia group Sudden Death. If you like comedy music, you'll love this release. I highly recommend it."
5,Excellent Value!,"I got this radio for our crew. The AM is a little weak - - But, where we work, that's expected. The FM and cassette are terrific. I was shocked to be able to tune in to FM stations and get such a clear signal. We now have music, both AC and CD option. Which helps, cause we sometimes have problems with available power plugs in stock area or when we have to pitch-in outside. This unit is light in weight, heavy on RCA expectations. A great product for a nice price."
4,"Great Live Tribute & Define ""Has Been""...","If an onstage reunion of original Blue Oyster Cult members Buck Dharma & the Bouchard Brothers (Joe & Albert) translates to ""has been"" for the previous reviewer, well he/she just don't respect the rock. Now you add members of the Dictators along with Neil Smith & Dennis Dunaway (Alice Cooper) into the ""mix"" and you're left with a raw, romping & inspiring tribute to the late Helen Wheels. If your a fan of BOC, 70's era rock (which is actually being redundant because 70's era rock is rock) or Helen's music, purchasing this album is pretty much a no brainer..."
1,garbage,"don't waste your money on this web cam, spend an extra ten to twenty buck more and get yourself a good camera for the PC. forget buying this peice of junk."
3,Great for a hunting trip.,"I bought this for turkey hunting. The pruning shears are sharp just what is needed for clearing low hanging branches and ground clutter. The choke tube wrench works well very handy to have on a turkey hunt. Why 3 stars? Two reason the main one is that the tools in the handle do not lock into place. This to me is a serious short comming for a tool of any kind. Leatherman boasts that the pawl is the largest they have ever offered not very usefull if it doesn't lock. The knife blade is serreated but does not lock. I don't know what they were thinking. You will have to be very carefull when using the knife or pawl, thus reducing it usefullness to a large degree. The second reason is the somewhat sharp edge of the handle when using the prunning shears. This is not designed to be used all day in a nursery for sure. The rubber gripping ridges on the handle dig in after a short time. But for getting low hanging branches out of theway it will do just fine."
2,Leaked,"It wrote most of the time, but it leaked and some of it leaked onto a white couch which is just about impossible to get out. Thank goodness the carpet was dark - who knows how much got on it. It just plain was a poor quality for such an expensive and high caliber type pen."
5,Christina Aguliera,"Why do u ask that christina Aguliera is the best female pop singer? Well its simple she is pretty, she has a greatvoice and, well she loves her fans. There are many more reasons why I think she is the best female pop singer. Her songs inspire me. I especially liked ""Reflection"" that was the most inspiring song of all. Ther are many other songs that I truely love. ""Im a genie in bottle"", and ""Come on over (All I want is you)"". I give Christina Aguliera 5 stars because she works hard. She makes her fans Happy. I think that Christina Aguliera well make it bigger than she already is. Not only is she talented but shes beautiful. I love you so much Christina. Good luck in life. Peace"
5,Poetry at it's Best!,"Inside this book you will discover a part of history that will entertain you and even create nostalgia about events and places that should always be remembered about Pittsburgh. The stories are easy reading and the book was in excellent condition by the time it arrived at my door.I recommend it for anyone interested in reading about Pittsburgh from the heart of the poet that experienced what he wrote about. Other famous Pittsburgh poets enjoy his works and the style in which he writes just as much as I do, so I highly recommend taking a look."

(2RNR-XM/ A20150).I am sorry for being slow but, which is it?J.R Parson"
5,awesome read,an amazing book for low vision people who's interested in driving or just want to be informed about the aspects of it
1,Drop Dead Dull!,"Granted, I didn't have the killer figured out until it was revealed, (although I did have him at the top of my list) I thought the book was dull. I had to make myself finish it & not just skip to the last chapter to see whodunit. I thought the dialogue was stilted and unbelievable. I also thought it was lacking in transitions. There were huge gaps in the story that left me thinking, ""How did we get here?"" Definitely not a Graham book I'd recommend."
3,Not a usual Graham blockbuster!,"The only reason I kept reading was because it was Heather Graham. I really have enjoyed all of her other books,however this one was lacking in comparison. I think that it was a good story line, but it just never got developed into the usual blockbusters she writes. It was good to pass the time with, but by far not a favorite."
5,Great Romance and Mystery!,"This was my first time reading a Heather Graham book and I really enjoyed this one! This book is a great mystery that keeps you guessing until the very last pages, but also a wonderful, steamy romance book! I liked the idea of two high school sweathearts reuniting after years apart. I think it reminds us all of our first love or the huge crush you had on someone in high school and you always wondered ""what if"". All in all, this was a really fun read, the kind of book you pass along to all your friends. I look forward to spending many more late nights reading Heather Graham!"
1,Not on par with most of Graham's books,"I have read many of Heather Graham's historical novels, and several of her more recent contemporary novels, so I picked this one up. Between the unbelievable situations and dialogue and the annoying and selfish characters, I found myself kind of hoping that the killer-the identity of whom I figured out well before the end-would knock off even more of them. There were some random elements thrown in that were, I guess, supposed to be titillating, but I just found them to be distasteful and irritating. Thank goodness that Graham's writing has evolved since this book."
1,Banal,"Good Agatha Christie style plot, but the characters were flat, vacuous and interchangeable. Totally lacking in believability."
5,"A nice story about classmates, a past and murder in Miami",Lori had come back to Miami and finds herself in her old feelings for Sean Black. A killer is on the lose and they don't know is close to them; he is one of his classmates.This story who's plot ins in Miami is a most read!!!!!!
1,crash anc burn!,Bought it for my son as a present and right out of the package on its maiden voyage it crashed and one of the props broke off. It was a waste of money!
3,Fun to fly,"I bought the Intruder from a ToysRus store in Norway.It comes ready to fly out of the box. Easy instructions and etc.It is great fun, but although I followed all the charging instructions, the plane will not fly for more than about 30 to 45 sec. Actually this feels like a long time in the beginning, but not after you have masters the controls. The RC also seems a little unrespoding.I also have been flying a SKY-A40, witch cost the same. This plane is more responsive, and alas, is more easy to crasch. The main difference is in the charging. After 2 minutes the A-40 will fly for about 5 minutes, and the Intruder for 45 sec.Nevertheless I recommend this plane to a kid and a dad (or mom)for some fun in the park.PCLNorway"
3,Pretty Good Plane,We were able to get the plane up in the air after a few tries. The controls are fairly good and my 8 year old nephew has enjoyed the toy. It does start to break apart after 10-15 flights so be sure to give the your little one the heads up that this plane might just be for a few flights.
2,Broken,"I bought this toy and it broke I think on its 5th flight about, well it stopped working anyway it would run for about 5 seconds then stop i dunno if dis is cos we changed it to not need batteries and run a different way.My dad say he rang them and they never rang back, he does not lie really unless hes joking and after $50 i think he would ring them"
2,bad bad bad,"This is the worst r/c plane showed ...Never try to buy it!!It's a preview of this toy.They called it ""plane""-its partly impossible to take off.You will need to throw it against the air.-if you do a small error on taking off the plane will crash on land.-when you take off the plane it will be on air for just 30 seconds in maximum.I'm not kidding with you!!!-It takes more than 5 minutes to play 30 seconds"
3,great,"This was a great toy no problems at all. To the lady who bought two and had difficulty, if your sons were flying theirs at the same time the planes were probably running on the same frequency and causing problems with the controls when the radio of one plane would interfere with the other plane."
3,Air Hog Intruder,"I got the plane for my stepson. It is a excellent plane for beginners because the controls are simple which makes it easy to fly by my 8 year old stepson. It is also very durable. We have ran the plane into houses, trees, and brick walls and nothing has broken it yet. You can't fly it if it is windy. Keep the controller on the beginner setting until you fly it allot because the controlls respond pretty quick when you put it on the advanced setting which makes it crash pretty easily. The other major downfall is that I can only get about 30-90 seconds of fly time out of a charge. Because of that my stepson was not to happy. I hope this helps anyone who is thinking of buying this product."
1,"Great toy concept, but it does not work!",I read other online reviews prior to buying. I saw mostly positive responses and only a few negative reviews. Unfortunately I must add a negative review.This toy is a great idea. I bought one and it only held the charge for 30 seconds. I exchanged it for another and it only held the charge for 1 minute. Not worth the money. I will now return the second one. Once they can improve the battery situation I would consider buying one.
1,Total POS,"I would give it 0 stars if I could and yes I watched the video. It takes off, loops and then nose dives into the ground...every time. It's completely uncontrolable. I tried two different planes, neither worked. My neighbor bought one for his son and they couldn't get it to work. I gave one to my brother, he tried and couldn't fly. I then sent the one I had to a cousin that works for the FAA, is a licensed piolt and has been flying RC planes for years...and yes he couldn't make it fly. Don't even bother, biggest waste of time, money and effort in my life."
1,Purchased 2 for my sons,"I purchased two for my sons. The one would turn left as soon as you put in into the air and would turn until it rammed itself into the ground. The other crashed fairly gentlely into the lawn and broke the prop off. I glued the prop and cover back on and it flew two times before it started turn right only. BEWARE do not purchase these items. I purchased 2- Radio Controled Air Surfers and they work great, these Air Surfers are an absolute riot. I cannot beleive that people are actually allowed to sell things, like the air hogs, that do not even work for a little while. It should be against the law, I paid over a hundred dollars for two air hogs with shipping and my boys and I used them for 25 minute and the plane were done. End of story."
2,itruder plane review,i think the spinmaster itruder planes is a waste the one I bought doesn't even fly when you turn it on and breaks very easily but it just might the one i got it is very nice looking thought.gloucesterg
2,Better in theory than in practice,"I loved the idea of this toy when I saw it at Toys R Us and bought two of them. The first one flew great. We launched it and it went up, up, up, over the trees at the end of the field and kept on going. It may still be going for all I know; I never saw it again.The second plane we were able to get airborne but it too was very difficult control with any precision. It would stay up for a minute or so and crash hard. It survived the first few crashes and then broke apart.All in all this was not money well spent."
1,DON'T BUY - NO NO NO,"POS - I haven't seen a toy manufactured this badly in a long time!!! I never had control of them. They crashed within 10 seconds every time. I know it wasn't defective, because I bought one of each color for my sons (who are now extremely dissapointed!!!) CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP - DON'T DO IT"
3,No replacement parts available,"No replacement parts available for the Intruder. We broke a prop and glued it . It held but the next time out the other prop on the same engine broke. We called and they said that no parts are available but we could replace the complete plane for [$$]. Needless to say, we are not happy about this."
1,Utterly Useless and Frustrating,"I recently purchased one of these planes for my son. Firstly the cost of the plane nearly doubled when we included the cost of the batteries. Secondly the plane is supposed to fly on ""auto pilot"" for the first five seconds to prevent ""pilot error"". During these five seconds the plane consistently banked to the right (the same behaviour mentioned by the first reviewer) and crashed into the ground. A huge waste of money."
5,GREAT FUN,"This is my first plane but don't worry it is really easy to learn to fly, and requires only a short time (3 minutes) to re-charge. All in all a great plane. My dad bought it for me and I play with it all the time. IT'S GRRREAAAT....."
1,Decieving reviews(older than 13 I am 20),"I bought into the hype that this was a great plane and maybe i got a rotten plane. But buyer beware. I have had no luck with this plane. I Took it out one day just for the heck and charged it up and it quickly dove into the ground. The next day i took it out and the batteries must have been used up. For charging a plane once and keeping indoors without the plane on it so there was nothing to drain the batteries it died. And as for charging. It does take forever!. 3 minutes isn't that long but when compared to people saying the max possible flight time to be 3 minutes. think about it. That's not that much. One kid wrote his would only fly for 30 seconds.I would and most likely will go to a local hobby store and buy a real ""beginner"" plane that runs on actual rechargable batteries. A complete package for this is [amt]. DOn't waste your money on one of these planes it's not worth it."
2,This is fun?,"I had high expectations for this plane- its looks great and fun. But when I got it, it was horrible. It hardly ever flew, the SLIGHTEST breeze took it out, and there is NO, altitude control. The faster you go, the higher you go. No inbetween, no ability to slow down (go lower) (unless you press land, in which case the plane starts spiraling down in huge circles. Another down side it that when you do ""land"", the engines continue to go, wasting charge, and the plane is VERY fragile. The paint job is gone after a few ""flights"", and BY THE WAY, THE ENTIRE PLANE IS MADE OF STYRAFOAM. Yea, thats right... that white light weight, highly fragile stuff. It was a huge dissappointment, I don't reccomend it to anyone, I was in a very big feild the times I ""flew"" it, buyt it always managed to stray into the trees, or the parking lot, or some other ""bad"" place. Its not worth the money- Don't buy it. BELIEVE ME- and PASS this one up."
1,"DON""T BUY THIS TOY!!!","My son requested this as a Christmas gift, and I purchased it. Upon the first flight the plane crashed into a bush and the wing broke off. It's appauling that with the availability of light weight plastics capable of surviving the impacts this plane is subject to, that the manufacturer choose to use styrofoam."
5,Broken Propellar,This item is alot of fun but the propellers are on the outside of the wings and when it lands it leans to one side and the propeller hits ground and breaks. They said since it was the first time flying it they would send another plane since you cannot buy just the propeller. But what about next time? I think they should make the propellers available seperatelly (10 pack)or a modification so the propeller won't hit the ground.
1,Do (air) hogs fly?,"I have bought one of these for my 10 year old & we were never able to get it airborne. Fortunately it is pretty sturdy as it crashed all the times. My basic question is: if this plane is so easy to fly & is tailored for young kids, how come even I (47yrs old) could not make it fly? My advice to you is to look elsewhere."
5,TOO COOL!,"I got this thing stuck in a tree, flown into a pole, about 100 nose-dives, and this airplane has only a tad of paint scratched off! This plane flies like a charm! I recommend this plane to E-V-E-R-Y-B-O-D-Y!!!"
1,Another RC Joke,"I got this plane and I thought it would be fun to fly on the weekends. I charged it up and watched the included video, etc. I threw it into the air and it crashed and the wings broke right off (both!) Maybe I just had a defective one but it didnt look too good after it crashed. I gave it 2 educational stars because it does explain some information on flights. I dont recommend this"
2,Crash Prone,"This might have been a good toy, if it didn't have a strange tendency to crash. They give you this B.S. on how it has this stupid ""once you fly out of range the plane will automatically land"" they really meant crash."
2,Don't get it,"This plane could take anything, but it only flew for 20 seconds strait until it crashed and requiered repairs again. I flew it for an astounding 80 seconds straight but then the engine cut out and it glided into my neighbor's pool. After getting wet, I suspect that the plane is broken because whenever I charge it now the propeller starts and cuts your fingers. If you want a plane that could durvive a nuclear strike but has no fun while flying it than you've found a calling. Other than that,DONT GET IT."
1,Nutrition Information Missing!,"The recipes contained here lack important nutritional information: carbohydrates, sugars, protein, diet exchanges. This is ironic, since the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation's cause is outlined in the opening pages. The editors missed the boat by focusing only on fats, cholesterol & sodium.It is obvious a great deal of effort went into the making of this book, and I would like to see an updated edition published in the near future."
4,"Low Action, Fast Neck. Easy to pack in a roller case.","I think mine was a end of the day job. There are marks on the finish and I have had problems with the solder connections on the pickup. Having said that, this is the easiest guitar to play, the action is low and there is no fret buzz.The trick to staying in tune is to pull the strings and then tune from flat to in tune. Good practice with any guitar, essential with this one. Re-stringing is not easy.I sheared the brass bolt that holds on the arm rest. Customer service was very helpful and purchasing a replacement was easy.Travels with me everywhere. I love playing it."
2,Needs Some Work,"This particular mold is very tipsy. I've been collecting these models for quite some time now and certain molds I've learned to stear clear of, the base for Nothern Lights is one of them. However, I liked his finish so much I picked one up for myself and, of course, once out of his package he could hardly stand on his own.If you get yourself one of these guys, be aware it may very well have balance issues. A bit of sticky wax on the feet will keep it on a shelf but it's not the best horsie if you want it for a child to play with as it may take a few more spills than usual and break."
5,Great toy at a GREAT price!!!!!,This barbie is the BEST!!!! Her clothes are so cute! Dhe is so durable too. my dog tried to chew up the doll but it didnt even break! Its a great doll
1,VeRY UGLY DOLL!!,"The outfit is nice, but her face is disgusting!! Absolutely scary looking. Mattel could of did better than this. The Christie Version is very pretty and Teresa. Blaine looks better than this one! Her eyes are big and spaced out like she is on drugs, overload of very LIGHT pink lipstick with a VERY dark tan does not work well, and the ugliest hair i have seen i think on a barbie doll? It's like three shades and nasty looking. DO NOT BUY this doll for 5 dollars or more. $2.50 is good so that way you can maybe do a repaint on her and get her outfit. THumbs down on this one mattel."
1,UGLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Could a Barbie be any uglier!! If Mattel is this desperate, I DEFINETLY am not buying any more products from them. If your looking for a nice doll, buy another Barbie or spend your money on a doll from another company."
1,"poor, poor; you are not even able to listen to samples ---",How in the world do you rate a CD when you are unable to listen to samples of it.I want to be able to hear a sample before I buy it!!
2,Poor Manufacturing,"Oh, it makes me sad to write this. When this keyboard is working, I love it. I have neck arthritis and other posture issues, so the design is absolutely perfect. However, they seem to have manufacturing bugs they haven't been able to work out for years. I have had 3 and every one has failed within 18 months. I keep the keyboard on my lap when in use, putting it back on my desk when not. Every single one has failed where the wire enters the keyboard, making the keys (not the touchpad, though!) inoperable. Further, when I ordered a replacement, one I received had about 10 keys that didn't work at all. While they did replace that, it was a pain. I wish they would work out the kinks in manufacturing because the design is ideal."
2,The rack that looks like it was made by third graders,"Based upon reviews of other racks by this manufaturer, I ordered this. It arrived quickly. Upon closer examination the cut off of the main suport is at an angle and does not match the other side. The pegs are not perpendicular to the base as one would expect, and the overall quality is not what I expected. I will use it as I don't want to go through the trouble of returning it and getting another that may even look worse.I do not recommend purchase of this item."
3,Purse Happy Place,"I was slightly disappointed with this item because the make of the item is shotty. It was uneven which made it difficult to put in the screws and the paint job was not smooth. This is the second one I bought because I needed to hang my purse collection, but would probably go with a metal rack next time. The only positive comment was the price was right and it was a speedy shipment to my job."
3,"Nice, but nothing remarkable","This album was recorded in Bremen, Germany and features some well-known German studio musicians. Overall, this is a palatable and accessible jazz-pop album, but it is a bit too lightweighted. Only the rocky ""Beton"" provides some sparks and looks back to this band's great late '70s output. Nevertheless, the first half of this album is perfect for chilling out or drinking tea with grandma. Unfortunately, the second half is filled with unnecessary drum performances (minus 1 star). This was Pierre's last effort under the Gong name, as in 1989 the original Gong line-up with founder Daevid Allen reunited, playing for some concerts in Britain."
5,All the gory details of the political side of the revolution,"This book is about politics - not war. Revolutionary battles are covered in 1 paragraph. But then it goes on in fascanating detail as to the political ramifications of the battle.And it's not just the war. The book starts about 10 years before the declaration and goes up to Jefferson't inaguration. So you get the political sweep from when the colonists first started thinking of independence up to the point where the republic had a good chance of continuing to exist.What is amazing how at so many points, the U.S. almost did not come in to being. And how at later points it slmost fell apart. And this book lays it all out in detail.If you are interested in the real story of the creation of the United States, this is the book to read."
4,Great Political History,"John Ferling's history of the early United States is an excellent example of creating a history not just of the rich white man but of the lower class folks as well. Ferling has excellent notes that can be consulted for further reading on almost any subject regarding the early U.S.Ferling does an excellent job conveying the sense of uncertainty of defying the British Empire, creating a new nation and creating a completely new model of government. The author does a great job placing political meaning behind events such as the Stamp Act and the Boston Tea Party.Finally, Ferling does a good job on his short biographies of the major characters of the American Revolution. He does a particular excellent job on Samuel Adams. Overall a great book to read to grasp the political side of an event that changed the world."
4,An Excellent Narrative Account of the Path to Indepenence,John Ferling is a gifted writer and skilled at extracting details that illuminate the founding fathers and the dramatic events of the Colonial era. He does an effective job of summarizing the philosophical ideas of the American founding and the bitter contest between the revolutionaries on one hand and the British soldiers and their loyalist allies on the other. Ferling concludes his book with the struggle to chart America's course between the Federalists and their opponents.
2,worked good until......,"this program worked great until i simply wanted to turn it off for bit. when i turned it back on it was letting everything through. checked all the settings no luck. when i un installed it, the program managed to delete all my ports (common with braodband users). which made accessing the internet impossible. since it was the download i had no other choice but to format my hard drive. it turns out i was not alone, several people have ran into the same problem including some reviewers of this product. so i hope this helps to answer some of your questions. if you have dsl or dial up this does not seem to happen."
5,Must have for Cable/DSL connections,"ZoneAlarm works by blocking unwanted intrusions into your system. After being on some download sites, I've had over 500 hits in less than and hour! Granted, most of these are from the server trying to see whether the computer is still active, but it's good to know you have some measure of security. A truly determined hacker can get through it (and most any other firewall for that matter), but in most cases ZoneAlarm is a more than adequate first step for Internet security...In all, ZoneAlarm is worth the money..."
2,beware-the installer overwrites your font files,"I don't think the user interface is very good on this product, but one thing really irked me. When you install the product it overwrites your Windows system font files without asking you. And this is verison 3 of the product! We use Garamond in our label and the True Type Font it overwrote was much better. We had to recover the original font from another system. This happened on both Windows98 and Windows XP Professional. Unfortunately, I verified this was the culprit for sure the second time around. Hopefully, this will save you some grief."
5,Perfect CD Labeler,This CD labeler is the highest in quality and I have found it very easy to use with almost no complications. I recommend this to anyone who has either just bought a new CD Burner or has blank CD's to use. It works great and writes clearly. This is great for everyone since it is so easy to use and easy to read...even if you are not a computer guru.
2,not bad,"This software is ok for designing labels. Personally, NEATO's MediaFACE 4 is much more powerful. The Design Wizard is awesome. With NEATO's software (www neato com), I was able to create a label for my audio cds without typing in the song names. It automatically recognized the songs (needs to be able to connect to internet)."
2,not much interaction,"My son got two of these for his 1st birthday, and we exchanged one for another toy. Now, I wish that we would have exchanged both of them. The handle blocks the truck bed from loading anything in and and there is not much room to haul anything anyway. My son got bored very quickly and just pushes it out of the way to get to other toys."
1,Not for young toddlers,"I bought this toy for my 17 month old son, and when he pushes it, the truck flips up and gave him a bloody lip. This happened twice. He had a playdate with a 14 month old boy and the same thing happened to him, but worse."
4,"FYI, NO BONUS ISSUES","Just an FYI, this collection does NOT include the rare one-shot ""punisher kills the marvel universe"", as some reviewers have stated. Maybe an earlier edition did, but the one I just received does not. Unfortunately that bonus comic was the main reason I bought this, but I can't fault the collection. It's still a great punisher maxi-series."
4,Great tape,"I did not know these were still available till I ran a search on amazon, I extreme please to add these to my collection."
5,Great relaxation music,I heard this artist on a shoutcast and knew I had to have it. It is very romantic and relaxing.
4,Very good,Really good Historical account of this Sickness. But I wasn't so bogged down in the history that the story wasn't held back by it. The author did a good job of combining the two. A little slow in parts but the love story was so sweet!
2,"A good attempt, but falls short","This book was a nice, basic historic novel that read like the plot was outlined by a 5th grader. Every twist and turn was very predictable, and overall, it felt like it should have been a short story, but the author was compelled to add more words, to fulfill some publisher's quota. Palls in comparison to speak. It's hard to believe they were written by the same person."
3,good history lesson,"What I liked about this book is that it brought me to a time period where society was given many tests. What do people do when they are in challenging situations of life and death? We are lucky today, with our knowledge of medicines, etc.What I didn't like about the book is that Mattie's voice was not strong enough. Ms. Anderson's character in Speak was extremely convincing and I had high expectations for Mattie as well. All the characters were leading towards being pretty sterotypical.And there were a few times Ms. Anderson would describe something and then she would stop. I was waiting for more detail, so I could smell, hear, taste the situation, but I was disappointed in some places.All in all Fever 1793 was a solid book, that teaches some good lessons."
5,Awesome book!,"This has been my favorite book since I first read it in fourth grade. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone I could, I think everyone should read it"
5,excellent,I purchased this book for my son. Its one of the books he has to read over the summer when entering into 7th grade. He is enjoying the book. We borrowed it from the library while this was on the way.
5,Great Read!!,When I first read this book I was in fifth grade and couldnt put it down! I reread it all the time. Not only is it factual it is very interesting. I enjoyed this book so much that when I first read it I went out and bought the book. I suggest the book to everyone. It is an amazing book!! :)
4,Fever 1793 by Laurie Halse Anderson,"This is a great historical young adult novel. I never really knew much about the fever of 1793, and this story told of what people may have gone through, with some true facts about the fever at the end of the book. The cover is beautiful and eerie and draws you in right off the bat. Mattie is a courageous main character who goes through great strides to survive the fever and reach out to others who need help. She endures alot of heartache from people close to her dying, but never gives up. Overall, it is a great book that can be enjoyed by both teens and adults."
4,A book of sad,"Fever 1793 is a very touching book. It is about the fever in Philadelphia during 1793. People dying everywhere, in the streets. The main character suffers while she goes to safety. Will she her family be together or will they be torn apart and never come back again?"
3,Fever by Laurie Halse,"Fever by Laurie Halse is about yellow fever. Matirlda's mother owns a coffeehouse. It takes place in Philadelphia. Matirlda is 14 years old. Her mother goes missing. The coffeehouse gets robbed. Some house is infested with people that have yellow fever, and to show that they have yellow fever there is a yellow rag tired around the doorknob. The people that died from yellow fever were thrown into a gaping hole. The robbers strangled her grandfather.The book had exciting parts, sad parts, and weird parts. This book was not what I thought it would be. Some parts made me sad, when I thought about that the book is true. It did not end like I thought it would.By Liz"
3,fever1793,"This book is about a fever that comes to a town. A girl named Matilda and here family lives there.Matilda has a mom and a grandfather. Matilda also has a helper named Eliza. Matilda's grandfather caught the fever. They have to take her grandfather to a town that has a hospital. When they get there, grandfather spreads the fever around the townNow the people of the town are dying. That night two robbers come aand try to stell there stuff. Grandfather hears the robbers and gets his gun. Grandfather goes down the stairs. Grandfather aims but is to weak to pull the triger.So the two robbers kill grandfather.I would not recommend this book to people under 14 because this book is boring.I give this book three stars."
5,fever 1793,"this book(fever1793) is a really good book and it is about way back in 1793 when a lot of people get invated with disease called fever where they get so sick they lose there eye color(there eye turn yellow)and about 1,000 people are dieing of this disease and that is a real good book and i hope you will give it a chance because it is worth reading(TRUST ME IT IS!)"
4,Not as good as Speak,"I enjoyed this book, chosing it because of my love for Anderson's popular novel, Speak. Speak will always be my favorite, but Fever 1793 was enjoyable, compassionate, factual and interestingly historical. Just a note, the reviewer ""Katie"" on April 29, 2003 may have read the book wrong or perhaps had a different edition than me bacause her facts were wrong. Mattie did not have a brother, in fact she was an only child. And her grandfather died because it was his time, of causes unrealted to the fever and dod not die fighting off the burglars."
5,Fever of 1793,Fever of 1793 was an excellent choice for our mother/daughter book club. Our book club has been together for 4 years and it was one of our favorites. Mattie is a strong female role model who faces despair but reaches to the depths of her soul for strength to conquer all odds. She has a relationship with her mother that goes through a lot of growth. Epidemics such as the fever of 1793 can be equated to our own current epidemics and a study of how people choose to respond to adversity. Highly recommended. Very thought provoking and discussion worthy.
4,An Educational Adventure,"This touching story provides the reader with an acurate view of Yellow Fever enveloped Philadelphia from the point of a spunky 13 year old girl. Mattie, the book's main character struggles with the weakening and losing of her small family, the horrors of a emedemic stuck city, and her personal emotions. I highly recomend this book as a historical fictiong gem."
4,My Review,"This book Fever 1793 was an o.k. book. I would deffinitley recommend it to a friend. The main character, Matilda Cook is a hard working little girl. Her mother is very strict about most things. Matilda, her mother, and her grandfather run a small coffee house in Philedalphia, Matilda's mother owns it.As they go on with their lives they find out that a sickness called the ""Fever"" is going through the town, killing many people. Matilda's mother catches it and is taken away to a sick home while she is gone Matilda catches the fever and goes to a hospital with her grandfather. She searches for her mother, wondering if she's still alive. Finally her mother comes home.I would probably would give this book a 4 out of 5. The part I liked was when Matilda's mother came home. A part that I didn't like was when Matilda's grandfather died."
5,A must read for historical fiction fans.,"""Fever 1793"" is a great book and a great way to learn how yellow fever can destroy lives. Having never read about the yellow fever epidemic in 1793, this novel gave plenty of detail of how the young city of Philadelphia was affected by the disease, how doctors treated patients, and how quickly family and friends turned on each other. The Appendix was very neat because it gave a brief history lesson of events and people mentioned throughout the book. I recommend."
4,A preteens prospective,"I thought this book was very good because it showed me alot of history on how things used to be. It showed different rospectives of doctors, farmers, african americans and several other things in this time period. I very highly recomend this book.It just pulleda me into it. I read the whole thing in 2 days!"
4,Fever 1793,"Mattie Cook, a 14-year-old girl, lives with her mother and grandfather in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Her family owns a little coffee shop, so Mattie spends most of her days doing chores. During the summer of 1793, yellow fever wonders the streets of the city taking 10% of the city's population by the end of the epidemic. Eventually Mattie's Mother ,Lucille, catches the fever, and sends Mattie and her grandfather to the country to live with the Ludingtons. Then, something terribly goes wrong, and then things just keep getting worse.Once you start the book, you just can't put it down. Laurie Halse Anderson did a great job with all the researching."
5,YELLOW FEVER,THIS IS AN EXCELLENT BOOK AND IT IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF DONT JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER IT IS ABOUT A GIRL WHO IS TRYING TO STAY AWAY FROM THE YELLOW FEVER SO SHE CAN LIVE I THINK THIS BOOK IS A MUST READ BECAUSE IT IS AN EXCELLENT STORY SO GO AND READ FEVER 1793!
2,Fever 1793,"I give this book 2 out of 5 stars because it was dull with very few exciting parts in it. I like how the author made it seemed like the characters were real. What I dislike about the book was, it was boring and dull and nothing happened for long periods of time but the last 2 or 3 chapters were good. It did not make up for the rest of the book. Overall I would not recommend this book to anyone unless you like dull and boring book."
2,REVIEW OF FEVER 1793 (...),Well my review for fever 1793 is about a teenage old girl. She lives in philidelphia and is plaqued by a sickness called yellow fever. Her grandpa dies of it. She lives in a coffe house and helps her mom with the businnes. Her mom and the cook out of fear run away and leaves her alone with her grandpa.The book is a good story but I dont partiuallary like it. I dont like it because im not interested with history or books with only people. Its just not interesting.i think people who like and are interested in history should read this book for a.r. points
4,Worthwhile piece of YA historical fiction -,"This was a good, quick read with nice suspense and a fair amount of historical references. Living around Philadelphia, this book held a special place for me because I recognized many of the places that were discussed in this book as places I've visited many times. Ms. Anderson did a good job of sharing the horror of the yellow fever epidemic, while at the same time telling a story of an incredibly courageous young woman."
3,Excellenta!...um..maybe,"This book was a pretty good book.. Even thought at some times i couldn't follow along as well at some points, it was a very intresting bok. I like books that are set back in time because of how much detail these writers pur into it. I thought that alot of kids could relate to it but then a lot of kids couldn't. My point is that this wasn't really my type of book. But it could be yours!"

5,Good historical fiction book for jr. high,"I read this book because the students at my school were studying it for their literature class. It is a simple read, not unlike the Little House on the Prarie series level of reading. It tells of a young girl's struggle through the plague and how her life is changed and how she changes others. Challenges, independence and survival."
5,"Fever 1793 will rock your world, crazylizzyliz","Fever 1793, by Laurie Halse Anderson, is by far my favorite book, it is so good I read it all in one night and usally I'm a slow reader. It just amazed me so much I couldn't put it down. It's a book that is writin so well it puts an image in your head about what everything looks like in the book. But thats not all it does. This book has alot of feelings throughout it's pages, it has sad times, happy times, hard times and so many more. Some parts of the book I felt like I would cry, but during other parts of the book I wanted to laugh or say awww! If you want to read a book about fear, saddness, braver, strength, love, and success, then this is a book I really think you should read! So don't forget that great fun you'll have when you read Fever 1793. Thanks for reading my review and I hope you'll enjoy the book as much as I did and still very much do. Fever 1793 Luver, (...)"
5,FEVER 1793 (...),Fever 1793 is a want to read book. It is about a young girl named Mattie Cook who has to fight to survive when yellow fever breaks out in the summer of 1793. This story also takes place in Philadelphia.To find out more look up Laurie Halse Anderson or Fever 1793. You will love this book I know I did.This book is good because it was what really happened in 1793. I liked this book so you might too.
3,An oky book!!,Fever 1793 is an oky book it talks about different things and it is a good book.If you like deep books read Fever 1793.
5,"This book was so well written, I did not want to stop reading!","Young, gifted students could read this book. The only mature topic covered is death (no sexual stuff). The target audience is high school age, but I am in my 30's, and I loved reading the book. I cried along with the main character and hoped she would find her mother alive. I originally read the book to screen it for my daughter who is a gifted student, but very young. I enjoyed the book a lot more than I thought I would.I liked how at the end the author lists what she made up and what is real, so kids can understand the real event."
3,Jalen P's Fever review,"This is my online review about Fever 1793. It has its ups and downs meaning it has good and bad chapters.The way i would summerize this book without giving anything away is like this: mattie cook, her mother ,her grandfather, and Eliza gothrough some rough times throughout the book.The bite of a certain creature will cause certain conditions."
5,Fever,This book is quite good although it could use work in character devolopement. It is very inspiring.
1,Fever 1793,I thought Fever 1793 was not a very good book. It is hard to follow and it is also boring. You would really only be able to under stand it if you were to research about yellow fever. If you ever come across this book I should warn you do not buy it unless you like history class.
3,A Little Too Melodramatic,"The bubonic plague in Europe took 25 million lives. The Yellow Fever in 18th century Philadelphia took a mere 5000 lives and lasted a few weeks. Anderson overdramatizes the event both in the historical context as well as the storyline. So much happens to her heroine over such a short period of time that it strains credulity.Also, a note to the author. On Page 187 of the paperback, 'laying' should be 'lying' according to the rules of correct grammar."
1,bAD!!!,ok so this is a terrible book. i think it makes no sence an it was badly written. im not an english expert but c'mon
1,snorezilla,"The book Ferver 1793 was a historical fiction book. That is why I think that it was so dull.Some kids get on here and write o this book was so good I loved it. Even when they hated it. It killed me to finish this book.I had to read it for school and let me tell you ,I never knew school could be so much torture.Polly dies then everyone else dies.Let me know when the movie comes out. This book was so dumb it almost made me wanna scream. Snorezilla strikes again is what the real title should be.I give it 2 thumbs down+8 fingers.Bo"
4,"Fever, 1793","Mattie was only a girl, and her whole city was getting sick with the yellow fever. A few thousand already dead, Mattie has to support herself and run the family coffeehouse. This is ""Fever, 1793"" by Laurie Halse Anderson. The genre is based on a true event in history. The story is about the yellow fever plague that swept through Philadelphia in the summer of 1793. Mattie's grandfather was a captain in the army under George Washington and Mattie's mother ran a well-known coffeehouse in Philadelphia. Mattie, in the beginning of the story, was very lazy and hated work. However, a few months later, she was running the coffeehouse with her mother still missing from the fever and her grandfather was dead. I think this book would be good for anyone, because it is our history and the story is exciting when things start to happen."

3,fascinating yet distant,"This is a fascinating account of a devastating fever epidemic in Philadelphia, then the capital of the United States, in 1793. Nearly overnight-- people contract the disease and die within the hour-- Mattie's life goes from being a slightly overworked teenage daughter of a proprietor of a successful coffee house, to a young woman struggling to survive in a city that's taken on the bleakness of a Mad Max film.Yet somehow we never come as close to Mattie as we might, or as we do with the main character in Anderson's SPEAK. Mattie's thoughts are so much on survival and on food that at times the book feels a bit like a travelogue of a disaster. Salvation, when it comes, also seems abrupt. In the end, this is a quick way to get an immediate feel for a terrible time in history, but although we are told a lot about Mattie, her family, her hopes and dreams, somehow she stays elusive. Emotionally, the book is a little disappointing, but it's still well worth a read."
4,Fever 1793,"Fever 1793byLaurie Halse AndersonThe book Fever 1793 is a good book. It is about a very deadly that is going around Philadelphia. The charecters call the fever, ""Yellow Fever"". It is said to come every late summer around August.The main charectar's family owns a cofeehousemain charectar's name is, ""Mattie"".Mattie is the hardest working emploie in their family cofeehouse get a lot of business because George Washington's house was built two blocks away.Yellow Fever is a bad illness. The fever has been mostly caught by the river. It has been scaring people away from the shops near the river. The people being scared causes the cofeehouse to get more business.Polly was the 1st one to die from the disease. A lot of people died because of the Yellow Fever. Even Mattie's mother died. This illness caused a lot to move away too.I hope you choose to read this book and enjoy it as much as I did. I give this book a 4 star rateing.To find out the end, read this book. The ending is great."
5,Captivating and Thrilling Tale,This was an amazing book that I couldn't put down. It was such an unusal and well told story. I loved all the character and felt as if they were real from the authors story telling abilities. Please read this book. Not only do you get a good read out of it but some facts too.
3,It was ok,I read this book for an English class and I was entertained nut would not have read this book on my own
2,Reflection on Fever 1793,"Interesting, historical novel. Demonstrates a very brave, heroic girl through many hardships and loses. Very inspiring to many. Not a bad read."
5,Great book for all ages,"Although this book is for young adults, as a mother of a 12 year old I wanted to read it myself. What a great story and easy for the younger crowd to comprehend as it's not to complicated but gives a good view of the times. I'm hoping my 12 year old is as enthusiastic as I was about it. Highly recommend"
1,Disappointing,Don't be mislead by the title of this CD. The music is not played on a Tin Whistle. It is computer generated and doesn't come close to the character and beauty of traditional airs on a real tin whistle.
1,Should have read the review.,"After hearing Joanie Madden play Roisin Dubh, I decided to look for more slow stuff as I learn to play the penny whistle. This CD sucketh mightily. It doesn't even sound like a whistle. I might be able to salvage some value out of it by using it to annoy unwanted houseguests."
1,Accomplished by intrigues,"The nightmare of his political jouney was yet to come.Sadat was mixed pell-mell with intrigues. At one time he was the man of the king (Farouk I), A German - bizarre -'Spy' of very little significance, Assassinator (Ameen Othman), and a military loser.What good are 'personal accounts' in defeat?In the absence of any credibility, such books are outrageous.He is no match to what's written about Nasser, for instance.And he will never be."
3,The people and events of Anwar El-Sadat's life.,"I believe Sadat was one of the Mid East's great men. Here was a person who waged war but desired peace. The world lost a lot when this great man was assasinated by Islamist fanatics. Neither his predecessor Nasser or his successor Mubarak rate in his league. If you have read Sadat's book In Search of Identity, then this book is a rehash of much of what he says in his autobiography. The book expands a little on recent events such as the Israeli bombing of Iraq's nuclear reactor. Sadat condemned Israel for that.If one wanted an overview of what Sadat stood for, this is the book. If one wants more, the reader should read his autobiography."
5,Beautiful voice. Beautiful album.,"I Loovvveee European music. Infact, I don't listen to any American music at all. I have heard numerous European songs and In-Grid stands out as one of the best singers I've heard. Her style is very dancish with beautiful mediterranean sounds. If you liked her first album, Rendezvous, then this is a must have as well. The songs Le Coquin and L'Amoureuse are to die for. Her French is beautiful. After you listen to this album, you will want to run to the store and buy a learn French now book so you can sing along. Honestly though, you don't need to know French to enjoy her music."
3,Not my favorite In-Grid CD but...,"This CD does not show her voice to it's full capacity, but I like her music a lot. I own nearly all her CD's and definitely prefer the songs in French to the English translations. If you like European techno you will like this CD. For those who think she does not have a great voice, check out her Vie en Rose CD. She covers some French classics and while the versions may not be traditional or lyrics complete, her voice gave me goosebumps. It shows off her sound better without the distractions of the techno beat. In-Grid is definitely a wonderful singer and will hopefully be around a long time. Her variety thus far gives me hope she will endure long after techno is passé."
5,Buy this DVD,"If you are a flogging molly fan then you you understand the complexity of their being. They are an amazing 7 person band with rowdy irish/rock/punk instrumentals. But they are not the type of band to be labeled like an item on a shelf at the store, this just adds to how great they are. They define their music, unlike many bands who are defined by the category they have been placed in. They are truly amazing! They very deep lyrically also and if you really want to know what Dave King (lead vocals/ acousitc gutiar/ writer) is meaning in his songs this DVD will enlighten you to some of that. For example my favorite Flogging Molly Song is called What's Left of the Flag. Dave King shows in this DVD just how close the lyrics in the song touch to his own powerful past. Laslty, within the DVD Dave King states and proves that Flogging Molly can hang with anyone at a live show, buy this DVD and you will agree with him and me."
5,product review,I love this and I would tell any and everyone to get out and buy this CD it is an amazing buy. I promise you will be glad you bought it.
4,Two hot chicks with tats and bottles of booz,"i was just skipping through a few second hand CDs in the shop, when this little gem appeared. i looked at the picture and imagined it would sound like a light hearted riot grrrl piece of sexual brilliance and i was not at all dissapointed. i judged this book by its cover and i was right, so i give my self a rating of 5 stars for that and the CD a rating of 4 stars just cuz bikini kill and bratmobile get 5 so the budget girls cannot."
3,"Item delivered on time, was as described","It is an interesting introduction into learning history. Providing eight different perspectives of what history is, and what it isn't.I recommend it to anyone who lacks interest in the taking of history courses."
5,Warms the Heart,"Where Are You Christmas is a wonderful original holiday song written by Mariah Carey, James Horner and Will Jennings. Mariah was slated to sing it, but there were conflicts within her record label. So the song was passed onto Faith Hill, who proves more than ever she has holding power as a balladeer. Her vocals shine on this song, she emotes so much emotion in the song its unbelievable. Another holiday classic, thank you to the songwriters and Faith Hill, for another great song."
1,Deceptive,"I purchased this CD after watching Faith Hill on a Christmas Show on PBS. She sang ""Where are you Christmas"" It was wonderful. So when I saw this CD, I though it was the same audio from the special I saw. NO. This is a Karaoke CD with Faith Hill singing this one song and three other instrumentals that you can sing to. This is very deceptive."
5,Excellent,Excellent. Faith Hill is spectatular singing this song. I also loved the musical renditions with the different techniques. I would recommend this cd.
2,"Case is OK, not the clip!","The case itself looks pretty good and it fits my Sony Katana well. The problem is with the belt clip. When I first got it, it was very hard to get the phone on and off of the clip. Actually, now the phone doesn't even come off of the clip because the release is broken. Then after about a week or so, the detent in the swivel mechanism broke. Now the phone spins around instead of staying horizontal to my belt which is one of the reasons I like these kind of cases. I guess if you don't use a clip, the case is OK for the price."
2,sanyo katana protective stingray leather case,i love how the case looks and it does protect the main screen as well as the outter screen and the keys. but my only problem was that i was unable to fully close the phone all the way...it would stay slightly open and when i check my phone in the morning my battery would be really low even though i hadnt used it. sometimes i would even have to remove the top part and just keep the back on. im really considering in getting another cover for my katana 6600 phone.
3,Cell Phone Case,"Fits phone well, however, it is basically impossible to charge the phone without removing the lower half of the case. Case does not appear to made of leather. Package describes it as being made of ""durable, flexible material"" - whatever that is."
4,Good but slow,This pump works fine but for alittle more money I should have gotten a larger capacity. It took a long time to pull the necessary vacuum in a small air conditioner system. I used the standard oil that came with it and eventually changed it out with premium oil. The premium oil made a big difference in time and level of vacuum.
5,good vacuum pump,I have borrowed or rented vacuum pumps in the past and this pump does just as well as any I have used before. It just does the job. What else is there.
1,"A note about the widescreen A. Wehner ""EighT""","While many times, especailly today, programs are filmed in widescreen, Dragon Ball Z was filmed in fullscreen, and the widescreen version, as shown in numerous Internet screenshots will crop off a considerable amount of the image and alter the original intentions of the animators. No offense to anyone, but I believe that customers should be notified that they are NOT recieiving the complete product prior their decision to purchase. FUNimation is capabale of so much better than this, and it is disappointing."
3,Still Too Early To Say,"Being a big fan of anime I love watching all my favourite shows in the original Japanese language with the English subtitles. At first glance watching DBZ in Japanese was great however I was disappointed that Goku's Saiyan name is Kakkarot (The U.S. name) and not Kakkarotto (The Japanese name) also in Japanese they are known as Saiya-jin and ever though you hear it the subtitle reads Saiyan. Is this really the Japanese version of my favourite anime or is this Funimation's version of what the Japanese episodes should be? You might think I'm being foolish by making a big issue over minor things but I ask you if someone took your favourite book and reprinted it with errors, your favourite movie and remade it with differences, wouldn't you make an issue of it?"
4,Classic,"If you grew up watching this show as a kid like I did, you'll love the dvd set. Don't expect a lot of extras or behind the scenes stuff--what is there is pretty boring. But as a person who does not do anime, this was a great buy and I'm planning on getting the other seasons."
5,Awesome Season,I got this season and as soon as i started watching it i realized that i missed a few episodes back in the old days and maybe even forgot some and when watching this it was like if it was the first time seeing it and got to say that is an awesome feeling. I recommend to get all the seasons.
4,Impressed,"I am impressed, this is a must have. For those that love dbz, this is the item for you. Uncut, remastered, high definition, original japanese version + soundtrack, english subs, english version/japanese soundtrack, widescreen..and alot more! I enjoy having this..definately looking forward to purchase the next season. This makes a definate good collection."
5,"They promised a new experience, ... and I got it !","Hey I'm from Germany so please dont be angry about my english.A lot of people wrote that this box set is not as good as the japanese.OK... but then dont buy it !This Episodes wich are newly remastered have a completely new feeling and IT IS a completely new experience, and in my Opinion it is a lot more fun to watch the remastered episodes ! And even the widescreen cropping is giving a new look to the Episodes, all is new !Because the colors look more realistic and its just beautifull.AND YES the automatic noise reduction sometimes looks disturbing but it looks perfekt 99% of the time.So do not grumble about funimation they did a good job !And before you are angry about the set and write bad reviews.. dont buy it because nobody forced you watch it !!For all the Dragonball Z fans worldwide i can just recommend the set for you it is a lot of fun watching it."
3,disk one was cracked,when i first opened it i was exited and expecting no problems but when i opened the case disk one was cracked and sctached and instently i checked the others along with the other sesons i got (1-9) both seson 2 and 3 had cracked disks in them the rest were fine im just glad the they let me get a replasement.
4,Love Season 1,"Mr grandson is a big Dragon ball Z fan. He was very excited to get the first three seasons, especially #1."
5,It's just like I remember it!,"I absolutely am a geek and I loved DBZ as a kid. Lately I've had a craving for it so I purchased the DVD. I'm actually watching it as I write this review :D But to me, this is just as good as the TV show I remember and I am very impressed with the DVD."
5,Too Many Whiny Babies,"First, this is one of the best sets that FUNimation has released. Second, and most prominent in every review I've read, the screen cropping. There is some missing, obviously, from the picture, but this does not cause a big problem. The reviews are biased and people spend way too much time watching a perfectly good show frame by frame to pick out flaws in 20 year old film. I think this is a good set, especially for the money. If you want a good story, amazingly revised animation and color from an old show, and pure all out good fun, buy this set, but please, please don't complain because you cannot see the left side of Yajirobe's cheek or Gohan's dragonball on his hat. That is too picky, especially after all the work that went into the revision of this wonderful and miraculous show."
1,Do not buy anything from this seller! Worst customer service EVER!! I'm a sales spec myself.,Do not buy anything from this seller ripp my off. DVD BAD stinch of cigarettes and POOR quality picture. If you want this DVD package go to your nears electronic store(Recommend BEST BUY)worth spending full price ($30 dollars)
4,I missed a lot as a kid,"This new version of the clasic show is fully uncut. As a child I remember watching this show in the very early 80s at 6am in the morning. The show was HEAVILY editted. This version shows the entire show. Yes, there is some editing to make it widescreen and so forth, but watching it on a high dev TV in widescreen is a lot of fun. I didnt miss the small ammount that they cut off to make it widescreen."
5,"Finally, DBZ on DVD!!!","Back in my elementary and middle school days, I use to watch Dragonball Z about every day. I waited patiently for each new episode with great anticipation. Unfortunately, if you missed one episode, you missed it for good until the season was over. I hated that aspect of it all. Finally, years later, the most popular anime ever created hits the DVD shelves. I admitt I'm not really an anime fan but DBZ has always captivated me with it's interesting characters and incredible detail and action sequences. Now fans can own the complete series uncut, fully remastered both audio and visual wise. Excellent!! ALso included is the original Japanese dialouge and music, a interesting option to enjoy DBZ in its original form. If you're a die-hard fan this is a great way to start off your collection with the season that started it all, the Saiyan or Vegeta saga. Starring in my opinion the most thrilling and greatest character ever, Vegeta!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Season One,I about 20 years old and have been watching Dragon Ball Z as well as other Anime TV show and movies. I bought the first season because I wanted to see some Dragon Ball Z but it was it on the TV. So I went looking for some and I found the first season with 39 in a box set. I really enjoyed watching all of the show. The show were better then I expected. Which is to say that I didn't expect a whole lot of a change from the TV shows but they were the best I had very seen of Dragon Ball Z. The shows were so good that I came back and got the second and third seasons. I'm planning right now to buy the rest of the seasons but need so money to do so.
3,Spanish Audio & Full Screen,"I am a huge fan of Dragon Ball Z. I have been waiting so long to see this season been released, but unfortunately this set doesn't include Spanish Audio. There are a lot of fans out there who watched these animated series in Spanish and we will love to buy them to watch them again, but not in English. In summary, my message to Funimation will be: Please don't forget your Spanish speakers market! Also, I will prefer a full screen rather than a wide-screen version.Thanks!"
1,disapointed!,"I HAD RESENTLY BOUGHT THIS ITEM, AND COME TO FIND OUT DISK 3 WAS THE WRONG ONE INSERTED IN THE BOX. INSTEAD IT WAS REPLACED WITH SEASON 2'S DISK 3. BAD BUSINESS MAN. I GOT IT FROM THE SELLER JON ALLEN (ACTOR),ET AL"
4,Good product for the price.,Pros:Super cheap ($13.17)Great showStill had bookletCons:Missing sleeveDisc one very scratched and hard for DVD player to read but I was able to eventually watch the whole disc.
1,widescreen ruins it and missing insert songs to!,"I would buy these set, if it wasn't for the widescreen, widescreen ruins it, and missing insert songs doesn't help the set either! all copies of this mockery should be burned! case closed!"
2,Remas-TURD. The way it wasn't meant to be seen...,"Good things about this release:1. Price per episodeBad things about this release:1. Color's horribly altered, despite Funi's claim that they're ""original""2. Video is horribly cropped. It was a TV show, like any TV show you would have seen on the tube here in america. It was intended to be seen in the 4:3 aspect ratio. Not 16:9... not the ""Vista Size"" that some OVA's produced during that time used. This is NOT how the show was supposed to be presented.3. Noise reduction/Edge Enhancement.. blurs every bit of texture out of the backgrounds and characters. Terrible.It's trash, plain and simple... barely worth a rent and rip."
1,down with widescreen,"I would gladly buy this product if it were fullscreen, the way the show was meant to be. I wish Funimation would quit butchering my favorite anime."
4,Loyal DBZ fan's review,"ok, here is what I believe of this box set. I have been buying the dbz box sets since 2001. This was such a good buy. I cant believe the amount of people complaining about the widescreen image. I just started watching the episodes last night, and I was astounished with the video and sound quality of this box set. I got the set for 25 dollars, and it was such a fantastic deal. The special features lack a lot, but i dont really care for that kind of stuff anyway. Basically, the wide screen format takes away extra clouds and the top of people's hair which is fine considering you get to see more of the horizontal picture. To sum up my review, I would say thisIf you are extremely picky with video, then this set is not for you.If you are looking to get DBZ this is a perfect box set."
1,love dragonball z but,I love dragonball z it's my favorite anime but when I got this from amazon disc 5's holder was broken this has happened to me before with dragonball z got season 9 opened it disc 5's holder was broken but season nine I got at target so that is why I gave this a low rating if the holder was not broken I would have gave this a 5 get the dragon set's not orange set's
3,Dragon Ball Z,"I am a great lover of dragon ball, z, and gt. But they are putting this box set out in widescreen. Which is ruining the show. I've seen screen shots of the way its suppose to be and the new widescreen screen shot. You are losing alot of the picture from the top and bottom. Roughly about 20%. Its suppose to be seen in 4:3 ratio. I would buy it if it was showed in the original way, the way it is suppose to be."
2,Sadly missing episode guide booklets,"I am a huge fan of Dragon Ball Z. I have been satisfied with the Funimation remastered DVDs for years now. However, I am very upset because with the fact that my order of Dragon Ball Z Season 1 and Dragon Ball Z Season 2 from Amazon did not arrive with their episode guide booklets. When I have purchased these remastered sets in the past from other retailers, I have received an episode guide booklet. I am disappointed with Amazon for not including these in my order. They can be very helpful to those who are deeply into the Dragon Ball Z series just as I am. To conclude, don't buy this product thinking that it will come in a COMPLETE set."
5,Amazing no matter what anybody says,"Finally a dvd that does this series justice. As a lifetime fan i was excited that i heard about these uncut dvd's (mostly because they had more than 4 episodes on them.) After i purchased them i read online about the whole cropping issue. I was saddened because i already ordered 3 of them. When i watched it however I found out that even on a regular television, the cropping doesn't really affect it that much. I would highly recommend this product to any die hard fan of dragon ball z."
2,disliked,I purchased the product thinking it would be more like a segment I saw on tv about this form of workout. I disliked the quality of the dvd. I was not impressed with the workout either. i would not buy again. I wish I had listened to other reviews.
3,Good overview,"It's a good overview of the technique, but very long. It would be better if it was divided into sections of perhaps 1/2 hour long, and you could choose a section at a time. I was hoping to use it instead of going to a class, but I prefer classes. I haven't used it much, but I will try it a couple more times and see if it can work for me."
4,Nice mix of learning and fun,"My 3 year-old really enjoys this game. It is perfect for a child who is learning her capital letters, but who is not quite ready for phonics yet. Also, while the graphics aren't superb, they are good enough for a pre-schooler and make her feel like she is interacting with the show. The CD-ROM also has a nice variety of games where different skill sets are tested. My only reservation is that that the software seems to have a few glitches on my Windows XP."
3,No valve on the stove!,"This is a mean stove that puts out serious heat. Great for our outdoor kitchen. We often cook Chinese stir-fry at home and this saves our indoor kitchen from the greasy odor.But there's a what I believe to be a fundamental design flaw. The valve that controls the flame is located at the propane tank connection, not at the stove. Unfortunately, this means adjusting the flame while cooking just got a lot troublesome, especially when the flame is on full open and you need to leave the wok for 10 seconds to turn down the flame. This 10 seconds of unattendance at your wok could potentially ruin a meal or worse, the wok.That's why I give it this a big downgrade - a stove that is as hot as this one should come with a valve at the stove side, not at the tank."
4,Fire it up and become the star of the show,"This is definitely a conversation starter. One that produces great party food too. Camping, parties, dinner... used it everywhere.Definitely has some personality. Hot is great for a wok, but can easily get too hot if you are not watching.Had to replace the regulator that died just after a year. Got an adjustable one to replace it so now I can kick in the ""afterburner"" Haha!"
3,Be careful - the sound quality is not that great,I bought this CD because I wanted to have a nice modern recording in very good sound quality - sorry to say that I am dissappointed because altough the recording reveals a lot of orcesthral detail it is somehow artificial and colourless with no real feeling of presence - I of course use my ears and my equipment (and used several CDs for comparison)- do not want to say anything about the interpretation but if you want to buy this CD because of really good sound quality - be careful before you make your decision!
4,BOLD WORTHWHILE VERSIONS OF THESE MASTERPIECES,"These versions of the 2 Brahms concertos are truly exciting. The orchestral playing is muscular and dynamic to a degree I have never heard before. The only reservation I have about this first-rate set comes in Brahms Concerto #2. The 2nd movt of #2 is played too fast and loses the gravitas that can come from this amazing movement. Also, the cello soloist in movt 3 plays like a high school amateur...this sublime movt is marred by the crude, bumpy playing of the solo cello...too bad.Overall, you will not go wrong with this set."
5,"Strong, good detail","I'm a ""dumb"" music lover. I listen a lot, don't know why I like stuff, but this is my 3rd set of these concertos and it is the best. I am very happy I bought it."
3,Average,"Brahms: Majestic, lush, tender, incredibly romantic. I'm gonna have to recommend the Gilels, Jochum version. Nothing on this version improves on that, neither orchestra or piano. Usually I can find passages where one version is better or at least as good in a different way. Not a bad performance but on this one no, cannot recommend it. Gilels, Jochum, great sound, great piano, great performance.I have an OOP Barenboim/Mehta I like better too, but I'm gonna stick by the Gilels, Jochum."
5,New benchmark recordings of the Brahms 1st and 2nd,"If you've ever heard - really heard - Nelson Freire play, then you'll need no further encouragement to acquire this 2-cd set. These performances are breathtaking in their intelligence, subtlety and emotional depth. Here is a towering artist, at the peak of his form. Don't miss out!"
4,playing fantastic,"The playing on both these concerti, with respect to both pianist and orchestra, as has already been noted is impeccable. I have many recording of these concerti and the pianism and orchestral performance here is superior to all. The only quibble is indeed the fact that this is a LIVE recording. When listening on high quality equipment with high quality headphones, the audience (and orchestral!) noise is not insignificant. In fact, there are times when it is incredibly distracting. The other aspect of this is that it is obvious at times that the engineers ""edited"" out some background noise by changing recording frequencies which is at times extremely annoying and, to a perfectionist, will interfere with the enjoyment of the superb performances."
5,This book is Great!!!,I began reading this book and could not put it down. This book reallymade pieces of the puzzle fall together. If you are into Civil War History---you have to have this book. If you are into Kentucky History--you have to have this book.
4,My Brother bought it and the show Rules!(By Joey),"A girl named Kagome Higurashi. A Half-Demon Inuyasha.An evil girl Yura. Aninnocent girl is sucked up into an ancient well. She releases a Demon. Actually, a half - Demon who is Inuyasha.He is trying to steal the sacred Shikon no Toma jewel from Kagome. A crow snatches it and BOOM! Inuyasha n' Kagome hit the crow and POP goes the Shikon.So they look for pieces.An Evil Girl Yura knocks Kagome down the well back home. Now he must fight Yura. Also it contains the legend of Kikyo Inuyasha's Physcho X.9+(Mild violence, Minor Language,Mild Brief nudity(Nothing shows))"
5,I love it,"You know I love Inuyasha; the story, the characters, the animation. It has everything you want in a great story. If you liked the TV show then you should buy this. First I couldn't believe they didn't finish it in anime and now the ending isn't even available in manga in the US, I already sent a letter to Viz and they never got back to me about it. Maybe if enough people start demanding it, they might actually give us what we want."
2,Limited Use,I can't believe they couldn't do better. This program looks like it was written 10 or 12 years ago. If you are a complete newbie you may find this easy to use software a good place to start. If you want to be creative - look elsewhere.
1,user review,"If you want to use the templates provided, this works ok. Customizing is a nightmare. Getting it to print correctly is almost impossible and the help is useless. I'm going to try something else."
2,This may be OK for home users,This product may serve a home user fine. But in our network we cannot have our users needing administrative rights just to use this product. It is poorly written code in my opinion.
3,Young boys football stories,"""Football followers all over the country will hail with delight this new and thoroughtly up-to-date line of gridiron tales. "" Football story for young boys."
2,Parking space,"One would expect all kinds of insights regarding acting from someone as accomplished as Gambon. Regrettably, most of this book deals with trivia and gossip relating to Gambon's hobby (gun collecting and restoration) as well as the import he places on having a parking space near the theatre in which he performs. As for acting, it is, for him, basically a form of showing off (the claim is repeated at least three times). Sometimes personal anacdotes disclose much about the person and the deeper dimensions of their world. This is not the case here."
3,Good mystery involving gangsters..,"""Paint the Town Red"" is the second in the Wilcox series, but feels like the earliest. Set in 1929, it takes place just before the Great Crash. An old flame from Carl's past, Eleanor, is staying at the Wilcox hotel. Carl has to run it because his parents were in a bad car accident, and are still recovering. Soon, everyone from G-Men, to Chicago gangsters think Carl knows where some missing money is. It is up to Carl to find the missing money before he gets killed. Good story, with enough for most mystery fans. It really does feel like 1929 South Dakota."
1,Beware: This is Spooky Stuff,"This John Tesh disc is one of the strangest CDs that I have ever heard. After listening to ""From this Moment"" for just a few seconds, I choked on my Cheetos not once but twice. The music was quite good, though at the time I did not realize (though I should have) the diabolical qualities of the music to which I was listening. During the first time I heard ""Can't Live a Day,"" I was overcome by waves of depression. I know that John Tesh is a pretty laid back guy, so I'm surprised that he would create music that would further exacerbate the emotional fragility of his fans. Ever since then I have been looking for equipment that can play that tune backwards, because there has gotta be a hidden message there somewhere."
4,whew,"Origin is one of the cake-takers for fast tech metal. The opposite of subtlety. Precise, brutal, intense rhythmic passages. It will make you move. Gets better upon repeated listenings. Main weakness is a lack of overall dynamics, so if you're not listening carefully, it begins to have a background grindcore effect. Recommend ""Disease Called Man""."
5,Excellent Book,"I am a mediocre piano player with some knowledge of chords, majors, minors, diminished, 10ths, 7ths, 9ths, etc..., but lack a real understanding of how to properly structure and use the chords when I play. I often struggle with creating the right harmony of notes.I just started reading and practicing the first chapter and analyzing how Jimmy Amadie's instruction fits my style of creating chords. So far I can say Jimmy's chord structure rules are excellent. Over the next year or two I hope to work through each page of the book and practice at my leisure using his guidance to fully enhance my sound.I am very pleased and look forward to what I will learn in each chapter right through to the very last page."
1,Cheap plastic mouse,"avoid it.Mine arrived with the left button broken, making a pityfull broken noise.I never did such a mistake buying a device for my computer :(I thought I was buying some quality stuff :((avoid it, go for a microsoft mouse instead.it will save you the disappointment."
4,Overall a good buy,"I bought this mouse because I play 1st person shooter-games a lot. (I wanted something accurate that can be used by left-handed people like me).It has 7 buttons in total and they can all be customized, using the great driver software you get with the mouse.Pros: This mouse is very accurate, it's a must-buy mouse if you're a gamer (or left-handed :P). It fits very well and you get used to it quickly.Cons: (A very small one) My first reaction was that the buttons on the sides of the mouse were way too sensitive. I kept on pressing them all the time while playing online games. I learned living with that and now I don't press the buttons at all.Overall I'm happy I bought it. I'm probably not going to change this mouse before it's worn down - if that ever happens. And then it looks great as well!"
4,Love it but...,"Its a very good mouse and I love it, but the software could be better. I have issues with assigning functions to the buttons within games, it can be worked around but its still a pain. Overall though its a good product and its comfortable which I find very important in a mouse."
5,awesome,the mouse is the most responsive and accurate mouse i have ever used. a wonderful peice of hardware.
3,GREAT MOUSE WITH FEW PROBLEMS,I bought this mouse to use with my dell xps 700.It is very conferrable and precise. It work very well and the software they give you is very easy to install and easy to manage. The buttons on the size could be programmed to what you like it to do. **I am running windows** The only problem is that it sometimes doesn't power up and you have to pull the USB cable out and plug it back in. the other thing is that the software is not Microsoft certified means Microsoft didn't approve it.in all other cases the product is great
4,Very nice,"I was a little hesitant switching over to this mouse from my old Logitech, primarily given the complaints about the button placement, but since I am not a hardcore gamer and primarily just want a solid mouse for everyday personal and business use, I took the leap and came out unscathed (for the most part).The main complaint I do have which I think has been noted is the fact the the mouse is relatively flat overall, and given the precision (read: low resistance) of each button... just mildly resting your ring finger onto this gadget will produce a right click, which after a few times can become somewhat annoying. I have learned for the most part to change my hand rest position to avoid this, and have thus dealt with this minor gripe comfortably.Overall, the mouse is easy to install, handle, and it's very responsive. Not to mention uber-cool looking with it's awesome red glow.Worth the purchase."
4,Fast response,"I've been working with this mouse for a few weeks now. It's very quick and responses to the slightest touch. I got this mouse for two reasons... it's black and red color and the side buttons. My last mouse had a side button and I wanted my next one to have it also. Because it's so quick I had to get used to the fact that the slightest touch gives you motion on the screen. The buttons are placed well, but the side buttons are closer together. If I'm not careful I'll hit the front button instead of the rear button. Otherwise it's a great mouse for both gamers and the novice like me."
5,Mens Gel Kayano 13 (green) Review,I have had my Asics Kayano 13's for about 9 months. They are worn out from action . I have worn them on all sorts of off road terrain and also on track . I compete in running events almost every weekend .I have tried many shoe manufacturers and models .I will buy another pair. These are brilliantly comfortable and lightweight. I recommend them. Price is a little high but these are EXCELLENT ... Gerry K
5,Best shoes on the market!,"These Asics are much better than the $89 and below models. The Kayano's form fit to your foot and have a better overall design. I have run in the cheaper Asics models for years and now that I switched to the higher end models I will never go back. Also, it comes in a 4 E which is good for those of us with wide feet. Very good product and I give it 5 stars!"
2,This shoe design has a SERIOUS flaw.,"Your big toe will chew through the top of the mesh-like construction in under 60 days. Atop that, I got the wrong color, even after the seller ASSURED me that this was a defect with the AMAZON.com website.Currently awaiting a refund from the seller."
5,Great purchase,"Very nice shoes. Perfect for running, walking and everything else. My third from the same model!"
3,Metza Metza,"This is basically a parenting book designed for Jewish parents who don't want to be too Jewish, but just want a little Judaism in their life and a way to pass on the spirit of the religion to their offspring. There are some good ideas, and some interesting thoughts, but the overall impression is not one of someone who knows what he is talking about. There's a good reason for that: the author himself is not a parent (or at least wasn't when the book was written), and uses his friends' ideas, many of which contradict each other. It is pretty common for a chapter to include advice like this: ""You could try doing this...But if that doesn't work you should try doing it the opposite way and seeing if that works.""For a self-published parenting book written by someone who isn't a parent the book is well-done."
4,At the Cantina,"Much of the great Mexican songwriter's material has been produced with full, lovely, glossy arrangements-and it's great. If you love Manzanero's swell romantic music this album will give you the feeling of traditional Mexican folk expression. Mainly trios, unadorned and basic but Spanish guitar and heavenly harmony singing-just the way you'd expect at the local cantina. Very authentic!"
1,unhappy,"Was nice to receive order quickly, however only three of the four window visors came with the adhesive tape on them!!! A big pain had to go through trouble of getting my own double sided adhesive tape, spending more money! To make it worse it was the front driverside window that is used the most.!!!!?????? Not Happy!!!"
5,To Judge a Book By the Cover,"I taught myself to play piano from this anthology, a few years back. that is not to say that this is a novice's work-- we are not looking at reader's digest. No, this collection contains EVERY piano masterpiece you'd want to play, as well as arrangements of operatic, symphonic and choral works. I highly recommend it, if you can ever find a copy. I particularly like the design of the book, which seems to have been constructed for musicicians-- convenient page turns, easy to read scoring... and you cannot get beyond the breadth of it... from early baroque to early 20th century, this book is truly what it claims to be-- a collection of piano masterpieces"
2,The music is too small to read,"The pieces in this book are printed in such a small font that they are almost unreadable. This book is only good as a reference. Also, a book this size should have a spiral binding."
1,not very pleasing to the ear,I have heard several artist's that play the Native Flute. I hear their soul. This CD does not have it. very hard on the ears. Verymonotone. Pass this up if you can. There are several newcomers with the art and passion for the flute.Forgotten Warriors is better left forgotten....
1,does not work with ie6,"If you use Internet Explorer 6 the cd burning software DOES NOT WORK! As soon as you attempt to drag files or copy an entire cd you will get a ""illegal operation"" notice and the program will close. You cannot burn a cd. The troubleshooting guide will tell you to uninstall IE6 and use an earlier version. After much e-mail correspondence their tech support (a JOKE) will tell you the same. They say they are aware of the problem but really have no fix! By the way if you review their own system req's they say that IE 5.0 or higher is req'd. Sales and tech support are on different planets!"
5,this is the best i say ...,Ok well first i wasnt to sure about this program then when i figured out how to use it it was th best. Well anyways i hope you buy this product exspecially for converting wma to mp3 or just make your files smaller. It also works good for picture editing and all that other stuff. I like this product but some people dont oh well thanks for reading and ttyl.
1,Junk.,"This software has been an extreme disapointment.It's basically a loose bundling of packages from 4 different companies. No integration, just 5 packages from 4 different companies under one installer.One of the packages wouldn't even install properly.Learningco doesn't seem to have any support for this product anywhere on their web site, nor any updates.The original vendors of the packages won't support them because they're not FULL versions of the included software. You will, however, run across many opportunities to pay extra to upgrade to supported ""full"" versions during your quest for help.Junk."
1,burn photo?,Just received this software. I bought it mostly to burn photos. I am unable to do this. Someone please tell me how to do it. I am a novice at this. As soon as I can figure out how to burn photos I will change my rating. Thank you .
2,Hard to Read,I sent these as a gift and now that I see them and played bridge with them I am thinking of getting my friends a different set. The image on the face of the cards covers the number in one corner and not the other. This makes it hard to read and makes the hand hard to evaluate at a glance since half the cards in your hand are white in the corner and half are grey or tan. I have never seen another deck that is like this. In the future I will be careful to check that the cards don't have to be all turned the same way to be reasonably easy to read. I will never purchase another deck from Laurel Ink - if anyone in their company had just tried to play with them once they would have redesigned them. It would not have taken much to fix.
4,Simple and pretty.,Another component needed to do a clean wiring system on a show car. This brand has proven to be good for both utility and dressing up the wiring.
1,less than you would expect,"We have this dictionary, but it doesn't work the same way as your normal German/English dictionary. It is mostly ""one way"", i.e. Inuktitut to English. There is a short ""index"" in the back for English to Inuktitut, but it is hardly comprehensive. Also, there is no assistance with pronunciation. This becomes an issue when trying to understand what the difference might be between the sound of ""k"" and ""q"" or ""a"" and ""aa"".All in all, a frustrating book to use."
5,Awesome set of flips!,"These are the most comfortable flips I've ever had. The straps are padded on the insides with neoprene, the foot bed has some actual support and is a multi-density material that is both softly and firmly cushy and feels velvety smooth on your feet. Most flips I tried were heavy, like a solid block of rubber. But these are light on the feet. And on top of all that they look decent, a nice clean style to them. The only issue I've found is that the smooth foot bed can let your foot slip if you're climbing at an angle on something, but hey, they're flips, not full sandals. This model has been replaced for 2012, which looks to be equivalent. I'll get another pair in a different color. The price is a little high, but its worth it for these babies."
4,A PGP - pretty good program,"I have not seen or used a lot of other Windows-based programs of this nature, but this one is easy to use out-of-the-box for the average user. The only thing that I have come across that is somewhat difficult is the creation and modification of print templates, which is only necessary if you want a different print format than any of the many templates provided. To get a columnar listing of your mailing list data you probably will want to create your own template. The software author should make this process simpler and bug free (template creation and modification currently has a few bugs, which can be worked around if you have the patience). This opinion is also from an IT administrator. I have no idea why an IT person would find this program difficult to use."
1,What a Nightmare,"What should be an easy to operate machine is nothing more than a giant nightmare. It's next to impossible to move data from an existing address label list to its program, the labels jam and peal off when they get a hair to do so, etc.So mine is sitting on the floor in my office taking up space. I have never successfully used it. Save your money. It's easier to address envelopes by hand."
4,The Voices Shakira Put In My Head !!!!!!!!,[...] This doll speaks to me and is so great. it has opened my eyes and I want to be exactly like her. I want to get my legs lengthened and dye my hair blond. Bye the doll and shell be your friend
2,Paint job needs work,"The figures are fine in and of themselves, but the paint job on many of the figures was quite poorly done."
4,MARVEOLUS SPECTACULAR,"This book's cover alone is worth it all!!!! Contains ""fresh"" photos of Scarlett contenders as well as documenting the quest for the ""right cast"".This book is a MUST for all GWTW collectors!"
3,Tang poems in English,"This book contains the 300 Tang poems in both Chinese and English. The translation is nice and can assist English-reader to appreciate these famous ancient Chinese poems. It would be nicer, if the translator has even included the old stories behind certain phases. However, since there can be so many different possible interpretations of different terms, it sure is difficult to do so. After all, to fully appreciate the poems, one must be able to read them in Chinese, while the English translation can be an assistant only."
3,Tang poems in English,"This book contains the 300 Tang poems in both Chinese and English. The translation is nice. It would be better, if the translator has included the old stories behind certain famous phases. After all, to fully appreciate these ancient poems, one must be able to read them in Chinese and understand thir background. However, the translation is a good assistant for English-reader to begin with."
4,Don't believe the criticism,"I disagree with the negative reviews here. Especially the person who says, ""This book would presume by its cover to prove that Buddhism is nihilism"", and then goes on to say why this is supposedly the case.First of all, Collins does nothing of the sort, and no respectable scholar would say that Buddhism is ""nihilism"". The book even goes out of it's way to talk about references to the self in the canonic texts, and he specifically describes why the Buddha's view on the self is not nihilism.What the people who criticize this book are reacting to, I think, is that Collins is an academic, and not a follower of Buddhism, per se. For what it's worth, he is a highly respected scholar at the University of Chicago, which should be some confirmation of his abilities, and I assure you he is highly respected in the field."
4,Power to the music,The second studio cd from this guys is one of the best releases of 2000. The guitar playing is top notch and John and Bruce's vox are in fine form. A must have for any Crue/Kiss/Cheap Trick fan. Don't get locked out of the Blue Room!
4,Union pump out another hit,"Union pump out another hit with ""The Blue Room"". The album is a step ahead of the self titled album. It is heavier and meatier. This album really is ""Carnival of Souls"" meets ""Motley Crue"". The band explores new territory with beefier guitar and heavier bass. Jamey Hunting dominates the album on his bass. Brent Fitz seems to have grown as a drummer as well. Bruce and John, what can I say? They are on. John has his characteristic rough vocals, and a heavy rhythm guitar part that resembles his work with the Crue. Bruces' performance doesn't dissapoint with an excellent showing of guitar leadership. A veteran like Bruce has to work hard for mobility, Bruce achieves this with his stellar performance on ""The Blue Room"". While the album is slightly less appealing than the self titled release lyrically, it is still good and worth your money."
4,Good follow-up album,"The Blue Room is a little more band-oriented than the debut which is good. The lyrics could've been written better, but the music makes up for it. This album will grow on you, it has grooves and rocks. The first four songs are good, as well as, ""Dear Friend"" and ""I Wanna"". ""Who Do You Think You Are"" is the only downside on this CD. Its lyrics (mostly one-word), do not make a good song. Maybe an edited-version will be out soon."
4,3.5 stars,"A bit heavier than their debut, Union, fronted by the fantastic John Corabi, seem intent on going in a different direction with this release.To some extent, this album suffers from the new direction, as the heaviness of the music makes Corabi's vocal performance, which is a strong point of every album he's done, play second fiddle. The music isn't bad...far from it! But it lacks some of the depth and character found on their debut."
5,Rock and Roll The Way It Should Be,"Kulick and Corabi have something to be very proud of, it's called ""The Blue Room"". They have produced a winner. This CD is a classic! Union shows us what rock music is supposed to sound like. All those new bands out there now need to listen to this and learn what real music is all about. Every song is on the mark. ""Who Do You Think You Are"", ""Do Your Own Thing"" and ""Hypnotized"" will hook you immediately. ""Dear Friend"" Bruce Kulick's shining moment will grab your heart. If your a fan this CD is a must. If you've never heard of Union after giving this a listen you will be a fan. Guaranteed! John and Bruce prove rock music is very much alive and well in ""The Blue Room"""
5,"Union, the band I've been waiting for","This is the best CD I've listen to in a long, long time.Finally the lovers of good rock'n roll have a new band to enter the next millenium.I couldn't imagine a better work than Union's first, but I was prooven wrong big time."
5,Wiggly Fun!,I bought this guitar a few years ago when my son was 3. At the time he was a big Wiggles fan and loved this guitar. Played with it non-stop and to this day (3 years later) it still works. Great for any Wiggles fan.
4,"No, seriously, it's TOO LOUD!","My 3-year-old loves the Wiggles, and this guitar, but I wholeheartedly agree with the others who have noted that it's WAY too loud--this can't be good for toddlers' tender ears, let alone the parents' nerves. I'm really surprised that more parents haven't complained. It's obnoxiously (and I think, dangerously) loud, and for this reason alone, I wouldn't buy it again, even though she loves the toy. I will definitely be trying to find a way to modify it so we don't all go deaf or suffer permanent damage!"
4,Amazing toy from Amazon.,I purchased this guitar for my 3 year old grandson. Since the day it reached his hands he is stuck to it. He is a music lover.He holds it and acts as if he is performing on stage and so cuuute he looks.I highly recommend this toy.
5,Great Toy!,"My little boy got this for his birthday and just cannot put it down. He's wanted a guitar for a long time and this one really fit the bill. It's just so neat and actually plays guitar sounds and not just Wiggles songs. Of all the Wiggle toys, this one is the nicest in my opinion. It's very well made and provides a great deal of entertainment."
5,How Can You Sing & Dance Without A Strap?,"My 2 year old eats, drinks, and sleeps Wiggles. He especially loves Murray. We have had a little plastic guitar for him that we bouht at a second hand store and felt it was time to replace. We chose this guitar because of his love for the Wiggles. He loves it. The biggest complaint was no strap. He even cried about it. We could not come up with a way to fashion one for it, either. How are you going to sing and dance without a strap? Our circut board has mostly worn out. About half of the characters that you touch no longer have a song to sing. This is after 2 1/2 weeks. Despite this, he still plays with it. If it is a guitar it can't be all bad for William. He plays along with Murray everytime he watches The Wiggles!"
5,This guitar is a hit with the grandkids!,I had bought one of these at a consignment shop and my twin grandkids were fighting over it. So i was happy to find another one at a great price. They love to sing and dance with the Wiggles as they play the guitar. Great buy!
5,My 2 boys fight over this toy!,"I bought this guitar for my 2.5 year old son b/c he adores the wiggles. My 16 month old loved it so much that it's become a constant point of contention in our house! They play several of their favorite wiggles songs (including their all time favorite--""Wiggly Party""!). I can't really vouch too much for durability since we've only had it maybe a month and a half, but in that time, we moved cross-country & both boys have stepped on it a number of times. It still works fine :)I'd recommend this toy to all Wiggles fans!"
5,Guitar,All of the songs and sounds on this are exactly like what you hear on TV. Every word is very clear.
4,Two year old grandson enjoys the Wiggles guitat\r,"My 2 year old grandson will use his Wiggles guitar when he is watching a ""Wiggles Video"". He likes to play along with the music on the screen. It is a good choice for this age child."
2,Don't bother with this one.,"My daughter loves The Wiggles! She received the guitar as a gift for Chanukah & played with it endlessly for a few weeks. Now it's sitting in her toy box, & she hasn't touched it in months. The buttons that you press play a portion of the characters' own songs. (i.e., Dorothy the Dinosaur - Romp Bomp A Chomp) It doesn't do more than that.I like The Wiggles. They teach manners, health, colors, numbers, etc. The toy just isn't worth the money. I expected better than I got."
5,Zachary's birthday gift,"This is a gift, for my grandson, who is 2 on Sunday, and he just loves the Wiggles, and watches it on tv every day."
4,GREAT TOY,We bought this toy for our 2 year old daughter after a wiggles concert and she absolutely loves it. Not too noisy or annoying so that's a bonus for parents.
4,A good beat,"My son got this at Christmas when he was 1 years old and never cared much for it, but now that he is two he just finally noticed it and he likes to take it out and listen to the music. We don't watch the Wiggles, my kids just aren't interested, but they do like to listen to the songs, tunes, and beats of the guitar. Very durable because it gets thrown around like crazy in my house."
4,"Not our favorite, but","my 2 yr old daughter got this for Christmas. She LOVES the Wiggles, so obviously adores anything with them on it. It is sturdy and seems to be well-made, but she doesn't seem to get it out of the toybox much anymore. Also, this thing needs volume control and the sound is muffled. Worth it only if you have a die-hard Wiggles fan (like me!)."
3,Small town works its magic on television producer.,"A young woman comes to a small Wyoming town searching for the perfect setting for an upcoming television pilot that the company she works for (and wants to advance in) is making. Too bad her tour guide is the local doctor, who is not at all pleased with the idea of having his hometown corrupted by Hollywood types. Making matters worse is the two hit it off and can't fight the warming chemistry between them. A cute time passer. Recommended."
4,A Pretty Good Basic Book,"Just like most fields, irrigation is evolving quickly as regards new materials, products and standards. Overall, I feel the Ortho book gives good solid information for a do - it - yourselfer. There was no ""BAD"" information per se, and it does demystify the home irrigation system. You can save a lot of money installing your own system. You can also cause a lot of damage doing it incorrectly. This book can give you a good idea whether you can tackle installing a system or not. Use this book along with careful planning, to know what questions to ask either a sprinkler supply distributor or to hire an irrigation contractor."
1,Does not tell how to install a sprinkler system.,"Far too basic. If you want a glossy introduction to sprinklers, but have no plans to actually install a system, this is the book for you.If you want to install a sprinkler system, there are maybe 5 pages of useful information in this book, and not near enough detail to actually break ground. Find another source of information."
4,"Bright light, heavy base",This lamp is replacing a similar one that lasted me for over 10 years. I would have been more pleased if it had been rated for more than a 300 watt bulb.
3,Nice but not as bright as I expected,"I bought a steel finish lamp and hoped for more light from it.It is brightening the place around the lamp, but its light is not bright enoughto spread it to the whole room. I keep it though, it looks good and it makes animprovement... although not as much as I had hoped or expected."
1,awful quality and look,Awful quality. The metal gets marked by fingers and the material stains everything. Unacceptable. The pictures don't demostrate what the product really looks like. They look cheap
2,Polished Steel Halogen Lamp,"Based on the description, I expected a polished steel lamp. The one I received is painted aluminum. It looks like the one I bought quite a few years ago from a local supermarket for less than $20, except this provides much less light. The old one was white and the glass part broke eventually. Since the description states that the power is lower now, I expected less light, but the cheap look was a disappointment. We had a hard time assembling it. Some paint got into the threads of the aluminum body and it had to be cleaned before the column could be screwed onto the base. In addition, one had to be very careful not to force it, otherwise the soft aluminum threads would get destroyed. At $100, this lamp is extremely overpriced. If I payed $20 or $30, I would not complain."
3,Works,"I really wanted a halogen lamp with a dimmer, so I paid the rather high price for this one. It works just as expected, but the price sure does seem high. Also, expect to make a huge mess trying to get it out of the box; have a vacuum cleaner nearby."
1,Cheesy looking and not operational,"I wanted to replace a 20 year old torchiere and was looking for another with a dimmer switch. I also liked the idea of the brushed steel look of this one online, although I imagined it might be a bit overpriced. When I assembled this it was apparent how cheesy the painted ""steel"" really looks up close. However I was still trying to talk myself into liking this because it would be a real hassle to return. Well, never mind. When I plugged it in I couldn't even get the light to turn on. My advice is simple: Don't buy this."
3,Not Well Lit,"All I can say is that I was hoping for more light output then what I got. The room I was putting the lamp into was fairly small, 10x12 with low ceilings. I was expecting a brighter light output. In general though the light was concentrated just above the fixture with no bounce into the room. Which is a shame, it's a nicely built simple fixture with all of the attributes I was looking for. The adjustable knob was at a usable height, the lamp was halogen, it was solidly built and well protected for shipping purposes. I had good service both on the shipping and the return from the seller, I just wish it could put out more illumination. I ended up buying a 300W incandescent fixture and that works a lot better."
3,Halogen floor lamp,It's only 192 watt which is not what I wanted. I thought it was a 300 watt lamp. It's not worth the hassle of a return so I'll keep it and some light is better than none. But it wasn't clear this was 192 watt.
3,"Good for Y2k, led has outdated this relic.",I bought this bulb for my old flashlight which was among the best @ time of purchase. Today it is less bright than some led which cost less than $15.00 and only required (1) AA battery.
1,Not Happy With Monster Cable,"I purchased the cable to go from the wall jack to a Comcast cable box. I purchased it because it is white and is aesthetically better in my white-painted apartment. I had only had this cable service for a week or so when I ordered the cable. A few days after I installed it I noticed that several stations had ""this station should be available shortly"" messages but would never bring them in. Some other stations had pixellation or freezing. I called Comcast thinking it was a problem with their box. The tech came out, plugged in a standard cable and the problem disappeared. The tech observed that the ""stinger"" (the central core wire in the Monster cable) was not long enough and that may have been the cause of the poor connection. I won't buy Monster again because I have a concern that their quality control is lacking, even thought their the product is attractively designed."
1,"Looks great, but doesn't work!","Tried to use this great looking cable from the cable outlet to the cable box. It didn't work! Tried various tests, because it looks so good that I really wanted it to work, but no dice. Even tried it with different TV's! So I had to go back to the ugly back coax that the cable company installed. Bummer!"
5,Monster quality at low Amazon price!,"I purchased this Monster coax cable to connect my cable TV jack to the back of my wall mounted LCD television. I ran this wire through the wall and needed something that I could easily screw unto the televisions antenna jack with limited space. Unlike so many other coax cables, Monster uses large, knurled connectors (for larger fingers?) that allow for easy installation of the cable without slipping when tightening the cable to the jacks. The double shielding seems to work great and I have a clear picture without any visual lines or interference. The cable also is VERY flexible without being stiff so it's easy to route around other components. I purchased four of these because of the EXCELLENT price of $1.70 Amazon offered!Local stores like WorstBuy couldn't touch this price for this quality.In conclusion, if your in need of a flexible, easy to install, gold plated, shielded, 6ft Monster coax cable....... LOOK NO FURTHER!Thanks Amazon!"
5,perfect,there is no need to spend big $$ on cable. this cable works perfectly well and it's short $$.. I really recommend this cable..
2,Warped and marginal non-stick properties,"Within a year the pan warped over half-inch so it wouldn't lay flat on ceramic stove. Also lost non-stick properties. Pan was never overheated and always hand-washed. Hopefully just rare defects, but I've sent it back to Caphalon under lifetime warranty provisions. We'll see."
4,"works well, but annoying in a crunch","It works well but sometimes, if you have to pull back, expect to get a little rope burn since the line that extends is not a flat leash, its a thin (but strong) little rope. I'm sure this design is meant so that the line doesn't tangle when retracting, but, it's annoying regardless. Other than that, I have no problems."
2,OTown rejects,These are the same guys who were not selected for O'Town. The Hawaiian dude who was crying like a woman because he missed his family and girl so much is now all of a sudden front and center on this album!! the other 3 guys at least were man enough to remain cool and confident in the future. Dont belive the hype people
4,Good pop album! Very diverse with the members,I like LMNT's album. I played it a lot 2 summers ago. I felt that they were overlooked that year. I liked Hold It Down and its slow to fast chord changes! I also liked the Middle Western feel of Shangri La. The album opens with a mostly rock edge (Juliet) before shifting to the more catchy pop numbers in the middle. Maybe the album might have come 3 years too late during the pop music boom of the boy bands and male vocal groups. But it was a surprise album that I liked in 2002. Wonder if they're still together.
3,"Alright, cd!","When i first heard ""Hey Juliet"" I thought this album would be soo super. And when i got it, i was disappointed. I only like a couple of songs on this album, and that's it. Other than that, the other songs like I don't even wanna touch, cuz they are just snore fest material!"
5,Soothing soundtrack for a peaceful journey.,"Whether you're listening inside on a rainy day or walking among the trees, this beautiful CD will open your mind to the wonder of Earth and your own connection to her. Multi-layered and nuanced with birdsongs, flute and drum and the healing chants of Cha-das-ska-dum, you'll want to listen over and over again, and will hear something new each time. This is the perfect CD for meditation, yoga, artistic inspiration or relaxation."
3,Good for Relaxation,I like the drums and flute music. But I think a little less singing would be more enjoyable for relaxation. I would recommend this CD.
4,Not a young childrens book but not a real mind teaser either,I did enjoy this as well as the first book in this series. It was well worth reading and I rushed to it after finishing book 1.
5,Dragons,Awesome set of books I will be rereading this one for along time. Worth it to buy it. If u like dragons vet this o e and talons story also which is the first book
5,Fond memories,"Just as I remembered it from a performance in Cleveland back in the '70's, with a few updates that makes it even better. This man's genius can't be measured!"
4,For Brel fans,"This CD is a trip down memory lane for every fan of the great Jacques Brel. While it is technically somewhat reflective of the 1966 acoustics, it has enough modern clarity to satisfy those who demand their quality ""au current"". Most importantly, the songs are the charming ""reality show"" of the '60's that we all fell in love with. If you have fond memories of that time, if you saw the show and remember it well, or if you just want to hear some great human theater, this CD will satisfy."
5,Calling all Brel fanatics!,"Glory hallelujah and thank you, Sony, the original cast is available again in all its magnificence! I hadn't heard this version in 15 years easily, and was less than enthused about the Amazon downloads I'd heard from the revival of a few years ago, so imagine my glee when the original appeared in my recommendations! This is one of those rare shows that only gets more relevant with the years--the one drawback being that it would take a rare group of singers these days to come close to the original quartet."
5,Jacques Brel LIVES!!,This CD is GREAT!! I saw the show back in the 60's and have always wanted the CD. Have the record but who listens to records amymore. The music & lyrics are still meaningful today. I recommend this CD to anyone who likes good melodies & snappy lyrics.
5,Excellent !,"Saw this in the village in 1969 and it brought back a lot of great memories. I have the album and now I am in the process of switching all the ""vinyl"" over to CD's. It will take me a while as it gets pretty expensive trying to do it all at once. To any of you who experienced the magic being 19 in 1969 and awakening to everything around you, this music enveloped it all!"
4,JACQUES BREL for the ages,"JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS brought Brel back into the spotlight (if indeed he ever left). The original off-Broadway production of 1966 became the toast of New York when it first appeared and featured a cast including the delicious Elly Stone.For Elly Stone fans, this reissue is a must-own. For Jacques Brel fans, it is equally so. The masterful song-stylings of Stone with Mort Shuman, Alice Whitfield and Shawn Elliott cannot be beat.Elly Stone delights with ""I Loved"" and later tears at the heartstrings with ""You're Not Alone"". Mort Shuman delivers the sobering ""Next"" with all the anger of innocence lost, and Shawn Elliott is superb with ""Bachelor's Dance"".Highly-recommended."
5,Jacques Brel lives,"Just as I remembered it from my college days, and still as relevant. I can't get the songs out of my head."
1,my brother bought me this LP 30 years ago,"I hated it then and now that it is on CD I hate it still. But I bought the CD for my brother. I like my brother, I hate this CD."
2,Beware of translation,"Being french, I can only love the only original Brel. Some translations are totally out of purpose and do not recreate at all the typical Brel's world."
2,Nothing compares to Brel,"Ooff, sorry to say, but these English interpretations do not at any stage resemble the power, intensity and musical level of the original Brel songs. It's like ""Seasons in the sun"", which only vaguely remembers of it's original ""Le Moribond"". Listen to Brel's legendary 1961 concert in l'Olympia, Paris and judge for yourself!"
2,"SECOND, NO, THIRD BEST!","Any homage to the remarkable Flemish-French singer Jacques Brel (d. 1978) deserves praise but this one doesn't deserve too much praise. It has taken Brel's plangent and often muscular themes and reduced them to stock cabaret gestures and harmonies, sung by sweet, not all that strong voices. The result loses the peculiarly poignant quality Brel's best renditions had, the way he could evoke melancholy without losing muscle, in his tough but utterly romantic style of singing. It is carping to say that I wish certain other songs had been included, particularly ""J'Arrive,"" which is, I feel, just a stunning composition. And the way Brel sang it, whoo!I'd give this 2-1/2 stars (out of 5) if the system allowed half stars, but between 2 and 3 stars, this is more on the 2 side than the 3 for me."
4,Had to edit my review,"I reviewed it before and gave it 3 stars, but as I listened to it a few more times, I came to the conclusion that this is a truly great cd. Kelly Keeling is among the best singers of all times, and Stuart Smith ( although very influenced by Blackmore ) is easily the best guitar player that emerged in 20 years. About my last review, some songs are really crossing over into pop, but it's a pop very well done. And the hard rock songs are really catchy and well composed. I still think you should listen to Guitar Zeus before, tho. The songs are even better and it's a truly 5 star album. Ah, listen to it several times before you make a judgement, it's an album that grows on you. Maybe later I come back and re-review it and give it a 5."
2,Eww,"Presents a load of information on Gann angles, fans, cycles, Elliott Wave, Fib retracements and projections. While most of this material would have merit to those knowledgable in these methods, I found the explanations too vague to be useful. If you are interested in these types of trading methods, there are definitely better books."
3,Why why why did Jensen have to return?!,"I do enjoy this author's books, and more so since the overbearing and too take-charge Jensen left the series. I thought Jessie was delveloping more as her own character and then back he comes in this one (and taking over right where he left off-- yuck). The character of friend/musher Lynn had it right when he questioned Jensen making himself at home in Jessie's new cabin and basically taking over, unasked. I enjoy the Alaska setting and the dog races plus the dogs themselves are a wonderful part of this series. I have the next book in the series ready to start and I hope that Jensen is removed soon (and perhaps finally gone-- dare I say killed? since these are murder mysteries). His character really does not add anything to Jessie's character, and she could find other romantic possibilites when she has a chance to do so. He feels like too-much and she is too-less with him in the picture."
1,So poorly written that I couldn't read it.,"A friend tried listening to this on tape, and she couldn't listen to it.It's a failure in two media."
2,Disappointed,After a long wait for this book I was disappointed to find it not the authors normally great work. The writing style was choppy and hard to follow. The was plot weak and the content not very interesting.
4,Love Alaska mysteries,Enjoyed this book in the series by Sue Henry! I look forward to every book by her. I lived in Alaska for many years and love to hear her descriptions of the places that I love!
4,Not So Bad,"I remember watching this movie back in the early 90s. It was one of my favorites. I bought the movie on DVD about a year ago and watched it again for the first time in years. First thing you notice is the cheesy sets. Oddly enough I still enjoyed watching the show. The fights with the mechs are great to watch for an old school sci-fi fan. This was before CGI was popular, so it leaves a lot to the imagination. I liked the story, the acting wasn't bad at all. Its definitely a classic in my collection."
4,How to find Robot Jox 2,"I loved these movies, but I love just about any ""Hardware"" Science Fiction.But I loved ""Robot Jox 2"" more. Unfortunately they didn't seem to link the two in anything except the advertising at the time. It wasn't until recently that I discovered that the more prominent name for the second movie was ""Robot Wars.""So, if you want the other one, (In my opinion, the better one,)Crash And Burn/Robot Wars (Double Feature)It's not as good as the ""Ice Pirates"" Amazon seems to be pushing in their twofer selection, but it's a great way to spend a couple of ""Escape"" hours.The Ice Pirates"
3,All I have to say is WOW,"This was a childhood favorite for me. I desperately searched for this movie on multiple occasions and could never find out what it was called. FINALLY, after years I found it and purchased it. Through it in my DVD player and wondered what exactly it was that I LOVED about this movie as a child... It's one of those movies that is so bad that it's good. I can't quite describe it any other way. This one is right up there with Starship troopers, etc."
3,Just like I remembered it.,"I saw this on TV many years ago, maybe 20 years ago or more. I had it on VHS and it went out the door when our last VHS player bit the dust, whenever that was. Something reminded me of it and I searched everywhere for it and finally found it on Amazon.com, of course. It is cheesy but it is a good start to the robotic revolution in movies just like Sledgehammer by George Michael(?) was for music videos. I watched it a couple of times for fun and still enjoyed it."
4,haha,"This movie is just screaming for a commentary by Joel, Crow, and Tom Servo. Gotta love its B rated cheesyness."
1,A Stupid Movie,"I recall reading an article about the director's vision for this movie. He (the director) recalled a model kit from his youth. Mostly he recalled the painting on the box, a painting of giant building-sized robots being tended to by seemingly tiny humans...it's a shame he didn't forget this image...There is nothing redeeming about this inane waste of mortal effort. The special effects stink, the story is lost early on, and any semblence of acting is glossed over by directing so childlike that we assume that the robots argued with cast over screen time, and won.This move actually makes the Sci-Fi Channel's Battle Star Galact-a-thon seem like a good idea. Unlike the original Dune, which I rerent periodically to reassure myself it is still terrible, I will never need to check back to be sure this movie is a disaster."
4,Campy fun at it's best,"""War has been outlawed"" are the first words you hear as the camera slowly makes it's way through a snow covered battlefield. Meanwhile anyone past the age of 15 is thinking, ""How the heck do you enforce that?"" If you take this movie seriously, I fear for your children. This is a perfect example of a guilty pleasure movie if I ever saw one. Stop motion special effects, glossy form fitting spandex jumpsuits and over the top characters. It's all here!!! Adults will be howling and kids will be entertained. The stand out is Paul Koslo as the evil Russian, Alexander. He won me over with the furrowed brow, dead stare and exclamations such as ""All right!! Now I Kill You!!""This is definite Genre fun. If you liked Spacehunter, Ice Pirates, Battle Beyond the Stars and Mega Force then you know what I'm talking about. I recommend the said above as well. ""Crash and Burn"" Baby! Enjoy."
4,Meca madness,"I'd have to start with a contraction since that's what I'm reminded of seems to be a movie spin off of some 70's and 80's cartoon legends such as Voltron and Robotech (Macross, for the new generation). Over all Great fights, good fxs for early 90's release, a couple familar faces and good story line to run with. Hope you like it as much as I."
4,"So campy, its fun to watch","I remember seeing this at a video rental store, and remembering it being advertised on television and in different magazines. From the box art (different from the box art shown here in Amazon - there were two robots facing off), I just had that feeling that it was going to be good.Was I ever wrong!This film is so campy, so over the top, it reminds me of other movies in the same vein (Wing Commander for instance). These are great to watch just for the sheer cheap entertainment value, but don't blame me if you feel a tinge of regret in enjoying Robot Jox."
5,PB and JAM makes a great children's gift,"I've given a dozen (or more) ""Peanut Butter and JAM"" cd's as gifts and am still counting. It's full of silly, happy, and soulful songs that'll keep little toes a-tappin'.....yours too. And when I babysit, playing this cd is the one thing that puts the kids in a good mood and keeps the TV off without any complaints. Songwriter-Singer-Musician Charity Kahn and a group of amazing musicians have compiled a true delight for ears of all ages."
5,The kids love this one.,"We have most of the Jam band CDs, the kids love them, even the 11 year old who is too cool for most of the rest of the kiddy music we have."
1,Very disappointed,"I own a few other Grizzly tools that I'm happy with, but this scroll saw is horrible. The blade doesn't travel straight up and down, and there is no way to adjust the blade. To be honest, this makes the saw practically useless. I regret buying this tool."
4,Well worth it but a caution...,"While certainly not ""Complete"" (it's about 1/3 on guitar construction, amps, effects, etc, and the other 2/3 on various genres of playing styles) it is certainly well worth the low price that it can be found for. Perhaps a studio musician will not learn anything new from this book, but other folks - even professionals - will find worthwhile tidbits on styles of playing that they were perhaps not familiar with. But a big CAUTION! I purchased a copy from the bargain bin of a well known bookseller (cough - Borders - cough) and it is fraught with many, many typos and layout errors. I suspect that no one bothered to proof-read it before it was released. My copy was printed in Singapore in 2009. Hmmmm... Still, all and all, it is an attractively produced book (lots of mouth-watering guitars in it) with tons of info. I like it!"
5,"Honestly, a COMPLETE guitar guide!","I've been playing guitar for about 8 years...and I still can say this book is great, because usually a player only focus on..duh! playing...this book covers...guitars (in ALL aspect), amps etc...manteinance, (wiring etc...) a lot of stuff that you would not learn just by yourself...TIPS, TRICKS etc...also a huge section of how to play different music genres...from Salsa to METAL, (truly metal) not as most books...this book keeps your mind fresh...from the easy to the more complicated stuff...I recommend this one!"
3,Another Guitar book,"For whatever reason I could not follow or finish this book. The size and layout are factors against it and it is now a table book to flip through vs, something to study and learn from."
3,Not Worth It,"My 2 1/2 year old son eats, sleeps, and breathes The Wiggles, so we got this for him. I was dissapointed with it from the get go and after a few days even my son got bored with it. All it does is play a very short, and I mean SHORT diddy from the Big Red Car song and runs 12 feet or so. To me it wasn't worth the money for what little it does. If it played different tunes then maybe my son would enjoy it more. We also got him the guitar which he totes around with him every where he goes, now THAT was well worth the money!"
4,Good Toy for BIG Wiggles fans,"Be shure to get more AA batteres. It needs a lot of juice. My son who just turned 3 loves it. I think it would be fine for a kid of 2 years or older. There are no parts that are too small and it puts up w/ a lot of bumps and crashes. Wish I had found it befor now. He plays w/ it w/ all of his other cars as well. Anther plus is it has an off switch so if your tired of listening to them sing you can turn it off and your kid can still ""drive"" it around and play."
5,My kids love this,We are having a lot of fun with this one. It even survived the bath. My 9 month old giggles every time it goes across the floor. IT will travel the whole length of our house. I highly recommend it.
3,My son likes it and uses it almost every day,"He is a Wiggle fan and loves the BRC, and loves the song it plays. It goes further than some of his other motorized cars. Its cute and plays part of the song, the whole song would probably be too much. i only wish it played other BRC songs."
2,A dangerous toy,"Our son got this as a gift when he was 15 months old. He loves the wiggles and really loved the toy. The problem with it is that when the guys are pressed, they move up and down to the music as the car rolls. My son got his finger caught between the car and one of the guys elbows as they moved down. It mashed his finger pretty badly and I could not get the guys to move up to free him, even when I turned it off. I finally just had to yank his finger free. I took the batteries out after that. Without the batteries, it does not roll well. Not a good toy."
3,Great...At First,"Sept 1, 2004 :My son loves this toy and plays with it every day. We haven't even had it a full month and its already broken! It says toot toot then it starts stuttering and the car stops moving. Also batteries had to be replaced already!Update: 2 more broken ones since then."
1,"Cute Toy, Song Could Be Longer","This toy is cute. Push the wiggles down and they drive across the floor (pretty far too)It is an adorable toy and my son loves it. If you are buying it for the music, save your money. This toy only plays a teensy piece of 1 song."
3,Cute...But...,"I was very disappointed with the length of the song. I would have thought it would sing a little more and that the car would drive a little longer. My 18 m/o son seems to like it, although, I can tell from his expression he expects the song to be longer, too.Overall, thumbs up."
4,The little ones can't get enough of the Wiggles car,"My twin nephews got this car for Christmas, and my other nephew couldn't keep away from it so we bought it for his January birthday. It isn't very durable (little one's don't know not to hold onto it while the wheels are spinning and the motor burns out), but the car stays intact and they still love to play with it. It was well worth the money for the enjoyment they got out of it."
3,Easy toy,"All you've got to do is push the Wiggle's down in their car and watch them go. I was hesistant to buy this for my son because it didn't seem like it does anything else but move a few feet and sing one line. But for a Wiggle's fan, he seemed to enjoy playing with this toy even though it's not his favorite. It goes pretty fast and far but just doesn't seem like it drives for long. It says in the description that it rolls for 10 seconds but I think it rolls for more like 5 seconds and then stops. It seems my son gets tired of chasing it every few seconds to make it go again. I wouldn't recommend this unless you're desperate for a Wiggle's toy. (There aren't that many to choose from)"
4,Take out a loan for batteries,"This toy is cute and my son loves it, but it EATS batteries, especially if it's used on carpet. I will put batteries in the morning and my that night, they are almost dead. Seriously.It's also kind of annoying because it only plays one song, but that's the whole point of the Big Red Car, huh? The Wiggles Guitar is much less likely to drive you insane."
5,Great toy for tots,My 21 month old son Joseph loves to play with the Wiggles Car.He pushes the men down and they just run all around. He dances and sings along with the song. He loves the Wiggles.
1,Disappointment,"I am sorry to say that I cannot give this item a good review as I never received it. I sent an e-mail trying to get in contact with someone about it, but I haven't heard back. I have paid for the item, as I have a copy of the receipt from on-line. It was suppose to be a birthday gift.I would appreciate it, if this could be remedied.Sincerely,Robyn Nantze"
2,"Teeny Little Bottle, Decent Hand Cream","I was definitely expecting something MUCH larger. The bottle is no bigger than my index finger, about 3 inches tall. I admit...I'm guilty of not paying attention to the ""1.7oz"" measurement given in the product description. Still, for $15 I am disappointed.The cream itself is fairly decent. Unlike many lotions & creams, you actually feel that your skin has absorbed some the product. Yet, I don't like the slick texture of my hands after applying the cream. It doesn't leave your hands as greasy as other lotions may, but it still leaves a noticeable coat that I find unpleasant. The fragrance, though, isn't too overbearing.I would not by this item again. It didn't make enough of an impression to be worth it."
3,terrible technical support & false claims,"Having used sequential versions of MyDeluxeMailList & Address Book over more than ten years, I continue to use it, but not without misgivings.The bulk-mail presort feature is essential and few other affordable software options exist.Despite excellent reviews, My Software fails to live up to many of their product claims.I've installed version 6.000 on two computers, XP and Win98 platforms. The ""Quick Zip+4 Lookup"" Key Feature doesn't work.On the packaging is a statement ""If you have purchased this CD within the last 90 cays call for a free update"" (to the address database USPS yearly update). The caller is given no option to request this update when calling that number. Nor is there any option available on the website for requesting this update, or even sending a message to technical support about it.Test every function you need when you install this product and if those functions don't work, return the product immediately."
2,Overuses CPU,"It's a great program with a lot of flexibility but it overtaxes the CPU. After loading the program, try CTRL-ALT-DEL. You'll find it's utilizing most of the CPU. It overheats the CPU if you have more than a program or two running. When I use the program, I have to load it, look up or do what I want and then close it or I get warning messages about the CPU overheating."
1,Old versions were much better,"We've been using Caldendar Creator for many years and because of a computer upgrade had to go to the newest version. It leaves a great deal of white space because you are forced to have each event either boxed or bannered. I called the company to see if I was missing something that I could change to decrease the white space so the print will get larger and the person on tech support was rude. I hope they lose that feature in the next version. In the meantime, I am trying to find an old computer to install the old version on."
1,DON'T BUY IT,"Picked it up as an impulse buy at Staples.EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING to use. Almost works. Date entry fields are way messed up. Can't correctly set date range to print. Can't set Event dates in a reasonable fashion.CCv8 is a POS. As much as it pains me to say it, I must recommend that people use MS Outlook instead..."
1,worthless,"This cart is complete garbage. Most of the holes were not even or smooth. Took several hours to put together, imagine a giant wooden jigsaw puzzle with cruddy holes and cheap screws. Once it was finally together it was too wobbly to hold up a microwave. I believe it is a complete waste of time and money. If I had it to do again I would just buy a cheap metal cart and been done in a half hour. The quality control sucks, I will not be buying from this company again."
2,winsome wood storage cart,"when we took it out of the box, both peices for the back and for the drawer were broken on one end. we had to glue the back one together, and since we figured we wouldn't use the drawer for anything, we left that one alone. also when we put the front together, one of the doors was too high and wouldn't close. my husband had to drill new holes for the hinges so that the door would close right.."
3,Factory defects hurt,"Pros: Solid wood, reasonably priced, relatively easy to put together.Cons: Factory defects. The left door had a four-inch hairline crack, and there was another, shorter one in a side panel. These were not caused by shipping. The lower hinge on the left door was improperly installed and was bent, with the screw not sitting flush. The door does not close properly. There are two braces installed on the lower side of the top; one was 1/2"" too long. This meant the top could only be screwed down on one side (holes did not align), and the side panel/back could not be tightened completely to make it square. All these matters could have been solved if I was a woodworker, but if I was a woodworker, I'd have built my own cart.However: I ordered this for a strictly utilitarian purpose, so will keep it. But I'd hesitate to order anything else made by this company."
5,Good Quality,"This is NOT the cheap particle-board stuff you think it is. This is a sturdy well-built cart. This beats everything I looked at locally (WalMart, Target, etc) and the price is comparable. Do not be misled by the reasonable price."
4,Great Value,"I purchased this cart for my 1.5 cubic foot microwave and it fits perfectly on top.It is of solid wood construction and looks great in the kitchen. The two shelves on the bottom provide great storage for all the microwaveable accessories I use. Two of the swivel wheels are easily lockable so the cart remains stable. The instructions for assembly were easy to follow and understand. You will find that the top draw glides on wooden rails rather than ball bearing type slides found on most kitchen cabinets, and the cabinet shelves are lattice type so the lower shelf is open to the bottom of the cabinet. I did see the same cart on other sites for double the price so to me this was a great deal."
4,Great Cart!,"I live in a very small apartment and needed more space for my appliances. I decided to try this cart out. It looks great and is so functional. It is actually a blonde wood in person, not as dark as the picture (which was a pleasant surprise!). It keeps my dining area neat because the doors hide all my smaller appliances. It took my dad 1.5 hours to put together. At first, the doors would not shut. Based on his reading of other reviews on this site, he knew to loosen the hinge on one of the doors. It was a quick-fix and the doors shut perfectly now. The only negative is that I think that it may be wider than the dimensions provided, due to the towel rack that juts out on one side. I don't know if I originally mis-measured, but the cart would not fit into the corner that I bought it for."
3,"Functional & Sturdy, but has a few flaws :(","I love our new cart, but thought others should know my experience with it. First off, it would've been nice for the pieces to be labled ""A"" ""B"" etc. to correlate with the instructions. Second, the drawer fits a bit tight to where it rubs on the top of the little counter. Last, the cabinet doors shut nicely except theres a little crack and/or space inbetween so the doors do not come together snug in the middle."
3,"Four stars for product, reduced for assembly","Overall this is a good product for the cost. I only have two problems with the quality. First there is a small black mark on the top under the finish. It looks like a pen mark about 2 inches long. No big deal, it will be covered in marks soon enough. Second, the drawer sticks. Maybe a little wax and some use will fix that.But, the assembly was a major PITA. First of all, nothing is labeled. You just have to look at the drawings and compare. The assembly will be a lot easier (and kinder on your hands) if you have a good hex driver to replace the tiny one that comes with the unit. Also, a phillips driver with a good handle is nice. It's quite a chore to get all those screws in. The back panel (slightly warped) was hard to get in the slots as well. I had to go back and loosen the rails, put the panel in, and then re-tighten."
3,"OK product, quick shipping","The outside is real wood and it's heavy. The drawer bottom is just pressed board. OK piece of furniture but keep in mind the measurements are the outside dimensions, wasn't quite big enough for what I needed. Found a good use for it anyway."
4,"Winsome Wood Single Drawer Storage Cart, Natural","Its a nice cart for the money but the drawer doesn't fit right, so going to ask company for 2 sides to the drawer. It slides in but gets tight just before closing it about 6 inches and its hard to shut."
4,"Great Cart; Assembly Fun, but Needs Caution","Bought on sale, maybe best value purchase ever made. Assembled cart looks great, very sturdy, works great; is perfect for me; I expect it to last many years. During assembly, pilot holes are too small, need to enlarge slightly w/drill, otherwise may strip hex bolts, and/or wring head off Phillips screws. Instructions a little vague on 4 very similar pieces (2 in front, above & below doors, and 2 in back, above & below back panel). Have to be matched correctly. That done, holes line up properly, assembly is easy and fun. All wood, except side, back panels and drawer bottom are lanimated masonite type material. That's okay with me. I really like this cart."
4,Assembly Required !,"Otherwise would have been a 5 star. The assembly instructions require very close scrutiny while putting together. It would be very easy to confuse panels. But once sides are sorted out and you choose a partner to assist you....you are off to a beautiful piece of furniture. I am happy with the sturdiness and impressed by the spacious storage area it provides. Just pay attention to the pictures to avoid any pitfalls. Denise Y., Fraser, MI"
3,Sturdy but Poorly Cut,"While the unit was easily assembled, the back section was not cut properly. The unit is in my kitchen, holding up my microwave, but when I was putting it together, I discovered the back would not go on. The pegs were in the wrong place. Very sloppy."
4,How to Assemble the cart!,Purchased today and gave it 4 stars based on the price.You can get the instruction/assembly manual for it at Home Depot under more information.Just Google Internet # 202015166 and you can review them.Will add more after I receive it and assemble it.
1,Rolling Kitchen Storage,"Again, you get what you pay for. The doors don't line up properly. When I pulled on one of the doors the handle snapped off. The drawer doesn't line up as well. The drawer won't pull out (what good is it). Luckily I have a handy husband who can fix things."
5,NIce product,"Arrived promptly. Easy to put together, pretty sturdy, good price. Great to use in a small apartment or in a dorm"
4,Strong Real wood furniture,This is a strong real wood furniture at an excellent price. Assembly was simple and took less than 30 minutes. The racks inside are also strong and can hold heavy items. I gave it a 4 star as it has a slight problem with the door closing. One of the door does not close properly for the magnet inside to hold it closed. This seems to be due to a slight misalignment of the door. You have close it slowly for the magnet to hold it closed. Other than this the cart is excellent.
3,Microwave cabinet,I was disappointed with the quality. One of the pieces was missing and on of the door handles was badly chipped. From the reviews I had read I really thought I would be receiving a much higher quality cart. The left door does not close all the way giving the cart a less than perfect look. It is functional. Cathy Adamescu
4,good value,"the cabinet is mostly solid wood- no MDF. similarly priced big box store products would be made entirely of particle board. a big plus here, as particle board is not durable at all. For the price paid, this cabinet is a very good value. Don't expect ball bearing drawer slides, though. the drawer slides on a couple of cheesy stapled in-place wood runners. the drawer fits very loosely into its slot, so feels a little cheap, but again, for the price paid this is acceptable.I assembled it in about 2 hours with my 4 year old and a little help from my 2 year old. the instructions were pretty good- slightly clearer than Ikea, but similar. If you have assembled furniture from Ikea or others, assembly will be no problem. If not, look into what you are getting into- it is definitely more than sliding a drawer into its slot!"
5,This is a great item,"This was exactly what I needed for the awkward corner in my small, storage-challenged kitchen. The microwave sits on top, my kitchen towels and magnetic fridge lists are in the drawer, and all my Tupperware is in the cabinet. And unlike many wheels that are supposed to lock, these actually DO lock in place. My only complaint is the towel rack - you don't have an option on which side to place it. It's predrilled for the right side, which didn't work for my placement so I opted to leave it off. I could have had my husband drill holes in the other side, but then it wouldn't have been me putting it together on my own hehehe... Otherwise it was super easy to assemble, and all actual wood. Looks really good too!OH - the two shelves inside the cabinet doors are slats, not solid wood. Totally fine with that for my purposes, but I don't remember seeing that in the description."
3,Like it but some damage parts upon opening...,Seems to be good quality material for the most part. Like the look and feel of it. Only problem was the drawer guide was crushed and in pieces upon opening. Getting a replacement.
3,An average product,"On delivery we found that one of the rails that the drawer slides on had been split out at the factory by the nailing process.The guy that did it knew it and he just packed it in the box anyway.Not worth returning so we clamped it with out woodworking clamps and glued it with wood glue.The drawer just slides on the rails and you should put some wax on them to make it move a little better.Old fashioned yes, but it works."
3,"nice looking, hard to assemble","The Winsome storage cart was just what I was looking for. It was difficult finding a cart that would accomodate my large countertop microwave oven, but the Winsome cart was perfect. HOWEVER, assembly was difficult because of the hard to understand instructions. No words, just pictures. Also a couple of pieces were improperly prepared and would not line up properly. A bit of improvisation was necessary. Assembly was also labor-intensive. I think that the ability to read and understand diagrams, and the ability to improvise poorly matched parts is a must in assembling this product. However, once it is assembles and in use, it is a beautiful and useful product."
5,Well Built,"This cart is as substantial as it appears. It's very sturdy and well finished, and I didn't have any difficulty assembling it. All in all, a well made product."
1,very disappointing,I am a non-professional designer who was expecting to learn something new from this book. I didn't. It's like a children's book. See blue? Can you think of anything that is blue? Water is blue. Water is cool.... I'm seeing red after spending $ on this item.
3,graphic design,Good content - terrible graphic design of this book. The book designers should leave this profession.
1,wrong info,"I found that the definition of tertiary colors on the 10th page of the book is wrong. As tertiary colors are a combination of primary and secondary colors, and not a combination of secondary colors only as the book has mentioned."
4,Great color combinations,"I bought this book because I wanted to venture off into different color schemes. I found myself stuck using the same colors in a lot of my work. This book broadened my horizons, many color combinations and the author tells you how each color is portrayed by the human psyche. I just wish the author had all the Pantone colors in this book!"
4,Great starting point,"This book is a great place to start when you've jumped into a project and have no idea of what direction you're going to go with color.With a color guide broken down by 'moods' (e.g., blue: dependable, cool; green: refreshing, healing), you can pan through the book and start brainstorming in your mind of what directions to go.You then get into the display listing of colors broken down by moods such as: mellow, serene, spiritual.One of the great features of the book is the color conversion appendix which correlates each Pantone color to it's CMYK equivalent. This is priceless when you're preparing a process color job for press.Certainly not the be-all-and-end-all of color books, but a great resource to have on your desk!"
5,FABULOUS REFERENCE BOOK,"I bought this book as a reference guide for a Certificate course I am taking in Interior Design - The section of the course was entitled LANGUAGE OF COLOR and having this book as a reference guide, was immensely helpful, both to myself and sharing it with my fellow colleagues.Ms. Eisemen's explanation with a plethora of colorful illustrations was top-notch, well written and explicit in design and theory. All together an impressive body of work and an ideal tool for any designer to have for inspiration and understanding."
3,So-So but Loses Pieces Quick!,"My 4yr old really loves being able to put her Barbies in the convertible and race them around the hardwood floors. Unfortunately my 2yr old loved the fact that she could remove the windshield AND the seats.... so now my 4yr old has to drive her high class Barbies around in a seatless, winshieldless wonder on wheels. Not sure why the pieces were able to come off so easily but **shrug** that's the way it goes. Anyone who has small children KNOWS what happens to small parts and pieces once they are dismembered from their larger ""mother ship"" LOL Not sure we'll ever find the seats or the windshield!"
3,Don't expect too much...,"I bought this for my 4 1/2-year-old last Christmas. At first she was really excited about it. Then she tried to put her Barbies in the seats. The seatbelts are difficult to actually use on the dolls. Then she turned a corner around the couch and the outside mirror snapped off. They are made so that they can fold inward, but the hinge part just broke instead. She still plays with it occasionally, but it's just not the quality I expected."
1,A ford ?????,A ford since when has barbie started name her cars? Atleast bratz dont go calling their cars names you can pretend to call the bratz cars anything like maybe a HOLDEN?
3,It does what it says but....,"I bought this lens for a Nikon D50 SLR using a 19-35mm Tokina lens. I'd seen an on-line test using exactly the same combination so I thought I was getting a bargain---15mm on the wide end. The lens works, but in several of my pictures, pretty much any outside with bright light, the edges are horribly distorted and blurred. Indoor shots were somewhat more acceptable. Sure, I could just crop them, but that defeats the purpose of the wide angle in the first place. I tried it also on my Minolta a200 and got the same results. I don't know if my cameras and the adapter were a bad fit; after all it is made just for the E10, but I wasn't happy with it."
5,Country classics by the original singers,These recordings have excellent sound. Time-Life made many county CDs spanning different decades and time periods. I remember listening to these songs and really enjoying them. Many of the songs are now considered classics but they were also early in the careers of these legends. It was great to get these on a single CD.
3,Great Starter Skates after some modifications!,"The skates are great for learning, however the straps are something to be desired. I removed the starps and made some of my own after a quick trip to REI for some nylon webbing and some buckle fasteners. Now the fit my boys feet snuggly and he really loves to get out skating. It's amazing how many people come up to us and ask about the skates as they don't seem to be as easily available anymore."
4,Just the ticket for a toddler who wants to skate!,"Very easy to put on and take off. These skates are excellent for a toddler who's just learning to skate. They're holding up well, aside form one of the adjustment bolts falling off. Honestly, this could have been our mistake and it was easy to find a replacement part. We'd gladly buy these for our next child, too. Very nice product that has very much satisfied our expectations."
3,Overpriced,Wing nut needs tightening. Leather straps needed additional holes for 3 year old's boots. Replaced leather with nylon straps from EMS.
1,Buckle will break.,"This product was fine for a while, but then the buckle broke. I contacted the seller many times asking if there was something I could do, a buckle replacement I could buy perhaps. I never got a response. I had to get a computer wire cord things to keep the blades on his feet. Even after that, the blades would slip off my 2yr old's feet over and over and have to be re-attached. We kept on having to go out on the ice rink over and over. People kept on asking me where I got the skates, and at first I told them. After the seller was ignoring me, I stopped telling them. So, the seller lost a lot of sales. These will last for only a few times, then they will break."
3,Do the fans blow up or down?????,"It's hard to believe, but the most basic information is simply not available on the mfr site or review sites. Dell and many other laptops have air intakes on the bottom, so they suck air from below and expel (blow) hot air from the back. Therefore they are not compatible with laptop cooling stands that suck air from the top. The cooler MUST blow air upward to work with my Dell or the laptop will get even hotter!!!"
2,Interesting but not all that.,"Interesting book. Had an interesting perspective, but it was not the grand and iconoclastic book most reviewers seem to presnt it."
1,Academic history,This is a reasonably well-written history of the conquest of Mexico and other Latin countries. His points are belabored and not in my opinion not of general interest.
5,Restall debunks historical myths.,"This book is brilliant.I attended a seminar where we were lucky enough to read Restall's book before it was published. Our mission was to try and debunk at least one of Restall's seven myths. Mission Failure! We found little success. His thesis is tight, his evidence is sound, and is book is great."
5,excellent book.,"it opens your eyes about our modern history like not other book. if you are interested on colonialism, this a key book."
2,Pricing error?,"This show's great-- I intend to buy the complete Big Love boxset whenever it finally lands on Amazon, but I was considering buying the first 3 seasons in the meantime.However-- buying each season individually brand new from Amazon totals to $86, and they're charging nearly double that for the three together. How does that make sense?"
5,Great Book.,"I have known for some time that the Catholic Dogma was in error, and manmade, but this explained a lot that I didn't know.Thank you!"
5,"Zeb, are you there?","Zeb, old buddy, old pal, I've been trying to track you down for years and just can't quite get there. It's McClintock from back in the day. I swear at least twice a year your name comes up because you are the only one to have video taped the ""Emu Inncedent"" with Dibble and Nips. Anyway, if you get this posting look me up either through the Cornell site or Myspace. I've gotta get my hands on a copy of that video. Hope you're doing well, man. Later."
1,should be called CodeWarrior Palm Programming,"Another book that pushes the ""drag and drop"" programming.Barely mentions the GNU development environment which is used by most programmers now"
2,Buy the Palm OS Programming Bible instead,"This was the first book I bought on Palm OS programming and I wish it had not been. On the plus side it does a good job of explaining the basics of Codewarrior and it includes some good basic examples of programs.On the minus side the examples do not compile on the included Codewarrior Lite. They do not even compile on the standard Codewarrior without a fair bit of massaging.Overall I found using this book to learn Palm OS programming to be very frustrating. Between this book, the Codewarrior Tutorials, and trail and error I did eventually learn to write Palm OS programs.Since then I have acquired a copy of the ""Palm OS Programming Bible"". All I can say is the ""Bible"" is more than worth the extra [price] in terms of technical accuracy and in depth coverage of topics."
1,There are better books!,"I would not buy this book because: (1) to fill the book complete listings are printed. (2) where you expect a small listing to illustrate some text you won't find any. (3) the examples are trivial, only cover the most superficial topics. (4) there are better books out there (O'Reillys and the Dummies)."
1,What works here?,"The author happily writes code for CodeWarrior, yet includes CodeWarrior Lite on the CD. The two SDK are different and there is no help on CodeWarrior Lite. In addition, you can not compile any code with the Lite version."
2,My fears were realised,"The book started out great, especially for free gcc users, and then it started leaning onto codewarrior, with much of the sample codes (and I hated the coding style :P) and screenshots referring to projects created in it. GCC users, a better book would have to be the one by O'Reilly."
4,Very useful for all but the very advanced,This book is good for the beginner/intermediate Arcview user who wants to brush up on the finer details of map production and design. I like the attitude of the authors in that they are willing to point out the deficiencies of the Arcview software while at the same time suggesting a wide variety of 3rd party extensions to make it more useful. The writing style is lucid and not overly technical and I could imagine myself performing the functions they describe without having to go to my computer. What I would like to see however - especially for the ...asking price - is a full color text as this is the only way to communicate much of what the author is trying to convey. Still this is the only book I know of that deals specifically with ESRI software for the purpose of cartographic design and my wish is that they produce another volume for the new ArcGIS software.
4,Very useful book,This book is very useful for someone looking to enhance their arc maps beyond the standard design.
4,Don't be too scared of the thickness.,"Though it looks fat, the book is nicely made. With dates, timelines, and good specifics. It has a lot of information and seemlessly connects from one era to another. It picks up on a lot of the events and covers over most of the important details that many people miss.It's a good buy. Worth the money."
5,Great Review Book,"The REA AP US History review was the book that I used to review for the AP test today. It's very detailed and goes over all the event that are covered in the textbook we used in class but in a more succinct manner.I also read the Princeton Review but I felt that it was too general and when I took practice tests, I was unable to answer the more specific questions. The REA book covers each topic more in depth than the Princeton Review does and at the end of each chapter there is a helpful time line for remembering certain time periods.While I did not take the practice tests in this book, I skimmed over a few questions and I would not recommend relying on this book for practice because the questions are too easy and of a lower caliber than is tested on the AP.But overall, this book definitely helped me cover and review all the topics I needed to know for this exam. I just got my scores, and I got a 5, because of this book. I would definitely recommend this book to everyone."
4,It definitely helped!,My daughter used this for her AP US History exam and had been struggling somewhat in the class (tough teacher!). She felt this was fairly concise and helpful. Passed the exam - so no complaints!!
1,Went from awesome to terrible recently,"I used to be an ardent fan of Parle-G. There was a whole shelf in our kitchen dedicated to PG packets. However, they recently changed something in their recipe - the new biscuits look different, are slighly thicker and less dense, taste quite different (and slightly burnt, I must say) as compared to the old ones. The packet cover has changed ever so slightly, so thankfully, I can tell if a retailer has the old style or the new style cookies. Unfortunately, no one in the bay area has the old style any more, so no more P-G for me. I'm not sure why they had to mess with something that was working so well for them. Maybe in their opinion (and in that of the focus group that they worked with) the new ones are better. However, I and a few of my friends agree that it's time to re-allocate that shelf space in my kitchen to other snacks. Britannia Bourbons, maybe?"
3,TRULY HARD TO UNDERSTAND,THERE ARE SOME PARTS OF THIS BOOK I FIND SPECTACULAR. I MEAN THAT HAVE ALTERED MY LIFE BUT THE MAJORITY OF IT IS SO INCREDIBLY HARD TO FOLLOW. I HAD TO READ SOME PARAGRAPHS 3 TIMES AND STILL DIDN'T UNDERSTAND IT AND I'M AN EDUCATOR!!! THE TERMINOLOGY IS DIFFICULT AND THERE ARE WORDS IN THERE THAT I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF. THE MEANING BEHIND THE BOOK IS WONDERFUL AND I SIMPLY WISH I COULD COMPREHEND IT ALL :-(.
1,"Brutally noisy, but with a catch.","I returned this air purifier within 18 hours of purchasing it. Even on it's lowest setting the amount of air noise this thing generates is unbearable, especially in a 900 square foot apartment.Wait, there's more. On top of the stardard and expected noise of moving air, there's a vibrating plastic noise as well. It sounded as it the fans were not properly balanced and thus created an unavoidable and unfixable vibration. However, this might have just been my particular unit.I did run it for about 3 hours in my bedroom (with the door closed because of the noise) and when I went to bed I noticed a slight change in alergies, but due to the fact that I couldn't run it in the room while I slept, I still woke up with a stuffy nose, and itchy red eyes...Don't buy this product if you enjoy watching tv in your living room, or sleeping in your bedroom."
1,DON'T BUY!,"Why buy an air purifier with 'permanent' air filters that have to be replaced if they get fouled? The filter CAN'T be washed! Although the unit functions well, this is a marketing sleight of hand to say they're 'permanent' yet must be REPLACED if they encounter 'smoke or other sticky particles'. Yes, I found this out to my shagrin. Your best bet would be to purchase a HFD-120 with washable filters!"
4,Happy with ours,"We have owned one of these air purifiers for over a year & it's still going strong. One reviewer mentioned that the permanent filters can't be washed, but I've washed mine several times & though the filters do become discolored they clean easily & still function well. The noise isn't a issue for us since we keep the unit in a hallway to help filter air from the TV room & in the hallway. We keep the unit running 24/7, set it to low speed at times when the areas of the house we use it for aren't in use & then set the speed higher when it's needed. We are both smokers, have several pets & so far this unit has kept up with what we need it for. I didn't give it a 5th star because of one unpleasant feature. The back cover that has to be removed to clean the filters is hard to get off because the snap latch for it is too close to the housing of the unit to depress it properly by hand. We have to use a wide, flat head screw driver to hold the snap latch down to get it to release."
2,Too noisy even on lowest setting,"This review is unfortunately incomplete, since the unit was so noisy to me (even on the lowest setting) that I ended up returning it to the store within a few hours.The unit seemed to have all the features I was looking for, I'm going to try another (different) Honeywell model with similiar features in the store and see what the noise level is."
3,works great but consumes energy,I love how this fan cleans my air but I don't love how my power bill sky rocketed.
1,Worst of the worst,"This book reads like it was written by an egotistical 14 year old. Not just badly written but this person obviously thinks of themself as funnier than the icons who are honoured and repeatedly puts the event & the people involved down, while proffering their opinion about in every sentence.You will regret buying this book."
5,Lots of features for the price.,These paddles are great! I really like the padded handles which are great for longer treks. You cannot find a better paddle for the price.
2,too short for anybody,"This would be a nice kayak paddle, but it has one serious flaw: it is too short. No matter how you paddle, the airborne blade drips water into the boat! You have to reach somewhat into the dipped side, and the blade that is in the air is over the boat, even with the drip guard all the way out to the paddle! An extension is needed that is at least one foot, and possibly two feet long. I am a long time kayaker, and this is a SHORT paddle."
4,"Comfortable, lightweight, and Sturdy","PROS:* Easy to assemble (snap the two paddles together)* Shaft made well of metal* Plastic paddlefins are thick plastic and light weight* Curved fin helps push water a little better* Good water blocking rings* Cushioned hand grips* Cheap price at $30 from amazonCONS:* Plastic may get brittle and broken if left in sun for months* Length could be about a foot longer, but it's highly manageable and not noticable by mostOverall, I highly recommend and would purchase this again. I have two for my two person kayak. Works great."
1,NOT AS ADVERTISED,"I am the second reviewer to note that this paddle is NOT AS ADVERTISED. This paddle is 84 inches long, not 92 as advertised. DO NOT ORDER THIS PADDLE unless you want an 84"" (7') paddle."
5,The spare that I use every time,"I already had a Field and Stream paddle that was given to me with my kayak. About a year ago when I got a second kayak for my son, I got this paddle from Amazon. It was about half the price of what my paddle cost at Dick's Sporting Goods, but the curved blade made it much better. A few weeks before we got the kayaks out for the year, I got another one of these on sale for a spare, and after several trips, my Field and Stream paddles have yet to leave the house."
3,Too short for a man.,"It's just 84"" paddle,not 92"" as advertised and is good for kids and women but too short for a man.Stronger the person-longer the paddle.I'm 5'11"" and 190 pounds and for me 96"" paddle is good enough."
5,"Lightweight, Functional, Easy To Use, Tote, and Store","I got these kayak paddles to go with my Sevylor Inflatable Canoe because they are lightweight, easy to use, easy to tote around, and easy to store in a storage bin of my motorhome. Why am I using kayak paddles in a canoe? So that I don't have to switch paddles back and forth and so that my husband and I don't inadvertently smack each other in the head. These are nice, functional kayak paddles and work very well with my inflatable canoe."
5,Flashback: A Brief History of Film(5th Edition),This book is great and in a great condition. I bought this used book and turn out to be a new book condition which surprise me. The price of the book is the most cheapest I can found on any of the website. This book fits the need of my classroom needs and I will definitly come back again. I will come back to this website again when I need to seel back my textbook.
1,An awkward approach in the new era of film studies.,"I do not think this book was as good as some of the other textbooks I have reviewed for use in my History of Cinema class. The one reason is that the book deals with history through an auteur approach, detailing each filmmaker. The current focus is typically a hybrid approach; using historical details, the business of film, and theory to teach the subject matter. Filmmakers are used as ways to interpret the consequences of that history. I was also surprised when a few major films were left out of the book, mostly foreign lesser known filmmakers. But how can you not discuss Rashomon when discussing Akira Kurosawa? This should not be a top choice for college level film classes."
2,Only liked a couple of songs,I thought it would have more Scooby-related songs on it. It was mostly R&B.
3,Normal Soundtrack Filler material.,"Where is ""God Only Knows""? It was in the Scrappy-doo flashback scene, but not on the disc."
4,great soundtrack,I like songs 1 and 2. Uncle kracker and Busta Rymes Freaks come out at Night is definantly the best song though.
2,Man with the Hex,"The ""You remind me of the man..."" lines that are in the song ""Man with the Hex"" were also used by David Bowie, but are from the Cary Grant & Rosalind Russell movie, ""His Girl Friday."""
1,Buy this if you like RAP music,"The movie was good. My son loves Scooby Doo. But, this CD is all RAP music. Ok for the teen/adult who adores Rap music. But, for those of us who really don't have a taste for Rap music, it's awful. What happened to traditional Scooby."
2,Unhappy,I am not pleased with my purchase of the Westclox Woodson wall clock. We have had to replace the battery twice with in a few days and the clock still looses time each day. It says it is made in China. What else can I say? I do not recommend it.NS/Olympia
5,Superb!,"Along with Roseanna and The Man on the Balcony, Murder at the Savoy easily ranks in the top three out of the ten Martin Beck series. Logical, crisp plot. Great references to the political climate of the 60's. A real pleasure."
2,"Good story, poor transfer","The plot which is typical of movies of the 30s is fun, and is worth seeing. Unfortunately the transfer by Alpha Video (oldies.com) is very poor and looks like it was transferred from a poor VHS copy. In addition to many scratches it has excessive noise with not very good resolution. The packaging is very nice and the CD plays well, but the transfer is poor. You would be better off buying a good VHS copy from Sinister Cinema."
3,Like the carmel much more,"Got this to try it out as I love their carmel flavor, but I found I didn't really care for this one. Just not much flavor to it or a sweet tasting as the caramel!"
5,Yummy Delicousness,Had this flavor at a movie theater and can not possibly live without it. Only place I could find it was Amazon. My daughter and I are hooked.
1,"Save your money, look elsewhere","The author of this book says that he only learned of the Doolittle mission a few years ago. One wonders why Viking, his publisher, the publisher of such distinguished WWII authors as Prof. Ronald Spector, commissioned this author to write on the Doolittle raid.The book is full of basic factual errors and strange assertions about combat and World War II. It tells us that American battleships were armed with torpedoes and that Mitchell B-25 bombers had diesel engines. (Both are not the case.) More importantly and even more bizarrely, it states that if the U.S. didn't win the battle at Midway, Japan's empire would still be ""intact today.""One would be better served (and informed) watching the movie ""Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo,"" which was produced with technical advisers who actually flew the mission.The author would have been too."
1,Not researched but well embellished,"I was only able to read as far as page 146 before I was turned off by the author's lack of knowlege of the subject. For instance, on the page mentioned above he quotes Lt Joyce as saying ""my rear gunner was firing."" He did record the fact that the tail guns had been removed and replaced by broom sticks. Where was his editor? Other reviewers have also pointed out other glaring errors committed all before page 146 such as diesel engins, ""Billys"", and B's taxiing, and so on. The first half of the book left much to be desired, I will not read the rest of the book."
1,First Heros,"Although this is a great subject for a book. It is one of the most poorly written books I've ever read. The authors strangely refers to the B-25 bombers as 'Billys', refers to the airmen by their nicknames which is very confusing, refers to the gunners as bubble boys which I found insulting and needs a lesson in basic aviation before he writes another book on the subject. My advice to prospective readers is to purchase any book by C.V. Glines as he is the official historian of the Doolittle Raiders."
1,inexcusably bad,"A Hundred Feet Over Hell: Flying With the Men of the 220th Recon Airplane Company Over I Corps and the DMZ, Vietnam 1968-1969It is unfortunate that the story of the Doolittle Raid was handed to a talentless writer with no knowledge of the war in the Pacific and WWII aviation. The many egregious technical and historical errors - which could fill many pages on their own - coupled with a cringe-making style make reading this book sheer torture. The publisher also bears a heavy responsibility for putting it in the hands of an editor who is clearly as ignorant of flying and aerial warfare as the author. I tried a number of times to get through ""First Heroes"", but without success. I suspect that readers who have given it more than two stars are family friends of the author; if not, they certainly have no feel for facts or what passes for good writing. Never have I bought an account of WWII that so deserved to be pulped before it ever left the publisher's warehouse."
1,Look Elsewhere,"If you are looking for a book on the Doolittle Raid, read ""Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo"" by Ted Lawson. Don't waste your time with this book.The book has many factual and grammatical errors. The names of the Japanese Leaders involved are constantly written backwards. For example, Admiral Isoroku Yamamato is written as Yamamoto Isoroku among many others.The author spends more time on Japan's preparations for the Pearl Harbor attack than he does on America's preparations for the Doolittle Raid. The book is not a page turner."
2,Informative but Virtually Unreadable,"I'll preface my review by saying that I am a big history buff, and especially love military history. And while I found the subject matter of ""The First Heroes"" to be quite compelling, the writing is so leaden that the book is virtually unreadable. I also have to quibble with the title since the heroic and doomed stand at Wake Island occurred months before the Doolittle raid was just as important as an early psychological victory in the American war against Japan. The most pertinent comment that I can make about ""The First Heores"" is that I became so bogged down by its lack of narrative force that, despite being an avid reader, I couldn't finish it."
5,"Told more of the story than ""30 Sec. over Tokyo""","Must have seen the movie ""30 Sec. Over Tokyo"" a dozen times. It was fascinating to read about all the other men involved and what happened AFTER the bombs were dropped. Must read for a WWII buff."
5,GREAT!,"This tube is great! I used it to float the river. The case helps protect the tube from rocks in shallow waters. Very durable, good quiality. I have used many floats in my day this one is by far the best quality for the cost."
2,"Good, but busted","It was what I was wanting. I had bought one like it at walmart and had it for about 5 or 6 years with no problems. We used it to pull the kids behind the 4 wheeler in the snow. It took a lot of abuse and kept on truckin'. This one got a leak the first time out and we were going slow, and just riding in our front yard (it is pretty flat). We were dissapointed since the last one held up so good, and I didn't pay but about 38-40 dollars for the first one."
2,Goes underwater,I bought this tube because of the high reviews. I have an 11 year old and 7 year old. We pull this tube with a waverunner. When going less than 10 mph the tube goes under water. Yes it is fully inflated and hooked up properly. Very disappointed about this. Seems like they didn't sew the hitch high enough on the tube cover. Very scary for little kids to go have the tube go under. Sadly disappointed in this item.
4,Bought 2 for snow use,"Bought 2 of these as they were some of the lowest cost towables. Pulled kids on them behind snowmobiles without any problem. I reccomend filling them quite full of air though, as that helps the sleeve fit best. Not sure if the one that lost some air had any kind of leak, but these help up pretty well especially with the heavy drag of snow.Will buy more Kiwk Tek's to use in snow and water."
3,"Can be fun, but it's more of a pain than it is worth","When this tube is in the water, it is very tall, making it very difficult to get on. With that said, that does give you extra cushioning for when you hit some wakes. It is also hard to stay on this tube when you are laying down on it. The front grips are just too far apart. If you plan on doing anything other than sitting in the middle and leaving yourself at the mercy of the boat driver, than this may not be the tube for you. Also, the weight limit on this tube is rated for people under 180 lbs, so if you're a big guy, just be warned.All in all, it's a decent enough tube for the price. I'll be selling mine."
4,GOOD COLLECTION!,"ITS A RALLY GOOD SELECTION OF THE BEST TATU SONGS, THE BEST ARE THE REMIXES, TEH DVD IS TOO SHORT, BUT INCLUDES ALL THE BRAND NEW VIDEOS, SO COOL!"
3,Great content but poor editing...,"I'm currently taking a Psychology class and this is our assigned text book. The content of the book is great and I have a greater understanding of Psychology now. Unfortunately, the editing of the book is poor, especially the review sections at the end of each chapter. Bottom line: the answers in the back of the book are not always correct. If you're going to be tested on the material in this book, I strongly suggest that you study the content of the chapters and NOT the answers found in the back of the book."
5,Good College Book,"Of course I didn't buy this book to read for fun, but it definitely is a decent composition book. If you are a fellow student trying to purchase ""Good Reasons: researching and writing effective arguments"", this book is EXACTLY the same for the first 300 or so pages...down to the page numbers. Additionally, if you are required to get the ""MLA Update"", don't. The only difference between this version and the other version listed and the MLA updates for both is that the ""MLA Update"" book italicizes sources that are underlined in this book. Save your money."
3,New Edition for English Contemporary Arguments..,"this book is in great condition.. it doesn't seem like there are too many differences between this edition and the 3rd edition. the book overall is just a nicer paper, and the pictures are nicer. but still sends the same message as the 3rd. glad my teacher made this new fancy book a part of the curriculum. oh well.. it'll be good for another two years."
2,Good Reasons,"I bought this book from this seller because I needed the book fast. The book was located in Illinois and I was too. I figured I would have it in less than a week. It didn't ship out for a week. I ended up waiting 18 days for a book that was located in the same state as me. The book was not in good condition as it said it was. It was in decent shape, but definitely not what I was expecting for almost full price. Very disappointed with my service from this seller. I had to beg my instructor for copies out of the text until my book showed up, almost the 4th week into the semester. I would be cautious next time with dealing with this seller."
2,Mac User,"This products stinks b/c I have a Mac. To many times do I run into this problem, but I thought the PSP software might be different."
3,Not what we expected,"Description was misleading and product was not what we expected it to be, were unable to use it as intended."
3,It works,"Not a lot to say on this software... it pretty much does what it's supposed to but it's not the easiest thing to use. Part of that is just the way Sony built the PSP to handle media. To be honest, I find using any software to import media into the PSP to be a lengthy somewhat cumbersome affair and this Media Mgr is no different. However, it DOES work and is easier than some freeware stuff I tried."
2,Not what is advertised,"I got this thinking it would be the only thing i would need for putting stuff on my PSP. I was very disappointed because it wont convert most video file formats, including some codecs of .avi which on the box it says it does. I can use it for pictures and music, but it categorizes the music in separate files according to album. So that means no mixed play lists. On the plus side the USB cable worked fine, although I already had one so I didn't need it. If you are looking something to put videos on your PSP then just download one of the free programs found all over the internet."
1,USB cable doesn't fit newer PSP models.,The USB cable that came with the Media Manager did not fit my Ceramic white PSP. It doesn't say that anywhere on the product packaging.
3,No VISTA support,"As long as you are still using Windows XP this software works fairly well and streamlines the process of adding/ moving multiple items from your PSP. It is especially help in dowloading RSS feeds. I believe this product should be included with the purchase of a PSP.WARNING: I recently got a new PC with Windows Vista and this software won't install on it. I checked Sony support web site and it indicates only that it does not ""yet"" support Vista"
3,Inconsistent errors on mpg conversions,"I get errors converting some of the mpg files captured from PC PVR. No consistency on the error, so it makes it hard to track -- it just randomly crashes. I decided to use PSP Video 9 for all my conversions, and didn't any errors converting the same files."
3,good but needs more options,i think it a great program BUT it can use more options for the price i think it can be cheper like $15.00 but what is nice you get the usb cable all so so you dont have to buy one its a simple drag and drop program that can use more options to make it more use full !!!!!
4,Tresors litteraires: Initiation a la litterature francaise et francophone (Student Edition),Okay book for beginners. Arrived quickly and in good condition.
2,rain suit,Overpiced. Poor quality. Made and sewn cheaply. Would not recomend. Many seams were mis-sewn. Frays easily.
2,A filthy & drunken blues guitar player from Buenos Aires,"Pappo is un chorroba from La Paternal, Buenos Aires. He started his career in the seventies ripping off any blues & heavy metal riff there was around, developed a panza full of vino tinto, got his voice burn from whisky Criadores, and still BB King asked to play along with him. He even dedicated a song to his mother."
3,Interesting but outdated,"This book describes the sudden ascendancy of the Russian `Fascist' Vladimir Zhironovsky. This Russian leader emerged after the fall of gorbachev and his star rose quickly. In subsequent Duma elections his right wing nationalistic party gained a good following and many in the west feared that Russia would become a right wing reactionary state. But Zhironovsky's brand of politics quickly faded and this books outdated analysis shows through. Zhironovsky was best known for a stunt in which he arrived at the Duma dressed in an army uniform, conjuring up images of Hitler, Mussulini and Franco who had done the same. Yet other scandals followed as Zhirinovsky's ties to Saddam Hussien came to light and his denial of his Jewish heritage also hurt him among his many anti-Semitic followers. In the end Zhirinovsky is an interesting personae but he is not the rising hobgoblin portrayed in this book."
3,Deals well with some basic notions. Non technical,Although the opening chapters are strong the later discussions of the applications and consequences of GR are not enlightening or explanatory
3,ITS HUGE!,"On the picture this thing might look cute and small but let me tell you, this thing is huge!! I returned it (and amazon charged me $29 for the return shipping) I later found a foldable table (lifetime brands) in costco for $49.99 and I think that's a way better buy (in stores only)"
4,Big ciffhanger!,I liked this book alot. I am very into the whole series. It resolved alot of the fighting between the covens but the introductin of alex and his explanation of himself at the end left alot to be wanting. I really really hope that there is a second book and that it awnsers all the questions the end.
2,Starts good ends terrible,Book started off good then just loses your attention. Not really good examples and author has difficulty trying to explain different router protocols. Would not recommend.
1,Did not receive,"I'm sure these are good shoe skates, but there was a mix-up at True Value & we didn't get the shoes."
2,CBEST PREP,"Dedication to the Oxford English Dictionary (aka: OED), Norman Lewis' Syntactics and Etymology, for example, as well as life-long devotion to Pythagorian Theory and Polynomials, provide undeniable essential foundations as a preparatory for the CBEST that not but one (1) or even ten (10) Study Guides can match... Lifetime devotion to diplomacy and communicative-logic skills remains foremost; not one study guide but the avid reading of many volumes of study guides that scholars recount and recommend to be critical foundations..."
1,There are much better books out there,I was taking the cbest and this book is not really a good practice for taking the cbest. I purchased another book on it and have now passed the test. This book is too broad and really doesn't cover the information needed for this test. The examples given in this book are not very clear on the steps for the math section. Get the book cracking the cbest that was a great book
5,Cliffy,"Very good book to use for the test. I pass two sections, not the writing part. Please, when studying, try to practice on the fractions. That is the main part of math."
2,"Sloppy work, full of errors","I really can't recommend this book, since there are so many errors in it. Test preparation guides should really be much more circumspect about printing errors."
4,It helped me pass the first time,"I hadn't taken a test in years, and I bought this book to help me study. The only problem was that it had some minor typos, which made me think I got some of the problems in the practice test wrong, when indeed I didn't. But that was a minor problem.Great study guide."
5,Perfectly detailed and helpful,"I just took (and passed!) the CBEST exam, and had purchased several books as study guides to prepare. CBEST Cliffs Test Prep had just the right amount of helpful, useful info without being overwhelming. The detailed explainations of problems I'd missed when taking the practice tests provided in the book were incredibly concise and proved invaluable on the actual test. Great study guide - I'd highly recommend it to anyone preparing for the test!"
4,Good resource for math prep!,"If you want to pass the math section in particular, the Cliffs CBEST prep is excellent to give you a quick, clear, and concise review of all the formulas and math concepts that you've forgotten over the years. The practice tests are very close to the actual test. You should couple this resource with the math practice tests on the CBEST website, which are closest to what is really on the test. I passed the CBEST the first time focusing on these two resources only days before the test (I had become so frustrated with Kaplan's confusing math review. Do not buy that book to review for the math section, is it WAY TOO in depth and covers things you do not need to know! And yes, geometry is NOT on the test!) I hope this helps all of my fellow aspiring teachers out there, especially those who are as bad in math as I am. Good luck!"
3,Only used it for the Exams,If you need practice on the Exams use this book! It offers four of them! The only thing I did not like it does not give explanations for wrong answers!!! I passed the exam on the first try!!! I must admit I used Cracking the CBEST for majority of my studying! It uses great explanations! Do not waste you time with Kaplan!!! Good Luck!
3,Purchased as a coupon organizer...,"I know that's not the intended use of the product, but I thought it'd be an ideal size. I'm not sure what else you'd use it for. It's too small to be useful as a filing system unless you have lots of receipts to keep track of, or you use it for bills... although even that would be awkward since the file isn't wide enough for envelopes. It's okay for coupons. I had to paste new labels onto the tabs, but that wasn't a big deal. My biggest complaints are the price and the annoying tie-closure. I found coupon organizers for 1/12th the price, and I could have just bought 2 and had the space I needed. The tie closure is tedious and I would have appreciated a small velcro tab instead. The organizer is HUGE in comparison to regular coupon organizers and can accomodate the larger coupons that I've had to fold and scrunch into my old organizers. I like having all my coupons in one organizer, but definitely see if you can find this (or a similar product) cheaper..."
2,Just plain hokey,"The stereotypes in this weightless novel are beyond annoying. Sorry, but I just couldn't see what other reviewers saw that would warrant giving this book anywhere near five stars. It wasn't a 'great ride' at all and I wonder how many friends and relatives reviewed the book in order to pad the star ratings!"
1,Tennessee as Bizarro-World (sigh),"East Tennesseans are used to being stereotyped, but this time even the stereotype isn't done well. The setting receives no descriptive treatment, the characters are thinly developed, there is no attempt to capture the vernacular, and the narrative is not believable. Would the Virginia state police let this man sleep on the shoulder of the interstate? Why would he rent a log cabin from someone waving a weed-eater at him, when he hasn't even arrived at his destination? This weak yarn may amuse those who hold fast to their Beverly Hillbillies view of the southern highlands, but it will annoy anyone who actually knows the place."
2,Sophomoric meanderings,"Not a good read. In fact, the previous review sounds suspiciously like it was penned by the author of the book. The same tone, the same sentence structure, the same verbage...The writing is contrived and the message seems autobiographical, the meanderings of a profoundly angry and possibly dysfunctional member of the not-so-fictional dysfunctional family that is described."
4,One of the best tribute albums,"Tribute albums are so often a bummer, but this one really works. Serge Gainsbourg just seems to be a great artist to interpret for English-speaking bands/performers. Mick Harvey's two albums of Serge covers with English lyrics are absolute gems. And this collection is almost as enjoyable as those. The best track is Kid Loco and Jarvis Cocker's take on ""I Have Come to Tell You That I'm Going,"" which has a late-night, downtempo feel. Not far behind is Marianne Faithful's rendition of the bawdy, hilarious ""Lola Rasta"" song. Gang of Four wannabees Franz Ferdinand and the Rakes both bring their angular, biting guitar work to the fore, and successfully so. One minor quibble is the Cat Power duet of ""J'Taime . . . "" - the version is done well enough, but this song has been covered so many times and is so over the top, it really didn't need to be recorded again. If you love Serge you will love this comp."
4,LP instead of cd,I just received this today and actually got the double LP instead of the cd. When typing in the upc code it comes up as a cd but is actually the double lp. Anyway enough of that. This is such wonderful music all of the tributes are spot on. Always nice to hear other people do their own version of something so beautiful. Check it out. If you like gainsbourg you will appreciate this.
4,Best seven bucks spent in a while,"Just picked this up in a used CD store, mostly for the awesome tackiness of the cover photo. Amazingly, the music inside is not only NOT tacky, it's just plain awesome. And totally worth quite a bit more than the seven bucks I spent. I feel lucky today..."
3,This Recording is a good one of this Opera but theres better,"This is a good recording of this opera. Vargas has a lovely voice, as does Mescheriakova. There are definitely some gems in this otherwise strange opera. The scene which opens with Alzira is beatiful. And while this is a good recording the best recording of this opera remains the Gardelli conducted Alzira, featuring Vargas fellow mexican Araiza, with the incomparable Cotrubas, Rootering, and Bruson. The recording is in good sound, and while it may not be packaged as pretty. It is by far superior."
5,SIMPLY GREAT,"This Album is the Best Live-Album I've heard so far. This Lady is a great Singer and should be very famous. I've also seen many of her concerts and know that she is a great Entertainer as well.I simply recommend this CD to any Soul/R&B Lovers; it should be in your CD Collection, definitely!"
1,nightmare in a CD-Rom,"Good Content...But a CD rom is the worst idea ever invented for learning information in the textbook world......If you are used to reading and highlighting text forgot that with this format! The interactive parts of the e-book are nice, but are not user friendly. I spent more money on paper and ink for the printer, then the silly CD is worth. This is a terrible use of technology and should really be reevaluated by the authors and publishers..A complete nightmare for college students who have to refer back to a specific page! If I could give it a ZERO, I would!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Nice Clock,"It is very nice and accurate clock with white dial and Arabic numbers, I like the feature that it does not make a noise during night time."
1,Poorly Made,"This clock is cheap, but also cheaply made. It looks fine for what I needed, but the paper face of the clock was uneven and bulged on one side so that hands touched as it went round and it looked uneven.I am returning it. even at this price it bother me to look at it."
3,"Too small, but works OK","I was a bit surprised to see how small this clock is. If you're looking for a real small clock for a tight place, this would be a good choice, but I think at $10 it's over priced."
4,"Easy Read, helpful for volunteer fundraisers!","I found this book and the board book in a file cabinet in the office of my new job. I am kind of a reading addict, so I was excited to see how these would match up to some of my more ""textbook oriented"" resources. I was pleasantly surprised with both the content and ease of read. This book is highly recommended for board members and volunteer fundraisers!"
3,"3 stars, only because the other Crisis releases are so good","8 Convulsions is a good record, don't let my 3 stars fool you. However, in comparison to The Hollowing, this record isn't as good. The song writing is much less evolved and the recording is of lesser quality."
1,Ramekin size smaller than packaging states,"I received the ramekins the mail today and was very disappointed because they are smaller than the manufacturer states they are. The item packaging and the website both state that the ramekins are 6 oz., yet they looked too small to hold 6 oz. so I used a measuring cup and measured out 6 oz. of water and poured the water into the ramekins to the very top. The ramekins could only take 4 oz. of water and the remaining 2 oz. remained in the measuring cup. I am returning the ramekins immediately...and have already printed the return label and have returned them to Amazon.com."
5,True communion with Jesus,"This book is so beautifully written that you feel as if you are walking hand in hand with Jesus as he shares His love and knowledge of your purpose. The book is very interesting in style and content as the various disciples speak to you of their relationship with Christ and what He has to offer us in His name. Be prepared to fall in love with your Saviour, His teachers, angels, and His heart. Excellent reading to fill you with knowledge and comfort."
2,Picky turkey junky cat turned it down.,"I was surprised when my turkey junky turned this one down. He's loved most of the other varieties in this series and well, this one just didn't make the grade. Had to flush it down the garbage disposal so the rest went back to the store for the egg souffles'. Gotta love that finicky part, huh? Anyway, I do recommend it anyway because of their high nutritional value. My rescue Persian cannot eat these shredded varieties because her previous owner kicked out her teeth on one side of her mouth. She doesn't care much for turkey anyway but I was disappointed that she couldn't chew these because of their high nutritional value. Gets tiring cutting up all that cat food! Recommend but with the above experience."
4,Great idea for a book!,"This book was written by the author as it was about her family.They were circus people dating back to 1800's.Each chapter in the book first shows a black and white picture and then the chapter is about the characters in the picture and how they became and stayed with the circus.The author wrote about them as thought it was her family members and she was third generation from the elephant trainer and one of the clowns.Not every chapter was about the people of the circus, one or two were of the animals and the great flood that killed theelephants of the circus, and then one story was about the barn where they housed the carts and props for the circus.I did enjoy this book alot, and I would recommend it to anyone who wanted to read something alittle different."
4,Good quality containers,"I wanted a travel container with a sifter for loose face powder and the widest container works well. I didn't expect any of the other containers to have a sifter. The two middle size do but they aren't all that useful for loose powder because they are too narrow for a powder brush. They are, however, nice containers and I'm sure I'll get good use from them."
2,Disappointing,"I found this book somewhat hard to read in spots because of poor editing. I had the impression that English may not be the author's first language, and editing missed errors in grammar that, to me, made the book appear less professional, considering its topic. The information it contains is good, and it would be an acceptable reference for someone wanting an idea of what to expect from an anesthetic experience; however, I felt it was overpriced..., being such a slender volume."
4,Great tire,This is a great tire. It is super easy to mount up tubeless and did not leak at all. If it wasn't for all the goat heads in Boise I wouldn't need to run Stans at all.
3,Very sweet love story,"I enjoyed Ryan's and Kelly's story, it was a good read on healing from past loves and moving on. The first in the Blackstone series gives a nice introduction to the rest of the family therefore it would be better, not required though, to read them in order. Jeremy's story is up next and is better than Ryan's with Sheldon's story so far being the best."
5,They Make 'em BETTER Thank They Used Too,"I have a great fondness for old full-size Chevy's and some of other makes. I have a small collection of 1:18 scale models of these and just received a model of the 1967 Chevrolet Impala SS coupe. This Ertl model's fit and finish, especially the paint, is the best out of all of the models I own. I'm not sure if comepetition is heating up in the 1:18 scale autombile model market, but something is prompting manufacturers to improve the breed. They sure don't make real cars the way they used to, but in the 1:18 scale model realm, it seems they're making them better than they used to."

4,A movie that will make you want to watch more anime.,"After watching this movie I wanted to get more and more anime. It is a pretty generic movie and story but the animation is superb, just watch the beginning and you'll know. I hope that somewhere down the line there will be a sequel. If not a direct sequel hopefully the team will get back together for another go."
3,"Good, but under-achieving","Overall I was content. Nothing in this experience was bad, but it constantly felt like it could have been much more. The first half of the movie setup characters with incredible powers, and teased with the potential for those powers. The second half got bogged down in character interactions and drama, but I was expecting it to build on and extend the action sequences from the first half, but instead the movie sorta fizzled.The saving grace was the consistent high-quality production values, from interesting characters, consistently good voice acting, direction, and animation quality. My only real complaint was lack of action in the second half, and this coming from a guy who admits to being an action junkie (i.e. while it didn't feed my needs, it might be plenty for someone else)."
4,Good movie bad packaging,Love the movie but the packaging is not the typical plastic case. The case is hard cardboard and a slip cover. The case is the only reason I did not give 5 stars
3,Pretty Good,The Movie plays on my Play Station 2 pretty well untill Toola goes into the forest. Then it skips the whole little scene where Agito saves her and continues to where she's crying and Agito is apologizing to her that he shoulda told her that the forest was dangerous. It skips like that in some other places but I forgot exactly where. Sometimes it won't complete the whole movie and just stops so I would have to start it all over again from the begining or find out which part it stoped on. I'll have to ask my friend and see if her brother can find out what's wrong with it.
4,Daughter Loved It,"She's an Anime Head. This was on the top of her lengthy list of Anime needs.She loved it. Doesn't matter what I think. She was happy, so I'm happy."
1,Not Worth the Price of Admission,"Simply put this movie is another boring pedantic man vs nature, technology bad, tree hugging good. I write this as a card carry Green liberal. It plods along in a predicable formula right up to the end. Most of the animation is beautiful but grates on your nerves from time to time as obvious short cuts have been used in a poor mix of styles. You can keep the money I spent on the disc. I want the time I wasted watching this, hoping it would get better, back. I should have re watched Princess Mononoke or Spirited Away.As Rule I do not write reviews. I am only taking the time to write this in hopes of saving someone Else's evening and money."
2,Great Artwork Stupid Storyline,The artwork and animation is first rate. The color and most of the production values are very good. The voiceovers are pretty good as well though the balance is sometimes off so that it is difficult to understand them over the background noise.But the story is really dumb. Believing that a plant could grow as fast as a man could run? Don't these people understand that growth requires energy? How about that you could put legs under a volcano and have it walk around. Apparently the writer doesn't know that a volcano is powered from the core of the earth and not from something inside itself.I give this a marginal recommendation because this was a superb production lacking only a reason for being made - a story to tell.
3,"unoriginal, but visually stunning","If a flying fortress, technology from the past, a hero with possessed powers, and a moral struggle with nature and humankind sound familiar, it's because they've all been done before. Origin doesn't add much to the pot in these areas, featuring rather depthless characters and a plot with less twists than Interstate 40. It borrows heavily from Ghibli greats (Nausicaa, Castle in the Sky, Mononoke), but lacks the charm and conviction of these films. Still, Origin will likely win its share of fans thanks to the visual adventure and immersive backgrounds. If characters and plot aren't an issue, and you just want to be entertained, the eye candy that is Origin may be for you."
3,Inferior imitation,"I am glad this movie was cheap because it is not worth keeping. It is an inferior imitation of ""Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind;"" a much better treatment of the same theme and done some 20 years earlier. Also the plot and characters were poorly developed. If you have seen Nausicaa, you will be disappointed with Origins. If you enjoy 21st century animation technology, you will find this movie more like 20th century television-style animation. Still the environmental message is important and gives value to the movie."
2,"Ok, from a technical point of view, fatally flawed story-wise.","I found this movie to be terribly disappointing. The setting, while not terribly original, had potential for a good story Unfortunately, the plot is cringe-worthy. I won't go into detail to avoid spoilers, but if you thought there would be some clever plot-twists to put some nuances into the naive ""forest good, technology bad"", you'd be mistaken. There are many other things wrong with the plot, but I think the walking volcano (yes, you read that right) sums it up nicely. Was there really a need to put mechanical legs on a volcano so that it can uproot itself and travel a couple of hundred miles, all the while spewing fire and brimstone to finally erupt in a completely different place? They didn't even try to make the plot work, and it shows all through the movie. Characters are flat as cardboard too. Just barely avoids one star rating because of decent, though not spectacular visuals.In one word, avoid."
3,Its okay,"Note that this film gets compared to Miyazaki's because of the theme, but it is not Miyazaki's work for sure. While this one had the potential if it were a mini-series, it's just simply too rushed. You get great story buildup for the first half, then nothing but a main character screaming TULLAAAAAAAA (the female damsel character) in the last half. In the end I was more interested in the unanswered questions about some of the creatures rather than the flat main characters. Good animation and music help prop this one up."
3,It's okay.,"Origin is very pretty to look at great animation. That is about it. The story is almost nonexistent.Of course that could just be because of poor editing, translation and the genre in general. At certain points the editing seems like large chunks were cut out because characters are deeply in love with each other. Again this could be because of the genre. The trailer made the movie seem like the animation would be excellent, and for the most part it is, on top of a story that would have some epic tale behind it. Unfortunately the story falls apart after the first twenty minutes or so. In the end it's just okay."
4,Miyazaki?,"This film has a lot of similarities to the Hayao Miyazaki film, Princess Mononoke, or at least Miyazaki's themes of nature and renewal. It is well worth watching. The animation is not as exacting as Miyazaki's, but well-done. We saw the name Miyazaki in the highlights for the film, and thought he was involved, but it turns out one of the actors (voices) in the film was by the Japanese actress, Aoi Miyazaki. So while we more or less saw it by mistaking it for a Studio Ghibili film, it was still worth the time."
2,"A decent prequel, but not the greatest...","Baten Kaitos Origins fixed some problems that the original had; the voice actors were decent this time and they added a ""wing dash"" and all that to make the player go faster and be able to hop over obstacles that one wouldn't have been able to overcome in the original. But the gameplay is still repetitive and gets boring after a while...not to mention the sidequest of mammoth proportions you have the option of undertaking. Not the best game I've ever played, but certainly not the worst."
4,A++,Came quickly and well packaged. It's a good game but without the booklet was a bit of a learning curve but still very doable.
5,totally amazin,i had been looking for a place to buy this game for years what a shock to find it here on for such a good price the game is beautiful it came early and not once have i had any issues with it i definent buy for any of you turn based rpg game players out there
4,Valmont Bra,"This bra was an excellent price, very good material. It fit me well and I would recommend to my friends. Very comfortable and true to size."
1,ZERO SUPPORT,"The woman in the picture must be laying down because this bra while comfortable to wear (until you have to jog) offers no lift or support of any kind. For us more endowed women it does nothing to enhance the torpedoes if you know what I'm sayin. It gets points for comfort as I wore it all day and it didn't dig into my skin. However when running or even brisk walking the ""girls"" were all over the place. In a T-shirt it looked as if I had nothing on underneath. Please save your money and move on. Maybe an A or B cup can get away with this but there are certainly much better options out there."
3,A Guidebook to Waking the Dead: Embracing the Life God Has for You,"December 16,2012""A Guidebook to Waking the Dead: Embracing the Life God Has for You"" byJohn Eldredge was rated ""three"". This book is for a class called ""Spiritual Leadship"" which starts January 7, 2013. I have not read the for any evaluation.However, class is over March 2013, at which I will give my opinonBarbara Clark"
1,Worthless Workbook,"In addition to the original book being a worthless mixture of New Age spirituality and fantasy references, it seems that the workbook is filled with more references to The Matrix, The Lord of the Rings and other science fiction than there are references to scripture.This workbook not only has space for YOU to write what you are feeling in your ""heart"" but the AUTHORS write in what THEY are thinking in the fill-in-the-blank sections. This comes across as egotistical and is distracting. Why should be care how the author feels right now as he is writing it?A waste of paper, after the first chapter I stopped writing in answers because the authors seemed more interested in sharing with me how THEY felt about THEMSELVES than in helping me to learn about myself. The worst workbook ever."
5,good companion to the book,"This journal is a great companion to the book ""Waking the Dead."" Upon first reading the book I wasn't completely captured by it, but the journal really explores the book in a deeper way - great for group discussion or individually."
5,A True Awakening,This book has set me on a great spiritual adventure. If you like mythic movies and tales this book will speak to your heart and open a different way of looking at the battle we are facing as Christians. The chapters are divided in such a way that each one builds on the one before while creating a common thread that is easy to apply to our own journey.
2,exchanges can add up with postage costs,"My husband got me a sweatshirt but ordered a men's size by mistake. Since I wanted a women's size they would not let me do an exchange, but said I had to return mine and re-order another thus I would have to pay postage there and postage back unlike like many companies who give free postage on exchanges or just charge postage one way. (If I had wanted another men's size of the same style they would have only charged postage one way.)Also, it would be helpful for them to label their products better. The description was just ""Wisconsin Badgers Perennial Hooded Sweatshirt"" - no mention of whether it was men's, women's or children's.The quality was fine, not the super thick sweatshirt but an average thickness. Appropriately priced."
4,Yum,"This is a wonderful country-rock type album with a heavy Neil Young influence. Moorer's voice is sexy and bluesy and glides effortlessly over crunchy, hot, yummy guitars. A seriously melancholic thread weaves its way through every track, (w/ lyrics like ""The cuckoo clock quit chirping/The bird fell out and died/Spent its whole life working/And never learned to fly/It ran out of time.""), which is very much to my liking.Also recommended: Anne McCue's Roll. She's an Australian femme w/ serious electric guitar chops."
1,Are you kidding me?,"What a dark, hopeless piece of dung. Don't bother with the other reviews, this album is not worth your time-mine went into the garbage."
5,Waiting for this,I had not listened to Allison for a couple of months and then I saw that she had a new cd out. I listened to all the tracks on CMT.com before buying it so I knew what I was getting. This album is full of the rocksy/bluesy Allison music that I have come to love. This woman has some soul in her voice!! 'The Duel' is my favorite from this album. If you liked 'Miss Fortune' then you will love 'The Duel'
3,Needs Better Accompaniment,"Lyrically Allison hits a home run as this CD is pretty chilling, personal, gut-wrenching stuff. Vic Chesnutt seems absolutely chirpy compared to this. My complaint is with the no-frills, workman-like back-up band that adds little to the goings-on.Possibly the most downcast CD in my collection."
2,Organic ones are too stretchy,"The ones I own are organic cotton, so maybe the fabric is different, but they are much too stretchy and they don't have as many velcro tabs as the Kiddopotamus ones to keep it fastened well enough; my daughter always wiggles her arms out. And according to the ""Happiest Baby"" DVD, the arms are the most important part to have swaddled, the legs don't matter. Also, it has darts and shaping, and I can't figure out where they're supposed to go, they don't fit on her in any place that makes sense.I like the Kiddopotamus ones much better."
3,Still not the perfect bulb,"Soon after I put these in one of them gave way. Poof, there goes a $3 light bulb! The rest of them are still holding on for some 3-4 months now, so I hope that's a good sign.Note that these are clear so they're best suited for applications that already have some kind of a light diffuser or the bulb will be pointed at the ceiling."
2,1 BULB ARRIVED SHATTERED in PIECES,"I haven't tried the light bulbs yet, but when I opened the box and heard lots of rattling, I found one bulb completely shattered in small pieces. Unlikely that shipping process damaged only one bulb this badly, so have to conclude that it was shipped already broken (which would have easily been heard when packaging)."
5,Thank you for the beautifull music!,"The second album from Rolando! I just could not wait, after buying the first CD with Italian Arias. And he did it again, BRAVO! I-m not an opera-expert at all, just loving beautifull music. And that is what Rolando makes, beautifull music.Untill june last year I never listened to opera; then after visiting Don Carlo in het Muziektheater in Amsterdam, a new world opened. Rolando is performing with his voice,technical wonderfull, but also with his body and soul. That is what it makes it so beautifull in my opinion. One of the arias is called: JE SUIS L'OISEAU. A bird has to sing, has no choice, Rolando indeed is like a bird: He HAS to sing and he sings beautifull. Hope he will do this for many years, so that for many people he can bring joy and music in their lifes."
4,Rolando is rollin,"What a voice! Hardly known to American opera aficionados, Villazon is a hidden treasure. His tenor vocal range is incredible. I was a little dissappointed in some of the selections, but overall, this is a very satisfying album. We should hear more about and by this great singer."
5,Something Different,First heard Jens with the Kruger Brothers on a bluegrass radio program doing a very good version of a Chritmas Carol. Was looking for that recording and came accross the band. I would not call it traditional bluegrass but what ever one calls it GOOD is the easiest. On this album it mostly features Jens and his briliant banjo picking. He has to be one of the best with the instrament. This album is not what one would expect of a banjo picker. I can't really describe what style one would call it except maybe banjo with a classical twist. Really an incredible work. Highly recomend this if you like just good music that is done a little differently. He is an incredeble picker.
5,Garmin NUVI 350,"This unit orginally sold at close to $1000. At $200 it is a bargain. If you require a basic GPS this is the best on the market with Text to Speech Directions, and NavTeq maps. I found out that you do not need a larger GPS since when you drive you listen to the directions rather than look at the screen. Not only that, it comes with all the accessories that Garmin charges extra for on their other and newer units. I understand that Garmin may discontinue it soon, so grab it while it is available."
3,Garmin nuvi 350,"The verdict is still out on this product. At first, I loved it. Easy to use, up to date maps, everything I wanted. Then, about a week after we got it, it started having difficulty ""acquiring satellites"". This problem persisted for a week with the gps barely working. We reset a dozen or more times, downloaded the latest maps (contrary to Amazon's comment about having the latest software), and reset again. So far so good but it has been only a day or so. If the problem returns I will return it for another brand.As a side note, the Garmin website is only fair. So far, they haven't replied to my question sent to their help desk.My recommendation: proceed with caution."
2,My experience with Nuvi and downloading maps,I brought the Nuvi 350 and wanted to download the newest version of the North America maps. It was a free download but becuase I have Vista it was impossible to load. I had to call technical support at Garmin 2 times to get this thing to work. I like the GPS but I didn't know that it was going to take up so much time to download the maps. I felt that they should have had the latest version of this map already loaded onto the GPS. In the future I am going for the disk. Also the first time that I used it the directions were totally wrong it told me to take a left instead of a right and if I would have followed it I would have ended up in the bushes. But since I have the newest map maybe I won't encounter this problem in the future.
3,"Expensive, a little dissapointed with performance","With all the press about Garmin GPS units I was a little dissapointed with the Nuvi 350. My first GPS purchase was a Mio C220 for $199 and thought it was a great unit and had much more options and configuration changes than the Nuvi. I gave my wife the Mio and wanted a text to speech unit and that is why I purchased the Nuvi. Don't get me wrong, the Nuvi is a good unit, but I would be much happier if it was $100 cheaper. The graphics are fair and takes a long time to recalculate while you miss the turn after it finishes. Also the POI's are fair and the Mio are much better and have the POI icons on the screen as you are driving. I also thought that the Nuvi animation had more of a little cartoon appearance. The Mio was much more professional with much more detail and displays every street name as you approach them. All in all, for text to speech the Nuvi is a pretty good price compaired with other units on the market."
4,Garman Nuvi 350,Nice compact unit;easy to use. In rural MI navigation logic for shortest route is not nearly as good as what I have experienced with other GPS navigation units. It will get you there but don't expect the most efficient route. Urban navigation seems equal to other units.
5,Garmin Nuvi 350 -,"The product pays for itself when you visit new places and when you are lost.It makes driving more automated. It is good and bad. But i would say it is for the good. Our life style has changed over these years and many of our day today gadgets/appliances have gone through so many changes/upgrades. I think this is now the time for the cars. It is really helpful. Not to worry about 'I forgot to bring the Mapquest printouts'. Also it allows to search places by name e.g. Applebees, Sears and Walmart. And the biggest plus point is its portability. You can carry with you in your pocket when you are walking down in the streets of New York or else where. Also, has some cool features like Mp3 Player and the socket for Secure Digital Storage card."
5,Garmin Nuvi 350 review,"This was a gift for my father who drives regularly and he absolutely loves it. It is very convenient, accurate and very portable. Both the display and the voice are very clear and the sattelite signal is very well recieved. There are many convenient functions that we haven't yet taken advantage of, but we are very satisfied."
4,350 review,"This is the first GPS navigator I have purchased so have nothing to compare too. I have learned the battery life isn't too long but with the lighter adapter it isn't a problem. Most of the maps are correct but I have had a couple towns in the wrong place, one by 20 miles. I wouldn't use this as the only navigator but it is a nice addition to a road map. The directions do appear to be pretty accurate in the cities. I like having the additionial information available at you finger tips, for instance, hotel and fuel in the area I am driving. I found some of the instruction were not easy to follow. If you didn't have some computer experience, I think you'd have some trouble operating it. However, after using it for a month I would certainly recommend the 350 to anyone that wants a starter unit."
2,No more Garmin for me!,"I have owned the Garmin Nuvi 350 for 3+ years. I've read the reviews from Consumer Reports (CR) which gave it high marks so I purchased the unit based on that. Wrong move! The biggest fustration for me was powering on the unit and waiting at least 5 minutes to pick up a signal. Sometimes even longer...sigh. Thinking my unit might've been a fluke I recommended my sister to buy the same unit. Guess what, same satellite reception problem. She had to buy an add-on antenna to alleviate the problem. But the reception time was still slow compared to her friends' Magellans or TomToms. In retrospect, I regretted buying the Nuvi 350. I blame CR for recommending such a product and myself for trusting their recommendations without research. Read the other reviews here on Amazon; they tell the whole story!"
5,"Easy, Accurate and Portable!","I chose this brand/model because it was recommended by Consumer Reports. I was planning on using it for an upcoming road trip, but it's already been so useful in my local area, I don't know how I've managed without it! You CAN'T get lost! And no more writing down addresses and/or directions, and then trying to read them while you're driving. It will find you the nearest gas station in general, or the nearest Chevron station in particular. I'm much more willing to explore unknown areas, because I can always find my way back now. It comes ready to use, and is completely intuitive - I haven't needed to use the instructions at all. I love this thing!"
5,Easy to Use,"This GPS is very easy to use and intuitive. The MP3 player works well, thereby allowing me to listem to music and have the music interrupted for directions, a very convienent feature."
4,Nuvi Vroom! Vroom!,"Small, easy to use, purchase driven by other reviews. The product works as expected - right out of the box. Intuitive touch screen, no learning curve. Bought this product in April 2007 and it did not know my address in Orlando that exists before April 2006. Also, when there is no destination provided, it shows the driving speed - this is good, but it remembers your max speed - this could be good news for a cop and bad news for you."
3,"Love it, but it has a major design flaw",I have had my Garmin Nuvi 350 for 4 years this month (4/2011). I even bought a chip for Europe and used it in Great Britain. I adore my nuvi except for one MAJOR flaw. About a year ago the on/off button became hard to use and then quit completely. I can turn it on only by plugging it into car charger or usb port. When searching online for this problem I found out it is a common occurrence. UPDATE: I found a guy online who repairs them and makes a fix so it doesn't happen again. I shipped it off to him and he fixed it for a reasonable price. Happy!
5,LOVE IT!,This is the best thing I have ever purchased! It has been a huge help in finding my way to places and you can even have it list of food and hotels in the area. I have really enjoyed having this and I would recommend this brand to anyone who is looking for an GPS system.
3,Mostly Good..But Not Always,Most of the time love the Nuvi 350...it has found great shortcuts and is usually very reliable. Verbal directions for street turns is a great feature. Small enough to carry in your purse.But on the downside it is occassionally completely off (this happens very rarely but obviously a problem.) But most problematic..it can sometimes take more than 10 minutes for the satellite to come up.
3,nuvi350,"Garmin nüvi 350 3.5-Inch Portable GPS Navigator with Text-to-Speechall told am satisfied with unit, however the maps displayed for the massachsetts area(boston and others) definitly need updating. I got a 2009 update from garmin when I registered product and it basicly same as previous maps. the way they get you from place to place doesnot make sense sometimes . I am an on the road service tech and know my way around the boston area quite well and it seems like the person who does the directions has no idea of the boston area. As I saidam satisfied but it needs improvement"
4,Excellent navigator,"I bought this unit when it was on sale at Walmart about a month ago and is worth it's weight in gold for the 'directionally challenged' among us. As previously mentioned, it does not always choose the most direct route, but the easiest route. Some have said it takes time to acquire the satellite but I've had great results with it so far locking on to a signal within 30 seconds (and often much faster) which I think is more than acceptable. It has some really cool gadgets too. An audible book player, world clock, currency converter, calculator and measurement converter. It also has ability to play mp3's and jpegs and, if your stereo has an accessory input jack, you can play it through your car stereo system. Find nearest food, lodging, gas stations, and much more. All in all, I am very happy with it."
4,Great if no parts are missing!,"I ordered this for my college aged son to put in his car and take to school with him. He did the research and I agreed with his choice. Not wanting a Europe inclusive model, this fit the bill. It's easy to use, has lots of neat features and can be carried from vehicle to vehicle.BUT- when it came to us from Amazon, pieces of the charger were missing and he could not plug it into the wall and charge it. We called Garmin and it took about 2 weeks to send us the replacement part. They were very understanding and there was no charge - BUT- it did take forever to connect and speak to a live person there. Next time I would purchase these units at the retail level to make sure the components are in the box."
5,Buy It - You Will not be Sorry!!,This is absolutely amazing. Drove from Indiana to Boston & it made the trip so easy. It tells you in advance which lane to be in & the name of where you are turning. Take it from me - I always get lost - this is an item you will never want to be without again once you use it.
3,"overall ok, some limitations","Directions while on surface streets are decent. Once on freeways (I live in Los Angeles therefore there are a lot of freeways and overpasses) it can give faulty directions.Overall for somebody with direction dyslexia, it's a life saver."
4,A must have for travelers,"I own a 360 and just bought my wife the 350 for her car. I have not owned any other brand, but the Magellan used by Hertz is terrible. Being in sales I find the Nuvi to be a MUST HAVE when ever I am in another city or need to find a gas station, restaurant, hotel or whatever quickly. I still use it when I am home but find that my old ""trial and error"" routes are better because the Nuvi only looks at distance from A to B.I have not subscribed the the Traffic funtion so I cannot comment on that. Lastly, do not be surprised if some new destinations are not yet on the pre-loaded maps that come with the device. Overall, though this has been a fantastic purchase. Also, the Bluetooth function in the 360 is not worth the price so stick with the 350."
5,Garmin 350...Best money Spent This Year,"I purchased the Garmin 350 with text to speech and was very apprehensive that I would be satisfied with the technology. It ended up being the best purchase I made the entire year. The user interface is so easy even my eight year old has it mastered. I am on the road most of the day and travel in unfamiliar territory often. The Garmin has not let me down yet. Easy to see screen, volume level and sound quality are beautiful, an enormous number of points of interest, and very affordable. Thank you Amazon for shipping it so quickly!!"
3,Pricing an issue,"This is a decent GPS. However, the battery isn't holding up (and there's no way to replace it), the retail price has gone up 40% since 2008, and the maps are incredibly expensive to update ($60 to 70 per update). Streets don't change that fast to be worth it more than once every 4 years. (If it were $25, I'd do it every year.)The bad points are that it takes forever to sync with satellites. I'm often two miles down the road before the Nuvi starts to recommend a route. Also, it makes errors, telling me to turn when I shouldn't. Lastly, it waits until the last minute to warn me a turn is coming up. By then, it's too late to change lanes.If they made the maps less expensive and the batteries user-replaceable, it would help a great deal. Also, they need to do something about the price. It won't be long before you can do this on your Iphone (or other phones), so they had better stay competitive."
4,Nuvi 350 - After 1 Year Review,I bought my Nuvi 350 in May 2008. I used it extensively and for the first year it was great. Even when it took a long time getting satellite reception I would keep the flip antenna down and it would calculate my route without first getting the satellites. This is a great feature which (by following the trip route) at least gave me a head start on my trip.However in June 2009 I started having problems with the unit. The GPS unit was not getting satellite reception. This was very frustrating to me. I tried several fixes including updating the maps and resetting the unit. Nothing worked.Finally I contacted Garmin directly. I explained my situation and they asked me to ship the unit to their offices in Kansas. Two weeks later I received a replacement unit and it has been working ever since.I believe in giving credit where credit is due so kudos to Garmin for standing by their product and replacing it for me.
5,Great,This gps is great! It gives me directions far enough in advance that I can change lanes well before my turn. It gives me turns by street names and lets me know if I need to stay right or left for a freeway merger. I can drive like I'm a local even if I've never been there before!!!
1,mismatched part in box,"Garmin nüvi 350 3.5-Inch Portable GPS NavigatorI'm puzzled by the favorable reviews posted by others. My own unit must have been an exception. As far as I know, there's nothing wrong with the GPS itself, but it can't be interfaced with either the window suction cup (comes in box) or the dashboard mount (sold separately). Both terminate in ball joints. The GPS provides no matching ball socket, but rather sits in a connector (comes in box) which has a ball socket. The ball socket is way too small. No amount of force could push the ball into the socket. Whatever its power, the GPS is thus far dead weight, because I have no useful fixture in which to hold it."
1,garmin nuvi 350 junk,"The NUVI 350 is junk and shouldn't even get one star. It doesn't track my current location properly ie ; says I'm in a location I'm not,and the maps are incomplete. It also comes with a scimpy owners manual; I will be returning the item today."
2,DHL botched delivey,"I ordered this product and payed extra for next-day delivery from DHL. DHL claimed to have attempted delivery even though no delivery person ever appeared. Not willing to wait until Monday for another botched attempt, so am sending the unit back to Amazon and will wait till mid November for a refund. Meanwhile, I will purchase the item from NewEgg, where I have experienced nothing but outstanding customer service and delivery. Its a shame Amazon can't use FedEx or UPS for reliable and ethical delivery service. Amazon consistently has low prices, but low prices are nothing unless the item is delivered as promised. I will stop using Amazon and will look elsewhere in the future. Amazon is great until something goes wrong, then it sucks, and its too late to do anything about it."
5,Great GPS for a great price,"Granted, this is the only GPS I have ever used but I love it. Being a map geek I am especially in tune to the accuracy of such things and although you may know better directions in your hometown, when you're away, it's invaluable."
3,Not real impressed,"I am not real impressed with the Nuvi 350. We used it on a trip and it did get us where we wanted. We actually new the way but wanted to see if the garmin would get us there the same way. It did except it wanted to put us on the Florida turnpike a few exits from where we were actually going on I-95. It did recalculate and go the way we wanted to go. When we were looking for places to stop and rest or eat, it did not give us places to stop at. It is great for just getting you to an area. I don't use it except for going someplace that I do not know. If you want all the bells and whistles, this is not the one for you."
5,Garmin Nuvi 350,"I purchased a reconditioned model and it has performed perfectly. All of the listed accessories were included in the package. If there is one complaint to be made, it is that the windshield mount falls off the glass even though the glass was meticulously cleaned before trying to apply the suction cup. I bought the dashboard friction mount and that solves the problem. I like the ability to position the GPS a bit closer to me which the friction mount provides. Overall, this model couldn't be any better for me."
1,It dies just after warranty period,"I used this unit about 15 months and its died,no satellite reception, also its speaker died in 8th months.But most important thing about this product , garmin's customer service view,they charges $175.00 to fix this unit and at the same date this products price is $159.99 at most of famous retailers.I am not going to buy garmin again..."
4,Garmin 350,"This has replaced my Garmin 250W. The advantage with 350 is, it is sleek and comfortably fits in your pocket, gives most details we need when we are driving or looking for places to dine or visit etc. The voice prompting helps us very much and don't need to look at the screen every now and then.The main disadvantage I am facing is the mounting is very bad. I am not able to mount the GPS on my dashboard as I cannot mount it on my windshield being in California. Can any body suggest any idea how to mount the same?Otherwise I will recommend this product which is available at a very affordable price"
3,GPS,"Maps could be more current, interface is not intuitive, subtle change in address syntax could take one very far away from one's intended destination. However, it's better than being lost on one's own."
4,I Like It,Garmin nüvi 350 3.5-Inch Portable GPS NavigatorWorks well (as expected) but would like to see improvement in several features. When simulating driving a route the user should be able speed up the drive to complete it in several minnutes rather than actual time. Also when setting up a route we should be able to compare and select from several different routes to the destination.Easy to use.
3,NUVI 350 TEST,THE NUVI 350 WORKS WELL IF IT IS UP TO DATE. MINE HAD A DELI ADDRESS THAT HAD BEEN CLOSED FOR YEARS. ON THE WAY TO MY GRANDSONS BASKETBALL GAMES IT HAD ME TURNING LEFT INTO A FOREST AND KEPT REPEATING TO MAKE A U TURN. I WENT TO MY OTHER GRANDSONS GAME AND IT WORKED VERY GOOD. I WILL HAVE TO DO SOME MORE TESTING TO MAKE SURE I'M SATISFIED WITH IT.
1,Just awful,"This product is just awful. It takes forever to acquire a satellite. Once it does, it is initially confused as to where it is, basically thinking it is at the last destination it reached. I've faithfully updated the firmware every time a new iteration comes out and the product doesn't get any better. In areas where there are a lot of streets, it gets confused and sends you in the wrong direction. I would not recommend this product to anyone. I would give it zero stars if Amazon had such a rating."
1,My Nuvi is awesome!!!,I absolutely love my Nuvi!! It has saved me so many miles and so much time! Always dependable!! I am looking to purchase a second one for a family member for Xmas!!! Great Buy!!!
2,Bad LCD color balance under Polarized sun glass,"The GPS perform good as those 4 or 5 star reviews, no further mention.The very bad issue is the LCD turn from white to red pink under polarized sun glass. Improper LCD engineering for white/color balance. I don't see this kind of problem in HP/IBM/Sony/Toshiba/ Laptop and PDA LCD screen."
3,Still waiting,"I've had trouble with defective units so far. The first one stopped receiving satalite signals within any acceptable time frame (started taking over 20 minutes to get the signal). The second one started repeatably freezing. With two placed side by side, however, the second could receive signals faster than the first - so that seems to be a defective unit and not a design defect.I'm trying one more time. While they were working, they worked great and seemed to support most of the positive reviews around here. It gets the three stars for that (average of 5 and 0). I have hopes for the third and expect I was just unfortanate to receive two defective units."
4,"useful, must learn all the options.","Now I am almost happy with NUVI 350. I found some problems, I was purchase this for my recent Canada visit, I choose toll free express way. On the way I visit my friend, Almost near his home I lost, then I call him by phone and I made it. Then I want go to London Ontario through Brige to Canada through Detroit, but my NUVI guide me to Cleveland and Ohio, that means I should travell another 450 miles instead of 150miles. After some time I realize some thing wrong is going on and search with map, then I came back and took I94 east and made Bridge to canada, then My NUVI help me to made. If you going for a long trip, do not choose toll free.Another one is that near my home, going to down town, NUVI avoiding fastest root to access I94 and guid me through too much local then access I94.Easy operation, real handy, ready too use, fit in the pocket, light weight, clear sound etc. But I don't like mp3 player."
4,Love the navigation system!,"This is our first navigation system and we both love it! The female voice is very soothing and never wakes my son up from his nap! :) We have used the system to guide us on a 90 mile trip blindly with no previous knowledge of the roads and it worked beautifully! The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because the screen could be bigger. It's a tad small. But nonetheless, would purchase again!"
4,Nuvi- inexpensive and satisfactory,"I work as an Admissions counselor for a University and do a lot of traveling. Frustrated with the pages of directions from online map sites, I got advice from friends and tried the Nuvi. I've found it to be extremely helpful when finding high schools and colleges. It has also assited me in finding local food places. One great feature I've loved is the ability to search for hotels near my destination. The thing my boss loves is that he's saving money in printing and gas (yeah for not getting lost!)A couple of problems- I've found that the turning warning is about 50 feet off. (still need to call garmin help about that) Some businesses are slightly before or after the location that the Nuvi has recorded.I'm planning on buying at least one more for our admissions office, and am very happy with how the Nuvi has helped me to be on time to the various appointments that go along with my profession."
3,"Good quality, but some drawbacks","I have used it for several times during this month. It can find well-know locations, but when it comes to resident house in a small road, it has problem to navigate(it can' find it).The map is not new, only 2006.There was also an annoying time that the machine was dead last weekend. I had to park along the road and reset it.I feel the Text-Speech is not very useful, because it is really not necessary to know the road name in most of the case. However, the function is well made. The road name is pronounced quite well.In all it is a good product, but the stability need to be improved."
4,"Ok, only tiny problems","This product has been great, the text-to-speech feature is great. I would like to see it keep the direction I have to turn on the top info bar so that way when im on a multi-lane road I have an idea of which side I need to be on and im not endangering others on the road switching lanes abruptly. Has only had one problem with one way streets where I live."
4,functional and inexpensive,"The Nuvi350 is an older model of the Nuvi line but it is as functional as ever. This one was the 3rd one I've purchased as gifts in the past few years.The screen is a bit small compared to some of the newer models and factory installed GPS systems, but it is just as useful. A particularly useful feature of this system is the ability to navigate to coordinates rather than a street address. This comes in really handy when hiking or looking for uninhabited fishing spots. The $3500 GPS/camera package in my SUV doesn't even do that.... :/The first NUVI350 I bought for my wife many years ago cost me $850 at BestBuy.... presently at $200 it can't be beat for the functionality."
4,GPS,This is my second GPS and I really like this one. Good price. Easy to use. Gets me to where I need to be...
3,Nice unit but out of date maps and points of interest,"I love the portability of this unit. The text to speech is great. The satellite capture is fast, and works well in every vehicle I've tried, even inside the house. The off road option is nice for when one is deep inside a shopping mall or on streets to new for the maps. The option to use this as a pedestrian is really cool to. So a very feature laden device.The bad is that in my own neighborhood, a major street that was completed 10 years ago is not listed, as are stores that have existed for 5 years. While I obviously don't need that much accuracy in my own neighborhood, I am concerned about what happens when I take it somewhere I am not familiar with.Overall good value, but it could have been so much more."
5,Highly recommended,"Reasonable price, good user interface, a lot of information.I like this gadget!!! I thought I did't need GPS as I was kind of exploring on my own guy. But after I experience the convenience of this product I change my mind. Try and use it."
5,Great GPS,We love this GPS it is so small and slim. It has a ton of features and is 95% accurate on locations and directions. We have had only 2 occasions where the GPS has not shown proper coordinates and that was because the roads are new. My husband emailed the company and they said they would add the roads in their next software update. All in all a great little GPS - we bought one for my mother for her birthday and she loves hers too.
2,not as good as expected,"The product fell way below my expectations. I have used navigators before, this one took a while to get the coordinates and would sometimes get confused on a location and would keep on giving wrong directions even after we arrived at the desired location. I would rather pay a little more for a better product."
5,Great GPS,"We owned a Mio GPS, but, even after updating the maps, our house which was built in 2003 was not on the GPS... This GPS had it from the begining and is great at guiding us on our vacation."
4,"Garmin 350, GPS","I had borrowed one earlier, so I knew what to expect before bought this model. My initial thoughts were to buy a more expensive model, but after learning that map updates are so expensive, I decided it was better to buy these cheaper models every couple years. I'd love to have the European map file on my GPS, as I occasionally go to Europe. I rented a car in Italy a few months ago, and insisted on having a GPS. I had a Toyota, and the built-in GPS was next to worthless.A story I thought it was cute, is that we had the grandkids in our van with us, and had the DVD running for them, and the GPS on the windshield. When we got close to our hotel, my wife took the GPS down, but found out the kids (around age 10) were watching the GPS more than the video, and were disappointed she took it down."
5,Great in the ATL,My husband and i brought this for our trip to Atlanta. It worked great! No more arguing over which Peachtree street the hotel is located on.
5,amazing device,"This is by far the easiest to operate and most accurate gps unit I have ever used - leaps and bounds ahead of in-dash units from ford, nissan, land rover, and infinity. Businesses are easy to locate with just a name- telephone numbers are included so I can call to be sure they are open.It easily fits in my pocket - about the size of 2 side-by-side cell phones. The battery has a long life. User interface is very easy to use.Be sure to store it in a safe place - mine was stolen from my car with the break of a window. I am buying a new one and in 5 months the price has dropped $200!!!! a must have."
5,Garmin Nuvi 350,"this device is really good!its very compactible, small, smart Im glad I bought this product"
5,amazing device for me,"I'm saving a lot of papers and time after get this wonderful device ,that takes me to places without problems,so far i'n using this GPS in Florida at this point there is no problems at all,i recommend it to everyone,FG"
2,directionally impared,"I purchased this item from amazon and got great delivery. I took the unit outside and within a few minutes it was set up. I decided to go to the post office about one mile away. This unit directed me to every side street with stop signs and when I got near to the PO, it told me to keep on going. I did not listen. Upon leaving the PO, it sent me back the better way but insisted I turn into my neighbors driveway across the street! I bought this to use with my travel trailor which I do not need to be misdirected at all. I sent it back the next day. The two stars were for the easy setup and quick obtaining of the sat's."
3,"Good , not great","Overall , I liked it .But I wish it was better. I am not comparing this with other GPS because I haven't used any other stand-along gps.I liked the fact that it reads the street names.The time it takes to start (load-maps, get satellite signal,and calculate the route) is unpredictable, even if you are in an open area. It can take anywhere between 30 sec to 2 mins in my experience.That can be frustrating if you are trying to reach some place in a hurry.I wish the user interface was better. For example ,it would be nice if it autocompleted what you typed.I would have also liked seeing the speed limit of the road, that could have been a feature which people could turn on/off as they wished. The mio gps has that feature."
2,Nice GPS; now sadly downgraded by new screen,"The Nuvi is great. Or I should say, was great. It used to have one of the best screens out there, as you can read in many of the 2005 reviews. But that's changed, and the new screen is a downgraded high glare one. I confirmed this with Garmin customer support. Unfortunately, they did not reduce the price when they reduced the specs. The navigation works great, and if you don't try to read the screen in sunlight you'll be fine. I don't think it's worth the high price - unless they return to the original, better screen. We can hope."
5,great product,"This pocket navigator is better than advertized, the ease of use is remarkable, easy updates via the internet. The sound quality is wonderful. The size fits easily in my purse when out of the vehicle."
4,very reliable,"Right after I received Nuvi 350, my wife and I took a trip around the U.S. Most of the time we relied on this device in getting around in metrpolises such as Los Angeles and Houston. It helped us locating nearby restaurants, attractions, gas staions, etc. The only downsides, though, are the following: (1) it consumes a lot of battery power. If you are planning to drive for more than 3-4 hours, you will have to keep it plugged into the lighter socket of the car.(2) The device is sometimes slow in giving directions;hence be prepared to get lost. (3) at times it is confusing.This happened to us when we were in New Orleans. It displayed roads and exits that were not existent on the actual map. For that reason, it took us about 45 mins to get out of Downtown toward Highway. I cannot compare this Nuvi 350 with any other GPS since this is the first GP I have bought. Regardless of the disadvantages stated above, I would highly recommend this device to any GPS first-time users."
5,Another good review with Ideas,"First GPS, I had it for about 6 months, been from NC to NY. Updates no problem, using windows XP. Seems very well built. I wanted the small screen because its mounted on the windshield.SWEET:1. Many different voices to chose from.2. Mount has the power connector, and stays put.3. Automatic day/night display mode.4. Push the map around using touch screen, like Google maps.5. Free update, you have 3 months to useDRAG:1. Latest update behind about 6 months.2. When it says shortest route, it's not kidding. Going up I95 to NY, had me taking Pennsylvania Ave through DC at rush hour, WOW the wife was pissed.IDEAS:1. Needs to calculate several top routes and let you decide which one you want to take. Otherwise it keeps saying recalculating at every exit.2. I wish Garmin would put more behind their software instead of having 20 different types of the same thing."
2,GARMIN NUVI350 GPS,THE GPS WORKS FAIRLY WELL BUT SUCTION CUP THAT GOES ON WINDOW DOES NOT HOLD VERY WELL FELL OFF THREE DIFFERENT TIME SO DON'T USE IT ANY MORE IF I WERE TO BUY ANOTHER ONE I WOULD LOOK FOR ONE THAT HOLDS BETTER. WILMA BAGBY
2,Download maps,"I have as yet to use the Garmin...I have tried three times to do the update download of maps.Supposedly should only take a couple of hours since I have DSL.I actually left the system up for 14 hours one time !!!It gets into about 60 - 70% and simply ""locks up"".I have the unit laying beside my computer when and if I get around to spending several hours waiting for the complete download !Disappointed? Yes !"
2,Product good but satelite reception is bad initialy,"this product features are very good and once you got satelite reception it works goods.i am living LA area still getting satelite reception in the first phase of my travel is very deficult, that dissatisfy meso I would rate the produt bad"
3,Acquiring Satellites... will find them in 4 hours.,"Perhaps I have been given ""lemons"" twice now. But with the Garmin 350, it only seems to last me 6 months or less before it becomes unable to acquire satellites. I have to revert back to my old ways of calling for directions, or looking them up online. I have spent much time on the phone with Garmin-- and they are very reluctant to agree that there is anything wrong with their product. So, before sending out replacements, I have to spend hours troubleshooting with them. It never works-- they end up sending a replacement anyway, and who has the time to spend hours troubleshooting every so often?I want to switch."
1,Will not turn on,"I bought this product through Amazon in July 2008. Today, January 25 it stopped working. Will not come on when there is a power source and the website is a nightmare to navigate. I will never buy a Garmin product again. They want 175.00 to fix it. Big piece of garbage!"
1,Garmin Nuvi 350 was defective,"I bought the Garmin Nuvi 350 after the Garmin StreetPilot c330 that I had been using for over a year got stolen. I decided to stick with Garmin because I loved my StreetPilot and never had any problems with it. I always found a satellite signal very quickly and never had any problems finding locations(even in Canada). I had problems with the Garmin Nuvi 350 from day one. I rarely got a satellite signal and if I did I was usually halfway to my destination already. The battery life was terrible and many times it lost battery power and turned off before I was given a low battery warning. Finally, after 3 months of use the touch screen froze up and it was impossible to use and I returned it. I may have a received a defective unit but overall I was very disapointed in the quality of the Garmin Nuvi 350 and would not recommend this model to anyone."
3,garmin 350,"This GPS device will get me to most places with litle difficulty. There are a couple of problems. 1. The directions get me close to the destination. I may need to travel as much as a half of a block to get to the correct address. 2. Some things like gas stations no longer exist. 3. It consistently routes me to interstates. Sometimes I know a more direct route and will travel it. Even with these problems, I get where I need to be."
4,GPS is good - POI needs updates,"The unit serves its main purpose for me which is providing pretty decent directions 95+% of the time. However, it seems like most POIs are added, but old ones are not removed. For the price of GPS units, the manufacturers should invest in a central database that the general public can assist in updating. Perhaps if 5+ people say a certain POI no longer exists, remove it. If the same number of people confirm a new one, add it.Anyway, I'm still pretty satisfied with my purchase.I almost thought I had a defective suction cup. Living in Phoenix, AZ, the heat dries up the moisturizer or whatever is originally put on the rubber piece and was falling off my windshield after 30 - 60 minutes. Then I applied some household oil all over the suction cup before sticking it on my windshield (like what you'd use to lubricate a shredder) and I have not had an issue with it falling off since. Oil obviously won't dry up."
4,Great companion on the road...,"I have this product for a month now and so far I have enjoyed it. I don't have to worry anymore about the places I want to visit, the nuvi 350 just takes me there. The unit acquires satellite signal fast in about 3 minutes or less (that's cool!). The mp3 player is also a plus, good sound but not better than my car stereo. I guess this is the only Garmin GPS that comes with the important accessories needed like the AC charger, car charger & case. No need for additional purchase, well worth the price. I upgraded the map to the latest version, the 2009 map navigation. It worked well, the only drawback was it took so long for the download, 2 hours. But overall, I'm satisfied with the product. Perfect for my Matrix XRS. I just hope it won't lead me to the wrong direction someday."
2,Software is out-of-date,The software is terribly out-of-date. I'm probably going to return it to Amazon and shop for a GPS that has up-to-date software.
4,Great performer,"I've had more expensive units on rental cars that did not work well, but the nuvi 350 has been a great performer. The maps are excellent and the screen is very easy to see. Sometimes it does not provide enough warning of an upcoming turn, but overall this was well worth the money."
3,Garmin 350 mediocre,"The Garmen 350 download didn't work properly on the first try. There is no way to get a second try. No tech support on the weekend. Doesn't give street names for county roads. (County roads not often marked). Voice difficult to understand. Directions regarding map loading do not exist or are hard to find.Having said all that, it is useful and kind of fun. And a decent price on Amazon."
4,Nuvi 350,"I was surprised by all the features offered, calculator, languange translator, currency exchange rate calculator... I like that I can use it without mounting it since the ""smash and grab"" makes me dubious about mounting it in the car. Good value for the money."
4,"Pretty darn good, but I have one complaint.","My only complaint is that it refers to some roads by names that nobody knows.... like route 422 in PA is not known by many as Veteran's Memorial Highway... It is Route 422, but the Garmin doesn't always call it that."
5,Nuvi 350,The Garmin Nuvi 350 was everything it was stated to be. Easy to set up and very reliable in its performance!
3,not current map included,Have three garmin 350s and when I received my fourth it did not come with a current updated map and i was directed to their web site to pay for an updated version . This was my first time ordering it thru Amazon and my first BIG DISAPPOINTMENT
5,Oh so easy. This thing is great.,"Wow, life is easy with my Nuvi. I have a brain injury and cannot remember how to get to places. This thing is awesome to put it mildly. A friend needed help in Upper Mich, I'm from Central Wi. I punched in his address and off I went. I am terrible about learning new things because of my injury but this thing is so easy. I am pleased to feel at ease again while driving that I wont get lost."
4,Pretty amazing technology.....,"This device is really amazing and very useful. Only ""beware"" I have to tell you: It is only as good as the person using it, so make sure you input the correct info, don't assume it can make arbitrary decisions to decode what you input! Ex. We drove about 25 miles out of our way returning to our motel on a recent trip because we input ""motel"" then picked the one we thought was ours without checking address carefully. Got a nice tour of Tampa Florida before deciding something was not right...."
3,Nuvi 350,"a Nice GPS with limited features. Great for unknown routes, but nothing available for SD storage routes. Travel kit is no longer available thru Garmin for this model. Otherwise love the simplicity."
5,Travel? You need this!,"Like mobile phones, this is one item you will wonder how we survived without one. Get it now, and you will not have to stop at a gas station for directions. You will thank me later."
4,LOVE IT!,"I just moved to a large city and bought this to help me navigate- I LOVE IT!!! I can just pick it up and head out the door and not have to do a bunch or research about where I am going or cart around a bunch of maps.The one negative is that I find there are certain places ""missing"" from the searches- such as I looked up a gas station and there was one on the corner that just didn't pull up in the search. Also happened with a restaurant I was trying to find. SO- it is a little bit of a nusance, but wouldn't cause me to not purchase it!"
4,easy to operate,"My husband ordered the gps. I really like it because it is very user friendly. This is the first gps my husband has had that I can use. It is very portable. If I went on a trip without my husband, I would be glad to use it!!!!"
5,never get lost with a Garmin,The product turned out to be everything I had hoped. It was very easy to use. I tested it in a city I was unfamiliar with and it worked very well. the battery lasted for over two days without needing to be recharged. Its small size made it convenient to carry. I also like the 'detour' feature that finds an alternate route if traffic is bad. This is a good product though a little more expensive then I wanted.
2,Garmin GPS Nuvi 350,The screen could be bigger and the directions to how to use the GPS is very limited. The mount for the car is diffult to use and many times it takes very long time to track your current position?
4,Good enough,"This is my first GPS. So I cann't compare with other brands. Except the fact that extra money should be paid for updating maps, it is good enough for me."
3,Can you see it?,"Have had a Nuvi 350 for a couple of years and though it can do remarkable things for such a small unit, there are a couple of major disadvantages. First, If the sun is shining the screen is nearly invisible. Great at night or on cloudy days. Second, The viewing angle is so narrow that the unit must be aimed directtly at the person viewing it. Driver and passenger cannot see the screen at the same time.Suggestion: If buying ANY GPS insist on taking it outside into the sunshine to see if the screen is visible."
2,Works till it breaks,"I bought this product for ~$450 in Feb 2007, and it worked till now very well. We have traveled extensively on the east coast and the west coast and this unit was a great accessory on our trips.But very recently the unit froze, it fails to connect to satellite. Upon further research I found that this is a very common problem and the only solution is to return the Unit for repairs.I am returning the Unit, since I am out of warranty they wanted to charge another $50 for repairs but they waived it off.I don't expect such an expensive thing to get these kind of problems just after 1 year. And it is not just my unit, many other people are getting such problems.Even 660 and 360 have these bugs."
3,It's Okay,"I had a Garmin C340 that I absolutely loved. It has trouble holding a charge so thought I would buy a newer model. I like the fact that it's small and easy to carry in my purse.The one thing that I don't like about it is at times it will tell me to turn on roads that don't exist! This has happened a number of times. In addition, it doesn't always take you the shortest route. I was going to an address that I had no idea where it was. Used the Garmin to get me there. Upon my arrival at the address, I found that I was somewhat familiar with the area. The Nuvi 350 took me on a route that ended up being about 20 miles when actually the address was 8 miles from my home. It took me back home the short route...strange. And yes, I updated the map.All in all I would recommend the C340 over this one. One thing is for sure, I can't live without my Garmin!"
4,Good Device,"I could write a lot about this device but I will try to keep it short. GPS is the greatest thing that has ever happened to my driving, but its got some drawbacks. I can leave the house with no directions and only an address and know when I'll get there and how to get there, but sometimes there are several listings for one address and they are all in different places, also it will want you to make random u-turns, and you take your eyes off the road a lot to use and read the device. But the majority of the time its right on and if the directions are simple enough you can get there without having to take your eyes off the road. This is very easy to use, very reliable, and helps a whole lot. Amazon has it cheaper anywhere else and its totaly worth every penny. I wish Garmin had an easier to understand update site for support and map upgrades, its very confusing."
5,2 week's experience with the Nuvi 350,"The Garmin Nuvi is easy to use. The touch screen is simple but the alphabetical (versus QWERTY) letter layout takes a little getting used to. I have used it in OR, NH, MA and FL and find that it make my sales-call travel much mor efficient. The battery lasts a long time, the voice is understandable and I have no trouble seeing the map, day or night. I am continually impressed."
4,"Great Device, Needs Manual Included",Great device and price but it was given as a gift to someone who really needed a manual and doesn't have access to the internet. Something in this price range and with this many features should have the manual included or at least included as an optional purchase at the time you purchase the unit.
5,Saved my sister's backside...,"This little gem has already paid for itself when lent to my sister for a trip to the outback(Ohio). Once she got off the freeway, she would have been lost in the corn without it. Not only did it provide directions there, it got my wife to gas and sushi while in ashville, NC. If you don't know my wife, I can assure you this was no small feat. It's ability to show high quality images is limited and I haven't had it long enough to test it's MP3 capability, but for what I bought it for(less panic calls from the wife), it has been spot on!"
4,I like my gps,"This is my second garmin gps and so far I am a satisfied customer. No product is perfect but the most important is it does the job done. I like this better than my pda-gps because of the compact size. With garmin, I have never lost so far."
5,Garmin NUVI 3.5 Inch GPS Navigator,The Garmin 350 is very easy to use. My wife can use it and she doesn't like new electronic type equipment. I have used it to find a resturaunt in Indiana and it took me right to it. I would highly recomend for any one purchaseing this item to also purchase the bean bag mount where it will just sit on the dash. It is much easier to see and remove from the vehicle than the one that comes with it and sticks on the windshield.
4,"I like this product, but it fails me sometimes.","When I purchased this product, I did not know you had to buy map updates. I downloaded all items that were free from[...]. However, the GPS often makes mistakes and I do not understand this. In certain areas, it does not work. It boggles my mind when I put in a Hospital for instance and it takes me to an empty field. Or, it takes me past the address I want. I am confused and perplexed. Am I supposed to buy map updates? There was no manual, so I do not know. Can anyone help me understand? [...] Thanks, Sam"
3,Compared to Navigon 5100,"I bought a Garmin 350 and a friend bought a Navigon 5100 about 2 years ago. The Navigon is one half the price of the Garmin. Both are pretty much the same except the Navigon directs you around traffic. It's amazing and it really works.Garmin now keeps asking me to update my software for $75.00. When my Garmin become obsolete, I will get rid of it and buy a Navigon 5100 for $120.00 and have the live traffic update and software updates for free!"
4,Beware - You could get addicted,Amazing Product. I am turning blind to routes and road signs.I totally rely on this for all my trips even a few miles away from home..Only issue I had was with the GPS holder (one star less). It does not hold on after a few months of usage..Other than that a highly addicting product
3,big mistake,"I've had other gps devices before i decided on this one...which is one of my biggest mistakes. As opposed to other gps systems, you have to flip the antennae on this one to get a signal which negates its supposingly compact size. I thought it was gonna be much smaller to carry around, but with the flip antennae, its such a nuisance....wished i kept my old one......"
1,Not working after 9 months,I bought this item from Amazon on July 2008. By March 2009 it stopped working. I wouldn't buy this product again.
4,"Easy to use, but","After reading multiple reviews of the various competing GPS systems, I bought the Nuvi based upon slightly more favorable reviews than the competitors. After using it for a month, I can only echo what others have said: the only real problems come with the points of interest. I have had several situations where I have been directed to very erroneous spots based upon the name of a place (such as XYZ school, or ABC restaurant). Generally, addresses will get you much better directions though it was unable to find my own home -- in which I have lived for 15 years -- based upon the address; close, but not quite!"
5,"Life changing,","In the future, I believe that people will ask how in the world anyone lived without these. This version in particular is perfect---easy to set up, easy to understand, perfectly clear on the road......like magic."
4,Garmin - Best option after the research,"After many months of researching GPS devices I settled on the Garmin Nuvi 350 and am glad I did. The directions generated as well as the accuracy has been amazing. It does have a little trouble in downtown area's with large buildings. I have used it in both NYC and Chicago and find that if I start it before I enter these areas it is ok, but if I start it downtown it takes longer to pinpoint my location as well as getting confused while navigating a bit, but if you give it time it will lock on and generate an appropriate route. This has not deterred me from giving a 5 star rating as the rest of the time it performs marveously.The screen is clearly visible in direct sunlight as well as at night, when the unit automatically switches to night mode. Text to speech is a must as well as easy search options for finding your location. I have yet to enter a POI that was not found by the unit. A great buy for the right price."
4,First real use of Garmin Nuvi 350,"Bought for use on vacations. On first use in CA, I realized its use was not as intuitive as I thought. During city driving I made several wrong turns because I misinterpretted the verbal directions. During highway travel the prompts to exit were much later than I expected; I almost missed several exits. I suggest that one use this unit in known places before using it in unknown places. Overall, I'm glad I bought it."
5,The GPS to rule them all,"I own a Garmin i5 for over a year now, and I've been quiet satisfied with the unit until I got the Nuvi 350. What an improvement it is over the i5. The first thing I noticed was how fast the 350 acquired satellite signal even when I'm indoor; this is something the i5 couldn't do. From there the list just go on : larger screen, touch screen, better mounting unit, rechargeable battery, slim, audio book, mp3 player, and one of the must-have features: the 350 actually speak out the street name! With the i5 sometimes I have to look for the street name on the tiny screen to make sure I'd make the right turn, and this distract me from the driving. The 350 actually says the street name so you can keep your eyes on the road. Look no further, the Garmin Nuvi 350 is the GPS to own."
5,We love our new GPS!!!,"This is a wonderful product. It works right out of the box, easy to use. The GPS comes with a AC and DC adapter. We just lve this product. We purchased the mount kits to go with our GPS so we could use it in different cars.Garmin Portable Friction Mount for Garmin GPS Units (010-10306-00)Garmin Automotive Mount for Nuvi (010-10723-04)"
5,Just Great,"Great service from Amazon. Received this item in time for Xmas. This GPS is very simple to get started even without viewing the instructions. I purchased the 360 with bluetooth and can't believe how easy it was to pair with my phone and download my address book. Amazing. This was extremely usefull on our trip to Charleston, South Carolina. We wanted to go on a plantation tour, so I searched the GPS for historical locations. Found the place we wanted to go. Their telephone number comes up along with address. I just hit the phone icon and the unit called the place, we reserved our spot on the tour, got in the car, followed the directions and bingo we were there. Great unit. Even used it walking around Charleston to locate restaurants and attractions."
4,Garmin Nuvi 350,"I bought this for my dad as a Christmas present, and it worked great right out of the box. The only thing I thought was a little strange was that it came with no manual. There is a Quickstart guide included, but if you want a manual, you have to download it from the internet. We took it on a test drive to a location that my dad knew well, and he took a shortcut that was different from the way the Nuvi directed us, it immediately recalculated, and took us the rest of the way on the route that my dad was planning to use. The voice directions it gives you are easily understood, and given well in advance of the turn."
5,Perfect for my 85 year old dad,"My family chipped in to buy this for my 85 year old father for his birthday. He loves it. It works. The sound and graphical interface ane very adequate even though I was concerned that the screen might be too small for him to see and operate. He has had little trouble learning how to use the nav features and if he can use it, anyone can."
2,Not very good for the price,"I bit the bullet and bought this because of the positive Amazon user reviews. But I'm rather disappointed with the Nuvi 350.1) The screen is not very bright, especially when driving on a sunny day.2) The screen is not very sensitive to the touch - frustrating!3) The ""stereo"" speakers really, really, really suck!4) The routing algorithm is slow.5) The GPS antenna does not work well when you turn on the unit while driving at the same time - sometimes it never picks up enough signals.6) The unit has crashed a couple times in the last two weeks.7) The fit and finish feels cheap and ""used."" (But Amazon assures me I received a new, never opened unit.)8) The computerized speech is not very clear - and the speakers suck!!!If this were selling for $300 or so I'd be much happier. But for the $465 I spent not including shipping, I'm very let down."
5,Very Pleased,"I did a great deal of research before I decided to order the Nuvi 350 from Amazon. I am very pleased with both the product and the delivery from Amazon.Right out of the box, I registered the 350, got the map updated to 2009 by Garmin, and began using it based on the quick start instructions. It worked fine and directed us to every place I applied it to. I should report that I was using it in and around our location in Alexandria, VA to test its accuracy. The 350 even directed us on to a HOV lane because it was open to all and the speed limit is higher than the regular interstate.I also purchased the friction dashboard mount for the Nuvi and found that it worked perfectly for our Prius.I was sufficiently pleased that we ordered an exact duplicate for our son as a holiday present."
4,"Good, but not perfect","Right out of the box, we tried two business addresses which could not be located. When it works though, it works well. In making this purchase we missed the fact that updates (if wanted or needed) for the maps need to be purchased. Here is the response I received from Garmin on this issue:""The company that updates our mapping, Navteq, releases updates every 12-15 months. The latest update was just announced, and will be ready to order in August. The updates require an unlock code for the device for a fee of $75. Since you have registered your device we have your email address. There will be an email notification sent to you of the updates arrival. At that time you will visit our website, and go to Mapsource Unlock. You will need to follow the onscreen prompts to Unlock Update Disc."""
4,2 Years and still working,"I got this for my wife as a graduation present but I ended up using it most of the time in my Maxima but I also wanted it to be in the car if she needed it. The suction cup mount was always falling off on hot days and we would find the mount and the unit on the floor which is a pain and most of the reason that I gave it 4 stars. My other gripe is that some of the maps are not accurate and or current and I have been driving down a road and the GPS shows that we are in the middle of nothing.It's lived for 2 years with being dropped on the floor, left in the car for days on 100+ degree days, being stuffed in the glovebox for a few months, and being handled by a teenager who's 'bored' so I'll have to say that it does what it says it's going to do and is still is being used."
1,DO NOT BUY,"I just returned my Nuvi 350 (within a month of shipping date back to amazon).It worked very well the first 3 weeks or so. Then while on vacation in California on my way from Berkeley to Vacaville, it lost satellite signal.It never gained back satellite signal that whole day until I got home again. Ever since then over 90% of time it froze up because of no signal at all or poor satellite signal even out in the open. It basically became useless since then. I tried reset and even discharge/recharge the battery. Nothing worked."
5,Can't live without it now,This is absolutely a must for anyone who is always lost or just to find a doctors address in town and where it is at. Saved me many times
4,Great GPS--no more map quest.,"After much deliberation I went with the Garmin as it had the best reviews of all the systems. I think the NUVI is worth the premium over the Street Pilot series as it is a much nicer and compact package. We are able to travel with it on the plane and walk on the streets without any difficulty. They all come with the Text-To-Speech which keeps me less dependant on viewing the screen. The screen size is more than adequet and the reciever is sensitive enough that we can keep it by the gear shift and it will still catch the satellite signal--something I have heard the tom-toms are not able to do. Suprisingly, my Garmin 350 is able to locate new bypasses that just opened after its manufacture date. The battery life is approx 7 hours by my estimate. My only major complaint is the quality of the voice can be better. Overall, the MUVI is high recommend..as it is very portable and now all our cars and family members can share it the security of a GPS device."
3,Not perfect but good enough,There are a few inaccuracies that sometimes I make the wrong turns or missed some of them because the maps do not coincide with what I am actually in. One time I was being made to make a left turn to a street where there are three (3) signs prohibiting it. Should not be relied on in routes you already know very well.
4,great little gps,"got this unit a month ago. used it to travel out of state already. direction was very accurate. it is the size of a cigarette, nice and compact."
5,GREAT NEW PRODUCT,"This is my fourth nav system. The other three were factory in dash units. I was a little leary about a portable unit, was I wrong. The Nuvi 350 is much faster and just as accurate as my car units. It is even easier to use. I saved a ton of money because Amazon discounted the price and I got free shipping and no tax."
4,Where does it say anything about the antenna?,"I just opened my box with the New Nuvi. No manual, but a small fold out with some very brief instructions. I just want to see how to get somewhere! Why does it think I am in Kansas? So quite a few minutes later I find a small paragraph that I should look at on its web page. There I find it has the 79 page manual that tells me that I have to lift the small flap on the Nuvi. The Flap is the `Antenna'. So now the satellite can find the Nuvi,,,and where I AM NOW... Garmin predisposes that everyone has a computer to be able to use the device.............What a way to save paper, does everyone know how to use a GPS unit?"
1,BE AWARE!,"Just talked to their customer service, they DON'T give free map upgrade to any previous purchase even within 1 day old. They just guarantee new maps when purchased."
1,Died after 7 months,"Product worked great, then after 7 months it just stopped working. The stand it came with was poor and had trouble mounting. I drove with the garmin next to me at times. I am in the process of checking out the warranty process...stay tuned."
4,I am happy I have a Garmin Nuvi,"The Garmin Nuvi is relatively easy to use, but there was a learning curve. Without reading the directions you can be up and running fairly quickly even if you are not technically savey. I did find that the directions were sending me in the opposite direction at first, but that had to do with the antenna not being up and able to connect with the satellite. I like the map views and the voice directions as well as the written directions. I love the size."
4,gets you their,"I am really enjoying this little thing. (It's not too small that it bothers me, i think the size is perfect)If you already know where you are going and try ""testing it,"" it seems that the route it chooses isnot always the best choice. Slow infact. BUT if you don't know where you are going it will always get you therein a clear, well prompted confident fashion."
5,Great Product,I would recommend this product. It works very well. A little slow finding a satellite but once it does it responds very quickly to wrong turns with an almost instant alternate route. I had the Magellen 3225 which I returned because it always wanted you to make a U-turns or was very slow in responding to an alternate route.
2,Not as fast as the 660,"This item appears to have been used, repackaged and sold to me as new.I have the 660 as well and it outperforms the 350 in satellite acquisition time as well as route recalculation time."
4,Nuvi Navigator,"This is an excellent tool for the traveler. I just started in a new territory and could not have performed this job without it. Graphics are clear. However, there were a few roads not loaded into the system.Other than that, I rate this product 4 stars.Ann in VA."
2,Uses old maps,"My subdivision is 4 years old and appears on Google Maps, Mapquest, and Yahoo...but not on this Garmin Nuvi 350. It cannot find my house, the subdivision, or the tollway to it (which has been open for about 2 years). I have connected the unit to the Garmin web for the latest update...none available. If you travel or live anywhere that has undergone change or addition in the last 4 to 5 years be advised that Garmin probably will not be able to get you there. On old established roadways it seems to do a great job. Hate to turn in a negative review amongst all of these positives, but 400.00 for a GPS that cannot find your own house is unacceptable."
2,Works great WHEN the maps are right,"I got this GPS with high hopes, I travel a lot and I am tired of printing out tripquest maps. I hooked it to my computer and downloaded the latest updates. Everything about the unit works great, it is easy to use, I love how it talks to you, easy directions, etc. However, at least in my area, the maps are wrong, worse than an online free map service. Just in town it was wrong three times in one day and on trips around this area of a 150 miles or so it was wrong each time. Maybe it works well in larger more urban areas but it isn't ready for primetime here yet. I returned the unit and of course Amazon's customer service was great as always. I'm hoping maps for these improve in the future as they continue to come down in price. I am very disappointed but I can't justify the price for something that is wrong so often. The bottom line is the map needs to be correct most of the time."
3,"Note that battery is ""nonreplaceable""","The Garmin 350 Nuvi comes with a ""built-in"" lithium-ion battery. It cannot be replaced by the user. Garmin's web site inidcates that the charge is $225 for any repair to a Nuvi 350 which presumably includes replacing the battery. Lithium-ion batteries seem to last at most a few years. This adds a considerable expense and inconvenience to owning the product.My Nuvi 350 was inoperable (it couldn't establish an initial location) when it arrived and is being returned. However, everything I have read or heard about the product both on the web and from friends who use it has been expremely favorable."
3,Garmin nuvi GPS,"The unit is simple and easy to use and work's very well. However, I am very disappointed that the map software it came loaded with is 4-5 years out of date."
3,good while is lasted,"The Garmin 350 operation was good for the 3 weeks I used it before it went defective. The screen went black after this period of time which of course was disappointing. I must commend Amazon for their quick replacement action. I went on line the day it went out and reported it defective and requested a replacement. I was given a return label at the same time which I printed. I still had the box it came in so I returned the defective unit. I received the replacement at no charge on the 6th after it went defective. For an out of town transaction, I consider this excellant service. Thank you. Alex Tapp"
4,Nice Features; Easy to Use,"I purchased this just before my NYC trip. Routing was perfect, recalculation (if I missed a turn) was quick and voice prompts were clear. The only reason I put it 4 star (and not 5) is the screen froze in one occassion. since the voice prompts were working, it was not a major problem. Reseting the screen was easy but required me to make a stop."
3,its very good but it should of be a bit more clear at local streets & some times it loos's sevice,a bit more clear at local streets & some times it loos's sevice this is about the item it self & about amazon my shiping was delayed a bit so.......
5,Never leave home without it,"I thought my husband was just driving me nuts for the latest and greatest ""toy"". I had NO idea it could do what it does and how much use we would actually get out of it. Not only does it help you with directions, it shows you gas station locations, restaurants, points of interest, etc. And, we don't even have to buy a second one for our other vehicle as it is mobile!"
4,Garmin nüvi 350 3.5-Inch,"I chose this product for it's portability and ease of use. Operation is extremely easy, and directions are very percise. Easy touch-screen operation allows for quick programing of routes. Routes can be saved in ""Favorites,"" for easy recall/re-use. Have not played too much with the ""Travel Kit"" features yet. Only drawback is that I have not figured out how to program or notify Garmin of corrections (i.e. locations changing names... Food Lion to Bloom). I assume there is a process that Garmin may have for this. I would also have LOVED an alarm clock feature for travel. All in all, after much research, I'm extremely happy with this unit. It fits my needs and does the job when I need it to."
3,Can't find my brother-in-law address,"i have own this product for about a week, It worked fine until i typed my brother-in-law address, altough i now where he lives i wanted to test this GPS. It couldn't fine this address in particular, it says : No matches Found.This unit has the latest map updates. Its not accurate when it tells me where to make a turn with the voice, you better watch for the highlighted road in the screen. It tells you to make a turn ... lets say... "" in 80 feet"", when the road is just in front of you.It does not find this address:639 Garden walk blvdCollege parkGeorgiaThis is an apartment complex by the way...But i like this: Fast satellite acquisition, Fast road calculation.i won't give one star because i think there is not a perfect GPS, and for the price it does its job.i will be aupdating this review as i use it some more..."
4,Garmin Review,This is a great mapping tool. I wish it told you how many total miles to your destination and that there were more gas stations and resturants listed in the unit. It would also be nice to search by attraction rather than only by address.I have great peace of mind knowing that no matter where I am at the Garmin will get me to where I am going. No more getting lost!
5,Garmin nuvi 350 is Great !,"I got a Garmin 350 for my self, and I love it. It is great. The best tool I bought for my self too get to my Jobs."
4,Retired travler,"It has been all it was advertised to be...They could have sent along an Instruction Book, after a phone call to GARMIN they sent me one.Better instructins would have been helpful, The bottom covers were a bit of concern, peal off or what?In a short time ""The ladies"" voice became a bit 'garbled', Customer Support had me changee over to ""The man's"" voice.A needless phone call if an instruction book had been included.JRW"
4,Great,"Bought this to take on vacation, worked flawlessly. It's quite handywith the preloaded maps, was a real boon in finding different restaurantsand attractions. It is at least as knowledgeable as I am about the localshortcuts etc."
4,Garmin nuvi 350,"First time I used it, the exit name was no longer what it was. I can only assume that the city failed to update their map. Other than that, this piece of equipment comes in handy when stuck in traffic and had to find a different route."
2,Quit Working the day before my tripxxxxxxx,"The Garmin would not turn on within the three days I had it....I even took it to one of my friends that also had one, and he could not get it to come on either.....I returned it and went on vacation the old fashioned way. stopped and asked a lot of directions....I returned it with no problems. Amazon was more than fair. They have since refunded my money, and now that, I've done more research on the Garmin, I will buy one with the wide angle. After all I wanted it to take with us on our trip to the Smokies, but it didn't turn out that way....I'm sure I just received a lemon, like so many of us do..I know of 4 people who also have the 350 and none of them have had any trouble with theirs...even though I had trouble with this one, I would not hesitate to buy another Garmin."
3,Simple GPS,"Pros1. Best for people who do not like much tech.2. Pretty Accurate.3. Lots of POIsCons1. Most important the voice is pretty feeble so if you like to hear music while the GPS is giving voice prompts, forget it.2. Does not remember the city in which you are so you have to always start with the city to enter the address in the same city.3. The GPS does not work when the Antenna is closed, so if you are planning to take it for a walk, keep holding it in your hand or something cause you can't fit it elsewhere.4. Loads pretty slow when you start it after shutdown."
2,Perhaps a faulty product!,"After reading wondeful reviews about this product, we decided to invest in one. Sadly, the Garmin was unable to locate a satellite with ease at our home. We would have to drive down our road and wait for a signal in order to program it for a destination site. We discovered that the commands were frequently too sudden and eventually the Garmin lagged at least a mile with its driving directions. When all else failed, it was delightfully helpful in finding us a nearby restaurant when we got lost but was unable to help us find ""home"".We were too reticent to purchase a replacement product and will do more research about another navigator."
4,GPS itself is great but the dash attachment!,The GPS is great but the dash mount attachment broke in less than two weeks! So now what it sits in my unused ashtray.
4,"Excellent device, but needs updates","I have had the Nuvi 350 for about 1 month now and I love everything about it. No more getting a phone book to find an address then typing into mapquest to get directions--it's all in this compact unit. I just took the family on a road trip to San Diego and it worked great. It got us everywhere we wanted to go. I like the way it warns you when a turn or exit is approaching so you have enough time to get into the right lane. We used it to find food, gas, etc on our route and it gave distances so we could get what we wanted when we wanted it.The only downside I have noticed is that, if because of new construction, the nuvi doesn't recognize where you're going it will try to readjust, however once it re-establishes that you are on the correct route, it will recalculate. And I noticed that there were alot more restaraunts on our route than what the nuvi showed. But those will probably be added with the next software release. All in all, this is a must have."
5,Great product!,"We bought this for my fiancee's daughter for her college graduation. She's moving to another state, and her sense of direction isn't too good. (i.e. needs directions to the end of the driveway!) This is a great little product. It's easy to program and use. We feel so much better knowing she has her Garmin GPS, and won't worry quite as much about her getting lost now!"
4,navigator navigating nanomiles,a very good product but the prompt should come a bit earlier as it tells u sometimes just at the turn!!
4,Good navigational aid,"The Garmin nuvi 350 is a good navigational aid that could become a great one if they'd update the map software to use route numbers, instead of highway names. When your're told to ""turn right onto Joe Jones Highway"", and the road is marked Route 1, it can be a bit confusing, especially in congested areas.Also, some of the pre-programmed information, such as local restaurants, for example, is outdated, or just plain incorrect.That aside, you get a lot of useful information and accurate navigational guidance for the money, especially at the Amazon price."
5,Nuvi rules,Garmin is moving away from the pack with a light user-friendly series of GPSs . The best all-around device today..
4,Excellent device,"I have been using this device for about 5 months and it is great. Directions are clearly spoken and with very few exceptions, accurate. On the 1 or 2 occasions that it was wrong, I was able to hit the detour button and get to where I was going.The only thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars, is that the windshield mounting device that comes with the product, is less than perfect. The unit will occasionally pop out of the mount on rough roads, and once or twice the entire mount came off the window.I'm hoping they improve this with the newer line."
4,Maybe a bug or two but still the best Portable GPS for the price,"I have used this on my recent summer trip (for over a thousand miles) and I dont know what I would have done if I did not have it. From downtown Manhattan to small towns in Virginia, Nuvi 350 helped me find my way (or I should say not get lost). I also had the travel guide installed (Which i recommend), so was a great help"
5,nice little gadget,The service by amazon was really good. Recieved as promised. Works well. My partner loved she could put pics and music. The only thing that it did not come with an owners manual. Just a quick referrence guide.
2,Nuvi 350: Not worth the money,"I had a TomTom One and was looking for something with a few more features so, after reading the reviews on Amazon, I took the plunge and bought one. However, I am very disappointed with the Garmin Nuvi 350. First of all, it takes FOREVER to find a satellite. This is very annoying. Second, once the battery is drained and needs recharging you cannot use the GPS functions while the unit is charging.! Are you kidding me? Who are the idiots who designed this thing? So there you are, in the middle of nowehere, and you can't use your Garmin Nuvi 350 because the battery needs charging. In contrast, my TomTom One can be used while it is charging in the car. Third, the TomTom user interface is much more intuitive and faster to navigate.Don't waste your money. I sold my Nuvi 350 but am keeping my TomTom. Note: I am NOT in any way affiliated with TomTom; I just think TomTom makes a better GPS unit."
3,Takes long to aquire sattelites,"Sometimes it takes 5-10 minutes to aquire sattellite, so need to wait. Makes mistakes on finding places, it says that you have arrived but the actual place is further or on the opposite side of the road. Sometimes tells you to turn left and there is no left turn, there is a bridge road above though but it doesn't recognize that. Sometimes it takes you longer ways to the place. Overall it's ok, but I think TomTom is more accurate even with bigger screens."
3,Good Not Great,"I have used a GPS from a different brand and when it broke I figured I'd try a Nuvi. First of all, the window mount is a real hassle. I never had issues with the other GPS, but every time I go to set up the suction mount I have trouble.There was also the time (after using it for around a month) I had it just setting on the dash board. I don't know if the vibration from the car caused it or what, but it just shut off. I was about 20 miles away from a Doctor that I have never been to in the Big City. Anyhow, I tried to turn it on and I couldn't get it to turn on for anything. It wasn't a battery issue because I charged it before I left. I tried plugging it into the charger and still, no luck! I ended up researching on line the next day to find out about the ""reset button"" on the back of the Nuvi. It works now, and I know how to get it working again, but I was pretty miffed when I was stressing out and had to call my wife to get directions on the fly."
5,NONE ALIKE,I have owned two different G.P.S.in the last year...WOW none like this..I have yet entered and address that I have not gone directly to the shortes route...the only thing I would have loved is to have the verbal comand option..other than that...none alike.
4,Top rated by Consumer Reports,"I bought the Garmin Nuvi 350 for my husband for Christmas and I couldn't have bought anything better! He loves it! We've used it quite a bit so far, to get around, find stores and restaurants and to look for a new home. He also downloaded hundreds of songs, one audible book and several pictures. He travels a lot and he took it with him on his last trip overseas. He keeps thanking me for giving him such a great gift! Too bad it doesn't play videos. Still, we are very happy with it. The only negative point is that while driving between El Paso and Dallas we tried to look for a gas station and the Nuvi couldn't find any on the highway. We had to wait for a street sign of what was coming up. We tried again as we were passing some gas stations and they were not on the map. Other than that, it's a great unit to have!"
4,A Handy gadget,"The Garmin Nuvi 350 is a good product for the functionality that it offers. I like the option of using it as an MP3 player. The only issue that I have with it that it takes some time to find the satellites, but I think it is a minor issue."
5,A GPS that does its fundamental thing CORRECTLY,"This is exactly the type of GPS I was looking for. Although it also comes with all the bells and whistles that are good for initial few days but find little use later on. But it is great when it comes to its fundamental functions: finds the best route, says the name of the street (eg, Turn Right on Edgell Road), does a recalculation in an instant, easy to use, has day and night mode, has the locations of lots of important places, is light, is sturdy, etc.It also has picture viewer, mp3 player but when I buy a GPS those are not the features that I am looking for. You have ipods or zunes for mp3 player and then you have dvd players these days."
5,Like an Angel!!,"I recently use the Garmin 350 on a road trip for the first time, while camping alone with my dog and it worked like an angel that was always hovering over my head guiding me safely along the way!!I think all females need to use this if we travel alone in this great big world!"
5,does everything it claims,One of those products that does what is says its going to with a minimum of fuss. Menus are very intuitive and easy to navigate. Only complaint is that there has been a lot of road construction in my area over the past couple of years and the maps have not been updated leading to potential problems if I don't consult a current printed nap
5,Great Travel Companion,"I purchased this product as a travel companion on my trips to various parts of the US. It is extremely easy to use and compact enough to carry it in my briefcase. I like the voice instructions which give street names instead of just ""left"" or ""right"". Overall a great product and I would purchase it again."
4,Garmin Nuvi 350 APS,"Easy to use, hear and see, while being small enough for use in close quarters.Downside--no time of day display; some advertised features, such as Tour Guide, custom maps, POIs are complicated to download, in the case of Tour Guide, very little available."
4,Great Product but tad too expensive,"Garmin has done a great job with nuvi 350 but can do justice by lowering the price a bit. Avoidances feature does not work that well, lot of room for improvement in that area. Becasue of that, at times it fails to provide an alternate route. I got two routes from google maps but 350 kept showing me one route. Overall, it is a great product but improvement in rerouting feature will make it excellent and unbeatable. Hence four stars to nuvi 350."
2,nuvi disappointing,"I received my Garmin Nuvi 350 only about 3 weeks ago. The car power cord has failed and the battery depleted during a trip.I used it to try to go to Morristown NJ only a relatively short distance from where I was staying. It lead me to a dead in street in Matawan about 50 miles away from the real Morrison.I couldn't program it to Tarrytown, NY at all.When in places where it worked, it worked very well and gives all kinds of info about restaurants, gas stations and great detail on local maps"
4,Garmin Nuvi 350,"Excellent functions and user friendly. Will fit in your pocket and operate for several hours without external power. Good for walking expeditions. Big fault- NAVTEQ Maps mis-locates my home address by 6 miles! NAVTEQ Maps also does not recognize many small towns or town lines or ZIP Codes or county lines. NAVTEQ Maps MAY not even recognize state lines, remains to be seen. Hoping for a mapping upgrade focusing on ACCURACY."
1,Would not buy this again,"Plusses:1. Screen is bright and controls are intuitive.2. Long battery life.Minuses:1. I have tested this locally, and found that the suggested route is not even close to the best route.2. The lists of restaurants are out of date -- some of the restaurants have been out of business for years.3. Sometimes you follow the suggested route and make a suggested turn, THEN it tells you that a better route was available -- rubbing salt in the wound from taking the ""bad"" route that it suggested."
5,Review Of Nuvi 350.,"This is the best use of money I have made for years, it's worth every penny,the information you recieve from the Nuvi 350 is unbelievable I use it every day and the type of work that I do save's me and my company time and money. Buy it you won't regret it."
5,GPS'd Bigfoot,"Got to tell you, I'm a Technocrap, anything remotely technological in my hands pretty much turns into a doorstop. But not this, took it out of the box, hit a couple of buttons, and it actually WORKED.Worked so well I took it with me on a story I did about Bigfoot in the Adirondacks where I followed a guide who said to drive to the end of North Lake Rd, AND THEN KEEP DRIVING for 10 miles, turn left at the big pine tree. Yeah that's pretty much what I thought...but this unit kept right up with it even when we got there and there was no here, there.Love this thing, now keep it in my briefcase at all times. Don't know if it will help you find monsters or not, but I will get you back and forth to where you want to go.And by the way I did use it to GPS where Bigfoot was supposed to have been, and the unit said it was at N 43 28.651' W 075 00.633' if you want to look for yourself."
4,good GPS,"Pros:Picks up the satellite signal very fast. Even works indoors.If you pass your route , the NUVI recalculates very fast. I would say within a few seconds.Cons:Doesn't come with any software program to enter personal address. You have to enter them by hand and if you reset the unit everything is lost. I wish the NUVI came with some sort of alternative mounting fixture for CA residents. I had to go buy a generic air vent attachment at best buy and zip tie it together."
1,GOOD WHILE IT LASTED...but 18 months later it is WORTHLESS,"Up until it stopped working I used to refer to this little device as ""the best thing I ever bought."" It stopped being able to lock onto a satellite and after following the tech support advice, it still doesn't work. Of course, Garmin was gracious enough to offer me a refurbished one for $175. THANKS BUT NO THANKS!!! You can buy a NEW one for $175. I WILL NEVER PURCHASE ANOTHER GARMIN TO REPLACE SOMETHING THAT SHOULD HAVE LASTED MORE THAN 18 MONTHS."
3,Failure to inform,"For unknown reasons, GARMIN discontinued this model some time ago. No reference was made to this in the 350 description. While performance on a recent 1,200 mile trip was satisfactory, it was unacceptable NOT to be told that the unit is, in fact, obsolete. Caveat emptor !"
5,Best value on a great product,Bought this 2 weeks ago. Very intuitive to use and compact enough to fit in a shirt pocket if used while walking. Announcing street names on turns is much better than just giving right or left turn ahead. Bought a 2gb sd card that stores about 330 mp3 songs. Thats over 20 hours of play time. You can get a FM modulator (I use the Iriver) and it will play thru your vehicle stereo system seamlessly.This is a great system.
5,Garmin Nuvi,We love the product! Garmin recalculates whenever you are 'off course' which is very helpful.
4,Nuvi review,"Easy to use -- often tracks the ""route least travelled"" which isn't bad, but not too sure it's best. Could have a few more instructions, but is fairly straightforward for using. Great size, great for travellers. I travel for business and it's wonderful to just pack it and go!"
5,Great little unit,"I bought the Garmin Nuvi 350 for my wife because she always said the TomTom unit I had was too hard to use. I find I like the Garmin so well, I use it all the time and the TomTom unit has been relegated to the shelf. The Nuvi routes well has a very good POI data base and has several rural roads that TomTom never did pick up. I'll never go back!"
1,Poor Acquisition of Satellite Signal,"I recently purchased the NUVI 350 from Amazon. I was very excited to use the product. In my first 10 drives with the unit activated it froze up at least half the time and could not acquire a satellite signal. The unit would have to be reset (located on the back of the unit) and then it would find the signal OK. When the Unit was working it was awesome and I regret that I am returning it as it can't be relied upon. If it was capable of locking onto a signal reliably, it would be an AWESOME unit. Maybe this one is just defective, but I don't have the patience to wait for another one and try again. Maybe also the fact that I live in the Pacific Northwest affects the satellite acquisition, who knows???"
3,nice and useful but not mac compatible,"I just got one of these units and I'm pretty pleased with it. My only complaint is that you need a PC to use the computer based functions (uploads, updates, etc) and that's pretty annoying. Luckily I can use a PC at work but it's such a failure of the last mile to not to make this thing compatible across both platforms.For this reason, I gave it 3 stars. Happy with it over all, for the money I expect way more though.Also, it offers ""travel features"" but not all of them come for free so it's a bit misleading."
4,"Good, not perfect","Does a good job of getting me form point to point (me-sales)without fuss or crashing. It is small with a nice screen.It shuts off by itself and turns on with no issues. Not sure how to control the volume.Does not seem to be able to select a diferant route or see which route it has scheduled. For my money, very good product at an excellent price."
4,be aware that you can only add one via point in a route,"if the GPS generates a route that you don't like, you can only change the route by adding one via point. Up to now I haven't figured out how to modify the route that the GPS gives me. TomTom has very good feature in this regard, you can choose avoiding certain section or pick certain via-point in a route, In that way you can really customize your trip. Garmin 350 doesn't have that feature at all. besides, the photo viewer and MP3 players are just stupid and very low end, they don't seem to be very useful for a GPS user. Other that that, it is a very good GPS unit."
1,Does not work in big cities,"I used this in Chicago and it was hopeless. It could not identify where I was and kept ""recalculating"" even though I was not moving. It kept receiving mixed signals and though I was right in front of my destination, it kept telling me to go round and round. The suction cup that came with the unit did not work and will afix to the windshield. It was a good thing that I had a friend and a map with me on that day. Do not buy!"
4,The best for the money . . .never get lost . . .,"I have known people who owned this, and when I was relocated to another town far away from my familiar surroundings, the first thing that came to mind was to buy this. I never get lost and if I do make a wrong turn (because I'm not following what it's telling me to do), it will redirect me. Amazon had the lowest price for this item that I found when I was researching where to buy it, and now I have advertised it to others who want to buy it. I feel a new level of confidence when I go to a new town or big city, and since I can always find my way around, it takes less time to find things than getting lost and driving for a while to look for certain destinations. I definitely would recommend this to anyone who was looking for a small and convenient GPS system."
4,"It does what you want, go for it","All the positive comments are in line with the quality, efficiency and overall expectations that you may have from these kinds of device. I found only one glitch that takes some time to get used to. When you approach narrow multiple intersections the drawing are not clear (or zoomed in) enough to give you a clear idea on where you need to turn. There's an option that changes the view and gives you a better prospective, if you don't use it, you're going to miss your turning point. Except that: good battery, good display, pocket size, the just amount of features, good price."
2,Great toy but very breakable,"I managed to drop one of these from a height of 2' and the screen was totally destroyed. Garmin understandably refused to fix it for free.I purchased a second one and all was joyous again. A friend suggested I bring it along for a trip so I put it in a case in my side pocket. When I pulled it out again the screen was horribly cracked. It was a tight but not exceptionally tight fit in my pocket and I find it incredible that this managed to destroy it. Garmin has also refused to consider this one for replacement under warranty.Overall, I feel like this product needs a little more ruggedization before being described as a ""Pocket Navigator""."
2,BEWARE! Navigator Battery is NOT REMOVABLE!,"The biggest drawback of this navigator is that manufacturer is still continues to make them with no access to the battery.So how it can be a PORTABLE navigator than?Let's say you are riding a bike or hiking with this navigator, and in 4-6 hours your battery run out of juice, and you STUCK in the middle of forest?That's not nice at all!Now if you could change a battery, you just put a fresh one, and you are on your way again!The other point - once you recharge the battery installed inside the devise for 500 - 700 times it will be almost dead and not to hold a charge.What it means for you - you have to Pay BIG BUCKS for TECHNICIAN to INSTALL A NEW BATTERY.GARMIN, COME ON, FIX THIS PROBLEM, than you might have an Awesome product."
1,Problems with the Garmin Nuvi 350,"We purchased it for a trip to Carmel and San Francisco. On the second day the Nuvi 350 lost all the POI's. Although it was very good to find the satellites on several occasions it did not know where we where and took us to the wrong location. Although I believe it had some internal problems, when it did seem to work correctly, it had a hard time correcting the route when we varied from it. I have had several other units and they immediately corrected and re routed. The Garmin seems to get confused. Also you should have a map because several times it told us to turn at a route it did not tell us north or South which made rerouting a necessity. I have dash Gps in my Dodge truck and it outperforms the Nuvi 350 ""Hands Down"" I think the Pocket Gps has a long way to go before it can perform what the dash mounted units offer and I will return this one and wait for more generations later."
2,Died after a year...,Great little gizmo...but it died after only a little more than a year. Not what I expected for the investment.
3,Keeps breaking...,"I bought my Nuvi last year, and while it worked great while it worked, its lifespan was somewhat short - after 11 months, it went mute on me. Whether with or without an external speaker, not a sound from the unit. I received a refurb from Garmin with a 90 day warranty. Today is day 89, and the touch screen no longer works. I understand that there can always be problems, but for a $300 unit, I would have expected a longer lifetime and definitely fewer issues. I am trying to get my unit repaired, but I am currently overseas and without a GPS at this pount..."
3,Overall good device with one really annoying feature,"The main issue I have with Garmin 350 GPS is that it doesn't tell you what your next turn is. This can be extremely dangerous. If your next turn is a right at the next exit, it won't tell you until immediately before - sometimes this can be terrifying. At this point, you are in the way wrong lane and you put your life at risk trying to get into the correct lane. Maybe Garmin has fixed this issue with its newer GPS machines; I've read a lot of other complaints on here about the exact same thing with this model. Tom Tom seems to work better in this respect - your next turn is always on the screen even if it's in 60 miles, so you can be sure to stay in the correct lange."
3,Refurbished not finding saltelite well,"I've bought this GPS and I wouldnt recommend it. The satelite takes too much time to work and usually the map doesn't find the locations I want to go. I have a GPS on my blackberry that is much better. I have to search on the Blackberry or Google, find the address and then the GPS will take me there. If I try to find the location by name, it is not working, Also I went from Decatur, Il to Peoria and to go, the GPS took me to the right and faster way but to return, it takes me to small roads and I lost a lot of time. I am trying to return it but since I bought from a Amazon Merchant, I will have extra cost to do it."
4,cheaper alternative to in-car navigation option,"As a business traveler, I can take this with me. If I chose the in-dash navigation option, not only would it cost nearly $2000, but I couldn't take it with me and use it in rental cars when I travel. The only negative is that you need to spring for an updated map every 2 years to the tune of $60...bummer!"
4,Garmin Nuvi 350 GPS Navigator,"Totally enjoy the GPS, this is an awesome product and really helps out the spouse, as they do not get the brunt of driving mishaps due to co-navigation crticism.Seriously, if it is portability we are looking for, then this device is great and also this has very high responsiveness, and accuracy.Very user friendly, the volume of the voice is limited, but can be overcome by hooking into the speakers of your stereo in the car, thru the MP3 Playback mechanism that you have put in place as you will like to play MP3 music thru this little gadget as well.Value for the price is awesome, highly recommend it."
5,Great Navigation System,I recently bought the Garmin Nuvi 350 GPS. It is great. I don't know how I lived without it. So far I have encountered zero problems with it. It is very accurate and the voice is great to let you know when you are approaching a turn. If you get lost easily like me then I definitely recommend this product. It is easy to use and the satellite is fast and reliable. It takes only a few minutes to get setup too!
4,"Perfect...err, almost","An excellent value for a GPS. It isn't perfect, but then what is! I have noted it seems to want to route me to an address or two (in town) via street names that simply do not exist in that part of town - in other words, it seems to properly identify where to make a turn, but sometimes will incorrectly identify the name of the street to turn onto. As long as you are aware of this quirk, then it works just fine. For ""on the road"" use it seems to work perfectly. I would recommend this unit to anyone who wants a good solid value."
5,My only regret is ...,"... that I didn't purchase this sooner!!!! I highly recommend this product for anyone that does any traveling. I'll never have to bother with MapQuest again. It also tells me what time I will reach my intended destination, finds gas stations and restaurants! I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!!"
5,Great Product.,Its absolutely wonderful and useful product. I have used it for a recent 10 day road trip and didnt find any problem in finding my way.
5,Great GPS and very user friendly!,I researched the best perfoming GPS systems then went to Amazon for a great price. I have had this product for a month and it is everything I read it would be and more.
2,Takes too long to connect to satellites,"This would be a great gps if it didn't take 5-10 minutes to connect to a satellite. Sometimes I get lucky and it connects within a minute or 2, but most of the time it takes at least 3-5 minutes. Sometimes rebooting it helps to connect, but not always.Aside from that it is a great device. Maybe it's just mine and I bought a lemon, but I would not recommend this gps."
3,Garmin GPS,"This is a handy device to have if you don't ""pre-route"" yourself through Google Maps or Mapquest. Over time I am using it less and less. The search feature is undesirable in that it takes so long to bring up a search sometimes. Even when the search destination is not that far away.A very annoying item tho is the fact that you have to pay for a ""Map Upgrade"" after a period of time. Computers and software are upgraded everyday without us having to pay for the same features already installed! A good thing to have in the beginning of a move or if you're a traveling salesman, but for now, it's just collecting dust."
4,Good solid gadget,"I had a chance to compare this old little gadget's performance to the once installed on some luxury models of new cars, and in my eyes it easily beats the competition. It always gives me a better route. The only complain I have, it could've been a little faster with triangulating the initial position of the car on start-up, and with calculating the roads."
5,great value - works for what I need,"Bought this on black friday last year and am still pleased with it. It's worked very well and I like the step by step options the best. this works very well for me and our kids can help locate things when I'm driving so I'd say it is pretty easy to operate.It also plays MP3's and used that feature on a flight and had plenty of power left. As an experiment, I turned it on while on the plane and it tracked that we were going 500+ mph. It even was able to identify the airport in Japan!"
2,Recharging,"The Garmin did show after pushing a few prompts what the exact direction were. However, the Garmin would die out after an hour or two. This is bad especially for long trips on the freeway. Secondly, if the Garmin needs recharging (while you are driving) you cannot see or hear the directions nor do you get visual. Therefore, if you need to turn, etc you might get lost.Garmin takes too many different processes to get something accomplished. I believe there are easier navigation devices."
5,Awesome GPS System,"This is the best GPS in the market in the under $500 range. The GPS is easy to use, the directions are accurate and the blue tooth functionality is very useful. Garmin GPS are simply the best!"
5,Best deal; easy to use; excellent accuracy.,Best deal for this model is on Amazon. More expensive than others but worth it. Easy to use;very accurate. Very compact-which is a plus when you take it with you. Quickly recalculates when another route is taken.
4,Wildly Optimistic Travel Times,"A nice unit - just like magic in it's navigation skills really. BUT...it has several user interface issues.The worst problem is it is wildly, stupidly optimistic in travel times and estimated time of arrival. I always have to add at least 10 to 15 minutes to its predicted journey time around here (metro Philadelphia/NJ/NYC).Probably because Garmin US is HQ'd in Kansas...(no traffic??) but whatever the reason it seems inexcusable to me."
5,GPS System Rocks.,"I bought this for my wife for her business, which requires her to drive around L.A. She loves it. She says it is on target 99% of the time, with miscalculations due to new construction."
4,"Love it, but....","The maps and, especially, the POI's are way out of date. Maybe it's a function of our rapidly growing area in NC, but many 2-3 year old road modifications and additions are not included in the latest update. And, the POI's--restaurants, hotels, etc.--can be quite interesting. Some are merely closed or changed, but a few (one of which which turned out to be an older home) never were. To be fair, this is not a Garmin thing: Virtually all mapping programs (computer or gps) use the same map data.Still, it is a fun and very useful tool--I even bought a second one for our second car. It has saved us many a time and its estimates of arrival times, even on long trips, are uncannily accurate. Just don't trust it implicitly; keep your eyes on the road signs and be ready to over-ride the Nuvi when necessary, especially where recent changes have been made."
3,backwards question,"I REALLY LIKE THE GARMIN NUVI, BUT WE HAVE TROUBLE WITH THE FACT THAT, IF WE ALREADY KNOW DIRECTIONS TO SOMEWHERE, OR WE ARE AROUND OUR DESTINATION, THE GARMIN EITHER TELLS US, OUR DESTINATION IS ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OR IT NAVIGATES US TO A LONGER ROUTE, EVEN IF I HAVE IT PROGRAMED FOR SHORTEST, OR QUICKEST ROUTE. IT SENDS US INTO A DEVELOPEMENT SOMETIMES. I KNOW I'M SUPPOSED TO TRUST IT. SOMETIMES IT IS JUST OVERALL WRONG!!!!"
3,Not yet there!,Overall a great concept and a very nice product. Generally speaking it was very helpful for locked in trips. After 1 week I tried to get to my destination from my current location and the Nuvi 350 never was able to get me there. It stayed at the original departure setting.To that point I will be waiting for the next generation to buy and keep one.Garmin is definitely the leader and the Nuvi is a very convenient pocket size.
3,It's a discontinued model! And do't buy the car adapter!,"I'd have appreciated learning from Amazon that this model has been discontinued, rather than stumbling onto that fact at the Garmin website today (8/13/08). I would also have appreciated Amazon refraining from telling me, when I ordered the unit, that ""many customers also bought"" a car adapter. I checked Amazon's web description, no adapter was mentioned in the ""included"" section so I ponied up the extra dough. Turns out, an adapter comes in the box.So the GPS itself seems okay, I'm just not wild about Amazon's sales practice - my first complaint with the company, ever, but one's too many."
1,Sending My Nuvi Back,"Very disappointing. Can't find a church near my home which has been there for 40 years. Can't find Wal Mart two miles from here, which was built over 2 years ago. Nuvi says closest Walgreen is 10 miles away while I am sitting in the parking lot of a Walgreen. Says no ""Bob"" in database although we just passed a Bob Evans and it lists the Bob Evans in my home town. And on and on. When is the last time these maps were updated?Definitely not worth $ 700."
5,Best gadget I ever had,"slick, lightweight and wonderfully accurate... just as one of the website says... 'insanely recommended'"
2,"goo, but could be better","General, 350 is good. But there is no manual come with the product. I checked everywhere to find a manual, but even the content list did not mention a manual. Finally, when I connect the machine to the computer, I found a manual. I tried to transfer some MP3 files to the 350. But it was so slow, I though the USB port must be a USB 1.1 port on the machine. I just don't know why such a expensive stuff won't install a USB 2 port on it."
5,Great buy. Good for car and walking,"There are a few issues like (1) sometimes slow GPS sync, (2) aging database, but it does its job well. And the MP3 player is integrated very well."
4,Viewing the screen a problem in sunlit environ.,"As is the case with most camcorders and digital cameras featuring a video screen, the data on the Nuvi 350 screen is barely visible in direct or indirect sunlight when mounted on the windshield. And since 90% of my driving is in daylight hours and since I reside in the Southeast US where the sun's brightness is significantly higher than in the northern climes, viewing the display is a problem. Only complaint I have. All other features are most satisfactory. Just wish I could see the data more clearly, at a quick glance actually, so my attention could be where it should be, primarily outside the vehicle."
4,Great Garmin,"I bought the Garmin Nuvi 350 for my husband for Christmas. So far so good, I mean GREAT! It's easy to use and understand. We used it several times on familar routes and it wanted to take us in a different direction. Once it realized we weren't going to follow its route, it eventurally took us the way we wanted to go. With more use, we'll probably figure out how to program it to go the way we want to. We just recently drove in some heavy fog, visiblity was very low at best. The Garmin's map with it's arrow pointing the way was a huge help in finding the way to our exit in the fog---I'm not advocating using it as an instrument panel for driving blindly in the fog or snow. Fortunately the fog we were in was short lived. The estimated arrival times were right on---to the minute! We both loved the fact it displays all the names of the roads, even the little side roads. The Garmin Nuvi 350 is a wonderful traveling companion."
5,An Incredible Product!,"This is one of the most useful electronic products I have ever owned! It is much easier to use and program than any of the GPS systems installed in my cars - and does so much more! Need a restaurant, gas station, or store? Just hit a button. The graphics are easy-to-follow and the voice is soothing. It is small and easy to carry. Highly recommended!"
5,Must be plugged in,A five-star quality unit with quick delivery from Amazon. Love the ease of use but wish it could be used without being plugged in... em
5,Good Gear for a Good Price,"A great piece of equipment for the price. I had been looking a GPS unites for while until I found the Nuvi350 on Amazon for a much lower price then any department store. It was easy to set-up and very ""user friendly"". I would recommend this unit to anyone."
1,DO NOT BUY YET! OLD MAPS!,You are NOT going to get a free map update! If you were told by Garmin tech support (as I was) that you could go ahead and buy the device with the v8 maps and you would be provided with a free map upgrade YOU WERE LIED TO! You were expected to notice (according to Garmin) that this long standing update policy had been changed. If you still insist on throwing your hard-earned money at a company that behaves this way at least wait until all the old stock has been flushed from the distribution system before buying and then only purchase from a retailer that will assure you that you are getting the new updated maps.
4,Review of Garmin nuvi 350 GPS Navigator,"I recently purchased this item and have only used it on 1 vacation trip. So far I am very pleased with this product. It is easy to use and performs as advertised. Besides showing you the route to take, there are many other pieces of information that it gives you, like calling out the street names, miles to go, time of arrival, and many others. The touch screen is very user friendly. Overall I am very satisfied with this product. I am also very satisfied with Amazon.com. The product was easy to order, arrived on time and was in great condition. The biggest benefit from ordering on Amazon was that I was able to save money. This item was more expensive in the retail stores."
3,Garmin 350 small and simple,"I bought it last month .I like the graphics as compared to my PDA based GPS.Very simple clear and concise. with some add ons which u may not need it.Excellent text to speech featurebad points -too pricy for these limited features,went to Boston got confused on small roads slow for recalculating routes as compared to DELL .Bottom line: Should buy it if you want something small and simple and you think garmin is the best.but if you want to save money there are cheaper ones with similar features like MIO;"
4,Good but I have seen better,"This product isn't bad. It take longer to acquire sattlite access than my boyfriends 260. It takes his about 6 seconds while my 350 takes about a minute everytime I turn it on. The directions are ok but sometimes it can not find businesses (like a local Walmart) that have been built for over 7 years. You have to know there eact address. Sometimes you can have the address but it will take you to an area where the business is not located but if you put in the business name it will take you to the front door.I had send my first one back because the battery went completely dead after only 2 weeks. The suction cup mount is not very good. Mine falls about once a day, while driving. Once again I did not have that problem, with my boyfriend's 260."
3,Good,"It's a good GPS, not great. Many times it will take you on the long route to somewhere. Another problem is if you ask it to find you something, i.e. a liquor store, it came up with them, but then the route took me to someone's house. Good product if you don't have to live or die by it."
4,Love our Nuvi!,"This gadget though pricey was a great investment. It has saved us so much time when traveling. It's great for finding the nearest gas station or food options available. I bought it for my fiance because we had dreams of geocaching and take quite a few road trips. Now that I know a little more about geocaching, I don't think this is the type of gps we'd need. We are so pleased with it for everyday use though. We don't care. I like that I can use it as a pedestrian (finding out of the way places when walking) and love that I can hand it to houseguests instead of having to constantly print out mapquests. My parents thought it was a godsend when they were visiting. And as frugal as they are were very interested in getting one of their own. The only downside is that sometimes the maps are outdated. A couple times it has asked me to turn at the next street when I'm on the freeway. Not quite possible. But I can always get back on track. A good gps will change your life. We love it!"
4,Garmin is good,"I received a Garmin Nuvi 350 through Amazon at a substantial savings to Best Buy, etc. Out of the box I was able to turn it on and use it to find a banquet I had to go to that night. I didn't even have to enter the address, I just entered the name of the banquet hall and it took me right there. There is almost no learning curve and it has not let me down yet as far as accuracy. This includes a recent trip to Colorado for skiing."
2,Adequate for the job,"Purchased this item to find schools within a 50 mile radius of our university. For the most part, it has done the job. However, a few times, I have been directed way out of the way. I have tried to download updates, unsuccessfully, from the website. Much of the information already downloaded was more than two years old, with many places no longer in existsnce. It will get you where you are going. But for the price you pay, it isn't worth the investment. I am disappointed."
4,"Some expected kinks, but overall a great product","My company uses these when we travel, but I travel so much, I decided to buy my own. It's extremely user friendly. I specifically like how it tells you expected time of arrival.Some minor kinks: It doesn't always tell you the best way to go (but then again what GPS really does?) So, I always be sure to look at a map for long trips first, so that I at least know the major highways I want to take (sometimes it tries to take you on smaller highways, backroads, and that makes no sense because the speed limit is lower and you hit red lights)Also, on really rainy cloudy days, it takes a LONG LONG time to load, so always plan for a few extra minutes for your GPS to get signal."
4,navigation,"I like this navigation device. I like that i can type in a name of a business and it will find it for me. I was in another state and found my bank, so I didn't have to drive around looking for one. As long as you change settings to fit your requirements -- it does great. If you want the fastest route it will take you through the big cities, not around them."
5,Garmin GPS,I bought the Garmin GPS for my husband for Valentines Day. It is great and it is very helpful when you are traveling. Highly reccommened.
3,Assemble is too clumsy,The assembly is too clumsy to handle(too many pieces). Beats the purpose of having a flat/thin display. Bulkier versions like c330 or 550 are much better. Slow in acquiring satellites and recalculations but generally decent value for money
4,Pretty good,"I've never had a GPS navigator and I really liked this one. I used the location functions for the nearest gas stations which help (especially when your low on gas and are unfamiliar with the area). I'm not too fond of the car attachment, though. A bit flimsy and it obstructs my windshield view."
5,good,"fast delivery, good gps for the price and day to day use for visiting new places, small and can be carried on the pocket. works as expected, although not as fsat for loading the maps."
5,Great GPS for the price with just enough bells and whistles,"This nuvi 350 model was the best deal out there for the features that I needed. I got one for my father who is 64 and he figured out how to configure it to his needs within 15 minutes, not to mention it is ready to use out the box. Just turn it on and you are ready to go. It is pre-loaded with the 2009 maps already and has TONS of interest points. I actually bought this since I was moving from Miami to Boston and I wanted this to navigate through the confusing Boston area. I used to on the road trip on the way up and let me tell you that it paid for itself right there. After getting tired of driving on some nights at 1am. I was able to find hotels in abundance near me and that saved the night. Overall I think unless you want a GPS to hold your hand and drag you to the location, this is exactly what you need."
5,Garmin Nuvi 350,"The Garmin Nuvi 350 is an excellent GPS for the money. I was origanally looking at the Nuvi 200, but for only 40 dollars more the 350 was well worth it. I won't bore you with what was good as I could go on and on with the that, however I would like to tell you a negative:When you try and avoid highways, you can not chose between Interstates and state highways. I was testing it and it wanted to take me out of the way through a neighborhood to avoid the state road I was on. I wish there was an option to avoid just interstates.That is my only complaint with the gps, any other issues are minor and to be expected.If you are looking for an inexpensive GPS for basic needs with a little extra the Nuvi 350 is it."
5,GPS upgrade,"Upgraded the old GPS (Garmin 320) after 3 years. The Nuvi350 is everything we wanted. New '08 maps, spoken street names, small enough to go in my pocket. Added bonus, it has a feature that allows you to save points by using the long/lat instead of an address. Now I know where my retirement land in NM is! Great unit. Garmin is the best company to deal with."
5,Great Garmin 350,"This was a birthday present for my 21 year old son ,we call him Mr. Gadgit. The Garmin 350 passed the test he loves it."
5,Well Worth The Money,"This thing is great for business travel, no more trying to drive and read a map at the same time."
3,It will get you there,"I just used my 350 up in Canada and it worked very well. Around town it seems not to use the quickest path even though that is what I have it set on but it will get you there. For the price I don't think you can go wrong, I like the size and ease of use. Overall I am happy with the unit and would probably buy it again."
4,Pretty excellent overall...,"Being a newbie to the world of GPS devices, it took a minute to get used to the Nuvi 350....and how it worked. But once I got that down, it was a lifesaver on my vacation in the Bay area. Right from the Oakland airport, it got me to my apartment rental in the Northbeach area of San Francisco, and helped me get around town, and around the entire area. It sometimes took longer than usual to lock in a satellite, especially in the hills of Sausalito and Tiburon, and one time lost connection in downtown SF. But overall, it performed beyond my expectations. I'll never leave home without it if I am going somewhere new!"
5,How did I ever travel without it.,"As this is the only GPS I have ever used I am unable to do any comparisons. I am able to say that this is a great device and makes traveling so much easier. On a recent trip across Texas my wife and I found the unit easy to use, accurate in giving directions (although it has a definite preference for interstate highways) and filled with useful information. There was no need to decide ahead of time where to stop or make reservations. Just ask the nuvi about upcoming lodging, call the phone number provided and procede. With this unit and a cell phone you are absolutely free to go anywhere with no worries about the route or destination."
3,Can be improved,"I recently took this to an intensive apartment hunting trip in Boston. Overall it was very helpful. The first complaint is that it shows the route in pink no matter it is the route you covered or to be covered, so if the street are not straight lines (as in the case of Boston, or it wants you to do a U-turn), you could be confused about which way to go. I wonder if by using changing colors, it can fix the problem. The second complaint maybe just an issue avoidable by a GPS unless you pay a lot to update all the time. Many times, it asked me to make a left turn when there is no left turn sign (maybe city changed the traffic rules.) Also when I went the wrong lane on a high way, it does not detect the mistake until the two lanes' routes significantly differ."
5,Very pleased,"This is a great product: easy to use, accurate information, many useful features. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a GPS device."
5,"Nuvi 350, a really nice addition to any vehicle.","The Garmin nuvi-350 is really neat. I have used other GPS devices in rental cars, this is just as easy to program for your destination, and from what I can tell this unit has uncanny accuracy. When you are driving, it can pinpoint your location to within 3 meters. The screens to input your destination are very easy to use, you usually do not even have to complete the name of the street before it appears on the screen for you to touch and enter. Overall I love this unit, I use it all the time, even on short trips,when I am going to a familar destination, I just use the map only feature, it is a fun accessory, and invaluable, if you have never been to a specific location."
4,Fun and Useful,"People are amazed by my DVD free Navigator. I am too. Not only is it helping me find my way around Washington DC, it is helping me on road trips. The maps are good. The only problem I've had is locating satellites around skyscrapers and new roads which of course don't appear. While you can put music on it, be warned that the speaker is not of great sound quality so it is better to just use your car radio. Also, because the speaker isn't that good, I've decided against using it as a translator. I tested the French and it is spoken too quickly for me to catch all the nuances. Consequently, I use the device only as a Navigator and it does that quite well. Also, you can't beat it's compactness. Finally, don't leave the car attachment hooked to the windsheild. Mine MELTED there and the rubber tore as I struggled to get it off the windshield. So, I had to buy a new car attachment already."
2,"Map is out of date, but update will cost you $75","I bought a NUVI 350 last Nov. It has problems sometimes (about 10-15%). Such as ""can't find the location"", wrong direction, wrong street names. I called the support, found that map and software are out of date, but I was told that I have to pay $75 to update the map. It is unreasonable for a product purchased less than one year."
3,Garmin Nuvi 350,"This was bought as a gift for my husband, who does like it a lot. Complaints are: battery does not last very long despite how long it is charged and up to a full charge; maps are not updated. This was a gift given Christmas 2007 and even roads built and finished within that year were not in the program. Updates of maps are ridiculously expensive."
1,Don't expect much,There have been many times the Garmin nuvi 350 has frozen up on me. I'll turn it off and on again hoping it will reboot but it doesn't seem to work. I can't even tell you how many times this thing has left me stranded. The last and final straw was a few days ago when it left me high and dry in the Yankee Stadium area of the South Bronx. Do yourself a favor and buy a compass instead.
2,Recalculating...,"- Twice in a week it told me to make a right whereas I was supposed to make a left (This was on my way home, so thankfully I knew which way to go!)- Twice a week it took me to dead end roads- Often times it takes the navigator about 5 minutes to acquire satellites- It can't acquire satellites if I'm driving on the highway- Often times it makes you drive through the stupidest routes (it does ""recalculate"" once you take a different route and makes a better choice)So...""recalculate"" if you really want to purchase one!"
5,Customer Delight!,"We are totally satisfied with our purchase of the Garmin Nuvi 350 from Amazon.com. We simply set our destination, place it on our dashboard, and listen to the clear voice-guided instructions. The battery life is excellent, so on a number of trips under 4 hours, we've yet to use the 12-volt power adapter.We recently purchased two more nuvi-350's as gifts for our kids. Delivery time has been less than a week using Amazon's free super-saver shipping.Thanks,Jim & Marge"
5,Don't know how I did w/out Nuvi,"This is my first GPS and I am thoroughly impressed at the capabilities of the Nuvi 350. I spent a significant amount of time researching the different tools before I settled on this one. It is extremely easy to use and has an amazing database of map & points of interest information - more than I expected. I haven't yet taken full advantage of it's MP3, audiobooks, picture viewing capabilities, etc. as I was most interested in the GPS aspects of the product. It is very reliable. I would highly recommend it."
5,Exactly what I was looking for,I bought the nuvi 350 in early December...I registered it and looked for updated...it was already at the latest level. It came with the 2009 maps. Worked perfectly out of the box. I have used it daily since purchase and have had no problems. Very satisfied with my purchase.
5,great GPS!,"It's a great GPS.However not that smart. Such as could not pronounce the road name when it's time to make a turn.But for the price compared to other more expensive ones, maybe we cannot complain."
1,bad quality,"I have bought many electronics from amazon over the years. The first time I have to return. The 350 is light, pocket size; lcd is bright; voice is clear; text-speech is great; play mp3 and photos even though I don't expect to use them very much. Everything is great until a week later. The lcd screen went nuts. The whole screen turns into bright grey and you can't see nothing. Reset didn't help much. Once a while things will go back to normal.Very disappointed experience. I am not even sure I got a new, open box item, or refurbished unit. There is no CD not even a user guide in the box. I download the manual from their website which has much more information. The box is in a plastic bag that is not even sealed. Shipped it back today."
3,Needs work,"I bought this to take to Europe for both street navigation as well as help in walking around the cities. I also bought the travel kit/translator.In the cities, it didn't work at all. Since it is small, I was hoping to input places/hotels, etc and find them and my way back. Only worked about 20%of the time despite testimonials that it works in the valleys of NYC.Its road navigation wasn't good either. It always got us off the main highways about 15miles early and sent us thru the backwoods on unnamed roads. Very disappointing.Never got to use the translator because of the amount of scrolling it takes.Overall I am not satisfied-maybe I expect too much?"
5,Worked well from Florida to DC and back,"We went on a driving vacation to Washington, DC with the Garmin Nuvi 350 GPS. It worked really well all the way there and back. Even though it is our first GPS, the interface was pretty intuitive. I drove and my wife used it to navigate, find restaurants, hotels etc. We got used to some of its quirks: for example, ""keep left"" doesn't mean turn left, it means don't exit right. We probably would have gotten lost about 30 times without it. I happily recommend it. We're happy with our purchase."
3,Fair for a Garmin,"I've had a garmin unit on my laptop for quite a while. The laptop was great. It could find anything anywhere and really take you through some off the wall places if you wanted a direct fastest route. Be prepared to use dirt roads!Obviously a laptop in a car is a real pain even though you get a huge map. But the 360 screen is... well not as bad as you would think. But the 360 leaves much to be desired, comparitively. To be honest, I'm quite disappointed with this unit.The problem for me is, driving by a sams club, for instance, you type in sams club and... nearest one is about 150 miles away. When you know there are a few within a 50 mile radius. Same with dunkin donuts. It makes me wonder what else it's missing. The laptop finds them all. I don't know if it's that the laptop has so much more room for details or what. But the 360 is certainly no where near as accurate.Still, it will get you where you're going but don't expect to see everything you can on the way."
4,Sleek but OK,This GPS has got all the features except for the bluetooth compatability which is available in nuvi 360. I didn't think it is necessary for me so I opted for 350.Pros:1)Sleek design and lightweight2)Fits into a pocket well3)plays mp34)has picture viewer and other applications like currency converter etc5)has text-to-speechCons:1)often takes a gr8 amt of time to acquire satellite connection2)wanders off in hilly places and over-bridges3)when you are searchin for places... sometimes it takes forever to show results4)would be better if we know the turn atleast a mile before instead of 0.5 miles
4,A fun toy,"Wasn't having trouble getting lost, but this is fun to have and amazing to see it guide me, even in familiar territory. Our small town must have some outdated platting, as every direction to and from our house is on a street that has never existed. Can't really fault the Nuvi for that. Easy to enter new addresses."
3,"Nice system, but kind of slow when giving directions.","Garmin has been great so far, however, the product came with many useless software which I don't need, and it does not give directions quickly; by the time the navigator has recalculated a new route, I've passed the exit or street it was talking about. Accuracy of where my car is exactly located is also poor on this product. This is great for those people with poor sense of direction, because it gives you an idea of where you are, but would I travel to some unknown part of the US with this thing, NO."
4,"My new Boyfriend, I don't leave home without him","I love my Garmin Nuvi. I refer to it as my new boyfriend, although I have a husband of 21 years, he does not give good directions. It is easy to use for technologically challenged people like myself, easy to see and easy to hear. The setting are easy to use touch screen. The only down side I have found is the battery. I would like it to last a bit longer. I just make sure I have the car charger and the plug with me at all times. Even better reason for sucess, my boss ordered a different brand and model GPS from a different company right after I bought mine. I told him to get this one but he is the boss. Well, suddenly he found that the bid he won on the item was suddenly on back order and they were not able to tell him when it would be avaialable. He cancelled his order and placed a new order for the NUVI, just as I had recommended. I guess the boss is not ALWAYS right."
5,Everything it was suppose to be and more.,"I love the 350. Took is on a two week road trip this summer and wondered how I ever got around without one. Screen is more than big enough yet you can fit it into your shirt pocket. It remains in my car all the time. Invaluable when suddenly you want to find somewhere like the nearest drug store or even more valuable a gas station. Have recommended to several people who have bought it and are equally pleased. It isn't perfect and it would be nice if the maps could be updated via computer rather than buying a CD every year. Remember this thing begins to go out of date the day you buy it, particularly in areas where there is a lot of construction and road work going on."
5,men don't have to ask for directions,"Garmin nüvi 350 3.5-Inch Portable GPS NavigatorJust great, easy to use right out of the box. Took my first 360 mile trip and a route I knew well, Gracie (I named my gps) took me a little different route and it saved me time. Took me right to a Cracker Barrel resturant that would have been hard to find on my own. Gave me the names of the rivers & streams I crossed, very easy to follow the route. When giving me voice directions I did not have to look at it in busy traffic. I made the best choice possible, you can to. Best price was thru Amazon and I am a shopper..Don"
4,Garmin Nuvi 350 is very good,"For the most part this device is very good. It definitely will get you from point A to point B. I used it around town to see how it worked before I took it ""on the road."" I disagreed with the way it took me a few times, but it did get me there. For areas where you do not know the area or how to go, it is great. I recently used it for a trip to New York and New Jersey and it worked great - even in the canyons of NYC. I plan on using it for many upcoming road trips. I still find it useful to look at a map before I go to make sure I have a feel for how I am going, but it is not necessary. I definitely recommend this item."
5,A few minor quirks with an amazing product,"The Nuvi 350 is amazing in what it can do. It is quite user friendly just using the startup menu but some items require more detail as contained in the user manual. This manual has to be downloaded to a computer to be accessed and at better than 70 pages, is expensive to print. Considering the price of the unit, a printed manual should be supplied.The unit calls for some odd turns to be taken when driving on a major straight road and in some cases, the turn called for doesn't exist. e.g. route 41 in Sarasota, Fl. It's only as good as the software supplied which is apparently not as thoroughly or frequently updated as it might be. For instance, new roads existing for a yer not shown and inaccurate restaurant info showing long defunct places."
4,Great time and gas saving but more update needs,"The device has my satisfaction with its 80% accuracy of the acquisition. It is employed to lead out of the maze. There are times that it made the ways to obsolete or non-existence places, but like every thing in life, there is always room for improvement.For that: (1) detour from the route only works when it is on the route, not before, so user has to be actually on the non-desired route before it can guide to the alternatives, (2) non-existence places need to be updated, (3)the GPS car holder is too stiff, hard to pull the device out without breaking the adhesive that hold the holder to the dash board, (4) the car charger cable when charging the device makes it very fragile to break, here the device is supposed to be used daily so more stable and robustness should be factored in the design.Other than these, it is good to let the 350 be a guidance with human sense."
4,Never lost again,I had a Garmin GPS before this one. I love them both. Very user friendly and a great deal for the cost. The oly reason I ranked it a 4 stars is because I wish it were a wider screen.
4,garmin nuvi 350 gps`,"Just trust this little product and you'll never need a map again. This little guy even found us a wonderful restaurant, the beach, the local hardware store and even our daughter's home."
2,not very good a map,The map is not very new I think. It made several mistakes since I used it for one month.
2,Not ready for easy riding,"This was advertised as offering text to speech. I have yet to determine how to get it to name street names. Mybe there is a way, but I was unable to get help from Garvin on their website and no contact information was available.This is not a user friendly device."
3,could be better,"The garmin helps if you already sort of know an area or if you're not in a hurry. It tries to take you down very small road shortcuts that ending taking a LOT longer than if you were able to program in that you want the freeways. If you're looking for a particular place, like a gas station, it's useful, because it will find all of the nearest and you can quickly get to what you need. The most annoying thing is that you can't choose a path and if it doesn't want you to take a freeway, which you know is the fastest route, you have to ignore it and then it keeps trying to make you do u-turns to go back."
1,Garman 350 with speech,"My wife had a TomTom without speech so I tryed the Garmin with speech. I found the Garmin very unsatisfactory.We tested the two GPS's side by side in the same car. In town,around buildings or with an overcast sky the G had difficulty in finding a satellite but the T had no problems.We did several tests driving with both units in the same car. The T would drive us past an estblished street leading directly to our home and take us nearly a mile out of the way. On the other hand the G never failed to give us the correct turns.I returned the G bought a TomTom 130S with speech for about $10 more. I have been very satified with by new TomTom 130S."
3,Slow Loading Time and Absurd direction from time to time,"I had high expectation from this product but it is not really meeting my expectation. The loading time from start-up is very slow and it takes a long time for the GPS to acquire signal. Sometimes, it'll be 10 minutes for it to get signal where I will be driving aimlessly on the freeway.The direction it gives is laughable sometimes. from my house to a local drugstore Garmin will direct me to go on the freeway while it is perfectly accessible to get there locally.I suggest you spend a little more money to get a better Garmin. Garmin still has its perks with its great text-to-speech functions and etc."
4,"I'm sure that there are better, but this one is great!","Very easy to start up, right out of the box. It froze-up the first time I used it. I reset the unit and have not had any problems again. I'm discovering many uses for it. I strongly recommend this unit to anyone who leaves the house to go anywhere new."
3,"Good, but could be better","This Garmin is a handy device, but it does have some shortcomings, for me. When I used this in Santa Fe, I did not always have an exact destination address to enter. This Garmin would have been a more helpful tool if I could enter crossroads or other close landmarks instead. This model also lacks general POI (Points of Interest) in additions to gas stations and restaurants."
5,Best new Toy!,"I bought my Garmin Nuvi 350 after seeing my friend's. It is portable, convenient, easy to use. I got it mainly cuz of my 50 mile commute and in case of traffic tie-ups, its easy to get off any exit and the GPS 'calculates' new directions from there. I've gotten much more use out of it, then I had anticipated. I use it hiking, biking and lending to teenage daughter for longer trips. I also plan on loading pictures to show to relatives on my next trip instead of having to take umpteen zillin hardcopies. Works straight from the box and set-ups are all intuitive (although you can look at manual on-line). Easy to mount on windshield and I love the portability."
3,Good device.,"Can miss the turn because [1] there is a delay in updating current position and [2] it is a little late in sending instructions, so you may not have enough time to change line.The proposed route can be bad due to lack of road condition considered, e.g., going through mountains can be very slow.Over all, it is a very helpful device, but you can not fully rely on it. For examples, I would stay on major road rather than taking advantures during my travel; Don't assume there is always a gas station following the GPS; A hard copy of map is still of necessary for travel."
4,Excellent Nav. unit,"i bought the C330 a couple of years ago, and this is a great improvement. the map is much easier to read, it takes up less space and now you can play mp3's and audiobooks. Another cool feature is the abilitu to change the ""car"" to a truck, motorcycle or even a spaceship.ive tried the other brands and this one is the easiest to use.anyone wanna buy a C330?"
2,Garmin 350,This unit continues to direct me through subdivisions and off the freeways to back roads and through small towns. It even tried to send me through a cul-de-sac and down a one way street the wrong way. Map updates do not resolve the problems.
4,Work Great,"I purchased the 350-GPS about 2 years ago, based on good customer reviews, and reasonable price. A unit runs great.Thang D"
5,Exactly what seller reported,"Owner posted description that was honest. Battery won't hold charge, but the GPS works perfectly on car charger that he provided. Received product in two days nicely wrapped. Unit in great condition, works perfectly. The maps were all updated. Can't beat this for an investment under $20"
5,Garmin Nuvi 350 Pocket GPS,This GPS is great to have for your directions. Would not be without it. Very happy with this product. Good to have when you are not familiar with the area. The sound is great. Also will help to find restaurants and other points of interest.
4,One complaint,"From an operational standpoint, this unit is top notch. It works beautifully, and the features are amazing. The ONLY complaint I have is the faint line of shadows on the right side of the screen. It's particularly noticeable when viewing a white background. I ordered a replacement unit, but it had the same problem. I finally decided that I could live with it, since the unit works so perfectly otherwise. Garmin should address this issue however."
2,Great Product...but costs $70 each year to update,The garmin is great. But I wish I had known that is costs $70 a year to update your maps. The updates are essential as construction is constantly changing the face of our roads. My garmin has already lead me to several wrong locations this year (I bought it in Oct. 2007).The cost of updates is vital information to the consumer and Garmin is deceitful for not letting the consumer know that ahead of time.
1,Nuvi 350 Garmin poor support,Garmin has very poor customer service and support. bought NUVI350 in 2007. Used on several trips. Each time I tried to get service I got a run around from Garmin. Screen has now failed. Garmin wants 175.00 for flat repair service. Can purchase a new one for less. Time to try Tom Tom. Reviews show customers are much more satisfied with their customer support.
4,compact and easy to use,"I've had the Garmin now for almost 2 months. It's small enough to fit in my pocket or purse, yet big enough for viewing. I velcroed it to my steering column, so I can remove it and have it right by my speedometer for a quick view, if necessary, without blocking it. Speaks the street names and shows better routes to drive if need to change. Recalculates quickly. The only drawback is that it may take a while for it to acquire a satellite signal when initially turned on...as much as a few minutes a couple of times. That's a bit frustrating when you need to get going. Otherwise, it was a great buy for the price."
4,Great but...,"I agree with all the wonderful pluses that are mentioned but there are two negatives that you need to know about.#1. The suction cup is not reliable. Even after making sure that it's been mounted firmly, it still FALLS OFF sometimes. I'm lucky that the GPS screen didn't break both times it fell off the windshield.#2. You have to be out in the open when you turn the device on for it to acquire the sat signal. If you turn it on inside your garage or in a parking structure, it won't acquire the signal - you'll have to reboot it on the road or wait forever before it finally picks up a signal.For the money, though, it still is a great value and I would buy it again."
5,Garmin Nuvi 350 Pocket Vehicle GPS Navigator,"I purchased this GPS unit in March 2007 and so far everything is working great. It was extremely easy to setup. I had it running and ready to use in about 20 minutes. It is very accurate. Without using the car charger, a single charge can last more than 6 hours as advertised. The only thing that would make it better is a larger screen."
4,Garmin Nuvi 260,"Just a typical female who wanted some saftey and security to travel from Calif. to Utah. Since it's certainly easy to get lost this was a good choice. The nav. device started up quickly and I did'nt have to have a degree in high tech. to get it going,a real added plus! It was quick and effortless to set up. The only real problem with it-and I did conciter this a real problem-was that if you did'nt take the route it wanted you to,it would reroute you back to were it felt you should be. Even if the route it wanted was 60 miles out of the way! I did like the fact that if you missed an exit it would give you the next-but again in a ""round about way"" that cost alot of time,gas and some frustration. Bouncing you all over the side roads rather than puting you on the nearest freeway entrance. The maps need to be ""updated Badly"". So if you decide to take a small diverstion (after you get there)turn it off. Then re-enter the address you want-it will be easier on you and the car,hahaha."
4,Good - not perfect,I works as advertised. It knows the street names and the gal doesn't get mad when I don't follow her instructions precisely. My only disappointment is that you are limited to one waypoint. My previous i-Way allowed any number of waypoints which was very desirable for my meals-on-wheels deliveries. Finds itself quickly.
2,Don't Buy,"Don't buy. I would have returned this Garmin nüvi 350 if I bought it from Costco where returns are easy. For about the same price, check out the Magellan Maestro series. I bought this from Amazon because of the 4.5 stars from over 2,000 reviews.Pros:- SmallCons:- Text-to-Speech is lousy.- Occasionally (usually just before destination arrival), the device stops ""directing"".- Routes are not optimal.- MP3 works but why would you want to listen to music through this speaker?I have owned this for over a month now and have done weekly web updates so I should have the latest software. Again, don't buy."
2,A Good Sales Pitch but Unacceptable,The hardware doesn't work properly and I got stuck with an outdated version of the software. When recently using the unit on a trip the machine could not correctly pronounce some street names.The installed software was so outdated it took me to places that were no longer in existence. It's very apparent that Garmin is just going for the bucks and an unfortunate customer like myself will be forced to pay out the nose for an upgraded version of data that should have come with the unit.Be careful. In hopes to get the latest GPS software I waited many months before buying the unit but was still taken by Garmin. In addition to these disappointments described Garmin doesn't even provide a manual.
5,Garmin Nuvi 350,"So far I have been very pleased with this item Amazon did not stir me wrong on this! I was able read many reviews and that helped my buying decision.I received this in a very timely manner, sooner than I expected. It came with everything as stated. This product is very friendly user and the manual was easy to download.thanks again Amazon!!"
