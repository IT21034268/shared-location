5,perfect for any time period,"I was forced to read this book in one of my litature classes my sophomore year in college. I thought it looked horrible and sounded worse. I was so wrong. It is simply wonderful. I got completely lost in the story and the lives of all the characters. Now, almost four years later, I still find myself randomly thinking about the story and the people. It is one of the few stories that is timeless. It is unususal for me to like this kinds of book. I noramlly like adventures in far off, fantastic places. This book is not that. It is a good mistery, but more than anything, it is just a perfect example of story telling. Every word and detail is perfet for the overall effect. This is a must for ANY book lover's collection."
4,You'll shred your chemise in a fit of suspense,"This is positively the most overwrought book I have read since ""No Adam in Eden"" by Grace Metalious. I have read some of the author's short stories in the past, but this novel blew me away, with it's bodice-bursting tale of ludicrous passions and dark deeds on the windswept Cornish coast. This book has a great deal of suspense, but if you want to laugh at the heroine's weaknesses, you'll also find plenty of mean-spirited comedy. She crumbles again and again before the hired help, terrified of what they think of her underwear and hiding behind doors when they approach. Bette Davis's character in 'Dead Ringer' never had it so bad, and she deserved it, since she was a murderess. My only complaint is I wanted a more fantastic comeuppance for Mrs. Danvers after being so memorably rotten. What a great gift from Ms. DuMaurier. Read it and your friends will get sick of hearing about it."
5,classic,"classic story of a young girl marrying a mysterious man she barely knows. Complete with eerie characters and a lavish setting, this book left you asking question after question. Unfortunately, it dropped off with an open ending."
4,The classical novel of romantic suspense,"This suspenseful novel is, by a long shot, Daphne DuMaurier's most popular. The realistic character development, the complex relationships and the thickening plot makes it an enjoyable novel. As the book goes on, the reader's curiosity for this mystifying character, Rebecca, grows. However, the reader is lead in the wrong direction at first and thus is very surprised at the shocking news that is discovered. As the book draws to an end you become anxious for the main character. Sympathy is given to Mrs. De Winter and then thrilling information is revealed as all the puzzle pieces fit together. This novel is surely an incredible experience; I encourage all to read it (if you can stand your heart beating and fast paces)"
2,Rebecca,"This item was listed as a hardcover book but it was actually a paperback version that had a hard cover put on it. When I order a book that is listed as a hardcover, I expect it to be a full-size hardcover copy."
4,Rebecca,"While beautiful, the descriptions are sometimes over the top. I would imagine something one way after reading a bit, then the author would say something that shattered my mental image for absolutely no necessary reason other than being hopelessly verbose. Perhaps this is my own problem, but with so many descriptions I would have to try to figure out what the particular setting was, now.Beyond that, if you are willing to skim and dig for the important points, a rather haunting book at times."
3,A Thriller,The beginning of the book I found quite boring. But then it became very interesting and thrilling. If you like detective stories it is a good book for you. I would read it again. Someone who does not like waiting should perhaps read something else.
3,"I've read better, but I've also read much worse.","To me, this book contained too much detail. There were so many things that Daphine DuMaurier overly described. I bet you that I could cut 1/3 of the book and it would still have the same affect toward the readers, maybe even more. At first, the book was very boring and I had to force myself to read it. I finally reached the climax and that's where it got to be interesting. Too bad there were only 7 chapters left ;). For people who would like to learn how to write descriptive anything, this is the perfect book for you. Even though I am a bit skeptical on why everyone else seems to like it so much, I am glad that I have read it."
1,Quality of the book is junk!,"I have not read the book yet, but I am very disappointed in the quality of the book, it's junk; I bought the hard back to add to my library. The print is tiny and goes from the top of the page, I mean the leading edge of the top of the page. Several of the pages are skewed and print is blurry. Do not buy this edition of this book."
1,Disappointed in the Quality,"I wouldn't have even given this product a star...I am mainly writing as to the Quality of it. I was terribly DISAPPOINTED. They said the product was a hardbound book...it was - but with inferior cardboard and the front pages were stuck to the cover, didn't even represent a book of ANY masterpiece. I paid over $11 for this and I had purchased another to my mind (Masterpiece - The Count of Monte Cristo) and the book was wonderfully bound, uneven pages, quiet like an old book, amazing, for $7.95. I love this story (Rebecca) but who ever made this product should not show it again. Amazon if your reading, DO NOT get product from this vendor again!"
4,Fascinating,I found the book fascinating. I very liked it to read because it isn't difficult to understand. The story is thrilling and interesting because nobody except Mrs and Mr de Winter knew that Maxim had killed Rebecca. The murder was well organised. I really liked the dog Jasper because he always did exactly what he wanted to do. But I hated Favell.
3,Interesting,"All in all I liked reading Rebecca. It was interesting, but not always. There were also boring passages. But I liked reading it because it's a thrilling story. Sometimes I had little problems with the different persons in the book, so I didn't really always know who was who. Otherwise I didn't find it very different to understand."
2,Not my kind of thing,"The story is not bad and some scenes are exciting but after all the settings seemed too strange and the story too constructed for me. Also the characters are a little wierd, for example Ms Daver's only function is to walk through the castle and to be mysterious. It's just not the kind of books I like reading."
2,"A really good book, that is, for the last 100 pages.","This book is very dry, and dull until you reach chapter 22, then it gets more intersting. But unless you want to read that much, I don't recamand this book."
2,Boring: Too much detail,"An incredibly thin story. The author spends most of the pages descibing things as perfectly as she can which, as you should expect, is very tiresome to read."
1,This book was extremely BORING!!!,"I'm sorry, but I hadn't even read the first 50 pages yet, and I was bored stiff reading this book. People told me that it doesn't get better until towards the end, but who wants to wait until then to get to the good part. In my opinion, a good book should get you interested right away, if not then, then at least SOMETIME in the first chapter."
1,Not great,"Even as a high school English teacher, this book was a little too wordy, and the climax wasn't really that great. If I were to rewrite this book, I would take out a word or two a sentence to shorten the book and Miss DuMaurier could have used some more events rather than just the second Mrs. DeWinter comparing herself to Rebecca, Maxim's first wife. The Ben character was underused, and Mrs. Danvers could have been more sinister. That is why I gave this book 1 Star."
1,How Boring!,This is the worst book I have ever read! Pages and pages of detail with no real story. I would never inflict this book on anyone.
1,Don't read unless you have to.,"I found this book very long, drawn out and boring. It was far from realistic, and I found the characters flat and lifeless. The story was unbelievable and it's hard to stay interested - I wish I DIDN'T have to read this for school!"
1,Couldn't finish it,"I tried on two seperate occasions to read this book. The first time, six months ago, I didn't finished the first 100 pages. The second time, I got up to page 134 and quit. This book couldn't hold my interest for very long. There is too much detail written and not enough plot. I would not recommed this book to anyone. It is in my bag of books to take the used book store for trade."
1,Boring beginning,"I started this book and read about 10 pages. The whole time, the author was going off about the different kinds of plants which grew in this garden, and I didn't even know who the narrator was, and where the garden was. It was so boring and confusing that I did not read on. It probably gets much better, but I was not inspired to read more that I did."
4,oddly poetic slant to it . .,"the book tends to drag on at parts, and in other parts it'll rush . . like music, but unevenly . . the description in it is lush, but sometimes grows old. i don't see how it makes a great suspense novel, since it doesn't make one sit on the edge of their seat, biting their nails, dying to know what's going on, but it does make one hell of a romanticist book. has a lot to do with the heroine's emotion and philosophy. this book lets you dig deep into her psyche."
4,"Romantic, spooky, suspense...This book has it all!","If you like this book, try reading Stephen King's Bag of Bones. He refers to this story often and it's a really great read!"
5,great gothic,"Rebecca is surely the the quintessential Gothic suspense. DuMaurier controls and modulates the atmosphere in scene after scene with wonderful descriptive passages. The characters are simply drawn, but stay true to the tragic story. Suspense and foreboding build steadily, even though the plot holds no surprises for the modern reader.I am never interested in romance novels, gothic suspense, or mysteries. Nevertheless, I found Rebecca to be a completely satisfying read.While reading the novel, I felt like I was watching an extended directors' cut of the best Hitchcock movie ever. So I was not surprised to find that he brought Rebecca to the screen and that it was his breakthrough film. He obviously learned a great deal from DuMaurier."
2,Interesting story with a boring ending,"The story of Rebecca is interesting and different from usual ones. The novel shows the problems of the main actor, Mrs de Winter, very graphic. But for me there's not enough tension. One of the reasons for the missing tension is that you don't wonder why something happens because either you know why or you don't notice that something strange is going to happen.After about three quarters of the book, the reader knows what exactly happened with Rebecca, but the book doesn't end at this place, it still goes on. That makes the end rather boring in spite of the unclear ending."
5,"Love, love, love this book!","There is a reason it's called a classic. It is one of the best written books in history, in my option, and it really resonated with me, long after I finished it. My mom suggested it, and usually I don't care for her fare, but I am so glad I read it. I won't go into any detail because I'd hate to spoil it for anyone, but let's just say, it's a winner. Also, I loved the movie--Rebecca."
5,simply the best,"If you have never read Du Maurier's classic, you must. This book is one of my all time favorite novels and has everything a good novel should have...suspense, mystery, romance and the most colorful characters you will ever find. The first time I read the book, I couldn't put it down. And the second time, the same thing happened...even when I knew the ending!! I can certainly understand why this book propelled Du Maurier to author stardom. It should be on everyone's bucket list of books."
5,Rebecca,"GREAT - Watched it several times, It's a Classic! Can't say much more about it...except they should make more moveis like it,"
5,haunting,"I loved the story Rebecca because it sets a mood (uneasyness), and sets different scenes which are described in detail. I could almost draw the house and its many rooms. The story shows a lifestyle that has gone and will never return. The themes are trust, communication and evil."
3,Rebecca,"This book is in a class by itself. A classic romantic suspense??...possibly I guess.I found myself not becoming fully interested until about Chapter 16. From there out, the book relived a vivid nightmare for some characters. Surpise after surpise, which kept my attention."
3,"It's Not ""In The Bag""","Nat Adderley has some terrific albums in the OJC series, but unfortunately ""In The Bag"" is not one of them. The playing on this date is phenomenal, as Nat, brother ""Cannonball"" and Sam Jones join New Orleans greats including Ellis Marsalis (that's right Wynton and Branford's pops) for a big easy jam session. The only problem is the sound quality is rather poor, with the horns too bright and the drums too brittle. If only they would have cut this date in New Jersey (with Rudy Van Gelder as engineer) instead of New Orleans, it might have been a true classic. It's a real shame to see so many of the OJC CDs going out-of-print, but I guess in cases like this it's understandable."
3,A genius like Miller deserves a better book,"Mr. Style managed to get a lot of really great interviews here but seems to have had trouble focussing on Roger Miller. Style strays from the topic talking about everything from Bobby Bare's Shel Silverstein record to the feud between Waylon Jennings and Tompall Glaser, while only getting very short interviews with people like Willie Nelson and Merle Haggard who knew him so well. And where is George Jones?.I love Roger Miller and enjoyed hearing all of these stories, and I do appreciate the work that went into it. This book is for the hardcore Roger Miller fan only. Re-editied it could be very good.Finally, I'd like to know how you can criticize the sad state of contemporary country music and then have a foreward by a hack like Toby Keith?"
5,Awesome read,"Great book! Not a lot written on Roger Miller anywhere. This really sheds light on the way he was on and off stage. It is a series of interviews with people who knew him well. If you're even a little bit interested in Roger, this will make you obsessed."
1,Ain't Got No Cigarettes,"This book wass a total waste of mytime. Mr. Style does a good writingjob but the weakness is in the subject.Maple Syruple? My Uncle Used ToLove Me, But She Died? Singinginto a parking meter? What isfunny about that?Most of the contributors to thebook admit to being high with him.Maybe if one is on the samesubstances he was on his childishramblings and antics would seemlike "" genius level wit and humor.""A few of his ""serious"" songs areon the plane of a journeymanNashville songwriter. But theyare certainly not equal to thethe well crafted works of thepremier songwriters. I cite manyof Willie Nelson's compositions,Virgil Stewart's ""Just Out Of Reach,""Bob Ferguson's ""The Carroll CountyAccident,"" Cindy Walker's ""ThankYou For Calling"" and the list goeson and on.There is no place in my libraryfor this book."
5,A Classic,"I listened to these songs as a kid and was so happy to finally find this album! Even though they are old, kids everywhere will love at least a few of them. Sneaky Snake is a fave..."
2,The kids said it was bad and I had to agree!,Love country music but this is a type all it's own. Tom T Hall is great but this is not his best work and maybe his worst.
5,Wonderful for children,"Great singing/storytelling through catchy songs. Last night, I heard my husband singing, ""How do you talk to a little baby goat, you can't say hello like a man.""My 5 YO son's song is ""Sneaky Snake"". He thinks of himself as clever and sneaky(in a good-hearted, funny way). He wants me to play it over and over."
5,Wonderful CD my 4 year old and I love it!!!!,"My grandparents bought this for me during the 70's. It brings back great childhood memories. I used to listen to this over and over and look at the pictures that came with the record. I bought this on CD several years just because I loved it so much. I have played this for my son before but he was not very interested when he was younger but now he is 4 and wants to hear the songs over and over. He is trying to learn the words and really enjoys the music. this is a great album for kids and good for adults too!! before he would listen to this he wanted to hear Alan Jackson's ""little bitty"" non stop. I like that we can now listen to this and he likes several of the songs instead of just listening to the same song over and over again AGHHH."
5,A MUST Read,This book changed my whole perspective of the holocaust. It takes you through the boys experience step by step as if you are experiencing it with him. Very moving and powerful. A MUST Read.
2,maybe it will work on your kid... but it didn't work on mine,"We've tried everything to get our 6 month old to sleep through the night without us. During the early months we we found ""the happiest baby on the block"" and it worked wonders for us. So we thought this would do the same. We'll it's been a month of using the tactics in this book and we are still NOT GETTING ANY SLEEP. Our child can cry for 4 hours straight like it's nothing. The ONLY reason I gave this 2 stars was because it recommended putting a few pacifiers in the crib for the baby and that has worked a bit (we use 20 and there are still times she can't find one). Maybe this book will work for someone who's child wasn't colic or doesn't have reflux or separation issues. But if I could get my money back... I would."
4,Very Helpful for night time sleep,My husband and I wish we would have known about this book 6 months ago; I wouldn't have been so sleep deprived. This book is a must read for parents with sleep issues. I purchased this book specifically looking for nap time sleep solutions. They have some great ideas just didn't work for my baby. I have a not so good napper and an excellent night sleeper. Guess that's the luck of the draw.
1,Terrible- Utilizes the Cry it out method,"I did not read anything about this video before I bought it. I just purchased it out of desperation for sleep and wish I had researched it more. If you don't mind allowing your baby to cry it out, then you will like this video. However, know that while this method may work, think about what you will be teaching your child: that they cannot trust you, that sleep is a scary state to enter into. Do your research before attempting a method such as this. Look at alternatives. Read about attachment parenting and its views on cry it out methods, they make some good points. Follow your heart, if the idea of cry it out is heart wrenching, don't do it."
5,Amazing results in 3 days!,I would highly recommend this Dvd to any parent who is having trouble with sleep day and/or night. Our 5month old was impossible to put to sleep during the day without feeding to sleep or often when that failed we would have to rock her to sleep in her buggy. Also at night she was waking 2 to 6 times. In just 3 days she is now sleeping through the night and self settling to sleep during the day in less than 10minutes! I still can't quite believe it has worked so well. Baby Jade also seems happier and more relaxed when she is awake. Thankyou so much!!!!!
5,A gem of British Missional Scholarship,"I loved this book. And I am genuinely thankful to Stuart for doing it. It is scholarly in the classically British way--understated, gentle, articulate, and thoroughly devasating to views that have held that Christendom was the acme of a so-called Christian civilization. If you are trying to get to grips with what the church must be and become. This is a must read."
2,A Frustratingly Unreliable Book,"This book has many fascinating things in it: direct quotations from conversations with Mussolini's aides; statements about him from world figures (including a compliment from Gandhi); and information about his deeply personal feelings regarding certain matters. Unfortunately, there are no citations (footnotes or endnotes) to back any of these up. In other words, the reader has no way to judge the reliability of what Hoyt is saying.I know that publishers of books for popular consumption tend to dislike footnotes. However, Hoyt paints Mussolini in a better light than most other biographers or historians, and many of his conclusions are controversial. The absence of citations makes me doubt Hoyt; perhaps if he had included them, I would take some of his statements more seriously.However, if you simply want to know the undisputed facts such as when and how he took power, this book will do nicely."
5,Good Read,Communication is so important in every situation. This book will provide the reader with some great tips on reading other people!
4,Best of its kind,"A wonderful little book for knowing more about yourself and identifying how we all communicate by non-verbal means. Packed with real-life examples, photos, and drawings to illustrate the points made; this little gem is a great resource for understanding an important topic."
2,Silly book,"Written for 12 year olds, this book has very little content and lots of fluff. The chapters go like this: first you get some useful information, then you get some crazy (evo psych) reason why we developed that body language, then you get some terribly executed wisecracks.As I read, I began to seriously question the credibility of the authors."
3,"The book is informative, but fails to deliver.","The book is entertaining and informative, but very poorly written. It is not organized at all. One chapter will talk about eyes, but all the sudden it will jump back to hand gestures. They compare the same people too often(Hitler, Clinton, and Marilyn Monroe). They fail to list proper sources for their interpretations too. While they are not wrong on some of the subjects, I felt like I was reading ""natural cures they do not want to know about"".I would not be blasting it this bad, had the book cost less. There is a lot better books out there on this subject, some of which are free."
3,Fun to read,"The book is fun to read and has an extensive bibliography. However, the lack of an index and reference citations leads me to suspect it isn't meant to be taken seriously."
2,Could have been better,"I am an avid book reader and I like books having to do with psychology, sociology and/or related topics. I thought this book would be fascinating. I do find the subject matter very interesting. However, this particular book was not very well organized and I found the information in it somewhat limited."
3,Definitive Book of Body Language,This is a quick and easy read. It opened my eyes to body language. I believe most of us are not aware of our postures and therefore if you can read body language you are ahead of the game.
1,Too basic,"Did not present new or defining revelations on the subject matter that one could pick up on their own life journey, for my tastes any way."
3,Body Language,"The definite book of body language by Alan and Barbara pease, was first recommended to me by my school. I was taking a course in private investigations. The book is very well written and is written in such a way that the average person can easily follow what is being talked about. I like the idea the authors use present-day celebrities, also photographs and/or illustrations so that the reader can see by example. I also like the fact that the authors use humor to explain certain situations. In today's world where people are not going to be always honest about their true feelings this is a good book to have and to read. I give this book 5 stars. Candy"
2,long and boring,"it had a lot of details but the book was just so long that i didn't understand it. it made reading boring, it drags -what you're trying to learn and what they're trying to teach- out instead of cutting it to the chase and making it more understandable.in the end you're just so bored with it.. that you skim through it and not learn a thing. well maybe a thing or two but much less than what you expected or should gain from reading this."
1,Too political and too much Hitler,"There are too many photos of Hitler in this book. Do you really want to improve your body language by studying Hitler?Also, the authors rudely compared a photo of George W. Bush to a photo of a chimp, and they complain about Bill Clinton too much.Too political and too much Hitler.One star."
4,The Definitive Book of Body Language,"The book showed up a few days after I ordered it, in excellent condition. Looks brand new.Thus far, the book itself is OK. I would not recommend it, nor would I not not recommend it, to anyone."
3,Body Language,"First, you sent me the wrong book. I ordered Body Language 101.However, Body Language was an easy read."
4,Very interesting book,"I found this book to be very useful and informative. It brings up interesting points and as you are reading it you will say ""wow I do that or I remember someone doing that"". Very inteesting. However, the authors grasping at evolutionary straws got very old, very quickly. That is the only downside to this book and the fact that it touches so briefly on a few topics and keeps refering to one of their previous books that you need to read both to really understand body language. Good book though."
5,Really useful info,"It's amazing how much you can tell about somebody from their hand shake or smile. (Chapters one and two). You really will want to start examining people to see if you can tell who is lying or what they really mean. Also, if you're a guy and you really want to fool your girlfriend or wife, you are gonna really have to try hard. It seems that women have a real edge on reading body language."
4,interesting read,"I was hoping for a bit more, but still the book delivers on it's premise of helping someone determine the meaning of body language."
4,Good Overall Work of Knowledge,"As opposed to the money I spent on the Micro Expression books, this book is a world of knowledge that you can actually use when you get through reading. Much of the material is stuff that you have known or known about. This book puts the ""general knowledge"" stuff into a useable form. It also debunks some old myths.I do recommend this book as it will provide the reader with something that can be used after reading the information. It is also written at a level that most anyone can understand. Don't let it's simplicity lead you to believe the information is not true - I use the information from this book to help evaluate possible security threats and in interviewing suspects."
5,An entertaining introduction,"A real fun introduction to the field of body language. This book will teach you minute body gestures that reveal certain emotions and that you are most likely to be unaware of. Full of illustrations and depictions that make the presentation all the more entertaining and retain-able. As you proceed through this book, you will have real fun putting this knowledge to the test on people you know as well as people you don't know and you will be amazed at how oblivious people are to their own bodies and how they reveal explicitly their thoughts and intentions, which is good news because you will also learn to control your own body language and make sure you convey the right messages. The book also gives valuable advice to salespeople on how they should watch and evaluate the body language of their prospective customers and act accordingly. This is a real fun book and is definitely worth your time and money"
2,Body Language Experts need a Writing Expert,"This book is full of information, but it is poorly presented. The authors may know what they are talking about, but it's hard to tell. It's like that poorly written term paper your friend asked you to proofrean and you had to completely rewrite. I learned more from the Introduction of ""The Complete Idiot's Guide to Body Language.""My main beef with this book is that after reading it, I know a lot about the ""basics"" of body language, but not really how to read it. They take a lot of time to point out that you have to look at ""clusters"" instead of any one signal, and then spend the rest of the book interpreting individual symbols! They also tend to present most of the gestures as ""absolutes"" or definite, while every other book warns you that all gestures can have multiple interpretations and you must be careful.Honestly, not a bad reference, but hardly ""Definitive."" don't make it the only book you read!"
3,Full of unsubstantiated statements,"This book is full of generalizations and unsubstantiated statements. Even looking at the back cover you can tell it did not get much backing from serious people (the praise comes from other authors of similar books, not from researchers or universities, and the authors are not antropologists or sociologists, just regular people). You will find many statements like ""90% of all people use a palms up handshake"" without any studies or anything else to back that up. In general, it's like reading USA Today, no more, no less."
5,Proven Techniques,"I truly enjoyed this book. I have been using these techniques for years without realizing it. One point that stood out was when we say we're good at reading people, we are actually reading a person's body language and noticing there is no congruency between their words and actions. Again, this is a great reference book."
4,book well done,while reading this book i just enjoy to learn new things that all the time were in front of my eyes!
3,Its a good book,"It's a good book. However, it provides too many examples of ""definite"" situations. I dont think EVERY sign can be interpreted as one conclusion."
2,The Definitive Book of Body language,"Probably if you never heard of Body Language and cultural differences this book may be considered interesting to you.Dont be fooled by the many other offerings by the Authors they may be prolific but terrific:Teriffic Origin: 1667, ""frightening,"" from L. terrificus ""causing terror or fear,"" from terrere ""fill with fear"" (see terrible) + root of facere ""to make"" (see factitious)."
2,"no footnotes, mostly urban legend","These two folks make an enormous amount of unattributed statements. If authors do that, one would hope that they would reference a specific assertion to an actual source. No such luck in this book. In the first chapter they state that recent mri scans show women have more areas of communication in their brains then do men. This may or not be true, they cite no source for this statement so the non-comatose reader can check out the validity of their statement.Neither of them, from what I can deduce, are doctors. This entire book is 'science or studies show....'. How can one write a non-fiction book and not backup at least some of their statements. If you like pop psychology this book might be useful for light reading. The lack of footnotes or specific attributions kills this book for me."
4,Good beginner book,Great beginner book with a wealth of information that should be well known to some already and to some not. body language for dummies is almost the same book so dont buy both if you are going to dive farther into this field!
4,Very insightful!,"This book is very insightful and exciting. I'm not all the way through it yet but have absorbed so much already and find myself analyzing people based on what the book has taught me all through out the day. The only part I didn't really care for was the parts about body language in other countries, I understand why they get into it but it kind of droned on for me. However, its still a great read. I totally recommed this is you're wanting to figure out peoples true intentions or thoughts."
5,Great Book,It has diagrams and pictures that show what each body gesture looks like and what they mean. Very informative and a great tool to learn about reading body language.
5,Best book I have found on this subject,"This book is very comprehensive on reading body language, including facial expressions. His experience using the techniques is extensive and has given him reliable results, using these techniques for any social interaction, whether it is for crime fighting, business transactions, or just interacting with friends. I read 3 books on this subject and found this one to be the most informative, and his humor keeps you laughing throughout the book. If you are interested in reading people well, this is the book to get."
4,Very interesting book,"Although some things seem a little far-fetched, I really enjoyed this book. My gut tells me that the authors may take a few liberties in their interpretations of studies, but I am really not sure.On a very positive note - everyday of reading it, I would learn something new and interesting. Overall, worth the time and money. I suggest you buy the book."
3,A good intro for those interested.,"This book serves as a good introduction to the subject of body language. While not a definitive guide I have several books on the subject and none of them, consisting of no more than 200 pages, are complete. Body language is a study that requires alot of personal experience and experimentation. If you are truly interested in th subject then you probably will end up like me with several books that you can continually reference. I don't know if there is ONE book out there that can provide all of the info a person would need to master the subject. that being said who cares, this one is good enough to add to your library."
2,Detecting lying is clearly lying,"It might just because I have read some serious books on lie detection, but after reading those this books sort of looses credibility. I read a (quite expensive, mind you) book from the Library calledDetecting Lies and Deceit: The Psychology of Lying and the Implications for Professional Practice (Wiley Series in Psychology of Crime, Policing and Law). This is written like a peer reviewed journal by a expert at lie detection, he essentially tells you the 'fool proof' ways of detecting lies in this book are bunk. This section being so inaccurate makes me question the accuracy of other sections."
2,Meh. There are better books out there.,"This book is definitely better than some of the body language books out there but it is certainly not the best. The biggest problem with the book in my opinion is that the author goes on and on and on. Most chapters could be summarized into a couple of pages and the writing style is very showy (""Let me tell you something most people would never dream of!...""). The illustrations are terrible and at times are confusing or ineffective as an examples of what to look for.Instead of this I would recommend ""What every body is saying"" by Joe Navarro and ex-FBI interrogator. The book unlike this one is straight to the point and has better/more information presented in a much better format. He also comments on a lot of personal experiences/observations that, while are not backed by any scientific studies, are relevant considering his line of work and are extremely insightful."
5,Shiny!,"Ah. Truly sweet. A lengthy intro from Joss about the making of the movie and the Firefly universe, followed by the screenplay (including a few deleted scenes), all interlaced with numerous gorgeous color shots. A wonderful book for anyone with interest in the movie, or the 'Verse."
4,"Good, but not great","Does a great job of giving you inside info on how Joss saw the movie, nice art, and the conmplete screenplay (with translated chinese for the phrases, and a few notes on some tiny scene cuts from the final print.)But, overall, feels much thinner then many other making of books I have purcased. Seems like a lot less information and ""making of"" stuff, since most the book is the script.So, I loved the 1st hour I spent with the book, and after that, pretty much wished there was more."
5,A Must,"This book is great for Firefly and Serenity fans, with all sorts of interesting tidbits, photos, etc. Obviously, if you're not a Firefly fan, then it's not for you."
3,Just alright,"This one was just alright. I think I have seen this one on HBO. The scenes were pretty good. Was good quailty, picture and sound. Not real sure if it was worth the money. Overall it was alright."
2,Buyer Beware...10 x 14 inches as stamped on bottom.,"Bottom of pan is stamped 10 x 14 inches.About the same size as the glass baking dish which is 9 x 12.Pan is very light...no where near the 7 pounds in the description.Definitely less than 3 pounds.Finish is the worst I have seen in stainless steel ( dries with water spots )The selling price should have been less than $29.I am a fan of Calphalon but this item looks more like counterfeit.I will keep it and use it, but would NOT recommend it or give it away as a gift. Would not buy again if this one got lost or stolen"
1,False advertizing,"I had a large metal lasagna pan that measured 3""X11""X16"". The Teflon coating was wearing off and it was beginning to rust. I was specifically looking for a large stainless steel pan similar to this. They claimed the product dimensions were 12.4 x 3.5 x 18.8 inches ; 4 pounds. When in fact it was 10 x 2.75 x 14. I was very disappointed."
2,stupid,"This show is stupid. Which is too bad, because I like all the actors in the show and the story sounded fun, but the writing just ruins it all."
3,Surprisingly,This is a decent suprisingly episode for a brand new show with non obtrusive humor that well made me have a few laughs & giggles! :-)
5,Lots and lots of FUN!!!!,"This book was a lot of fun and much like several of the others who have written reviews of Millionaire Boy:The Adventures of a Game Show Contestant, I found myself laughing outloud several times.The perfect sitting by the pool book!If you like Dave Barry, you'll appreciate the humor in this book.Anybody know if the author has written anything else?"
5,Who Wants to Laugh Out Loud?,"OK, so it was the title that got me since i was not a ""Who Wants To Be a Millionaire"" fan. My friend loaned it to me and i had HAD to check it out. Then i had to have one of my own.What a clever, funny book that was clearly written from the heart. What a fresh directive. I could almost hear the author talking to me. I could almost ""see"" the people and nearly experience what was going on, the desciptions were so clear.I think Im now a Millionaire Fan..Now i tape all the shows to find J.E.'s show and watch it. -THANKS ALOT -All i need to know now is.....what's next Millionaire Boy?"
4,Mostly what I expected,"After reading many reviews for backpacks and slings, I decided this was the best option as far as durability and functionality. I would change about 3 things however. 1) A padded handle would sure be nice for those times when I can't have it slung over my shoulder. 2) Sturdier zipper pulls. I had one pull apart in the first week and had to string some twine through the zipper to be able to pull it open/shut. It works. 3) Sure wish it had been as spacious as advertised. Sometimes I need to carry 6"" binders (+ laptop and office supplies) for work and travel. Luckily I had read the reviews and gone to the manufacturer's site and knew to expect a smaller bag.Apart from those things, however, I am very happy with this purchase. So far it does exactly what I need it to."
5,Shuckin' and Jivin',This is a great book on Black folklore and stories that we have all heard down through the years. I would recommend every African American read it if they haven't already. This is a great book!
5,On a scale of 1-10 this book is a 20!,"I collect wedding cake books,and have for 14 years. this book is a wealth of modern information and fresh ideas. I have paid alot of money for some of the books and been very disapointed. Romantic wedding cakes is a steal at any price. You will not be disapointed in this book. No line drawings here just beautiful page after page.Kerry constantly pushes the limit of what can be done with sugar, and I thank her for that. This will be my favorite wedding cake book until Kerry's next book is out! Thank You Kerry for SHARING!"
3,A little over the top,"This book tries too hard to come up with new ideas. Some of the cakes in this book have so much stuff on them that they dont even look like food. There are a few new and interesting techniques, but over all I think they are all over done."
2,disappointed,"I was really looking forward to this book, but was very disappointed. Although some of the work is outstanding, the cake colors are pretty much the same throughout the book. The flowers do not look natural and flat leaves are far from normal! With all the effort that was put into this book, I was expecting ideas that would be useful. Many of the tools that she uses are NOT widely available, therefore making it difficult to even attempt to do any of the cakes. In most parts of the country, it is very difficult to get anyone to pay what it would take to do any of these cakes. For the most part, Kerry's work is beautiful, but I would like to see less lustre dust (gold or pearl) and more natural looking flowers and greenery. ...The cakes by the other artists were for the most part, the best part of the book."
2,A waste of money!,"The reviews we read encouraged us to purchase this book. When it arrived, it turned out to be a huge disappointment. We were expecting beautiful pictures of wonderful cakes but instead we were inundated by tacky wedding cakes which are hardly ""romantic"". The two reasons why we decided to give this book a two-star rating is, firstly, that it has some how-to techniques and secondly, we did it out of pity."
1,Pretty Average,"Thid book was not what I was expecting. I was hoping for a book that showed me lots of different pictures of lovely cakes that my wedding clients could pick from. What I got was a book that shows ugly out-dated cakes that belong in some other time period that rejected them, and then to top it off - how to make these ugly cakes.Not at all what I was after and nothing like the description made it out to be."
3,Excellent means of purchasing L-arginine...,"The L-arginine in powdered form is effective, but has a very strong taste which is difficult to cover up unless mixed into a protein shake which usually isn't terribly tasty as is. Not terrible in blueberry juice, makes the taste of tea and coffee repugnant and bitter."
5,Get the Correct Edition,"The best version of this book is ISBN 1453874496 --Civil Disobedience: And Other Political Writings-- with the pen and ink bottle on the cover. Published by American Renaissance Books / CreateSpace.The reviews complaining about typos and poor layout refer to a different publisher's edition, which should be avoided."
2,Poor Quality,"I was very disappointed in the quality of the book. The typesetting is atrocious, with many misspellings. Very hard to read. Avoid this edition."
1,very sad...and disappointing,"I have longed to see the Amazon through the eyes of Christian creationists for a very long time. But this movie was a huge let down. I plan on traveling to Peru one day, but I'm not learning much that will help me from this movie. The movie commentator is overly excited about every little thing, but there is not much substance to the movie. Honestly, I felt like perhaps I should have watched something from the discovery channel and gained way more."
3,Good and enjoyable to see the talent of this duo,"Too often regulated to pop radio, Hall and Oates are music artists who can craft a tune, lyrics and create a song which many here are showcased."
4,Great Rock and Soul,"Although this album is not as strong as the early 80's work, it is a very soulful album. ""I'm in Pieces"" is a great classic soul feel; the hit ""Everything your Heart Desires"" is very typical Hall & Oates...their signature background vocals; ""Missed Opportunity"" is another fine example of their special vocal blend....no other band gets that smooth vocal blend - 80's version of Philly Soul. For people checking out Hall and Oates for the first time, I'd probably recommend their previous album, ""Big Bam Boom"". However, ""Ooh Yeah"" would be a close second or third."
4,best blue eyed soul,just have say listen to cd jon oates great singer but daryl hall is the best white soul singer ever ever ever ever ever missed oprirtny one of there best songs soul love cool song
2,Eh....,"Hall and Oates had a weird couple of years between 1984 and 1997 as far as albums go. Everything was pretty hit-or-miss. And as a staunch (to my never-ending ridicule) supporter of Hall and Oates, I have to say that OOH YEAH! hasn't held up very well. When it was released, I loved everything on here..... over the years, it's become the most dated album in the catalog. Even BIG BAM BOOM doesn't sound as dated to me as this. As usual, the best song on the album, ""I'm In Pieces,"" never got airplay. This is one of the major reasons H&O disappeared from the charts for so long... they released the wrong singles. And yes, side one was filled with the good stuff and side B was woefully lacking. And over-produced. The next time they were really back on track was 1997's MARIGOLD SKY which I highly recommend...."
4,"""Ooh Yeah!"" says it all.","Usually Daryl & John's ballads are the biggest sellers, so it's no surprise that ""Everything Your Heart Desires"" hit the Top 5 on Billboard.This album may lean on the techno-side a bit much for some people's taste but hey, you'll like it...Best tracks are ""Everything Your Heart Desires"", ""Missed Opportunity"", ""Downtown Life"", ""Talking All Night"" (Which are all available as 12"" extended remixes), and ""I'm In Pieces"". You'll love ""Real Love"", ""Rocket To God"" and ""Soul Love"" too.I would bump my rating up to 5 stars if this album didn't sound so 'perfect'... But as usual, there's something for every fan of great music from the best in the business right here."
4,"Good, But Side One Is Better Than Side Two","Side one features Everything Your Heart Desires(3), Missed Opportunity (29) and the lesser known Downtown Life (31). Everything Your Heart Desires was the group's last top ten hits. (So Close only made it to #11 and Do It For Love reached #1 on the Adult Contemporary Charts in 2002). The other two songs on side A, ""I'm In Pieces"" and ""Talking All Night"" are also real gems. Rockability from side B is the best track of side B. What I like most about Rockability is how Daryl and John share the lead vocals which is what made ""She's Gone"" was such a great song. ""Keep On Pushin' Love"" is the only song on the album fronted by Oates alone. It closes the album. I usually skip the three songs between. As much as I enjoy the accoustic guitar effects on Rocket To God, the words and melody are bland and forgettable. Real Love and Soul Love, almost sound like the same song. That may be incidentally why they bleed into eachother."
5,One of their Best!,"OMG this CD is totaly awesome! I love the flare and flamboyance, especially ""Rockability"". A must own for all 1980's graduates!"
5,My favourite H&O album,"For me, this was H&O; at their creative best. The story goes that only one track was written outside of the studio.The rest just evolved on a mushroom fueled blowout with Dave Stewart. Some of the band walked out in frustration... But the end result is, dare I say it their Sergeant Pepper.Even after all these years and a thousand playings it still sounds fresh, vibrant and danceable.Shake your booty!"
1,"Boring, But Great Music",This documentary was pretty boring but the music was great. i enjoyed listening to the music. but all in all the film was pretty boring.
1,deep blues,i was disappontet because i could not see the film because it has an us country code wich dosent work in denmark..what to do?
4,The Real McCoy,"Hippy-dufus journalist Robert Palmer & quasi-famous rocker Dave Stewart wander around the south in search of roots-blues and boy, do they ever find it! The music is sublime and when they get out of the way and let it speak for itself, the film soars. When they don't, well..."
3,Almost but not quite...,"Some great stuff here - the foot age of a younger RL Burnside is priceless.I received it at the same time as ""You see me laughin?"", which blew me away. I guess I prefer a grittier style of blues - a lot of the music was more polished than I like, in a BB King way - but there IS interesting stuff all the way through.The narrator is odd, but loves what he is doing - hats off to him.Having said that, it was made in 1990, and if not for this we would never have met RL or Junior.And as for Dave StewArt...... at least his heart was in the right place."
4,Very good shoe for the money,"I have tried all brands of running shoes over the last 30 years... and have found Nike to be superior to all others in terms of fit and durability. I got this Adidas shoe to use as my racing shoe based on a strong rating by Runner's World combined with its good price. It is built for training but is much lighter than the Nike shoes I actually use for training. My only complaint is the arch support digs in a little bit (otherwise, 5 stars). That said, if money was no object, I'd stick with Nike.The best news...it doesn't even feel like I have a shoe on when racing!"
4,shoes,"I bought these shoes because I have a foot condition (it happens when you get older). It does what I need, gives good support and comfort and looks great. I have always had good results with Adidas shoes and will continue to buy them."
5,"I loved Karen, and still do.","I was eleven years old when this LP came out. i had rec'd a record player for christmas and my birthday being the following year in January (1970) I was given a choice of the Carpenters, Ticket to ride or an Osmond Bro's record (I don't recall which one). I had wanted both, but could only have one (we weren't rich, after all) :)I chose the Carpenters and never looked back. I collected all their LP's into adult hood. I cried for days when my sister broke the news Karen had died. I mourned like the rest of the world. I still love her and Richards music and am very glad the LP's were Remastered into CD's. I have finally afforded to finally collect all of them, now as a CD library. (i'm still not rich :)).I still have the LP's, although no longer have a record player. But I will never part with the LP's. They are part of my childhood into young adulthood.Oh, and as far as the Osmond Brothers? I gotta say, Osmond who? :)"
5,CLASSIC CARPENTERS !!!,THIS IS CLASSIC CARPENTERS .... A MUST FOR ANY KAREN / CARPENTERS FAN ... LIKE ME !!!
4,All of my life I've been listening.....,"Just listen to the invocation on this album and then to All of my life. Then you will know why The Carpenters became so popular and still are. Karen's voice on Someday will be forever haunting my mind. It's just incredibly beautiful. And if you're driving your car just let Nowadays Clancy can't even sing bubble out of the speakers. For a career which was only starting, this album already was a landmark! Roger - The Netherlands."
5,Hunting for the Mousa Lisa...,"This is about as close as you'd want to come to seeing Sherlock Holmes investigating the theft of the Mona Lisa (because Basil is a bit more fun, and the history of the Mousa Lisa is more interesting).This book is worth picking up, just for the sake of the story of how the Mousa Lisa came to be painted (I won't spoil it for you by trying to summarize it here, but it's touching). Someone has managed to substitute a forgery for the real Mousa Lisa, and the substitution was detected only due to the zeal of a visiting art expert. Basil and Dawson have been called in to track down and recover the painting, but of course things are more complicated than they seem..."
3,"Great product, poor advertising","I purchased these slippers for my wife. They came, and the outside is very soft, and the inside is silky/satiny (I apologize for my lack of knowledge in fabrics), but they came size ""medium."" Unfortunately, she needs a larger size, but there was no way to request this in the ordering process. So, I would really recommend the product, but maybe wait until amazon has the choice in size option ready on their website (unless of course the intended wearer is a medium)."
5,Dirt Cheap lp bridge,"What can I say, it's just what I needed, it's a very good looking piece and I'm not really shure yet, but I even think it actually made my guitar sound a little bit better, I own a Washburn WI64 (not a gibson though), anyway, great piece!"
2,Don't waste your time,"I can't believe I blew seventeen bucks on this CD. Tyner's work on Coltrane's albums was lovely, but this is a self-indulgent, mindless hammer job on some beautiful songs which deserved better. I can't help but think that Tyner was unstrung by his grief when he recorded this. A bummer."
4,I LIKE it...,"I am sure most of You have heard something similar before,but if you just wanna chill out to some nice beats give ""The Art Of Flipping Channels"" a spin."
3,Sounds like Johnny preparing to die -- 10 years ago,"This album came highly recommended to me, and it disappointed me somewhat. Sure, it is much better than his other 80's records (it sounds great, which mars his other great 80's record, ""Johnny 99""). But the record should be titled ""Johnny Cash and his Friends."" The album showcases other talents (Emmylou Harris, Rosanne Cash, Paul McCartney, Hank williams Jr.), and the material Cash works with is subpar, but elevated only because of the earnest feeling he put into the recording. The album has a mourning sound -- like Cash was preparing to die. It's ironic, because 10 years later, he's still alive and kicking."
5,Definitely Something to Sink Your Teeth Into,"This book challenged me in a way that few books have ever done. As I read it, I kept going back and rereading sentences and paragraphs, trying to grasp exactly what was being said. I wasn't always successful but my lack of understanding made me want to keep reading rather than to simply give up. The challenge was not just intellectual but personal, deeply personal. If you're tired of melodrama, hype and banality in your daily life then this book might be for you."
5,Good fragrance.,"If you want a soft fragrance that lasts all day, you have to buy the Boss Soul which is excellent. You can buy with confidence that you will not lose your money. Excellent!"
4,Cool Stuff,"Everything is nice. Certainly, HB Soul is a COOL but strong cologne,Cologne lovers: buy it, spray it and have more cats around !"
4,Fragile cap,"The bottle shape makes it prone to falling on its side, and the cap has a retaining ring for the spray, which breaks easily when the bottle falls.But the scent is great, maybe more suited for night use and going out than for the office, but not so strong that annoys: It is very elegant."
2,One Hit Wonder,"While the toy itself is compact and the voice on it not to loud, I would never pay 30 bucks for this thing. I got it at a discount store for five dollars. And that's all it's worth. It has about 5 phrases it will say when you touch the latch and does sing the song when your child presses the smile. That's it. Wouldn't the biggest thrill of playing with ""the mailbox"" be finding a letter? You would think so but it does not open! So kind of a pointless toy if it doesn't even do that."
2,WAAYYY over priced!!,"Cute little toy...but TOO pricey. It does nothing except sing the MailBox song and say a few phrases...that's it. And it's small. Only about 5 inches. Don't pay $26.99 for it when you can get it for $2.49 at The Christmas Tree Shop. At that price, it's worth it."
5,i love this movie,"we love this movie, so much that we can watched it on TV and bought it instantly because we couldn't find it on Netflix. one more to our collection"
4,Travesty That This Never Saw A Full Release!,"While it may never achieve the transcendent status that Shawshank Redemption has (nor should it), this is still a taut, well directed, well scripted, and well acted prison drama. Will definitely be keeping an eye on this writer/director, and hope the lack of full release despite positive reviews, won't keep him from getting future projects financed."
4,Inspired by actual events,"I don't know if the actual story here is based on anybody, but the guards making prisoners fight in the SHU unit actually happened in Corcoran state prison in California. I think between 1989 and 1995. I'm pretty sure that this was meant to be Corcoran even though I don't think they actually made any reference to it. Especially because when Porter is leaving from Protective Custody he passes by a cell with someone who looks eerily like Charles Manson even has the swastika on his forehead (1:37:38) and when jackson is talking to the warden about John Smith arriving he wants to put him in the protective custody with Manson. Manson has been at Corcoran since 1989. Even though the timeframe is off because when they are interviewing Collins, Jackson refers to Shock and Awe which happened in 2003."
3,Predictable and a little farfetched!,Typical prison movie centering on an unjustly jail carpenter who overcomes prison politics and a corrupt guard unit to gain his freedom.
2,Good movie but......,"Will somebody please explain to me why movies HAVE to be made with that distracting camera movements.The movie itself was good but I literally get ""sea-sick"" with all that ridiculous camera swaying. They insist on swinging the cameras from face to 1/2 face to top of heads and then back to 1/2 faces, etc.....WHY DO THEY INSIST ON DOING THAT!It adds NOTHING to the film and is very distracting."
3,very decent flick,"i was surprised by how much i liked this film. val kilmer was great as always and the story line although a bit romantic, was still entertaining. you can buy it for not much more than a rental...so just get it...you wont be disappointed"
4,"""This court sentences you to three years in state prison. ""","Outstanding flick, Stephen Dorff has always been underated but he delivers a powerful performance in this film of a law abiding citizen that gets caught in the trap of the legal system for the audacity of protecting his family from a burglar.Never knew Val Kilmer was so damn ugly, hell he looks like W.C.Fields fer chrisakes, but gives a chilling performance as a lifer who becomes a mentor to Dorff's character. One of the better modern prison flicks. 4 shanks"
4,"""The most electrifying and shell shocking movie I've seen this year.""",The second best film I've seen for the year and I've seen a lot. I have been right in my choices of the annual academy awards winner for 9 out 10 movies during the past ten years. I'm surprised that Val Kilmer didn't even get nominated for best supporting actor for this years Golden globe. Was that really Val? This movie has two of the best QUOTES I've ever heard and I will make sure it's a part of my collection.
4,A rough movie with a gentle story line,"I like this movie becasue of the action. The in depth story line of various characters, and the justice that was served at the end."
1,Bit of a let down...,A purchase based on the 'Nightmares' excellent last two albums...what a disappointment.
5,Painting the Clouds With Sunshine,"Gene Nelson does some wonderful dancing, especially the one where he plays the trumpet while dancing with Virginia Mayo. And Dennis Morgan's singing, especially with Lucille Norman, is beautiful. Never heard Lucille Norman before, but she has a beautiful voice. Love this video."
2,SOUCI,HelloThere is a problem on this dvdIt stopped after 20 minutesCan you send me an other one pleaseThanks so muchERIC WAROUX8 IMPASSE DE LA CROIX17390 LA TREMBLADEFRANCE
4,A nice trip down memory lane,"Light, interesting production, Toni Tenille's strong voice, all remind you of the best of 70's AM radio."
1,Oops?,"This version of one of my favorite poems seems to have one small problem - the poem itself seems to be missing! The notes are great, however."
1,No poem.,"This refers to the version: Public Domain Books (March 17, 2006)The book's configured first page is set to the introduction, not to the cover, so that the reader must turn back through much of the frontmatter in order to get to the Table of Contents.The Table of Contents links the many Cantos, but the Cantos are empty - the actual poem is missing.The Footnotes and End notes, which comprise the body of what is downloaded, are thorough but not actually recorded in the TOC.This is a horrible edition. Please, please do not waste the time downloading it."
5,Good stuff,"This independent label CD retro sound is very engaging. It brings me back to the rocking greats of yesteryear with the ""raw"" power of the power chords, uncombed riffs and hooks. Despite the retro sound and mix, it features a load of fresh ideas. It's good to get your hands on something that doesn't copy the on-going drone of the contemporary pop/rock sound and instead marches to its own irreverent drum.No apologies here. No compromises. Just straight up rock."
2,"I learned a little, but the book's out of date.","This book, written ages ago for MAX 1.2, doesn't do the job now that MAX is up to v2.5. While I did learn a few interesting tricks, for the most part I was dissapointed. Several tutorials contained blatant errors or would not work as explained. Most of what you learn here, you learn by fixing the author's errors or figuring out the things he forgot to tell you. Add to that the fact that it's out of date, and it adds up to a definite last resort resource book."
2,"Not the greatest, but it has some value","Overall, I was disappointed with the content of this book. While providing useful information to the seasoned pro, I found that it glossed over too many details during the course of the tutorials (i.e., they show you a picture and just say ""adjust yours to look like this"" without actually telling you how they did it). This might be okay for a veteran MAX user, but for a beginner, or even intermediate user, I think they just left too much out.On the other hand, the tutorial subjects were excitingly diverse, from creating a kangaroo to creating and animating a space rover type vehicle. I just found that it didn't do it for me."
5,Kewl!,"This CD is really good! I know the lead singer, he's my best friend's brother. This CD isn't big yet, but it will be!"
4,no title,"It works. Doesn't fix my hardware problems, but at least my pc tower gets power now. The female end is snug and shouldn't disconnect randomly. 6ft is fairly short, so make sure the outlet you want to use is close to the computer/monitor it needs to connect to."
1,Did not work for PS3,"Bought the cord for my boyfriends PS3 and it did not fit. Good timing on shipping, returning it will cost more than what it was purchased for so I'm stuck with it. Hope this helps!"
5,Great customer service,"Hello I am typing in reference to the 3 Prong PC cord. I Just wanted to say thanks for the fast service and great handling of my item, I was extremely satisfied with the result and will DEFINITLEY be buying from here often."
5,A Very Helpful Guide,"For any student of sociology, this is a welcomed addition to textbooks. The dictionary is also a good addition to the library of someone who just enjoys reading sociology books. It has a bit of a British flair because of its authors, but is really a well-rounded and insightful reference book."
3,Jennifer Love Hewitt is all the money!,"The movie sheds light on a mother and daughter who try to con men out of large amounts of money.The plot has elements of both comedy and drama making it rather difficult to label it as one or the other; it's actually a bit of both.The acting is pretty good (but nothing great), while the humor and the plot are just about average.Though the potential for a great movie was definitely there it fails to take off. A shame really...In a nutshell, it's an ok movie, and that's about it; it lacks that extra something to put it over the top. No masterpiece here."
3,The Breasts... again,"Rent it for the opening scene, wipe the sweat from your brow then proceed to watch this movie like a moral citizen should.J-Lov with clothes on is sexier than most mature women with theirs on. I was choking during the bend over scenes. She acted this remember so she is talented and blessed with a nice body."
2,"Jennifer Love Hewitt SHOWCASE, and nothing else.","How tired I am of reading people saying how HOT Jennifer Love Hewitt looks in this movie. Yes, it is very true, but this is really not enough to be called a MOVIE, but perhaps a skin-flick in disguise. Hewitt parades her body and performs actions that should have given this movie an ""R"" rating, and not PG-13. Though they may not SHOW all of the sexual acts, they are certainly not subtle, and think about it, should a 13-year-old really be watching and emulating such acts? I certainly hope not.I gave this movie 2 stars because I had a few laughs and did enjoy the ending. Oh, and yeah, I'm a male and I certainly enjoyed the Hewitt views, but if you're a sex-starved male looking for some young skin I'm sure there are other movies out there that may satisfy your cravings even more, so I add, what really was the point?"
2,hackman is funny,"This is a mildly funny but predictable comedy saved from total oblivion by the hilarious performance of Gene Hackman, as an elderly and ill tobacco baron and would-be dupe of two women aiming to bilk him out of his fortune. Sigourney Weaver is quite skilled in her role as a mother who has taught her daughter (Jennifer Love Hewitt) never to trust men and to use them for all they are worth. Having just pulled off a scam on Ray Liotta to get his fortune, the women set out to deceive just one last time. Although Hackman is a laugh riot in this role and Weaver is lukewarm-funny, Love Hewitt is annoying and her obvious/predictable ""love story"" leaves one sick to the stomach. Mindless entertainment."
1,i have not received item yet can you tell when it will ship?,i have not received the dvd yet can you tell me when it will ship?
2,Only Half of this Movie is Worth Watching,"This had a good premise, good actors to play the parts. Sigourney Weaver,although a little long in the tooth to be playing a fem fatale, is competent and Hackman stole the movie with his nicotine drenched old rich guy. When these two actors were on the screen, it was watchable indeed. The big snoozer in this movie was Jennifer Love Hewitt whose only noteworthiness was big silicone implants in tight clothing.Whenever she came on the screen away from Weaver, the movie fell flat ASLEEP! She has neither the talent, charisma or looks to carry a movie by herself (so,we haven't seen much of her lately have we?)This movie is watchable IF you rent it and fastforward out the parts with Hewitt. The scams Weaver pulled were fascinating and cutting out Hewitt and concentrating on Weaver desperately looking for an old rich guy with one foot in the grave and the other on a banana peel would have been a better story."
4,Really cute movie,"I really just watched this movie for Jenifer Love Hewit, but it was a good way to spend my time. Jenifer Love Hewit by the way has a standing invitation for my HOT TUB anyday. I laughed a lot during this movie, Jene Hackman played his part perfectly."
2,Examine that head carefully,"It's a rule of thumb that seldom steers you wrong: if a video cover shows the actors, who were obviously photographed at different times, crudely montaged together, the movie is going to stink. And, if that wasn't enough of a clue, carefully examine Ms. Weaver's glamorous head. Doesn't it seem just a bit too large for the sleek body it sits atop?I normally wouldn't lead off my review with such trivia but, sad to say, it's the most interesting thing about this sourball of a comedy. I suppose it's the only game in town if you want to ogle Jennifer Dugs Hewitt's cleavage so if that's your kink, godspeed.(The actresses' commentary on the DVD offers a nice illustration of their personal differences. While Ms. Weaver ponders the Gene Hackman character's resemblance to Malvolio in Shakespeare's ""Twelfth Night"", Ms. Hewitt rues that her butt looks so large in a certain pair of white slacks.)"
3,Think of it as a female DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS,"Heartbreakers (2001) Sigourney Weaver, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Gene Hackman, Ray Liotta, Jason Lee, Anne Bancroft, Jeffrey Jones, Nora Dunn, Julio Oscar Mechoso, Ricky Jay, Sarah Silverman, D: David Mirkin.Lengthy but funny comedy about mother-and-daughter con artists who first lure him to the altar as the other lures him into temptation, and then a divorce settlement leaves the women with the money.The cast looks to be having a good time, which can get your mind off some of the spotty humor; Hackman is at his most repulsive as the ladies' newest target, a wheezing, filthy-rich tobacco tycoon.Running Time: 123 minutes and rated PG-13 for sex related content including dialogue."
3,Funny,"Quite Funny, i watched it twice and still can laugh. but the script is doing male characters harrasement by telling that ALL males are dumb, stupid, & sexual oriented that can be fooled easily by women. but overall aspects of the movie is good and funny, should watch it."
4,Great quality,this was the first time that we had used Amazon's instant stream rental program and it worked great! We watched in HD and there were no interruptions! Thanks!
3,Does Not Stand the Test of Time.,"Gene Hackman and his brilliant performance steal this film. It was a funny film and somewhat overlooked when released. When he meets his cinematic fate, the film dies with him. It somehow has not stood the test of time. Rather unfortunate. Always good to see Ray Liotta. This film does have its moments, just the same."
2,"Mediocre, At Best","A friend recommended this movie to me, and I basically watched it because I'm in a major Sigourney Weaver phase right now, but was very disappointed with the quality of the piece. Yes, there were parts where I laughed, but overall it was a let down. Nothing was laugh-out-loud funny either, and a lot of the points that I found funny were more so from being awkward points. The acting was pretty good but the plot line was not very amusing and did not hold my interest for very long. It is not the worst movie I've ever seen but I would not recommend it, it's really not even worth the 3 buck rental. And for a ""light"" romantic comedy it was a little on the long and drawn out side as well. Not exactly horrible, but not very good either."
2,Highly disappointing,"I thought with this great cast and this funny premise they could make SOMETHING out of this movie, but sadly they did not. Other than a few good one-liners (thus two stars rather than one), this movie stinks. Cliches galore, bad jokes, bad acting, and bad writing. If you want to see a good con-artist movie, get Dirty Rotten Scoundrels with Steve Martin & Michael Caine. Heartbreakers is not worth 90 minutes of your time."
5,Ba-da-bing! Love those romantic comedies!,"I've watched Sigourney Weaver for years now, (ever since Alien) and I am amazed at the range of rolls and characters she beleiveably crafts for her audience. Sigourney is one of the finest story tellers ( It's what actors do, after all) I have seen. Having Gene Hackman as a co-star does'nt hurt either! Gene is another great story teller who will make you beleve. Heartbreakers is the story of two con artists who land in trouble when love intervenes in their work. You will laugh your heart out at some of the funnyist secenes on film and you will cry as the movie pulls on your heart strings. A terrific film, and one that is worth every penny spent on it! Bravo!"
4,Incredibly Funny!,"This was a good flick. You may think it's a chick flick.... Maybe it is... But, it is really funny. The dialogue is great. Gene Hackman as an aging tobacco kingpin.... Non stop smoking and hacking.... He played his part perfectly... Sigourney was also great... But the real show stopper was Jennifer Love Hewitt. She is very easy on the eyes...I think everyone should check this one out."
3,"A poor woman's ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels""","For fans of con movies. Reminded me of ""DirtyRotten Scoundrels,"" but not nearly as good. ""Heartbreakers""reaches for too many farcical jokes which hurt the story.I grant that it's very hard to keep a funny moment out of aplay or movie, but discipline is really needed to make acomedy work (unless the entire movie is a string of farcicaljokes, like ""Blazing Saddles."") ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels""succumbed to the temptation once in the middle of the film,and it was a mistake, but unimportant in the overallpicture. ""Heartbreakers"" does it too often, and thecast -- yes, even Gene Hackman who should know better --falls in along with it, turning at times into parodies ofthemselves. It's a fine script, poorly directed, butoverall entertaining enough and a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours."
4,A Pleasant Surprise...,"While I must admit that Jennifer Love Hewitt was one of my main reasons for seeing this film, I was surprised to find myself entertained by this comedy about a mother & daughter con-artist team. Sigourney Weaver plays the mother who lures rich, love-starved men into marrying her. Hewitt, outfitted in an endless array of low-cut, micro mini-skirt dresses, plays her daughter who then seduces the newly-married grooms giving Weaver grounds for divorce-- and accompanying cash settlement!The movie portrays men as nothing more than empty-headed lugs unable to resist a beautiful woman's charms. The tables are turned when Hewitt falls for a normal working-class bartender. As she struggles with her feelings, her relationship with the bartender soon causes havoc in ""the family business."""
3,Does not make it.,"Dialogue is wanting, acting is forced. Light plot but you know the ending after 1/4 of the film is finished. Good to rent, bad to own."
3,Worth watching just to see Jennifer,"This movie is enjoyable enough, but the real reason for any warm-blooded american male to watch is Jennifer Love Hewitt. She goes through at least 20 costume changes and never fails to look absolutely stunning. According to just about everyone involved, Jennifer was playing against type, but it's hard to believe. She wore those tight mini-skirts and dangled that ample cleavage like a seasoned pro."
3,Thanks For the Fastforward Button- Gene Hackman (YUCK!),"This movie seems funnier on DVD than it did when I watched it at the theater, MAYBE because I can now fastforward the parts that show TOO MUCH (trust me) of Gene Hackman in the most disgusting acting part I have ever seen (John Water's movies INCLUDED). Hackman (How Appropriately named for this part!) is a cigarette smoking, worshipper of tobacco products. Gross! Enough about that- Jennifer Love Hewitt is H-O-T!!! Sigourney Weaver and Ray Liotta are fine, but what makes this for me is the chemistry between Jennifer Love Hewitt and Jason Lee; I found the bits with the two of them refreshing and worth watching again. There are funny parts, but the script is only mediocre, which makes me bring up my final point that reconfirms my main reason for watching this movie- - Jennifer Love Hewitt is H-O-T!!!"
3,Silly fun,"I think Sigourney Weaver is one of our coolest actresses, and probably one of the most underrated. Not that this is an Oscar role here---far from it---but she is always interesting to watch. The premise of the movie is good but it never seems to reach its potential. It does, however, have its funny moments. Gene Hackman is hilarious as the tobacco tycoon who pratically breathes and exhales cigarette smoke and Ray Liotta does a fair job as the last man tricked by this mother/daughter con team. It was nice to see Anne Bancroft in a cameo role and would have been better if we could have seen more of her. As it was, there wasn't really anything very funny written for her. Jennifer Love Hewitt fair well as the daughter but she is outshined by Sigourney Weaver. This is not a great movie but its good enough to pass a couple of hours."
5,"Not Only Makes You Laugh Out Loud, But Gets You Thinking!","When I first saw ""Heartbreakers"" on DVD, I was not dissapointed. As well as the film being very funny, the deleted scenes included in the DVD were just as good. Watch for the somewhat strange rendition of ""Back In The U.S.S.R"", as this is a major highlight of the film, especially the full version included in the deleted scenes. The plotlines are very good in the film, and it will keep you guessing right until the end. If you like this film, and are a teenager with a love for dark comedies, I would suggest the films ""Jawbreaker"" and ""Sugar & Spice"" to add to your collection."
4,A fun movie!,"Great acting, lots of fun...an evening of laid back entertainment! I would recommend it to anyone over age 14 ...watch for some content."
3,Meh,"Entertaining, but not intelligent. Performance from the cast was good, but a poor script demeaning women. Women just look like gold diggers."
4,who ever said flaunting got you no where was wrong,"I was skeptical of this movie, just because of the fact that it had Jennifer Love Hewitt prancing around in nothing in it. But alas, it came on a satellite movie channel one day and I decided to sit down and watch it. Page(Hewitt) is a young woman who is trying to free herself of her mother Max(Weaver) and her mother's scams to marry men and then use Page as a bait to get the men into the divorce court and claim their entire accounts. After scamming a hot-car ring boss(Ray Liotta) the girls move on to the expensive likes of Palm Beach, Florida, where a tobacco tycoon (Gene Hackman) is moments from death. This plan goes very good but Page finds herself falling for a guy and her mother realizes that she might still have feelings for her ex-husband. Can they stay true to their lifestyle as conartists or will they pull a nono and fall in love?"
2,Yawn,This movie just about put me to sleep.This film has many of the funny parts cut out.You have to access this parts in the deleted scenes.They should be sued for false advertisement.Since those parts where in the commercial and not in the theatrical release.
4,compact dish drainer,I was looking for a small dish rack for my small sink and I found a few on your site. I am very happy with it.
4,Jsut the right size,"We recently down-sized and I needed a small dish drainer for my limited space. I like the drainer with exception to the fact it needed a little flat space for a cup or glass. Because the draining board does not have a spout, I didn't place it parellel to the sink. I set it against the back slash and that gave me more room. The spoon holder does tend to tip easily, but over all it serves the purpose."
3,Nice little drainer rack,This is a pretty nice little drainer. I cannot seem to be able to remove the plastic water drain attached to the drainer rack. It is big enough for a few dishes and small enough to fit in the small side of my big sink.
3,didn't work for our needs,"In short, we found that the wires running under the center of the rack are placed so close together that it didn't hold our plates very securely. They would tend to roll one way or the other, which did not bode well for keeping our plates in one piece. As a result, we sent this item back and will be looking for a different one."
2,Dish Drainer,"Better Houseware 3423 Compact Dish Drainer Set, Stainless is not what I expected, as does not fit the intended purpose, but will keep it."
1,This thing is tiny. It looks like it's for a doll house! Useless!,"Just useless. This is so small, I don't know how anyone could find it functional. Look at other products, and check the size before ordering."
4,Size fits,Ordered this because of size and it fits and does fine. Would have liked it to have rubber feet to avoid scratching sink which it does not have. Went to HD and bought and glued feet on. Since was limited by size of small sink it is exactly what we needed.
5,so cute! by Alyssa (USA),"hi.this carrier is really cute. it's a perfect accessory to go along with the new baby born. i want both of them for christmas. i know it's wierd that a 12 year old still plays with dolls, but i love them and i don't care what anyone says. my friends don't know exept for my bff and i don't intend to tell them. i've always wanted to be a mom and baby born is almost just like one! great carrier!"
4,not bad,"I heard a track from this album on an online radio station and bought it to play the same on my own online radio station. I didn't expect much from it, as one learns to do with no-name orchestras. While this isn't the greatest musical production ever done, it is impressive. The songs are relaxing, not trying to hard to mimic the Streisand style, and generally well-done. Granted, some of the music is electronically generated, but trust me, this album is better than most of the similar products you buy at discount stores for ""background music."""
5,"""One of the all time greatest Reggae albums""","If you like Bob Marley Legends, you will love this. Great Reggae songs like Mystic Man, Bush Doctor, Reggaemylitis and the best Jonny B. Goode rendition since Michael J. Fox on ""Back to the Future"". A Classic."
3,Not So Tough,"Even though this album was created immediately after Tosh's death, they still could've done better job than this. A few more tracks from No Nuclear War would've hurt. Lessons In My Life and Nah Goa Jail would of did this album some justice. The Day The Dollar Die, Not Gonna Give It Up (Album Version), & Glass House would of also perfected it, and adding The Toughest would've made since. I know that Legalize It and Equal Rights were made on Columbia Records so I understand why they haven't made the line-up. Overall I give it a C.-DJ"
3,ok,"Like other Tosh ""best of"" cds, this one is way too limited in its scope, focusing only on what Tosh did on Capitol records, and therefore eliminates altogether the claasics from ""Legalize It,"" and ""Equal Rights.""While the material chosen is superb, it is what is not chosen that irritates me. There are better, more complete, collections to get, folks."
1,Content may be good but Kindle version is useless,"This isn't a proper e-book. It obviously is just a raw OCR scan without any human 'cleaning up'. I feel I should be given a proper copy for my Kindle when it's appropriately formatted. Riddled with misspellings and 'junk'. Especially when dealing with mathematics formatting is key, otherwise the book is unreadable.Because of this, I am unable to review the actual content of the book."
5,Outstanding jazz from an undersung legend,"Gigi Gryce is one of the best jazz musicians that too few people have ever heard of, and this blues-steeped album contains some of his best work. Though his career barely spanned a decade before he quit the jazz life to become a respected schoolteacher, Gryce was beloved as a performer, writer, and human being by the musicians he worked with. This disc makes a nice companion to the same-titled book, by Noal Cohen and Michael Fitzgerald."
5,This book is terrific,"I have had the good fortune to be able to travel the world and visit many of its most exquisite gardens. The beautiful book by Margaret Hoybach and Joan Brown is another adventure into the world of indescribable color and beauty. Only the most sensitive photographer or highly gifted artist has been able to capture and display the splendor of nature's pallette. In my opinion, the artist can do this better than the photographer, because the artist can better select the colors and manipulate the subject. Margaret Hoybach beautifully portrays the essence of the scene and its delicate lighting. In ""Colors of France"" her technique is masterful. This colorful journey is a sheer delight!"
4,"Not Great, but Not Bad either","I got this case because it pretty much was the only one that served the functions that i needed: belt holster and screen protector. It seems to be well designed, but it lacks a few finer touches.The case is a bit loose around the phone at top and bottom.The Body Gloove logo botton was annoying: quick work with a pocket knife and it was removed. Be careful, there are metal tabs under the little patch inside the case.The side botton access gets some getting used to: the menu button is ok, the down vol one is tougher.The texture of the case is nice, easy to grip and hold.Belt clip take a while to break in, but works smoothly and securely."
1,I can't believe they charge $50 for this JUNK,"""Creative Advertising"" is in full-force with this item. My son received this for Christmas and the whole family was excited by the claims on the outside of the box. WOW, were we disappointed. This basically amounts to a $50 flashlight with a transparency star-map and HORRIBLE focus issues. The 3D ""module"" is a complete joke (basically a cheapo slide projector and not very ""3D"" at all -- I have much better red/blue 3D posters from the 80's). Not only is all of the box text completely irresponsible, even IF they came out and told you what these items REALLY were, they are horrible versions of those items. Honestly, this item is not worth the aggravation -- it's not worth more than $5.00 in my opinion. I will say the audio CD's are very well produced, but not $50 worth of good production."
1,Pretty lame.,"My 11 year old son received this (these) as a Christmas present. He was quite excited about the things that the packaging claimed, ie: 3-D projection, star projection, comet creator, etc.While we haven't yet utilized the audio CDs and commentary, we must report that neither of the projection features is useful due to focus issues and 3-D projection isn't even on par much less costly ""3-D glasses"" style toys."
4,great mediation music,great chanting for yoga or meditation especially since I'm not good at chanting myself. Very easy to focus on the sound. Highly recommended.
4,Great except for the feedback.,"I really enjoy this CD, and have listened to it regularly since purchase. However, several minutes into the first track, a noise starts that really sounds like feedback. It's harsh and a little irritating, but not intolerable. One thing to consider is that I've been listening to this on a poor quality clock radio/cd player. Perhaps it is unnoticeable when played on better equipment."
4,Women of the Bible a Winner,"Having read many different types of devotional studies, I was pleased to find that Women of the Bible by Ann Spangler & Jean E. Syswerda exceeded 90% of them in content and readability. Not only did I find this book very well written, but it is thouroughly grounded in solid biblical principle. The reader starts the week off with a women from scripture, not just the ones everyone is familiar with, but others also. One such study is of Rizpah, a concubine of Saul's. On Monday you learn her story...On Tuesday you read of her life and times. Wednesday covers the legacy she has left in scripture, Thurdsay covers her promise and Friday ends with an overview of scriptural references and devotional questions. I originally picked this book up for myself. However, I liked it so well that I have already given three out as Christmas gifts and I am ordering 2 more copies for others. I highly recommend this book."
5,Good for small group study,I am using this in a women's Sunday School class. The women are enjoying the stories and we are able to link the issues that arose in these Biblical women's lives to our own. Great study!
5,This is an AMAZING Devotional!!!,"I received this daily devotional a few weeks ago and have greatly enjoyed every day of it. This is a perfect Monday-Friday daily devotional for people with limited to extended amount of time to spend. You can go as indepth as you want. Each week focuses on a different woman of the bible and goes into the story as told in the bible, relating it to the times of the bible and relating it to our time today. It also presents God's promises for us as seen in these stories and provides us with simple prayers to present to God. LOVE IT!!!!"
4,Great Book,"I enjoy this book very much. It is a very good study of the women in the Bible. It goes through from the beginning to the end, in order, explaining each woman's role."
5,great book,this is a very modern way of presenting stories of women in the bibe absolutely love this book and will read it over and over again
5,Women of the Bible,This is an amazing devotional. I received it as a gift for Christmas 2007 & bought this one to give to a friend.
4,Women - Bible,this is a helpful book to take a better look at the women who are mentioned in the Bible. It has been a help.
3,Pleased and disappointed,"This is a wonderful book! However, in the copy I received there were some faded pages that were difficult to read. It was small disappointment in an otherwise very pleasant choice!"
5,Keep Your Head Up,"I'm not usually a fan of maxi-singles but this one is a great addition to my collection...Five fresh mixes of the outstanding ""Lift Up Your Head"" and a dub version to round it out. The Quiet Storm mix is absolutely beautiful with piano and cello (courtesy Third World's Cat Coore) and Dean Fraser on sax. Lovers of reggae and positive music in general, I highly recommend plopping down ... even if you have the album! Everton Blender is surely one golden-voiced, conscious singer...a roots/dancehall combination. This song will become a classic."
5,A Wonderful Album!!,I've been listening to this album almost daily since I got it about three weeks ago. The music is just wonderful and it's perfect to have as background music at work. The sounds of Ulises' wind instruments are just astonishing and I'm very impressed on how this musician was able to create a unique style that is influenced by variety of music styles from around the world. My favorites? Rimpoche 2000 and Sipan.
5,Another big step forward.,"The 3rd in the 5400 line, this model doubles the RAM and hard drive size of the 5410 and like that model, includes a NIC (network interface card) to make networking and fast access connections to the Internet more simple. It also features a CD burner that's twice as fast (16x). More importantly, the Athlon CPU (Central Processing Unit, or 'the brain') is much better than the Celeron CPU found in the lower end models. This will allow for better gaming graphics and faster overall function. Few users would find this machine inadequate."
2,Too good to be true,"I bought the computer at circuit city and it was a nightmare. it freezes up constantly. not very good for games,microsoft office, typing papers,or watching dvd's and on a fast network in college it freezess constantly. I wouldnt recomend it to anyone except and older person who uses the computer for really simple tasks not for college or home users. It will bring headaches and you will only have to buy another computer anyway. i have to buy another computer now. if u are a colege student stay away from it."
4,"Something for everybody, but...","Some arrangements really shine, i.e. every single one by Preston Keys. Others are trying a little too hard to be jazzy and will just annoy the average audience. Level is late intermediate to early advanced."
1,"Stink, Stank, Stunk","This book was nothing more than a collection of far-fetched garble. This author really thinks America is Babylon the great? HAH! That's a juvinile joke at best. I bought the book to see how stupid one person who calls himself an author could be, and sure enough... he's THAT stupid. My recommendation is read ANYTHING but this book. Really! It's that far off base!"
1,DONT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!,This movie is f**king stupid!! Please don't waste your time and money! If you want to watch a good skinhead movie watch romper stomper!! And for the record skinheads are not all racist!!
4,MADE IN BRITAIN THE MOVIE,THIS MOVIE IS A GOOD MOVIE STARTS OFF SLOW BUT IF YOU LIKE DECENT MOVIES THIS ONE IS NOT BAD I WOULD SAY BUY IT IF YOUR THINKING ABOUT IT IT'S WORTH IT!
1,not what i expected,"amazon recommended this movie based on other purchases and obviously they had me pegged wrong. this movie was not what i thought it was going to be. if you like movies about racist youth without any moral, this is your movie; if not, don't waste your time. there wasn't even a good story line or any action in it. i expected it to have something good to it because tim roth was in it, but it left us with nothing. would not recommend this movie."
1,I've seen BETTER skinhead movies,"I can't believe I wasted my money on this movie. It was not interesting at all, but rather boring.'This is England' and 'Romper Stomper' are better movies. I suggest you watch those, instead of wasting time on this movie."
4,Classic Roots,"Bob Marley's favorite band? Yup...The Meditations were that and for good reason. Classic roots style from one of the premier harmony trios. Good collection of their classics, and a good place to start. 4 Stars.Loses a Star because it doesn't include the stellar 'Standing On The Corner' from the Greatest Hits collection. Also check out the reissue of Guidance."
2,"Contemporaries of Bob, but that's all","I bought this album on the strength of the two reviews above. I respect the opinions of the reviewers above, but in my opinion the songwriting is really weak.The songs are extremely repetitive and simple - and not in a pleasing way. Unlike some classic dub, where some the groove can become hypnotic through repetition, the focus of this work is largely harmony based, and the simple lyrics and repetitive melodies merely become cloying, old and irritating.There wasn't a single track on the album I liked enough to listen to again - aside from ""Woman is Like a Shadow,"" which is already on a compilation I own (and highly recommend) - ""Hit Bound: The Revolutionary Sound of Channel One."""
4,I was there,"Jam up book.. But then again I was stationed at 8th and I.. and I use to ride motorcycles and drink with Terry and he rest of them in the book.Worth reading if you were stationed at 8th & I.. or any barracks detail.Semper Fi..Dan ""FISH"" Fisher1981-1984 Marine Barracks 8th and I"
4,Not your normal military novel.,"Not what I was expecting, but it came together in the end. Would recommend the book."
3,A unique read,"I have read other things by Lawrence Sanders that I really liked, so when I saw the Tapes as highly rated/respected and a big seller, I just had to get it! However, I thought it lacked true suspense, and the diary-type narrative with rotating perspectives (which I've never been a fan of in the first place) kind of got in the way of it. Just my personal opinion."
1,anderson tapes,"i know, it is a very old book but even giving it that---terrible! i threw it out and i never do that."
4,Works,"Has a smokey aroma, works with all sorts of food, and a little goes a long way with this which is good since it is only 4oz of the stuff. Should make my salmon taste a little richer."
1,Colgin LIquid Smoke - don't bother,"I've used this many times and each time it's been a huge disappointment. The flavor is weak and dissipates really fast. Wrights Liquid smoke is better in every way, however, it's not easy to find these days.I won't buy Colgin Liquid smoke again.Randy"
4,Good stuff,Been using this sauce for years and is an excellent product so I'd recommend it to all who like the smokey flavor.
4,wonderful,This tool belt is a huge hit with my 2 1/2 yr old son. It is high quality and is practically nicer than my husbands. It hold all his tools and toys and he really enjoys using and playing with it.
3,A questionable product,"Well, you know those orientals......make it for an americancompany at a much lower price,,,,pay cheap labor and we allbuy it. Well, I did this time. So far it is still questionableif it will hold up. After putting in the batteries we could notget it to work. It seems if you lift the scale by the pole, thewire will disconnect. Well I laughed when reading the instructions..... talk about improper english!!!! Oh well, I still can not find anything like it here in the good old USA."
2,DID NOT LAST LONG,I bought this scale in January 08 and it died on me today. Cheaply made and unfixable.
2,BUSTED,"In all fairness, I can't assess this item as it never worked from the getgo. It looked fine, well finished and sturdy. Unfortunately it was the last one so I could not get a replacement. I would certainly have preferred a replacement to a refund. But...c'est la vie."
1,scale,I really liked it until it stopped working. I did not even have it a year when all of a sudden it just would not turn on so I just threw it away.
4,A scale that is a piece of Chinese junk,Want a scale that mesures in kilograms and not pounds?Want an instruction pamphlet that is a poor Chinese to English translation?Would you like to have a scale that even when placed properly on a hard level floor tells you that you weigh about half of what you know you really weigh?This if the scale for you!
2,"Great Story but surprised at publishers typos, mistakes ;","I am truly surprised at G.P Putman's sons butchering of this work by obvious typos, printing mistakes.Can't say as I blame Griffin for changing his nome de plume so often-- he evidently could not find a decent printing house. These errors detract from professionalism. ""Rush to publish?"" --its a re-print! Putnam had from 85 to fix it."
4,stephanie seymour's beauty secrets for dummies,"This book is amazing. It has everything you need to know. hair, makeup, and skin. This book is terrific and fantastic. I could not live without it."
1,SKIP THIS ONE,"This album is monotonous and rather flat in affect. Tret Fure is a better ""duo"" singer. Although in her duets with Cris Williamson, it is obvious who carries the depth of the album,(not Tret!)she seems to add a nice supportive voice. I had two of Tret's solo albums that I gave away after listening to them once. Maybe it's a good thing she has gone on to other things."
5,Tibetan Singing Bowl,Very impressed with this CD - have listed to singing bowl sounds before which become monotonous but this one is great !!
4,Good meditation CD,This is a good addition to our yoga class meditation CD collection. Very effective at helping to reach deep relaxation. We will be using it freqently.
4,soothing sounds for meidtation,I bought this CD because I needed some new music for meditation.This certainly did the trick! it is also good for listening to if you want to fall asleep without taking anything. very calming and soothing.
5,A BEAUTIFUL HEALING SOUND,"I HEARD THIS CD IN EUROPE,A FRIEND AND A VERY GOOD DOCTOR USE IT FOR MEDITATION AND I LOVE IT.I FIND IT RELAXING AND HEALING"
2,"low fidelity, lots of hiss which detracts","low fidelity with a LOT of back ground noise , that first I took to be white noise.By the time you get the EQ adjusted to kill the hiss , it dampened the clarity of the bowls.Sort of like AM radio mediatation.sigh.This detracts from it's ability to entrain, sadly, because it is otherwise nice.But, hey, 1.98$.I would have been chagrined if it was more."
4,Sound to Meditate On,A seamless sounding of Tibetan Bowls to inspire balance and peace. An excellent tool to enhance the quiet of the soul.
3,Healing Bowls,"This CD was what I was looking for to further my meditation routine,I would suggest a little more variety of bowls and C.D skips on my player (not my equipments fault)maybe the quality of product."
4,singing bells,"Despite the first track which is a single struck bell/gong being quite long, I found this track useful as an introduction calming stage before meditating with the second track. I read a review that the first track was disappointing and I would add that the ringing is more frequent than I had anticipated. Like the ripples coming from a drop of water onto still water - this is how I found the first track- the ringing resonance carried on for some time after being struck."
4,Great gift for those who meditate.,I bought this CD as a gift for my daughter. She loves it and she's very discriminating; she would tell me if it wasn't good. She and her friends use it regularly for meditation. I am now considering buying one for myself.
2,Ehh...,"It wasn't for me. It was too repeatative. The same sound kept repeating - it's suppose to be this way sometimes and I admit that I am new to all of this meditation stuff, but I like it when there is more variation in sounds."
3,Not all singing bowls,For the most part I am pleased with this cd although I was initially a bit disappointed with the first track which is nothing but a single bowl being gonged at regular intervals. I tend not to use the first track for this reason- it is a bit monotonous and I was hoping for an array of chiming tibetan bowls rather than a single gong-type sound (after all they also make a gong cd). The second track is actual singing bowls and is what I had expected out of the cd. If both tracks were like this I would have rated this product a 4 or 5.
2,Poor Labeling on product.,"I needed a two pound weight to wrap around my ankle for physical therapy exercises. When the weights arrived, there were two separate one-pound ankle wraps. They can be used together, but it is awkward and not ideal. I looked carefully for more product info before ordering, but none was available. They are very nice 1-pound weights, but not what I was really looking for!"
4,Wonderful music,"This CD has some of the most beautiful music I've heard in a long time. I never really paid much attention to Mandy Moore in the past, thinking her simply another Britney knockoff (who I'm not really that fond of either). However, I now have an immense respect for her vocal talents. While Christina Aguilera has raw vocal power (impressive to say the least), Mandy Moore's voice is simply angelic. Her rendition of Only Hope is stirring. I can't stop listening to it. A great job."
5,"GREAT CD! I LOVE THE BOOK, MOVIE & THE SOUNDTRACK!!!",I got the soundtrack 2 weeks before reading the book twice within 5 days and seeing the movie. I am in love with all 3! This CD is great -- uplifting entertaining and reminds you of the great film. I love it and it's not leaving my CD player anytime soon!
5,Mystery Band!?,"I really loved this C.D. Who knew that Mandy Moore had such a beautiful voice? I haven't heard a song on this C.D. that is not absolutly amazing. The only thing is is that one of my favorite songs on the soundtrack is So What Does It All Mean?, but I haven't been able to find the band that sings it (West, Gould, and Fitzgerald) anywhere. I know that it is Shane West's band and that he wrote it but no more info than that. Oh well. The C.D. is wonderful and I definatly recommend it."
5,Love the Music!,I love this CD it is very good.A good mixture of rock and ballads.Mandy has a very sweet voice and its just a very good CD!
5,A Walk to Remember,"I chose this book because I saw the movie of it and I loved it because it was a sad and romantic story. Also the cover of this book had a cute picture of the characters who were the main people. This story is about this girl named Jamie and how she fell in love with a guy named Landon but she has leukemia. She is not worried though because she believes thatit was the Lord's plan and that she has faith that she was meant to go like that.I liked this book because whenI read it, it told me that It does not matter what people say about you, if it is not true, then don't listen to them. Also learn how to ignore them. Jamie did that because she had faith in the Lord and that is all she cared about.My favorite part of the story was that when she did a play in her drama class. Landon was in it to and how she loked was beautiful. It was about a man looking for the perfect gift for his daughter and an angel came and gave it to the man."
1,Why is Cold on Here ? ? ! ! !,"I am trying to understand how a great borderlining melodic death metal band like Cold could be on a pop saturated soundtrack. ""No One"" is great song, but it doesn't at all fit in with Mandy Moore and all of the other no faced pop acts. I love Cold. I own their albums. I go to their concerts. But why are they on this album? I don't know why any metal head would even pick up this album. I was trying to buy a birthday present for my little cousin, and I pick this up and was stunned. C'mon, is Cold trying to fit in with all that useless, no faced pop...? Please tell me no. This is a movie for 12 year old girls. Why is there a heavy metal song on this? I love the song a lot, but I couldn't even give this 2 stars beacuse of the other songs. What happened? Please tell me...-MC"
1,ahahahahahaha,"HA! this soundtrack is ALMOST as funny as the movie! not quite, but it comes pretty darn close. i mean honestly... did i really hear someone say that mandy moore and shane west had fabulous acting skills??? aaah you kill me.... aside from being one of the worst movies ever made, the soundtrack is just a waste of cd cases."
3,a good CD,"Dare You To Move - this song is a good catchy song A-Cry ) - I love this song! its my favorite song out of the whole CD!!! A++Someday We'll Know - Its is a good song...Mandy and Jonathon Foreman sound good togetherB+Dancing In The Moonlight - This song is also pretty good B+Learning To Breathe - This song is good...and it reminds me a little of the song Dare To Move B+Only Hope - This is alos a great song!!!its one of the best parts in the movie when she sings it!!!... Her voice sounds BEAUTIFUL! Its AWESOME !!!~ A+It's Gonna Be Love - Its another one of Mandy's nice catchy songs AYou - Its average BIf You Believe - I personally like the song a lot! It has good lyrics and Rachel Lampa sounds really good when she sings it! ANo One - BSo What Does It All Mean - Its Okey... C+Mother, We Just Can't Get Enough - A catchy song BOnly Hope - It sounds different with a male singing but it still is a good song!!! A"
5,My favorite soundtrack ever!,"This CD is good from start to finish! At first I wasn't too impressed with the ""Rock"" type songs on the soundtrack, but once I gave them a chance, I fell in love with them! Mandy Moore shines on this CD and Switchfoot has some awesome songs also. I like every song on this CD and it is the only soundtrack that I have listened to this much before! I would recommend it to anyone, it is just an awesome CD!"
4,Help?,This was a good soundtrack. It had a lot of good songs and it was not like bubblegum pop either. But one song that I really liked that was misisng was when Landon is getting dropped off at school by his friend for the first play rehearsal. Does anyone know what song that is?
4,I love Mandy's voice,"At first I didn't think she was all that, but boy can this girl sing. She has a voice of an Angel. I give this album 4 stars because I'm still drowning in track 2 and 6. ""Only Hope"" is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO beautiful!!!! I didn't really listen to Switchfoot yet. I will once I kill those two tracks. :) Buy it because ""Only Hope"" is a dream!"
5,Extremly Satisfied,"This soundtrack is awesome! I love the songs ""Cry"" ""Only Hope"" and ""If You Believe"" This CD has my two favorite female singers, Rachel Lampa and Mandy Moore. Even though Rachel Lampa's song wasn't as good as her other songs are, I still enjoyed it. I also enjoyed ""Dare to Move"" it is a good song, but I still don't see what all the fuss is about with Switchfoot. All the songs on this CD are good, except two. They are numbers 11 and 12, I forget their names. Overall, this CD is great, I've played it over and over all the time, since I've gotten it!"
4,Mandy Moore has such talent,"I have to be honest, I don't like Switchfoot much, but Mandy Moore makes this album worth while. I totally like her version of Only Hope better than Switchfoot's! It's a beautiful, touching song. Other standouts are ""Someday We'll Know"", ""Cry"" and ""If You Believe"". Mandy fans, this CD is a must!"
5,Julie K.....awsome movie!,"I havent heard the whole soundtrack.....but the movie was GREAT!!! it was the best movie i have ever seen. the reviews only gave it 1 star...but they dont know what they are talking about. A Walk To Remember is the best movie in the world. i cried soooo much. i have already seen it 2 times and im goin for my 3rd and 4th time this weekend. GO SEE IT!!! the mandy moore songs ""only hope"" and ""cry"" are my 2 favorite ones sice i saw the movie last friday. i think teenagers would luv this movie...and it isnt ONLY a chic flick...i know guys that liked it too. everyone go see a walk to remember in theaters TODAY!!!!Luv alwaysJulie KPS SHANE WEST IS REALLLY REALLLY REALLLY HOTT IN THIS MOVIE!!! GO SEE IT!!!!!!!!!"
5,A Great Soundtrack!,"This soundtrack is an awesome CD to listen to! It is a little sad(probably only if you've seen the movie or read the book) but is wonderful. Mandy Moore is great in this soundtrack, and so are all the other bands/people i.e Rachel Lampa,Switchfoot, Cold, Toploader, New Radicals, and West, Gould and Fitzgerald.This is a awesome CD!"
5,A great soundtrack,"I thought the movie was excellent. As soon as I got out of the theatre, I was wondering who sang all those great songs, and from which CD's they were from. The music is just as touching as the movie, and I definitely think this is a must-have of soundtracks."
5,You liked the movie? Get the Soundtrack!,The Movie is downright beautiful. The music that you hear during the film is exactly what you get on this CD (duh). Mandy Moore and Switchfoot are great. Can't argue much here.Get the Soundtrack!
5,Christian Teenager's View of the Soundtrack,"Before I heard the soundtrack, I thought that Mandy Moore was just another one of the ""bubble gum"" singers whose songs are meaningless. Then I heard this soundtrack. Both Mandy Moore and Rachael Lampa (my favorite christian artist) have beautiful voices and really influence others feelings sbout pop music. This was an excelent soundtrack. I had bought it becasue I have liked Switchfoot and Rachael Lampa for a long time and was expecting to only listen to those songs, but i love them all!"
3,Sweet,"The ""A Walk to Remember"" soundtrack is a CD of sweet music full of love and hope. It served its purpose in bringing even more emotion to the already emotionally-charged film very well. I think that the best track on this CD is Mandy Moore's rendition of Switchfoot's ""Only Hope."" It's a beautiful written song by Switchfoot, and Mandy Moore's soparano voice evokes the emotions of the song perfectly."
4,Review from a singer,"Well being a college trained, professional singer, I must commend Ms. Moore, for stretching her limited vocal chops. She is no Kathleen Battle,or Dusty springfield, but her sweet voice, is much fuller, and stronger than anything Britney could squeak out through a vocoder. The rest of the album has a Christian rock group Switchfoot, and some others I am not too impressed with. I do however like the cover of ""Only Hope"" that Switchfoot does. The song I am refering Mandy moore stretching in is ""Only Hope"", the other songs she sings are the usual pop fare. I think her singing ""only hope"" is definitely worth buying the cd.SO I give it 4 stars for coming really,very, exceptionally close, but getting no cigar."
4,A must for your collection,"I am long time fan of switchfoot...they are an incredible band that will make you want to dance in a fun. Their lyrics will make you think as well. Mandi Moore...has such a beautiful voice. These songs are all great on this album...if you like the switch foot on this album...pick up their ""Learning to Breathe"" album...it is a good one too!!!"
4,A awesome cd,"I love the way Mandy's voice shows that she can sing more then pop on ""Only Hope."" This cd is an great addtion to any pop cd collation, with standout's like ""Only Hope"" and ""Cry,"" and other various songs, by an assrotment of artists."
5,"Reply to ""HELP""","The song you are talking about is ""Mother We Just Can't Get Enough"" by New Radicals."
4,Pleasantly suprised...,"... by both the movie and the soundtrack. I honestly wasn't expecting much with either but, to my surprise, I'm now adding it to my collection. The simple reason is that the combo of songs the disc provides fits the film so perfectly. Switchfoot, ( to me, virtually unheard of in my non-christian exsistence) blew me away with their version of ""Only Hope"" and, at first dismayed that a cover was being done of one of my fav sad songs, "" someday we'll know"" , i was relived that it was done justice...ditto for including New Radicals ""Mother, just can't get enough"" with its peppy piano and postive lyrics. To round it off, when I'm feeling nostaligic and sappy, I have a choice of Mandy Moore tunes to zone out to!With so many soundtracks looking to spin top 40 hits that rarely even appear within the film at all, I'm glad that the soundtrack stayed true to the movie and provided all that I heard on the big screen! Snaps for this one!"
5,Not like most soundtracks...,"Nowadays, soundtracks are poorly pieced together songs that were just the cheapest things anyone could find.This soundtrack is unlike most soundtracks, because it has 13 tracks of undeniably wonderful songs. These songs will remind you of the movie, even the parts that you'd forgotten about.Of course, the beautiful ""Only Hope"" is performed on the soundtrack by Mandy Moore and by Switchfoot. (Both performed it in the movie, and one of the guys from Switchfoot wrote the song, I believe.)Some of the songs nearly bring me to tears because they make me think of the happiness and the sadness of the movie. This soundtrack shows you what a soundtrack should be--full of songs that remind you of the movie and make you long to see the movie again.If you loved the movie, then get this soundtrack. If you just want some inspirational and peaceful music, then get this soundtrack. It's really fantastic!"
4,the christian artists rule!,Great album The christian music on this soundtrack is beautiful not to mention Mandy moore of course But switchfoot and Rachael Lampa have the best tunes on here I love it!
4,Betty Boop check cover,"I like this cover it's cute and changes pictures just like it said. It's kind of flimsy though, but I still carry it. I guess it's worth ten bucks. It's just like the plastic covers you get free with your check orders, but cuter."
5,great product,I have had the velcro rod savers my entire life. They last about a year and get stretched out. I would replace them and go on for another year or so. I purchased these and so far love them. They hold the rods fairly secure and seem to be holding up well. Also these rod buckles require less drilling than the others.
2,"BIG Book, little information.","Lots of words, but little useful information. I want a book that gets to the meat, and this is not it. I have been working with Windows for a long time. I think this book was written for a beginner, but I think it would be too confusing. I found the material very wordy and hard to follow. I got this book because of the reviews, I just don't understand how other give it 4 stars."
2,Not Enough,"I have passed several of the Exams using the books in the series and ""TestOut"" software. But It wasnt enough to pass this exam on the first try. I just purchased Microsofts Training kit for the exam and I found better explanations of the exam questions than in this book."
3,IT Specialist,"The book is very comprehensive and goes into enough depth to cover virtually all the concepts in the 70-216 exam. What kills this book is the lack of concise, clear explanations and assumptions of an expected level of understanding of data networking technology. Please not everyone belongs to a well to do fortune XXXX company that can offer cisco and 3com network equipment labs. On top of that are serious syntax and typo errors which throws off another star for this book. If the book included more exercises like the Sybex book and was carefully critiqued, it would deserve at least a 4 star rating...but sorry you should have done that before carelessly releasing this study guide to the public"
1,The worst,"Do not get this book unless you are new to computers and new to networking, even then it's bad. If you have been in the buisness for a few years this book will either make you laugh or cry it is so bad. So many mistakes, so much redundancy, 100 pages of information in 800 pages of [nonsense]."
3,Disappointed,"I had high hopes for this book based on some of the reviews, but in the end I found myself scratching my head at the unclear explanations of such key areas (e.g. RRAS policies and how they are applied). The book covered all the key subjects (which is more than can be said of even Microsoft's book on 216), but certain topics merit more examples and discussion and this simply wasn't there. (Certificate Services, for example, missed a lot of important details). Even with the labs and hands on, no way is this book alone enough to pass the exam. I used the Microsoft Server Resource Kit to fill in a lot of the holes, as well as some other books, and of course, the Transcender exams."
1,No really what I expected!,"With all due respect to the author, this book will come handy this Christmas sitting by the fireplace.I bought this book to help me in preparing for 70-216, to get more knowledge, informations and so on; thus being confident on the exam.Instead, what I found that it has so many mistakes, so much redundancy, doesn't get straight to the point and uses to many non-sense words. If I could return it, I definitely would."
3,Good for ground up tutorial but should also look elsewhere,"This book covers many of the most of the basics you need to know in the MCSE exam (DHCP, DNS, WINS).However, topics on static routing, OSPF, RIP, multicast routing, certificate of authority are definetely not covered enough. You are not given the picture on how OSPF, RIP, multicast and unicast routing, actually works.If you think you can pass the exam with this book alone, don't bet on it unless you have plenty of experience. My advise on anyone who wishes to take this exam should also purchase the 3 Win2k resource kits (TCP/IP, Internetwork, Distributed System) for a very complete coverage on all the topics covered in this book. With these 4 books, I passed the exam on first try and completed CCNA with ease."
1,trammpoline,I DID QUITE A BIT OF RESEARCH AND THE PRODUCT MET ALL MY EXPECTATIONS. THIS IS MY SECOND TRAMPOLINE AND I AM AWARE OF THE BENEFITS IF USED REGULARLY.
1,DEFECTIVE DVD! TERRIBLE PRODUCT! BEWARE!,"This is terrible! my dvd is damaged or defective. I opened it with clean hands put it perfectly into the dvd player, and 90% of the videos do not work. Please send me a new dvd and i will change this into a good review!"
1,Will not sell to People serving USA overseas.,"I am really sad to say that we tried to buy two (yes 2 ) rebounders but where turned away because we have a PSC address. My Husband is serving overseas, we cannot buy rebounders here.Thanks a lot."
2,Another bad DVD,"I just tried my DVD in two different players and it won't play on either one. I am returning this one and trying another. Hopefully, it will work. To use properly and get all benefits of the equipment the DVD needs to work, useless otherwise."
5,Trampoline Review,"I have an Autistic child who uses this for sensory. This is the best one on the market. He uses it everyday for a mininum of an hour hard, really jumping. WE even have one at school because lots of Autistic kids calm down wit the sensory in put of jumping. I LOVE THIS TRAMPOLINE, as with all trampolines use safety mats and supervise the activity at all time."
4,Better than I expected!,"I was skeptical about purchasing this trampoline,but after I received it, I was pleasantly surprised. It actually looked BETTER than the picture. I didn't have any problems with set up...just opened it up and started jumping! I can't comment on the stablization bar because I don't use it.The workout is KILLER. If you're already in shape, you can probably get thru the basic one. But if you're like me and TRYING to get in shape after years of minimal activity...forget it. I literally thought I would pass out. I have to do a little of the DVD at a time before I'll be able to build up to the full thing. Its much more fun to forget the DVD, put on your favorite music and pretend you're a little kid jumping on the bed! You'll still sweat! Or maybe do some bouncing while watching TV. But basically, I'm pleased."
1,"Wrong item, twice","I ordered this, and received the one without the handle. I returned it, and received again today, the same one, without the handle again. Great crappy service."
3,Ok,"This was ok for a while, but I eventually got bored from it. It can be good if you follow the video but it just wasn't that much fun after a while. It does seem like a good workout."
2,Great concept but had small flaws and REALLY DID SMELL,"This trampoline was recommended to me as high quality, but mine arrived with several rips in the seams on the spring cover. Also, please believe the others who warn you that it SMELLS! The toxic rubber odor was overpowering and sickening. I think it comes primarily from the rubber feet, but having been sealed in the box for so long, the smell had permeated the whole item. I let it air out but still smelled strong. Maybe it goes away after a long while, but I didn't want to wait and find out, especially since this one was torn anyway. Having said that, the springiness was nice and it seemed like it would be a great workout. I took a quick look at the DVD and it seemed like a good program, easy to follow. I plan to buy the DVD seperately and get another brand of rebounder."
4,Handy Workout,"I bought this for myself (65 yr old female) for times I can't get to Curves to work out and for something a bit different. My mom, who's 85, was intrigued and got on and started a light jog. She had previously been quite inactive for the past few years, except for light yard work, but has really enjoyed the rebounder and uses it regularly for 10 minutes or so at each session. She rightfully fears falling, and the stability bar gave her the confidence she needed. I'm really happy about this!The stability bar was difficult to install in the mounts, but we finally succeeded after filing off rough edges of metal on both the mounts and the inserting posts. It would be wise to have a metal file on hand, just in case you run into the same problem!"
2,Good at first but....,"Thr product was great at first but after minimal use to date (2 months) the covering around the outside is tearing and starting to come off-It even gets in the way and can ,make you trip if not paid attention to. Plus, the rebounder is getting a little wobbly and does not seem as stable after 2 months."
5,Great piece of equipment!!,"I bought the rebounder after seeing a friend's; I LOVE it! I am partially disabled and unable to do weight bearing exercise (walking, running), but I can bounce away to my heart's content and am getting great work-outs! This is a really sturdy, solid piece of equipment; well worth the money!!! and it keeps me very motivated to keep up with my workouts."
3,I'm not sure...,"I just got mine. I have the black cover with strange white markings. I took pictures because I am considering returning it. I tried wiping the marks off and they did not just wipe off. I took a wet rag to it. Lots and lots of wiping and I got a small section of the marks off. There were only 2 or 3 styrofoam pieces in the box. If they left all these marks, they were busy little guys!I will try it for a day or so and decide if I will return it. The markings sure make it look bad!!!"
2,"Good While it Lasts, Which isn't Long.","I ordered this trampoline last year for my 11 year old daughter for a fun workout. She only started using the trampoline last month for about 45 mins. a day. Now 13 months after ordering it (the one year warranty has expired, of course) one of the legs has snapped off. I would say it had maybe only six weeks of daily use before it became unusable."
5,GREAT!,I've never had a rebounder before. This one is high quality and easy set up. I'm glad I did my homework before buying.
3,NICE,yes I like it it folds up small for storage and opens quickly.It had a defective bar when it came but I cannot deal with it so I use it without attaching the bar .I like it a lot when i do not feel like going out and running or getting ready to go out .it is quick to get a nice work out .
1,Do Not Buy This Product,"I attempted to open it up when I was hit with the off-gassing stench that has been mentioned before. Not only that, but the frame ends that fit into the joints were crumpled so that I couldn't even assemble it to try it. No luck with customer service - they said they are phasing out this model and may not have a replacement - and if they did have a replacement, it was going to be $30 US to ship it out or more (to Canada plus duty).Really poor customer service! I haven't even tried it to know if it's to my liking!Don't bother. Buy higher quality and save yourself the headache."
1,DON'T PURCHASE THIS,"I MADE THE MISTAKE OF ORDERING THIS ITEM, ONLY TO BE DISSAPOINTEDAND TOTALLY UPSET AT HOW THE COMPANY DECEIVES CUSTOMERS BY RATINGTHIS PIECE OF EQUIPMENT AS AN ITEM USED AT GYMS. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?WHEN MY HUSBAND PULLED IT OUT OF THE BOX THE ODOR WAS HORRIFIC AND HADTO PUT IT OUTSIDE IN ORDER TO PUT IT TOGETHER. THE BANDS THAT HOLD THELEGS STARTED BREAKING OFF AND THE SAFETY BAR CAUSED MORE PROBLEMS AS IT'SVERY FLIMSY AND NOT STABLE. I HAD TO SPEND $30.00 TO RETURN ITEM AND HAVEBEEN WAITING OVER 2 MONTHS FOR MY CREDIT."
1,Missing Part,Trampoline arrived without the handle. Daughter's birthday is in 2 days so no time to return and wait for a new one. Don't want to give her because now we need to send it back. Thanks for ruining the birthday gift.
3,springs break off during jump,"Had been using the Urban rebounder for about 6 months. No problems up till then, Was great for weight loss (60#) and kept my blood sugars with in normal limits with out any diabetic meds (yeah for that) but the springs , 2 of them came shooting out while I was jumping one day. one put a dent in my wall. I was grateful my 2 grandsons (age 2) were not around because the force of the release of springs would have injured them, or anyone else in its path. Very disapointing. And of course when this happened it nearly dumped me off. I have seen where others have had this problem too. That was my only complaint. I loved it up till then.So for me its a safety issue."
4,Urban Rebounder,"I bought this believe it or not for an eighty year old woman at her request. She absolutely loves it. She tells me she does 500 bounces a day. I was more than a little skeptical, but so far she is very happy. The stabilizing bar is a big help."
5,"fun,easy","I use this while watching TV. One of my concerns was if it made a lot of noise. It doesn't make much noise at all so it doesn't disturb others , and I can hear the TV.I like the handle bar because it provides just enough support that I don't feel like I may fall off.Nice product and the price is good seems to be well made."
3,Mostly satisfied,I am very satisfied with the rebounder except for the videos that came with it. The videos came so scratched that they can't be watched. I contacted the company but they never replied to my emails. Very disappointed with the customer service.
3,Great Item!,"This trampoline is durable and able to take on a heavy person. The bar on the trampoline however, is a bit flimsy. I was disappointed in the video since it skipped and just shut off automatically, I am not sure why. Basically, I could not see the video."
3,Bouncer OK.... DVD not working,"the bouncer is working fine, i bought it couple weeks ago... but the dvd has nothing written on it..., cant find anyone that help"
3,it's folding feature requires two people - storage bag not included,"I like the effect of rebounding - even gently for a minimum of just two minutes - it makes me feel better.This rebounder got a little squeaky, but I remedied that with some bike chain lubricant on the rivets that hold thesprings to the frame and on the metal to metal contacts.The folding feature requires two people - according to the instructions.My rebounder didn't include the storage bag that was supposed to be included - or so I thought."
2,Returned this item.,"I purchased this for my wife, who is much smaller and lighter than me. Somehow it was too hard for her, and yet when she bounced on it, her feet went almost all the way to the ground. Also, the foam it was packed with somehow bonded to the paint, and there were white blotches all over it that were not removable. I tried scrubbing them and using my fingernails, but they were permanent. After sharing our disappointment with a colleague, he said that if we were serious about buying a rebounder, to get one that, instead of springs all the way around, that could potentially hurt if you mis-stepped, to get one that had what is essentially a bungee-cord winding back and forth between the trampoline surface and the steel rim. He said these are much gentler and easier to use, but they are a lot more money, on the order of three times what this one cost. We have not yet taken that particular plunge. If this one works for you, then it's sure a lot cheaper. It didn't work for us."
2,Disappointing,"The trampoline is very squeaky. A spring is not hooked properly & it seems impossible without some time of tool to fix it. I received this product & received only 3 of the promised 6 DVD's. None of the DVD's work. I wanted to return the DVD's in exchange for working ones but Amazon would not let me do this. The only way to exchange was to send back the trampoline & the DVD's. This is incredibly inefficient, a waste of gas & resources & a huge cardboard box that will sit in a landfill for thousands of years. A simple envelope to exchange the DVD's would be much more efficient & environmentally friendly.The trampoline does not easily fold up for storage."
3,Rebounder mini Trampoline,was a good deal...but had to sell mine after a few months at a great loss as it Irritated my joints and was not low impact enough for my heavier frame and condition...
1,DAMAGED TORN UP BOX AND MISSING PARTS! 0 stars,"I ordered this ""new"" and it arrived in a twice or more used torn up poorly packaged box.Still hoping it would all be there considering torn holes in ragged box but NO!!!, MISSING PART AND BUSTED SPRINGS ! Then I have to go through all this hassel to RETURN IT as there was NO RETURN LABEL PACKING SLIP INCLUDED! TERRIBLE SERVICE AND CARE !!!!"
3,Flimsy,"The handle is wobbly and unstable, I won't be using it. The trampoline itself seems sturdy, but the legs are held together with elastic cord? who knows how long that will last. I think if I were to buy a small trampoline like this again, I would not buy one that folds."
1,Not For Jumping!,"I purchased the Urban Rebounder in March 2010. In June, the stitching that held the metal to the springs broke. I called the service center. They asked me what I was doing when it broke. I told them I was jumping. I was told that the Urban Rebounder was not made for jumping. The warranty was void because I jumped on the mini-trampoline. I weigh 160 and was on the 300 pound model. If you want to jump, don't buy the Urban Rebounder."
1,Poor Quality Product,"When first time used, two rivets broke causing separation of the two parts at frame pivot folding structure. Poor quality, bad design, this item should be inspected by the consumer safety group.In addition, unit has very strong odor like a kerosene. Of course made in China. I have returned this item without any issue and have my money back."
2,Straps broke one month later,"The urban rebounder seemed constructed well. My 9 year old started doing the workouts with the DVD and within a month, three straps had broken making it unsafe to bounce on. They are sending us another mat. The return was easy."
2,Broken after 6 months,"I purchased the Urban Rebounder after having purchased several less expensive trampolines that broke within months. My 130 pound daughter used the Urban Rebounder for workouts. After our bad experiences with previous trampolines, she knew that she had to be pretty careful if we wanted this one to last. Despite this, springs from the UR began breaking within about 6 months. Eventually we had to throw it away. I can't even imagine what would have happened if a 200 pound person were to use this. I have yet to find a trampoline that holds up for any reasonable period of time. We will probably buy another UR because my daughter loves using it but I will definitely buy it from a store where I can also buy an extended warranty because I have no doubt it will need to be returned within 6-9 months."
4,Urban Rebounder,"I really like the Urban Rebounder, it is the easiest form of exercise I have ever done. Not only is it good for what you can see on the outside of your body, it has tremendous results for the inside of your body. Try it, I'm sure you will find it fun and a simple workout."
4,Good Workout,"This trampoline gives a great workout. I like the size - not too large and doesn't take up tons of space. The handle is perfect for me as I'm concerned about losing my balance. The handle could be a bit more sturdy, but overall I'm very pleased with the performance of the product."
2,questionable quality,"I grew up with a rebounder and love working out on it together with music, so was excited to buy my own. It feels easy, but is great for fitness, fun, and fat burning.However, after using it most mornings for about 4 months, the rubber ""feet"" on started falling apart one by one (so that the metal pokes through and ruins the carpet), and now I have to buy another rebounder. :( I weigh less than 150 lbs, so that doesn't say much for the quality of this particular rebounder! This time I'll buy a different brand!"
1,Rebounder not so hot,"The canvas on the center of the rebounder was ripped when I received it. I called to return the rebounder and was told that I was responsible for the return shipping fees. After spending another $28.00 to ship the rebounder back, I vowed never to purchase something so heavy from the internet without reading all the fine print. They offer warranty services, but I was not happy with the overall quality of the rebounder and did not want to keep it. It moves around on it's legs as you are jumpin and the stabilizing bar moves several inches either way which made me very nervous. I thought for the price, this was going to be a high quality item. It did not appear to be high quality to me - at least not enough to warrant the high price tag (plus the extra shipping to return it!)."
1,Very Poor Quality,I purchased this item based on other customer reviews and was extremely disappointed. The quality is very poor. One of the hinges was actually already broken when I opened the box. I wouldn't have given it even 1 star but you're forced to do so to submit a review.
1,BROKEN AND USELESS AT 10 MONTHS OLD,"I purchased this new in March, 2010. It was used 2-3 times/week average. The fabric that holds 2 of the springs broke today and it is now junk. I would give it no stars. More shoddy workmanship from China."
1,"Urban Rebounder trampolin, broken after 2 days!!","This is our second trampolin workout system. The first one from another manufacturer, lasted 4 months. I thought that was short, but when this last one after 2 days started to brake I could not believe it.I just have to check more reviews before buying the next one."
5,The Gem of Aeronautical literature,"This book is definately the most outstanding source for basic aeronautical science. The author's unique perspective, looking at a 747 as compared to a budgy, is a tremendous help in explaining various concepts, from finesse to fuel economy. Although it is not an intense calculus based textbook, it does a great job of making you understand how and why things occur.Mr. Tennekes analogies between birds and aircraft will make you realize the commanality of the two previously distinct subjects. I strongly believe that no one, or at least not many, ar above this book. With everything from sailplanes to skating, supersonic flight to hovering explained, this book should appeal to anyone remotely interested in the subject."
2,Overrated Pop Music,"After reading all the hype about this album over the years, I decided to finally listen to it, because my favorite music period is the late 60's - early 70's. In my opinion, it's much ado about nothing. I got tired of the irritating Beach Boy harmonies and over-production very quickly. Most of the songs are nothing special. They aren't in the same league as Traffic, Queen, Yes or Led Zeppelin. Most of the lyrics are trite and pretentious - and the singer really isn't very distinctive. The song writing is far from spectacular. I've always liked, ""Tell Her No"", and ""She's Not There"", but I heard nothing on this CD that matched the quality of those two songs. WHAT am I missing!!!!?!?! I'm convinced that the reason why this album has a cult following is because the hooks in some of the songs stay with you like ear worms and drive you crazy! I listened to it twice and will recycle it at my local used CD store."
5,A gem,"This essential-to-own recording captures every one of the players at the top of their form. Powell and Stitt at their very best, wonderfully complementing each other. Speed, articulation, creativity, soul, tight group, bebop at its very best. Don't even ask, just own it."
3,Too long in space,"Stephen Baxter brings surprising, depressing, and frightening ideas about how we got here, why we don't think we've found anyone else in the universe, and what's in store for us when we do. Or it's a political and environmental commentary about what bad things countries are doing to each other while we're all doing it to the only planet we've got. How science will not save us, and in fact that there's no saving us at all. Just one big universal slog, from (cosmic) dust to dust. Yes, main characters, heroes, and adventures do keep you turning the pages to the next event. But there's no real story here, and the points have been made long before their repetition extends Space as much too long a book. Meanwhile, it's fair that Baxter brings religion and G-d into the equation, because that's our answer to the big questions. But again, the point can be made in a much shorter treatise -- try Ecclesiastes."
1,truly bad,"I don't understand the glowing reviews of other readers. bad characterizations, stupid names, no discernable plot and depressing. oh, and once in a while a clever idea. after 200 pages I couldn't take it any more and threw it out. read Benford or Brin or Vinge if you want to see what *good* sci-fi written by a physicist is like."
2,Fun ghosts but shaky history,"Wish I could agree with the previous reviewer, but, as someone who knows a fair amount about the Island's history, I feel compelled to say that a lot of the ""history"" in this book is not accurate! Ghost stories abound on the Island and it's fun that they've been documented. But don't count on all the history being accurate!"
3,Window screen kit,The plastic corners break easily during assembly. The product is more expensive than the parts you can buy at Home Depot.
5,this takes a couple of listens,"I don't know what everyone is going on about this is a very good album, the guitar playing is top notch and the tunes are excellent. They (he) can't simply keep on putting out Siamese Dream rehashed."
3,Get Silversun Pickups instead,"No, really. If you are a fan of Gish or Siamese Dream, this album doesn't come close to those masterworks. This is more Billy Tries To Be Black Sabbath. Sure, he can rock out. But none of these songs equal anything from the first two albums. If you want to hear something that sounds like that, you might want to check out Silversun Pickups' ""Carnavas,"" which features lots of histrionic guitars and a singer who ranges from wispy to roaring, just like Billy used to -- before he became All Nasal All The Time. Seriously, listen to the Pickups' ""Lazy Eye"" which is a helluva tribute to the way SP used to be (the sample on Amazon doesn't do it justice).Anyway, nice try Billy, but you still are hitting foul balls. Other folks are making better Pumpkins albums than you are these days. Any particular reason that Silversun Pickups and Smashing Pumpkins share initials???"
2,I second the Poi Dog Pondering recommendation,"Going with Duane, I have to say skip this one and check out the Poi Dog Pondering ""7"" cd...fellow Chicago band that made a comeback, but possibly released the best CD of their career.7"
3,not even about the music,I'd rather have the original lineup back...more than I'd rather have a pretty good smashing pumpkins album
3,There are too many critic wannabees out there....,"First off, I'm not a wannabee music critic. What I am is a Pumpkin fan whom was mildly curious about the new cd. Here's my two cents. It's a good album. I would place it better than the Machina series, but not better than anything done prior to that. There are some ""Pumpkin-esque"" sounds, but it is new and that's not a bad thing. They can't keep doing the same music over and over - people would get sick of it. Anyway, the good is pretty darn good, just as the bad really sucks. Over all, I like the disk, but will probably call it quits on them after this."
2,Disappointing album,"I admit it, I fell for the hype. I loved Smashing Pumpkins in the early to mid 90's but didn't really follow them after Mellon Collie. They were an essential part of my late teenage years and Siamese Dream is my favorite album of there's. So in comparison with those works, no this doesn't even come close. As has already been mentioned, the songwriting and riffs are just nothing to write home about, and the vocals are oftentimes like nails on a chalkboard. Something about the way they were mixed is just irritating, and doesn't sit well in the overall mix. Yes they have proved they can still rock, and it's still better then a lot of the garbage out today, but knowing what the Pumpkins are capable of just puts this album way behind many of their works."
1,Once a big SP fan,"I didn't expect much from once great and famous group which I have been a ""die for"" fan of, I bought it for my girlfriend as she tought she still loved them. Not true anymore.he used to be a little boySo old in his shoesAnd what he had chosen was his voiceWhat's a boy supposed to doThe killer in him was the killer in..."
1,Awful - Corgan is washed up.,"A few months ago I listened to all of the previous SP albums. I was more amazed at how incredible most everything sounded. Great songs. The wheels began to come off on Machina:TMOG. With this, I wasn't expecting much. Unfortunately this is the worst ""Smashing Pumpkins"" (it ain't real without D'Arcy + Iha) album of them all. I cannot believe how bad it is. Not one good song. If I were the label exec who received this finished product, I would have said sorry Billy, I'm not releasing it. I've already banished it from my memory (not difficult to do with this dull set), and will remember the good times by listening to Gish, or Siamese Dream. This album may have warranted a second star if Corgan had the decency to release this as a solo album or any other iteration of his choosing, but to put this out as a bona fide SP album only serves to damage the legacy of the name. Shame on Billy Corgan. This album is garbage."
5,You can depend on Billy,"For 7 years, 7 months, and 7 days (well it turned out to be 10) he took his chances yeah... but now he can make a big come back 'cause he's good like that."
2,NOT FOR OLD SCHOOL SMASHING PUMPKIN FANS,"Most bands that stand the test of time have to grow or at least change, or every album would sound the same. I understand this & accept that the pumpkins of Gish thru Mellon Collie era no longer exist. I haven't liked much since that era. I just can't ""get"" their newer albums. Hardcore PUMPKINS fans my disagree, but this album is flat, boring, and quite simply has no punch. Classic SP almbums could hit as hard as any act in rock or slow it down, but with heavy emotion. Maybe its the fact that this album is really only 1/2 of the orig. pumpkins... either way I would discourage fans of Gish, Lull, & S. Dream from buying this album."
5,Forget the bias,"I really wish people would (inevitably) stop comparing it to their older material.. in my opinion it was a different era of (far, far better) music, which i'm not sure the Pumpkins would fit into if they released it now. Zeitgeist is, to me, an amazing and diverse album, and while it doesn't give the same 'feel' as previous albums, if you give it a chance without throwing it off as a sub-par CD and let it grow, it will be one of your favorite albums for a while to come in a time of fairly tragic music everywhere else.People forget your bias to the 'older' Pumpkins and pick up a copy, you won't regret it."
2,Billy Corgan's Final Cut....,"This is hardly a SP record...it really an example of Billy Corgan learning marketing. His previous projects, Zwan and his solo alubm (both of which featured Jimmy Chamberlain at some point) failed commericially and alienated his fans.....this is really the equal of Pink Floyd's FINAL CUT (which really was a Waters solo venture)...it just that floyd didn't rip fans off by pushing 7 (yes seven) different ""versions"" of the album.Overall, BC doesn't know if he wants to be heavy, political or loving...it just doesn't mesh well as a whole. With one or two good tracks (the best is the 10 minute epic UNITED STATES which sounds very Machina-era like), this doesn't have much to offer....nostalgia is nice...but this kills the love."
3,Better than what's out there...,"But unfortunately that's not saying a lot. Comparing it to other SP works this one hovers near the bottom, just ahead of Machina. Yes, I had high expectations. No, they were not met. The album was over-produced, with pointless dubbed harmonies added throughout. They really become irritating after a while. Most of the rhythm guitar parts were predictable, repetitive, and unimaginative by SP standards. Perhaps with less production, the raw guitars and Billy's voice would have added some energy to this average/mediocre album alas this is not the case. Still my favorite band of all time. It's just unfortunate that they couldn't come back on a better note."
3,not really an SP disc,"only 50% of the members, and a decent album but not on par with previous SP releases. Still better than Billy's solo album."
2,"The doomsday clock has struck, Billy","I feel like there's something meaningful in the second verse of ""Tarantula""--""We are the real/If real ever was/And just because/We are the real/They feel we have enough/We are the real/'Cause someone gave us up""--but I'm not sure what it is. They aren't the real, you know; only Billy Corgan and drummer Jimmy Chamberlain came back. You can't make the Smashing Pumpkins with those two, but you CAN make a new album and label it a Smashing Pumpkins record, or so they figured. The result is a jungle of mordacious guitar work and acrid growling (whining?) from Corgan, the swollen Fu Manchu behind this whole evil plot. For Pumpkin diehards, it'll be enough. But there used to be something to their music, something it conveyed that clung parasitically to the indie environment of the early- to mid-Nineties. In this fallow wasteland of an album, there's only noise."
2,"Call me an old man, but.....",I didn't like this album at all. I was really looking forward to it because I loved Billy and Smashing Pumpkins growing up and through college but this album never grew on me. Maybe I'm just getting old and I'm not as into something this heavy. The album was much heavier than I thought it would be. I always liked the Pumpkins' mellow songs the most and this certainly didn't have much of that.Matt Zarnstorff
3,Welcome Back Billy,"Better than the last Pumpkins release, before the break up. Still lacking the fire of ""Melloncollie"" or ""Siamese Dream"", but interesting none the less."
2,Boring,"I'm not a huge Smashing Pumpkins fan or anything but I did really like their first 4 albums. Once they did Adore that's when they turned for the worst. After the break up Zwan was pathetic and lifeless. that band was never ment to go anywhere. In 07 Billy decides to get a new Pumpkins band together with founding member Jimmy Chamberlin and two new people. The result is a sloppy, weak mess. This album only has a 2 good songs. Doomsday Clock and Bring The Light. Other then that the album is just straight up garbage. Every other song sounds flat and stale. I'm all about a band experimenting and trying new directions but this album really has no life to it. If I want to listen to the Pumpkins it's going to be 1 of the first 4 albums."
2,Smashing Pumpkins Stale,"I have waited a long time to post this because I wanted to get over the original excitement of the Smashing Pumpkins getting back together and touring the world with their Rock n Roll anthem rock.Sadly, since summer has passed, I have not loaded this disc. It is tired and just the sight of the jewel case makes me want to listen to something else.I am not sure specifically what it is about this album that doesn't register with me, but there is no feeling that comes from it. The other albums, you could really sense something in the abrasiveness of the music and Corgan's lyrics were equally as biting, but not here. Instead what I found was another attempt at bringing back the dead, which is a mistake that too many artists make.This album isn't bad enough for me to tell them to not make another record, but it is far from impressive and to be honest, at this stage of the game, I expect a lot more."
2,Don't feel betrayed...,"it's only a name anyhow. Just decide whether or not you dig Billy's new territory then proffer or withhold your money. After listening to the full album on a pretty terrific preview site, I promptly chose to save my money and spent a gleeful afternoon in the kitchen preparing food for company while turning out some of my favorite SP moments of yore. We're certainly all entitled to change (after all, every seven years our body has undergone a complete cellular, and perhaps even mental remodeling) so it's perfectly natural for an artist to come to a point within their process where their work is no longer relatable to the majority of their once central audience. So, for Billy and 'crew', the beauty and grandeur you've already birthed into this universe is, and always will be, your greatest comeback."
2,Disappointing,"It's hard to believe Corgan's song writing has gotten so bad. I kept listening through the album, waiting to find a great song. Tarantula is OK but it's one of the best songs on this mediocre album. All this album reveals is Billy is a narcissist, who doesn't realize he's lost his songwriting talents."
2,Another Crappy Comeback Album,I listened to the whole album and I only remember Tarantula because its played on the radio so many times. No memorable riffs or choruses. It all just kind of bleeds together into blah. Pretty much what I expected though. Almost all comeback albums suck. Add this one to the list.
4,Simply Smashing,"I am more a fan of later Corgan than earlier Corgan. I was more a fan of Zwan, than earlier SP (bust still liked some older SP), I liked Corgan's solo work and I am really liking SP.I have been listening to the CD off and on for over a month now and it really has grown on me. I don't like first impressions of CDs at all. Although my first impression of this CD wasn't bad, it still took me a while to appreciate it. I love Corgan's lyrics and his more positive deep views of life. It isn't so much young angst, but a more mature view of life. However, Corgan seems a bit rusty and I think the band still is trying to gel, but other than that a great CD."
4,Zeitgeist,Good CD but a little slow towards the end. They've still got it! I saw them preform at Pinkpop music festival in Holland and they were great!
3,OK. Sounds rushed.,"This CD could have been much better (i believe). It is pretty raw and heavy, but lacks hooks that stick and some melodic moments.I like it, but dont see myself playing it a lot. Siamease Dream 2 it is NOT! But it is a decent rock CD. Just not what you would expect after such a long hiatus. The songs just dont sound finished."
4,SOLID RETURN,"Ok lets face it, most ""come backs"" are boring, nothing new and defiantly nothing better. Zeitgeist is nothing new, defiantly nothing better but is in no way boring. Billy's vocals have lost nothing. Instrumentally the album holds up. Lyrics are highly political and hold attention. The album rocks the first listen and only gets better. Overall Zeitgeist is a worthy addition to the SP catalogue. In a weird way it kind of sounds fresh, probably because its been so long since SP have released material. Anyway,buy it, SP maybe classified as golden oldies music these days but this album still sounds better than most contempary releases. Welcome back looking forward to the world tour."
1,smashing pumpkins?,"doesnt sound like smashing pumpkins to me. as a long time fan, for me, this is an incredibly disappointing album."
2,Uninspired,"I only like four songs on this album, Doomsday Clock, Tarantula, United States and Bring The Light. More the first two than the second two. Sure, this album sounds like the old Smashing Pumpkins, but that's not good enough. Uninspired."
3,Is this Zwan?,"Seriously, this is not the Smashing Pumpkins...I was so excited when it was announced that they were reuniting. I went out Tuesday morning and purchased this disc at Best Buy for around $15...what a waste. There are possibly two, maybe three good songs on this disc, otherwise this is a bad cd. I hope for some actual ""Pumpkins"" music on their next disc."
4,Good album,"I enjoyed this album, focuses more on edgy guitar sounds than what the band is most-known for. I do think this is worth the buy, but considering the wait, think they could've done better."
3,"SP, the new SD of the 21st century.","During my first perusal through Zeitgeist, this thought came to mind, ""Which album is this? Hasn't this been done before?"" The sound is like 7 years never passed, classic wall of guitars and great drumming on Chamberlin's part. For hardcore fans, this album is sure to please, it reaches back and uses all the SP cliche' riffs and sound. Not that this is bad, but you'd think there would be a little growth in the sound that was hinted at in Machina'. Billy is still the wordsmith he has always been - progressing to more contemporary issues. Now that the band is down to two with a couple of hired guns brought in to fill in, it reminds me of another duo of the past -Steely Dan. Their comeback album after 20 years or so was their classic sound as if time stood still for them, just like this album."
5,The Smashing Pumpkins are back!!!!,I can't quit listening to this cd. I love every song on this cd. My favorite tracks are 1-7. They have certainly have grown musically. I am glad that they are back and rocking my world again. I give this cd two thumbs up. Pumpkin fans will not be not be disappointed. Go buy it!!!!
1,this special edition is not special at all.really dissapointed,"ive been expectin this special edition really more special than the standard one.but the thing is this edition sucks.i got a scrached cd after the 1st time i opened the sealed package cos the cd is put in the back slipcase and way a lot worse than it to put in a standard cd case for more protection.and the 76 pages *full*colored book is bulls***!it only got 4or5 low quality picture prints and a *lot*blank pages and transparent pages(so they call a transparent page is TWO PAGES)that is ridiculous cos all the so called book contained 4-5 pictures that maybe billy took and one billy transparent page and one jimmy page the rest are lyrics just like the standard edition.so everybody who got a brain don't buy this LTD VERSION,ITS A TOTAL WASTED OF MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!though the music is good.everybody should listen to the music n don't expect anything more of this album"
1,Don't bother,"Zeitgeist is a major disappointment. It is very immature and sloppy, which is strange coming from such a perfectionist. Billy's vocals are dreadful, so much for the singing lessons! As for the music being reminiscent of the ""old pumpkins"" like I had read, well it just isn't true.If you want good Pumpkins, look at Siamese Dream, Mellon Collie and Machina."
2,Disappointingly Average at Best,"First of all, to have this billed as a 'Smashing Pumpkins' album is extremely misleading. The only two original members is Billy Corgan and the (ironically enough) once-exiled drummer Jimmie Chamberlin. Completely missing is James Iha and D'Arcy. So right off the bat, this was an album that, in my mind, was behind the eight-ball to start with. You're missing half the band and the one-guy you did get to come back was someone you gave the boot to in the first place.One or two decent tracks just isn't enough to justify a glorified Billy Corgan solo album. If you need a good Pumpkins fix, go to their earlier work up to around 'Mellon Collie' ..."
2,Da Queen is Back!,"OMG I love Madonna. She has never sounded better on a CD. This is like, the best one.Madonnas the kind of girl who you'd meet in a record store, and you'd ask for her phone number, and then she'd act all Madonna-ish and blow you off, and you leave the record store loving her more than ever. I mean, haven't we all met someone like that?Meanwhile, Madonna's new album totally, like, rocks. I mean, her biggest hits are here, and the cover of the album is nice. Im thinking if she didn't hook up with Britney Spears, she would have at least made a couple of good rock albums like this one. Who knew she had it in her?I think Madonna's dad would be proud that she finally abandoned her pathetic attempts to be a dancer and made some really sweet dance music like this one.Amazing! Isn't life crazy?!"
3,Pomp and Circumstances,"Billy is truly at his best in songs like ""Pomp and Circumstances"" the only song I purchased on the album. I wouldn't mind if he dropped the SP title and went back to producing another solo album."
2,major disappointment,"I was in the process of upgrading my shop and wanted a jointer with longer beds than my 8"" Grizzly. After reading the review (the only one at your site) I was sold. I received my jointer Dec. 29,2005 and couldn't wait to get it set up, which I could never do. Powermatic actually authorized a local dealer to come to my shop and adjust it for me. After 3 hours and lots of frustration, we found that the outfeed table had a .006 bow, and the infeed table had an .008 bow, which the technician said was unacceptable and that was causing my problems. After they contacted Powermatic, they said that those tolerances are acceptable, and they would not do anything about it. Now I have a jointer that does not produce good glue joints. Also the fence had a bow in it. I am very disappointed and am looking into returning the Powermatic and returning to my Grizzly."
2,Too Cheaply Made,My kids love their rocket launcher but the blue fins come off way too easy and make the rocket useless.
3,"More Missiles, More Fun!",The toy itself with the launcher is an excellent toy. Original package comes with 4. This is a refill and a little steep for the price.
4,Blanket was a hit,"I purchased this blanket for my niece for her birthday. She loved it, and still comments about how it is always on her bed at night, or wrapped around her when she is on the couch watching TV or at the computer."
5,Much better deal than the 5400.,"This model addresses some of the short-comings of the 5400. It is, for just a little more money, already network/broadband-ready (it has a built-in network interface card). It also adds double the RAM, double the hard drive space and a little bit better CPU (processor speed), though this is still a Celeron-based computer and as such will not be great with complex graphics tasks (eg. gaming and CAD). In any case, for the price, this is more than adequate for most users and is clearly a great buy."
1,Elementary informatiom,"I purchased this book based on the author's notes. Upon receipt, I was very disappointed. For the most part, the information provided can be gotten from free publications available from any commodities exchange for the asking. The text is double spaced and chapters are one or two pages long. Considering the asking price, this is not a good investment."
1,Not Worth The Paper It's Printed On,One of the thinnest publications I've ever seen. Completely useless. You could get more information from a brief web search or from the CME and CBOT. Pathetic.
1,Is This a Joke?,"I ordered & downloaded the Adobe version ofFutures For Small Speculators by Noble Drakoln.Is this a joke?It is not worth $1.Many free sites would say the same thing & offer the same info---for FREE.It was like a long pamphlet(about 25 BLANK pages, & 25 written & 1/2 written pages."
1,Junk,I would recommend Teweles & Jones or Schwager instead of this junk. This author is more of a self-promoter than anything.
5,You MUST Read This Book...,"...if you read First Evidence. Not only does Outer Perimeter continue the characters, I think it was a better book overall!!! The writing style is perfected in Outer Perimeter and flow is incredibly strong.The book nearly made me call in to work sick in order to keep reading. (grin) Ken Goddard is one of my favorite authors and I strongly recommend starting with First Evidence and then continuing with Outer Perimeter.The way the book ends yields 5 stars in itself! Most books I read tend to fizzle near the end, or have a predictable ending. Outer Perimeter keeps you reading until the last page. Once you finish, you will wish there was more!!!Also, Balefire is an excellent book, especially considering the fact that it was written over 20 years ago and reads like it was recently written.Take my word for it, this guy is incredible!!!"
4,One hundred Hungry,"One Hundred Hungry AntsOne hundred hungry ants marching in a row, going to a picnic-but were they too slow? I enjoyed this book as much as the kids I read it to did. Reading its bubbly rhymed verses made it a fun book to read. One Hundred Hungry Ants gives young readers a great visual for math. This book can be used in many ways for counting, multiplication, division and money. Were they too slow? You'll have to read to know."
5,100 Hungry Ants,"I read this book to my son who is almost six years old. He loves bugs, so this book instantly got his attention! He enjoyed how the words rhymed and how the ants say, ""A hey and a hi dee ho!"". Of course he didn't get the concept of division, but we counted how the ants went from one row, to two rows, to fours rows, and so on. This book was a lot of fun to read and was really enjoyed by my son. It would be great for those a little older who are learning division."
4,Nice simple math for 1st/2nd grade.,"A nice simple story and simple math (division) about some ants. Pleasant, unoffensive and nicely illustrated. Likely a keeper 'til the kids outgrow it."
1,WET BOOK,"The book was wet. I was prepared for the book to be used, but was disappointed that it was WET."
1,Maybe for business execs but NOT FOR YOUNG CHILDREN,"Hated it! The ugly illustrations lack color, and lack soft rounded objects that are usually found in children's picture books. Also, the ""chaos"" pages did not effectively convey the ants realigning themselves. The story line too is awful because ants have the natural trait of traveling in single file lines -- they only do otherwise when scattered by outside forces. The worst thing about this book is that is has an unhappy ending, the hungry ants never get to eat; children expect and want a happy ending."
4,math can be fun,"I am a current Pima College student. The book was read to a class of second graders. They seemed very receptive of the fact that it rhymed(in fact they loved it). I asked one student named caitlyn, if she understood the math concept it taught. She said she did not realize math was involved. So although the concept is somewhat suttle to children I think this book would be a great introduction to division. So i would recomend this book to anyone with kids or to teachers."
5,Great 100-Day resource for 1st Grade,"I read this book to my first-grade class on our 100th day of school, along with other books and activities. This book's rhythm engaged the listeners. They quickly picked up on it and were able to recite the end phrase of every page in unison. It is now a book that is checked out everyday by someone from our classroom library."
2,loved the art but not the ending...,I really wanted to like this book and it had me up until the last couple of pages.The art is great & I like the tempo of the story as the ants divide into shorter & shorter rows in order to make better time but the ending is a total let down!The story leaves you with the impression that math is useless and is a waste of time. The ants reap no reward for doing the smart thing and are even mad at the little ant that suggested dividing up. The ending implies that they would have made it to the picnic in time if only they hadn't wasted all that time dividing into shorter rows - ultimately not a positive math message at all.I like a good quirky kids story where thing don't end the way you might expect & not everyone is nice but this one falls short of quirky & just ends on a bad note.
4,Elisa- Elementary Ed. Student at U of A and Pima,"I read this book to my two cousins, one who was age eight and the other six. The older one did not like the story very much, she thought she was alittle too old to be listening to a book about ants going to a picnic.However the younger one enjoyed the book, even though she did not understand the division. She enjoyed the way the book flowed, the pictures, the story and most of all the ""hey and a hi dee hos"". I think for younger readers this book is really fun and instructional."
3,Stil Fogs up,"I bought these because I am a bicycle commuter in the cold early am, before the sun comes up. I needed a clear set of glasses, and had read that these are vented so they do not fog up. Though they are not as bad as regular glasses, they do in fact fog up at stop lights when you have been sitting for a bit. They quickly defog as soon as you get rolling again, but it is important to note that they do in fact get foggy. Other than that, I really like them."
5,Great eyewear,"Bright clear lenses, resistant to scratches. I use these everyday at the range. They are a very comfortable fit under my earmuffs."
5,Did the trick!,"Used for shooting range with family for a day of outdoor fun, bought multiple pairs, worked perfectly. Not an expert but my wife thought they were fashionable as well as practical."
3,Okay glasses - clear lens,I have to agree with the other reviewer who has the clear lens model. They are comfortable but objects are not as sharp as you would think. Overall they seem okay....
4,Good sun glasses that double as eye safety protection.,"Bought them for Eye Protection for Target Practice, they are so nice now the wife wears them on sunny days. The gray glasses don't change the colors of objects and it provides what appears to be good protection against UV rays.Good quality and appear to be holding really well."
5,great product / great deal,great price point and great fit. seem to be good quality so I am happy with the purchase so far.
3,You get what you pay for,"I bought these for the price and let me be clear, they are serviceable safety glasses.The Good:- Cheap- Light weight- ComfortableThe Bad:- Not Sturdy- Do not ""form"" well to my face and are a bit small, which allows things like saw dust to fly in. While you want to use goggles when you are cutting, its nice to have safety glasses that fit/are big enough that you can make a quick cut without a problem.I do not think I would buy these again."
5,If only all farms could look like this one!,"A wonderful introduction to farm life is this beautifully illustrated children's book. With rhyming prose and full-page illustrations, ""Red Are the Apples"" is a delight for rural dwellers and city folk alike.Each page takes the young reader through different crops and other elements of a thriving farm. The fun lies also in finding the hen that appears on almost every page. That becomes a ""search"" that the child will delight in taking.This is a five-star book that I had the pleasure of sharing with my four-year-old niece."
2,If you want a wedding just like the author's daughter had...,"this is the book for you. Basically, this book is written for the young bride who is leaving her parents' home for the first time. After a ceremony at their place of worship, her parents host a reception at their home. Nothing wrong with that kind of wedding, but if you intend any deviation from this plan, you'll get lots more information from a more up-to-date book. The original of this book was written in 1961, and it doesn't seem to have changed significantly since then."
4,All the Basics,"I received this book as a gift for planning my wedding and used it religiously to make sure I did not forget any details. ""Checklist"" takes you through all the basics...etiquette, timeline, suggestions etc. The premise is, if you use the list and check off all you've finished and all that doesn't apply to you, you will have considered all the elements of a wedding. In the end, your careful planning and use of the checklist will reward you with a beautiful day that you will remember forever, and guests who are pleased that you anticipated their every need. (The book doesn't include decorating ideas, etc., so I purchased Martha Stewart Weddings MAGAZINE and used online resources.)"
5,A Perfect Planner for a Perfect Wedding!,"This is just what you need to organize your thoughts, work out the details, and prepare for an absolely elegant wedding. I had very little time to spare, and this helped me figure out what I needed to do, by when, and for what. I can't wait to read the REVISED Version! It will be even better."
5,Five Stars,"This is a great additon to the ""Mother of"" series. The no nonsense advice is written in a breezy style that busy parents will fine easy to absorb. Some of the funny ""front line"" stories will have you laughing and nodding in recognition of your own life. It's a great read!by: Debbie Farmer, parenting auhtor of 'Don't Put Lipstick on the Cat!'"
2,not super,"I had liked The Mother of All Pregnancy Books and decided to try this one. But I don't find it nearly as complete or helpful as ""What to Expect the Toddler Years"". I haven't read it cover to cover, but so far I find that the sections don't delve deeply enough into topics or offer unique suggestions/advice."
5,Sermons on Faith,"15 sermons on faith from the former pastor of 1st Presbyterian Church in Greensboro, NC. These will still ""preach""!"
5,VERY INFORMATIVE....,i recently got this book and i was amazed how the author captured some of the great natural wonders of the country....its a very informative book and glad it was updated...underwater shots was a big plus in telling how rich the flora and fauna of the country is.
4,Great collection of Sim Games!,"I stumbled across this set quite by accident, and being the Sim addict I am, I just HAD to buy it! I already had half of the games, but the price was worth it just for the others. The one thing I'm not crazy about is the lack of printed manuals, but for these prices, you can't have everything. There is full documentation on the CDs themselves, so if you have a printer, it's easy enough to create your own reference manuals. If you'd like a more than reasonably priced introduction to Sim Games, this set is a must have :D"
4,I am a tester for Maxis and EA,I gave these games 4 stars becouse they are fun for the whole family with sim copter for the kids and sim tower for the adults this game is great vaulue 1 year ago you would have to buy all these games seperate and each one costing the same price so buy buy buy !!! PoPkOrN
1,Booorrrring!,"Aside from some short-lived fun with SimSafari, which would be great for kids, by the way, the rest is pointless. SimIsle is unplayable. I did not enjoy this pack at all and feel like I wasted good money that I could've spent on one single better, more challenging game."
1,Great Games but are incompatible with Windows 7,"I got this when I was younger and had loved the Sim Tower, Sim Copter, and Sim Safari as all time favorite games. But one thing I didn't realize about these games is that they are not compatible with Windows 7. Looking at blogs online it seems that Microsoft refuses to make any changes to allow them to be compatible because there aren't enough people for it to apply to."
3,one game-worth it all,"I liked some of the games but SimTower was worth all my money.1)SimCity-Terrible graphics, the tax thing gets really annoying, and you don't really have enough money-2/52)SimTower-This game is addicting. You get to build your own tower and the more population and stuff you get the higher your stars will be. If you get a cathedral you win it all. (I am at Star 3) This is my favorite game.-5/53)SimIsle-I have no clue how to play this. 0/54)SimSafari-This game is really fun the first time but then you get bored. 3/55)Streets of SimCity-Your average ""have fun blowing yourself up"" kind of game. 2.5/56)SimCopter-The 3-D is really annoying and I can't seem to save anything of solve anything except for traffic but it is fun to through Sims out of the copter-2/5"
2,SUCCERS!,"The only good game in this is Sim Safari! The other games didn't work on my DELL Laptop, or I couldn't get the whole point. And even Sim Safari can sometimes get too challenging, for it's so hard to eliminate locusts, fires, and drought. Even playing this game at its least challenging is quite difficult. Unlike in Zoo Tycoon, everybody wants to see buffalo, elephants, leopards, lions, and rhinos. In the scenarios, you start with too little money, so as soon as you spend over half your budget on an amphitheatre your in trouble! No, just get the civ, galactic civ, alpha centauri, and tycoon series."
1,This just proves time marches over the older classics,"I bought this collection directly from the EA online store. Whle all of these might have been really great when they came out (although I know that even then many of them were judged overwhelmingly not to be), time and our resulting expectations, as game upgrading marches on, have ground these into the dust of gaming history. Where they might have been fun once, now they are tedious and disappointing. The exception, of course, is SimCity, which makes it through the limitations of its obviously archaic, extremely simplistic graphics with, nevertheless, still entertaining game-play.However, overall, we must accept that some things we loved in the past aren't capable of matching our current game-play expectations. These Sim classics are some of those, and are best left back there in the past to be remembered fondly... unless you just want some antiques you'll never use around to give your PC software library ""substance""."
3,This may not be what you think...,"This is not the version that I loved back in the seventies. It doesn't have the ""Interview"" or the story about the ""bevy of nude young native ladies"" and how he sat on their clothes... so they wouldn't be stolen. Its as if someone removed some of the finest and most funny parts of the original LP and replaced it with something more politically correct. I feel rather [like soemthing's missing]. You may feel the same way if you ever heard the original selections. Too bad..."
4,Beautiful blind but does not provide total privacy,The shade is gorgeous and is very easy to install. I put it on my bathroom window but later learned that at night when the light is on anyone on the outside can see in. If you don't need the total privacy or have other curtains you can pull over the blind then it's a great blind for a great price.
3,Pho Balo - Na-Palm (3.5),"I was pleasantly surprised by this album. I bought it from a random person in the parking lot of Best Buy, so I had no idea what to expect. He mentioned it was from the bay area, and I've always been a fan of that style of music so I figured I'd give it a shot. The delivery/flow of the emcees is decent, but the production is what really did it for me. Classic bay area production throughout the album. My favorite tracks are ""Gotta Deal Wit It,"" ""House Party"" and ""Don't Wanna Hurt U."" Pick this up if you're into the bay area rap scene, you won't be disappointed."
3,BALLAD OF A PEACEFUL MAN,"Quintessential prog rock from the veritable Vertigo Spiral label. It is surprising that this band achieved such little success when lesser stable-mate luminaries such as Uriah heep and Juicy Lucy forged successful careers. My mint condition original now changes hands at 175. The band's neo-classical pretensions were typical of other groups on Vertigo such as Gracious, Beggar's opera and Cressida, all of whom are worth checking out."
4,Good!,"It's a good talk to listen to. I'd recommend it for people in business, as you need to know How to work with people."
5,muy bueno,"Un libro diferente ,sin perder la esencia que caracteriza al autor y donde como siempre en cada uno de sus libros nos podemos ver reflejados ,la union con silvia salinas me parece genial ."
2,Writing is too casual,"I've used the OOpic some and It's a great MCU. I have some reservations about the writing in this book however. The author constantly makes references that aren't explained, remarks on illustrations but doesn't make it clear on the photo what is being referred too, and generally talks about each subject, but doesn't necessarily always make a clear point.It's a handy book for the reference, but all that material is free online, so the price of the book weighs heavily on the balance of the material which in this reader's mind, is vague in areas that need specifics, and specific in areas that are free to the public anyway.I look forward to the second version though just the same. I feel guilty attacking the style of a clearly experienced engineer, but engineers in general know that they are a breed apart. The rest of us Laymen need more help. And if the second version enlists the eyes of a Layman, It will expose those areas that are ""muddy"" and make it a better book."
5,"Carnivale - creative, magical, haunting, beautiful...","Every aspect of Carnivale was sheer genius down to the minutest detail. The writing was fascinating and haunting and the actors were all brilliant. It never felt like watching ""acting"", it felt like watching truth. Each actor created a character with pasts, futures, fears, lost opportunities, aspirations, etc. that all came out in their performances. Michael J. Anderson's performance, in particular, was poignant and unforgettable. I wish HBO would bring the show back, preferably for four more seasons to give Daniel Knauf the chance to bring his story to completion, but at least for one movie - with the same actors - to try to bring some sort of conclusion to the story. Failing that, I wish Daniel Knauf would write a book taking over where Season 2 ended. But, since Seasons 1 and 2 are all we have, I highly recommend them to everyone who appreciates outstanding creativity."
5,Drives me CRAZY,".... that this HBO show has not gotten the recognition it deserves.I have loved the Sopranos and Six Feet Under ...And it took about 3 episodes for me to really get into it... but once I did... WHOA was it worth it.This show, more than any other, has haunted me. I've been aching for it to come back. It is so well written, produced, acted, directed, shot...It is truely a fantastic show.And there are so many ""secrets"" and Clues to be discovered in this show. I can hardly wait to get the DVD so I can go through it all with a fine tooth comb.Might I add that if you liked the book ""The Divinci Code"", you should like this. There are certainly elements of the Divinci Code in this show."
3,We Live By A Code...,"Amazing show, but PAINFULLY slow. It took about two episodes to get me hooked, but once it did, Carnivale delivered. The characters and their actions keep the viewer interested even when the ""main story"" isn't moving along. No matter how slow, each episode seems to have a ""pay-off"" style ending with a surprise or twist in store for the dedicated viewer. I wish I could give this series more than three stars, but, to be honest, this series is only going to truly intrigue a hardcore fan of the genre."
3,potential,"The start of the series had potential. It was dark and you felt like it was going to keep you wanting to watch more and hoping for an awsome conclusion. However, It never happens! 1 of HBO's early series so it was probably testing the boundries. Not as raw as series coming out now."
5,Carnivale,This was a gift for my husband and he has not stopped watching it. He found a used copy of the second season that he was happy to have so this was a great gift. I will say that the price was excellent. He paid a couple dollars more for the used copy!
2,DVD scratched,"We like the show well enough, but one of the DVDs was scratched. That made it incredibly annoying because the DVD would just stop and we missed a bunch of the episode. The reason we BOUGHT the DVDs is because we can't find it at video stores or the library. I'm *hoping* the rest of the DVDs are in good shape."
3,Creepy,We've now watched 3 episodes and we're starting to wonder if there's an actual plot.It seems like the show just wanders from scene to scene with little to tie it all together.
5,The Big Payoff,"This is the best produced, acted, and written show that I have ever seen on TV. I feel embarrased to speak in such superlatives. The whole look of the the series is mesmeris1ng and feels authentic. At the end of the season, I felt frustrated with so many questions left hanging. And now the second season is being shown and does it ever deliver! And I'm beggining to see parallels between Brother Justin's manipulation of the votes of his poverty sticken followers and some things that are happening in today's political arena. And who got these actors together on the same show? Wow. My personal character favorites is the ""cooch"" show family, where old dad pimps his wife and daughter out on the side. Which brings me to the most outstanding and original concept of the show. Yes, there are distinctive forces of good and evil, dark and light, but there is a large ground of moral ambiguity in between that we have to navigate on our own."
2,Disapointed -terrible quality DVD,"Love the show. Bought this for my husband for his birthday. What a terrible disappointment that the 3 DVD is nearly unwatchable. Didn't realize until just now that the seller was not actually Amazon, since it 'shipped from Amazon'."
3,Based on the series not on DVD content,"Seaon 1 was good and I did not have high hopes for season two because stories would drag on with very little drama. But I watched season two to give it a chance because I thought the premise of a traveling dust bowl 'era' carnivale was good. Season Two was incredible. The stories were rich and exciting, Watching season two made season one better. It is important to know the story from the beginning and you get so much from season one in season two. Buy one when you can also buy season two."
1,"Interesting, but slow","Great cinematography, an interesting premise, and interesting characters that are well-cast are the strenghts of Carnivale. That said, it is simply too slow. Mysterious events happen that have seem to have no connection to the overall plot, which is itself a mystery. Character development is laborious; by the time something meaningful happens it is hard to understand the connection to the events that were spread out over the course of several episodes. No wonder HBO chose not to renew it; it was like trying to understand War and Peace reading a chapter each week, then putting the book down after 100 pages and begin reading again after several months. I wish I could give it a better review; I really liked the idea and vision. But it just didn't work for me."
1,We're Done,"Well, we rented 5 episodes which, in my humble opinion, is more than a fair chance but, the series never seemed to have any direction so we won't be renting any more of them. Thumbs Down!"
2,Smut peddler,"I thought I would like this but after watching a lot of goop, gore, sex and violence in almost slow motion I was left with a bad taste in my mouth. Are most human beings this nasty?"
2,Frustrating and Infuriatingly slow,"I have to give kudos for fun, rich characters but that's about it. I'm not surprised to find there was only two seasons. We're receiving the first season via an online video rental and while the first 2 episodes did catch my attention, now, after the 10th, I'm bored senseless and deciding whether or not to cancel the sending of the 2nd season. It's a shame because the actors and their characters deserved better. The show is beautiful but the plodding story line isn't worth the time or money invested."
4,The other side of the Carnivale,"This show has an Interesting story, with characters that seem to draw you in. The down side is that some of the seen are very dark and it is hard to tell what is going on. Not sure if they where trying to do this for effect to keep the audience in the dark, show case good and evil in the story, or just did not know how to light the scenes bette. Even with that said I would still watch it and I am even more interested now in watching the second season."
4,I miss this show!,Fantastic Story...Just a shame they never made more than two seasons! I highly recommend that you watch this show. I'd give it 5 stars but I just want more the shows made.
5,HBO classic,"My wife and I took the time to really think about this one and it worked for us. Apparently many, many others did the same... just not enough. HBO does that... they bring us great entertainment like Deadwood etc. Great acting/casting, visually stunning, graphically detailed, historically correct and a twist that is placed inside an already surreal world. Now that both seasons are packaged just make sure you get up to exercise while watching them."
5,Excellent.,This had the potential to be a great series. Hated that they just cut it off and never finished the series
2,Slow...,Maybe I didn't give this one a chance but I just couldn't get into this one. Storyline just didn't capture my attention.
5,"CREEPY,SPOOKY, JUST PLAIN AWESOME!!!!","buy it, buy it, buy it!!!Believe me you are going to get you monys worth. its a nice series that is going to keep ypu waiting for more. Now if you are one of those people who like hardcore season finalies episodes, you my not like this one..."
3,It shouldn't have ended,This was one of the best series I've ever seen but I'm giving it 3 stars because they stopped the series before wrapping it up to satisfaction.
5,Carnivale-the complete first season,"This show is amazing! Very in depth and at times quite confusing. The end of this disk set will leave you completely stupified, but I haven't yet been able to find the next season on DVD. It's worth watching over and over again! You will see something new everytime. I also highly recommend watching it with subtitles on, sometimes it is rather hard to hear. All and all I HIGHLY reccommend it!"
2,String Along,I watched this series based on Amazon recommendations. The series reminds me of a long string along movie where you hope it gets good but doesn't and then has a big let down ending. There is some interesting sex parts and lots of twisted love triangles but that was all it had good. The entire first season was slow to get the plot going. Overall a big let down. Would not buy the season or bother to watch it or recommend it to anyone. Stephen King's The Stand was better than this series with a similar plot of good vs evil.
2,title of review,"This is the most boring tv show I have ever seen. A full hour of the program contains about 10 minutes worth of actual plot and character development. The characters actually are mildly interesting, and the show has a nice visual atmosphere, but my god why must it take soooo long for anything to happen? If you pride yourself on your ability to watch paint dry, check it out."
3,Not great but will do in a pinch,"It does come with a dinky covering that you can put on over it (Re: the previous poster.)It certainly isn't the best memory foam out there but it isn't too stiff and my g/f likes it so I guess it was an ""O.K."" buy."
3,Does this pillow include a washable cover?,I did not purchase this item because Amazon did not include this info. Some memory foam pillows do not include a protective cover. Perhaps someone at Amazon will read this and add that info.
4,Sospender does the job,"I bought several Sospenders (5) 2 35lbs (male) and 3 22lbs (female) in order to be more comfortable on our sailing adventures. Two adult males wore the 35lbs ones on a 32 deg F long 12 hour sailing day this early May here on Lake Michigan and both found them to be very comfortable over our three layers of clothes.Movement was free, I don't know if these less expensive models also feel good in mid-summer when no sweaters, jackets and neck protections are worn.They are definitely give you more free movement than the conventional bulky ski-type vest PFD's.I would buy one again but will never pay more than $150 each unless I need the ""D"" ring life line hook-up"
3,Only the dumbest song on here is in full length extended form!,"Great! Only ""The Politics of Dancing"" is in it's full extended form. There are a few songs that are the 12"" versions but they are SHORTENED! W-H-Why not simply just use less songs.There is another issue I have here? Is not this supposed to be and 80's COMPILATION? So why are there two 90's remixes on this? Oh yeah, they probably could not get the rights to use the original versions or original remixes. In that case, using something else would have sufficed so that the 80's theme could be maintained. While ""Tainted Love"" sounds like it's original counterpart, production wise, the one I was used to was the one that segued into ""Where Did Our Love Go?"", but they probably would have used the edited version that was of just. As for ABC's ""The Look Of Love"" it is a totally housed up version that reflects the early 90's then the early 80's when this song was out.Now, as for a compilation of 80's music, this does a nice job."
3,Not that great...,"This CD contains ""extended club versions"" of the many of the tracks, including Tainted Love and a few others. While this can be ideal for dancing, which is the purpose of this series, it doesn't allow the track to flow as well as it's Single version, which is what most complilations consist of. Don't pay too much for this disc. There are much better compilations out there."
2,Only has a few good songs!,"This 80's New Wave CD is Ok, the only good songs are Dexy's Midnight Runner's, Come On Eileen, The Go-Go's Vacation, Bananarama's Venus, Tears For Fears, Shout, Soft Cells, Tainted Love, Animotion's Obsession, and ABC'S, The Look Of Love, I don't care for the other songs but especially Frankie Goes To Hollywood's Relax for me that song is like nails on a chalkboard!"
3,Halfway Decent 80's New Wave Compilation,"Although I love 80's music (new wave and other), this compilation isn't the best I've heard. I like only about half the songs on here, such as ""Relax"" by Frankie Goes to Hollywood, ""Venus"" by Bananarama, and ""Obsession"" by Animotion, but a couple of other tracks I still haven't been able to get used to, no matter how many times I listen to them, i.e., ""She Blinded Me With Science"" by Thomas Dolby and ""Come On Eileen"" by Dexy's Midnight Runners. Also, even though I like ""Tainted Love"" by Soft Cell, this isn't the version I'm used to; in fact, is this song even done by the band? But if you like the majority of the songs/artists on ""New Wave: the 80s"", then this CD is worth a listen."
3,"Simple, joyfull, danceable","In West African's music, if you say reggae you say Ivory Coast. This CD is a good example of Nigerian Ragga: simple, joyfull, danceable, rich of vitality. The band's leader is Majek Fashek, author of other soloist projects. An onest record for people who are interested to the universe of African Reggae and already have the more famous Alpha Blondy and Lucky Dube."
1,Horrible! Do not buy this!,"This thing is horrible! It's hard to turn off and on and the removable vibrator part actually sits on and rubs ""you know what"",lol. Not pleasant at all. Not even worth $5!"
3,Good repetitious meditation music,"This CD wasn't what I thought it was going to be - it is a repeating line over and over from start to finish, with no variations.That being said - the deep vibrations seep in and evoke a ""meditative state"". The lack of variation is actually good because it isn't distracting.The music seems to be done electronically, instead of by the actual instruments, however that isn't really a negative."
2,Music for Meditation,The sound of the instrument turned out to be more annoying in it'sconstancy then helpful. It droned on forever.
3,Somewhat effective,"It's repetitive, and in that way, somewhat effective. However, I find it difficult to find a happy medium volume-wise, headphones or straight. I'm not able to use it to meditate for sustained periods."
5,This is solar technology for the 2000-decade.,"Yago's book is complete and up-to-date. It is great for homeowners and for system suppliers and electricians who need to learn more about principles and practice. It will help system designers to make wise choices and to understand and maintain their systems. This is a very good text and reference book that will not be obsolete for a long time. It is the book that I wanted to write, but I couldn't sit long enough. (I've been in this business, and writing and teaching, since 1977.)"
4,couldn't put this down!,"This is a great read for anyone who is pregnant/was pregnant/wants to be pregnant! I was greatly inspired by the women in this book who tell us what being pregnant and becoming a Jewish mother means to them. Even after being a mother for almost 9 years, I still enjoyed reading this one-of-a-kind book, and recommended it to my friends."
3,A Basic Needs Machine,"A lot of people feel they need to go out and pay a ton of money for a computer that will do all of the basic stuff most people do. If you are just using a computer to surf the web, do word processing, spreadsheets, and other office stuff then you don't need a high end system. If you want a computer to play graphics intensive games such as Quake 3 and Unreal Tournament or if you are doing video editing, then you are better off looking at other systems or better yet, building your own since most retail system skimp on the graphics card (on-board, TNT2 or Geforce MX instead of a regular Geforce 3 or 4 or a Radeon 8500 card). At any rate, this computer is just fine for the average user."
4,Ultra-Rare French ProgRock Album,"Formed in 1975. Incredibly talented teenage French progressive rock group. This album was recorded in 1978 when the members were all about 18 years old. They had already been playing live for a couple of years. It's a shame this group never made it. This album shows a lot of promise, although it was recorded with limited equipment.They were influenced by Yes, Genesis and King Crimson.If you are a die-hard progressive rock fan you might want this.Only 300 copies of the original vinyl were pressed back in 1978 and they became expensive collectors items in the years that followed. I don't know how many copies of the CD were pressed but probably not many."
4,The Globetrotting Non-Tourist,"This book is a collection of episodes, usually not connected, from six previous Theroux books published in the 70's and 80's. His travels in five different continents are highlighted here with varying degrees of detail. Since his other books describe distinct journeys from beginning to end, Theroux explains in the intro here that this book is meant more as a celebration of the art of traveling itself. He also has some snide insights into the art of travel writing, especially annoying authors who give only a tourist's eye view of the destination but don't bother to say how they got there. Getting there is Theroux's passion and the fragments in this volume usually show him encountering all kinds of intriguing characters and situations around the world, all while on his way somewhere else. That includes the good, the bad, and the ugly - and describing all of these with equal insight is Theroux's greatest strength as a globetrotting non-tourist."
3,A taste.....,"An unfair introduction to Theroux travels. It whets the appetite for those who have read just one or two of his books. For someone who has not read any of his books - well, unfortunately this book would not encourage them to buy the full texts. I don't think it does justice to his writing or his travels. Too short - each story.The books in their entirety draw you in and make you live the experiences with him. I adore his books and his writing style. I love his full texts. By the time you're half drawn into one of these segments, they are over already. Too bad."
4,Great book,How much do I get paid to review the book? I. Just. Want to reach 100% and go forward. Now I'm stuck on 99%. Please let me know. Thanks
2,Squeezing a little more from the old stuff,"Paul Theroux has always been a grump but I have read, and enjoyed, most of his books. In this collection the stories lack continuity and are just a rehash of the same. Don't buy it."
5,Wonderful Snapshots of People & Places,"An amazing demonstration of the writer's ability to capture the essence of people and places with an economy of words. Highly recommend this collection for anyone interested in the art of writing, particularly teachers wishing to inspire their students."
2,Impersonable,"I enjoy reading of some places that are familiar to me from my travels, but really dont like his dry, dry style. There are too many gaps in the story, lack of luster as well as never having any real praise for the majority of the places he sees. There is a real lack of human element. I am dont have a real desire to read any more of his books."
4,niceandlively,strong voices harmonics and song. An excellent record to add to your womens music collection!
4,"Good followup to ""By Myself.""","""Now"" isn't as fulfilling as was ""By Myself"" but is still a good short read for anyone interested in Lauren Bacall. The book covers the 15 years after her first publication ""By Myself."" If you're new to Lauren I would suggest reading ""By Myself"" first and if you would like to see a more personal side of the actress give this book a try."
3,Read the other one first,"Read Bacall's ""By Myself"" before this - she writes as if she assumes that you have. She actually rehashes a lot of what she wrote in that book: her work on Broadway, people in her life, etc. I didn't necessarily mind that - I read this one directly after the other so it complemented it. I would've found it very slight by itself, though. In this one she also talks about putting together her dream home and finding it lacking, and about her grown kids and their lives, some other topics too."
1,A Waste of money!,"This juicier dances all of the table. It starts to move on its on after it is a quarter full of pulp. I have to empty the basket after a half of glass full of juice. If I don't, it move on its on in a circle and side ways across the table. Not good for cabbage juice. Did anyone test this juicier before putting it on the market? I took the advice of your customers review. They must be joking or only drink four ounces of juice. Please save your money and buy a real juicier."
1,Numerous of design flaws.,"The strainer is quite difficult to clean, as pulp gets trapped when you flip it over to clean it. Trying to chase down and remove the loose pulp can be maddening. Also, like others have mentioned, the torque will spin the entire juicer around, and if you're not careful it'll wobble off the container. The press thingy tends to get stuck in the chute because it narrows towards the bottom. Leaks and doesn't handle leafy vegetables well.There are much better juicers on the market."
2,"Nice looking but very, very slow","When I took the unit out of the box I was impressed by the predictable stylings of the KitchenAid machine - until I used it. The feed chute is so small that it takes me 15 minutes to make my juice in the morning. My daughter in law bought the cheaper one from Amazon.com about a month ago called the Juice Fountain. Although I haven't heard of the brand, the unit is very nice looking and it is about 5 times faster to use. I am new to juicing, and don't know if other juicers are like the Kitchenaid, but this really seems to be very slow and labor intensive. It makes great juice and I feel better for drinking it, but I wish I had have bought the cheaper unit.I still have my Kitchenaid mixer and love it dearly, but in my mind, they don't have what it takes in juicers."
1,"This Machine is Wild, if not Dangerous","I have many KitchenAid Appliances from a Dishwasher to the Stand Mixer and Food Processor. I have always been impressed by KitchenAid product's quality construction and exellent function, until now...Upon receiving my KJE500, I tried juicing some carrots. I cut two fairly large carrots in half and started to feed them into the juicer. Fairly quickly (after 1 carrot), the shredded carrots got unbalanced and the machine started to shake a little bit. I decided that this wasn't too bad and continued with the second carrot. Whaoooo horsey!! Halfway into the second carrot, this machine developed a mind of its own started to vibrate wildly and spin around the countertop spilling juice out its spout.Although this machine was well-built & cute I had to send it back. (Note: KitchenAide recommends emptying the basket if it gets out of balance. I didn't think I wanted to have to empty the basket after each and every carrot.)"
5,Kitchenaid juicer,"This is a great product. I bought it mostly because of the name and the fact that it had a citrus juicer attachment included. Boy am I glad I did. We have been making juice almost every day. We love OJ so this is the perfect juicer. We have also juiced carrots, apples, grapes, lemons and oranges. We have noticed that is does move alittle mostly due to the hi-power motor that they use. I find the product fairly easy to clean and of very high quality."
2,IM NOT IMPRESSED,I USED IT IN MY HALLWAY THINKING I COULD ZIP THROUGH THE EDGING JOB LIKE THEY DID ON QVC. NOT... AS LONG AS YOU KEEP PAINT ON THE ROLLER YOU HAVE A CHANCE OF A STRAIGHT LINE BUT TOUCH THE PLASTIC WITH PAINT AND YOUR DEAD. I DONT USUALLY WRITE REVIEWS BUT QVC`S PROMO SUCKED ME IN AND I DONT LIKE THAT.GET A SURLINE EDGER FROM LOWES FOR FIVE BUCKS AND YOU WILL GET THE SAME RESULTS..
4,Intriguing mystery,"""Death in the Air""--also titled ""Death in the Clouds""--is a historical mystery set in 1934 in England and France. (Of course, it was a contemporary mystery at the time it was written.)The mystery was intriguing because it could have gone several ways as to whodunit. I guessed several elements of the ""big reveal"" about whodunit, and there were enough clues that you could guess whodunit (though I caught them partly because I've read so many Christie mysteries). The characters were interesting as was the unique setting for the murder, but mainly it was the puzzle of whodunit that kept me interested.There was no sex. There were some explicit bad words and swearing. Overall, I'd recommend this intriguing mystery."
4,flying to fate,Poirot is flying for the frist time. Trying to sleep likethe lady in row one. Only unlike Poirot she dose not wake up.So stats Death in the Air.
1,Not very accurate,Received the Taylor 49562 outdoor thermometer the other day and compared it to a known good outdoor thermometer and the Taylor is 4 degrees off (hot). It's not very well made either. I'm thinking about sending it back.
1,Fine unless you want an accurate temp reading,"While this mounted easily, the temperature readings were at least 10 degrees too high when compared to a digital thermometer nearby.Tried making adjustments (there is no back to it, so the temperature coil is right there) but there wasn't any sort of adjustment screw or any way to set the thing like you might a scale.Very disappointing."
5,You be chillin' or cooking with this one,"This a great thermometer, not cheap like the plastic ones, easy to read with a sharp point on the dial tip."
2,Too much airy speculation about death and consciousness.,"Readers expecting useful information on the book's subtitle, ""Free Energy, UFOs and Other Scientific Revelations"", will be disappointed, Although a scientist, O'Leary is light on the science of free energy. He is far more concerned with death, consciousness, personal introspection, transcendence, parapsychology and resurrecting Gaia than in offering a strong explanation of advances in energy technology. O'Leary still thinks there are remains of a lost civilization on Mars. ""Finding Myself in the New Consciousness"" would have been a better description."
4,Gum is great,"As a person who LOVES gum, this is just not enough for me. If you are just a gum admirer... then this is for you! It doesn't matter which kind of gum you like... just as long as you like it!"
4,Another great one from Griffin,"BEHIND THE LINES is yet another riveting novel in the Corps series from W.E.B. Griffin. Read ALL of his fine novels, he is the master. I've just finished the new WWII airwar novel, THE TRIUMPH AND THE GLORY, which, by the way, was terrific, and plan to read again the Brotherhood of War books. I'll have a busy summer but will enjoy every minute."
5,Four times is still not enough...,"I've been a Griffin fan for about seven years. I've read all of Griffins books at least once; the Corp's series books twice, except for ""Behind the Lines"", which I just finished for the fourth time. All of Griffins books are very vivid in detail and make you feel as if you're actually there. In some cases, I wish I were. I have recommended many of his books to my friends who are now loyal fans. One of them read the Corp series in ten days. He said they were the best he's ever read, and agreed with me that ""Behind the Lines"" was his favorite, too. Like many other fans of the Corp series, Griffin needs to finish this series of books. The only fault he has is that the Corp series books are too far between each other. Many other fans will agree to get on with the Corps and write less about the other series."
4,the entire series is excellent,"This series leaves you want more, Griffins ability to mix fact with fiction is unsurpassed. I truly hope the this is not the end of the series. The only drawback is you have to wait so long for the next book, although it does give you a good reason to go back and start to read the series over!"
4,"Great Book, Puzzleing slip in main characters religion","I have read everything Mr. Butterworth (Griffin) has put into print and indeed he really has shown a complete knowledge of the military and the people who spend their lives as soldiers. What puzzles me is how the alterboy, son of the grand commander of the Knights of Columbus, whose sister was almost a num becomes, in this book an episcopalian. Did Mr. Butterworth just forget? A, G, Russell, ag@agrussell.com"
1,Behind the Lines,"Behind the Lines by W.E.B. Griffin is, in my opinion, one of his finest books in ""The Corps"" series. The seller shipped my audio cassettes of this book to me in an extremely prompt manner. Cassettes and the box were all in excellent condition.However, I cannot read all sides of the 4-sided tapes. The first two sides of each tape plays well in my 4-track cassette player, but the second and fourth sides require the use of a stereo player with two balance adjustments. To play the last two sides of the tapes, you must adjust the balance on the stereo player. I do not have a stereo player that accommodates cassette tapes and, therefore, cannot listen to the book. I am very disappointed about this and recommend t o prospective future buyers that they ascertain if the cassette tapes being ordered will work wit h their cassette players."
4,Good reading,"This is the 7th in a series of 10. If you like the Marine Corps and historical fiction, this is the series for you."
4,The Ultimate Marine Book,Although it has little action Behind the Lines gives a behind the scenes look at how the war in the Pacific was planned and won.
2,little old,"It is not recent. but is OK. The package is very bad, I made exchane three times still have scrached DVD. I finaly give up."
4,Some great moments,"Probably not as indespensible as _Rising Force_ (a creative, excellent album) as it is very uneven, but has some great moments. Joe Lynn Turner is on vocals this time around, and the music definitely has a very glammy, 80's-era Rainbow feel to it, culminating with the ultra-cheezy hit ""Heaven Tonight"". But there is some amazing stuff on this album once you dig into it. ""Hold On"" is a great piece and showcases the good that JLT can do for this incarnation of Yngwie's band. There's also good to be had with ""Bite The Bullet/Riot In The Dungeons"" and ""Krakatau"", both of which are in the vein of Yngwie's earlier compositions. But ""Dreaming (Tell Me)"" is the rather early climax, a dreamy, acoustic-tinged piece with an absolutely crushing solo at the end. Its probably Yngwie's finest moment on any of his albums, and the reason this is a four-star review and not 2-1/2."
2,SAD ....,"It's very funny. The great guitar player who wrote powerful metal songs about vikings and queens, now singing chorus as "" OOOH , NOW IT'S THE TIME, FEELING YOUR HEART SO CLOSE TO TIME..."" ( from the song ""Now It's the Time"" ). Then, we have the ""majestic"" (I'm joking ) ""HEAVEN TONIGHT"", that should make Bon Jovi and Poison proud. Joe Lynn Turner managed to do the same thing he did while he was in RAINBOW: convince the great guitarrists that it was time to make some money and sell out. Of course this album has great guitar playing by Yngwie. But it's so heartless and cheesy, it's almost unbeliavable it was recorded that way. Forget it."
1,ARE YOU KIDDING ME ???,"""HOLD ON"", ""NOW IT'S THE TIME"", ""HEAVEN TONIGHT"", ""DREAMING"" ?? What is this ? A NSYNC album ??!! OF course Malmsteen is playing fast as ever, his solos at the speed of light. But this CD is awful, due to the presence of Joe Lynn Turner on it, one the worst so-called ""metal"" vocalists ever to arise. Owner of a great voice, he unfortunately only wants to sing cheesy songs."
1,Beginning of downhill..,"THe Swede master released a total commercial failure. Look at the tittle tracks ""HEAVEN TONIGHT"", ""NOW IS THE TIME"", ""HOLD ON"". COmpare them with ""I AM A VIKING"", ""I'LL SEE THE LIGHT TONIGHT"", etc. Sad. The proof that he tried so hard to be totally commercial was the addiction of singer Joe Lynn Turner, who never convinced anyone."
1,SAD...,"Whatever good intentions this album might have been, they were buried as soon as Malmsteen succumbed to commercial pressure and entered the glam phase, also dressing like posers and having their hairs ""stilyzed"" to look like female models!! The hiring of Joe Lynn Turner was an absurd step. And he came full with an arsenal of silly / cheesy / pop love lyrics, changing this ODYSSEY into one of the worst Malmsteen albuns ever."
5,Legends arn't born every day,"Yngwie Malmsteen had suffered an injury to his picking hand when he crashed his farrari, and also found out some record executives had swindled him bigtime. Fans wern't sure if his next album would hold up in the guitar god technique department... but the rest is history. This album blows flames out of the sides when you open it. The singer is the best ever, the keyboardist and drummer are twin brothers and Malmsteens chops and tone are holding the metal scene hostage with lethal weapons. He slaughters naysayers and burys them with taste. This is a five star neo classical extraviganza!!!"
4,YNGWIE GOES POP,"WITH THE RADIO-FRIENDLY VOICE OF JOE TURNER{RAINBOW} YNGWIE PUTS OUT HIS 4TH ALBUM. NOT BAD BUT TOO MANY 80'S STYLE HAIR-BAND SONGS. AND HE WONDERS WHY PEOPLE DON'T TAKE HIM SERIOUSLY. THE 4 STARS ARE FOR HIS BEST VOCAL SONG EVER, ""FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT"". THIS SONG TAKES OFF WHERE DEEP PURPLE'S ""BURN"" & ""HIGHWAY STAR"" LEFT OFF. ONCE AGAIN, THE LAST SONGS ARE THE BEST. THIS GUY SHOULD JUST PLAY THE GUITAR AND FORGET TRYING TO SELL ALBUMS."
3,Good album,"When I got this album, I had not heard anything from it. This was my third Yngwie album, my first being Rising Force and Trilogy. Of course, I was expecting something very similar to these recordings. WRONG! Well, it's not TOTALLY different--the lightning fast alternate and sweep picking lines are still there--but overall it sounded much more commercial than RF and Trilogy. Still, a good listen, so I suggest owning it."
3,One Of Yngwie's Best,"I've always liked this album. It's got some good stuff on it. I'm not a big fan of the singer, but Yngwie's guitar playing is very good though. The songs are all pretty well-written. ""Hold On,"" ""Dreaming,"" and ""Krakatau,"" are the best tunes. Good album."
2,Disappointing,"As a child, I liked Fritz's books,so I was thrilled to discover her autobiography. Unfortunately, this work is depressing and dull. The character ""Jean"" came across as spoiled, whiny, and rude to her parents. As a child, I might have found her type of behavior brave and daring. As an adult, it was irritating. I'm not sure who the audience is intended to be: the book isn't written well enough for adults, and it is too somber for childen. The depiction of China is interesting though, with its unromanticized view of the Chinese."
2,Homesick: My own story review,"Homesick: My Own Story by Jean Fritz is a story about an American girl who grows up in China. She spends a good part of her life wishing she could be in America, where she belongs. WHen she's not doing that, she'scorresponding with her grandmother,trying to make friends with some young chinese children,and learning british culture in school.As you can see, Jean Fritz would be an excellent storywriter had she made it up. However, this story is an autobiography, and is in almost no way fictional. Jean Fritz is an excellent storywriter anyway, though. Jean Fritz describes the setting as if her pen were a plane ticket. Her story line makes it difficult to locate the plot, or even understand the full story. The autobiography is punctuated by emotions. All in all, this is a fine educational history text, but is not, in my opinion, a fitting storybook."
4,some sad parts but worth reading,I gave this book four stars because I didn't like the sad parts. The book was well-written. The author helped me see the story of a ten-year-old girl whose father works for the YMCA in China. She knows she's going to go home to the US but that there are lots of obstacles. After reading this book. I understand more about the history of China and the coolies and the culture. I am a fan of Jean Fritz books in general.
4,Homeless: a perfect american classic story,"This book was a perfect book for any junior student. It had the perfect story and it was perfect for any pre-teenage child. I thoroughly enjoyed this story and I am sure that others will too. The idea is wonderful and the way this was written is also wonderful....it is a MUST read!!!!!!! Please, read it....u have not read any book if you have not read this book...."
3,It's okay.,"It doesn't look as new as the other two books I've ordered, but it's one hundred percent readable. It's a good book!"
5,Transformation on the way!,Stephen Arroyo has a beautiful and gentle way of connecting the study of astrology and life. This is a MUST have for all students of astrology to see and understand the unavoidable knocks on the door to transform our lives!
2,too complicated,i am a novice at astrology. This book is not for the novice.It is too complicated for me. I wanted something simple and fun to read.
5,Important focus,"In the current shift of astrological focus from events to psychology, this study is an invaluable step forward."
5,The best astrology book,"This is a profound book, and simply the best astrology book I have ever read. It's long & detailed, but not dense. Arroyo's philosophical & humanistic bent is wonderful. This is a very helpful & wide ranging book for the practicing astrologer - not a quickie book, but a serious bit of teaching. It's one of the books I'd take to a desert island!"
1,A lovely binocular-shaped paperweight.,"I'm a Scotsman at heart so when I saw these binox at such a low price I had to have 'em. Turns out, they're not only inexpensive, but they're really cheap. The rubber ""armor"" is thin and ill-fitting. The underlying binoculars are fragile and poorly assembled. The optics are atrocious. The exact center of one's field of view can be brought into focus only with difficulty. The rest of the view is badly distorted."
5,"Horses, Cows, and Other People","This is a fine collection of moving and often funny essays growing out of the author's trials and triumphs on a farm in the hills east of Atlanta, Georgia. More than the usual ""back to the earth"" escapade, author Russell created a working, livable farm out of some lovely wooded acreage and an old farmhouse that she had moved onto the property. The story of that move, with its encounters with narrow bridges, tree limbs, and school children dismissed from class to watch the spectacle, is typical of the book's essays: a wonderful eye for detail, and a humorous but respectful feel for the people who inhabited this adventure. Best moments include her discovery of the differences between cows and horses--a fall-down funny episode--and her depictions of the creatures (including people, of course) and the natural scene of her beloved corner of rural Georgia. It is no ""stretch"" to compare her writing with that of Thoreau."
2,"Interesting storyline, but shallow writing","Good ideas, good settings, but the best thing about the novels was the characters, who were interesting and fairly well developed. However, the writing was shallow and talentless, and the story lacked energy."
4,"A slow read, but worth the effort...","It was only by a fluke that I even picked up the Darksword trilogy, but I must say I enjoyed it thoroughly. It took a lot of effort to get through the first book, but by the time I finished it, I found myself completely engrossed in the story and insatiably curious about the other two books. This is a world that I love, and characters I can relate to!"
4,Very good series ..,What can I say?? This is the book that got me hooked into reading Fantasy and Sci-Fic. Making magic a everyday reality and than throwing a person who can not use it as an aberation...what more is there to know.. Read and let your imagination fly through a very well put together series from the writers of Dragon Lance Books.
4,"The first of the trilogy, it is somewhat slow.","Being the first in a trilogy, it is somewhat slow, due to the fact it has to explain everything about the world. I liked the book and I would recommend it. The one good thing about this book, is that you never know what to expect. And everytime you think you do, you don't! Taking place where magic abilities is a prerequisite, it is very hard to survive otherwise. But Joram somehow does! This book tells the tale of his early life"
3,Good...yet lacking,This was a pretty good lead off book yet seemed to lack the energy that these two authors are well known for. The characters were very well developed. The most excitement was in the last few pages. I hope that the rest of the series picks up. These are two GREAT authors and if any of you have read their other work you know what I mean. I am going to give the other books in this series a chance...we'll see what happens.
1,disappointed,"while i love weis and hickman, this series was a huge disappointment. i was so swept away by the Death Gate Cycle that i didn't even second guess that these book would be good. the story had no drive and the main character was very confusing to me. he was conflicted and he never grew beyond his past. i felt that alot more could have been done to develop the characters and make them stronger. the world that they created was beautful, but the people weren't as vivid. i highly recommend the Death Gate Cycle, those books will not disappoint you."
3,A nice novel,"The novel is quite nice and easy to read. I would have liked a more profound narration about technology and why ,although banned, outcasts use it. After all, only the main character has absolutely no magic (aka Life)."
4,PROSE,"This writer is [was--he died] mastered writing...turns of phrase...etc. This is excellent for writers to learn ""how it's done."" Beautifully-written stories, with superb crafting using metaphor, simile...""show don't tell."""
1,Would not buy this one again,It served it's purpose for a party but this tray has no bottom and is difficult to carry. You cannot carry it one-handed. It must be carried with 2 hands by the bottom rims. The bottom is open and your fingers push the containers up and out. Buy one with a solid bottom and don't waste your money on this model.
4,Good and Bad Features,"This is a nice bar cady and has removeable compartments, however it does not have a bottom. So If something leaks it goes onto the counter instead of being trapped within the cady"
3,Essential for entertaining when the bar is open,Very nice quality for the money but you may want to consider spending a little more for a model with a top that can be sealed for short-time storage. I like the space under the cups. I put backup lemons and limes in the bottom with some ice -- especially handy when the party is outside on a hot day.
4,"Good looking, quality is fine","Not a top of the line product, but for the price it more than serves its purpose. Each tray will pop out so that you can clean them. Sits nicely, open bottom."
2,looks great not to functional,"This is a nice bar cady and has removeable compartments, however it does not have a bottom. So you can't ice down your items."
3,Super Reader,"The US military fraternity asks the Saint for a favour in tracking the daughter of a spy that has vanished when she receives a communication from her father.Needless to say, multiple nogoodniks are also interested in this young woman, and the possibilities of what she might find, particularly as it probably involves oodles of cash.2.5 out of 5"
5,my review,I don't have this exact same dvd but i have the same shows on another one and both of the episoces are very funny!ESpeciaally the christmas episode ! the guest star is mel blanc and he is very funny!(he is also the voice of bugs bunny and many other cartoon characters). the quality of these episodes is pretty clean and the sound is mostly free of hissing. these episodes are good
5,&0% of our body is Water,"when I was introduced to masaru I ordered a couple of his books, cards ets very interesting material to read. If you want to learn about your BODY....planet and watre please read his material...."
5,Decent stiff brush for mud,"This brush works well for mud removal when used in conjunction with a good curry comb.*********** THREE YEAR UPDATE ***********************After three years of regular use, this Oster brush is still in excellent condition and works as well as it did when it was new. We use a variety of Oster brushes on our Percheron and Mustangs daily."
5,ARROW STAPELES,"I HAD BEEN TRYING TO FIND THIS PRODUCT LOCALLY, SO I TRIED YOU AND GOT EXACETLY WHAT I WANTED AND RECEIVED IT PROMPTLY.. THANKS HAROLD"
2,Save your money.,1. Let us me honest. SAVE YOUR MONEY and buy a cyclone.2. Penn State Industries makes a great cyclone dust collect that is close in price. Buy it.2. I purchase this over priced product from this website. The product was deliever and went to gather rather quickly (45 min. one person with breaks). Whet out and purchased better nuts and bolts then it came with.It is loud and bulky.3. After some time I sold it to woodworking shop for as a dedicated machine for a table saw. Then I purchased a cyclone and never looked back.
3,my least favorite CD but still decent,Still a decent album minus the somewhat bad production/mixing. I'm sure once Andy Sneap remixes it it will be alot better. Still worth having but definately not their best.
2,It had to happen sooner or later...,"If I weren't biased, I would have only given one star.Every good band does it... sell out. You can hear some of each song in every song on this album. Nevermore's last masterpiece was DEAD HEART, after that...It's not that the songs are BAD. They're just linear. On DEAD HEART, NM switched gears with each song. This was especially so on their EP IN MEMORY. Each song was a masterpiece you could hang on the wall and admire as an individual work of art.ENEMIES is a collection that you get the sense of the genius behind it only collectively. None of the songs really stand out on their own merit.But hey. Awesome band. These aren't guitar-slinging nuts, these are musicians to be reckoned with. Their guitar work is unrivaled and the lyrics aren't just to meat up the sound.They just didn't dispense with their talent as well as they usually do, that's all.But that doesn't discredit their value as a legendary band."
1,Remixed P.O.S.!!!!!,"I can't beleive all of these wussies that think that the remix is better. I just listened to it and have put it in my sell pile. Sure it's crisper, but all of the raw power is gone and the drum cymbols sound like wind chimes now. There is too much going on now. Too many voice overs and and not enough grinding. My god it sounds like System Of A Down now!!! What a waste. Go buy the original release, the one with balls. Not this hip-hop trendy metal"
1,WTF?,When I first heard this band I thought it was a joke. The singing was unbelievablly horrible. It does not fit the music at all. The music itself is not bad but the singing is a bigger disappointment than the new Damageplan CD. If you are any fan of anything heavey dont waste your time or money on this joke.
3,"GREAT Disc, BAD sound!!!","OK, this is possibly Nevermore's greatest disc to date. It is short, around 40 minutes with no filler. Someone set Jeff Loomis loose in the guitar room and he went completley nuts. Furious riffs and the sterling vocals of Warrel Dane make this one of the best CD's of the year.The problem is the mix, this is supposed to be the last album they do with Century Media so maybe this has something to do with it ... how else do you explain a CD that sounds like it was recorded live through a funnel? then filtered through a water pipe so that all highs and lows are removed leaving a muddled sound that consists of pure mid-range rubish. It crackles on high end speakers and makes me wish for some nice finger nails on a chalk board to screech, thus distracting me from the horror I am hearingKelly Grey produced the disc, if he is responsible for the sound then someone needs to tear off his arm and beat him about the head and shoulders with it."
3,Just ok guys,My problem in this album is the vocals.I'm not speaking for the sound of his voice (to tell you the truth i don't like it but lets say ok) but the rhythm of his voice. I cant find any good melody in the vocals not even chorus. Its completely unacceptable. There are some good points in the music that's why i have rated this album with 3 stars - its just ok . Nothing more nothing less
1,What went wrong?,I demand a better sounding final mix. Remove the fuzz and mud. Not worth the money I paid. This is not the record I have waited this long to hear. Avoid at all cost. WHP (weapon of horrible production)
3,What happened to the guitar?,"I agree that this is a much cleaner version of this recording......but that's it.What happened to that burly-assed guitar sound? On this remix, the tone is much too bright, scooped-out and homogenized. All those monstrous low-mids have been sucked right out, and what's left is something far less aggressive. That raw, raging guitar sound is, to me, what made Nevermore great.I spent some time comparing the two mixes, A/B-ing song after song, and I have to say that I prefer the meaner tone with a bit muddier drums to this new version."
4,Very Solid Sign,"I did an embarrassingly large amount of research into various ""Turkey Crossing"" signs before buying this one, and we've been quite pleased to mount it on our front fence right where the wild turkeys like to dash across the street. Be forewarned this is not a full-size road sign, but about half height (you really don't want a full-sized sign for residential use). The turkey logo's crisp, and it had pre-drilled holes top and bottom for nails or screws, and the whole thing has held up well in the weather. Gobbble gobble!!"
2,Great Songs undone by poor audio quality,"Let me say, that I'm not a big fan of EC, but I really love his work with Cream. So when I brought the boxed set home, I immediately put in CD two and prepared myself to be blown away. I was, but not by the music, but by the horrendous sound quality of the CDs...The quality was so bad that I returned the boxed set for a refund."
4,I'm a fan of Eric Clapton,"Okay, I'm not a EC fan for a long time, I'm 16. But I love this box set. Every classics are there (with an unreleased version of I shot the Sheriff, who contains a killer solo). It makes my day; I play guitar, so..."
5,What a riot!,"We use this book at late-night parties -- reading sections out loud brings raucous laughter and sometimes prolonged discussion. One game is to substitute certain words -- for example, everytime the book uses the word ""kissing"" in its advice to teenagers about the perils of getting too forward on the first date, you choose some other word, some other activity, and say that word instead. What a gas!"
5,Great Comic Read!,this is the funniest book I have ever read. My favorite chapter is called Expressing Affection. I think it is hilarious that people might have followed this strictly at one time. No offense to those who did. It is just funny in this day and time and sometimes i wish boys still acted this way.
4,"Nice roller, first for me and more durable than others","Checked out a few flimsy ones at the store before reading the reviews and ordering this. Great product, only complaint is that it could be a little longer (TWSS). I use it more often than 'The Stick'."
4,Helped my ITB,"I have a sore spot on my ITB on my thigh, and this really worked to get rid of it. I will say this thing is hard as a rock and I guess I would have bought a softer one if I knew just how hard this thing is, but it works for sure, and a good price."
5,Great Product,Seems to be durable and softens up nicely after a week or so of use. You will love how you feel if used consistently.
5,helpful for bursitis,"This is one helpful / painful little foam roller that works wonders if you are suffering from bursitis in your hips. It is a love hate relationship with me. I know it is good, but it hurts so bad to roll around on the very firm foam."
4,eva foam roller,"It's good value for the money. Yes. It is hard and is a bit painful on the tight muscles, but that's what you want. It seems to be a good quality and good value.I only just bought it but it looks like it'll hold up for a long time"
1,NOT high density,"I specifically ordered this foam roller (24"", not 18"") because the term ""high density"" was in the name and it was 24"", which is the ideal length for a combination of home and travel use. This is NOT a high-density roller. I thought it would be comparable to the black high-density foam rollers (which do not come in 24"" length) that I have used during PT sessions; it is not. It is in fact much softer. Additionally, when I compared it side by side with my old white foam roller, it is actually softer than that one as well. While the density of this roller does not seem to be a problem for others, the term ""high density"" is misleading and if you are looking for a roller that is actually high density, I suggest you stick with one of the black ones."
3,It's okay,"If I had a DVD for excercises to go with this short fat roller I would use it, but I didn't order the right DVD for this roller. So will probably never use. Would be fine otherwise. Didn't know you had to get just the right roller for the DVD i ordered. I just thought a roller was a roller. My mistake. Paid for something I will never use."
5,Great Roller!,"I have used J/Fit rollers for years now and will continue to use them for a few reasons. They are consistently reliable, maintain roller density after multiple uses daily for YEARS at a time (Use them on multiple clients 6-days a week) for years at a time. I give them as gifts to family and friends knowing that I am giving the gift of health and really helping them out with such a small investment. Get one, I have one in every room of the house, and continue to remain injury free and flexible."
4,stays firm throughout stretches,I bought this for my husband to roll out his IT band. The roller doesn't compact during his stretches but stays firm throughout his routine. It is large enough where it rolls easily across the surface. Would highly recommend this to anyone who has difficulty with their IT band.
1,Ouch. Try body rolling balls instead.,"My chiropractor recommended this roller. I tried to use it diligently to improve my back and neck. I finally gave up because it was just too painful and I wasn't seeing ANY results after 2 weeks of use. The roller hurt my spine and the muscles weren't relaxing. My flexibility didn't increase at all. My abs were getting a bit of a workout. I've recently gotten a Yamuna body roller ball. THIS is what I wanted. Doing similar exercises with the ball as I had done with this roller is wonderful! The ball gives a little more, but contacts less surface area. It really gets some pressure on the muscles and helps massage and relax them. And, unlike this roller, the ball doesn't put any pressure on the spine itself."
1,Foam Roller,This item is not useful as I had thought. It is hard like a brick. It will be catching dust in my home.
2,too hard,"just received the 6'x 36'. if you want this for massage or exercise, i think its WAY WAY too hard! if you want this for a weapon, it will probably cause quite a concussion. its too cheap to return so i am banging it with a hammer to see if it will get softer. the one they have at my gym is so much softer and useable."
4,foam roller,It supports full weight of body and is great as a tool to roll under your back and shoulders - lower back to neck to help relax muscles. Well made.
5,Keeps me moving,"My wife and I use this thing daily. I hike a lot and bike commute a lot. I am 60 years old. I get a fair amount of professional massage therapy, where they are amazed at how badly my muscles are beat up. This thing makes a huge difference in comfort and mobility between massages. Amazing how rolling the legs on all sides can help the knees. Decent density. Only occasionally do I wish it would be a bit higher density. Its a perfect density for rolling out the back.I like the 18"" length. Its easier to use that length in the somewhat cramped space of the TV room, and is a great way to make productive use of your TV time. Its plenty wide."
3,A little bulky,I wasn't sure what type of foam roller to choose when I was searching online. I bought this a couple years ago. It is durable--it's held up to my kids' interest in it. It's effective. I can really feel the impact on my muscles as I roll it out. But the reasons I can't give it five stars are: it's bulky and long which makes it hard to store. And I need a lot of space and open room to use it and roll across the floor. I think I would benefit from having one a little thinner and shorter for my needs.
5,Absolutely Love This Album,"This is my favorite George Winston album, along with Autumn. I like a wide variety of music, and I find that this album is such a great change of pace when I want some instrumental, yet very moving music, especially on a cold winter's day in the midwest. If you like contemporary piano music, this album is a must."
5,War in Heaven; were we there?,"This is a very thought provoking book! I consider myself a nondenominational christian, so I am open to unorthodox views, if they can be supported by scriptures. Believe me there is a lot in this book that I disagree with, mainly the concept of reincarnation. But if I understand the way Charles DeLoach is presenting it, different than the traditional Eastern Hindu, Buddhists philosophy, I have to stop and think!The biblical example of Elijah as John the Baptist is compelling if not totally conclusive, but if that is true does that mean we are former angels? I can't tell you that I have it all figured out, but I appreciate the research Charles has done on this subject and I for one will prayerfully study it more. I highly recommend this book."
2,Where's the Funk?,"I am a dedicated fan of funk music - I went to see George Clinton this past summer - and I was very excited to get this CD. However, with the exception of the first track which is a great classic, this album is much closer to hip-hop than to funk. The problem truly lies in the fact the there were not really any great funk hits during the 80s. This album would be better titled, ""Songs that have some semblence of funk, but sound like hip-hop, and happened to have been moderately popular in the 80s."" OK, that's a terrible title, but ""Funk Classics"" leads one to assume that there will be funk music on the album, of which there is scarcely any."
2,awful and trashy but loved the name-dropping,I bought this book at a 99 cents only store - and it was worth MAYBE that price!!! The author(s) writing was pretty juvenile - it was not a literary masterpiece...but for 99 cents it was okay if only for the famous names.
3,a very sad book,"This book was hyped as being some sort sexy romp through gossip land. Actually it's very sad. The authors were all pretty girls who went to Hollywood and ended up on the dark side. For every wide eyed innocent who makes it big in movies there are 100 who end up in porn, prostitution, stripping or as groupies.The authors all were pathetic women who had encounters with some of Hollywoods sickest, meanest stars. This is not a fun or light hearted book. Some of it is sickening and will really make you rethink your entertainment choices."
2,Trashy but amusing,"Ok, so its the Jerry Springer of literature, but its bawdy and lecherous and rowdy and doesn't command any brain function whatsoever on my part. In other words, I read it for the same reason I still watch jerry Springer. It gives me a taste of the seedy side of life with no actual effort from me."
2,There are two sides to every story!,"A very entertaining book, but not very thought-provoking and extremely biased. I've lived in Hollywood and I can tell you that not every little girl is a victim. None of these ho's would complain if Brad Pitt offered them a million dollars to sleep with them. But instead they hook up with socially inept, awkward and immature power players whose only crime is not having the time or the skills to romance a lady properly whether or not those biatches deserves it. And most of the no-talent gold-diggers who publish tell all novels don't.T. L. Young"
4,Before there was Superhead,"...there was these girls. It was a very sad story about ""regretful"" hoes who don't in the end seem truly sorry for having been hoes. Some girls are born to be hoes and that's just a fact. They tell us about who's good in bed and who's wierd/nasty and who's wack. Its not a book you'd go looking to buy but if you walked by it in a store and saw it you'd want to check it out. I read this when I was young and i learned a lot about the ways of the world. I do believe at least one of the girls who had a section in this book seemed upset with herself for her past, but I got the feeling the others would do it all over the same way.--------i'd like to change this to 3.5 stars"
2,Give me a break,"Total trash. Funny, the women tell their stories but none of the real consequences like STDs, unwanted pregnancies, abuse. Fast read without substance. Good for an airplane. Bought it because it was cheap. And we wonder why Bill Clinton's eye wandered. This book says it all...until women draw the line, men will make the rules."
3,Conflicted.,"This book can't decide if it is Celebrity Gossip or anti-prostitution.While starting out with a blurb from someone writing about the terrible world of women being dragged down into prostitution, the girls go on talking about their jobs with the calmness of a fast-food worker talking about his job. The women ramble on for pages and pages about the gifts they got and the free shopping sprees, and they would even talk about the sex in a non-committal way. For some of them, it only seems like they felt like they were wronged when they were spurned by their ""boyfriends"".Don't get me wrong, that world really does chew up women and spit them out. It's just this book does a really inconsistent job of pointing that out to readers.Also - if you were born past the time this book covers, or like me during that era weren't paying attention a lot of attention to soaps and gossip magazines, the ""big names"" won't mean squat to you."
3,Victims?,"I don't know. Am I really supposed to feel sorry for these girls? Sure, one of them was definately abused as a young teen, but for the most part these girls were not victims of men. They were their own worst enemies. They chose to become high priced call girls. They brag about the perks, the money, the drugs. And then they complain b/c the men didn't have ""feelings"" for them. Uh, they are call girls. It IS all about sex. It IS all about their sexy bodies. This book is supposed to make us aware of the pitfalls of prostitution. I just see the pitfalls of stupidity. They willingly spent their money on drugs. No one forced them to blow (literally) their money. They weren't beaten/forced into prostitution by sick fathers/boyfriends. They were beautiful young girls who willingly used their bodies to gain entry to celebrities, money, parties, drugs. And now I'm supposed to feel sorry for them? Whatever. It was entertaining reading, but didn't dredge up the sympathy that it was supposed to."
2,"Campy, but true.",These girls are a little less real than the ones I know in the business. My friends talk about IRA's and retiring at 35. Not about John Ritter. In fact they will not discuss any clients by name. These women come across as just plain stupid sometimes. Good read if you like the dirt on others sex lives. If you are looking for literary merit...skip it.
4,Great Mask,I really liked this mask. I could feel it getting deep down into my skin and my face was soft and refreshed after I used it. I have very oily skin and this mask was great for getting all of the dirt and oil out of my skin.
2,Petunia,"The book is wonderful but the copy I received was not the original hardback with outer cover. It was, instead, a smaller child's cardboard back book which is not at all what I thought that I was purchasing. Hence, I was very much disappointed but kept it for an extra copy in our library. The advertising led me to believe that it was the original hardback . . . I am not happy about that which I feel was deceptive advertising."
5,Classic Kids' Books,"This is a book I remembered vaguely from my own childhood and bought for my son on a whim. He loves it. In fact, he received it on Christmas day and has insisted that it be read at bedtime every night since then. Literally.So, will your child love it? Probably so. Will you? Probably so, at first. For our part, my husband and I are growing a little weary of it. But in the land of childrens books, that's probably the best you can hope for, right?The illustrations are fun and entertaining and the language is clear and fun. I'd give this as a gift again, or would certainly recommend it to others."
4,traditional,"It approximated my memory of a well written and well illustrated version unlike most cartoon-like,oversimplified versions. That allllllall and all!"
1,Goldilocks,"I read the book Goldilocks And The Three Bearsby Jim Aylesworth and illustrated by BarbaraMcClintock. This book is about a little girl named Goldilocks who snuck in the three bearshouse eating their porridge, sitting in their chairs, and sleeping in their beds. The authorwrote this story because he wanted to tell youthat don't go on peoples property withoutpermission. The conflict is person verses personbecause Goldilocks went in the three bears house without permission. I think Goldilocksis sneaky and the author made the three bearsnice and understanding. The other version ofGoldilocks And The Three Bears is the sameas this one. Kids should read this book because they will learn a lesson to respect people's property.I liked this book because I like how the author wrote the story because it wasn't too easy or too hard. I didn't like the book because I didn't like the book because I didn't like the illustrations because they looked kind of weird."
1,Infamous heat sink,"I've had a lot of laptops in my career, and this one is by far the worst. I've been waiting for windows vista to come out before I buy a new laptop, so I've had the chance to get very well aquainted with this machine. I've figured out how to manage the computer so that it doesn't overheat and die on me--basically, I cannot run anything that takes up a lot of memory. No games, multimedia programs, interactive websites...This computer get hot fast and shuts down without warning. I thought it was only my machine at first, but I've found out that the problem is common and that compaq offers a heat sink repair kit that doesn't really work either...I recommend against buying one of these machines unless you have no other alternative or you get it for less than 100 bucks."
3,"Great features, terrible durability",Cronic heat related problems with Laptop shutting down after a few minutes of use. Keyboard issues after just a few months. Compaq/HP did a lousy job addressing cronic Heatsink issue. They made a fix and listed it on their parts website for $50.00 + dollars. I have read a number of complaints on this issue. I won't buy an HP/Compaq product again. Will sell as is for $600.00!
1,"Thin, weakly pigmented -- not finger paint!","Finger paint is supposed to be thick and gloppy -- that's what makes it so satisfying to smoosh around on the paper. It's also supposed to be richly pigmented and glossy, thereby providing a fun visual and tactile experience. This 'finger paint' is thin -- more the consistency of poster paint, and the color is weak. As soon as my children spread the paint around on the paper the color all but disappeared. We were left with a watery mess with the barest hint of green. What a disappointment! I have written to the company and am waiting a response. Meanwhile, I've ordered a different brand of finger paint. If you want your kids to have the joy of smooshing and swirling thick, glossy, colorful paint, avoid this product.update: I wrote two emails to the Alex company, one when I wrote this review and one about 1 month ago. To date, nobody has responded."
2,Should have been much better.,"I knew that it was primarily a book of still photos. However, what I did not know was that the selection of photos would not be that good. There are much better photos out there that have been published elsewhere. Also, none of the photos are identified by the movie title they are from or who is in the photos. Someone could publish a very good photo book on the pink films, identifying the films and the actors but this is not it."
4,Fun compilation. Period.,"This comp combines ska, new wave, punk, R&B and rock songs that walk the fine line between fun and art. Ranging from late sixties to mid eighties, the beginnings of the nineties modern rock scene (less so ""alternative"") are sown. Thank these artists for opening doors for the writers of songs like ""One Week"", ""The New Pollution"", ""Sell Out"", and ""Flagpole Sitta"" - fun, fresh music that, in ten years, will leave you saying ""Those were the daze..."""
5,"Finally, rules for winning in business and in life","Full of real world examples of how anyone with a little innovation, creativity and guts can not only succeed, but also really win in today's business world. It's not enough to play by the rules anymore, you have to think outside the box and not be afraid to take chances. Inspirational and motivating, this book is an easy read and the Snag the Ideas feature is invaluable to any businessperson looking to get ahead quickly."
5,A Valuable Book for the Brand Professional,"Alexi's book addresses crucial issues facing new companies in competitive markets: How do you establish your brand quickly without burning through your cash to buy a lot of potentially useless advertising? How do you motivate employees and make them feel loved without taking the edge off their competitive spirit? How do you inspire your sales force today without sacrificing company profits tomorrow? Some of these questions are truly painful, but Alexi handles them with wit and humor. This is a nice book, by an executive who genuinely cares about the future and respects the past."
4,Dancehall's Finest,"As a member of the younger generation I learn about the Dancehall greats from my parents. This CD was part of the lessons. Tony Rebel and Garnett Silk are masters of the dancehall art. Their songs all good have rhythm and flow well. What makes this CD special is among other things there are lyrics with a purpose. Rebel and Silk have put together songs that you can use to rock a party and at the same time manage to say something. Whether it's educating the youth in Rebel's ""Good Instruction"" or educating their peers in ""Dancehall Principle"", this album is full of track to which you can you can sit and listen or dance and listen with equal ease. Which is better than most music being put out which while admittedly have nice beats don't say much of anything."
4,Hurry Come up!,two of reggea's preeminent artists team up with 100% conscious lyrics and booming dancefloor back beats. the last half of the cd includes dubs/remixes for seven of the preceding cuts which is a nice bonus. if you are a fan of Tony Rebel and or Garnet Silk dont miss this!
3,Fine showing by the Red Garland Trio,This is a fine showing by Red Garland's Trio. The songs are all pretty straight forward (not that there's anything wrong with that) rendentions of ballads and blues. Overall nothing really musically offensive or abrasive takes place however nothing horribly exciting or different takes place either. Paul Chambers is featured pretty heavily and he is in nice form throughout. For that reason fans of Chambers' work will want to check this record out. Fans of Garland's other records are very likely to enjoy this too. Fans of more 'out' or edgy styles will probably not find enough here to keep them excited.
4,Tight Funk,The Bar-Kays have always Been One Of The Baddest Bands.This Set Highlights their Tight Chops&Grooves.Bumpin' Funk For Days.Shake Your Rump To The Funk is a Classic Jam.These Grooves are Still Happening.
4,Good Stuff,The Arabic influenced beats combined with some very good arrangements give this CD a slightly mystical edge counterbalanced with a rock and roll energy.
3,Calming atmosphere background music,Santiago's Dreamthis is a relaxing CD that will help take the edge off of your day or compliment a nice glass of Sauvignon Blanc.
2,Scaramouche the King Maker,Poor. Doesn't hold a candle to the original. Characters seem wooden and puposeless. Especially Aline. In the original she had personality and an edge. In this one she seems bland and banal.Bill Oakey
1,Not what it appears to be,"This Video is actually various hip-hop videos, If you happen to be hip-hop fan great! Otherwise just watch MTV, you won't see much more here."
2,Reader in Seattle,"I began reading Ms. Lurie's collection with her most recent ""The Last Resort"", which I enjoyed. I then decided to read preceding books like ""The Nowhere City"" and then ""Love and Friendship"". Nowhere City wasn't bad, but had pretty much the same characters and circumstances as The Last Resort but just in a different setting. As for Love and Friendship, it has taken me quite awhile to get through the book. I must say that I am happy to see Ms. Lurie grow in her writing but for goodnes sake write about something else than a professor and a wife in a marriage gone bad and extra-marrital affairs. Every book is the same. I would recommend choosing one of her books, particularly the later editions, and not read any others because they aren't any different."
4,Herbal Return,"After the not-too-memorable ""Something Wicked"", The Herbaliser cook an excelent collection of songs in the vein of their ""Very Mercenary"" album. Roots Manuva is excellent, and the female MC spot in this album is taken by Jean Grae, bringing back fond memories of Herbaliser's collaborations with Bahamadia. Great beats, with a nice orchestral sound and a soundtrack-like quality. Great album."
3,"Not bad for beginners, but skips detailed explanations.",The one thing missing is an explanation of why code lines do the things they do. How about explaining Constructors and Main methods.....?
2,Furthering the myth that good programming is easy.,"This book, is definitely not for the experienced programmer. I blazed through the book in one evening, and didn't really learn anything. This book might be great if you've never written a line of code in any language. If you've been programming for years and want to add another language to your resume don't use this book. I spent more time scanning past useless information (I already know what a computer program is), to find the few nuggets of useful information."
1,I have chosen 1 star because there was not negative numbers,"The worst book (always if someone wants call it a book) that I have never been TRYING reading. I bought that ""book"" with my eyes bended after have bought and read the book ""SAMS teach yourself HTML 4 in 24 hours"". That is a great book. But after this OBJECT that you can name PUBLIC WASTE Sams name will leave my mind forever!"
4,"""Prayer of a righteous man avails much""","Prayer on the surface seems a waste of time. But when you consider why our thoughts are even turned toward Christ whom we have never seen, points us to the mystery of God's willingness to confirm in us these truths. Where do these thoughts and drives within us come from? It comes from prayer and thinking on God and his ways. ""The prayer of a righteous man avails much?"" If a father asks God everyday that his daughters and sons love God and considers His ways in all they do, will He not grant him that prayer?This book helped me understand the Catholic culture of someone ""standing"" in place of others in prayer and contemplation. We may very well get to heaven and realise the most important acts of Christianity in history were in Monasteries."
4,Great Read,Convienient and easy to read. Will certainly look forward to more reading material in the future. I cnsider myselkf apart of the Amozon Family of readers.
4,Classic Storey,Kept my wife's interest. I will get around to reading it too. It seems to go on and on was one of my wife's comments.
5,Second Time Around,"I am currently reading this book forthe second time. I searched far and wide and finally found it at theHarvard University bookstore in 1993. It was, and still is, worth the effort. For anyone doubting why they are Catholic or the true depth of their faith, this is a must read. Merton speaks to the heart, soul, and mind as he tells the story of his journey to the Truth. Other great Merton books are ""No Man is an Island"" and ""Thoughts in Solitude"". Don't let the reader from San Francisco dissuade you. If you're looking for philosophy, as this person was, read Plato. If you wish to renew or strengthen your faith, read this book. END"
4,Spiritual revival for lapsed Catholics,"If you feel yourself flagging in your Catholic faith, or if you are considering converting to Catholicism, read this book! I converted a year ago, and this book helped me understand more truths about my faith."
5,Wonderful Spiritual Autobiography,"This book is an excellent introduction to Thomas Merton. It actually reads like a great novel, which makes it even more fascinating that it is an autobiography. Merton is often appreciated for his contemplative works. I would not necessarily consider The Seven Storey Mountain a contemplative book, but it definitely belongs in the canon of Western mystical literature. It can provide a great doorway into deeper and more spiritual works. Topics such as monasticism become absolutely intriguing after reading this book. Be warned that this book could cause you to embark on a great spiritual journey!"
4,Classic,Thomas Merton lived an amazing life. This book takes you through his youth till his adult years. It was an amazing journey to find his faith in God and life as a monk. He has a great skill to walk you through his life in great detail. This is a classic.
5,Seven Story Mountain,"My copy of this got away; so, I ordered another. I've just read Spong's Jesus for the Non-Religious and loved it. He referred several times to Merton so I decided to get into this again. It is ageless. It is spiritual. It's the story of a quest. Your quest. I recommend it highly"
5,Couldn't Ask for More,"Copies were well priced, new, and came amazingly fast.The Seven Storey MountainObviously the Merton story and the quality of his prose are outstanding."
3,a Gift,"I bought this for a friend, they said the author was insightful and that they were enjoying the book. However they had to keep a dictionary on hand to understand what he was saying at times."
3,Kindle Edition Needs proofreading,"The kindle edition is filled with typographical errors. please, publishers, work harder at this. A simple spell check or proofreading would catch many of these. ""1"" for ""I,"" ""thai"" for ""this."" For $9, you should at least proofread your text."
5,A Modern St. Augustine,I purchased the E version of this book to clear out my book shelf. Merton is an example that it is never too late to change.
4,Surprising journey of Faith,"I lived in Kentucky for 10 years, and I heard of Thomas Merton. I was afraid to try to read any of his works as I thought that they would be so deep I wouldn't be able to relate. Thomas Merton has shared with us his journey into Cistercian life that was easy to read, and I found myself not wanting to put it down, and when I finished I found that I wanted to hear more from him. It reminded me of the life of St. Augustine."
3,Puzzled By All The Acclaim,"I am a catholic, and after many years I finally read this book. Frankly, I am disappointed. Were it not for the wonderful introduction by Robert Giroux, the reader would not have learned of Merton's fathering of an illegimate child. Merton does not discuss this in the book. How then can anyone seriously compare this with St. Augustine's Confessions? I wanted to learn about the monks, who they were, where they came from, and why they entered the monastery. Their backgrounds would have been very interesting, but Merton gives us none of this. I found the spiritual passages too simplistic, like my catholic grammar school catechism."
2,"Dull, with moments of brilliance","This book is supposed to be the autobiography of one of Catholicism's great open minds. But Merton's mind is largely closed. Merton bashes nearly everyone in this book, Anglicans, people without faith, protestants of all colors. He does not have a questioning spirit about his own faith, but just parrots some well worn cliches about Roman Catholicism. It seems you must come to Merton loving Merton or you will see nothing here but one man's contempt for others and himself"
2,A Long and Difficult Read,"It has taken me six months to get half way through this book. I am sure it will provide wonderful spiritual insight by the end, but it is really slow reading."
2,Fair at best,"Decent potential for this book, but it really began to drag after awhile. I expected more in depth passages detailing his ultiamte decision and eventual life in the monastary. The book dwells too long on his ""sinful"" lifestyle and not enough on the moments that drew him to Gesthemani."
1,"boring, dead scholasticism ....","This book was a best seller in the fifties-what was all the fuss about? The author comes across as an arrogant, scientifically uneducated mind. Augustine and Blake?! He should have taken the trouble to learn Newton's laws of motion. That was the whole trouble with 'classical education'. It left the resultants incompetent to discuss anything but egocentrism."
3,Many typographical errors in Kindle edition,"The story itself is amazing, inspiring and enlightening. But the many, many errors in the Kindle edition make it frustrating to read. Apparently nobody at Kindle took the time to proof read the ebook version."
5,Seven Storeys is Quite a Story!,"Do you want to know what it is that inspires a person to become a monk? Would you believe that these monks are just ordinary folks like you and me? Find out what happens when a worldly man listens to the still quiet voice calling him home! The only criticism I had with this product is that occasionally some of the words in my downloaded copy (for Kindle) were misspelled. I don't know if it was an artifact of the download or the translation. In any case, it's not a real bother. This book is as exciting as any of the top ten novels you may find today - and it is not a novel - but a story of one man's spiritual journey. A must read for those seeking a deeper spiritual life!"
2,very difficult to use,"i used this textbook in an intro physics course...while it more or less explains basic concepts sufficiently, it is grossly lacking in terms of applying concepts to even the homework problems at the end of each chapter. while i'm not asking to have my hand held through each and every problem, i think this textbook expects students to be able to solve unreasonably difficult problems given the depth in which it covers the material, and the associated lectures."
5,Great laptop for the money,"I'm so pleased with this purchase. It's light, efficient, attractive, and easy to use. And as a side note, despite some criticisms, I find Windows XP intuitive and an easy fit, once I turned off the features I don't use, and that keep popping up on the screen! But all my old programs, with the exception of my printer driver, made the shift without a hitch."
1,Junk,This laptop is a piece of junk. Very little in the way of memory expansion and the hinges are pitiful--I have to prop the screen up against something so it doesn't flop over.
1,strange.....,"I bought this computer(710ca which 710us's canada version) a few days ago in canada. the strange thing is before i buy this laptop, i check from website: compaq.ca that it says that graphic memory is 32mb, but in fact it isn't; it's only 16 mb.make you sure before you buy compaq's laptop in canada."
2,Very powerful suction - but it didn't work on my upholstered couch,"No doubt about it, this unit has powerful suction. But even so, it doesn't pick up any of the cat hair on my upholstered couch, no matter how many times I go over the fabric. Disappointing."
4,easy to use but the sound too loud,"It is very good for the corner and hiding place vacuum, but the blowing function doesn't works well. I mainly used it to clean my computers and slits in my sofa where my kids drop all kinds of food, small toys, different staff and dust. It works very well, but the sound is too loud. If you don't care the loud noise which is a very good product for small area."
2,Lots of suction - cheaply made,"Suction is great. However, it front plastic cover comes off all the time and dirt can come out when the vacuum is off. So you need to empty all the time. This vacuum is very cheaply made. It is also very loud."
5,I love it!,"Great suction! Easy to use, long cord, and big enough space to use repeatedly without having to dispose the filter too often for someone who hates doing really disgusting things like that. In fact, I've had it for over a month and still have not emptied out the vacuum. I like the vacuum cleaner-it was a good deal."
5,Pet hair no match,"This is a corded vacuum that works great on furniture which has a tight weave, the beater brush is made from some type of silicon material that really lifts the dog hair up. Our dog sheds alot and you will need to empty after each use but have used this on stairs and sections of carpet and found it is the best vac for pet hair"
4,Black and Decker Vaccum cleaner,This vaccum cleaner works well. I am satisfied with the product. Its easy to use and sucks in even very small particles.
1,worst product - par for the course for black and decker,"I cannot begin to explain what a complete and total rip off this product is. The pieces won't stay together, the suction is subpar, it falls apart if you look at it. Having experienced Black and Decker ""quality"" before, I should have known that this would be their standard substandard, but other reviews convinced me that maybe B&D; had turned around.They haven't. It's un-usable if you want to use the rotating head. I'm sure if you're just using the handheld part, and don't want the rotor brush, that it picks up crumbs just fine, but as a pet hair vac, it's pointless. It's heavy enough that I bruised the bejebus out of my foot when it fell apart and fell on my foot.It's loud, it's low quality, and a better use of your $30 would be to set it on fire to see the pretty colors. After multiple attempts to fix their design flaws, including duct taping the pieces together, I've just put it in the charity box.Avoid this waste of cash. Seriously."
1,Disapointed,"I just bought this item at Walmart. My intent was to use it for quick daily pickups in between the weekly thorough vacuuming- pulling out my big machine is a drag.I chose it because there are no air vents on the sides as some other hand vacuums which cause dipersion of debris. I have 2 cats which shed their hair on my sofa and armchair. The Retriever was promising as it sounds very powerful, but it did not collect that much hair. You had to ""insist"" and still it would leave hair behind. A favorite spot of my cats is on the top of the back of the sofa which is 3 inch wide, it was next to impossible to collect the mat of hair there. An annoying feature was the ""neck"" of the pet brush which connects to the machine. It is very flexible and if you try to apply pressure, the brush just raises and just skims the sofa lightly. Very fast, 5-10 minutes into the job, the machine starts feeling very hot. I am returning the Retriever tomorrow. It is not saving me time at all."
2,Just OK,I have dog at home and purchase that product just for dogs hair. The turbo brush is just OK. It is not working great. If you push it to hard it stops. So If you need that for hard hair cleaning I would not recommended that. Good luck
2,"Ok, but not great","The machine doesn't hold up well with usage. I've had it for a few months and now it overheats after five minutes and turns itself off- even when the canister has been cleaned out. The attachments worked great the first two months and then one by one stopped working. The vacuum power is so weak with the attachments on that I can barely feel it with my hand.Without the attachments, the vacuum is still pretty powerful, but again it overheats after five minutes. I can't even clean small surfaces without waiting for the machine to cool off and turn itself back on.My cat's hair is pretty rough and tends to get itself entwined in fabrics making it really hard to clean up. The spinning carpet attachment did a pretty decent job getting the cat hair off my couch- until it stopped working."
4,Works wonders for shedding cat hair,"I bought this product because I recently got a new cat that loves to shed all over the place, especially my bed comforter. I've used the rubber brushes that brush the hair into piles so they can be picked up but they only worked marginally at best. I needed something with a little more power and I found it. While it is annoying that this devices isn't cordless, there is no way that it would work as well as it does if it were. As soon as I got it I put it to the test and it passed with flying colors. It took a few passes with the pet hair attachment, but once I figured out the trick to using it, it cleaned up my comforter in no time. Even just using it around my apartment, to clean up the cat liter mess, it worked wonderfully. I would definitely recommend this to anyone that has a small pet that has shed a lot of hair on furniture because the pet attachment works great."
1,Bad suction,This vacuum overheats after five minutes and turns itself off. It picks up pretty much nothing. Loud and heavy useless junk.
3,A Little Disappointed,I ordered it based on the good reviews. It sucks well but really noisy. I wanted a corded one since those chargable doesn't last long enogh for the jobs I need it for. But the cord is much shorter than the one I had before. I had return it.
4,B&D Corded Handheld Vac. HV9010P,I love this thing. We have a Golden Retriever. Nuff said there. Would have given it a five star tribute but it ain't as good as my favorite indoor sport!!!
3,Not for me.. Its corded!!!,"I guess I didn't read correctly when I was at Walmart and bought this thing. I didn't read that it is NOT cordless. When I got home I pluggged it in and immediately noticed it is very loud and probably powerful. When I realized the cord didn't come out, I decided that I would be taking it back. I'm not into the whole old fashioned thing. The only corded vacuum I want or need are my beloved Dyson's. I'm going to get another Black and Decker CORDLESS."
4,Thrilled with HV9010P Pet hair pickup,"The Black&Decker;Black & Decker HV9010P Retriever Pet-Series Cyclonic-Action Corded Dustbuster and BlowerPet-Series Dustbuster works terrific on pet hair in the dog beds. It is lightweight but sturdy, right power for hair, filter easy to access and empty, plenty long cord, and it picks up hair with one pass.Noisy enough to scare the dogs.It sells on Amazon for about $30 &I; get no commission. :-)"
3,Works well... cord gets in the way...,"Very powerful hand vac that really does it's job getting the hair off of the furniture and curtains... however the cord is a bit of a hassle and gets in my way (even though it's long, I'm a little clumsy). One of the attachments broke and I can't seem to find it's replacement so now it's just a hand vac, which defeats it's purpose."
2,poorly designed brush assembly,"wish I had not bought this. The actual vacuum is fine, very strong, but the attachment is very poorly designed. The brush spins by suction and is easily stopped. the whole brush assembly completely fell apart the first time I dropped it, which is easy to do because of the awkward two-hand approach needed to use it."
5,Wonderfully powerful and holds up well,When I initially purchased this I did not notice that it was not battery powered. The quality of it in its power and the long power cord easily make up for this. This replaced a desire to have a shop vac around as it does such an amazing job.
2,doesn't suck,"It doesn't do a good job sucking up the cat litter from the carpet or the cat hair. If I'm patient with it, and keep trying, the motor gets too hot and shuts down. Very very disappointing item.It's easy to change attachments/empty the receptacle and the filter works well."
4,Anybody Else Puzzled By Filter?,"Okay, I received this vacuum about an hour ago. Everything checks out fine EXCEPT for a question on the filter. Everywhere you look (even the box and instruction manual) refers to the HVF-91 washable cloth filter, but when I opened up the filter compartment what was inside was the fluted paper cone filter which seemed identical to the VF100 paper filter used in the cordless Dustbuster! Anyone else experience this?(After I posted the above I noticed a picture of the filter on the side of the box the vacuum came in. Guess what? It's a picture of the paper VF100 filter (the one that's in the vacuum), not the recommended HVF-91 cloth filter!!! Go figure. I'm just going to make the assumption that you can use either filter.)"
3,for the dustbunnies and dirt on hardwood floors,"Mainly got this to help me after I swept my hardwood floors. The dustpan just can't get all the stuff off the floor and having a little vac to do the pickup work is what I needed. After reading the reviews of the various cordless types, and not being impressed, I went for the corded. It really has crazy suction power on the main unit, HOWEVER, the hard plastic edges were not going to be good for my new hardwood floors. So, rather than hassle returning the thing, my husband took some self-stick felt padding, cut a couple of thin strips and stuck it on the top edge of the intake opening. It can still accomodate the little hose attachment, but now it won't scratch my floors. I know there are other brands/models that have rubber on the edges, and had I paid more attention, I would have gotten one of those. But I think this will do the job."
1,Deficient,"This vacuum comes with no attachments except the brush for pet hair, which is useless for getting into corners and crevices, and I can't seem to find any additional attachments I can get for it. If you just want to clean up dust and pet hair in open discreet areas, it works OK, but for anything more, look elsewhere. Mine's going back to Amazon."
2,Shop Around,"We purchased this hand-held to pick up dog fur and also to get dust off of our dogs fur. The suction is definitely not up to par. I'd compare the suction to one of those inexpensive,unknown name brand vac's you buy at K-mart or some other retailer for 19.95 or less. For a small hand held it is extremely loud and does heat up quickly. This machine is overpriced and I expected much better from Black & Decker. I would definitely shop around for a higher quality hand-held and only buy this unit if it is a last resort. It failed miserably when used to suck up dog fur from a futon mattress, a leather recliner chair. By the way, this unit absolutely will not pick up dust from a computer/keyboard, nor should it be used as such (i.e. as a data vac)."
3,"Very Powerful, not on hair.","This is powerful, however it does not pick up hair very well. It has a decent cord, and is great for stairs."
3,Not as good as I hoped,I have 6 cats so you can imagined the hair I have floating around. After reading reviews on various websites it seemed like a good tool. It works ok but does not get all the hair out of my carpets. Easy to clean but my large vacuum works much better. It is fine for light duty work but don't expect miracles!
2,"Powerful, but the brush head is weak!","I loved this little vacuum, but had to replace the brush head twice, and it still didn't last. Very disappointed. : ("
3,great for steps,I think the suckion can be better but works good on my steps. It is ok for curtains but anything more like a sofa get something with more suction power if you are looking to get rid of pet hair this is not the one.............
4,very pleased with product!,"I couldn't find this product in local stores so purchased online. I did my homework and checked out many reviews and decided to go with this Black and Decker model. Its easy to use, clean and store. It picked up the very fine dust created by african grey parrot, as well as feathers.I also liked the feature that allows the unit to blow air. I use this to clean my air filtering units and to blow dust on fridge coils."
2,Not as good as I had hoped,I purchased this corded handheld vacumn because another brand unit my wife had had for many years finally wore out. This unit has proved to be a disapointment because of the egeronomics of it. this actual brush/cleaning head is so far from the handle that it puts a large amount of stress on your wrist and tires you out quickly. Also the dirt collection chamger is awkward to open and close and too small so it needs to be emptied often. It does clean but with so many problem I cannot recommend it to others.
4,Works as intended,"As a hand vac with attachments it seems to do a great job. It doesn't replace a full size vac, but for reaching small areas, and getting up pet hair, it's ideal."
3,Ok power but not enough for car vacuuming,"I'm not sorry that I purchased the vacuum but it does have it's limitations. When I tried to vacuum the floor of my car it wouldn't pick up even the tiniest pebbles or bits of gravel. It worked fine on the seats but it got hot after a while and turned itself off for about 20 minutes! I was sure that it was ruined but after 20 minutes it worked fine again. It worked great in the house on dust in those hard to vacuum areas like under the desk & behind the TV. Also worked great on shredded paper on the floor by the shredder. I'll enjoy having it for such things but I'll still be dragging out the 20 year old shop vac for the car. Oh, the special retriever head kept falling apart in my hands (not put together right at the factory). I had to figure out how to put the tiny belt on and snap it back together myself. Not the end of the world but when you take something like that out of the box you expect it to work."
3,Great suction but...,"This little machine has great suction but is limited in flexibility - hard-to-reach areas are difficult. The attachments are so-so. The brush barely picks up at all. The flat tool has great suction but could have a wider surface area. Still, it will go where your big vac won't and it's not too heavy."
2,unhappy with black and decker!,black and decker hand vac we got for picking updog hair is not worth 29.99.Maybe 15.99 at themost.The attchments donot work at all! But theone thing I give it credit for is the suction!Thats great!
3,Pet Hair Removal,"My husband bought me the Dirt Devil PURPOSE for pets. We have white furniture, with 2 black cats, and 1 grey cat. The product lost it's ""awesomeness"" after a few uses. I went to Walmart to return it, and look for the next best thing. This was it. GREAT price. I LOVE that it's handheld/compact. I LOVE how long the cord is. The rubber electrostatic bristles are AWESOME at scraping up the cat hair that I can't get up with manual hair brushes. The only thing that concerns me is the pivit feature. The attachment just dangles there like a limp hand. I can't seem to figure out why. I think it would be much better if the attachment was stiff so I could get into the nitty gritty in the couch. Also, it leaves a weird pattern on my couch, not nothing that can't be fixed with a once over with the hand. A small price to pay for a handheld that gets the cat hair off my couch."
3,Front attachment moves unnecessarily while vacuuming,"I noticed the following problem.The attachment (the front piece which contains rotating brush) that fixes to the handheld moves up and down while vacuuming a flat surface. It does not get fixed tightly. Therefore while vacuuming I had to make extra effort to keep this front part pressed against the floor while moving vacuum back and forth. I was vacuuming the stairs.Note:- The vacuum works as expected, however this is an annoying problem."
5,It's nice to see kids learning while they play,We had a great time playing the Light `N' Strike Math game. My daughter is allowed to use a calculator in school and I often worry about how well she really knows her math facts. She did a great job and I could tell after she played for a while it was becoming easier for her. There were facts that I couldn't remember at all (it's been a while since I've been in school) and it did become easier after I had seen them on the game a few times. Charlee Ann (my youngest at 1 1/2 years) really liked the flashing lights and was quick to grab the game off the table (this is not recommended but it did happen) and she decided that the way you played the game was to throw it across the room. The game held up without a scratch and we learned to put the game up and out of her reach. One thing that was a little nerve racking was when you had to wait for a number to light up to get the answer. I wanted instant gratification when I knew the right answer!!
1,Confusing toy for my child,"The idea behind this learning toy is great. However, the way it works can be very confusing and frustrating for a child. The toy presents a math equation to be solved (e.g. 2+2), then you have to WAIT until the button representing the answer lights up (e.g. 4). The toy will light the numbered buttons randomly one at a time. If you hit the button corresponding to the correct answer prior to the button lighting up, then the toy tells you that you got the answer wrong - it just flashes ""WRONG"" ""WRONG""... It's confusing because my child wasn't sure whether he got the answer wrong was because he did the math wrong or because he didn't get the timing right of hitting the button. For simple addition and subtraction, our objective is speed - hit the answer as soon as you figure out the answer. I'm not convinced there's much benefit in waiting for the right button to light up."
2,Broke after using twice and amazon won't help me,"When this toy worked, my 6 year old son loved it. I agree with the other reviewers that it would be easier and more fun if the kids didn't have to wait for the correct answer, but once he got the hang of it, my son did not seem to care. However, after using a couple of times it is not working. I thought it was the batteries, changed those but it is just broken. There is nothing obvious to show why (evidence of the kids being too rough with it). I first called Learning Resources and they wouldn't help me because it was bought off of Amazon. [...]Personally,I think thats a little rude. My other option is throwing the toy in the trash."
1,Disappointing!,"We are working to make math fun for our son (7 years old, 2nd grade), and this only frustrated him.When you know the answer, you have wait for the button with the right answer to light up. For instance, if the answer is ""2"" you may have to wait for 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 0 to light up before the 2 lights up. That is very frustrating for a kid who knows the answer and wants to move onto the next question.I'd skip it."
3,Dissapointed too,"My kids got bored waiting for numbers to light up. I wouldn't buy this if you want your kids to master their speed. It's fine for my 5 year old, but he likes the math mat better."
3,"My son liked it, but I preferred Math Shark","We bought both Light 'n' Strike Math and Math Shark for my 9-year old nephew and had my son try out both games. After you choose the level and type of math (add, subtract, divide or multiply) the Light 'n' Strike asks you a series of math questions. In order to score, you need to hit the numbers of the correct answer just as they are lit up and then hit enter. There isn't a set time limit so if you're trying to get your kid to memorize math facts as quickly as possible, this is not the educational toy for you. However, the Light 'n' Strike is a fun way for kids to work on math skills while improving on their hand-eye coordination."
1,WRONG,"Great idea, horrid product.Kids have to push or hit the answer when the number is illuminated. But the correct number may never be illuminated. Then your kid gets a ""WRONG"". I watched this happen numerous times including twice in a row. Likewise, it may go on so long before the right answer is illuminated that it is boring.The levels progress way to rapidly. In Level 1 addition, it mixes one and two digit answers. So you get 0+1 and then 9+9 in the same grouping. Then when you move up to level 2 addition, it start asking things like what is 78 + ? = 82.Finally, this is a fragile toy even though it is supposed to be struck."
2,Disappointed,I do not like this. Bought for my 8 year old to practice math facts and she does not like it either. You have to wait for the number to light up before you can hit the answer and move on. There is way too much time to sit and wait and wait and then wait more. A kids attention span is just not long enough. This will not improve speed or provide fun. It appears to be well built and sound is good quality.
2,Took forever,The sign itself was great but forget about the 10 days they say it take to get it. I ordered this December 3rd for a Christmas gift and it arrived on January 2nd. I hate giving I.O.U.s as a gift. The only reason I don't give this a 1 star is the sign itself was pretty cool.
3,Winning at New Products,"could give more details regarding why it's not a perfect item. eg: highlighting in the book, etc."
2,Older version,"There is a newer version, the website did not have it available or mentioned, imagine the surprise when I started school and my classmates books look different, missing a couple of chapters."
4,A great primer on Product/Project Management,"An excellent job of Stage-Gates. This book represents one of the best overviews of this process. Where requirements are key, and any set of tasks, as well as the whole project, can best be observed and understood using this method. The key in having a successful project/product is first understanding the requirements and constraints. This book is excellent in this area and a great first step in the understanding required to implement great programs."
2,"Neither here, nor there","The book reads like a graduate student paper, very heavy on citation of the theories in technology management, very light on original research. A typical statement in the book would be ""this theory, backed by our extensive research)"" proceeding to just quote the original theory. The book does not provide any eye-openers about winning in today's marketplace, but rather summarizes existing theories, like stage gate, house of quality, development funnel, etc.. It lacks the depth in any particular subject, and perhaps could be a good overview for somebody, just not sure who."
3,Not Pre-Oiled,"I don't remember if the description said anything about oil when i bought the product, but buyers FYI, you'll need to buy filter oil as well. The foam ships dry and doesn't contain an oil packet. Purchase separately. Otherwise, the part fits fine."
1,Another wanna-be Alpha Dog,"This guy is all about dominance and trying to be the alpha dog. He has total disregard for postitive training techniques, or clicker training. Even though these techniques have been proven to work. He is over-the-top with the whole alpha dog concept -- another out-dated, unproven theory from the 1940s. In fact, I tried to find a lot of the data supporting these so-called alpha dogs studies, and could not find any reasonable research. But I found this great link that dispels them:http://www.mnforsustain.org/wolf_mech_dominance_alpha_status.htm"
3,Somewhat Repetitive,"I have always liked the relaxed style of Paul Q, especially his ""For Basie"" album but in this CD he keeps regurgitating stock phrases and after a while it becomes a bit boring. There are better PQ CDs out there."
4,Rudolph Wurlitzer writes an American Classic,"After being badgered by the Casa Marina Reading Club in the late '70's to read this (resulting in my subsequent slide into Nog-like obscurity), I can state with some experience that this book exerts an influence on its readers. Rumors abound that Wurlitzer was an itinerant goat herder who strived to simplify his life: to date these rumors are unsubstantiated. However, there is evidence that ""Nog"" is an influence in the writings of Thomas Pynchon and Christopher Moore. Chuck Norris has been known to quote significant passages from the book in some of his Westerns and credits the book with his zen-like approach to martial arts. A good read - and a way of life."
3,Need more product information,How big are these cards? Do they come with bingo disks of any sort? It's a pity the manufacturer doesn't give more information about this product.
3,Need better description of Bingo Cards,I am searching for Bingo cards with the sliding window to cover the number. Are these cards that kind?
5,Great Cards!,Purchased these bingo cards for a family reunion of 50 people - they are extremely durable and worked really well! Excellent product.
3,"A big ""little Russian"" symphony","Still have not heard a live performance yet. I was first alerted to its qualities by another recording. This one is technically quite good. Very little compression of dynamics is present. Sound is wide, deep and tall and represents the hall well. Pace is good although at times there may be a lack of energy. The brass section is well represented throughout the work as is the strings section. Occasionally bass line is a bit shy as is percussion.Overall it is ok but I think Mr Jenner did a better job in the other recording with Maestro Abbado and CSO."
3,Maazel yes...maazel no,The Horn sounds great in the Tschiakowsky. (p.s. It's me)The March in the Antar is way too slow.The PSO at this time was playing very well and is worth hearing in spite of Maazel!
3,Not my favourite Miss Silver mystery.,"This wasn't the best Miss Silver mystery that I've read. First of all we hardly see Miss Silver at all, and she isn't the one who actually solves this case. A lot of the action takes place without her presence. Since I read Miss Silver to see her sharp mind in action, that was a disappointment. Also, the mystery wasn't too hard to figure out, so maybe they didn't need Miss Silver's razor-sharp intelligence for this one. It starts with a village woman seeing a man dragging what was obviously a dead woman's body in the night, but there was no body to find afterwards, so no one really believed her until she turns up dead too. Frank and Miss Silver set out to find the first woman's body. As in all Miss Silver books there is a love interest, but this has a bit of a twist since it involves a separated married couple. A bit disappointing, this one."
3,"pretty good, but still looking for something better","This product certainly helps clean up your cables but is not a complete cable management solution if that's what you're looking for. I have a desk where the back is fully exposed showing every single cable going to my computer, lamp, monitor, etc. This is great for guiding all your loose cables under the desk but I'm still faced with the issue of how I could hide all the excess! I usually loop them and zip tie them but then it just looks like a bunch of power cords hanging in my workshop. Messy! The best I've seen so far is the ""Galant"" cable management product from Ikea. Using Galant with these cord clips is the best combo, however the tackiness should be improved on the self-adhesive backing. I've noticed a few have already detached from my desk."
3,Probably the most original of Cartoon Gore Flix !,"TERROR TOONS 2terrortoons2.comStarring Brinke Stevens,Jeff Dylan Graham,Jed Rowen ,Ken Hall and Eric Spudic.Written and directed By JOE CASTROThis film is really good.You know ,Its so rare to see ORIGINAL, Terror Toons 2 is that that simply put.I see tributes to Twilight Zone and Joe Dante and Peter Jackson.(c). What some wont get is the Danny Elfman, Oingo Boingo pastiche...Its reeking of Reel Love.How in the world ,Joe Castro came up with this beats me...So far I think he hates Birthdays,Clowns and Hansel and Gretel...WTF ?The animation,sets,and GORE were right on and worthy of awards.I did hate that you cant get attached to any characters that are good,Because they are leaving with some un-wanted mayhem bestowed on `em.Tons of extras,great poster art for cover,This film is starting to get a well deserved cult following on Myspace."
2,A teens review on the book Is That You Miss. Blue?,"Is That You Miss. Blue? is a mediocre book about a young girl named Flanders Brown. After her mother runs off with another man, her father doesn't quite know what to do with his daughter. He decides to send her off to a boarding school in Virginia called Charles School. Flanders is nervous and excited, but doesn't know how she will fit in. She meets her first friend, Carolyn Cardmaker (who only responds if you call her by her last name) on the train ride there.Because Flanders has asthma, she requests a private room away from the regular dorms. Her room is on a vacent hallway with the exception of her two roomates. Angus, is a beautiful, rich, rebelious girl, but she is also deaf and quite loud. And her other roomate is Miss. Blue, who is a biology teacher and calls Jesus her ""pal.""Her stay at Charles is filled with the usual teenage problems and how she tries to rebuild her family's relationships."
2,Disrespectful towards Christianity,"This book seems fairly superficial and is taken up with a lot of gossip and disrespectful attitudes. A few of the girls form an atheist club and try to persuade others that there is no God, even though they are going to an Episcopal boarding school. There isn't even much depth of feeling to make it something to relate to."
1,Renaissance ruined the game,Ultima Online Renaissance ruined the original games potential to be a very good multiplayer game. Its no longer worth the time or money to play.
1,If you want to feel like your workday never ends buy this,"UO, in any of its online forms, is not an Role-Playing experience...it's a second job. People new to this game may get the idea that it is a seamless multiplayer environment producing adventure, fun, and numerous interactions with other players--nothing could be further from the truth. The new player will likely see this ""game"" as a second job. One in which they log onto from 10 to 40 hours a week, to make clothes, bake bread, and build chairs. Then they take the proceeds buy equipment and adventure for one hour. Whereupon they usually lag on the system, their characters freezing. Only to be finally hacked apart by a pig or a cow. For this wonderful exercise, they get to pay the creators of UO a monthly service charge. Don't make the investment. Don't play this game"
2,Only accommodates toothbrushes with small bases,"The holder itself was OK, but it would not hold oral B toothbrushes because the holes drilled were not wide enough. The base stained my counter when wet. Should have been rubber instead of felt."
2,Good Unit till had to take in for Service!!!!,"Bought this Item a year ago, ran good through most of winter off grid then started to not start in cold, then had to be warmer and warmer to start, then at 70F would not start till sprayed with starting fluid. Looked for a service center to service it and find problem called 800 number with a list of locations took it to Kingman, Az they said they don't do propane and could not provide me a place to recommend just caLL NUMBER AGAIN!!! No real person to talk to Got fed up and tore into it replaced head gasket and all gaskets on out and had to adjust the valves now running again except for needing selenoid and now a starter, So word to the Wise, YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN IF YOU BUY IT!!! SO BUYER BEWARE!!!!"
4,Pretty good but get the better one,"I bought this for my parents who had three outages in two years. It was installed professionally and has already powered them through another outage. It also powered everything in their house except the air conditioning condensers and the electric stove/oven. That is the good news.The not so good news is that this unit cannot be installed with an automatic transfer switch. That is a switch that automatically senses a power outage, turns itself on and then switches over to backup power. This unit uses a manual switch which requires someone to go to the unit, turn it on, and then go to the transfer switch and flip a switch. Not horrible but not the best if you can buy the better unit and automatic switch.My parents are very pleased that they had the unit and someone came over to switch it on for them."
4,Extended Long-Play Club Versions,This review applies to CD number 314 520 359-2.Note that these tracks are extended long-play club versions.
2,Needs updating,This compilation of old articles from HBR is somewhat disjointed and definitely out-of-date. The book is not much more than a blatant attempt to trade on the HBR name at the expense of the consumer.
4,HBR on Entrepreneurship is a good welcome guide for young entrepreneurs,HBR on Entrepreneurship is a recommended reading for people who would like to be entrepreneurs. It teaches the basics and provides tricks on how to go about being an entrepreneur and establishing a new company. It was very useful for my Entrepreneurship course at Robert Kennedy College.
4,Good overview of entrepreneurship,This book is helpful as a starting point in the world of entrepreneurship. You will find it provocative and thoughtful and will force you to re-think your goals for your new venture.
4,Simply easy to read with many examples,"If you are looking to become an entrepreneur, or if you are are one, I recommend you read this book."
1,Religious book,"This is a religious book. It offers no useful suggestions on how to overcome anxiety. It is basically a ""trust in the lord, and you will overcome this."" Not helpful, if you're not particularly religious."
4,"A good fantasy novel, with a twist","I came across this book mainly for the cover art, but soon discovered the full series was an excellent read. I recommend this series for any one who is tired of the same old fantasy books that you come across everyday. Silke manages to take characters and make you really interested in them and what happens to them. Definately read if you like fantasy but want something a little different!!!!"
5,The best since Conan.,"This is by far the best epic fantasy I have read since reading Conan thirty years ago. It has everything: It's full of what you'd expect from the old style sword and sorcery novels. It is written well enough to be up there with the best of them, and kept me hooked from beginning to end. After finishing Prisoner of the Horned Helmet, I bought the rest of the books in the series and have never looked back. I envy people with the talent that James Silke has."
1,"VERY sadly, disapointed.","I was sort-of angry when i recieved this in the mail. The bristles are ALOT shorter than in the picture, they are about a centimeter long! what?! Yeah. well, the hairs/bristles kept falling out like CRAZZY, so i thought id wash it a bit to get all the loose hairs out. NO! It didnt work much. And i dont know if it was just my brush, but there was a TERRIBLE smell coming from it after it was perfectly clean and dry! It gave me a head-ache! it was so strange i couldnt beleive it! well, i didnt want to waste my money by not using it, so i just thought id put it in a seperate bag inside my grooming bag, it didnt work. it stenched up my WHOLE bag and spred the smell on my horse?! dissapointed.........im throwing it away or donating it to someone. but i dont know who would want it... I WAS SUPRISED! I LOOOOOOVE OSTER! Everything else from their brand is my absoloute FAVORITE!!! this brush confuses me...."
1,New and brush coming out!,"The product is new and never used, but the brush is coming out when I just pass on my hands, I do not beleive it will have a good durability!"
1,Sorry they took away the version with iron,this pill has reduced vitamins and has these othe holistic items instead. Just give the regular Stresstab w iron any day.
3,Mislabeled!!!,"Picture and description do not match. Shipper has mis labeled. I ordered according to wording ""stress tabs ENERGY"" but I received "" stress tabs WEIGHT""Shipper has wrong label and sku. Will probably happen again. Order this if you want weight version."
3,THE GOOD WIFE,"O'Nan surely has a talent for making time fly. There are a few very important messages in his book. Don't drink. One small mistake can effect the lives of many in a big way.Patty is most definitely a hero. It is amazing what true love will propel one to do.I did not feel as if this book was a page turner, but I felt compelled to follow Patty and find out what her future would bring."
2,nothing learned,"I was very frustrated by this book. Nothing happened, except time passing. The characters aged but did not grow. There was no reflection on the crime committed, or Tommy's motives, or the good wife's ignorance, and no discussion of how the son was affected by his father's imprisonment. Very disappointing."
3,Slow & somewhat disappointing,"There were parts of this book that I liked, but overall, I thought it was slow going. I really didn't like any of the characters very much & didn't think that ""the good wife"" deserved any kudos for sticking by her loser of a husband for over 25 years."
3,The Good Wife,A little disappointed with the story. I thought the wife would divorce and start a new life. Show how a woman can get on with her life and leave the past behind. Why suffer and spend twenty years waiting for him.
2,One of the worst books I read in a long time ...,"It started out good and the excerpt on the front cover was certainly catchy which made me pick it up in the first place. But after Tommy's imprisonment the story slowed down so much it came almost to a screeching halt. I could not identify with Patty or the rest of her family at all. I am a military spouse who has had to live through year-long deployments twice getting ready to face another one but Patty and I still never clicked. Sorry, but I would not recommend this book."
3,The Good Wife,"The ""Good"" wife is anything but good. She is manipulative and cold, Actually she is a a high class prostitute. She has prostituted herself for what she feels is due her. Her older lover, who is in a position to ""take care"" of her, is also flawed psychologically. He is capable of acts of demonic meanness, so in actuality, they deserve each other. How they resove their problems, and bring their relationship to fruition is the true horror of this book. What good can come of it?! You decide!"
2,Good Writing & Idea - Unlikeable Characters,"The idea of this book was better than its reality. I really enjoyed the author's writing style, so for that alone it gets two stars. However, the lead character, Tommy, is so patently unlikeable and uninteresting, it's hard to fathom his wife waiting idly by for 25 years for him to get out of prison. She is blindly devoted, never really asking the questions most people would, especially about the night in question (and Tommy's history of repetitive burglary). The ending is unrealistic and sugary sweet, so that doesn't really fit after a fairly realistic, depressing rendition of Patty's day to day existence. Overall, I cannot recommend it."
5,sad and engaging,"this book is very sad. it tells the tale of one woman's courage to live and stay strong in the worst of situations. Stewart's narration is convincing and realistic. He really gets the reader inside of Patty's head as she endures years and years of hardship, while clinging on to the only thing worth clinging onto: love. YOu will find yourself both crying and smiling and unable to put it down. It is depressing, but highlighted with Patty's small victories such as successfully raising her son and moving herself up in the working world. Patty has it tough and her determination should attract even the most obscure of readers. It is a tale of love lost and it will break your heart over and over again."
1,I feel like I ran a marathon,"Endurance is the game for this novel. While I appreciate the concept, and I admire O'Nan's writing style, this would have read much better as a short story. After reading it I felt like I had spent 20+ years in prison. Perhaps that was the point."
2,Spare novel with little to recommend it,"The spare quality of the novel is a good thing.It's simple and straight-forward, focused completely within the mindset of the ""Good Wife"".Her single-minded focus on the day her husband will hopefully be paroled is the what drives her every action and thought.The goal becomes the important thing. Holding things together until he returns.This could be seen as a weakness, for both the protaganist of the novel and to the reader of the novel.The reader gets no insight into how any of the other characters thinks or feels except through whatever the ""Good Wife"" herself gleans or discovers.It's an interesting read that will allow the reader to think and imagine.But the inherent weakness of focusing only on her limited viewpoint renders this novel an interesting writing exercise that will ultimately give no satisfaction to the reader."
5,Makes you think,"Reading this book is very enlighting. The medical community is coming around to the authors way of thinking. Apple cider vinager is such a staple of life. It has come full circle from the writting of this book to now. It makes me stop and think how simple his suggestions are in comparasion to what todays doctors expect you to do and pills to take. If you are at all interested in apple cider vinager and it's benefits, then this book is well worth it."
4,Great,common sense for all. makes simple sense for all readers and will explain in a format that can be understood
4,Folk Medicine,This book has interesting facts. I will try the recommendations for a couple of the ailments. Nice to have old remedies to refer to.
3,FOLK MEDICINE,I bought this old book for my personal gardening and naturopathy library for reference.It is a good basic book and good history inside.
2,Disappointed in condition,"This was a replacement for a copy which was lent & never returned. It's a very interesting book, worth reading. However I was very disappointed in this used copy. It was supposed to be in good condition, but it is very yellowed and falling apart. Normally I've been very satisfied when buying used copies."
4,Many nuances explained,"O'Reilly books are traditionally written for an experienced computing audience. For the most part, the publisher has eshewed going after a mass market. This book is a little different from the usual fare. It is certainly aimed at experienced IT personnel. But it is in a context where they are now laymen.The author gives a careful exposition of the many legal niceties surrounding open source licensing. He tries to convey nuances that are implied by the generous amounts of boilerplate quoted from common licensing schemes like GPL. Frankly, you may have to force yourself to concentrate and plow through the text. Unless your expertise is patent and copyright law, the book is not the easiest reading. No fault of the author. And the issues he discusses can certainly impact your company's code development.The book is probably most suitable for an IT manager."
4,Not at all as dry as I thought it would be,"I honestly didn't think I'd find this as interesting as I did. As important as licenses are, an annotated listing of them didn't sound like anything I wanted to flop back on the couch with. However, the author has managed to make this both interesting and educational.It covers all the common open source licenses, explaining what each section means, and digging into problems that might come up for the licensor or licensee. Open Source isn't all that it covers: standard shrink-wrap licenses are examined, as is Sun's Community Source License and Microsoft's ""Shared Source Initiative"".Finally, the book itself is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivs license. It is interesting that O'Reilly is willing to publish works like this, but I'm glad they are."
3,Good Source of Information on a Confusing Topic,I actually read this book about a year ago and forgot to do a review. It is helpful and explains what for me is a confusing topic in clear concise language. I find myself going back to it again and again. Particularly useful for those trying to figure out a way to make a business from open source software.
2,Just a copy of the licenses with annotations,"Most of this book is just a copy of the commonly used licenses with paragraph-by-paragraph annotations. There is very little sense of the big picture here, and while the details are important, they're ultimately just confusing without some notion of where the different licenses are coming from and what they are meant to be about. The comments themselves are good, but that just isn't enough."
2,those were the days...,I got this DVD simply because my wife and I watched it many years ago when we were just married. For laughs it is worth the spend but I think I have matured and would rather get a better buy such as Close Encounters..
3,B-movie classic,"The plot is pretty standard. ""Geek"" is asked to help his (gorgeous) substitute biology teacher with an experiment. All of the sudden ""geek"" gets cool and has amazing...self-confidence...at least partially due to the pheremones put out by the thing poking out of his head. Turns out the substitute is an alien out to save her race by experimenting on hapless humans.So can our geek ever get the one girl he wants, instead of the hundreds he doesn't? Get the show and find out."
2,Nothing like I expected...,"I couldn't wait to get ahold of this book after so many rave reviews. I didn't find the recipes all that appetizing (their other book CRAZY PLATES was better in this regard), the recipe titles were confusing, and I found the comics mostly annoying."
2,Too Often Confusing,"There are some tasty recipes in this book, but the names of them are each trying so hard to be funny that you can't always tell what the recipe is for and there are no ""sub-titles"" to tell. Examples of recipes include: ""A Penne Yearned"", ""A Curried Affair"", ""All in the Yamily"", ""La Rice-a Bon-eata"", ""We're Talking Small Potatoes"", and so forth. It's impossible to tell what the dish is, much less whether it's a main dish, side, or dessert. For that reason, I don't use the book very often and wish I had spent my money on something else."
5,Outstanding! Everyone should have this book.,Incredible book - really fun and creative. Something for everyone. It's a must-have. I'd love to have dinner with these ladies.
3,The Spirit of NLP was written by L. Michael Hall!,"Having said that, I still think that this is somewhat of an important book, it was the first NLP book I saw which openly commented on how Richard Bandler uses tone and Rythm to build propulsion into his presentation. Knowing this helped imeasurably once I started listeniing to him on tape. Having said all this, obviously this is not a beginners book on NLP, so if you're not prepared to wade through terminology than you will be very frustrated by this book."
5,Essential - if you want to go beyond Practitioners,"This book is aptly named! It does, indeed, cover the Spirit of NLP. A book recommended for people who have completed their Practitioner's course, or equivalent. Michael Hall's style is emerging as one of the best, particularly as a ""late"" entrant into the scene. He has a total perspective and broad vision, which is conveyed. It is also evident that he is a thinker, and is concerned with putting his ideas across in such a way that he could predict the response! A lot of information here, which also gives us the insight and invitation to understanding. Easy to read, well thought out and laid out. An author to search for - and follow."
1,This book si not for Vampire the Masquerade.,"Ok the V:tM book Time of the Thin Blood had Dhampirs in it. They are the living offspring of a 15th generation vampire and a mortal and had some unusual powers. They seemed interesting but there was barely enough information to use them as an NPC so I eagerly ordered this book off amazon when it first popped up back in March. I got it today and well I'm sending it back because it isn't for Vampire the Masquerade at all. It is for Kindred of the East. Apparently, Kindred of the East (which is a seperate game made by the same company) can have offspring with a mortal and are also called Dhampirs and well these are the Dhampirs that this book is about. I searched the book high and low to find something that purtains to V:tM and I didn't find a thing. It says it is a sourcebook for V:tM and KotE but it is for KotE all the way. Just thought I would tell you."
4,glyph for starters,An exellent document as it decodes the Phaistos Disk. This is one of three of the latests interpretations. The interest in this book will target only those who have visited Greece.
3,High-Tech Heretic review,"High-Tech Heretic is based on the question the runs through everyone's head; should computers be in the classroom? There are some circumstances that computers should be used in the classrooms. Like typing a paper on Microsoft or graphing statistics on Microsoft excel, but not for math. We use computers in math for test and quizzes and many people do not like it. Some people can not learn their mistakes from a computer. They have to learn step by step and see it in front of them. Many people also can not afford computers and basing their assignments on computers is harder for the students who do not own one. This book is a good book to read and have a debate on whether classrooms should have computers or not and the point is many people have different views on it, but most likely there will be computers in the classroom."
3,High tech Heretic Review,"Stoll's view that technology and the computer has a negative impact on education could be considered radical. Today most schools around the country have computers, either a computer lab or compouters in a library or even inside the classroom. However, most people would agree with the statement that the money spent on fixing computers should go towards classroom materials. Also some parents would agree that the computers could potentially take away from the instructional time by programming the software or explaining how to use the software. Despite those concerns computers and technology are rapidlly growing every year. Children have to be aware of computers and the new technology if they wish to be sucessful in the future. If society did what Stoll suggests, that people should go back to the time when telephone and TV were first invented, then more then likely people would not know what to do. Technology has become a part of everyday living for most."
3,So-So,"I was grateful to see some hesitation toward using a computer in the classroom. In my math class I include technology but run into some of the problems the author discusses. One such problem is technical difficulties which can eat up class time. Another problem, I have tried many software packages only to discover that graphics are emphasized instead of content. I agree that if we let it the internet can eat up our lives. Maybe the author is a little drastic and I do not agree to the same degree but he makes some good points. We should be aware of the pitfalls of computers. They are great tools but are not the end all, be all. We need to spend time with other human beings and not look to the internet for relationships. Some parts of the book seem to ramble and was distracting. Some points were repeated and that was distracting. Keeping this in mind, I would recommend reading High-Tech Heretic."
3,High Tech Heretic Review,"In this book, Stoll presents his views on the negative impact of the emphasis on computers and technology in education. He cites examples like a lack of money for classroom supplies even though a great deal of money is spent on the purchase and maintenance of computers. Also, that instructional time is often spent setting up and learning software.His view is that in many ways technology hinders student learning yet we see an increase in that area and a decrease in the area of social activities and books. This view gives the reader a different angle to consider in a time when technology and training is so strongly stressed in education.I agree that students need strong academic content and trained caring teachers but they also need technology skills in order to be successful."
3,High-Tech Hype,"High-Tech Heretic seemed to overanalyze the use of computers in the classroom. Stoll mentions on several accounts that a good classroom needs no computers, and that a good teacher should be able to hold their lesson without that aid. In today's high-tech society, it's almost unavoidable. Its criticism and controversy will certainly hold attention and spark opinion in readers. It is both entertaining and informative. And no matter where you stand on the issue, Stoll's High-Tech Heretic is certainly a good read."
2,Review of high tech heretic,I read this book only because it was an assignment for a computer class. The author does bring up a lot of good points about how far computers have come. I do not feel that computers will take over the classroom. They do offer a lot of help for students as well as teachers. They will never be able to offer personalized assistance like a regular classroom teacher will. I would recommend this book to anyone who is highly into computers. I myself am not and did not find the book all that interesting.
2,High Tech Heretic...Don't waste your time,"I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone, unless you are completely against using computers in the classroom. I do not agree with most of the idea/concepts he gave towards using computers in the classroom. Computers can be used ineffectively and I agree that a lot of times they are, but that doesn't mean we should just completely get rid of them. They can be an excellent teaching tool if used in the right way. Children can learn so much from computer programs, but this still doesn't mean that you should completely gear your lessons/activities towards computers. Hands-on projects/assignments are always needed. Even though I didn't agree with most of the book, I did have to agree with Stoll when he said that school-age children should not have laptop!"
1,Come join us in the future,"Clifford Stroll must be locked in the 1960's still. His anti technology veiws are arcane and very naive. For one to honestly believe that computers are not helpful is beyond my capacity of reason. In the last 10 years computers have done a lot for the educational system. Don't misunderstand, I don't think Bill Gates is the mesiah or that computers are the cure all of America's educational woes, but technology has made things more convienant and the learning process now has more avenues. Now we can have options as educators instead of having to use textbooks and only textbooks. Stroll's veiws in my opinion are way off the mark."
3,High-Tech gets High Marks,"It's refreshing to finally find a computer expert that will admit that computers can overcomplicate many aspects of life. In High-Tech Heretic, Clifford Stoll explores the idea that computers shouldn't play as big a role in education as many in today's world suggest. I happen to agree with this. While computers are one of our most valuable resources they can never replace some of the most basic teaching qualities. A computer cannot replace human interaction and hands on learning. While I agree with Stoll about the role of computers in education, I disagree with him that computers should be taken out of the classroom. Computers have helped thousands of students, like me, research material, explore ideas, and meet deadlines much quicker than with traditional methods. Overall, High-Tech Heretic was a much better read than what I had first anticipated."
3,Not so likely,I feel that Charles Stoll's critique on how technologies should be used in the classroom is a good counter argument for the way in which schools are tending to head today. I disagree with the minuet amount that he wants to see computer used in our classroom. I understand his point that schools are spending too much on trying to keep up to date with the current technology. Yet I feel that if a school does not keep up on a moderate level of technology (unlike Stoll prefers) they are sacrificing the future success of the students. So I look at Stoll's approach as interesting yet not feasible for our culture. This book would be useful if you were writing a report on the subject at hand and needed a differing view than what is common.
4,Pretty Good,"I feel that the book High Tech Heretic was an okay book. In his book, Stoll does not say that he hates computers, rather they are mis-used. Therefore, he wanted to bring them out of the schools. Computers are used wrongly in many cases, but they do not need to be taken out of the schools. The educators just need to learn how to use the computers properly as a tool.So, I agree to a certain point with this part of the book.The last part of the book however, I did not find as much help. This part talked of the things surrounding computers and that was not in my interest.If you are someone that has to interact with children on a daily basis, then I feel that you should read the first half of this book."
3,High Tech Heretic,"I have to admit this wasn't one of my favorite reads but it was inciteful and it offered alot of new information to me about computer literacy. The author (clifford Stoll) seemed to disagree with the usage of computers in the classroom but it is obvious in our technology advanced world that students of all ages should be exposed to computers, it is becoming an essential life skill.Although i believe in classroom usage of computers, I also believe that over exposure to computers is prevalant in today's kids. Too many kids want to play video games all day or let the computer do their work for them, this will lead to lazy and fat kids. We need to teach our kids how to effectively use a computer and not use it as a crutch or life support.All in all this book is a good book for aspiring educators and anyone interested in computer literacy. Be careful though, this book tends to become somewhat dull and redundant."
3,Is it really necessary?,"In the book High Tech Heretic by Clifford Stoll, I only ask one question. Is it necessary that people write books about something that is extremely unnecessary in today's society? Honestly, this book is a thought of how someday teachers may be replaced by a computer. Is it necessary? There will not be a single a soul that will allow that to happen. Now, true that maybe possible in a long stretch, but today's society is not going to allow that to happen. The book also focuses on the use of federal aide spending in schools. Should that go to fixing a computer or to the more needed supplies; pencils, paper, etc...I would not reccomend this book to anyone who is reading for pleasure. Unless, of course you are looking for a good argument the whole time you read. A person should only read this book on a have-to-basis (i.e. school reading assignment, argumentive paper, etc...)."
2,High Tech Heretic,"This book is based on the question wether or not computers should be in the classroom. Stoll believes that there is far to much money and time used on computers in the classroom. He felt that all negetive imapacts in the world could be linked to computers. I personally do not agree with the scenario that is created by Stoll. I did not find anything in this book intresting thus, it received my 2 Star rating."
2,Read at your own risk,"I found Clifford Stolls work ""High-Tech Heretic"" to be in some ways interesting and eye-opening, and reactionary in others. His view of technonogy makes everything seem more frightning than it really is. Is he trying to use a scare tactic to cause people to avoid modern technology? Some issues were granted, very true and informative, however, many were just way off the wall. Reading this made me think that if a weak minded person who would believe anything would be driven to live a practically Amish existance because of fear of being taken over by machines. I found most of the material in this book to be absolutly rediculous."
3,the new computer world,I feel this book was good in some ways and bad in others. The computer has come a long way in the world of technology. However the computer will not take over the classroom. A computer can not give a child the attention they need. There has to be a teacher around to interact with a child. This book is good in that it shows the computer has come a long way. Only good this book would for it if a teacher turned it into a writig assignment. It was interesting reading the book
4,Song played on the radio in the safe house scene,Does anyone know the name of the song played on the radio when the Israeli team and the other team are in the safe house?The song is heard for about 5-10 seconds when one of the guys on the Israeli team gets up and changes the radio station from the station playing Arabic music.It has a nice catchy tune.Thank you
2,Many problems,Lockups are being reported on every board on the internet. The other problem is with the plastic cases. The plastic cracks around the hinges making the display unstable. Compaq has discontinued the parts.
4,good stuff,The 715 is a dependable laptop. As a first time buyer of laptops this system ran faster than I thought and had all the perks of a Desktop with the DVD/CDRW drive the large keypad and the fast processor. The only flaw I can find it the Graphics display on the screen. It uses the modern Thin Film Transistor screen but it doesn't seem to be very clear....however the visuals are amazing for DVD movies...go figure.All in all this is a great laptop. A little bulkier than some but not heavy. Good for the internet too. with tonnes of speed.Although I do a lot of programming I haven't as yet used the system for this and I have no idea how it works with a dual linux boot. but the AMD chip is apparently designed for Windows XP so it might run slow with another type of OS.
4,Great bang for the buck!,"I am really quite pleased with my recent purchase of the Presario 715US. By looking at the stats you know that the processor rips, etc.. The OS advances make using the CD-RW and all my external hardware a BREEZE to use. I thought I might cover some of the items that annoyed me. The unit is a bit chunky in comparison to my last notebook, the I/O panel in back has a cheesy cover that gets in the way (why is the PS/2 port behind the cover, but the network port isn't?), and last the keyboard is a little unwieldy compared to my IBM thinkpads."
1,don't buy a Compaq,"Compaq Presario 715US Notebook (1.2-GHz Athlon 4, 256 MB RAM, 20 GB hard drive)by Compaq is a peice of JUNK and the folks at Compaq are worse than their product. My warranty was for one year - parts & labor. I sent the Presaio 715 US Notebook and was told it would cost $690 and it is not covered under the warranty. It was a problem with the nick card slot and I was told I caused the problem.Even if I caused the problem, and I didn't, the warranty should fix the problem. I own two other laptops (Dells) and have never had a problem getting support on the phone or repairs. Compaqs are junk and if you buy one, you'll be sorry. Mark my word!"
5,Sissi,A wonderful film aMust See. Especially Romy Schneider - marvelous in her role as the Empress Sissi.
4,Schools for Sale Book,This is a wonderful book that my class had to purchase. It focused on school budgets and it gave scenarios on how to handle school budget situations. Good book for school administrators.
5,Perfect for showing without telling,"It looks cute and is listed as an item for young readers, but it works equally effectively for adolescents and adults. It provides an opener or a warning especially for those who have a hard time expressing themselves or have difficulty identifying how they feel. Too bad some people think because it's cartoonish, it's childish. The faces downplay the seriousness and make it less intimidating and embarrassing for some people to openly express their feelings."
4,great book,"easy on the eyes, quick read. Campbell paints a picture like he was riding ""shotgun"" to the old west. great for any history student."
2,Review,I bought this book to help learn Texas History for a teacher certification exam. While this book would be great for a history buff or someone that enjoys reading history in narrative form - it didn't suit my needs for the purchase. I was looking more for a study guide of sorts that I could develop timelines to study from - I found it hard to use this book for that as it was more designed to give a real picture of daily life during through out history. I think that it would be a good book for some - depending on your needs.
2,Bad experience,I ordered a book (Good condition) HOWEVER the condition was bad and also the book was overpriced for that condition.
2,Mediocre Texas History,"The author provides a good overview of early Spanish history and a fair summary of the Texas revolution. At this point the book takes a dramatic down turn. The second half of the book is a tedious litany of Texas politics. There is a serious lack of thoughtful examination of why individuals 'go to Texas.' The review of Texas economics is woefully inadequate in terms of depth and assessment. And the author completely misses the unique cultural aspects of Texas. For example, high school football, a particular passion in Texas is hardly mentioned. This book is a dissapointing rendering of history - akin to the worst high school text book."
2,"Be wary of ""new""","I bought a ""new"" copy that wasn't as new as advertised. The book was obviously used (it even had USED stickers on it) but was advertised as ""new"". The price was really good when I bought it so the fact that the condition wasn't as great as I expected doesn't matter too much but they shouldn't advertise the book as new if it in fact isn't."
5,Pornos and action films just don't mix.,"Despite Actor Al Leongs great performance in this movie, I feel that You can either make a Movie about sex, or an action movie, but not both. THEY JUST DON'T MIX."
3,Helpful for beginners....,"Sandra Ladendorf has written a guide for ""Southern Gardeners"" which she defines as gardens in a land area stretching from southern Long Island New York to the far Southwest -- Zone 7 and Zone 8 on the USDA map.This is a helpful book for garden beginners. Ladendorf covers the many flowers, perennial and annual, one might try with some success. One chapter covers lawn care (which I don't do as it's destructive to the environment), and another covers shrubs. She has a separate section on Azaleas and Rhododendrons.The paperback version is printed on semi-gloss paper so it can withstand some moisture if you haul it outside on the deck. I am not investing in the hardcover version as I will give this book away to a new gardener. There are many nice illustrations and decent color photographs that will help one identify the more common plants. Ladendorf includes more text than photographs, often a good sign in a ""how-to"" book."
5,Its a hit!,"This CD is full of pop hits. The first time I heard it I was surprised at the lyrical content. The second time I heard it I was singing along with ""Seven Days Without You"" like I had heard it a 1000 times before. The third time I listened to this CD I was surprised by the ""stickyness"" of the sound. With hits like Loved, Seven Days, Beautiful and more..., this CD is sure to climb the charts. Avion will sell a million albums if they can get some good exposure. Nice work Avion."
4,Sufi Meditation Guide-Not So Simple,"I bought this book hoping that I would learn a way to meditate and connect spiritually to God, however, this is a guide to be used with a spiritual teacher and comes from the point of view of this particular offshoot of Sufism. Plus, the medtitation techniques and demands are somewhat strenuous, so I would say this is a book for more advanced practitioners, not a beginner like me."
1,Good intentions but falls short on content,"An amateur attempt at Sufi meditation and healing.Although the subject is wide, deep and subtle the author is able to only provide cursory guidelines with only a few good sections. Rest is mostly a hodgepodge of different ideas or understandings the author was able to acquire.Probably his teachers have more to say on the subject."
3,hole saw,"If you use this hole saw in a portable drill, be ready for the drill to twist when the saw catches."
3,An Germanic Attempt at James Bond,"Here we have another copy cat James Bond Euro Spy thriller which were so prominant in the late sixties. Stewart Granger, in an extremely annoying and vindictive performance,is in Hong Kong trying to thwart the smuggling of nuclear weapons. Throw in fetching Rosanna Schiaffino as his partner and things start moving, unfortunately ,very slowly. You will see many Euro stalwarts such as Horst Frank,and Sieghardt Rupp. The direction by Ernst Hofbrauer is strictly by the book and the movie score by Riz Ortolani gives the movie a much needed boost. All in all, a nice time waster for a Saturday afternoon. The quality looks like its from a 16mm print in full screen and colors fluctuate throughout. Its nostalgic, none the less."
4,cool Russian alternative rock,"Auction are the best Russian rock band from the communist era still making music today. Their music is a mix of world beatish rhythms with a sort of punk sensibility and even some traditional Russian type music thrown into a blender with the result being something truly unique and undescribable. I like Auction on their own best, but this CD will tide me over till their next one comes out. See their site (in Russian) for more info: http://www.auktyon.ru/first.html"
3,Good,It's a Golden Harvest production. That tells you everything. You could watch it with the sound off and keep up with the plot. If you like Jackie Chan you'll like this movie and should be in your collection. Everything is standard fare throughout the movie until the fight scene between Jackie and Benny. WOW!
5,Jackie's great as always,"Even though this is one of his earlier movies, and the clothes really [stink], I still loved this movie. The fighting sequences are awesome... Unfortunatelly my version only had written subtitles, the language it came in was Mandarin, because this movie is packed with funny jokes!!!! I had to read every single spoken line, ugh, but well worth it!The end fight in the castle was great, very dynamic."
3,Funny and entertaining,I love jackie chan film and all the stunts he does. This just once again shows the dexterity of this actor. The action was awesome the story funny and i enjoy the seen with Benny the Jet!!!
1,Incompatable,"Why doesn't Amazon tell us that the video is incompatible with DVD players in the Western Hemisphere? We cannot play it here. I now have to figure out how to return it to the supplier, who turns out to be in Hong Kong. Wasted money, wasted effort, wasted time. Not a satisfied customer. I can't seem to get the computer to accept less than one star so it will have to be that."
5,The best fight scene of any Jackie Chan Movie,"Although there are not as many overall fight scenes in this movie, as dragons forever, this movie has the best single fight scene. A very long, unbelievably amazing fight scene takes place between Chan and Benny. The only other Chan fight sequence that comes close to this is in Police Story 2, when he fights the guys with lead pipes, in the playground."
3,not the best,"I love jackie chan movies,and have seen almost all of them. And I just don't know what to say about this one. This is directed by Samo Hung,and Samo may be funny,but hi's not a director. If you look at mr. Nice guy,also directed by Samo, you can see that it's jackies worsth movie. Wheels on Meels was not that worse. But it had it's ups and downs. The slapstick comedy wasn't funny at all this time,and there was less action. There was one good car chase in this movie, but compared to the chase in armour of god this was stupido. The end fighting seen was also very good,but nothing compared to the fighting seens in who am I,Twin Dragons,Armour of God,Project A ,police story,and rumble in the bronx. Ofcourse lora forner was gorgeous again. And that's why I rate this movie tree stars. One for Jackie, One for Lora, and one for Samo..."
3,Wheels on Meals = Great Fun,"One of the funniest movies Chan has ever done, not great on the action. Still the end fight with Benny ""THe Jet"" is amazing. Yuen and Samo are has funny has ever"
3,Dispositioned yet delightful to watch,"This film is actually not as well as his other films such as Police Story 2 and First Strike. The story is mainly a little wacky and crazy and the film scenes look pretty distorted and aged. Still, the action performed by the Three Brothers plus the final fight with Chan and ""The Jet"", this film can stand on it's own. As long as you aren't bothered by the corny story and distortion, you'll come to like this movie."
3,"Silly,silly,silly!","If you get this movie, you can pretty much fast-forward to that Chan-Urquidez fight at the end, which is spectacular even to someone who is not a huge Kung-fu fan (like me). The rest of the movie was WEIRD, though. The plot was silly, and the dubbing was OBNOXIOUS, to say the least! I am a big Chan-fan, and I guess since I don't speak Chinese I didn't consider this to be the funniest movie of his career! I thought Twin Dragons was much funnier! But I'd have to recommend this one just for that boxing-match near the end. It really is fantastic!!"
2,Take one..action! ..action?? Where *is* the action?,"If the first 5 minutes of this film had set the tone for the rest of the movie, this should've been a wonderful piece. As it turned out, this wasn't so much of a flop as it was a mild disappointment. The fight sequences are few and far between, while the comedy was...well, you know what to expect if you're a fan of this genre. :^) Sammo did a much better job directing Encounters of the Spooky Kind than he did with this movie--> I'd recommend Dragons Forever if you want to see Jackie, Yuen, and Sammo in some good action scenes. This film doesn't quite do any of the three justice."
2,it was so boring my mom left in the middle of it.,"My mom who is a big fan of jackie chan hated this movie and so did I. The best part is when jackie fights benny ""The Jet"" in the finale. That is the only reason I gave it stars"
5,Great,"This game is the BEST! If you like stratagy games then youhave to get it. If you played and liked Civilizaton I or II then youwill love this. It comes with a fold out tech chart, a statagy guied and of course the cd. the diplomacy options are the best, much better then anything else that i have played. however it has not so good graphics. all in all it is a very good game, and i suggest that you buy it..."
1,Sorry it's not jazz any more,I have loved Ibrahim's themes like 'The Wedding' and 'Ishmael' but they were jazz tunes. Here you can listen to a String Orchestra playing some rhythmless tunes . Where is jazz ?
2,Strings Attached,"McCoy Tyner combines incredible passion and technical virtuosity to achieve a distinctive sound from the piano. Many tremendous albums were put out on the Milestone label during the 70s, both with a small group live (Enlightenment, Atlantis, The Greeting; all 4-5 stars easily) or in a studio (Sahara, Focal Point, etc.), and with a big band (Song of the New World).This album adds a string section, which does much to dilute the drive of McCoy's music. It does however, make it sound like a 70s concept album. As much as McCoy Tyner could ever be suited for background listening, this is it. If you think light music is a good thing, then this is a great Tyner album for you. I, however, would rather listen to one of his many thrilling, truly 5-star albums."
5,A 70s Jazz Classic,"I first fell in love with this album while in college, and to this day it is still a favorite jazz album of mine. Powerful yet beautiful, it's a wonderful transition between fusion and traditional jazz. The title track alone, with McCoy's piano work within the orchestration, is worth the price of the album in my book. From Tyner's piano work to Cobham's drumming to Laws' flute, I consider this 70s jazz classic essential to every jazz lover's collection. I can safely say that everyone I've ever shared this album with has always wanted to obtain it for themselves."
1,NOT GOOD for a high school Review Book,"Very technical. Overly technical and obscure techniques lead students away from what they are supposed to do for the test. If you want to learn C idioms, go for it. If you want a review book for APCS, get soemthing else."
3,Mixed bag/,"This Spanish outfit is somewhat of a mixed bag. They certainly have their respective talent as musicians. The guitarist and keyboardist in particular are responsible for some intriguing passages not unlike Genesis' sound in the Selling England By The Pound era. The drumming is not particularly inspired (or inspiring) but is passable. The vocalist tends to sing in the upper registers (like many contemporary prog vocalists) and has nothing particularly unique to offer. I was not impressed with him. Overall, this outfit is competent with the ability to transcend such competence and reach for something more but often fails to do so. They have yet to manage to add anything new to the genre....Simon"
3,"3 stars,1/2-should be the right rate,paying a tribute to Yes","Well the right score is 3 stars and 1/2, this album remaining their best, even if the rythmical section isn't always inspiring !! There are 2 long tracks only, concerning a conceptual and mythological theme...""Nunca de Noche"" concludes the album, this song being the best track of the album, by means also of a strong piano...moreover a lot of excursus at the moog synths and sometimes their romantic imitation of Yes too, keep on maintaining the tension quite high. They certainly pay a tribute, but apart from some discontinuos moments, this lp isn't bad...anyway I prefer these derivative moments than those ones of their second album ""Chasing the dragonfly"", by which they try to be more experimental, often failing..."
4,What if the Stones were a new band in the 90's?,"The Chesterfield Kings are a great cover band. When they choose to replicate a band's material, not only do the actual covers sound like the original band, but (and this is the important part)the new songs sound like ""lost"" songs by that band. The Black Crowes only WISHED they sounded this much like the late 60's version of the Stones. However, I don't want this to sound like it's all covers. Only two of the songs are Stones' covers (there are a couple other covers as well). Buy this CD for the originals, especially if you keep complaining that they (including the Stones!!) don't make them like they used to. Listen to the sample from Drunkhouse and tell me that you don't want to own this CD immediately. I've personally bought 5 copies over the years to give to friends, and everybody has LOVED it."
3,England's Newest Hitfakers,"Sometimes the line between homage and parody is as blurred as ""Let's Go Get Stoned""'s cover art. Chesterfield Kings singer Greg Prevost does a deadly accurate Mick Jagger imitation, mixed with such exaggerated helpings of funny and cruel that it's hard to untangle his intent. But the music behind him ( Nuggets-worthy R&B-based garage rock vainly grasping for the stars) kicks as hard as the Stones in '66, so his intentions get to have it both ways: tribute and parody. Come to think of it, the greatest moments of the Stones themselves tend to straddle that same fence. Nicely done."
3,If you are a newbie,For someone who wants to learn dreamweavermx fast and easy...this is not the book for you. This is just too simplistic. I recommend How to Do Everything with dreamweaverMX.
4,Blind Alley,Jane was the main target in this book. The promise of an other adventure is promised to come in the near future. This was a harder read it seemed to me.
5,Iris Johansen is the BOMB!,This is the umpteenth book of her's that I've read and I just can't quit. I'll read them all just like I read all of Tess Geritsen's
3,Easy read,"I was looking for an easy read, a nice mystery that wouldn't tax my mind. This was perfect. It was fun and well put together. There was some sort of a psycic or reincarnation theme going on but it wasnt' too freaky. There was a serial killer but it wasn't too graphic. The dialog was simple, easy to follow. The romance was light, not annoying or overdone. It was worth my time. Just what I was looking for this weekend."
2,My Lips Twisted,"This book introduced some new characters into the series. Except for Bartlett, the characters all have the same personality as other characters. If I see ""his lips twisted"" or ""her lips twisted"" one more time, I will scream. Trevor was good as a love interest for Jane but it was the same as Logan with Sarah. Obviously, the author wrote cheesy romance novels that youcan crank out without changing anything except the locale from novel to novel. The same is happening with this series of books. I was a little bewildered at the reviews claiming pedophilia from Trevor. A seventeen year old woman is at her prime. If a man tells you that he is not attracted to a woman at that age then he is lying or gay. My mother married at 16, her mother at 17. I just started reading this series and I'm hoping for some improvement in the rest of the books."
1,First... and last Johansen novel?,"This is in reference to the audio book.This book is awful. Really, really awful. I am stopping halfway through, which is something I've never done. I'm currently hoping that an atomic bomb goes off a the end, but I don't care enough to go that far with it. Do people really love this author?"
1,Tenacity Not Pleasure,"I think this book was boring, and I find it hard to believe a good author like Iris Johansen wrote it.Because of tenacity I was determined to finish this book once I started to read it. I never quite ""got"" what the author was trying to say. Jane especially annoyed me, and I got tired of hearing about the ""team"".Elise Smith"
1,Disappointed,"This was the first book by Iris Johansen that I have read. I bought it due to the enthusiastic reviews on the back cover or on the first pages in the book.I do not know how her other books are, because this book was as bad as they rarely come.One-dimensional characters, repetitive thoughts/actions (just in case somebody had not got it the first or second time), illogical actions (visitor from Scotland Yard shows up at the private home, not at the police station, and our heroes do not even bother to ask for identification, ......)I could not develop any sympathies for the protagonists, and frankly, I do not care if they get murdered or not.I have no idea if the other books by this author are better, but I do not intend to find out.One is more than enough.Annoying, irritating, boring.Sorry!"
1,"I agree with Reviewer: J. Mullally ""CBDB"" (NY NY)","In addition to everything J. Mullally said, I skipped a few of Johansen's books because I got so tired of the word ""stiffened"" every half dozen pages or so. How about trying some other tired word like ""he (or she) bristled"" once in awhile? I got more out of the Amazon synopsis and reviews than from the book. I liked the first couple in the series, but there wasn't much in the way of forensics here."
2,cliche' after cliche',"I was able to get through this book primarily because of two reasons: 1. I had never read anything by Iris Johansen before, so I was loathe to give up quickly 2. I was suffering from a temporary lack of other available reading material.My friend John likes to say that nobody ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the average person. I think this book is a good example of that.The book wasn't totally without merit, or completely unentertaining. It was however full of cliches', which I won't mention specifically as they would be considered 'spoilers', but like a fruit cart getting toppled chase scene in an action film, or a 'bullet from nowhere' that takes out the villain (right between the eyes, of course) at the last possible moment before the innocent victim meets his or her demise, this book is full of overdone, outworn situations, constructs and outcomes."
1,really bad,I was so bored with this book. It just went on and on and on...I love Iris Johansen and have read all of her other books. They were all great. I dont know what happened here. Just trying to get a book out???? I hope she does better next time.
5,Enjoyed the Ride!,"I got the audio version of this book to listen to during my long daily commute. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Perhaps because this was my first Iris Johansen book, I wasn't comparing it to her earlier works. It was well read and kept me looking forward to getting in my car each morning and evening! I am glad I didn't read the negative reviews since they may have colored my opinion. Frankly, I enjoyed the characters and look forward to more books with Eve, Joe, Jane and Mark Trevor. If you enjoy forensic mysteries, give this book a try."
1,What a farce,This story went nowhere fast. Very unbelievable on so many levels. Jane/Chrira really bothered me and the way she grew into this pig-headed brat made the book hard to finish. I'll give her another try... but I hope Iris doesn't let me down again.
2,It's Not My Cup Of Tea; It Seems I'm Not Alone.,"I found two paperbacks at work, which were both thriller series, both written by women, both having two word titles with the first word being ""Blind."" One of the two I found exciting and satisfying, and eagerly read it. That was not this book.At first, I thought it was just me. Unlike others, I found it easy to get into the book. But I found it too new age for me. Between Eve talking to her dead daughter to the creepy Aldo to Jane's connection with the murdered Cira, I decided I didn't need to read the whole novel and checked to make sure Jane and Trevor survived.Maybe this wasn't Iris Johansen's best book. But I'm not going to be trying any of her others, based on this one."
4,Mixed,"I'm not really going to give a summary because there are already plenty up. As another reviewer already said, the ideas are far fetched and the story is very believable. So why did I give it such a high rating despite the fact the it isn't very well written. I don't really know. Despite the fact that it has pretty much everything going against it, I can't help but love it. I can't explain it and I hadn't read any of the author's other books before reading this, so that isn't clouding my judgement. There is just something about this book that still manages to draw the reader in."
1,Horrible,Horrible is the only way I can describe this book. The plot was silly and the story was boring. This was the worst book I have read in 4 yrs.
1,a good author goes bad,"This was sad. I hate it when one of my favorite authors burns out. This drivel was a waste of paper. I read firestorm, and it stinks too. I guess Johansen has lost it."
4,Pleasurable Read,"Unlike some of the other reviewers, I enjoyed this book. Primarily because why some disliked it - it was not all about Eve. I have gotten sick of Eve Duncan and almost wish that she would find her daugther's body and have it over and done with.I have read all of Ms. Johansen's books and it was only because of her name that I picked this one up initially. As soon as I saw ""Eve Duncan"" on the front cover, my excitement level dropped off but I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was not all about Eve.The only quibble I have with the story line is that I do not think that most readers are able to enjoy reading about a 17 year old and a ""can't be over 30"" year old. It would have been more palatable to make their ages closer and out of the statutory rape range. It was done in Reap the Wind, albeit not with the main characters.I look forward to reading Coutdown since Jane will be 21 ;-)"
2,Disappointing,"I have read a majority of Iris Johansen's books, with high expectations. This book was so dissapointing. The plot was so farfetched and unbelievable that I could not buy into the premise. I was determined to finish the book and was disappointed at the end to see that see that she was continuning the story through another book. When you have high expectations of an author and are dissapointed like this I will think twice before purchasing again!!"
3,A Typical Johansen book,"I have read every suspense novel that Iris Johansen has written. Unfortunately, if you have read one, you have read them all. The ""tough as nails"" heroine overcoming her obstacles to emerge victorious. Let us not forget the psycho killer that forms an obsession with our heroine. All in all a decent book. I think I can finally say I have spent the last of my hard-earned money on a Johansen hardcover."
2,How disappointing,"As all avid mystery readers know, we've come to adopt those characters we find in our favorite books, into our hearts and homes. What a wonderful story teller Ms. Johansen is, and I enjoy her enormously. I do have a few questions and comments, though.Has Eve Duncan always been as whiney and shallow as this book depicts her to be? We all come to expect certain behavior and dialogue between characters, but if I wanted to hear this much whining, I'd call my mother and listen to her whine about not being able to go to Miami this year.Sorry, this book bored me to tears, and if it had been a movie, I never would have gone back from the snack shop.And for all those mothers with 17 year old daughters, I think we'd all agree to chip in and buy a DNA sample from Jane to add to our daughter's lunches. How wonderful she is!! Especially when she pretty much announces that she wishes to have an affair with a 30+ con man."
2,First and Last Time?,"This is the first Iris Johansen thriller I have read and unfortunately it will probably be my last. The characters are so predictable in their responses to each other that I knew what they would say before they said it. I listened to it as a book on tape which probably made that worse. But Jane, the focus of the book, is simply unbelievable. Aldo and his ""obsession"" strain credibility. The best part was the information about life in ancient Herculaneum and the volcanic eruption."
2,Too much left unanswered,"I am usually quite an avid fan, but this book left too many holes. What brought on Jane's dreams? Did Trevor have the same dreams? what ever became of the ""real"" person the dreams were about? Is Jane phycsic now? Whose face was the last one that Eve sculpted (if that's a real word)? It almost seems like she is setting it up so you will have to purchase the next book just to get the answers to this one. And did the dreams somehow imply that Jane and Trevor are meant to be together?And yes, I am sick of Eve holding it against Joe that he lied to her years ago. He was trying to help ease her pain, she knows it, she has stayed with him all this time, get over it already."
2,Okay...,"After reading a couple of Iris Johansen's books, I thought that this book would be entertaining and a fun read. My main complaint with this book was the lack of character development/relationship between Jane and Cira. Where was the connection? Just because someone has a close resemblance does not make them the same. I felt like Ms. Johansen began with a neat plot twist but let it get lost between the pages. I would suggest taking less time weaving a frayed ""fantastic plot"" and more time with actual character and story development."
1,Awful,"This is another author writing a book supposedly about one character when it is really about another. Patricia Cornwell did it when she lost interest in Kay Scarpetta and now this author is doing it with her Eve Duncan character. If you wish to write about a new character than PLEASE don't disguise it behind a character that readers have known. I will NOT buy another book about Jane. She is too young, too immature. I bought this book happy to be reading about Eve Duncan, NOT 17 year old Jane. And the new book promises to be all about Jane and Trevor. I don't care to hear about this couple. Shes too young for him, and it made me feel creepy to hear about the sexual tension between a 17 year old and 30+ year old. Don't waste your money on this if you are looking for Eve Duncan, She's not here!"
2,Farfetched,"The beginning of the book is a thriller, I can accept that, but when a 17 years old kid made a plan to find the person who want to kill her and everybody accept her as the bait is really farfetched. Everything they do to trap the killer is pathetic. The trip to Italy and changing the newspapers in the web is hilarious. The end, when everybody stays alive except the killer is just a way to end this fairy tale in the most pathetic way."
1,Extremely disappointing,"I had read some of Iris Johansen's other novels and found them interesting. This one was extremely disappointing. The plot is extremely far-fetched and stretches credulity to the breaking point. But most disappointing is the stilted dialogue which just doesn't ring real. The one saving grace was the interesting historical information about Pompeii/Herculaneum.When I finished reading this novel, I wondered: How does a book like this on to the bestseller lists? Are we all sheep?"
4,Great Book,"I really enjoyed this book. I read it one day. Some of it was a little off the wall, but still a great read. I have read all of Johansen's books and she continues to be one of my favorites."
2,Not her best,"I was glad to see it wasn't just me who had problems with this book. I have read all of Iris Johansen's books and have loved them. Picking up one of her books always was a guarantee that you would spend several action packed enjoyable hours. This one, however, I could not get in to. I tried several times, but ended up flipping to the end chapter and then putting the book in the ""to give away"" pile. I hope that her next book - sequel or continuation of Jane's story - turns out better than this one. To me, a major disappointment."
3,A definite improvement.,"This second book of Ms. Benjamin's was a huge improvement over her first book. At least in this book, the main focus is Lisa's alleged suicide and not the actual dog component of the book. However, as with the first book, I like the fact that Rachel throws herself into the case with tenacity. However, I think Rachel's concept of 'walking in Lisa's shoes' by going so far as to stay at Lisa's apartment, wear Lisa's clothes and jewelry, and doing all the activities that Lisa did was a little over the top. There's a big leap from putting yourself in somebody's place to completely taking over their life. The people who were part of Lisa's life who are Rachel's prime suspects are all odd and quirky, but it leant more to the story when trying to figure out which one did it and why."
3,What I expected,I found the book to be basically what I expected. The reviews and summaries are accurate. It's not a difficult read.
4,A classic in market microstructure theory,"I do not imagine a faculty of management's library without this book avalailable for M.Sc. and Ph.D. students.As opposed to another reviewer, I really liked the structure. Starting with inventory problems, then dealing with asymetric information and finally going thru agent's strategic behavior; you get the big picture regarding the main issues in market microstructure.Maybe a bit more detail and explanations on the derivation of some basic models would have been more value added. Unfortunately, you must move on to the original published academic paper to get a fully understanding of any particular model. You cannot rely exclusively on the book."
5,Really nice book!,"Perfect to review material from various papers, very good for initial introduction to the field, very nice for systematizing the material!"
1,Lacks in both organization and clarity .,"The book is meant to describe market microstructure. My discovery is that one needs to know a lot about the subject matter to get anything out of it. I had the feeling of reading footnotes without seeing the text! It quotes authors and papers without the slightest indication as to what they are about. I do not recommend it. But there are other books covering the subject. Campbell, Lo and McKinlay (The Econometrics of Financial Markets) proovides in one chapter more information that this book. FInally, there is a French book on the topic that is excellent; it would call for a translation (the authors are Biais,Foucault & Hillion)."
2,Didn't last,Had this item for about 4 months. Seams started opening and that was the end of this item. Very disappointing.
3,very honest memoir,"Gregory's book details her life from meeting the guy who offered her money to smuggle drugs, to her life in Thai prisons, adapting to the harsh way of life and finally moving back home to a British prison. The development of her character from beginning to end is evident to all through her concise narrative about her guilt and shame, especially when she speaks of her family members. All in all, this is a haunting real-life story that shouldn't be missed by anyone, especially Caucasians travelling for long periods of time in Southeast Asia. The temptation may be great when funds are running low, but the horrors of prisons in the less-developed regions are not exaggerated."
4,Going to Bangkok on vacation can be risky!,"I just finished reading ""Forget You Had a Daughter"" by Sandra Gregory and I found it to be one scary book. Young people take a lot of chances and this young lady took one too - big mistake. She should have just called home and asked her parents for money. That's what parents are there for (I'm a parent, and I know!). I enjoyed the book immensely and felt badly for the author who lost a lot of years in her young life to prison. Glad that she's doing well now and has moved on! On a lighter note, my daughter walked past the book on my dresser and was very hurt to think that I would read a book about trying to forget that I had her. I had to explain the title to her and I also had to interject a life lesson about the potential dangers of traveling abroad with drugs. I think she was sorry she brought the whole subject up!"
4,"Very readable & Intriguing, but Depressing, too","I felt the gamut of emotions when I read this book. I felt there weren't enough words described by the author for her reason to smuggle the drugs in the first place.She described how she needed the money, but what were the underlying real reasons she would put herself through such risk? I never felt satisfied with her answer. I kept wondering how anyone would risk being jailed abroad--maybe a combination of youthful naivete' and extreme risk taking?Her account of her prison time was heart breaking and difficult to read, at times. She is truly a survivor."
3,Tripp Lites U232-006 USB 2.0 File Transfer Cable,"Installation is different than described in booklet. I had to go through phone hell (twice) to finally get this installed. The procedure is different than the simple directions given. Was told I would get call back(that's what they do when they don't know anything else to try),waited till next day and of course I had to call again,go through same menu/hold mess,go through all the same steps as day before BUT this person actually got it installed. O.K. it works, but if you transfer large files (which is why you buy this thing) it will time out and if you try to start transfer again it will CRASH. You have to close out then reopen transfer program or it will crash your computer. I haven't had a crash in years since I went to XP! They need to work the bugs out. I'd try a different brand if I were you. Their are a few to choose from.If you don't have huge music files or whatever I'd just get a thumb drive,MUCH EASIER. Good Luck"
4,WHAT YOU GOT ?,"WHAT YOU GOT IS A MIX A BLUES,BALLARDS AND SOME ROCKIN BLUES. CD STARTS WITH A FINE NUMBER CALLED I SMELL SMOKE W/ SOME FINE GUITAR PLAYING TO THE BLUES ARE NOTHING BUT A GOOD MAN FEELING BAD. IF YOU ENJOY DIFFERENT TYPES ARE BLUES ON ONE CD THIUS IS THE CD FOR YOU"
1,First one didn't work,"Impressed by the specs and price I bought this unit. After hooking it all up it wouldn't let me do the registration and setup. Called Compaq, very helpful tech said software wasn't properly installed at factory. Said it'd take 3-4 days to get the recovery discs they'd send me! Called store where I bought it, sposed to get another unit from them today. Hope this isn't a indication of things to come!"
1,Seal off on one bottle,"I ordered three bottles of this product. One came with the seal removed. The opened bottle had an off odor. I did use it on my skin, and got a bad itch and rash. The other two bottles were sealed.I opened one of the sealed bottles and it was fine, no problem. The merchant delivered on time without any problem, but I was not pleased due to the bottled that arrived unsealed. Order this product from some one else, I do not recommend this merchant, and give it one star only-but none if I could."
2,Poor packaging,"Was the soap I was looking for. Did arrive quickly. Only problem with it is how they shipped it resulted in a small puncture in the bottle, so will probably be finding another company to purchase this from"
2,green soap,"Delivery was 10 times faster than expected due to proximity of suppliers location. Product is not USP grade soap and does smell like it contains large quantity of coconut oil, perhaps. Will not buy again because I seek pharmaceutical grade."
2,bad sound,the dvd player is great but if your looking to use the subwoofer for anything buy something else the sub is under the bottom which makes the sound muffled and the speakers are not that loud for a kids room maybe but not anything else
5,Love the smell of this,I use this perfume for special occasions only. I love this perfume because it's not to overpowering or nauseating. It's light and fresh and beautiful. Love it!
5,Wonderful CD,"The song Heaven help me was such an awesome song. I have loved this song since, I was a small child. He is an awesome artist and pairing up with George made this cd great."
4,Hmmmm...... seems it is George afterall.....,"allmusic.com, my online source for information lists this song on the Album Spell, which is a Deon Estus album, but it lists it as written by George Michael as well as 'performed by' George Michael.Go figure! What's it doing on a Deon Estus album then?It is a beautiful song, regardless of who is singing it.If it walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, it must be a duck, eh?It's labeled a George Michael song in my collection.Now, if only I could find the album art for it."
2,"GEORGE MICHAEL IS A GENEROUS FRIEND, INDEED...","... because I swear that that's him singing the lead vocal on ""Heaven Help Me""... but then again, it's amazing how much they can tinker with a lead vocal in the studio... in any event, it's at least 50% of George's voice all over this song... other than that, this recording ""SMELLs""."
1,Do not buy this!!!!!!!!!,"Hi,I had bought this from [retail store]. After a day two pixels burnt on the screen. I exchanged it for another one. The CD/RW didnt work on the second one. Exchanged it for a third one. This one had one big red spot on the screen (burnt pixel) when I opened the box. My patience was running out. I still got the 4th one after exchange. This one did the same thing. Pixel burnt again.I called Compaq for explanation. They said they consider it normal till 5 burnt pixels. And they will not fix it until more than 5 pixels are burnt. I am glad that I bought it from the store so I could return it. I have exchanged 4 laptops in 3 weeks and wasted a lot of time. Please dont buy this if you want a perfect screen.Kamlesh."
4,It cleaned up my cord clutter!,"I would give this grommet 5 stars for Durability and Aesthetics, but only 2 stars for Ease of Installation. It requires a particular size of hole saw that is unlikely to be in most people's tool kits. Failing that, the use of a slightly smaller, more standard hole saw mandates some serious work with a rasp.That said, the end result is very clean and functional. I was able to run all the cords coming from my powered USB hub up through the grommet, where they're held for immediate use just by gently pulling them up through the petals. Returning the cords through the grommet requires a bit of guidance, but it's certainly not difficult.All in all, the result was well worth the effort for me!"
4,Warbirds International,"Excellent magazine for WW II enthusiasts. Only Negative, if there is one, that it doesn't come out monthly. A subscription is recommended as (I) couldn't remember if I bought it already and when it came out."
3,Is this book advanced? because thats what i need to play,"I haven't checked out this book yet, i want it! jill"
5,very good book,"As a teacher in Brazil I adopt this book in my classes. This book is the one of the best on compiler design. I also use the ""Dragin Book"" among others."
4,Wes Plays the Blues,"Wes Montgomery, the most significant jazz guitarist since pioneer genius Charles Christian (Freddy Green didn't solo) is heard here in various styles. We have the quartet, the large band, blues, non-blues, a quartet version of ""Willow Weep for Me"" and a big band version of ""West Coast Blues"" (compare the quartet version on ""Incredible Jazz Guitar""). Likewise various great sidemen: Wynton Kelly, Paul Chambers, Jimmys Cobb and Smith, et al. And yes, the flowing lead lines in the Christian tradition; the octaves. Wes doesn't appear to have been recorded enough in pure jazz settings making this CD a necessity for serious listeners of the jazz guitar."
3,It was slow and dry,"Wes montgomery did an outstanding job putting together ""Zazz 'Round midnight. If someone had told me that I was listening to Kenny Burrell, I would have said that it sounded like something on about that level. Burrell is usually a 3, maybe a 3 1/2 jazz musician."
1,JDM Ultimate is an UNRELIABLE Merchant,"For all of you auto enthusiasts, make sure that you are aware that JDM Ultimate is an unreliable merchant. I have placed an order for Skunk2 Rear Camber Kits on two different occaisions in the last month. In both cases, the items were shown to be In Stock. In both cases, the orders were summarily cancelled after several days by JDM Ultimate. In one case, the cancellation was made without notification. If you need high quality parts and expect rapid order fulfillment and good customer service, JDM Ultimate is NOT the company with which to do business. Based on my experinces, I suggest that you do business with another vendor."
4,Keeps me busy,"It makes things very easy to follow, and has alot of great information. A must have for the book shelf."
2,expensive and still loaded with typos and other errors,"This book proves that a good publisher makes a difference, and that prentice hall does not qualify. I've never seen a computer book that contains so many errors. Combined with the hideous layout of the goldfarb series, this should be enough to keep you far away from it. BTW: i've added a second star, because valuable stuff is hidden in it; you just have to work too hard to get there.If you're new to python, buy learning python and programming python instead. if you want to apply xml with python, use the web to learn more. Only buy this book if it's *deeply* discounted, or if you're looking for job as a book editor. Otherwise, you'll end up rewarding incompetent publishing."
1,"Too basic, too much irrelevant material","There are some useful nuggets in this book, but there is also a lot of material that doesn't directly relate to processing XML. The author spends an inordinate amount of space discussing things like AWK, filename globbing on Windows, installing software, and other irrelevant items. The software tools used as examples in the book were written for earlier versions of Python and the Python XML libraries; they do not work with the current releases of Python and PyXML, and no updates are available on the author's web site."
2,What's this about?,"I haven't clue what this book is about and how it relates to real life problem solving. I use SAX2 and DOM parsers daily and they are an integral part of my software projects. I fond this book to be a total waste of time and money and I would not, could not recommend it. The O'Reilly Book on the other hand it a gem"
3,The end of the world set to music,"What do you get when you combine Godley & Creme, harmonicas, gospel style backing vocals and songs about full scale world war? Goodbye Blue Sky. This album came out in 1988. I found a cutout of it on cassette (gasp) for a buck. Godley & Creme are usually too quirky for their own good (re: Concequences) but this effort is relatively tame. ""Sweet Memory"" is the most memorable of the bunch. If you love 10cc (especially the G & C penned tunes) you'll appreciate this one. Until now, it was hard to find on CD."
5,This ranks 20 stars!,"Great Music - for relaxing, calming atmosphere- just feeling better about the world in general!"
5,fascinating,I am generally not a fan of modern psychological methods and their inability to face the spectre of death and the fundamental decay of our 'modern' civilisation (primitive cultures were much more sensible in their organization in comparison with the capitalist terror we have created).. This is precisely why dr. yalom's book appeals to me.. It is a certain breed of existensial psychology that looks at death head on.. but credit must also be given to yalom's obvious personal report with his patients and his understanding of humanity (something experience seems to play a key role in)..I have never been so struck by the personal accounts of the theraputic process in the very moving stories yalom has compiled here.. I found myself completely absorbed from the first pages on.. I feel that i have greatly benefited from reading this book.
5,Thank You Dr. Yalom,"An incredible book. Dr. Yalom restored my faith in therapists and human beings. I have read the book twice and given to many friends as gift. The most healing aspect of the book is one's realization that EVERY individual is flawed, conflicted, volunerable ... and the journey of self-discovery and acceptance is the only path to reaching inner-peace and content."
5,First Class,Evrything I've read by Yalom has been both personally and professionally helpful beginning with his group therapy book in graduate school. His stories are well developed and his insights are first class. You can learn a great deal about the work of psychotherapy from reading this book. I also recommended it to a client who loved it. Enjoy!
4,Great Class Text,This book was assigned as part of a class in my Masters in Psychology program. The book is filled with stories about Yalom and his clients and as a future therapist I find it fascinating. I would read it even if it were not assigned. He offers an insider view as to how a therapist views his own internal dialogue and experiences in the therapeutic process.
5,Brilliant!,"This is a must for anyone interested in Psychotherapy. Beautifully written, the tales are incredibly honest accounts of cases Yalom has dealt with. I have recommended the book to many of my friends and colleagues. A must!"
2,Yalom's lack of self-awareness is appalling,"I think the ""overweight"" woman who Dr. Yalom had a hard time relating to should send him a bill for the ""breakthrough"" she helped him achieve.I am reminded of the line from the movie, Dangerous Liasions, ""Like most intellectuals, he's intensely stupid."""
1,Self-absorbed and frightening,"This book does describe the therapists clinical encounters and, in almost scary detail, his own personal thoughts. I say 'scary' as almost every encounter with a female patient is about how this married therapist fantasizes about her! The analyses of the other patients is also kind of strange - one patient regrets not having children and has a dream where he meets a daughter he never had. Dr Yalom interprets this as the patient meeting his ""female side"" and wanting to be in greater touch with it (!?). I'm no therapist but I would have thought the more obvious interpretation was that it was related to his regret about not having children.......the only reason I can see in buying this book is that the cover price is small compared to even one of Dr Yaloms therapy sessions - and reading the book may put you off ever bothering wasting your money on consulting this therapist."
2,Not as bad as it could have been......,"I had to get this book from a class. I'm working on getting my Masters in Counseling. I thought that some of the stories were interesting. The book starts with it's ""good stuff."" The middle was ok. The last couple stories were dull. If you have to read this enjoy finding the themes that thread through all the stories. If you're looking for something to lull you into sleep read the last two stories in the book."
4,Book is more feasible,"This is very pessimist book. Very difficult to read. With no past therapy experience on any Therapist couch, I felt terrified with the experiences of the Therapists, not to name patients. From time to time, I feel that this is a profession of the affluent only, and the people on the other side of the equator, are luck that they do not have that much money to spend but pray God, in order to keep themselves sane, which is much cheaper. Price of the book is just a fraction of cost of one hour on the couch, so that book reading is much more feasible."
4,Love's Executioner,"I'm not done with it, but I'm enjoying it so far. Can't wait to finish it and then I'll give more info."
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE,I recommend this book to ANYONE. What an amazing book written by an astounding therapist. This book definitely highlights the process the therapist goes through while performing therapy. Also Dr. Yalom offered some excellent education insight into the practice of therapy. Easy to read and entertaining!
4,Very touching,"I enjoy those anecdotals which reveal what's going on inside of the therapist's head. Thankfully, Yalom -while at times arrogant and conceited- shows a more touching side by admitting when he's been stumped, felt apathetic, scared, etc. Basically, it's his usual honesty but in a more touching context. For that reason alone, I was able to go back to some of his other written works and understand that he's direct because he doesn't know any other way to be, and such directness is often misperceived as arrogance. We can learn much from Dr. Yalom, and there's a good chance you will likely fly through this book and reflect on some of those stories often if you're an up-and-coming clinician; this is a good thing, because anyone who expects you to operate perfectly is a fool. If Yalom can admit he's only human and find those connections which transcend theory, then you can -and should- too."
5,Insightful and Poignant,"Rarely does one get to look inside of another's mind through the one person who has such up close and personal experience with them, especially when they are troubled. I love to see how people work and what makes them tick and these stories have given me something to work with. They stay with me for days after I read them. I bought a copy for my son, who is finishing his Master's degree in Psychology."
5,excellent,"a great writer, funny, smart, and insightful. despite its professional context, the book reveals yalom's biases about fat girls, and admitting he is wrong in the right circumstances. any psychologist could learn a lot from this book. those who only have an interest in psychology should be thoroughly entertained as well."
5,Love's Executioner,"This book was very informative as well as entertaining. I learned a great deal about the process of psychotherapy. I was particularly interested in how Dr. Yalom made his interpretations, and how he proceeded to devise an approach that best suited the patient he was treating. Of particular interest were the patients' dreams and Dr. Yalom's interpretations. It was also very inspiring to see the way the patients themselves used the findings in their therapy, and then proceeded to change their approach to life and eventual happiness."
5,Chiapas beans- Fair Price,"Was surprised that Chiapas green coffee beans actually being offered and for a decent price. I've roasted several small batches and the crema is pretty good (for a Central American coffee bean). If you're a fan of the Guatalman/Mexican coffees form the region, can't go wrong here."
3,USB Phone connection & software,The product advertised was not on the product CD because it did not include the current phone model. Had to download support from vendors web site. That did not work well. Tied up my PC for hours and then failed. Finally got it to work after many hours.
4,Hope you've got a while to read it...,"It's undeniably a good book. I learned so much from it...BUT I almost feel like I was inundated with too much information. I don't deny that the details make the story interesting, but pages devoted to how many pounds of dried soup Lewis bought didn't really interest me. I did enjoy that it gave more attention to Sacagawea than you'd get in a typical US History class."
4,Magnificent History Lesson,"Reading this book took me into another world where many of the places I have already been were discovered for the first time. In the eyes of an explorer, what could they have felt? Ambrose's writing was wonderful in presenting characters that lived, breathed and travelled at great personal risk over a frontier that wasn't nearly as deserted as they believed. His ability to describe a world were news travelled as fast as a man on the fastest horse gave heart to what life was like in the time of the expedition. I am not a big reader of non-fiction but recommend this book highly to anyone that wonders what ""pioneer spirit"" is."
4,"Long, but good",I really enjoyed this book. It is 20 CDs long and I got thru it pretty quick. I really feel I now know the entire incredible story. Jefferson and Lewis were true genius and Lewis and Clark were true heroes.
5,Undaunted Courage,"Great book by a great author ""Stephenn E. Ambrose. Easy read that lays out each step in the process for the Meriwether and Lewis's grand march to the Pacific Ocean."
4,Don't give up on this book,"It was a little slow for the first 100 pages, but then delivered a riveting experience. This book changed my impression of the age -- including Jeffersonian politics, life on the frontier, the conquest of the continent, technology, and the American Indians -- more than any other book I've read in recent memory. Especially a good read for these times, when so much revisionism is operating in the media. It was fascinating to read Lewis' matter-of-fact observations about the tribes he encountered on his route."
5,"Undaunted Courage : Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and","Unapologetically, Ambrose reveals his personal enthusiasm for his subject in this delightful telling of the Lewis and Clark story. I thoroughly enjoyed learning about Jeferson's role in the undertaking and the little told story of Lewis' end. Ambrose makes this history live! If you plan on reading his new book on the transcontinental railroad (I just started it), I highly recommend you read Undaunted Courage first as it sets the scene for the coming development of the West."
4,Tag Along on a Magnificent Journey...,"A remarkable chronicle of Lewis & Clark's difficult journey through the heartland in the early 1800's. Largely sourced in the extremely detailed journal kept by Captain Lewis, we are provided detailed accounts of Indians, terrain, animals, plants, and other things that arose throughout the journey.This work gives the reader an excellent feel for how difficult frontier life was at the time. Also makes you appreciate what a wonderful ""skill set"" Lewis possessed: as an amateur botanist, naturalist, linguist, diplomat and so forth.This book is a must read for those who have an interest in early American history..."
5,Agree With Author,"I agree with author Norman Thomas Remick (""West Point:..Thomas Jefferson"") who said that Stephen Ambrose was the best, ever, at informing the public by making history interesting. ""Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson..."" is a great example of what this wonderful author and historian gave to America. He passed away this year. I hope someone comes along to fill his shoes (perhaps Mr. Remick?), because Stephen Ambrose shall, indeed, be missed."
2,"Wonderful story, but poorly told","The facts are there and the story could be so good, but Ambrose doesn't do it justice. No one comes alive in this book in spite of all the quotes and research. Additionally, Abrose's grammer is awful. Reading this book may be more exhausting and frustrating than the expedition was!"
2,Unfinished and Unsatisfying,"This book has an unpleasant surprise ending, which I am giving as a spoiler hoping it will save someone else some money. I knew the outline of the story and knew of Lewis' tragic early death. But after that, the book just ends. Hello? What about Clark? He lived a long time after. What of the other men on the expedition? What of York, the slave? What of Sacagawea? The book leaves so many loose ends that it is maddening. A shame since the rest of the book is an excellent read. Maybe Ambrose's family will issue a revision that gives the complete history."
2,Really Disappointing.,"I've read Ambrose's other works, like D-Day, and loved it. The problem with this book is that it seems, simply, written for and by a simpleton. The prose, which perhaps was meant to be elegantly spare, instead leaves you with a kind of ""yeah, so?"" reaction. One of the few books I've actually had to give up on. I just couldn't take it."
2,Very disappointing,"The voyage of Lewis & Clark is no doubt fascinating. But this book is little more than a rehash of Lewis's notebooks by an adoring fan. We hear over and over how brilliant Lewis was, while the actual events demonstrate that repeatedly it was only the good will of the Indians he ran into that prevented him and his quite large expedition from being slaughtered. The book does not add much to our understanding of the time, the period or the man."
3,acceptable intro to lewis and clark but not great writing,"I read this book on the recommendation of a friend, because I was interested in this aspect of American history, and knew nothing about it.If you are hungry for accounts of Lewis and Clark, go ahead and read it. The drawbacks of the book are not so serious that you'll regret having read it. (I don't know the L and C literature, so perhaps it's the best available.)If you like an intelligent writing style and solid scholarship, you'll be disappointed. Furthermore, I found Ambrose's attempts at interpretation to be pretty weak, occasionally laughable. (This may seem harsh, but others seem to unaccountably fawn over the guy.) See the review entitled ""A dissenting opinion"" for more details on the weaknesses of the book."
4,Better than a textbook,"It's not easy to bring this kind of historic tale to life, yet this one is better than most. It seems one of those ""everything you ever wanted to know and then some"" works. Great study material, but not light reading."
5,Undaunted Courage - best Corps of discovery Research Tool,"I read Undaunted Courage twice and pored over its fine maps before physically travelling the Lewis and Clark trail in preparation for my recently published book, Yazoo Mingo. Of course, a researcher must also scour The Journal of Lewis and Clark edited by Bernard De Voto but a reader may safely choose to obtain the important facts and information about the Corps of Discovery from Ambrose's highly readable prose rather than from the badly misspelled and often hum-drum log notations of the Captains. Undaunted Courage is the 800 pound gorilla of Lewis and Clark literature. However, I also recommend Lewis and Clark Among the Indians by James P. Ronda, Bison Books, for additional insight into the influence of First Nations on the expedition."
3,A for content; C for writing,"If my history teacher had graded this book, she nodoubt would have reminded us that we cannotforget good writing when we leave English class.The content was fascinating, but the style wasturgid and boring. Ironically, Anbrose criticizesLewis' writing in a sentence that is 8 1/2 lineslong!I learned a lot about the times in which Lewislived, but what was surprisingly weak was thesense of wonder at themagnificent discoveries the expedition made.This was especially surprising in light ofAmbrose's personal interest in the outdoors.It was an interesting book, but why is everyoneraving"
4,"Good, not great.","This is a nicely told narrative of the journey of Lewis & Clark, including both the preparations prior to their departure and their lives after they returned from the Pacific. It is lengthy, trying to blend the adventure with the politics and the economics, and in places it gets quite speculative, such as when it attempts to surmise the cause of Lewis's untimely death (I'm trying not to give anything away here).Anyway, as with all of Ambrose's work, it is what I think of as ""workmanlike"", always using a simple literary style that makes no pretensions intellectually. In point of fact, the author is a great story teller, and if you ever avail yourself of audiobooks (or 'books on tape'), his works lend themselves perfectly to that format."
4,Lewis and Clark,I love this book. It had been recommended by a friend. It is so interesting and I like the historical information about Thomas Jefferson much better than a biography that I had read about him. (Which spent so much time talking about Sally Henning) I am amazed by the amount of scientific data that was done on this journey.I'm not finished yet but am thoroughly enjoying this book. I wish the print weren't so small.
5,A fantastic story,I didn't know that much about Lewis & Clark and the Corps of Discovery before reading this book. WOW!Ambrose loved his topic and related it in such a way as to make you feel that you were there.
5,Spectacular retelling of a pivotal event in American history,"Stephen E. Ambrose scores again! Not simply a retelling of the adventures of Lewis and Clark. Ambrose tells the story of the Lewis and Clark expedition in its broad historical context and the principal protagonists - Thos. Jefferson, Merriwether Lewis, & William Clark - emerge as truly human figures; heroic, yes, but not without very human frailties. A fascinating read!"
3,Parents Beware!,"Parents, If you're looking for a good history book for your children to read, please beware.While Ambrose credibly presents the exploits of the Corps of Discovery, he also fails to resist the modern urge to talk about their sex lives. Descriptions of the men's sexual practices with the Mandan indian women and their varied venereal diseases are offered for our enlightenment. The author also regales us with the curious sexual rituals of the Mandans, themselves. In addition, for no particularly beneficial reason, Ambrose relates to us how cold the winter was by offering us the natural consequences to one who would chooose to relieve himself out-of-doors.Parental caution is advised."
2,Damaged New Book,"I purchased a ""new"" book. However, when I received it, there was damage to the front cover. It looks as though someone has bent the cover, and there is a visible fold."
1,A long long long long book,I had always been interested in Lewis and Clark but this book was just too much. This book had no real catch. I assume that it was pretty much accurate but there was nothing in it that made me want to turn the page. I had to physicaly force myself to get through it. In other words don't read this book unless you either are Lewis and Clark. ( I think that even they would fall asleep during this book) or your life depends on getting through it.
1,Ambrose is not credible,"Sad to say a person that has excited many people about history, me included, was not credible. Anything he has written has to be questioned. The man build his career off lying about his relationship with Dwight Eisenhower. He plagiarized who knows how many times. He isn't exactly known for getting it straight. Too bad that people continue to read his works and believe they are getting the facts. The publishers should at least point out that Stephen Ambrose was a fraud. I'm a bit upset because I wasted my time reading his work."
4,"Adventure,Adventure, Adventure!",Hollywood should read this book if it wants for high adventure! An amazing insight to the L&C expedition. It delves into the amazing bravery that these men took and looks at the troubled nature of Captain Lewis.
4,Undanted Review,"Solid Read, Ambrose illistrates Lewis's life, his relation to William Clark, and to yours truly, Thomas Jefferson. Tremendously well researched, and splendidly writen, the book informs the reader of the expedition, but more importantly, Lewis. With vivid accounts of indian interaction, the soil and necessary obervations, as well as the unknown wilderness, Ambrose creates a picture, almost painted in the readers mind.Fantastic!"
4,A book that made turning the next page fun,"I suppose I have never given proper credit to Lewis and Clark, or Thomas Jefferson, for the expansion of our country. I always looked at the whole event as just a back packing trip that we learned about in elementary school. Jefferson had a plan for the U.S., and it was to be that we would set our own course, not follow in another's path. In order not to follow in Europe's footsteps, the people had to band together and unite a continent as one strong nation. Ambrose did a brilliant job placing the reader right into the adventure. Reading this book reminded me of the frolicsome feeling that I got when I was a young boy reading Huck Finn. Each page filled my imagination and left me wondering how the next chapter would end."
3,It was on my reading list so I had no choice...,"I am a junior in high school and we were required to read this for our summer reading. The first five or six chapters were such a listing of facts that I seriously struggled to get through it. At that point, I barely even wanted to continue. Every moment of Meriwether's existence was pointed out to me, much more than I needed or wanted to know. It didn't have any flow to it, but it did get better once they got on their way. That part of the book was much better and more enjoyable, making history, which I find to be boring, almost fascinating and seemed easier to understand than something in a textbook. But other than the fact I had to read this book, I don't understand who would read this for fun."
1,Audio book to be avoided,"Most times I read a book, but there are certain projects I do that allow me to have an audio version playing. A man named Barett Whitener is alleged to be reading this book, however, there are hints that a lot of it is computer generated. I couldn't stand listening to this being read for ten minutes. I cannot imagine having to listen to the drone go on and on for hours. This is very disappointing, as Stephen E. Ambrose is an amazing writer with interesting material. To have his work reduced to this is an insult."
3,"This is interesting, but leaves something to be desired.","I think that this book is really interesting, but all it really seems to be is a large culmination of facts. It makes for an EXCELLENT piece of history, but I was looking for much more emotion and power when reading. I was continually waiting for someone in the story to get excited or upset about anything. It's pretty dry, but a very good piece of a history text."
2,"Too much hero worship, too little history","The book reads like a college term paper where the author had a requirement to submit x-number of pages. The book is impossible to really get into. There is little narrative and too much hero-worship. Hardly a paragraph goes by with out an ""Undoubtedly, Lewis would have..."", ""Knowing Lewis' character..."" or ""We can only assume that in light of Lewis' commitment...""If that's not bad enough, how many time do we have to hear that, given the detail of Lewis' journal for the pages we have, the missing time periods must be lost for surely Lewis would been consistent in his recordkeeping.This book should be about 30% shorter without the authors distracting ""commentary"""
3,Underestimates the reader's imagination and memory,"I was disappointed in this book, which I listened to on tape. It was terribly wordy, and took every opportunity to drum in the obvious or reiterate the dangers, deprivations, triumphs, etc. It seems to be a characteristic of popular histories to assume that the reader has no imagination and lots of time, and that fattened-up-by-repetion-or-too-much-detail is better. I did think that the information delivered was interesting and balanced. Still, the L & C expedition, as well as the lives of its participants and leaders, are interesting and inspiring enough not to need alot of commentary."
2,Too many editorials woven w/ facts,"I am having a hard time reading this book.. I become stressed. The author editorializes WAY too much. He also tends to analyze facts with a late 20th century perspective, rather than within the context of the time events occurred. Also, he should stay away from political analysis -- he is very weak in these areas (e.g.: Jefferson and Burr). May be a reflection of over-reliance on Merriweather/expedition-focused source documents. Or... Is it possible that the author is so enamoured with his subject that he lost a bit of the biographer/historian's [necessary] objectivity?"
3,It's okay.,"It's a good book. But it starts off with the history of Meriwether Lewis and his relationship with Thomas Jefferson. Which the cover says... I missed that. It does very little background on Clark. Once the actual expedition gets under way, which takes awhile, it starts off ok.. but becomes quite repetitious. Paddle up stream, make camp, meet indians, trade with indians, repeat. Since I was really only interested in the actual expedition the first part of the book bored me. And expedition itself, though extremely harrowing in person, just wasn't a super great read. It never really grabbed my attention. Historically this was a HUGE event. Definitely a major historical accomplishment..... I just don't think this was the best book on it. I may try to read another book on the subject."
5,Awesome story,"I got this for my husband for Christmas> He loves it! He listens to it driving to and from work--he says he doesn't want to get out of the car! He is a huge history buff esp the explorers and he said this audio book really portrayed ""how it was""."
5,Christmas Gift,My son requested this book for a Christmas gift and he was thrilled with it. The order was recieved quickly and the book was packaged securely.
3,Good but seriously flawed by political correctness,"Ambrose has written a well-researched retelling of Lewis's explorations that is seriously flawed by political correctness. This comes out in the second chapter when Ambrose takes a long aside to preach about the evils of slavery, the environmentally destructive farming practices of Virginia's gentry, and the plight of women in the late 1700's--none of which has anything to do with Lewis's later explorations. I can only think of a few reasons why Ambrose did this--one is so he could get the book on required class reading lists at PC colleges and universities that require that type of twaddle from authors, or he is an elitist and actually beleives this pandering garbage. It is too bad. Ambrose sticks in his little diatribes all through the book. If you can see your way past them to really learn about Lewis's explorations, it is a good read, but be prepared to have to thread your way through the PC flotsam. -Paul Foote"
5,Very factual and extremely interesting for anyone interested in early American History.,"After reading Undaunted Courage, my travels through the American West take on new understanding and become more interesting. It is difficult to travel through the area for any length of time at all without hearing familiar names from members of the Voyage of Discovery team. The names first made famous in this book went on to become famous on their own after the voyage was over. Many of the River Names and towns still in existence owe their fame to Lewis and Clark and their Voyage."
5,"History, Geography, Leadership, Science--It's all here!","I literally devoured Ambrose's tale of the Lewis and Clark expedition. While fascinating as an adventure tale, the story is equally compelling as an examination of leadership, determination, and courage."
5,Felt Like I Was There,"Despite seemingly tedious pages of details on how the voyage began, by the time the voyage began I felt like I was a party to the journey! For some weird reason, I really want to retrace the voyage and see what Lewis and Clark saw. This book gives the reader the unusual ability to both join in on the journey and appreciate the ""what ifs"", particularly during the Indian encounters. I thoroughly enjoyed this book."
5,A detailed account that puts you there!,"You can feel the cold, the wet , the hot, the bugs... You can smell the meat and hear the fat as it hits the fire. One of the most enjoyable books I've ever read. I've used this book to convice others to give history a chance but to no avail. I found this to be much more exciting and productive than any Clancy novel. My only complaint is that once I had finished I had a depressing realization of how lazy I am. Ambrose is a genius. On to Citizen Soldier."
2,For Hard Cores only.,"How one could make such fantastic source material so boring . . . . The research is fine, but should have been reduced by half; ex.,so many pages about delays of the boat being built.This is really the biography of Lewis. If interested in Sacagawea, or anyone else, you will be disappointed.Telltale in the introduction: ""We took turns enumerating the reasons we loved our country. We sang patriotic songs. We indulged ourselves in an outpouring of patriotism."" Just the facts, please."
5,This Book is invaluable.,Stephen Ambrose takes facts from his exhaustive research and writes what I call an amazing historical Novel that not only Informs but keeps you turning pages from the first to the last. It is a must have for history buffs and adventure seekers alike.
4,Undaunted Courage Review,"For a in-depth report on the opening of the west get this, it gives great information."
5,You've Never Been This Excitied About A Book ...,"I don't read history. Public schools cured me of that. But there was so much hoopla about this book when it came out, and there seemed to be such a high adventure factor involved, I bought it and read it. It is wonderful. A real page turner. I couldn't wait to get back to it when I put it down to work or sleep. So many amazing things. And they're all true."
3,"A Lengthy, Informative Voyage","Undaunted Courage is a tribute not only to the great mission of Lewis and Clark, but also to Ambrose's ability as both storyteller and researcher. This book made the entire experience of the Lewis and Clark Expedition (nearing it's 200th anniversary) come alive from the page. The tome is packed with excellent facts and background not only about the two adventurers themselves, but also about their aides, equipment, food and supplies, and the Indian cultures that they encountered. However, the book is, as a great many well-researched texts are, dry in many places and a good deal lengthier that it needs to be. In all, however, it paints a wholly accurate portrait of the great deeds and harrowing adventures that Lewis and Clark encountered, and their lives afterward."
4,Error on page 307!,"A highly readable and thorough account of the L&C expedition. I especially enjoyed the insight into Lewis' personality and character. However, I discovered a large oversight on page 307 of the paperback edition, when Ambrose speaks of the campsite called 'Fort Rock Camp', ""on the site of today's city named The Dalles, Washington"".....The Dalles is located in OREGON, not Washington!"
5,Fantastic book...I learned so much,This book is a must read for anyone interested in American history. The prose is well thought out and flows like a river. The book is fully referenced and footnoted in a reader friendly way. I am giving it to all my friends.
3,Interesting in spots but overall boring,"I have read a few of Steven Ambrose's earlier works. They held my attention through out. Somehow, this did not. Although Captains Lewis and Clark must have displayed great leadership and vision, it did not come through in the narration. I had to force myself to read through to its conclusion."
4,Undaunted Courage,The book arrived on time and in very good condition. A super bargain. The book is a great American story wonderfully told.
3,Interesting saga poorly told,"After finishing this book I felt almost like I had been on the expidition. I was tired, depressed and happy to be back. This book could have been many things, but mostly it is a prosaic account of the Lewis and CLark expedition that casts little illumination on the people and actions involved. I never found myself fully engaged in the story and never really got a feel for what it actually meant. Jefferson looms in the background but functions mostly as a bookend to the journey itself.I think I expected more perspective, and certainly more flair in the writing. In truth, I found myself nodding off frequently while reading this - not a good sign when one is reading about one of the great adventures of the 18th century."
3,Ambose does injustice to Meriwether Lewis,"Yes, Ambrose provides an entertaining romp through the era of the great Lewis and Clark Expedition. But he commits an awful disservice to readers (and Meriwether Lewis) by painting Lewis as a manic-depressive drug addict who committed suicide. I've read all of the available journals from the expedition, various bios on Lewis, and I've researched various archival material, so I know better than to believe Ambrose's opinion. Ambrose twists the truth, and he omits obviously important material from his book so that his opinion will seem to be fact. Some ""historian.""Did Lewis kill himself? The answer is currently unknowable. My best advice is to read Vardis Fisher's ""Suicide or Murder?"" If you can afford to buy and read the set of journals edited by Gary Moulton, you, too, will know better than Ambrose."
4,Eye opening study of a forgotten American hero,"Ambrose's study of Lewis was very instructive, in that it details a man's life, his many failings and achievements. Lewis never reached his potential, however, he acheieved more than most men would if they lived three lifetimes. Book should be read by all who are interested in the history of the United States and the price paid by individuals to create the nation we now know."
4,Undaunted Courage,"I was given this book as a gift by my future Father-in-Law who is a big Lewis & Clark fan. I started reading because...well he was my future father-in-law, come on! What I wasn't prepared for was the way in which Ambrose is able to project his love of Lewis & Clark and the Corps of Discovery onto the reader.Ambrose is able to skillfully blend the text of the original journals with his own prose in such a way as to keep you feeling a sense of dialogue within historical non-fiction.His descriptions of the sights that the expeditioners saw and excite the mind and inspire a person to want to follow the trail. If you ever thought that the Lewis & Clark journey was not worth much more than the paragraph it gets in most history books, you'll be pleasantly surprised and intrigued to find a lot more depth here.The book does slow down near the end, however. Once Lewis & Clark return to St. Louis from their amazing journey, the book becomes extremely anti-climactic."
3,"Fine Trip, Weak Payoff","This is a wonderfully researched book and well-executed as solid, novelistic nonfiction. But I had a problem: Ambrose didn't know how to build to the climax of reaching the Pacific. In fact, I had to go back a few pages to confirm that the ultimate destination had been reached! This was a shame, and I blame the editor as much as the writer for not structuring an effective denouement to an otherwise admirable work."
4,Lewis and Clark,"I found this book enlightening since it included a number of ""plates"" with relevant map information for the period of the travels. The author has put the details from many sources into the actual adventure that this became. I never understood the geographic limits of the Louisiana Purchase, and this exposes it with clarity. Good book."
4,Enjoyable!,"Excellent, easy read. Very enjoyable. Ambrose always tells a tell remarkably well and it's full of fun facts I was unaware of before now."
5,Lewis and Clark dork...,"A friend loaned me his copy...I finished it this morning at roughly 6 AM, and I'm now ordering a copy of Ambrose's amazing work. Jefferson's time in office/these events, being huge pieces of American history, weren't given enough attention when I was in school.. Jefferson, Lewis, Clark, et al - amazing people. Of course, this is an amazing story! For those scared of facts and figures, this doesn't read like a textbook. I'd say casual reading, but it's hard to put down. Buy the book, read it, and appreciate what people were able to overcome 200+ years ago the next time you're unsure what to pack for a trip to a place you've never been."
5,A Great Read,"Pure and simple, this highly-readable book is a great read, from cover to cover. I was shocked by the tragic last few chapters of Meriweather Lewis' demise -- a story that is certainly never taught in our grade schools! A mesmerizing tale of adventure and captivating enough for a beach book for anyone with even a marginal interest in American history."
3,Audio Tapes,"Don't buy the abridged audio version. It has four tapes, and the story is excellent. But one doesn't get to the homeward bound story until side B of tape 4. You know they've abridged it too much and there are many great stories that have been left out. Find an unabridged tapes of the story, it is too good to leave out a word. I felt cheated out of knowing what happened."
3,Fun Reading But Incomplete As History,"This is a biography of Lewis and not, as most assume, a history of the Lewis and Clark exploration. Ambrose himself goes to great length to point this out. One wonders if some reviewers caught on to this conspicuous difference. Undaunted Courage is worthwhile reading and a lot of fun. The best parts of the book focus on Lewis's Virginia roots, his relationship with Jefferson, and the leadership qualities of both Lewis and Clark during the expedition. The writer highlights the exceptional and worthy contributions Lewis made to natural science during their journey. Ambrose's treatment of the tragic decline of his subject toward suicide is balanced, thoughtful, and respectful. If there is a weakness to this book it is the familiar tendency of Ambrose to slip into slang to keep his material readable. Popular history has its trade-offs, I suppose.This biography might be disappointing to serious historians but won't disappoint the average reader."
2,An insult,"Too simplistic, patronizing and not very useful. The examples were not similar to the GRE questions I took."
1,30 days to GRE,"Terrible book - lot of mistakes, explanations are not clear - not recommendedspend little more money and get a better book"
4,Nice idea book,Seeing various ways to lay out workbenches is nice and this book fulfills that mission.
2,doesn't meet expectations,"Book gives a history of workbenches, some pictures and rough diagrams. It does not have detailed plans, and what it did have, I think you'd have to be really good at reading blueprints to understand. This was NOT a helpful book"
4,Excellent investment for those who need a quality workbench.,"This is a well-written & illustrated book for the indvidual who desires a quality workbench. There are options provided which should satisfy any reasonably serious artisan/woodworker. The steps provided are completely adequate for anyone capable of using the workbench selected. I built a bench which utilized a tail vise, bench dogs and face vise. I did not follow any plan provided by the author, but the information given allowed me to build the exact bench I wanted. If any shopper feels the book is ""pricey"", consider that if your time is worth at least $1.75/hour, this book will save you more than that in time. The jig for the bench dogs and tail vise plans were, by themselves, worth the investment."
5,Excellent book and well written,I have read this book and it is very clearly written...I had no idea workbenches could have so many designs and could be built with such care and detail. I am now looking into designing and building a workbench for my shop out of something other than Plywood and 2x4's...this book has inspired me!
5,"The be all, end all book on workbenches.","When I read Chris Schwartz's (I'm sure I spelled that wrong) book I thought it was the be all, end all book on the subject. But this was actually written first. It has more in depth information in my opinion. If you are thinking of building a bench, I would recommend this a first read (then Schwartz). It begins with a history of the workbench which I found very interesting. Then it examines various benches, and the function of different add ons (like planing stops, vises, etc.). It presents a smorgasbord of choices that you could add to your bench. Well researched. Recommended."
5,Heart Warming Pulp Adventure,"Tarzan at the Earth's Core by Burroughs is a heart warming tale of loyalty, romance, and adventure set in the hollow earth setting of Pellucidar. Like all of the other tales set in this world it is full of prehistoric creatures of the various periods and peopled by the most anachronistic cast of characters ever assembled. There are pirates, Vikings, cavemen, and intelligent apes as well as some wonderful made up races such as the evolved reptilian race that enjoy feasting on human flesh. Tarzan, of course, finds himself at home in the jungles of this world, and the supporting characters are heroic and delightful to become acquainted with. Even if you have never read a novel set in this world, a fan of pulp should do oneself a favor and pick this one up. It may not be the best place to start on your journey into hollow earth, but it is at least a start."
3,TARZAN AT THE EARTHS CORE,PAGES WERE VERY YELLOW MAKING IT HARDER TO READ.I have been an ERB fan since I was a kid in the 50s. I thought it was time to reread some of my old friends from way back when. This book had disapeared from my collection.
3,One of the more fast paced and narratively sound of ERB's books on Pellucidar,"unless you count the inexplicably underrated ""Back to the Stone Age"" which features his best and most colorful characters, compared to whom Tarzan seems a bit wooden, and a picaresque storyline which rivals Cervantes."
5,Networked Religion,"It used to be said that people sent prayers skyward. Now they use the internet. Heidi Campbell does an impressive job of showing how people find religion online and offline. And when people go online, religion changes. People are weaving together a variety of religious experiences. They're creating networked personal religion instead of belonging to only one denomination and congregation. This is an on-the-scene account, impressively combining reportage and theory."
5,Happy Happy Happy,"I love these hard to find shoes!! I've been a fan of these shoes since I was in high school 20 years ago and I still love the way they fit. Even though they are quite a bit harder to find these days, the quest is worth it. I have never found another shoe as comfortable even though there is no arch support, they fit like a glove."
5,Awesome Memphis Praise and Worship,"You can hear the Memphis sound influencing the entire CD. It has wonderful worship songs that I will be singing in my hoe, with my kids and at my church! Love ""Amazed""! Highly anointed words and music! The song come from an independent record label in Memphis...I am AMAZED!"
1,Not as described.,I did not get what I ordered.According to the person I contacted they no longer carry the following:Kimono MAXX CondomsThe Legend Bigger ONE CondomsAtlas Extra Large CondomsVivid Large CondomsContempo Mega CondomsWhat I got instead was quite different.http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v206/jkd003/IMG_2637.jpgThe company ignored me after I asked for a refund and I had to deal with amazon. I got my money back and I'm pleased Amazon took care of things but I'm posting this review as a warning to others.
1,Most Likely To Leak,"Length:: 0:35 MinsBought four buckets a year ago to use as diaper pails. Less than a year later, 3 out of 4 sprung leaks in the same exact spot. Video shows the spot where they leaked marked with yellow paint."
5,Amazing sink,"We love this sink. I wanted to do something different in our new home in the main floor bath so I chose this sink. We paired it with the Pfister Jadia faucet and even though it took forever to find the the required spout reach was 5"" for this sink. The faucet we chose has no problems at a 4"" reach. As long as there is good pressure 4"" reach is perfect. We set in granite and its beautiful ."
3,Love the look... finish is wearing near the drain,"I love the look of his sink, but the finish is beginning to wear around the drain, and we've only had it for a year. We have never used harsh cleaning products on it."
2,British law,I was a bit disappointed in this set. I enjoy British movies but this guy has too many personal problems that seem to show up more than the law.
4,Great Mask,This mask is gentle enough to be used daily. It gives my skin a nice healthy glow. A very good product for the money. I will continue to use this mask.
4,Good product,"It is really helpful to calm down your skin, hydrating and smooth. My skin is very sensitive, but this product really works well. Highly recommend to refrigerate it."
4,Sting my mouth area...,"I bought this because I saw it is ultra-soothing and super moisturizering masque. I used it after using the mud pore-cleaning mask to reduce the irritation and hydration. However, I found this super-mild gel stings area around my mouth. Ache lasted 2 min then went fine.... I am not sensitive skin.The description says it can't cause any irritation so I suspect this product is a fake.... I don't know."
1,Awful,"This DVD is dated 2007 but is as old as the hills. Not only that, it is performed in a studio without an audience and has a ""dead"", lacklustre feel. Described as a ""gorgeous production"" one can think only that the writer of the blurb doesn't know the difference between ""gorgeous"" and ""garish"". Keep your money in your pocket."
4,The King is Back,"King and the band come back with a strong release in 2000. He has one of the better backing bands on this release, although the second guitarist(Glenn Drover) is only adequate in the solo department. For that matter, Andy doesn't cut loose like he used to on the guitar, but is still good.As for the songs, they are all very good, but things really kick in from Black Devil until the end of the album. King's voice is still fairly strong, and it is nice to hear some true metal again."
5,Even after 15 years....,"This album is great! The king out did him self- beleive it or not. One thing REALLY changed this album, and it was the fact that there are some clean guitar parts played with the distorted guitar parts, and gives it a flowing atmosphere. Rarely has the king done this except for Conspiracy. LaRoque is hot on this one, and the writing is quite progressive for the regular KD style. The solos on this album have life and vibrancy, and THANK GOD its not keyboard dominted like his last three efforts. Not every song is in 4/4 time, as this helps the relativly simple story line ( quite a unique one too, i might add). If you dig thrash, or KD go get it...it'll rock you!"
2,king?,"Amazingly enough there hasn't been a review for this cd. C'mon now you King D fans... I bought this because I like some Mercyful Fate (his prior band) and went to see the ""King"" on his tour for this album. I have listened to it a few times in the years I have owned it and haven't been impressed with it. It doesn't grab you like Fate's ""Melissa"" or ""Don't Break The Oath"" which I have listened to numerous times. Maybe the lyrics are good. I really don't know. The music was enough to decide this one for me. Very average to say the most. FYI, his subject matter here is something to that of the recent popular novel by Dan Brown, The DaVinci Code."
4,Brutal yet very tasty...,"Great mood setter. I love the intro.Ahh, the King's sodomization of ""God.""This is an epic record and is INCREDIBLE!King Diamond's vocal talent shines with wonderful effect.His vocals are very melodic, 'Queen'-ish at times, and strong.For me the album is more mainstream in terms of the harmonies and the polish on the production. Some older King fans may not like it though."
1,King Diamond/ House of God,"This is by far the worst thing I've heard from King Diamond. It sounds like he wrote the lyrics before hearing the music, and tried to jam them in with no care for rhythm or space. I've been a huge fan since Don't Break the Oath. I own every release including singles. I'm not afraid to say that I think he seriously lost his touch this time around.In case he reads this, sorry King."
4,King tries to summon the past.....,"This album isn't quite as guitar heavy as Voodoo, but the song writing is the best since ""The Eye"", and King does some unique layering with his vocals that just has to be heard to be explained. The guitar riffs are much more in the classic metal vein than the speed/thrash style evident on his previous album. Overall, this is a solid album and shows the king still has what it takes to keep it going!"
4,The KING returns!,"OK, This is not the greatest KING DIAMOND release, but it is far from the worst. ""House Of God"" has a much more ""rock"" sound on the album, especially due to the drums. This is very melodic and also very catchy. Lyric wise King sticks to his story theme, which is very enjoyable. If you are a King Diamond fan you will enjoy this like any other King album, if you are a new fan go buy ""Abigail"" or ""Fatal Portrait"" first, then get this!"
4,"""The Trees have Eyes!""","""House of God"" has to be the most ""Fate"" influenced Diamond album since ""Fatal Portrait"". It's one of the roughest sounding Diamond opus, thanks to Kol Marshall helping to squeeze some new life into both Diamond and Fate. I always thought of King Diamond as Heavy Metal meets Broadway. Any of King's epics could easily be played and performed, with a big budget and hydraulic moving sets, on the big stage. ""House of God"" also happens to be one of the most evil Diamond albums. King also explores more into some other afterlife immortals, just like Fate's ""Last Rites"". King Diamond certainly might not be for everybody, but to put simply, there is no one like King Diamond, or what he does. Kudos to the rest of the band,as well."
4,Don't look for God here.,"A fan of King Diamond & Mercyful Fate since Melissa shrieked it's way into the heavy metal genre in the early 80's. The Trees Have Eyes & Black Devil are unmistakably characteristic of Diamond, and are my own personal favorites from this CD. With respect the enormous amount of talent involved in the creation of this latest work, it seems more like a Mercyful Fate album. Don't Break the Oath to 9 deal more with the devil, evil, and Hell, while Diamond's storylines i.e. Spider's Lulaby and Voodoo are tuned along the lines of horror and insanity (although, many don't see the distinction). Four stars simply because I liked the albums mentioned in comparison better than House, but it's worth the money, and like most KD/MF, it's an acquired taste (even with each new release)."
3,King Diamond is slacking,"This CD has the classic Kind Diamond format to it. It has an very good storyline to it and the first few song are fairly strong. As the story progresses, the songs become very weak as if he ran out of musical ideas. The CD is definetley worth purchasing but is not his best work. A true King Diamond fan will enjoy it regardless, as i do!"
4,Finally!,"Overall, this is a very good CD. The story is quite interesting, if not somewhat blasphemous. In my opinion, this is the only the worthwhile CD he has recorded in 13 years since 1987's ""Abigail"". The others are subpar or average at best. Maybe he is spread too thin writing for two separate bands. Highly recommended if you liked ""Abigail""."
4,Another solid album-4.5,"The King is back! Good creepy story and a more 'rockish' sound which is okay with me! If you are a King fan you won't be disappointed, hey with Andy laroque how could you be? Bang thy head!"
5,One of my favorites,"I just got the new cd ""House of God"" and it ROCKS! I loved it. Scary as hell with great melodies. I have never been disappointed by any of his earlier releases and this one stands out as one on my favorites."
4,"Love the color, but","The color is great for a neutral background, but it's very hard to edit to look uniform. Shadows appear easily, and a set of pics is hard to look uniform because any slight change in light alters the color a lot in the photo. Either way, I love it, and it's one of my staple colors for seamless."
4,Cool but not too cool,"I think this is a must have for ozz fans. The only problem is, why the hell do they change shots a hundred times a second? This gets really annoying. Zakk uses like 5 guitars in one song. Can the editor make up his mind. At least stay in the same show for a song or so. Dry ozzy, wet ozzy, shirtless ozzy, clothed ozzy, it gets so annoying. Oh well, i gave it 4 stars cause its ozzy, but i really hate the editing."
2,annoyed,"This DVD was a slap to real Ozzy/Zakk fans.I felt like the producer was targeting 13 year-olds, with the cheesy MTV-type editing antics.Plus, the ""acting"" was cringe worthy and painful to watch.The female concert goers were filmed like they were making a t&a; Ratt video. I also don't want to look at the drunk audience.I want to hear the music without watching this DVD. So I am getting the Live & Loud CD.They should have kept the camera filming ONE concert AND focused on Ozzy and the band."
3,Could have been a lot better.,This DVD could have been a lot better because there are tons of concert footage shown during every song. There is so much that you see Zak Wylde change guitars in the middle of a song but still be playing. You also see Ozzy clothes change in the middle of a song as well. This happens during most of the DVD. It degrades the quality when a director makes a video and uses footage from different concerts like this. There an appearance from the other three original members of Black Sabbath at the end. The audio is fine and is in Dolby Stereo and Surround. If you don't mind the constant guitar and clothes changes or just listen to DVDs then this is for you.
3,bad editing of a good concert,"The concert is great, but the editing is terrible. You hear Ozzy singing but he's not moving his lips. You never really see a camera angle for more than 2 seconds. You see shots of the audience more than the band! I want to see Ozzy and his band playing for more than a few seconds at a time. Compare to the Eagles, Queen, or Fleetwood Mac videos. Much more tasteful editing."
2,Video Collection,"I wouldn't call this a live concert, but rather a collection of individual videos using multiple live performances. Rarely did what you saw on screen match what was being heard. Don't buy this expecting to see a good live show. Also, the DVD is 2 sided for a video that's less than 2 hours, meaning that you have to flip it over halfway through it. I was expecting a lot more than this."
3,.....,"ok im a fan of ozzy and that DVD desapoint me because i want to see zakk wylde doing hes solos and stuff and only 2 or 3 songs you can see him doing a part of a solo, some times you see him playing another song.In song like ""Paraniod""(they put the camara zoom in and zoom out like a 100 times) and ""Flying high again"" (they put this video that it have nothing to do with the song) thats the side of zakk wylde but for ozzy you can see him perfectly talking to the audiense and tomy aldrige you can see him pretty good too.well if you are looking ozzy's DVDs you really should buy ""speak of the devil""!i hope this review helps... :)"
3,No guitar or drum solos,"I bought the VHS version when this first came out. Then my girlfriend bought me the DVD version. I was so happy until I watched it and noticed they took out the guitar and drum solos, which are on the VHS. Why???"
3,a must have,"If you love Ozzy (and Zakk), you must buy this one,if the many concert shots doesn't disturb you.It's a real Ozzy show. Less Zakk."
2,"After watching the DVD, you can't see what the players play","It is not good , If you want to see how players play . It combined many different concerts in every song. And when ZAKK solos , the screen usually shows other people. It's so bad for a guitar player. Just buy CD ."
1,No Randy available so who cares.,"Until a DVD is released with footage from the Randy Rhodes era I could care less about ANYTHING else that's released on OZZY. There may be a good song here and there (& not to bash Zack, Jake E. & whoever else) but to me Ozzy without Randy is irrelevant. This, of course, excludes Sabbath. I have a VHS of the ""After Hours show"", excellent video but only mono sound, so I would LOVE a professional 5.1 or 6.1 release of it. I also have several bootleg concert VHSs and in at least one of them (Japan - Budokan I think) professional cameras can be seen. So the footage is out there.Ozzy...what's the problem??"
2,wheres the zakk?,"being a huge zakk wylde fan I was hoping to see some blisteringsolo spots but I was dissapointed.This video is a mismash of what appears to be atleast 2 shows spliced together.very unfair to the viewer,zaks total exposure combined is like 5 minutes.if ya want good zakk pick up live at budakon(however in the later ozzy is pretty spent)"
1,Ozzy a no talent sell out!,"Ozzy Osbourne didn't even make most of the music or even write his lyrics. This concert video portrays Ozzy at his dumbest. Ozzy is the real life Homer Simpson, but annoying instead of funny. Ozzy's voice is shrill, flat, off key and bad. The only reason it doesn't sound too ear bursting on the video is because Sharon insisted that Ozzy re-record and do voice overs in the studio.I agree with the other guy who stated that Ozzy is not to be given the credit for starting metal. Ronnie James Dio was playing in bands, recording, and in the music industry way before Ozzy was. Ronnie James Dio is an actual composer and musician...Zack Wyld is a good guitarist but he is no where near as great as Randy Rhodes or Jake E lee. This video portrays Zack flaunting his long girly hair and hamming up the concert..."
1,Terrible DVD!,"I LOVE Ozzy Osbourne.He is awesome live.He has one of the best stage presences in metal.But this DVD is not a real concert.What this is the music from the Live and Loud CD played in the background played over a bunch of crappy video footage.Half of it doesn't even belong here.The music is great,but the video footage is what messes this up.If you want a real Ozzy concert,buy ""Live At Budokan"".If you want to get the REAL concert this was taken from,buy the CD.Also,The DVD does NOT have instant chapter access like the case says so.Plus,the DVD is two sided.This means that you have to flip it over in the middle of the concert."
3,"Great music, but.........","I would agree with most of the other reviewers, the footage is crappy (especially ""Paraniod""). The bottom line is this is Ozzy and anything from him is good. The disc is double sided and it does actually have a menu and instant track access ( on my remote I just press the menu button while the disc is playing). The best song/footage on here is ""Black Sabbath"", but it's still bad. I usually put the disc in, switch the TV off and enjoy the music. It gets 3 stars only because Ozzy is on here. Die hard Ozzy fans can ""waste"" their money (like me), otherwise- DON'T BUY!!!!!!!"
2,Save your money,"I am a huge Ozzy fan and an even bigger Randy Rhoads fan and I really don't want to say something bad about an Ozzy product. However, on this one I must. First off, don't buy this expecting it to be a real concert. The footage is spliced together and if you watch what Zakk is playing, often times it is clearly not the same song. There is too much audience in this dvd and I truly don't believe that the T 'n' A footage throughout was appropriate. Expected in a Poison dvd but not in an Ozzy dvd. Also, the video shown during Flying High Again, which consisted mostly of crude audience footage, was downright disrespectful to Randy Rhoads. Very disappointed."
1,WHY DID OZZY LET THIS TURD OF A VIDEO OUT?,"holy crap!! this sucks!! the music was great,as always,but the video blows goats!! got so dizzy ,thought i was gonna hurl,dont waste yer dough on this crap,get the cd instead."
3,no its not,the only wiccan spell book you will ever need that is a large statement and wrong. It has great resources and very good information and spells you can never say its the only book; learning never stops.a good book
5,a good book,This book arrived in a timely fashion; it was in excellent condition. I have no complaints.
1,not what i was expecting.,this book is a waste of time.i wanted to return it but the seller offered me half of the money to keep it.it was just not what i was expecting there has to be better books than this.wouldnt recommend.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,this book is a complet joke do not buy this it wont teach you crap about what you wanna do it didnt me the only thing this book is good for is fire wood. not only is it not the only book you'll need it has the most crap spells ive ever seen i dont wont to make some safty soup i wanna summon a demon lol
2,There are others....,"I own this book...it is comprehensive but, if you are very new to the Wiccan path it is good, but it isn't what the title cracked up to be. I believe the author was in a whimsical mood when she wrote the title so literally in this case...do not judge a book by it's cover."
4,Very helpful book,This is a great book for ritual guidance. I've used it numerous times to aid in my own magick. A really good reference.
4,Good for starters.,Its very basic you don't need to read the hole thing you can just scim through it. i like the part with creativity spells.
4,HIGH PRIEST,"I RECENTLY PURCHASED THIS BOOK AND I WOULD HAVE TO SAY IT IS WRITTEN WELL AND THE INFORMATION IS HELPFUL, IT IS A BOOK THAT EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE ON THEIR BOOKSHELF AND THE SPELLS ARE EASY TO DO. THEREFORE PURCHASE ONE."
4,Surprisingly good book,"I had to read this for a class I took, so I wasn't anticipating reading it. However, it turned out to be interesting. For those of you who wonder what it's like working in a car assembly plant, this is for you. It's even better that it's from a woman's point of view. Really hits home now that the Big 3 are going through such bad times."
2,Wish the inside had a lining in them..,"There is no lining inside the shoe and it rubs funny, I will have to wear socks with these which is not what I wanted to do. They are cute and comfortable and I would have rated them higher if it weren't for the socks thing."
5,This book changed the way I interact with my dog.,"This book is excellent, I recommend it to all my friends. It opened by eyes and showed me the world through my dog's. Well written, humorous, easy to understand and VERY informative. The author seems to truely care about the quality of the relationship that people have with their canine companions."
2,Not worth the read,"I've read several dog behavior books and worked with dogs for years. This book, however, was disappointing. He begins with the assumption that most dogs owners not only don't know how to train a dog, but actually seriously mistreat their dogs. He presents techniques in two veins. Some involve scaring the dog into doing the right thing by throwing things at him/her or by making a loud noise. Others are reasonable, positive, reward-based strategies, but he presents them as if it were some great, original idea that no one had ever thought of before. There are plenty of much better dog behavior/training books out there that are much better reads."
4,Interesting,"These are basically thick, black, dress socks with a split toe. They are sort of comfy but its just like wearing dress socks around the house...kinda odd, ya know. When you put them on, the stitching sounds like its about to give. They have to be stretched out to your foot size before they'll properly fit you. Worth the money? Eeeeeeh....why not? Just don't expect anything marvelous."
2,These shrink in the wash,"If you use a washer/dryer, beware that these shrink. If you want to line dry them, that might work.Also, it would be nice if there were a mark/tag or something to indicate which is left and which is right."
4,Black Japanese tabi socks,"They fit a little too tight around the toe- and I have skinny feet. otherwise they do the job, I wish they had tabby socks that went higher than your ankle."
2,Good but not the right advertisement,"These are dress socks, not normal socks. they are good but i was looking for regular socks. it was quite the price to pay for such a small mistake."
5,Very satisfied,"I was skeptical about the strips. But it works fine with my glucose meter.Box looks little old, but the strip is just as original.I recomend this."
5,very good,Wonderful and very quick service. Got it in only a few days. The money I saved was worth the wait.
5,Wonderful Book by Caroline B. Cooney,"Christina is a 13 year old girl who has gone to Maine from her homeland island to stay with the evil Shevvington's who manage to take over people's minds. She tries her best to fight back but fails to save Anya's sanity. The Shevvington's have the power to turn her own parents against her and seem innocent the entire time. Christina is the only one who knows and believes that they're evil . This is the first book in the series of three (the other two are The Fire and The Snow).I personally thought that this was a very suspensful and page turning book. Nowadays it's hard to find books as good as that with out the nonsense. This was honestly one of the best books I have ever read. I know that I'm defenitly going to read the other two, probably multiple times. So, if you want a good read then read The Fog by Caroline B. Cooney."
4,something creepy in the fog....,"Christina is thrilled. She's spent her entire life on Burning Fog Island, off the coast of Maine. With an extremely small population, the island only has an elementary school. Once the kids reach Junior High, they are sent to live on the mainland and go to a normal school. It's finally Christina's turn! She is going to live with the Shevvingtons, the principle and his wife. Anya, Michael and Benjamin are also returning, in older grades. Once they get there, Christina senses something is wrong. Anya, the island's prodigy, is acting weird. She is having nightmares, waking up screaming that the ocean wants her...she's having eerie visions, and sleepwalking. Christina is terrified. She knows something evil is happening, and she thinks its the Shevvingtons. There's something sinister happening....but no one believes her! Whats happening to Christina?"
1,DON'T READ THIS BOOK,This is the wrost book I have ever read. I can't believe Cooney even wrote this. Do not waste your time or money on this book.
3,Eerie Fog,"Caroline B. Cooney has a certain eerieness to Fog. The book grabs you in the first chapters and relates you to the main character, Christina. While following the life of an island girl named Christina on her first year attending school on the mainland of Maine, the author reveals an evil in her boarding house. This evil does not come from an usual source but, rather, the warm caring arms of her boarders and also her administraters at school. Christina is in a frantic struggle to overcome all odds and break the hold they have on her friend, Anya, as well as on her community. This novel, written for young adults, has a sense of suspence that keeps the young reader interested. It has fancinated me and I can't wait to read its sequal Snow."
2,The Killing Fog,"It took me three weeks to actually finish this book, cover to cover, and boy am I sorry I did. The book was not that bad, but it was, surely, not to my liking. I think this book was just excruciatingly boring. The whole theme of the book is just horrible. The fact that the fog was actually talking to a girl and making her suicidal is just beyond childish. I would not recommend this book to anyone who can even read. Make sure you pass the word!"
1,well...,"i was poking around looking for a new book for face on the milk carton, not being satisified with the last one, and i found these reviews...i only got half way through this book b/c i was soooooo bored by it, or just confused...i have all three too...it's a shame...and i love caroline b. cooney too-becca"
4,Yes It is Coarse,"Wanted a grater that would be good for grating ginger, this is not the one. It is really coarse. But is really sharp and does a good job on cheeses and other things that one would want a coarse grate on. Comes with a guard, great idea to protect the user and the sharpness of the grater. Really like the stainless steel construction. But does have some nooks and crannies. So get that toothbrush out to make sure and keep it clean."
5,"Very sharp, watch your fingers or the kiddies.","We had the Microplane rasp grater for a couple of years now and really liked it compared to ""normal"" graters. However, the rasp was a bit fine for hard cheeses sometime, and did not work real well for ginger (it excels in zesting fruits and grating nutmeg for baking). So we recently bought these two graters (this one and the coarse). They work great (mind the pun).The coarse is good for ginger and hard cheeses. The extra coarse is good for softer cheeses, like cheddar and mozzarella. The length and width of the grater is appropriate for grating over a pizza or skillet. The thoughtful touch is the rubber on the helper bar at the end. That lets you place the grater on a counter without too much slippage while grating.The graters a substantially sharper than ""normal"" graters, for better or worse. Mind yourself with these (or letting kids use them). I slipped with on and sheared the tip of my finger off (albeit cleanly).Good product, worth the money."
4,Pretty Good Gadjet,"Bought this after using the MP fine zester for two years. Sharp blade as described and it is perfect for grating cheese on pizzas and soup, but I knocked one star off because the grated ingredients are not exactly extra course... it is more like a medium course.Other than that, a handy tool for those who enjoy cooking and this will make you feel very ""chefy"" while cooking and entertaining!!!!"
5,Wonderful grater,"Now I can finally discard our 25-year old grater, which until we got the Microplane grater, had not been surpassed by any previous replacement candidates. This grater is incredibly sharp and does a wonderful job with cheddar cheese and other such items."
4,Grater is outstanding!,"When I was tired of cleaning my box grater after only using 1 or 2 of the sides I always use, it was time to look for a replacement or a new way to get this job done.And thank you Amazon for leading me to this grater. First off, it's made by a company that makes planes for wood. Compared to that, cheese should grate like soft butter.Pros:-sharp and grates easily (I've used this on cheese, carrots, ginger, baking chocolate, etc)-solid build-easy to clean-stores flat in a drawer-plastic cover is still going strong after 1 yearCons:-when something like cheese gets really small, it can be challenging to grate and you should watch the fingers.Overall, I'm very happy with this grater and have since purchased the 2-sided ribbon one!"
