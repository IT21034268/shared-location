2,Arthur's Eyes by Justina,"Arthur's Eyes was a good example of how your treated when you look different from others. Although everyone is the same and equal, and thats how the teacher treated Arthur,equally."
1,Disappointed,"This book has absolutely horrible artwork in it. I bought my copy through the school system, and on the cover, they had a picture of Arthur like he looks on the TV show. However, inside the book, Arthur and his family look like rats, not like teddy bears. My kid couldn't even recognize the characters. He kept saying that this wasn't Arthur. I hope all the Arthur books aren't this shoddy, but I hestitate to buy another without flipping through it at a store. It literally looks like a child drew the pictures."
1,Misleading graphics,"If you look at the cover, it shows the current Arthur. INSIDE the book is the, I am guessing, first generation arthur that really looks like an aardvark. The crude pictures inside are confusing to the child. Avoid this arthur book and move on the the next one."
4,Helping Yourself With ESP,I was eager to read this book because I am aware I have some abilities and I wanted to get some information to clarify how to use my gifts. The book was easy to read and I am having fun putting the book into practice.Helping Yourself With ESP
4,Give it a go!,"Not a very popular book it seems, but is definitely funny. I would recommend it to anyone who needs a laugh, or just to get an interesting perspective of middle class life today. A good, easy read!"
5,"AMAZING, LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!!!","This is so far best diet product on the market. real pure hoodia gordonii, Ive been using it for a year now, LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!!!after reaching my weight loss goal I am still using it to stay away from junkie, helps great! Hoodoba is my #1 diet product. You have to try it to believe it."
4,Does work,I've been using for about 2 weeks and I have lost 6 pounds. This product really does cut your appetite.
2,Sorry to say I was disappointed,"After researching for months, these pills came up as the most reliable and effective. I decided to give it a try and finished the whole bottle. But even when I took the pills exactly as directed (and with plenty of water), I am sad to say they had absolutely no impact on my hunger. I know everyone's body is different, but I just get a bit suspicious with some of the reviews on here because according to these testimonials, it either works like a miracle or does nothing at all...Plus, at the price, it's about $50 every 10 days, which I guess I couldn't afford in the long term anyway.Either way, I gave it 2 stars because even though the pills did nothing for me, the company itself is extremely professional."
1,Waste of Money,"Bought 3 bottles of the 750mg Hoodoba Pure. I have been taking 2 capsules/3 times/day for 10 days and note absolutely NO effect. No change in appetite, and no additional weight loss. (I am also following a low fat diet). Don't waste your money!"
5,Greatest......also unreleased music,"I don't usually write for anything or about about anything, but cannot hold back on this one. Best I have ever heard, makes you cry when you hear it, just wonderful. Makes you remember the past, and how great it really was. In this world of things changing so fast, he is like a rock. And all the released tracks for this, is worth the price alone. If you are a John lover as I, add this today, you WILL not be sorry........"
3,Stereo SACD: No Multichannel,"This is a great performance. My review is mostly based on the fact that this is a stereo SACD, not multichannel. I am learning more about SACD every day, but was very disappointed that it is only presented in stereo."
4,Out of the schemes,"The author analizes with high lucidity the meaning of sense and object of sense (all senses). His tendency is to simplify other people approaches and bring the whole subject down to the essence. This is the perfect book for an out-of-the-schemes analytic phylosophy reading. Easy to read, direct, full of examples, with a pristine style and a perfect structure. Follows a thread and helps the reader hanging to the topic. A lot has been written about the weight of this book in twentieth century analytic phylosophy; yet it is a very specialistic book, it tackles a very specific subject and entails a dialogue with other analytical thinkers. It is, in other words, a work for the specialists that has had the privilege of winning the attention of a larger audience.Recommended book for people who already have had an introduction to analytic phylosophy."
3,Fret Buzz is overwhelming,"What a pretty guitar. What a good price. What a terrible buzzing noise coming from the low E string. Yowser. It's like listening to a bass. Very hard to ignore.But, it's pretty. That's all that matters after a while, right? Us beginners give up after a month or so and just let it sit there. So, being pretty is a huge bonus.I digress.The guitar sounds nice, it's sturdy (heavy, too), easy to tune (doesn't fall out of tune as bad as some reviewers claim, for me at least).I recommend this as long as you don't care about the buzz. I care and it's hard to ignore, even though I can't play more than about 3 chords right now. That buzz put me off so bad that I gave up faster than my husband--he's still rolling."
2,Low quality,You get what you pay for. It won't stay in tune and only tunes in large increments. Also feels like a heavy chunk of plastic. What can I expect for $120.
5,Perfect for the price,Great guitar for the money! This starter guitar will last and has a great sound. Bridge is a little finicky and you have to get it just right to eliminate buzzy strings.
4,Epiphone Special II,"The guitar arrived ahead of schedule so that was awesome. The bad part is there's a chip on the side of the fretboard by the low E string by the nut. That really bothers me. Also, the bumper sticker was stuck to part of the packaging so it's now no good. Other than that the set up was pretty good and the intonation was surprisingly good. Of course the white color is awesome!"
4,Sinatra on Capitol,I prefer Sinatra during his Capitol years. His voice and orchestrations are superb. A must have for a Sinatra collector.
4,Living the backpacker's dream,"Jason Elliott lives the backpacker's dream in Afghanistan, with adventures both harrowing and humorous. This does not represent a one-time trip around the country, however; Elliott has lived a years-long love affair with Afghanistan, making multiple trips into the country and meeting many unusual people along the way. After you get past wondering how his parents could have let him spend that first summer in a war zone, you'll be grateful for the layered perspective of memory and observation he builds throughout the book."
2,an unexpected boredom at the end of the day,"Being a keen reader of almost everything that I've found about this terrible and fascinating country, I bought this book and the reviews on the back and front covers made me expect a great read. But after having reached the last 100 pages, it unexpectedly ended up falling from my hands, and so far I have not had the desire or the willpower to finish it. All the 1 star reviews in Amazon are worth reading before you give a try to this long, pretentious and boring travelogue. However, there are a few passable moments, as can only be expected in over 500 pages dealing with Afghanistan. In the end, an unsuccessful attempt."
4,Read this if interested in Afghanistan or off-beaten path,"This was really a memorable book. I have to thank Jason Elliott for being such a brave person and entering this very different and sometimes hostile place. His descriptions of the land, architecture and people are all very well done and his curiosity seems to know no bounds. Much better than his other book about Iran because he doesn't focus as much on architecture."
4,Unexpected Light,"Sane, sympathetic and trustworthy exploration of a difficult subject. Mr Hotte, whose review is above, is NOT to be trusted. He's a bit picky, isn't he?"
1,"Tedious, Boring","A valiant effort, but this book has to be one of the worst travelogues I have ever read. Elliot seems to want to place himself among the ranks of the Thesigers, Starks, et al, and fails miserably. To give him some credit, there were several passages that were really worth reading. But overall, it really was NOT worth the effort! I got about halfway through, and gave up. Thank heaven I had saved the receipt, and that the bookstore took it back! Never again!..."
4,Unexpectedly Pleasant,"As you come to the end of Mr. Elliot's book you feel like you have been with him traveling to what may as well have been the moon.After having ventured out to Afghanistan shortly after leaving school at the age of 19 back in the early 80's Jason found himself joining the Afghan resistance in an assult against a Russian position in Kubul.Mr. Elliot describes his journey back to Afghanistan almost 10 years after.This is his first book.He is very informative on America's roll with the Taleban, Afghan culture, and the way the country runs it's self dispite poverty and guns everywhere.I didn't think he used good logic comparing Christians and Muslems, but it was a great read."
4,Beyond typical analysis,A great book that made me think beyond the realm of typical ecological and social analysses.
3,Not quite up to standard,"Ahhh... Rumpole is back! I was delighted to see a new collection of short stories written by John Mortimer, even though Leo McKern had sadly passed away. However, this new collection is not quite up to the standards of Mortimer's other short stories. Perhaps it's because it's been six years since ""Rumpole and the Angel of Death."" These new stories feel a little off, like a poet trying to emulate another poet's works; it's close, but doesn't feel like the same old works. ""Rumpole Rests his Case"" isn't a terrible book, but it's not the best one of the series."
5,Absolutely Fantastic,"I was an early adopter and have used this phone now for a few years. It has literally saved me over $25,000 in personal call phone charges when overseas. The Uniden equipment is top notch, the software is stable, sound quality is perfect (95% land line) and customer support for some minor issues was adequate. I also have the 800 number in the USA, and it also works great. This phone and service has been fantastic (especially for the price)and I recommend it to anyone that makes lots of long distance calls."
1,"Worthless, won't work on DSL","I purchased one of these online from Ice Monkey dot com but it was the generic version not the dedicated Packet8 version. However, I ended up sending it back because it would not work at all. I tried it with 2 Qwest DSL modems, an Actiontec GT704-WG on an ADSL network and with an Actiontec Q1000 on a 20Mb VDSL network. The problem was the phone's Ethernet port would not connect with either of the DSL modems, the light for the port would not come on, it wasn't recognized and it wouldn't do anything. If the device is not recognized as being connected to one of the Ethernet ports there is nothing else you can do and it's dead in the water. I found that I could connect an Aastra VOIP phone or a SunRocket VOIP adapter made by InnoMedia in place of this phone and they both worked perfectly so I know there was nothing wrong at my end. I'm going to go with the InnoMedia VOIP adapter and a standard Uniden cordless phone."
1,Right product - Wrong version,"I cannot really rate this product because what I thought I was ordering was for Vonage and not for Packet 8 service.I was rather peaved at Amazon because when I did a Google search for the model I thought I wanted, the UIP1868V and saw a link with a good price on the Amazon site, the UIP1868P came up. I did not realize that the phone also had a Packet 8 version because I did not know there was such a service.The phone was shipped by Tiger Direct and to their credit, the took the phone back and gave me a full refund."
1,This phone needs a special phone service,"When I bought the phone, I had reviewed so many others and didn't realize that you need a special phone service in order for the phone to work. I had to return the phone to the company, paid $24.00 for shipping (both ways) and had to pay a 20% restocking fee. So, I waisted about $40+ for nothing.I can't rate the phone itself b/c I never used it."
2,Skip It,"Not even ardent Mel fans will want to bother with this album. In fact, the more devoted a Mel fan you are, the more you'll dislike it. Trivial to awful mid-60s arrangements with mediocre performances by all concerned. Dreadful from start to finish."
2,This harvest moon fan was sorry she bought it.,"Okay, if you've played lots of other harvest moon games before...maybe you should skip buying this one, and wait for the newest installment for DS coming out in June.The controlls are confusing to figure out, and the beginning story and music you will hear during the games are VERY cheesy. Like, 'I couldn't stand it and had to turn it off' cheesy.I liked Wonderful Life for Gamecube much better. Magical Melody tries to be kinda like Friends of Mineral Town, which I've already played, so I was looking for new imporvements in the game! The improvements weren't enough to maintain my interest in this one. Yah, you earn music notes, but you earn a music note just for FALLING DOWN. Like I said, I was unimpressed."
4,stop whining!,"If you think this game is hard you obviously aren't very...adaptive. Have you ever played animal crossing? tried to upgradeyour house? trust me thats alot harder then gettin the barn inthis game so stop whining!... wimps. oh, well this game is great, personaly I like the 'kiddie' graphics better then the'realistic' graphics.I love the 64 version and this version better then the 'realitic' version... the a wonderful life sucked anyway. Oh well besides the 'challenge' of getting the barn this game gets a 4.5!"
3,Harvest Moon Magical Melody,"This game is horrible. The graphics are not at all as realistic as the wonderful life games. The characters are ugly, and although it sounds like so much fun, its a bore. My sister and I both agreed that its stupid. My sister CRYS when she looks at the character because she has pigtails and she claims she looks like a ""five year old"". DO NOT waste your money, if you do, I'm sure you'll be posting a review with the same message as mine."
4,"Great Graphics, Great Gameplay-Great Game","I agree with pretty much all the oher people who wrote they're reviews and their storlines. I rated this game 5 in fun because new things are always happening- you can fish, take care of animals, build friendships,[or even marry them if you earn enough hearts 0=]harvest things, ride a horse, explore town, shop, plant plants, and so much more.Overall, I rated this game a 4 for perticular gamers. They may not have the time and are one of those people who play the game to finish it fast. This is not the type of game you can finish in a week. Also, some people like things with lots of action and fighting; which Harvest Moon doesn't really offer. Personally, I don't think Harvest Moon needs any fighting like that but...ah well.As long as you have time and are o.k. with getting addicted to this game, I highly recommend it."
4,Love This Game!,"This Game is so much fun! I love it! While there are a few things that I would change about this if I could, they are minor and don't deminish the game at all. In my opinion this is the Best Harvest Moon I've played yet."
2,Hard!!!,When I bought the Harvest moon magical melody I was really excited. But after playing it for about 10 min. I got frustraited and traded it in. For this game was a huge let down compared to Wonderful Life harvest moon. For the controls were harder and I kept getting lost.juiceapple
4,Great Game,"This game has alot of extra stuff that the previous Harvest Moon doesn't. There are more festivals, the seasons go by quickly, and there is more to do. All in all you get what you paid for :)."
5,Harvest Moon Magical Melody is the BEST!,I think Harvest Moon Magical Melody is the BEST HARVEST MOON GAME EVER! It was the 3 Harvest Moon game I ever got and its still my favorite Harvest Moon game. I think it is the perfect blend of easy and hard. The only flaw is that it is very hard to marry Jammie.
3,"Excited at first, but that didn't last long.","The game was something I use to play when I was younger so I thought to buy it and have some fun. But once i received it, I actually got bored of it pretty quick. But I did receive it sooner than expected and for that I say the shipping speed was amazing. But overall ended up playing for maybe not even a week and now haven't touched it since."
3,Love Harvest Moon!,"When I found out I could play Game Cube games on my Wii I instantly went in search for another Harvest Moon game. Well let me tell ya, not only did I need to buy the game but I also needed a new remote and a memory card which is especially hard to find since Game Cube memory cards seemed to have disappeared from the universe. Luckily I already had the remote I needed but now I'm continuously restarting the game every time I play since I don't have a memory card."
3,Harvest Moon,"This game was bought for a friend of mine, he is very happy and heenjoy this game. I like buy by internet and this shop is very good."
2,okay,I just start playing it. It's alittle more complicated than the other Harvest moons. One thing I dont like: At first you can store more than 5 things in your rucksack. You dont have the option to move the camera angle around to see where your going. You will get lost quick. You see when you play it. I will continue to play... Also you have a tired meter and you can revive youself by eating or sleeping. If you do too much and food is not around you will faint and end up in the docs offices. It;s fun once you know what your doing.
2,a little disappointed,"i have been wanting this game for a long time and have read a lot of reviews on how great it is, so i finally bought it. yet once i started playing, i'll admit, i was a little disappointed! it is harder to figure out than i was expecting, i'm no gamer, but still, i thought it would be pretty easy. so i get frustrated more often than i have fun with the game. hopefully this will change if i ever get the hang of it!"
5,It Rocx!,"This game is the best iv'e ever heard of, Im already married and have a baby! I luv the lake cave, it gets me rich. When it came out im like ""OH MY GOD,ITS FINNALY OUT!"" i was so exited. DUDES GO OUT AND BUY IT!!!"
2,ADDICTING.............BUT HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Even though all the other Harvest Moon games are great, this one, however, is not good at all.It's addicting,I'll admitt that, but the graphics are horrible and very hard to accomplish. I've had this game for about three days, and i'm not even a quarter of the way through with it. True, it has a good story line to it, but not my first choice. If I was you, I'd stick with the first ones."
2,"Very difficult, kinda disappointed with this game...","I thought I would actually like this game. I ordered it and got it, and when I went to go play it, I was very disappointed. It's really hard to play and it takes forever just to get through the introduction of the game. If I had known all of this I would have definitely saved my money!"
5,Love it!,"Had the 4600/1Ghz/256/30Gig/DVD/CDRW for about 3 months. Love everything about it. The monitor, keyboard, mouse, network card, modem, CDRW all work flawlesslly. Replaced W98 with Win2k Pro without a hitch. It's fast with a big, bright screen and all the features. Can't really complain about anything."
3,Much smaller than advertised,"The glass beaker was broken when I received the cafetiere even though it was very well packed. The seller, CSN, was wonderful -- I received a refund within 24 hours of reporting the breakage.The reason I asked for a refund instead of a replacement was because the cafetiere is much smaller than advertised - 5""H x 2.75"" diameter, only 15 ounces, slightly less than 2 cups."
3,Does the job... with some grounds getting through. :o),"The glass is solid and sturdy, but the press pieces could be a bit better quality. The Bodum press pieces seem better! But - it works just fine! And for $20 bucks less... it's good."
1,Not happy,"The product works perfectly, however, it is advertised as a ""THREE CUP"" which it certainly is NOT. It produces ONE normal cup of coffee. If it was a 3 cupper, I'd rate it much higher."
4,Chupa's book is a benchmark work!,"Though this work is ten years old it is still on the cutting edge because there is so little work on stereotypes of whites in literature and on screen. Chupa actually describes white women as they are depicted by African American novelists. These images are seldon seen on screen because they are the women who matriculate in the Black community. Never-the-less the work is seminal. Furthermore, Chupa does an excellent job of delineating stereotypes from archetypes. The work is a bit difficult to read because there are some slight organizational problems, but the information is there if you are willing to look for it."
3,product is great -smell not great,This product really lathers great and works just as well on the hair as it does as a body wash........but I found the aroma of the product very faint and non lasting compared to other bath products I have used. I just ordered the Cinnamon Buns body lotion so I will see if this makes a difference in keeping the aroma going a little bit longer.
5,Smells Great,This is my favorite shower gel! Smells super sweet and lathers well.Wish the scent would last longer though.
5,Yummy!!,"Philosophy has always made great products and this is my ""christmas staple"" I buy the largest bottle I can find to get me through the winter months and my husband is thankful every year. If you love the cinnamon buns shampp/body wash/etc then pick up a stick of the lip gloss it truly is heaven."
4,Cinnamon Buns Body Wash-Very Nice!,"I was very happy with this product and the way it smelled. It doesn't overpower and smell like chemicals the way others can. It is light and creamy and although I don't use it as a shampoo, I like that I can get it on my hair and not worry that it might damage it. Very pleased and will be trying other scents as well!"
2,Not for me,I love the way it smells but it gave me a rash! I guess anything spicy just does not work for me. I ended up throwing it out.
3,little lasting fragrance,"i love the scent of this product however it did not last much past stepping put of the shower, also do not use this as shampoo if you color your hair-it strips the color out. it left my skin feeling soft and nice but i wish the scent lingered a little bit longer. i understand this is true of many philosophy products, i guess they dont want to have the shower gel compete with any perfume one might wear but i found it very disappointing. overall a good product if used as bubble bath or shower gel just dont expect the scent to last."
5,cinnamon buns,"Another in a line of products from Phylosophy. I have given many of these products to our employees, and drivers wives, they have all commented on how something so simple could leave such an impression. These make a fine gift, for an incentive, or just because.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002U4M4MQ/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
2,Could have been nice...,"This napkin holder would have been fine, except it arrived with a very visible chip out of the top -- that had been filled with PLASTIC WOOD! The filler was ugly, poorly applied, and coming out of the wood chip in chunks. I picked the remainder of it out with my fingernail and it looks better than it did with the filler in the chip.What kind of company ships a product poorly repaired with wood filler right on top?Probably should have returned it, but hey, it's only a napkin holder.Made in Taiwan, btw."
1,Hate it with the fire of a thousand suns,"I daydream about the day that we buy a new napkin holder. We purchased this at BB&B; about 5 years ago. The finish is nice and it's a nice neutral color.Otherwise - terrible. The napkins randomly come out in chunks of 10 or more. This problem is worse when there are only a few napkins left in the holder - sometimes pulling on one causes every napkin to come out with it. It doesn't seem to matter what brand of napkins I use. I can't believe that this product has such great reviews here. Yes, the napkins all stand up straight even when there's just a few left - but that seems like a cosmetic feature more than anything else. I just want one napkin to come out, every single time."
5,"Looks Great, Works Great","I am very happy with this purchase. It looks and feels like oak. It works well. One end can swivel inward, which holds the napkins in place. I wish I had this years ago."
5,A napkin holder!,Hey! It's a napkin holder! It holds napkins! I like the hinge; can hold various numbers of napkins without them falling over.
1,I was very disapointed in this item,"I purchased this napkin holder and when I received it, it was not packed in bubble wrap just a package and when I opened it up it was all in pieces. The wood was nice but I don't know how it was packaged not assembled! I returned it for a refund of which was smooth and trouble free! I was pleased with that aspect of the transaction. This could have just been a fluke, hopefully other holders will be just fine for you."
1,review for the 1957 Miserables with Gabin and Blier....,"...distributed by Unicorn Video. I have to be specific because somehow it seems that the Blier and the Ventura versions got mixed up. I love the movie, it is one of my favorites, but the DVD is absolutely horrible. It is in English only, you can barely hear it, and the video is not even VHS quality. I could not stand it and stopped the movie after the first maybe 15 minutes. There is no way I am keeping this garbage in my collection."
5,The Best movie of Les Misarables Ever.,"This is the best screen play of Les Miserables, I think if Victor Hugo's see this movie he would be pleased. If you like good movies don't miss this one."
2,Les miserables . Miserably translated....,Where is the french language version ? The english translation takes too much away from this great movie....should be the original french version with english subtitles...
1,Ignore all the other reviews!,"Apparently everyone is very confused about the different versions of Les Mis on video. I've never seen this one and so don't know anything about it, but the other two reviewers are confusing it with the production of a few years ago with Liam Neeson and Geoffrey Rush, which it most definitely is not! Check your dates people!"
1,This Movie was Awful!,"How can you people say this was a good movie. It is the worst version of Les Miserables that I have ever seen. I have read the book, seen the musical and watch two other movie versions other than this, this is by far the worst representation of Les Miserbles ever. Are this people supposed to be actors? Jean Gabin was a grumpy old man and would have done a better job as Ebenezer Scrooge than Jean Valjean. All of the actors were horrid the only one who was remotely torlerable was the bishop. Don't get this, you will be dissapointed."
5,Flynn leaves Bruce Lee standing,"This is the classic tale of Sherwood. There have been many Robin Hoods and this is the one that they show again and again on Saturday afternoon television and for good reason because it still manages to be good fun although the English is at times is almost incomprehensible to the point that native speakers may even find themselves turning on the subtitles :) Flynn moves fast in this one. He jumps and jacks about the place at such lightening speed as to make one wish he was around the time of Bruce Lee to standoff with him. Maybe call it ""Enter the Hood""? Sounds like something starring Enimem though."
4,"Robin Hood, the Original 1933","Older and cheesey so far as effects go, still absolutely THE best Robin Hood running. The remakes don't hold a candle to it for all their special effects.I got turned onto this by my mom and laughed at her, til I actually watched it.This man WAS Robin hood.. Buy it.. you won't regret it for a second."
5,"Classic, timeless fun!","My children sit riveted to this old movie. They simply love it. I had rented it a couple of times, and finally decided it was worth owning. I love the good old-fashioned values...no swearing, nudity, sexual innuendos, or gratuitous violence. Nothing for parents to worry about here! This version is colorized, fyi, for those children who might be black-and-white-phobic."
5,blu ray's best robin of the hood.,"The new version of Robin Hood (2010) was great, so are the many other versions out there but this is probably the best one. Errol Flynn really captures the spirit of the caharacter and Prince John soon to be King John is a villianous as can be imagined.The real king John was no coward but he was not a nice person by any standards and this version of Robin Hood is probably the most loved one. Thankfully they shot the movie in color and so on blu ray it just comes alive like I have never seen it do before. This classic movie has a allstar cast that stands the test of time too. But if you want this movie you need to own it on blu ray. Few movies have no one star reviews , This one's lowest rating is a four star! And every review is correct. This one will enthrall any viewer and it's so good that they don't need computer graphics to be as good as something made today."
5,Blu-ray Version is Gorgeous!,"What a treat to see one of my favorite movies much as it must have been seen back when it was first released! The level of detail is astonishing, but seemingly without any artificial edge enhancement...... and the color....... oh my, it's some of the most beautiful color I've seen in an older film...... bold and beautiful without being overly saturated. Also, the sound is wonderfully clean and clear!If you're a fan of this film, I'm sure you will enjoy this excellent transfer."
4,geart version of the Robin Hood Classic,I have always loved the Errol Flynn version of Robin Hood. This Blu-Ray edition was very well done. It was a pleasure to watch.
4,robin hood,I love this movie but it is a copy. faded out a bit. But not complaining. My kids enjoyed this old time movie
4,Still love it,"My 12 year old and I really enjoyed this movie together. Just like I used to with my Grandmother.I was looking for something action packed with a great story, but no gore. Perfect."
4,Blue Ray version of the Adventures of Robin Hood,I was very impressed with the color restoration of this film.It was like seeing a new film compared to what I remember from when I saw it in the past on tv. The extras are very good also.
5,Hero of all times!,You may keep Kevin Kostner and all the others - this is the real thing! Maybe somewhat aged after all these years - but still the best! Watch and enjoy together with the whole family!
5,Robin Hood (aka Errol Flynn),"I have watched this movie over and over again since I purchased the DVD some three years ago, and it still hasn't lost any of it's magic! The music/score, the actors, the action! Simply the best of the best! Warner Brothers pulled out all the stops for this one ladies and gentlemen! Get your copy - good at any price if you want to see a ""golden"" golden-age-of-hollywood movie! Five stars!!"
5,Excellent,"this is an excellent film, larger than life color, winner of three oscars, a great musical score. This is one of those movies they don't make anymore. Buy it, you won't regret it!"
4,Still a Good Movie,"I remember enjoying this movie as a little boy watching it on a black-and-white 13"" TV in Maryland. Years later as a young man it was ranked as a Top 25 guy movie in the Von Hoffman Bros.' Big Damn Book of Sheer Manliness. So when Errol Flynn's Robin Hood finally came out in DVD, I knew I had to get it. I was afraid, like other old movies and TV sitcoms, that the passage of time would not be gentle to Robin Hood. But the movie is a good as ever. Adding the cartoons is also a nice touch in the DVD extra. I'd give it 5 stars, but my idea of Robin Hood was changed forever after Archie Bunker said, ""Robin Hood was an English f*g."""
1,There is no advantage to the BD version!,"After receiving the disc I was very disappointed that this print looks exactly like the DVD/VHS versions. I really enjoy this story and have for many years. But BD expanded capabilities should have been used. Even though, as expected, the movie is 4:3 it doesn't appear that any effort was made to find the best print. This WHOLE thing, even extras, is just a copy from DVD/VHS versions. Some of the extras have no tie overall and in fact a few are just simply filler. The History of Robin Hood files is filmed 4:3 format in 1998. Clearly any film prior to 1953 should only be purchased on normal DVD. Between 1959 and 1960 one will have to see how it was shot, print used or extra content before purchasing a BD version. There's even a web page that won't open on BD live!I will continue to enjoy this film especially now I finally own it. But I will be very very skeptical in the future buying an old favorite on BD disc.[...]"
5,One of the best HD-DVDs you will ever buy.,"When Warner released the 2-disc Adventures of Robin Hood DVD, they justly received many accolades, and it ended up on a lot of reviewers ""best of the year"" lists.Why? First of all, the film is one of the most joyful and fun-filled movies ever made, and the best Robin Hood ever filmed. The 1938 technicolor classic was restored from its original elements, and looks absolutely pristine. The mono soundtrack was retained, as it should be.If only the restored film was on this disc, it would be a must-buy, but the extras put it WAY over the top. How about 3 Looney Toons classics in HD? How about the option to watch it ""Night at the Movies"" style, which includes newsreels and shorts that would be shown before it originally? How about documentaries on every step of the production, and even a Warner gag reel that was shown at their annual Xmas party? How about all of that in HD?Get it. Now. You won't regret it."
4,HD DVD review,"This is an old classic presented in full screen 1:33 ratio (original aspect ratio of this 1938 film). If you like old classic film in color and don't mind the full screen, you'll enjoy this film. The colors are surprisingly great for this almost 70 years old movie."
5,A wonderful classic.,"What a great movie. I just loved the story. This is a great movie for all true romantics. I like how back in those days the romances weren't vulgar. This movie is just full of; excitement, romance, humor, and adventure. It's so great that I want to watch this movie again and again."
5,Errol Flynn at his Best!,"At the height of the Golden Era of movies, Errol Flynn and Olivia DeHavilind were the perfect couple on screen. They made you feel the joy, hope and desperate times for England. Hope, love, romance. What more could you ask. It is a few minutes to suspend your disbelief and the movie will last in your memory for a lifetime. With the thousands of remakes of this great ""fairytale"", this one remains my favorite. Basil Rathbone is the perfect villain in Sir Guy and the sword work was jerky, but, hey filming was not a perfect science at that time. It was the triumph over tragedy and good over the evil, Prince John. History may not write these men as they are in this move, but, just watching Claude Rains as the Evil Prince John, makes it all worth while. They are the great actors whom Derek Jacobi and Sir Laurence were to be and they learned from the best. Love, Hope, Joy and the triumph over evil, with a ton of laughter in each line. Enjoy!"
1,wouldn't play,"I'm sure if you have an HD DVD player this DVD would be fine, but I ordered it not realizing that it was specifically for HD machines, amistake that could have been easily avoided if that was stated clearlyin the description of the product.I did find the DVD for regular machines but it's twice as much! Oh well, I'm ordering it anyway, cause I absolutely love this version of Robinhood!"
1,This DVD Doesn't Play,"Went to play this DVD, and it got half way through and just stopped. Then this error message popped up stating, ""Cannot play the disc, error code 408bc504."" I tried several times to restart, and the same thing happened. I would like to return it, please.Sincerely,Barbara E. Rogerson"
1,defective,"disc broke up and stopped in cut 13, about 45 minutes into the film. will have to return it."
1,The Adventures of Robin Hood,The Adventures of Robin Hood (Two-Disc Special Edition)I was very dissappointed. The first copy I received didn't play on any of my DVD players. They sent me a replacement and it didn't play either. I really love old movies and this is a good one.
5,Welcome to Sherwood!,"LOVE! LOVE! LOVE this movie and was so excited that it was available on AMAZON! It is an excellent story of Robin Hood, as opposed to all the newer versions, with lots of swashbuckling action and a damsel, not in distress but holding her own. And what can I say ... Errol Flynn is just suave and debonaire and looks great in tights!!"
5,The Greatest American Film,"Like any great work of art, this movie transcends the passage of time -- a storybook come to life, as one critic put it. Beautifully designed and photographed, perfectly acted, and magnificently scored, it's got everything a movie should have. A few years ago, I saw it in a revival theater and they read a letter from Olivia de Havilland in Paris, who said it had a special place in her heart for reasons that are obvious. Amen."
3,old films-good fun,"Love Errol Flynn. Always had a smile on his face. No gore and no upset stomach from watching an old "" action adventure"" film"
4,Classic Family Fun,"This is a wonderful classic adventure film, which can be enjoyed by the whole family despite the fact a number of persons meet their end by the sword or bow and arrows of Robin Hood. The action scenes are well staged but there is little in the way of blood spilled on the silver screen. Errol Flynn does a superb job of filling the role of the hero and the other actors are also well cast and rise to the occasion.As for my criticism, Robin seems a little too over confident at times during the situations he places himself in but I guess being familiar with the script helped Errol with this point. For someone who can split an arrow in half with his own from many yards away it is also difficult to believe that Robin could not recognize King Richard from a few feet away. Finally, some of the costumes seem more suited for a high school play.If you can overlook these latter points and just going along for the ride I am sure you will enjoy this film."
3,Idiots.,"This is not a comment on the film, which is (in my opinion) one of the ten best films ever made. And I cannot quibble with the fine job Warner Brothers did on the video and sound quality of this wonderful blu-ray disc. And all of the extras are really great, and there are hours of fine entertainment to be had by purchasing this movie. SO WHY DID SOME IDIOT PUT A PICTURE OF ERROL FLYNN FROM "" THE PRINCE AND THE PAUPER"" ON THE DISC ITSELF? That's right, a beardless Flynn from the 1937 film is the artwork some moron used to stamp the disc - check it out for yourself."
5,Good Movie,Always been one of my favorites. Glad I got a copy for myself.Watch it on holidays Family fave.Adventures of Robin Hood
4,Very good picture but no so good sound,"Very good picture but no so good sound,I d'nt notice there is a sound treatment on it, now a day there area lot of digital technics for reberding a new sound aspect, the image thanks to technicolor system ys verygood for me (I'm 70) this is the best version of the film, good scenarios, good lighting technics anda very appropriate team of actors, the only issue that d'nt matches the quality of the whole film is sound quality."
5,When night is falling....MY OWN REVIEW!,"I liked the movie. Especially the part wherein the professor is still in denial and she's trying to explore more her feelings towards this stranger. It's very intense. It doesn't involve too much of the sex part but each scene is very meaningful. Petra is a representation of a lesbian in the 90's era. She's not buff. She's very sexy. And she doesn't wear men's clothing. The whole story itself is very realistic that I don't even think that this movie is a fiction. I highly recommend it to women who are still not sure what there feelings are. I ordered this video because of the story. Both actresses are really good. I cried, I laughed so, on and so, forth."
5,Finally a realistic portrayal of two women in love!,"Visually stunning. This is a movie rich in symbolism. Make sure you watch it with someone who will make you look at the film a little differently. You can try it alone, but you'll regret not having a sounding board to bounce your thoughts off of. If you like this movie, try ""BOUND""."
2,Mediocre,"The only thing I can say about this movie is mediocre, it is most certainly not the worst story & play I have seen, but it also far from thrilling."
4,"Thelma and Louise, but without the guns","Probably 10 times I've watched this film. Each time I find myself falling in love with the both characters, they appear to have a chemistry I liken to Xena and Gabrielle. This is different though, as we only see this unfold in the course of a few weeks. The opening scene becomes very important, as we see Camille's inner desire, and when she kisses Petra for the first time, you can feel the excitement and utter fear of the realization of ones sexuality. That scene alone could foretell the final scene...What joy for a film of this genre to have a happy ending. Watch this movie with an open mind, admire the courage of accepting differences, and appreciate love...all love"
5,A beautiful movie on many levels,"The story of an unexpected romance between a female professor at a seminary, engaged to a male professor at the college, and an exotic female circus performer. The characters are richly developed. The allegories provide multiple layers. The story is refreshing, although I found the ending perhaps just a bit too tidy."
2,Shocked!,"I am completely shocked by the amount of 5 star reviews this movie's been getting. I just watched it, and thus this story develops in a ""circus environment"" (something I'm strongly attracked to), I somehow felt empty all along... The main characters have a strong role which I think is what most liked, but I just felt completely disconnected from them, and somehow couldn't manage to connect them to one another either.It seemed to me that they wanted to make the most out of the story with the least amount of time and budget and this is what came out. I think this could have been a great story / film if only the story ad been developed a little more carefully..."
5,the best lesbian romance I have ever seen!,"...and I have seen a few ;) This is definitely a beatifully told and enthralling story, that goes far beyond the usual lesbian-chic erotica. The setting and especially the soundtrack give you the feeling of being drawn into a time and place as far removed from ours as the stories Camille teaches and the depth of plot does not let you off as easily as most other movies I have seen - you don't know how it will turn out, you don't know if it will end well, and for a long time you don't even know how you want it to end. I head to re-watch it three times the night I rented it before I could make myself turn the TV off. Without a doubt *the* best movie I have ever seen. Five stars just doesn't describe this one!"
1,terrible story,"this movie is awful, the story line is just weird. I was disappointed in the acting and the movie as a whole"
4,Old favourite,I saw this film when it was released and loved it - not easy to find in most video stores though! 13 years later it is as good as I remembered. Just the right balance of romance and eroticism. A lovely film.
2,"ok, kinda all over the place for me","It was ok, a little creepy but still sexy. Wasnt into the circus thing. Very unrealistic as far as a catholic school teacher leaving with a circus performer"
3,When night is falling,This movie is okay. {romantic] Ilove romantic movies.I wish i had one to tell.Thats why i like these type of movies.So i can see what its like to fall in love.Ihave seen this movie quite a few times.
5,magical,"I love this film. It's up there with my favourites. It has an air of mystery and sensuality that it pulls off very well. I loved the storyline, the Sirkus of Sorts, the funny quotes added in. A favourite ""romantic/lovestory"" movie."
3,what about bob?,"this movie should have been titled ""what about bob II?"" it was pretty but jeez, get bob out of the refrigerator and off the kitchen table."
1,A Classic Love Story,"This in one of those Movies that you can watch over and over. I became a instant fan of Pascale Bussieres. I rerented it 3 times in 1995.""When Night is Falling"" is a Classic Love Story regardless of Sexual Orientation. Ms Bussieres is A really fine Actress. I saw this film years ago and bought the VHS from Amazon. Hopefully it will be rereleased on DVD. I have recently viewed her performance in ""Blue Butterfly"".She has retained both her beauth and her talents. I wish her continued success with her career."
3,Had Trouble Too But Called Number,"My Son, Lives and Breathes Bob the Builder. He was starting to hammer the walls and the furniture, so off the store I went to find a product that he could bang on instead. I was so excited when I found a Melissa and Doung product. Usually they are well built. But....After banging and banging and my husband banging and banging and still no balls going through I was very disgusted. Instead of taking it back to the store, we called the number on the back and they were extremely nice and apologetic. They sent another one right away, within a week. The second one worked fine and now we have two hammers and 8 balls!!!! My son loves pounding on it and I love the fact that only occasionally,do my walls and furniture get whacked! Their response made me love their products even more!"
5,My son LOVES this toy!,"I can understand the complaints about this toy. As it doesn't come with any directions, I was confused at first. But the balls are actually slightly different sizes with the yellow being the biggest - so it takes the most ""hits"" to get it through the bench. AT first, my son didn't take to it, but my husband and I would hammer the balls through and he'd just stack them in the holes. Then, after seeing us hit the balls through - he will now sit and pound on each ball until they go through. He loves it - and it keeps his attention for a long time, longer than most other toys.I think it's great for hand-eye coordination. But at first, it IS frustrating because some balls take a while to go through - hang in there. The whole bench does loosen up after used a few times.WONDERFUL TOY for the Money!!!!"
4,Great for the kids.,"I purchased this for my 18-month-old, and he loves it! Any kids who come over to play always pick this toy. The only thing I do not like is that the hammer comes unscrewed most of the time. And it is not as durable as I thought it would be. The paint has chipped on most of the balls, and the wooden base top is really dented. Besides those things, my son is learning his colors and is having a blast!"
2,Broke after a few uses...,"My ds had this toy. The little ""slide"" broke after the first few uses. We were very disappointed. It seems like most of our Melissa and Dough toys have broken. I bought a whole bunch of them for my ds, but since having my dd I have switched to higher quality wooden toys because although M&D toys are less expensive, they don't hold up. :("
4,2 generation users,"We purchased a pound and roll for our daughter 23 years ago. It survived to serve both of our sons. It is in the toy box for our granddaughter and is one of her favorite toys. It facililtates eye hand coordination and is an excellent anger management tool.As for the people that had difficulty with the balls being too hard to knock through, ... have they never heard of ""sandpaper""?A couple light wisk around the holes loosten them up to as loose as you prefer. I had to do that to a couple holes way back when.Last week I ordered a new ""pounder"" for my grand daughter's 2d birthday... sometimes she needs to bang on something when she's not at our house."
1,Piece of junk,"My son received this as a first birthday gift and it lasted about a day. I wouldn't consider him an aggressive baby or even iron man but this toy only took about two whacks from the hammer and it cracked in about 5 places and started coming apart in pieces. I returned it and found the plastic Fisher Price version which is hard to find, it's not made anymore, but you can find it on Ebay or in resale shops. It's well worth the search because this toy does not hold up."
2,this toy is not age appropriate,"I thought my twin boys (15 months) would enjoy this toy as they love beating on pots and pans and I thought they would like the cause and effect aspect of this toy. However, it takes so much force to move the balls through the holes that they quickly became frustrated and lost interest in the toy altogether. Even my husband has a hard time moving the balls through the holes-he has to beat on it full force about ten times before they go through! I think the toy is good in theory but your little one would have to have the strength of Hercules to enjoy this."
1,Poor Design!,"I bought this for my 14 month old. I figured that it may take a few tries, but he would be able to hit the ball through the holes. After trying this myself, I regretted buying it immediately. I myself got so frustrated trying to get the ball hammered through the holes, I had to put it away. As for the comment about the sandpaper, we tried it and it doesn't work because it's the size of the inside plastic ring that controls the size of the holes and that cannot be altered. If you remove the ring, the balls just fall through. I consider this a useless toy and would not recommend it."
5,The Freshmen at their best,"What a great choice of tunes. No doubt, this is the freshmen at their best. What harmony! Best Jazz and Pop vocal group of all time (the four guys on the cover of this album). There are many favorites to pick from, in this group of songs."
5,delisciously melodic lyrical strummings,"This man has a voice to swoon, and his lyrics are exquisitly sincere, open and infused with a tender rawness."
1,"Bret Dennen, Tiny Tim for with a better producer?",The muzak at work has been cycling several Bret Dennen songs. That voice becomes increasingly annoying with every play. Kind of a modern day Tiny Tim with better music and production values.
5,Poetic,"DO NOT HESITATE to buy this album. This record is a reminder of what music could be, inspiring, heart-warming, fun, and poetic. This album will stay in your CD player for weeks straight. A CLASSIC!"
4,Eye-relief,"Not much of an update over the 2004 edition. The colour plates are nice, and the bigger print is easier to read than the tiny print used in my 2003 edition. I own several French dictionaries and have found the Larousse Advanced the best for not only defining words but for providing examples of how those words are used in a variety of contexts. The sample sentences are often delightful springboards to other useful words to add to one's vocabulary. Highly recommended if you're passionate about French."
3,Small,"I purchased this product for my 4 pound Chihuahua. He barely fits. It is long enough, but not nearly as deep as I thought it would be. It is very difficult to use. It is now sitting in the closet."
5,Indispensable Book on GOLDFINGER,"This book has been exhaustively researched and it shows. This must have been a real labor of love for the author, Adrian Turner. This is the one film that really spawned the world of James Bond to the general public. It left an endearing quality on many of us and this book is a tribute to that whole unforgettable era."
4,A perfect gift for a five-year-old,"I bought this set for my son'e 5th birthday. He absolutely loved it and was determined to go through some of the difficulties of building a set as complicated as this one. After he built it, he put it on a table and appreciated it. Sometimes he could sit by the fire station set for about a whole hour to do his imaginary play."
5,Still as good as ever.,"I had Legos when I was young, so now that my son is 6, it's his turn. I gave all mine away to another youngster when I was in high school (who then gave them to his younger brother--they last forever), so I have to buy new ones. These are every bit as good as the ones I had over 20 years ago. My son already wants more to add to his set. I guess he'll have to wait for his birthday to see what he gets. I only wish Lego would put more drawings of other ways to build the sets. I always liked doing the instruction set first, then trying to copy the pictures. Great for the imagination."
5,Lego City Fire Station,My son absolutely loved the Lego City Fire Station. I had a blast helping with it as well. I highly recommend this set it was a wonderful experience for me and my kids.LEGO City Fire Station
2,Dull coming-of-age story...,"Bill Albert's ""Desert Blues"" tells the story of a 16 year old named Harold back in 1955. He is orphaned by a car accident, and has to live with his ""square"" aunt Enid. Suffice to say, Enid isn't that glad to have Harold around; she's afraid her lover Archie won't like Harold. Added to the mix is the sudden reappearence of Enid's father(and Harold's grandfather) Abe, who is dying. Harold learns some things about himself, but everyone in the novel is frankly unlikable and dull. Albert doesn't help things by making us want to yell at Enid. All in all, at less than 200 pages, it is brief enough, but it is a dull way to pass an afternoon"
3,Shift Knob,I was very impressed with the package and design. It was very egornomic and look well with the rest of my leather interior but it wasn't as durable as i thought it would have been since the leather began to peel after while of handling. For the price i expected alittle more than that.
2,Eh,"I bought this because someone gave me the apple cider scent, which I LOVE. I smelled their chocolate and it was good too, so I figured why not strawberry milkshake? Doesn't smell like a strawberry milkshake. I'll stick to the apple cider"
2,Won't buy it again,I bought this product mostly because it was a 3-in-1 and who doesn't like the smell of a strawberry milkshake? Anyway does not smell like a strawberry milkshake to me so I probably won't buy it again.
5,Body wash/shampoo,"I love these since they are shampoo and body wash, it doesn't give me dandruff as other shampoos. It also smells great. It is also a great 2 in 1 product."
3,Pretty good.,Not the best shampoo ever and the smell isn't what I thought it would be. Very water melon-y.Didn't help my hair.Not that great for bath bubbles.The smell doesn't stay on your skin for too long. (If you use is as a body wash.)It's okay.
4,If only the cuts were longer!!!!!,"The photographers did a really great job. But the editing...The shots are too damn short!!The individual cuts in this video are soooooooo beautiful, they'll make you want to see more. Unfortunately, most shots last only a few seconds.Great video anyway. They even have a shotlist on their web site...Good reference for your next trip to paradise."
4,relaxing at home,I bought this video to watch while on my tread mill it did not really suit my need for that. However it is the most beautiful sceanic video set to soothing music a nice escape. good preface for anyone going to the islands.
1,"Waste of Money, Lack of Information","Good thing I was able to return this book. Way too short and provided lack of important information. Much of the text can be researched online and most of their ideas are common sense. The Appendix they provided are weak. The web sites provide little to zero of help. If you really want to learn more about this kind of business, ask directing to the manufacture."
3,Short but good primer,"This book is very short, but it has some good information for the beginner who is contemplating the process of starting a business in this field. But this will not offer much to anyone who has thoroughly researched the field themselves.It does not give you any information about what products to offer, where to get them, or who to sell them to. But it does give real world examples of how various people in the field have approached issues that arose."
2,I was so disappointed!!! Not at all what I had expected...,"From the information I read prior to purchase, I inferred that I would learn how to edit spreadsheets I received from others, at least to reformat them. On the back cover, it says: ""And you'll get easy-to-spot explanations of how to share worksheets..."" I still haven't spotted these explanations.Also, to me, a book called, ""...for Dummies"" implied simplicity. This book seemed too advanced for the title."
2,what a disappointment!,Elvis on Tour is a terrible DVD! Most of the movie is on a 3 image screen and very distracting. Who cares about anyone but Elvis? Did the backup singers or band produce this because it sure looks like they want to be center stage. Very disappointing; would like to return it.
4,Elvis Fan,"This is the release from the movie limited engagement in Aug and Sept 2010. Elvis on Tour is over 90 min long and shows behind the sceens never released before. Some interesting, some funny. Overall, it is a must for any collector. I enjoyed it with 25 songs from his different concerts."
4,Worth buying and watching.,"I think it is worth purchasing, the only thing I was disapointed with is that when he went to another state or city on the tour he did not say where he was playing his concert at. I have been trying to find a list of all the places he played at and when he was there. I was hoping this tour would have told me more of where he played. I am glad I added this DVD to my collection!"
5,Elvis On Tour...at last!,"Elvis on Tour is the last Elvis film to be released officially on DVD! Was it worth the wait?, well naturally if you are and Elvis fan, of course it is. The original film in 1972 was shot on 16mm film, so its never been seen as sharp as say ""Elvis, Thats The Way It Is"". However this is proberly the best you will ever see of Elvis On Tour! One sour note however, is that due to copy right reasons, the opening song sequence of ""Johnnie Be Good"", has been replaced by a loop of ""Don't Be Cruel"" which is dreadful!"
3,Could be better,I received the product on time. My only concern is about the quality. For a documentary that has taken so long to be on DVD the sound and image should have been better.
3,Elvis Blu-ray,"Don't bother buying the Blu-ray. Whilst it is entertainining, if you have a quality led and sound system, you will not get the full advantage. Buy the DVD as the blu-ray is in 3:4 ratio and has not been upgraded to 5.1. Very disappointed Elvis forever fan. Come one guys, lets get into the next century. LED Zepplin did it - why can't you???"
5,ELVIS IS TRULY THE KING,ELVIS IS EASILY THE MOST INCREDIBLE SINGER AND ENTERTAINER WHO EVER LIVED.HE LOVES HIS FANS AND HE TRULY LOVES PERFORMING FOR THEM.I LOVE ELVIS VERY MUCH.
5,ELVIS AT THE TOP OF HIS GAME,"ELVIS PRESLEY SHOWS HIS GREAT SHOWMANSHIP IN THIS CONCERT FILM FROM 1972. THE FILM FEATURES IBTERVIEWS AND LIVE PERFORMANCES OF"" SEE SEE RIDER "", "" LOVE ME TENDER "", "" A BIG HUNK O' LOVE "","" BURNING LOVE "", "" LAWDY, MISS CLAWDY "", "" POLK SALAD ANNIE "","" CAN'T HELP FALLING IN LOVE "", "" YOU GAVE ME A MOUNTAIN "","" PROUD MARY "", "" BRIDGE OVER TROUBLED WATER "", "" AN AMERICAN TRILOGY "" AND MORE. IT ALSO FEATURES CLIPS OF THE ELVIS OF THE '50S'. THIS TAPE SHOWS ELVIS IN REHEARSALS AND IN JAM SESSIONS AS WELL. IT'S AN EXCELLENT TAPE WITH MANY SPLIT - SCREEN IMAGES THAT WERE WAY AHEAD OF THEIR TIME IN 1972. THIAS IS ELVIS'S SHINING HOUR. BUY IT TODAY ! """
4,Elvis on Tour,"This documentary shows Elvis as he starts to go down a destructive path. You can sense in certain scenes that his health is in decline. It gives a ""behind the scenes"" feel as to what life on tour with Elvis was like. He sings great and looks cool as only he can."
5,Review of Elvis On Tour,"The only thing that could improve this documentary/movie would be its digital transfer from VHS to DVD.Like Elvis himself this documentary is; wholly unique, multi-faceted, thought provoking, filled with great music, an exciting confirmation that Elvis was the greatest entertainer of all time.Elvis on Tour [VHS]"
3,Dissapointed,"I own the original VHS of Elvis On Tour and when I saw the DVD I was dissapointed. First, the editing. Three full minutes of the film were taken out. Second: NO EXTRA FOOTAGE. I thought this film was going to get ""deluxe treatment"" that the Aloha From Hawaii and This Is Elvis got when released back in 2004. There were times where a line appeared right in the middle of the screen. The new edition simply did not live up to my expectations. I wanted the original version PLUS extra footage. All I got was a barebones version that was below the level of greatness of the original. After waiting for so long for the release of EOT on dvd I, as a fan and customer was dissapointed."
3,They lost Johnny B Goode,Sad to read that they took out Johnny B Goode of the opening credits.They are looping a live version of Don't be cruel.Elvis on tour will never be the same.How can Warner ruin this so badly.I am still in doubt whether to buy this new version or wait another 20 years for a proper COMPLETE version.
3,SICK ening......DO NOT BUY!!,BIG MISTAKE IF THEY THOUGHT ELVIS FANS WOULD'NT NOTICE THE OPENING OF THIS DVD WAS TAMPERED WITH - JOHNNY B GOODE.I JUST LEARNED THE OPENING THEME MUSIC OF 2001 WAS TAMPERED WITH ALSO AND REPLACED.WISHED I HAD READ THESE REVIEWS FIRST BEFORE BUYING. ELVIS FANS - STOP PLAYING WARNER BROTHERS AND EPE's GAMES AND LETTING THEM MILK MORE MONEY THAN THEY DESERVE FROM US. DO NOT BUY ANY MORE PRODUCTS UNITL THEY GIVE US WHAT WE WANT AND DO IT RIGHT-- THE FIRST TIME OUT!
2,WARNER AGAIN,"Packaching its ok, but sound bad. DTS? NOT. 5.1, The sound of this release dont dtshd, lies.Image well but no quality blu ray."
2,A HUGE Disappointment!,"As a lifelong fan, I am very disappointed with this release. After waiting years for this DVD, I find that I would rather watch the VHS version. Johnny B. Goode has been removed from the opening credits, and if you have watched this film as I have for the past 30 years, this is more than a minor annoyance. Also, the song that replaced it is poorly edited. There are no extra features. The worst crime of all, however is the concert audio. Elvis sounds like he's in a hallway. The only saving grace here is the picture quality. Maybe there will be a ""Special Edition"" release sometime in the future, to milk the fans' hard earned money yet again. With all the extra footage out there (and some was even officially released in the Lost Performances video) you would think they would do the king justice and show his fans some respect by making this a movie worth waiting for. Sadly, this is not the case."
4,Truly the King,I seen this video and you can easily see Elvis is the King of Entertainers. My only complaint is the split screen but it is definately a must to have. I can't wait for the release on DVD. I hope it will be out soon.
4,"enjoyable, thoroughly researched foofaraw","I enjoyed Rogo's analyses of various religious and parareligious phenomena. I wish he would stick to the facts, just the facts, thank you, and not go out on various limbs opining that which nobody asked him to opine. For example, he explains that what happened at Zeitoun in 1968 ""becomes clear"" (or was it ""becomes completely obvious""). Well, it certainly wasn't obvious to me, and, for my money, it cheapened an otherwise careful, thoughtful analysis to proffer such flubgubbery. I also found it disappointing to read such fascinating occurrences--documented, absolutely-true-you've-got-to-trust-me and all--only to discover that the ""references"" for them were to be found in the august likes of National Enquirer, Weekly World News, and such (never forget the sight gag in ""Airplane!"" where, while all the other journals tell of the airline disaster, Weekly World News's headline is ""Boy Trapped in Refrigerator Eats Own Foot"")."
2,The best Freddy sequel in the series,A couple of cheesy killings and Freddy going on a wild rampage at a party actually make this entertaining. Would have scored three stars if it wasn't for the bad ending in Freddy's boiler room.
3,The worst of the best,"The nightmare on elm street series is a classic 1980's horror series that spawned many copy-cats. This is a very good movie, on its own. This, however is one of the weakest of the series. The acting is good, especially the female lead. The special effects are not up to par with the rest of the series. Go rent this movie..but dont let your opinion of it keep you from enjoying the rest of the series. Remember the ""campy"" nature of this series."
2,Quite disapointing,"Expectant horror sequel to the box office Nightmare On Elm St starring Robert Englund and Heather LangenKamp. The storyline isn't too bad, it's what one expected really. 5 years have now passed and a new family have moved into the house of Nancy who has now moved. Little knowing of it's past...they soon find out. This film is quite tedious and is barely watchable but if you are a horror fan like I am you have to watch the film. Very boring with a terrible ending but I won't spoil that for you."
3,Has its moments.,"A teenaged boy and his family move into Nancy's house five years after the events which made the property an estate agent's nightmare to sell. Before long Freddy is lurking about, planning to use the boy Jesse's body in order to enter reality.This sequel is more akin to 'haunted house' films than the original Elm Street film. Aside from a stunning opening sequence involving a school bus hanging over a ravine, there is very little in the way of dream-like images. The mad bird scene is a genuine piece of gripping horror and there are a few fantasy-like creatures, but these are in almost complete darkness and on the screen for only a matter of seconds.The homosexual undertones are unusual in this kind of film and add interest, even if they remain underdeveloped. However, parts of the film just fail to make sense, and the tedious 'final showdown' with Freddy is a complete cop-out."
2,While impressive at times. As a whole it isn't very good.,"With boring main actors and a tedious story that never really takes itself seriously. This is my least favorite of the Nightmare films and although it does have a few scenes thtat save it from being a complete waste of time. The scene where Freddy rips off the top of his head and shows his boiling brains and let's loose one of his best quotes in the series ""You've got the body, I've got the brains"" steals the show. The plot is rather boring with very few deaths and barely any interesting ones at that. With only Freddy to save this movie from a one star, I do not recommend you buy this film. But if you've got to see all the Freddy films, then by all means rent it. It has just enough memorable scenes to warrant at least watching it once."
1,You have to be on heavy medication to like this one,How does this movie have to come in with number 1. It confused me. even the producer Bob Shaye called this movie an accident. How can Freddy just pop out of a dream with out being pulled out! If you watch the series leave this out until your finished then watch it. I gave this one a star because Freddys in it. nothing more nothing less!
4,Not the best but close,What makes this movie so good? Well I will tell you because Freedy gets to be evil and not just a funny man in a red and green sweater that kills people and makes jokes. The movie is a classic the story was well done and the effects are good enough to get buy on. Most people think this is the worst of the first five and thats because its different. Watch this movie.
1,The least effective sequel in the series,"I do not know what the people at New Line were thinking when they gave the green light for this movie to be made, but it is pointless. I think they realized that when the third installment came out because there is no mention of this one even existing. Anyway, the horrid plot, if you want to call it that, is Freddy returns to the kids on elm street, via the main character's body, played by Mark Patton. Thankfully, everything gets back on track with Elm Street 3, and believe me you do not need to see this one to watch the third one. GRADE: D-"
2,I Love Freddy But this is Not Him,This movie is a decent movie with a lot of gore but the plot is weak and the acting is horrible. Kim Myers is a good actor but she does not fit in this roll like she did in Bloodline. Freddy still is a psycotic killer but he changed into more of a jokester which really is killing the series. Also Mark patton's character whines and cries through out the movie like a little baby and it really kills the movie. This movie is just for hardcore fans or people collecting the entire series. This only gets two stars because of the violence and gore.
4,NOT AS GOOD AS THE FIRST BUT A GOOD HORROR MOVIE,"THIS IS THE 2ND SCARIEST NIGHTMARE MOVIE, BEFORE FREDDY FOUND HIS HUMOR. ANYWAY 4 STARS."
1,Nothing,"I have seen all the sequels from ""A nightmare on elm street"" and i liked all of them except this one. This movie is the worst with a very bad plot. This movie was just a nightmare!!!"
1,Nightmare on Elmstreet 2 is a terrible movie.,"Everything about this movie is bad. Bad acting, bad script, and bad directing. It is a shame that this movie didn't live up to the original Wes Craven classic. Many scenes in this film make absolutely no sense. Freddy Kruger goes from a cold-hearted killer to a jokester who has a lame ""witty"" remark for everything. The only reason why I gave it one star is that there wasn't an option for no stars."
1,There is only one good thing about this film.,"I rented this film and the only good thing about it was that I did not buy it. As for the writing, direction and acting, it was all terrible. All in all, this movie was so terrible that it became boring. Avoid this movie."
5,"A Nightmare On Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge,",This movie is awesome. robert englund returns as freddy krueger that nightmariesh villian everyone loves to love. i do have to agree with some of the other people that this was not as good as the first one but it still is pretty good for only one reason that robert englund came back to play his role as freddy. i liked the second one but the first one was better. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
2,Not a good follow up to a great movie,This was awful. Nobody can really say 5 was worse than this. Weak movie with bad acting and awful plot. Freddy Kruger wasn't the least bit scary in this and most of it was just down right stupid. It was a bad immediate sequel to this. The series would've ended if 3 hadn't been good. I'm telling you even Nightmare on Elm Street fans shouldn't see this.
1,This is the WORST FILM I HAVE EVER SEEN!,"The plot is unintelligable, the acting is bad, and the death scenes are pathetic. The entire premise is completly diffrent than the first, causing the largest movie inconsistancies the world has ever known."
3,Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge,"Disappointing... I love the Halloween & Friday the 13th films. I recently decided to finally watch the Nightmare on Elm Street series, I've only seen the Original (1st) and the 2010 Remake including the Freddy vs Jason (which was pretty good). I really liked the Original, but I had mixed feelings about the Remake. Now on to the Original's sequel review. I thought this one was going to be really good, had an okay start, that made me laugh, but I thought it was going to be really good, but I was disappointed. It wasn't scary at all, maybe because it's from the 80s but it should have some good jumps or at least a ooooh! Had probably one good scene and I'd say that one scene is the reason of seeing this movie.RENT IT."
4,"Three, four, better lock the door","Better than most people say, I really enjoyed this movie which was just as good as the origional.Freddy returns to try and posses the body of a boy named Jesse who has just moved into the house in which Nancy lived in in the first Nightmare on Elm Street.A very good slasher movie, gorey and scary, which I would recomend to all Freddy fans."
3,A Cool Idea...Poor Execution,"The idea for ANOES 2 is pretty interesting, and it would completely alter the overall structure of the franchise, but it was WAY too early for something like this. The idea of having Freddy transcend the dream world and appear in our own is something that shows up in Freddy's Dead and the finally Freddy Vs. Jason, it didn't belong in ANOES 2.Because Craven wasn't involved in this one, the storyline is quite streamlined, and the characters (while somewhat likable are quite one dimensional).Overall, ANOES 2 doesn't hit the nail on the head, but the idea behind it was ahead of its time (probably in a bad way more than a good one)."
2,out of all the Freddy Kruger movies this is the second worse,"The actings terrible, the story is very stupid, and I just gave it two stars because it will make you jump often. I really only recomend this to die hard Freddy fans."
4,"""Good movie, but a little disturbing...""","Now don't get me wrong, ""A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge"" was a good movie, but some parts were really disturbing. Like the part where Jesse's tongue gets really long, that was really weird, or when there were those two parrots in the cage and one ripped the other one to shreds and then burst into flames, that was just weird. I think most of these Freddy movies are too weird for their own good, but they are still okay movies. I think Wes Craven went a little too far with this one, but maybe they'll get better as they go, who knows. If you haven't seen this movie yet, then I suggest you rent it first, and if you like it, buy it."
4,"OKAY,ITS GOOD!","Lots of my friend told me to stay away from this movie.They said it was the worst Horror movie.YEAH RIGHT!Okay the movie can have its stupid parts but this is okay!After Nancy moves out of her old house,there is a new kid on Elm.Street and Freddy must pay a visit.Freddy starts haunting the teenager and gets inside his body.Now the boy's friends must survive the night from the man himself FREDDY!The best scene is the Pool party.""YOU ARE ALL MY CHILDREN NOW!"" and""HELP YOURSELF F--KER""are my favorite lines."
1,Tries to be thrilling but fails,"Part 2 of the Nighmare On Elmstreet series was not entertaining. The movie starts out fine with Freddy trying to scare the young man Jesse in his dreams, but the movie gets out of line. Freddy then starts to possess Jesse's body out of nowhere, and later Freddy comes into the world and even dissapers again, and the movie get's real confusing. It tries to scare the audience but too many things did not make sense in the movie as it sarts too get boring very rapidly. It had some gruesome scenes that seemed more gross that spine-chilling, at least to me. Luckily Wes Craven got involved in Part 3 which should have been part 2. This movie does not even relate to the rest of the other Nighymare movies. Avoid at all costs, the movies a joke."
2,The worst of the series,This movie doesn't really even take place in the dream world; it's all about freddy using this guy's body in the REAL world to kill. Not that scary.
1,A Disgusting film that is a mess.,"NOES 2 is a big mess. The acting is horrible, it's a disgusting flick that is isolated away from the rest of the series. Nothing in this movie is explained, specifically of how Freddy can posses a body all of a sudden. It tries to be scary but the movie has to many polt holes which does not make the viewer all that scared. What a joke is movie is."
3,It's really not that bad....,"Ah yes, part two. Not many people like this one because of the simple fact that it doesn't hold the original plot very well. Granted, part two's story line does stray, but there is something about it that is still good: Freddy is still dark, creepy, and pretty darn scary. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy the others in the series. But I do like a horror movie to at least be slightly scary. If the vilan is crackin' jokes left and right, it's not very scary. So kudos to the dark and scary Freddy!!"
2,Not A Very Good Sequel!,"This isn't the best sequel, that's for sure. But Part 2 is better than Part 5. This is going to be a short review because I don't know how to describe. All I can suggest is, stick with the first one, instead."
3,Not a good sequel,"This film is dissapointing coming of a spectacular 1st film. Freddy is still a dark character, just doesn't have what other sequels have, but still is very watchable"
2,This movie's okay,"Boy and his family move into the house that the girl from part 1 lived in and starts having nightmares about Freddy taking over his body. And the dreams become reality. Okay movie is slow, boring, and pretty lame most of the way, but the special effects give it some leverage. Pizza and pepsi."
3,"Good, scary, disgusting... Not as good as the first one!","Well, I saw this from TV and it was okay. But only okay! I mean, it was scary of course, but not good. Don't waste your money to buy it, but you can always borrow it from your friend. I gave it 3 stars, and that tells you that is isn't worth for money. ""A Nightmare on Elm Street""... If you haven't watched it, you have to see it! It's a classic, this is okay."
2,Very painful to watch,"I find this part of the series to be the worst. It is very painful to watch. This is one of the reasons I wouldn't recommend getting the Nightmare On Elm Street Collection. The plot is to laugh and loop holes just seem to be abundant. After watching this once it is almost impossible to watch it a second time (unless you've had a few beers, maybe). It is a film about a kid who becomes possessed by Freddy and cannot control himself from killing those he dislikes. Really awful gym teacher character who we'd rather not see in leather or naked at all. I would recommend the 1st, 3rd, New Nightmare, and even Freddy Vs. Jason over the rest of the bunch, but this one I would have to say is the worst. We could all live without."
3,Nightmare 2 doesn't scare like the original,Freddy's Revenge falls under the box-office cracks with its worthless script. Freddy comes back to higher his body count but fails in creating a good story to follow by. Just record it on T.V. don't bother throwing away 10 bucks to buy it.
2,Nightmare 2 Review,"Poor sequel to Wes Craven's brilliant original film. In this awful follow-up, they decide that rather than following the format laid down in the original, they want to go and make Freddy into what they believe he should be. Rather than a film about a maniac terrorizing teens in their dreams, this is pretty much a really bad haunted house picture.This one has a new kid (Mark Patton) moving into the house from the original. For some reason, Freddy is invading his body and subsquentaly driving him into insanity. There are a few cool sequences with a school bus and a pool party but the story really kills this one before it even gets started. A thinly-disguised bisexual subplot is thrown in for reasons unknown and never really fully explained."
2,"Not my favorite, but it has the BEST horror death!","In general, this is by far, not my favorite horror film (actually, I don't watch horror films anymore). However, the very best scene in any horror film is in this one: the murder of Coach Schneider in the shower! It was both hysterical and gruesome at the same time; I LOVE that scene! I'm surprised that not many other horror fans comment on that scene. It is SO COOL! I also thought that a character like Schneider was very creative for a horror film."
2,PICKS UP WHERE NIGHTMARE LEFT OFF,"FOR A SEQUEL IT'S OKAY. FREDDY IS BACK, SLASHING IN YOUR DREAMS, SPECIAL EFFECTS ARE WELL-DONE. FREDDY'S HUMOR IS STILL INTACT. STILL SCARY BUT AFTER A WHILE YOU WONDERED WHY THEY BOTHERED."
2,THIS NIGHTMARE ISN'T SCARY.,"** 1/2 stars for this flick. ""A Nightmare On Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge"" shares some similarities with the original movie, but gone are the beautiful and charismatic heroine Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp), the touch of the director Wes Craven, and the imaginative and hallucinatory sequences from the first part.Even though, sometimes is an entertaining sequel that several times falls in the mediocrity and conformity of the sequels, Freddy Krueger's diehard fans certainly should be the persons that will enjoy better this flick.""A Nightmare On Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge"" is a movie with mixed results, sometimes is good and sometimes is plain ridiculous. The third part proved to be much better than this movie, but still would be far from the original Nightmare. Only for Freddy's fans."
4,The Sequel everyone waited for!,"This sequel had high expectations when it first came out,and although it didnt live up to all of them it was still a very entertaining movie. This movie bombed at the box office, but I think a lot of people didnt give it a chance because Wes Craven didnt have anything to do with it. The movie was really very entertaining and had all the things that makes a horror movie a horror movie. Violence, no sex this time around but it did have a little foreplay. The plot was pretty good, A new family moves to elm street because they got the house so cheap (I wonder why! ) The familys teenage son begins having nightmares about krueger trying to get him to kill for him. Rated R for violence but isnt as bad as the first one, and a little bit of language. Overall this movie lives up as a sequel but isnt as good as the first one."
3,Not as bad as people say,"After seeing the first NOES, I was eager to see the sequel. After reading all the reviews here on Amazon.com, I was a little hasty to watch it cause there's nothing worse than a bad horror movie! But this movie is seriously good, not classic. The plot is pretty good not just a rehash of the original. Killing scenes are good and different, a bit. Freddy says some cracks and dialogue. I even laughed more than once. Effects are good for its time, even today. Dark and gloomy atmosphere surrounds the movie, which is good. Although a little slow moving in the beginning, it picks up soon enough, gotta let the plot develop. The best scene is at the ""party"". The only real disappiontment was the ending. Although the ending is weak, if you understood the plot it's possible for part three, because he never actually took form in the real world-his actions were Jesse's. Not a classic (never really tried to be one, it's not the worst Freddy. I could rewatch it many times as well."
2,what a farce,"Well it started out good, but as the movie drug on it became weaker and weaker and weaker till it finally lost all elements of horror. This is the sequel that ran the true horror aspect of freddy into the ground. The plot was just as horrible a freddy was.I could have made a better sequel than this."
2,not that good,"this movie isn't that good, its strays from the original almost completely. This movie is a bad movie."
2,A major step down from the original,"After Wes Craven crafted a classic with the original Nightmare on Elm Street, this second installment debuted a year later with Jack Sholder (The Hidden) at the helm. Much of the suspense and eerie atmosphere from the original film is replaced here with some great gore effects and set pieces, but as a whole is a very poor comparison to the original with an uncompelling and contradictory storyline (the presence of Wes Craven is sorely missed) and characters that we could really care less about. Craven would return as co-writer in the next installment, Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors, which was a big step above this lackluster entry in the series."
2,"THE SEQUEL HAS IT'S MOMENTS, BUT NOWHERE NEAR AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL!","I am reviewing the entire Nightmare on Elm Street series, but not this DVD release. I own the box set and I wanted to do individual reviews for each film.The original film is viewed by many as a ""classic""! Even though I do not share this opinion, I do like the original film a lot more than this confusing and uneven sequel. It's still a fun film to watch around Halloween and it does have it's moments. The DVD transfer is good, but it does seem a bit dark. I give the film 2 1/2 stars, but knock off a 1/2 stars for a sub par DVD release."
3,Average,"Nightmare on elm street 2 is you average joe blow horror sequel in which the only thing that has anything to do with the orginal is the anti-hero Freddy kruger and the house in the orginal movie. however, the concept is well thought out. It just never was able to take off"
4,FREDDYS REVENGE!,"It isnt as good as the original but damn near it. It has all the suspense of the first one and still has that creepy atmosphere but it starts you off with a whole new story and family leaving you wondering what ever happened to nancy. I just think they should have continued the story with Nancy and if they didnt want to they could have at least gave a little more detail concerning where she had gone or what happened to her. That is the only thing that keeps this movie from getting five stars. The plot is pretty good. Freddy is trying to possess the body of the teenage boy who lives in the Krueger house. All of the horror elements are there. Atmosphere,Suspense and a whole lotta gore. It may not be as good as the original but still deserves to be praised for being one of the greater Horror movies of the 80s"
2,"Review of ""Nightmare"" sequel","Poor sequel to Wes Craven's brilliant original film. In this awful follow-up, they decide that rather than following the format laid down in the original, they want to go and make Freddy into what they believe he should be. Rather than a film about a maniac terrorizing teens in their dreams, this is pretty much a really bad haunted house picture.This one has a new kid (Mark Patton) moving into the house from the original. For some reason, Freddy is invading his body and subsquentaly driving him into insanity. There are a few cool sequences with a school bus and a pool party but the story really kills this one before it even gets started. A thinly-disguised bisexual subplot is thrown in for reasons unknown and never really fully explained."
2,A dissapointment.,"This movie should have been a lot better. Freddy is already turning into the unscary pop icon in this movie and a decent idea for a plot is messed up by careless mistakes and blatant stupidity. This doesn't scare but instead tries to be a comedy. It ignores everything that made the original work. And just think, horror sequels get worse with every sequel."
3,Freddy rules along with Michael Myers and Jason!!,"This one's scary as hell. Especially at the pool party scene. But heck, its not TOO scary as the first. A ""new"" kid moves to Elm ST., living in the exact house as Nancy did from the original: NOES. It's very realistic looking and you almost start to have sympathy for Freddy's victims. Some people think that this one isn't that great, but I think it's okay. It may not be the best, but it does have the dark touch as the original. My fav's in the series are ""Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors"", ""A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: the Dream Master"", ""A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: Dream Child"", and ""The Final Nightmare"" (or is it??). I like alot of this horror stuff. Michael Myers and Jason are also good horror monsters. Be sure to check out ""Halloween"" 1,2,5, and H20 along with ""Friday the 13th"" 1,2,4,6, and 8. THESE GUYS ARE THE BEST OF HORROR WITHOUT DOUBT!!"
2,"OK... but, not great...","Continues where the original left off. A teenage boy and his family moves in to the house that Nancy, from ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"", once occupied. Like Nancy, the teenager has nightmares, and soon learns that a boogeyman by the name of Fred Krueger is trying to possess his body.The plot is not so good, and so is the ending. In fact, fans of Freddy Krueger find this movie awful. I tend to agree. If you haven't seen any of the ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" movies, you can watch the original, forego this movie, and go directly to Part 3: Dream Warriors, because the third installment doesn't start where the second one left off."
1,Made No Sense # 2,Like the 1st one I didnt think this one made a whole lot of sense either. I actually think this one made less sense than the 1st one. Like I said in my reviw for the 1st movie if your not familiar with these movies please rent first.
1,What a crummy mistake of the original!!!,"I bought this movie along with the whole series thinking that it wouldn't be great to watch, and boy was I ever wrong. It had to be THE worst stand up comic, I have ever had the misfortune to see. Freddy was different, the story took the original downpath, the actors and special effects were weak along with the plot. Wes Craven was right to decide not to have anyything to do with this film. He never even was on any of the credits until the very end of the cast at the end. The movie is a total waste of money, and Robert Shaye did the worst to his good friend Mr. Craven, by producing the thing. Save your money for something better, than this believe me."
2,A nightmare on elm street 2,Boring hate it like the first and third better. The movie should be a PG-13 the say the F- word about 4 times and the have a Male Naked in the back.It just about a kid who moves into nancys old house. LAME
1,Worst In Series Just Ahead Of Part 5,"This is up there as the worst sequels in history,even coming close to movies like Predator 2,Scream 2,Speed 2 this is just as bad. First off it really has nothing to do with series and even worse defeats the purpose of using dreams since Freddy uses some gay boys body. Also No Heather Langenkamp and only two deaths that aren't even cool or creative. This movie is like Halloween 3,and FT13th A New Beginning it doesn't belong in the series. YOU WILL NEW THIS MOVIE IS A JOKE WHEN YOU SEE THIS GAY KID JUMPING ON HIS BED IN UNDERWEAR SINGING TOUCH ME,TEASE ME,HOLD ME SQUEEZE, STICK TO THE ORIGINAL(A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET,A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 3(THE REAL SEQUEL W/ HEATHER LAGENKAMP AND JOHN SAXON FROM THE FIRST)"
1,Proof That Sequels Aren't As Good As The Originals.,"The first movie in this series was scary and original.This sequel to that movie is so horrible,that no word in the human language can describe it.In this movie,Freddy takes control of some gay boy's body.Very stupid.This is one of the worst sequels I have ever seen in my entire life.The scene where the gay boy meets the gym teacher in the crossdressing bar and the gym teacher has him run laps is very stupid.Lots of stupidness.Stupid Stupid Stupid!!!Avoid this movie at all.Oh by the way,since he doesn't stalk your dreams in this movie,feel free to go to sleep."
4,You've got the body.... i've got the brain!,"Like most sequels, Nightmare 2 is descent but rather lacking of the original. It pertains Freddy's ability to scare the hell out of us, the outlandish special effects and gory death sequences, Robert Englund, and some rather interesting plot turns. Yep, in fact that's why this movie doesn't get the fives star. In the first movie Freddy seemed rather ticked off at being lured into the real world. See,in the dream world he's unstoppable, but in reality he's only human. In this movie he now wants to use Jesse to enter the real world.... what the heck? Overall it is a pretty good sequel considering the stuff from other franchises. Oh well Freddy fans, don't be reluctant to its awesome 80s slasher chessiness, pick it up!"
4,Tends to Get Slow,"This movie was alright. It wasn't the best in the series, and it tends to get slow at times. I'm not saying this movie wasn't enjoyable, but the first one was more entertaining. I'd say that it's a satisfying sequel."
2,Freddy's Revenge,"Revenge over whom one might ask? The viewers most certainly feel the brunt of his anger in this movie that seem to have been produced only to cash in on the success of the first movie.The story is about teenager Jesse Walsh (Patton) that move in to Nancy Thompsons (the heroine of the first movie) house.This time Freddy's aproach to killing off kids is different, as he apparantly uses Jesses body to commit the crimes, and it is up to his girlfriend to put a stop to Krueger(Englund).The movie seems to lack alot of the charm and the humor that the original had. The only reason to be thankful for this movie, is that we got A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors, which in my opinion is the best of the movies"
3,The Original Is always The Best Nevermind Remakes.,"Part 2 isn't as good due to the fact of this fruitcake in the movie and because freddy isn't in it as much and it starts anew from the last movie.To me part 1-5,(with 1 of course being the very best),2 being good,and 5 downright silly.represents the height of the freddy franchise. Wes Craven's New Nightmare was also good, If your like me who grew up on this franchise watching On WBFS-33, or wdzl-39(the most) then NO REMAKE w/o Englund will due."
4,good slasher,its got guys in tighty whities and boxers and some homo erotic scenes. the only 2 down falls are that it doesnt really go with the other freddy movies(its kinda miscellaneous movie) and the deaths arent elaborate compared to the other movies.
2,Not scary,"I just didn't find this second installment to Nightmare On Elm Street scary at all. And neither did my Dad. It's definitely, so far, the worst Freddy film. The only bit that really freaked me out was the demonic parakeet, and that's mainly because I have a bird myself. I didn't like the lead guy either - he was a bit wimpy wasn't he? It also has the highest body count of all the Nightmare films, but none of them were that different to any other slasher movie.I hope the rest are better, cos I did buy the seven disc box set. Hmmmm. It also doesn't use Charles Bernstein's original theme, or a variation of it, which is disappointing, as I do like that theme.I'm gonna try and forget this film, and keep watching the rest, I just hope this was just a mishap.Oh, and look out for the REAL Robert Englund in a very, very brief role as the bus driver in the opening sequence. It's very quick, and you'll be thinking ""did I see him or didn't I?"" Yes, it is him."
3,"Three, four, better lock your door!!!!!","Here it is, five years since Nancy Thompson sent Fred Krueger back to the depths of hell, but he's back again. Jesse Walsh and his family just moved into Nancy's old house. And Jesse is suffering from the same nightmares as Nancy. Then Jesse and his girlfriend Lisa Webber discover a diary of Nancy's as he's cleaning up his room that tells all about her dreams. Now Jesse knows he's not crazy. But nothing will stop Freddy from trying to take possesion over Jesse.This is a decent sequel, but sort of a disappoinment compared to the original."
3,it gets a 3 star because im a freddy fan..........,"in this one,ol freddy posesses some teenager and kills through his body.only freddy will be recognized.its the second part of 8.this is the 7th best id say but still pretty good.any true horror fan or freddy nut will like it.the main characters girlfriend is hot!theres an intense part where the girl is trying to get the posessed mc to fight freddys power over him.this is after a very messy pool party.the special effects are ok.the later ones are better.in 3 he kills at an asylum.in 4 its their survivors.5 goes into his past.6-way into his past,7-he comes out of the tv and in 8 he fights jason.they didnt really have a complete enough resolution in thier epic battle.maybe a part 2 to the fight before getting back to the onslaught?freddy was winning by my account.................."
3,err...,"this really isnt what i expected...its wierd and not really having a lot to do with Freddy...yea hes in it, but not a lot and its mostly the boy who kills...and this is a slow moving, few scares, ugly chicks, bad acting bore fest...kind of a bad sequal...and theres too much male nudity...this sequal can be skipped and not missed...what a bad way to have done Freddy"
2,Your WORST Nightmare!,"Nightmare 2 was definatly the worst of the series. It was more gory and obnoxious than scary. The movie was released in 1985, a year after the original was released, but it's supposed to take place 5 years later? There were some good scenes though. Like the school bus scene and the pool party scene. The rest of it was gory, confusing, and stupid."
2,ACCEPTABLE,"part 2 in the series isnt ""ridiculous"", its just lacking. The killing count is too low in this movie. The plot wasnt all that bad but Freddy could have caused more blood shed than he did. I like when he raided the pool party but it did over step the boundaries, because Freddy is supposed to be mysterious and hardly anyone knowing about him. i think it could have been a hell of alot better. Bottom line Part 2 did ""just enough"" to spark another sequel, had it been any less than what it is, Part 3 may have not gotten any attention."
2,Please Tell Me Why this Was Necessary,"Once ""The Very Best of 10cc"" was released in 1997, it was the collection to have. That collection included 15 tracks that spanned 10cc's career, ending with the Godley and Creme hit ""Cry."" So why would this CD be released, especially since the only thing it offers over the prior CD is ""Channel Swimmer"" and ""Don't Hang Up?"" Buy the CD ""How Dare You"" and ""The Very Best of 10cc"" and you will have three times the music you have on this CD for only twice the price. An unnecessary addition to the 10cc portfolio."
5,My five year old won't stop singing the songs.,"Well, I ordered this item very late at night, and I somehow ended up ordering two instead of one... by complete mistake. It turned out okay, because for Christmas I gave one to my daughter (5) and one to my nephew (7). Watching it with them makes me feel like a kid again. Okay, the movie is a little dark, a little creepy... but harmless enough for all ages. I remember being fixated by the musical numbers, and by that deep-voiced, man-eating plant when I was little. It's good to pass this movie on to a new generation. :)"
4,Like the movie...not the singing,"This is a pretty good movie, except for all the singing....I know it's that type of movie, but I don't care for it. But I love the plot!"
5,this movie is hilarous,"this movie will make you laugh hard.With 2 funny songs, ""feed me"",and ""dentis"".Oh, and the music is great too.My 2 favorite songs are ""suddenly seymour"" and ""downtown"". The first time i saw this movie was when my theater teacher brought it in and showed it to us.BUY IT, DARN IT, BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,"Son, be a dentist","Very entertaining. Great songs and performances. Steve Martin steals the show, and his scene with Bill Murray is particularly good. I really enjoyed it, but the ending was a bit of a let-down."
5,A review for the BEST film ever,"Little shop of Horrors was the best film I ever saw. I never tire of it! I think the actors play the charactures very well. I love the music in little shop of horrors, I find the music more pleasant to listen to than pop music. The film is weird and wonderful-just like me!"
1,BUYER BEWARE THIS COMPANY WILL SHIP YOU A REGION 2 DVD MOVIE,Movie mars what a joke! I Placed many of orders with this company the company sent me a region2 dvd moviethat do not play on american dvd players i contacted customer service talked to the manager bythe name of Beth who informed me that the companies return policy suck!! I WILL NEVER ORDER FROM THIS PLACE AGAIN!!! VERY DISAPPOINTED.
4,You Don't Have to Be a Cult Fan . . .,"This was a gift for a family member, and it went over really well. This has always been a terrific movie, and the addition of the legendary original ending is just the topper."
3,Great movie,This is a movie that will stand the test of time. The movie is entertaining and the music is good (by the Four Tops) but beware of the ending too much cursing.
5,Great Movie for fun,I love this movie. My mom and I watched it together when I was younger and I have loved it ever since.
3,Where Is The Alternate Ending,"I bought this at Target and was very happy to do so! When I watched it with commentery, i was waiting for the alternate ending to play after the credits or somthing and it didn't, so I went to the outtakes on the specials. All that was, was a gag real. I have the soundtrack to the revival and was wanting to see the alternate ending! First they film it, preview it, cut it, and put the happy ending in. Now what's the deal with that? But besides that it is a funny musical comedy! I love it!"
5,Love the musical,"This is a funny musical. One of my favorite musicals and Steve Martin is great. It is about a plant from space, that is purchased by a quite guy that works at a flower shop. The plant starts to make him famous but seems to be dying. He finds out it needs blood to live and grow. The story is good and has a subplot of a love story between him and a coworker he has always had a crush on."
2,"little shop of horrors is horror master, not a good thing.","This movie is not to be viewed by little kids, because I have for two years after viewing it had a very hard time sleeping. If you would like your kids not wanting to eat greens, because of this movie sure go ahead."
1,Little Shop of Horrors VHS,"I never cared much for little shop of horrors, I just dont like it,it's bizarre and silly and pointless.and Jack nicholson is in it?"
5,For those in the know,I had this on VHS. This is one movie that had I had to purchase in an upgraded format. This will be a permanent fixture in my collection.
2,Yes and No on the Director's Cut,"I absolutely HATED the ending of the this new Director's cut. Everybody and I mean everybody dies, except for the plant. What I did like was the deleted scenes of utter mayhem with Oscar worthy special effects / miniatures. To see these deleted scenes you have to get this version. And it doesn't have the option of 'alternate endings'. So to get the 'HAPPY ENDING' that we've all grown accustomed to since the film's release 30 years ago, you must stick with the original dvd. To see the extras, get this version."
5,This has to be in your collection,"I have been a fan of this movie since I was a little girl. I was one of the Do Whop girls in my high school play. This movie is fun and hip, from Audrey to silly Seymour, to the sassy do wop girls, to the crazy dentist that rides a motorcyle. Steve Martin is a creative genius anyway. I love him as an actor. The songs are contagious, you can't help but sing along. I showed this movie to my kids and they loved it. You have to own this movie."
5,Thank you Warner Home Video.,"Well, 26 years after it was made, I've FINALLY seen one of my all-time favorite movies for the first time. Little Shop of Horrors. The REAL version, not the sappy happy ending version. Earlier this month Warner Home Entertainment released it on DVD and Blu-ray with the original, darker ending restored. It is amazing. I never realized just how cheesy the theatrical ending was until I saw this version. And yeah, I'd seen the low-quality black and white version of the ending from the recalled DVD, but seeing it not only in color, not only in high-def, but actually cut back into the movie is just amazing. And since I've seen the theatrical version so many times growing up (so much that I wore my old VHS out entirely) that I could spot when the only change was a different camera angle. This was the greatest thing I've seen in AGES."
4,"Not like the play, but stands on its own","If you are familiar with this play, then you will be in for a surprise with the film. There are some basic and some huge differences between the two, but the number of stars that appear in the film from time to time will keep you entertained and will keep your attention. It can be scary for younger kids, so watch the rating on this one."
5,LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS WAS AN ABSOLUTE THRILL,"I'VE SEEN THIS MOVIE A THOUSAND TIMES.IT IS FUNNY ,THE MUSIC IS GREAT, THE ACTING WAS FUNNY. STEVE MARTIN WAS THE FUNNIEST PLAYIN THE DENTIST. AUDREYII'S VOICE WAS REALLY SOMETHING. THE THREE GALS WERE REALLY GOOD WITH THEIR SINGIN. BE SURE TO LET THIS VIDEO ONE OF YOUR VIDEO COLLECTIONS"
1,Broken DvD.,No 'Keep Case Packaging'. I'm in the military and I have just opened the package to find that the DvD is broken from the center of the disk to about half way to the outer side of the disk. Now I have to find one at WalMart to go with this up coming weekend 80's cult classic movies. Didn't even want to give one star.
1,Little shop of horrors,"I was really exited, about this purchase because my daughter loves this movie. The movie never worked. I kept getting an error about the format. Luckily the movie was on netflix because my daughter was so upset when it didn't work"
2,DVD not in case,"This item was ordered as a christmas gift, and when recipient opened the case, the DVD was not in there. I either need a refund or preferrably the actual DVD. Thanks"
1,Not as good as I remembered.,"I thought this was a cool movie when I was a kid. I was excited to find it in my adult hood. However once I put it in the DVD player I was greatly disappointed. Horrible acting, predictable story line. :("
2,overblown and bloated,One of the most overproduced films ever!!! The charm of the original production is lost.The original two day wonder of Roger Corman is miles ahead. Spend your money on the play.
3,Little Shop of Horrors,"Purchased this item directly from Amazon. The movie plays good when you play from beginning to end. However, if you try to select certain scenes from the main menu no volume plays on the scene. It's kind of messed up if you have to stop the movie at a certain part then come back later to watch it, you can't just go to the part you stopped watching from you have to go all the way back to the beginning. Wasn't worth the hastle of sending back and getting a refund so I just kept it."
1,be careful of who you buy from,"bought this movie from movie mars,when i recived it it would not play because it was a region 2 dvd they can only be played in unitedkingdom and germany dvd players. if i would have been aware of that i would not have bought it.tried to return had to pay to send back and then they kept half the money that was paid and didnt reimberse me for the shipping who buys dvds that cant be played on a standard dvd player.and movie mars and i are in the same state. felt like i was ripped off but its ok because it will never happend again at least by movie mars. message to the people beware when buying some people ar out to scame"
4,Mean and Green,"Didn't think they could update and yet improve the remake but I was wrong. The music arrangement was exceptional and cast selection keen. Not all have chart making vocals butyou forget about it my the first chorus. LOVE THE PLANT! If you think ""Four Tops"" when you hear it than --- your a plant lover."
4,A good film,Those who love musicals will like this film. They will enjoy the story and the way it's sung.
4,Little Shop of Horrors II,"As far as musicals go this one is pretty good despite the remake. Great cast and the script is from the original play. Well worth the $$ if you like a good musical!As far as musicals go this one is pretty good. Great cast and the script is from the original play. Well worth the $$ if you like a good musical!Gee, what happened to creativity in La La Land? Everything seems to be a remake!"
4,Great movie!,This is a terrific movie and a good interpretation of the Broadway show. Ellen Greene reprises her stage role and is just terrific. Rick Moranis is suitably nerdy as Seymour. A really fun movie at a great price.
4,'Little Shop' Is Fun!,"'Little Shop Of Horrors' is one of my favorite films. It puts music and wonderful effects together perfectly like no other movie I've seen before. Ellen Green is so wonderfully perfect, it's no wonder she went stright from the stage production to the screen. And who else (besides me of course) could play Syemour better than Rick Moranis. Such a treat. Still has a tone of darkness about it. Probably because of the sets being so colorless. Still, full of humor and great directing by Frank Oz."
5,The alternate ending makes it worth it!,"Most people have no idea that the actual ending of the musical isn't a happy affair! The Director's Cut of ""Little Shop of Horrors"" is a great way to see what was originally planned and executed before the test audiences saw it. Most British musicals end on a ""down note"" with death and suffering. Americans just don't understand that since everyone is raised on ""happily ever after."" Now die-hard musical fans can enjoy both endings on this crisp, clear Blu-ray version of one of the most underrated musicals to be transferred to motion pictures!The booklet attached in the cover gives really interesting information for those not as familiar with the ""Little Shop"" backstory. The special features on the Blu-ray are also a delight to watch -- but I won't spoil any fun moments here! You can't go wrong adding this fun show to your collection!"
1,Director's Cut - Blah,"Frank Oz, in the extras on this DVD, explains that the Director's Cut with it's radically different ending depicts the original version of the film, true to the original screenplay and duplicating the endings of the first film and the play. I'm happy that there is an explanation for this and I respect that the film-makers are trying to honor the original vision. That being said, I absolutely hated it. Having watched it, I no longer know what the film is supposed to be about. Where in the first version we saw a very sweet 'against-the-odds' love story and good triumphing over evil, this version blows that out of the water. If there is now a moral to this story, I'd love to know what it is. I'm selling my copy on eBay and going back to the 1986 version. Takers?"
4,Classic Horror Musical,"This fun, upbeat musical of a dark comedy was mostly the way I remembered it, except for the profanity. If I could edit out those parts it would be perfect!"
3,Beware of Plants,Best plant movie since Invation of the Body Snatchers. Good PG entertainment with Steve Martin adding his own brand of comedy. Enjoyable family entertainment and music.
5,Classic musical movie,"It feels odd calling a movie that I saw in high school a ""classic"" but if the shoe fits....Good quality, no issues"
1,grossly disappointing,"Wish I'd read the description of this book before ordering. I figured it was just a newer printing of the original, however it is a *scanned copy*, and so poorly done it is laughable, or would be if they hadn't charged me $26 for it. The scanner is Nabu Press and they say this is in the public domain, however I am not sure that is true. The front page clearly states that it is a scanned copy and they appreciate the buyer understanding that the quality may suffer...which it does. The price is outrageous for such a ripoff. More details on Nabu Press here: [...]Buyer beware!"
1,Won't play!,"I love Andy Griffith, his music, stories and in his many TV/Movie roles. Have never purchased his music but have heard his Gospel songs and find them very soothing! I have had this several months but only this Saturday did I have teh opportunity to play it. I put the tape in and it was slow and couldn't hear it. I did all the things you do when cassettes won't play, but to no avail, will have to send it back if I want to go to the trouble!"
5,Ziegler - excellent writer excellent Professor,"Dr Ziegler is the best Professor at Western Washington University bar none. He made Political Science come alive in his class.. His book was also required reading and I can't think of one student who did not read it from cover to cover. After I graduated from Western, I gave the book to my dad to read because of Zieglers great insight. I took two classes from Dr Ziegler even though my major only required one."
5,TV pullout,"I got this pull-out to mount a flat-panel tv in a space formally used for an ""old""-style CRT TV. It works great holding the tv outside the opening."
3,TV does not attach to the plate,"This is a very sturdy and well-working product. Be aware that, at least with our TV, you cannot attach the TV to the plate. Thus the TV sits on top which makes sliding back and forth a bit precarious! We put dowels in the metal plate's holes, which fit into the TV's base thus at least avoiding a lot of sliding around. We also used heavy duty velcro strips with two-sided adhesive to steady. This seemed to work ok.Overall, the product will meet the needs, but there should have been a better way to secure the TV. (There are no instructions sent with the product, nor the hardware either)."
2,Do not buy this Camera!!,"We received this camera as a Christmas present last year, and we loved it at first. Loads of features and easy to use. However, the camera died after 6 hours of use. We took the camera into an authorized repair shop, and it has been there for the past 4 months!!! The RCA Customer service department is HORRIBLE!!...So now we have a camera sitting in a repair shop, and a manufacturer that won't return our calls or stand behind their product."
3,I Really Wanted to Like this One,"I was never really fond of this film, even though it was Peter Sellers' last actual portrayal of Inspector Clouseau. It started out excellent but slowly deteriorated into mundane and silly slapstick. By the time it reached Hong Kong I thought it was terrible. Even Henry Mancini's score seems a little tired in this one. It all seems like very forced filmmaking. I suppose some of the same things could be said about CURSE OF THE PINK PANTHER but in that film the script follows a logical progression from the classic Clouseau skits to slapstick and finally into the absurd. It seemed to work wildly in that film. I actually found the scenes in TRAIL OF THE PINK PANTHER with Peter Sellers much funnier than in THE REVENGE OF THE PINK PANTHER. THE REVENGE OF THE PINK PANTHER remains a weak entry in the series for me."
5,Best Dolly film ever!,"Yes, It's true. I am a diehard Dolly Parton fan, but if I wasn't I would still love this movie. Dolly's natural charm and humor comes to play in this rags-to-riches type of story. This is a must see!! Dolly is hilarious. This movie is a five star plus. You definitely won't regret seeing this. I don't care what the critics say. By far my favorite movie ever!"
4,Good.... But No Extras!,"I loved this movie! Shirlee Kenyon was a down on her luck country girl, when a mistake turns her into a big time radio doctor. I thought that her boss was kind of an a hole... He goes by the impression that people who have been married 3 times are losers, or those that have something real to say, He would write them off as losers..This film shows off Dolly's spicy side of things! She had quite a few one lines... ""I am like a one legged man in a butt kickin' contest!' Plus you get to see an early appearance of Terri Hatcher! (Lois & Clark The New Adventures of Superman)I would like to have seen the trailer. as well as the music videos and even a commentary would have been nice... Aside from that, I still love the film...."
4,Enjoyable comedy,"Dolly Parton is utterly delightful in this corny, syrupy but immensebly enjoyable comedy. Her unlikely romance with James Woods is actually quite interesting as it is easy to see how Dolly's charm could permiate even the most jaded people. Sure it's not very original and it is very lightweight but it's got an old fashioned Frank Capra kind of sweetness to it."
3,Feel Good Movie,"Not a complex story line, but its not too cookie cutter either. The features of the DVD aren't ellaborate, just play and scene selections. I recomend it for a few hours of entertainment with the wife or long time girlfriend."
4,From the author of Tales of Ancient Xenar,"I don't consider myself much of a movie watcher, so its rare for me to review a movie. But this film has earned a rare honor of having a review done by me. I have to say that hands-down this is one of Dolly Parton's best performances (better than 9 to 5 and far better than the Best Little Whorehouse in Texas.) In the film, she gives Chicago radio listeners good old southern down-to-earth advice. I wish the city I live in has a radio columnist like her. But I'm sure a lot of you who have seen this film and enjoyed it agree with me. We all should have an advisor like Dr. Shirlee (oops, I mean Shirlee.)"
1,Movie Mars sent out defective DVD,"Finally got the DVD in the mail, go to put it in, error message. Go to another DVD player nothing..i was so excited to watch this old movie..Movie Mars set out a defective DVD. All the movies sent out directly from Amazon, worked perfectly. Very disappointed in this company..I should of known better. Sending it back. I will purchase it elsewhere."
5,Finally,I love this movie and was thrilled when it came to Bluray. Hadn't remembered it since I first seen it but have always loved Dolly in the roles she plays. She's pretty good at singing too.Received this sooner than I thought I would. But it is a standard with Amazon.com anymore. Thank you
5,She's a Dolly who can act and give Straighttalk!,I've always loved watching Dolly Parton in the few films she has been in ever since 9 to 5 followed up by Best Little Whorehouse in Texas and my personal favorite Steel Magnolias. As we live near Branson MO and her Dixie Stampede which is dinner and a show (very entertaining with great food)we visit it often and hope she will show up!
2,"Likeable, light romantic comedy, not stars' best work","The somewhat schmaltzy formula used to concoct this film makes for a very light story that is funny in a family-cute way. The predictability for me is well summed by the self-indulgent irony the creative staff displays in things like naming the reporter ""Jack Russell"" like the terrier. I enjoy the film and came to Amazon looking to order a copy because it is a nice all-family entertainment piece, though in story and characterizations are unsatisfying, as they flatten James Woods' natural charisma and fail to elicit the endearingly sincere and uncontrived quality Dolly Parton demonstrates in Steel Magnolias. She can act, but this role might have been better served by an actress who was, and was openly perceived as, stretching into the role of Shirley -- while Jack Russell, given Woods' casting, would have benefitted from a little more spotlight and a much longer leash."
5,if you can get past james woods' lips....,"this movie makes me happy. james woods' lips, however, do not. i read somewhere that dolly parton said that james woods was the best kisser. maybe she was drunk or has a thing for jellyfish. anyhow, this movie is funny and sweet kind of like the kool-aid man."
2,Yeah right...,"Dolly is saved by stranger Jimmy while ""attempting"" to jump off a bridge. Can you guess what happens at the end? Parton is watchable in this fomula fish-out-of-water story about her getting a job (by mistake) as a radio-shrink and there are some good jokes scattered around, but the story is a bust."
1,No OAR = No Sale...,"A fun movie for sure; but where's the theatrical widescreen edition? Sorry, but I only purchase DVDs displaying the film's ORIGINAL ASPECT RATIO."
3,A romantic comedy formula movie that is still fun to watch.,"A Hollywood formula movie that is still fun to watch. A romantic comedy where guy meets gal who are at odds with one another until the flame predictably ignites, some mishaps occur and all ends happily. Not a bad formula when you see Cary Grant and wise-cracking Ann Sheridan. The guy in this case is James Woods who is a good actor but lacks Grant's charm. Dolly Parton, who plays the wise-cracking female lead,has the charm but not the acting ability of some of the older comediennes. It isn't as memorable as the older models but it is a professional reproduction of the genre. Good family fare."
5,Straight Talk,Just plain fun as aways with Dolly Parton. Film great quality and superb service. If you like to laugh get this movie.
3,okay,"I love to read Angela Knight, but her story was a little short. The last story in the book is the best. Also two men getting it on doesn't do much for me. Over all this book was okay."
2,Coffee Table Book,"This book is ideal for the coffee table but, as an informative book, it doesn't make the cut. The photographs are beautiful but the writing style lacks the punch necessary for how-to books and the reading is made more difficult by the injection of examples of different ""kitchen gardens"" in the midst of the chapters. Also, the gardens discussed are not such as could be duplicated by the average gardener, who does not have several acres of land to turn into a landscaped masterpiece."
5,Great! A few crumbs of new Furs for the hungry masses!,I can't believe this band isn't as famous as the Beatles! One of the more intelligent and haunting bands in the history of Rock and Roll.
4,Great but I miss something,"I Cannot say that I'm a diehard fan of the Furs, but I always like their music since I've heard ""Love My way"", from my point of view this is a great retrospective, but it saddens me that the band puts down such a great record like I think is ""Midnight to Midnight"".Thank god I got the tape and should The Furs forget me."
4,"A ""must have cd"" for fans of the Furs.","I went to summer camp in the mid 1970's with Vince Ely who would eventually become this bands drummer. this is a great collection of songs except it doesn't have the song ""Forever Now"" which should have been on here."
4,Unlisted track,"Fantastic collection, hard to argue with the track selection. One odd thing about this set, though- there is an unlisted track at the end of disc 2, that starts about 30 seconds after the end of 'There's a World'. The mix of this unlisted track sounds like it was a recording of the song bleeding through the walls of another room in the studio. Was wondering if anyone experienced this and if so, what's up with that? The unlisted track itself is an edited version of 'Dumb Waiters', cutting out about 2 minutes of instrumental parts and solos from the album version. It's pretty much unlistenable."
1,BORED TO DEATH,"THE STORY DOESN'T REALLY HAVE A PLOT, IS ALL ABOUT COOKING FOR FHILIPPE, AND HEATHER IS JUST WORRYING ALL THE TIME THAT SHE IS GOING TO BE FOUND OUT, SOMEONE ELSE WAS DOING THE COOKING. IN THE STORY SHE IS PORTRAY AS ASIMPLETON, WHO COULD NOT UNDERSTAND WHY THINGS WERE DISSAPEARING OR APPEARING RIGHT BEFORE HER EYES, AND TO MAKE IT WORSE, SHE WOULD NOT GIVE THEM A 2ND THOUGHT. THIS IS THE FIRST NOVEL THAT I CAN REALLY SAY IT WASTED MY TIME."
4,An Awe-Inspiring Live Album,"An awe-inspiring live album, Black Beauty is basically Bitches Brew live. Recorded April 10, 1970 at Bill Graham's Fillmore West, just days after Bitches Brew was released, this recording captures Miles Davis' band at its most bizarre and psychedelic. Most fascinating of all is Chick Corea, who, at times, makes his electric piano sound like an electric guitar and deals out bursts of Hendrixian feedback and distorted squeals. They occasionally descend into chaos, much as they did on the Bitches Brew sessions, and Steve Grossman is a poor substitute for Wayne Shorter, but when they stick to the songs, they're brilliant. Previously only available as a Japanese import, this album is a fantastic look at live Miles Davis in a unique era when he was really pushing the envelope to explore new territory."
4,Great Electric Era Miles,"This record is a must have for any Miles fan. It presents Miles in a very fluid time in his career, when constant change was the status quo."
3,A nice bit of vintage skronk,"I'd say this is the first ever fusion album with a skronk element. In this case being the abrasive sound of Chick Corea's distorted Fender Rhodes, harshly panned to the left channel. At times he's comping like Jim Hall but the sound is sick! 20 year old saxophonist Steve Grossman catches on in this spirit and plays with urgent manic energy.I like this album for it's rawness and how the band is vamping behind the soloist, giving him adequate freak-out space, which the Fillmore crowd reputedly enjoyed so much, they weren't in the mood for The Dead or The Fudge.The Fillmore East album,with the addition of Keith Jarret by comparison sounds even more chaotic but the sound is not as raw as Black Beauty, and thus sounds a bit meandering."
2,Much like Empress of One,"If novels dealing with sexually troubled young women who are suffering from great mental trauma are your bag -- go ahead and read this one. Although it is well written, the constant fall from sanity expressed in the character Crystal is more than a little depressing -- it is very tiring to read. I loved Fair and Tender Ladies - perhaps because of the character's ability to progress instead of regress. I am not dumping this book altogether -- it was primarily well written; however, a book about the demise of someone who is not written to be a likeable character is like hearing news about someone who does not even qualify as an acquaintance: it is news you do not need to hear. I also saw a lot of similarities in subject in Faith Sullivan's Empress of One, which I did enjoy a bit more than this novel, due in part to the main character having more going for her than just looks and overt sexuality."
2,I agree with others..,"this book just didn't do it for me. I still don't see the point and the ending left me feeling like ""so what"". Lee Smith is a talented writer so I won't give up reading other books by her, but this one won't be on my list of saves."
4,Ending was Abrupt,"I have been enjoying Lee Smith's books. I just discovered her a few weeks ago. I liked the tale of a girl/woman, who definitely represented her time in history and the setting. The ending was abrupt. But after some contemplation, it was probably the most fitting ending that one could write."
4,Beyond Fate,"In Beyond Fate, John Albion takes us into a world of exciting possiblities. Missing persons and UFO's combine to make this a compelling story, with plot twists around every corner. Make a pot of coffee, curl up in a comfy chair, and spend a winter's day following the strange and thought-provoking turns you'll find in this book."
1,Item was defective and this was te second item received,Item was defective and this was te second item received
4,"pretty good, actually",it certainly seems like an evil alliance: a vocalist/violinist known for her quirky pop sensibility and rather unspectacular voice and a guitarist known for doing as much genre-bending as any artist since john zorn (who he played with). but they pulled it off.now admittedly this album isn't for everyone. it requires a sort of melancholy mood. but it's perfect for those late night relaxations after a long day at work.i especially like the cover of coldplay's 'yellow' (a song which i never really liked until i heard this version). also the version of stevie wonder's 'i believe' is spectacular. these two artists have put their own spin on these songs. their originality rivals the recent johnny cash cover albums (r.i.p.).i recommend this disc. it's a good one.
3,Early Petra Haden,"A sweet, pure, voice, singing songs which bring out Petra's fresh qualities. A little reminiscent of Hailey Westnera's Pure. Hopefully this is a springboard to more mature quality as she goes beyond this and ""The Who sell out"""
2,Didn't make it for me,"I enjoy both Petra Haden's voice and Bill Frisell. In this case, the combination of several weak songs and few suprises on the stronger material combined to make this a disappointment. I could see what they could be getting at, but I was underwhelmed."
2,Petra doesn't want to grow up,"Although Petra has a sweet voice, I felt her songs sounded juvenile and scattered."
2,"Heard one song and purchased it,","I heard the only good song on the CD, and purchased it. I should have tried a few more, it's not worth the price."
5,Kooking,"Great recipe book from a great lady! Not hard to understand, but tastes like gourmet cooking. Had some of her cooking, and had to get her book!"
4,Jailhouse Rock,Good music. A great DVD that has fantastic music. Storyline is a bit cheesy but a good movie to watch.
5,great,"Just can't beat Elvis. Great movie. I've watched it many times, but my granddaughter wanted it for her collection. She thought it was a neat movie. Loved the songs and dancing."
5,Gotta love Elvis!,This is a must-have for any Elvis fan's collection. Would definitely recommend this fun movie when Elvis was at his hottest!
4,For Elvis fans,This was his third movie. Not much of a movie but the jail house rock number rocks. I actually enjoyed watching this movie more with the commentary on because this is realy more a nostalgic look at Elvis the movie itself is not that great. But Elvis fans will love the picture and sound quality and commentary.
5,Jailhouse Rock,"I was born in 1943. Elvis was about 4 years beyond my age; but my oldest brother loved him as well as my best girlfriend's sister. She kissed his photo everyday. Her lipstick imprinted lip marks were on his 36'x36' photograph on her bedroom doorWhen i was watching ""True Love"", my favorite Brad Bitt movie, I realized I needed to review Elvis Presely. "" Jailhouse Rock ""was the recommended movie in ""True Love"", so I purchased it and ""Viva Las Vegas"", (I remembered Ann Margaret as the only female actress strong enough to act against Elvis Presely).Let me tell you - ""Jailhouse Rock"" seals Elvis' fame as the superstar of rock. He is completely without ego - totally full of humor, entertainment and presence. He is eternal youth and beauty incarnate.""Jailhouse Rock"" also has a good story line. I remember the times, and the sets and costumes are true. ""Viva Las Vegas"" is frosting on the cake."
1,Jailhouse Rock,This was the worse item I have purchased. The video does not register on any HD Player. I even bought a new one for this specific DVD and it still wouldn't play. I will never purchase any merchandise from this seller again. The rating for this purchase is actually zero. I am very disappointed and I do not understand how people knowingly would sell this type of junk.
1,****STICK TO THE EARLY ORIGINAL ALMBUMS ****,This is from a huge fan. I only had the misfortune of owning this as I was buying the entire catalog in a misguided search for some new sounds. The arrangements of this music have taken great songs with original melodies and muddled them up with a bunch of noise and what's worse - you can tell by the horn sections and high producton values that its not for a lack of budget - these gents have TOTALLY lost the PLOT.The only track on two CDs and a DVD worth keeping was Notorious - and that is one of their most derrivative pop songs. TOTAL CRAP. AVOID.
1,does not deserve any stars,please stay far away from this eighties lousy dance group and this terrible cd where the title explains everything.songs like skin trade and meeting elpresidente sound bad and dated.i would sincerely recommend you to avoid all their lousy albums.get premonition from john fogerty instead.
5,Masterpiece,"Notorious is a phenomenal work of art. I bought and heard their first record, I had heard Rio before that and I thought it was amazing. I decided to buy their 1986 Notorious not knowing what to expect. Duran Duran's Notorious surpassed all my expectation; of the three records I've heard from this group, this album is easily the strongest. It is mature and refined yet still fresh and edgy. It is a great record throughout; here they have created realms in music previously unknown. I'm blown away - five stars."
4,a great album,"if you heard this album then you have a great taste of music .This album contain great tracks like 'american science','vertigo','notourios' 'meet el presdente'and 'a matter of feeling' if you love duran duran like i do ,buy this album"
1,the sound is poor mising some original elements,the recording engineer who mastered the discs is a joke why put this guy to remaster i have the original vinyl and cd of the first edition and is better only the dvd is rescatableim buy this edtion with hight hopes and when im listen the sound is so bad why you remaster with bad architecture emi please remaster again the tape and call tu duran duran to give the okto sound bad for emi very bad for emi
5,Duran Duran CD,Merchandise was delivered as advertised and in a verty timely manner ( actually well before the promised delivery date ). I am very pleased with this seller.
5,The best!,"England's Fab Five strike back with a potent album that silences the haters. Just because they lost two members, it doesn't mean these guys can't rock. I'm lovin' every minute of ""Notorious""!"
2,"Disappointed. Great album...poor ""remaster"" treatment.","If you are interested in Duran Duran, and probably are to a degree if you are reading this...buy the ""Notorious"" CD. It is wonderful, sounds terrific with plenty of synth and impressive horn section. However I do not recommend this ""remastered"" version. Not for the price. I placed it in my CD player and was expected to be blown away by updated sound technology, I was disappointed. Doesn't sound much different than the standard CD released over 2 decades ago. It does come with tons of remixes, live cuts, a DVD of a concert performance, and several postcard size color pics of the band. That is why if you are a completist, or hardcore D2 fan I think you may actually appreciate the extra touches. If you are looking for some music to listen to, save yourself 20 bucks and just get the standard CD."
5,DD's Best Album to date,"I have always liked Duran Duran, and Notorious is definitely a MUST HAVE for all the fans. With the departure of Andy & Roger Taylor, this album definite sounds different from their previous albums. Listen to A MATTER OF FEELING, it gives me a chill. With horns added into their songs - its a definite MUST HAVE!!!"
3,An historical resource for the commited aikidoist.,"This book is valuable to the serious student of aikido in that a series of photographs during a short segment of O-Sensei's (Morihei Ueshiba's) life and practise of aikido can be analyzed. This pictures though were for a specific purpose and I think one or two of the sequences are not correctly replaced from the original work to which they belonged. For those in the aikido community who fuss over at which stage of Ueshiba's practise had the most to offer the modern aikidoist, this book only could stir up the debate. This is not a book that comes off my shelf often to look at exercises to practise, but I appreciate it in my academic approach to the art. Non-the-less, the book belongs in any library on aikido."
1,Don't Bite on This Meatball,"The humorous title, cover illustration, and first one or two chapters of this book draw the reader in, but then it goes nowhere fast. So poorly constructed, disjointed, and preposterous (not in a good way), it's surprising this book was ever published. It feels as though the author came up with a new, crazy, and totally lame plot twist to throw on the page each time he sat down to write. Most of the characters -- adult and child alike -- are despicable. In brief, The Autobiography of Meatball Finkelstein is the literary equivalent of mystery meat. Don't bite on it."
2,Good in parts but...,"Not quite what I was hoping for. This book covers an awful breadth of information, and in doing so wears itself quite thin. The book deals with the role of spirituality in healing fear, which for me, was not at all practical in helping me to address my anxiety. Overall, I found the book to be unfocused and too general to be of any great help."
4,"Excellent, accessible Middle Eastern music","Desert Roses & Arabian Rhythms 2 is an exceptional compilation of Middle Eastern music with an occidental flare. Each week, I play different music at my introductory belly dance classes, and this CD was a definite favourite for my students. The music is accessible for western ears, yet has enough of the eastern sound to be recognizable as something quite different.Standout tracks include Rachid Taha's ""En Retard"" (I love his raunchy-sounding vox and the crunchy and heavy music), Olga Tanon & Hakim's ""Ah Ya Albi"" (upbeat and fun to dance to), Amina's ""Lirrili"" (also fun to dance to), and Cheb Mami's soulful ""Baida.""If you're looking for an introduction to Middle Eastern pop/dance music, this, and Desert Roses & Arabian Rhythms I, are perfect samplers."
3,Typical Sequal,"Unlike the original Desert Roses (which I loves from the first few bars of the 1st song) it took me a while to warm up to it. Though the music is enjoyable to listen to, I don't find it as suitable for belly dancing as the original. Desert Roses 2 is more discoteque/club dancing than belly dancing. For someone looking for modern music for belly dancing, I'd do Desert Roses, then Arabic Groove, and then maybe Desert Roses 2."
4,Great informative biography,"This Biography of Helen Keller was great. It was very informative, I learned a lot about this very determined, wonderful young woman. I even chose to do a report on this for a class. I would reccommend this to anyone interested."
4,TAKE YOUR FRAGRANCE WITH YOU !,"Shi, the fragrance by noted designer Alfred Sung, is reminiscent of his total design philosophy which is classically modern, whether it be clothing, watches or small leather goods. This fragrance is subtle, fresh with a blend of Water Lily and Fig Leaves. Complementing the initial impression is a composition of Orange Blossom and Frangipani, resulting in a soft femininescent.As one would expect the packaging, both bottle and box, is elegant simplicity. Utilizing three of nature's elements, wood, water, and metal, Sung has created a beautiful design. The bottle, a perfectly rounded glass rests on a dark wood base. On top of the cap is the Chinese symbol for water. Viewed as a whole, the bottle reminds one of a perfect drop of water.The box is a pale blue with the Chinese water symbol on the top panel.This fragrance would certainly be appropriate for day or evening."
2,Not his best,"This is a long way from Paul Theroux's best. You can see he already had the sharp, iconoclastic world view that makes so much of his later and better writing so good. But this is a nasty and unpleasant book, and doesn't do anything to reward you for getting through it. The characters are pretty much uniformly unsympathetic, bad stuff happens to a lot of people who may or may not deserve it. Waldo himself is terribly hard to identify with...not worth hunting for."
4,Realistic and enjoyable.,"As a veteran of the Sixth Fleet I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It is well written by an author that has actually spent a career in the Navy, not just learned about it through research. This is an excellent first work by an author with great talent. I finished this book yesterday and started the next in the series today, happy to see it pick up just where this one left off. I recommend this book for those that want the ""true"" realistic flavor of our modern military."
5,Military Techno Thriller - The Sixth Fleet,"David Meadows has captured a realistic scenario that keeps the reader riveted. His accuracy is uncanny, after completing this book our legislators should be called upon to read this and take a look at the present situation in the world. I eagerly look forward to his next book."
5,Great Book!,"An exciting and realistic tale of combat in the 21st century. This is one of the best books I've read about modern naval operations this decade. You can tell that the author has 'been there.' A well written, fast read; one of the most enjoyable books I've read this year. Hope he writes more soon!"
5,Wolves of Willoughby Chase,"My children are in their 20's now and remember this movie as children. We would like their younger siblings to have it's viewing experience. When can it get on DVD? We also listened to the book on tape while on a rainy vacation, it was wonderful!"
3,boring,"It's hard to preview this kind of music before buying it, with only the short snips Amazon provides to judge it by, so I took a chance. Unfortunately I find everything on this compilation very boring and regret purchasing it- it reminds me (unfavorably) of being trapped at a church service for hours. Waste of $10."
1,Disappointing,"There are a number of problems with this book.First, there are way too many difficult/unusable chord forms that you are supposed to memorize. These are not the forms that are used by most real jazz guitarists. Joe Pass never played 80% of these chord forms.Second, there are only a few useful ideas presented and the same text is repeated over and over to fill 150 pages. The author uses a strange hard-to-use notation to symbolize chords instead of just using the normal block diagrams.Finally, the main thrust of this book is to show how you can play all the different chord types with every note of the scale on top. That's not a very useful scenario."
4,This thing really works!,"My sister gave this to me for Christmas. I really didn't know what to expect, but it ended up working really well. You just start with clean dry hair & comb it through your hair & it gives you a nice haircut. They say it's intended to maintain your style in-between regular haircuts, but I'm going to try to use it all the time to save money. It pays for itself in just one use. The thing I like is that it comes with a DVD that shows how to use it. It also comes with lube for the blades, 2 types of combs, and a barber's cape. If you're on the fence, go for it."
1,Coundnt cut air.,"Product came on time, brand new seller delivered as promised great on his/her/thier behalf. But this has to be the worst Wahl clipper every invented. Glad it was heavily discounted for 8 bucks. I just don't know what wahl was thinking and who hair they had in mind ?. Best it doesn't cut all hair as stated, it will be going to charity."
1,wait a second!,"before buying it... I spent a lot of time comparing all these kind of products and then had a look at the Wahl website. Saw actually two videos on this product. It LOOKED great and I bought it. The problem is you have to be a professional to cut your hair by yourself. There is only one cutting mode, only one speed and the cutter vibrates a lot, so your hand must be firm. I did not expect this poor kind of service and I returned it, but for experienced people can be a good and inexpensive solution."
3,EARINGS,"Was looking for cute & dainty earings for every day. They are very cute but tiny in person. They are depicted as being much bigger than they actually are on website pics...The price was right, so am not at all disappointed."
5,Great British Blues Rock!,"One reviewer above here got it wrong: TYA aren't Southern rockers--they are from England. And they play the best Blues rock ever!I grew up with TYA ever since my older brother had many of their albums (and in even had a poster of Alvin hanging up in the hallway as we go downstairs from upstairs).Alvin is an amazing guitarist and this collection includes so many of their best songs.One I would include? ""The Stomp"" (from ""Sssh"").Note : Alvin has a new solo album called ""Saguitar"" (2008) and TYA have a young kid replacing Alvin , with Leo , Chick and Ric still in tow...How could anyone replace Alvin?!?"
3,Sounds like guys pretending to be rock stars,"My credentials: I bought Cricklewood Green when it was new, and listened to it until I wore it out. I still think it is a fine example of that 60s English bluesy sound. Alvin got more pretentious and smug later; but he had grown from guitar flailer to competent composer/arranger. This was the peak, and it remains a great distance from their nearest plateau.When the best songs are extracted from a well listened to LP, the effect is somewhat jarring. And in this case, when the best songs left out are replaced by not-as-good songs in the name of completeness, it is especially unsatisfying. I think I'll continue listening to Cricklewood Green, and put this on the shelf. If you want to explore this band, try that. If you need an ""essential"" collection, I ask why? This is not bad, just not as satisfying as the source."
5,Definitely Sanford's Best!!!,"Sanford has definitely outdone himself. A bunch of new and excellent characters. Lucas even meets his soul mate man friend. I don't usually fall for the ""you can't put this book down"" but it's true this time."
4,An Edge of Your Seat Thriller!,"This is the first John Sandford novel that I've ever read, and I really enjoyed it. It probably would have been better to have read some of the earlier books in the series in order to understand the history of Clara Rinker and Lucas Davenport, but the author does a pretty good job of bringing the reader up to date with this book. I found that the book had me cheering for the bad girl, as well as the good guys, and I was absolutely glued to the tape machine to hear what happened next. The story is about a female hit lady (the best in the business), and her personal vendetta to right wrongs done to her and to the man that she loved. She has a list of four names that she wants to wreak her vengeance on, and we see how brilliant she is in accomplishing this. Even more notable when the four names are names very high up in organized crime in St. Louis. I now need to read more Lucas Davenport books!"
5,Another Great Job!,"This is another excellent Lucas Davenport book by John Sandford - - actually, one of his best. I would be very interested to see what Sandford could do with a clean sheet of paper; not constrained by the Lucas Davenport character."
3,Guess I'm out of the loop,"This is not my favorite Sanford book...that would be Winter Prey. While I was intrigued to see Clara Rinker back again to haunt Lucas, I guess I just felt that the mystery aspect of this one was a little weak. The ending seemed too predictable to me.Now that Lucas has put Rinker behind him, and his house is built,and his baby is born, he might go on to bigger and better mystery lines. Here's to the next Sanford novel. However, I did enjoy the ex-cops he met in this book. They rocked!"
3,good read,"Another good read after several boring ones by Sandford, but brother what a BOGUS ending.You have to love Clara Rinker, and Sandford betrays her in this one. Everything goes along swimmingly, then that ending. Ugh.Fun, then a lingering disappointment."
5,Taken First Place,"My Mother started me on the Sandford mysteries after the birth of my son with ""Winter Prey."" I haven't been able to resist any of them since. Until the release of ""Mortal Prey"", ""Winter Prey"" was my favorite...not I'm torn. This one is G-R-E-A-T! If you're a Sandford fan, don't miss this one! If you're not, (heaven forbid!), read this one and you'll want them all!"
3,Great (if you like this kind of thing),"I started this literally because I liked the cover (not the one pictured here on the Amazon site BTW). Anyway, I'm not big on these police thriller things, but if you are this one will surely suit you. It's a straightforward page turner and the sympathetic quality of the serial killer is a big factor in this."
4,Solid Mystery,"John Sandford's popular Detective Davenport is back, this time on the hunt for mafia hitwoman Clara Rinker.And much as you have to like the roguish Davenport, it's hard not to cheer for Rinker. She's returned from her hideout in Mexico, where she'd started a new life with a new man -- and a baby on the way.Discovered by her old mafia friends, Rinker barely survives an assassination attempt -- losing her boyfriend and her baby in the same tragic instant.And now she wants revenge.Can Clara kill her would-be killers?Can Davenport bring her to justice?I won't give anything else away, other than to tell you that you're going to have an awful lot of fun -- and some awfully late nights -- finding out."
4,Action-Packed,I'm a first time reader of John Sandford. I must say I throughly enjoyed myself. It is a must read. Clara and Lucus were great antagonists it was great start to finish.
4,Major faux pas,"John Sanford is my all-time favorite writer. However, the editing has gone awry in this book. Hurried to meet deadlines? It appears 2 scenes were written in which Lucas Davenport takes Rinkers' phone call. Both are included in the book causing confusion and giving me difficulty in finishing it."
2,Not the best,"I like Sandford. I really do. This wasn't his best. the basic concept is good and it starts off well, but its all chat between Lucas and the FBI and a couple of retired cops in St. Louis. What Lucas Davenport is doing as part of an official investigation in St. Louis is ... well, he was asked by the FBI to be part of the team, but in the real world I don't see that happening. Anyway, its all talk and very little action. I liked that the killer they were searching for was an incredibly intelligent woman. That is that she was smart enough to get away with it for many years. Before I read this book, I read Easy Prey. Fast paced, keeps you at night turning the pages. this one... put me to sleep. The end was exciting though. :-)"
1,mortal prey,have not rec'd item was given a delivey window 1/13 to 1/31. as of today i have nothing will file if my rec'd by 2/7
1,Mortal Prey -- DOA,"Man, it sucks when you have a best seller that uses the same paragraphs, almost word for word in two different chapters. It took me 20 minutes to figure out I was on the right page. I had to go back to page 163 to a phone call between Rinker and Lucas to figure out that it was not a tape recording or a flash of Deje Vu on my part, when they have the same conversation on page 174. This also screws up the hole story line, because Rinker already used the information in the first call to inform the press. And now it seems like the two never made contact at all. Lucas even gives her his cell number twice. I almost chucked the book in the can. Unfortunantly I usually share my books with others, but this one will go out with the monday trash. I was hoping for a good read, not a test of my reading comprehension.Don't frustrate yourself with this book.Consider it DOA."
4,Likeable Villain Returns.....,"Another good one from Sandford. Not sure that this ranks in the upper echelon of Prey books, but it is pretty good. We know Lucas well by now, and most of his supporting cast. We even know the killer from a previous novel. All characters have depth and Sandford delivers a strong plot all the way through. If I had one complaint or criticism it would be that the story slowed a bit towards the end. Not awful, just not as strong as some of the others. I love this series."
2,Mortal prey,"Of the Davenport books I've read, and I've read most of them- this one only gets two stars! While I love all Sanford books, I found this one to be boring. The author got too bogged down in details about the stake outs and searches for the elusive killer and did not have the usual balance of character building and the dynamic between the different players in the story. I thought the endingwas predictable. I look forward to getting excited about the next book of his I read! Diana"
4,4.5 Stars - Another quality effort from John Sandford,"Yet another excellent book in the Lucas Davenport ""Prey"" series. This book finds Lucas in St. Louis, on the trail of an old nemesis, Clara Rinker. Ex-hitwoman Rinker has been forced out of hiding, and Davenport is called in to assist the FBI in trying to stop her latest killing spree. As usual, this is another quick read, filled with interesting plot twists, and some new interesting characters. One of my few complaints is that Sandford does some heavy foreshadowing of one particular plot twist in the book, so that when it comes, it is no surprise at all.This book is 354 pages long."
3,"Our favorite characters are back, but that's about all folks","Lucas Davenport again faces off with a nemesis, Clara Rinker. The book starts off extraordinarily slowly but builds to a typical Sandford twisted ending. The character development was the best part of the book, while the plot remained less than stellar. I believe that while Lucas Davenport has been a terrific continuum for Sandford, he may need to find new characters so that he can develop some new story lines."
4,Back to quality,"One of the best in the Prey series. Much more believable protagonist then in Chosen Prey, may be because the reader can see how and why Carla is a psychopath. Plus the new characters in Davenports gang seem real.I also like being able to follow Carla as She evades both the law and the gang.If you have read and enjoyed the others in this series, you will enjoy this, plus the follow on books have been setup in a minor way.A friend I lent it to liked the way the reader is hooked from the beginning, without having to read 50 pages to figure out what is going on. She enjoyed and had never read any of the others in the series."
4,"Outstanding local research, excellent story","When I grabbed the book to read, it was the story description that sold me. I was surprised, therefore, to discover that the tale takes place almost literally in my own back yard, since I live in the metropolitan St. Louis area. Sandford's research was excellent. I wasn't really able to spot anything I could fault him on. For a local, this made the read even more interesting since I was able to visualize everything much more easily.The story itself initially was a bit disjointed in the setup, but came together quickly. I found Clara Rinker to be a sympathetic villainess, and at times I was even pulling for her, much to my surprise. Her motivations and who the real bad guys were at times were a bit complex.There were things to tug at the heart, and at times you had to wonder ""why are there so many pages left?"" because it seemed so likely the story had to close soon. Sandford found a way to turn the tables, of course.I was very pleased with the book."
5,Clara Rinker Returns,"This book brings back Clara Rinker and closes loose ends from a previous book. I loved it and was kind of sorry for Clara. John Standford did it again, great book with real suspense and what is going to happen next questions to be answered."
4,Mortal Prey,"This is the first John Sandford book I have read. The author provides his readers with a well written, action packed, suspenseful story. The Clara Rinker character was well developed. I really liked the twist at the end. I am looking forwarding to reading more of John Sandford's books."
5,Duel of the masters,"John Sandford's tough, smart cop, Lucas Davenport, is up against Clara Rinker, the best hit-woman in the business. It's a rematch.Sandford deserves monuments: his writing is smooth, his characters rich, his plots greased with flawless efficiency.You can pick any of Sandford's fifteen or so ""Prey"" thrillers and be swept into a world of good people and bad; of justice and injustice.Lucas Davenport feels real. He hurts. He makes mistakes. He gets tired, cold and hungry. He is definitely not invulvernable. But he is smart and dogged.He's a fictional treat because he feels so real. And John Sandford is to be profusely thanked for not only his creation but for his growth from one ""Prey"" novel to the next.Jerry"
4,outstanding,Great read but of course I am biased I love Lucas Davenport. He is smooth and tough with a dash of debonaire thrown. Felt really bad about Clara's brother though Lucas would have pushed harder to get him released. Clara's lost a lot; kind of expect her to want revenge. -
3,Emotional Intelligence--Theory,"The book starts off with information about how the brain has EVOLVED through evolution, as if it was a fact. This is just an assumption on the part of the writer.The rest of the book is an interesting rendering of how thought processes are separate from academic intelligence.The author provides information on how emotions can be controlled and self-managed in order to make better decisions for a stable emotional state.The book does have some sound advice and does mention specific testing that has been done.Interesting book for those who like to delve into thought processes."
3,eq concept is marshal mcluan's crap detecting 90's style.,"marshall mcluan inventor of ""medium is the message"" media futurist talked of crap detecting and some people can read others well not using sylogistic logic and memory,cognitive,convergent learning methods. trying to make ""common"" sense above intelligence"
1,Emotional Intelligence is as Important as IQ,I wanted this book so bad I bought it as soon as it came out in hardcover. I read it and found nothing of real use to me in it. Why can't people see that this book has a great title but little or no substance that will help you develop emotional intelligence and success. Did I mention it has a great title?
1,Academic Writing Style,"It could be a really good book with lots of insights to provide; however, it failed to grap my attention with the draggy way of writing. It came on as boring as ever, I even tried to pick a few topics which I might be interested in to read, to no avail. It was too painstakingly boring and lengthy to go to a point, if there's even a point, I just couldn't sustain long enough to get there.I have no doubt that it is a great book in self-help, just not my kind."
5,my eyes are open,"This book opened my eyes for the first time!The cookie-test he describes finally explains why people with self-control, people who know how to control their emotions have more success than those who do not.Great book that made my life easier."
3,Emotional Skill Often Trumps Intellect,"Goleman argues that our society has placed far too much emphasis on measuring intellectual capability and far too little on measuring emotional capability. Emotions often play an equally important, and sometimes greater, role in a person's success.Emotional intelligence is defined as emotive skills, including self-motivation, empathy and social competence in interpersonal relationships. As one of the first writers to popularize this topic, Goleman opened up a discussion that advances beyond simplistic pop-psychology.In the end, Goleman offers less in terms of substance and more in terms of still-open questions. However, his core idea is that intelligence alone is a much less important factor of success than intelligence combined with emotional skill. This idea alone is worth the investment to read the book."
3,Information is good but difficult to read,"I found lots of useful information in the book but it reads like legaleese. Example: ""Fortunately, the catastropic moments in which traumatic memories are emblazoned are rare duing the course of life for most of us."" I'm a pretty fast reader but this took me a long time to read. Maybe it is because the kids kept interrupting and I kept having to reread. I do recommend it but wish it was easier to read."
1,"No facts, just a mass market money maker.","The problem with Emotional Intelligence is that it offers no sound facts. Whenever the author refers to a study, he offers no solid numbers or facts. He blinds the reader into accepting his conclusions. What about study size and statistical information? Anyone can find a study to fit their particular theory, and he has. This is a sorry attempt to mass market a book for only one reason, to make money. People interested in psychology would do better to read the classics: Freud, Skinner, Beck, Bandura and the like."
2,"All theory, no practical tips","This book has been cited by several authors, so I was looking forward to it. The book is very pedantic, with very few examples and even fewer tips on HOW to apply ""EI"" to our lives. The only chapter I enjoyed was the one that describes the mother-child bond that reptiles lack.Dr. Daniel Amen's ""Change your brain, change your life"" is far more practical."
2,Not much here,"Goleman introduces brain anatomy to describe how the brain processes emotions - expecially the amygdala and the neo-cortex. Brain Anatomy is assumed to be a result of Darwinistic evolution. Much of the book states the obvious. Emotional health contributes to success. Emotional awareness contributes to emotional health. The benefits of religious conviction on emotional health are not mentioned at all!. If you value your time, skip directly to the appendices. There is some good stuff there."
3,A good (not must) read for parents,"The premise of this book is that self-control of one's emotions is just as important to life-long success as the oft-mentioned Intelligence Quotient. The author spends much of book detailing strategies that can be summarized as being aware of your emotional state, then being able to control it. Strategies such as anger management, empathy, impulse control and conflict resolution, among others, are touched upon. The structures of the brain that control and act upon our emotions are discussed also. This book might be better suited for parents as Mr. Goleman asserts the best time to learn these skills is in childhood although methods adults can use to improve these skills are also included."
3,"Good info, very bad written","Mr. Goleman shows with this book two things: that E.I. really matters, and that he doesn't know how to write. I've almost finished the book, and had counted 26 times the phrase ""as Dr. ... told me,"" buagh! This book is full of knowledge (very few from Mr. Goleman, if any at all), and deserves a read even againts its author."
3,Not a light read for sure!,"I was recommended this book when I mentioned some very ""normal"" office behavior. The first few chapters lays a nice foundation on emotional intelligence and where it stems from. I found the later chapters very useful. However, I was not looking for as much depth-this felt more like a text book for a beginner psychologist.Else I would have rated it anywhere between 3 and 4.This book did explain a lot of nuances I notice in day to day life, stress at work, family interactions and relationship, and yes explains even behavioral patterns in babies- and why baby boys are baby boys and gals..gals.!Nice read, would recommend this book, but not if you are looking for a light introduction to EQ."
5,Revolutionary,"10 years ago , when I read this book I was a very young determined manager, strong willed, and dedicated to work, however in my opinion I was to concentrated on reaching the business objectives loosing sight of the power of people and team, I though I could do it by my own: Wrong!. This book has been stricking, and started to change the perception I had so far of the qualities necessary for a good leader, it has been a continuos challenge for me over the years to put in practice its learnings, and often I have to review it.... a must have for anyone wanting to become a better person in business or in life."
3,Psych 101 anyone - Goleman Style?,"Very thought-out book. I believe the author may have posted new thought to B.S psychology. No real new discoveries except for his interpretations of the complexity of the human mind, some ideas I question.I gave Mr. Goleman only one star due his lack of composition skills ... give this text to the commom layman would only produce boredom. His writing is riddled with technical jargon and complex analysis (some which have no scientific preface). I nearly fell asleep reading the book, myself. His writing style wins no awards for appeal, dynamic, or readability; otherwise, his idea and analysis are interpretations which really does not proof emotional human output - every human response differently to different situations in life."
4,Interesting topic,"In this book the author manages to shine some light on an interesting topic which, unfortunately, is not getting enough attention especially in schools and universities. The best thing about the book is that every claim the author makes is backed up with a scientific experiment or a practical example from the real world. The bottom line is that if you have enough experience and knowledge, you may get the job, but in order to advance, or even keep your job, you should have emotional intelligence. Some of the things in the book are common sense, but the author shows us how much they really affect our performance."
2,"Great Material, Lousy Writing","This book has such great potential, but the reader is forced to slog through pages upon pages of text that reads more like a graduate research paper than a self-help book.If the author could refrain from using obscure literary references and trying to impress the reader with his expansive vocabulary, the messages he is trying to convey would be much clearer.The material presented here is invaluable but the writing totally makes it undesirable."
2,slow to get here,"by the time it arrived it was on the back burner of things to read,however my friend in calf. who turned me on to it can't say enough good things about it:)"
2,"Unconvicing and unenlightening, when not obvious","Derivative and superficial. The folksy examples starting each section are primitive. Prescriptive parts are dubious, such as the ""Self-science"" class for fifth-graders: no grades, ""sophisticated"" notions like: anger is derivative from jealousy. So, why not call it psychology and give grades? Some underlying assumptions seem dubious, such as one about ""natural"" empathetic tendencies being occluded by cruelty (is it supposed to be less ""natural"" than empathy?). The role of heredity may be wishfully understated or avoided throughout. Besides, is IQ - a general ability to deal with complexity - really altogether uncorrelated with the ability to analyze complex human emotions, your own included??"
1,Pseudoscience and quackary at its best,"This advice is primarily written to those who do not know about how to conduct and read science: DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BOOK.Emotional intelligence is voodoo science at its best. It sounds intuitively appealing but there nothing behind it. Plenty of research has now been undertaken and guess what? According to a recent meta-analysis (an integration of many studies) EQ correlates very weakly with work performance (in fact about 3 times less that does IQ--go ahead, take a look at the Journal of Vocational Behavior, a credible and well-respected scientific journal to check the accuracy of my statement).But Goleman preaches the opposite; speculating where he shouldn't be. What he's done and currently doing is shocking and unethical. It seems that he's only in it for the money; or maybe, he's just not as smart (IQ!) as he makes out to be."
5,Incredible...,"This book explains in a clear and thorough fashion the ""why"" people interact with each other the way they do, and the importance of empathy. It really explains the what and the why, but not the ""how-to"" in improving your emotional intelligence."
5,He put Emotional Intelligence on the map,"This is a classic. He described all the different ways in which human beings express unique aspects of emotional intelligence. He makes a strong case that overall emotional intelligence is more important than IQ regarding reaching overall happiness and success in life. You just have to look all around you in every day life, and observe that what he is saying holds true.If human beings were solely intellectually intelligent, they would eventually all be replaced by a good computer with a good decision making software package. Watch out the Matrix would take over.Fortunately, this is not so. Our lives are far more complex, and can't be run by binomial decisions. Everything is associated with judgment calls. It is all shades of gray. In such a domain, emotions, intuition, empathy, sensitivity, and awareness rule. The intellect is just a wonderful tool serving these other masters. The Matrix will never rule."
3,Sociological Waffle!,"Several uninteresting chapters contribute to what only can be described as self indulgent,wordy trash. Put in a nutshell - money for old rope!"
3,Thought it was going to have more substance,Although there was alot of detail and thought put into this book. I don't feel like I got much out of it. The guy just goes on and on about things to a point where I felt he was being self-indulgent. It's not a total loss just thought it could have been more. Not sure why everyone thinks it's so great.
5,Excellent Text,This was the required text for a class. It was interesting and insightful. I would read as a self help book.
4,EI,A good book giving a clear insight into a interesting area. The information is new to me and I found it a fairly easy read.
3,Dry,"The content of the book is okay, but I couldn't get into it. Much of the early book he ventures hypothesis, saying things like ""this is currently being tested"" or ""one day we hope to prove"". Not really hard science if you ask me."
3,Not what I expected,"This book started off with a wonderful detailed description of how the brain functions, spends the middle two-thirds explaining why we need to be able to identify and deal with our emotions when we are young, and then closes with real life examples where the principals have been used(schools) along some results. Makes a valid agruement for dealing with/becoming aware of our emotions during our youth but does not do much for the mature adult who wants to improve their own emotional intelligence. Ideal for a parent or any school administrator considering this type of course for their schools curriculum."
3,This not a how to book...,"I really liked this book despite the 3 star rating. The problem is that it basically describes what it is, and not how to use the info in making your own emotional IQ better. But, I do reccommend this book, and I think a lot of people should read it as it is applicable. Just wish there were more how to's in this book."
3,Two Complaints,"Complaint number one -- are the things discussed in this book really ""emotional"" matters? Some seem (to this psych major) to be aspects of personality, not facets of emotion.Complaint number two -- I'm a little wary of the degree to which emotional intelligence as defined here dovetails with conformity to the behavior of a Good Corporate Employee."
2,Not a great book but worthwhile to skip through...,"I read the first twenty pages or so and started to feel bored because the author inundated his book with too many so called scientific findings and details on brain. All I want to know is how to deal with emotions of myself and others in a productive way.This book can be shorter, briefer, and clearer in giving some insight and cure on emotional issues we are facing.I am happy that I didn't buy this book but borrowed from a local library."
1,not good,they sent me a really old edition from 1995 even though their description was a newer one from the past couple years.... the cover picture is not even the same. not impressed and it took forever to get to me.
4,Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Thank IQ,First time researching this topic having heard about the popularity of the topic when it first hit the shelves. Good reading - not so technical making it easy read but with specific exmaples/evidence demonstrating expertise.
5,New post-IQ era opening book?,"I was the typical all (almost always) A+ grade-getting student, and I thought this would guarantee a successful life... but it wasn't...once in college, and 5 yrs after, when I saw my classmates (who usually would not get better than B or C's at school) were getting married and started having happy family life, and when i saw myself still majoring a 2nd and even a 3rd studies (and even oversees)... i realized that it was not all about IQ....so 11yrs after i graduated high school, i run into this great book, I had wished I had read it 15 (or 20) yrs ago~!I guess that the whole world education system has to switch to this new way of seeing human intelligence... and life..."
5,I found this book well worth reading,This book does a great job of explaining the interactions between the logical part of the brain and the emotional part of the brain. I studied psychology 20 years ago in college. It is amazing how much more has been learned about the human body since that time. This book includes many case studies about what happened when various parts of the brain were removed or damaged due to cancer or some other malady. Reading this book has helped me to keep a better check on my emotions when in stressful situations.
3,HUH?,"With Eating disorders crippling women, I was dismayed that Daniel was emotiionally defiecet in what he is trying to teach: EMPATHY. THe short, brief section on eating disorders was irresponible for what is a COMPLEX disorder that is not so simple. Daniel does not even look at the societial demands that are placed on women (we have not even passed the ERA yet for christ sakes, women are not seen as equal by societies standards, of course this would cause one to distort and malprocess their emotions) He is actually blaming these women for something that has not been taught to them and denied them in this dominating male society; women's emotions have been stifled for centuries. Daniel is not an expert here on eating disorders, in fact I find his quick look at this problem as GLIB and absoulutley without empathy...The solution was SO intellectualized I had to laugh, how ironic."
3,Emotional Intelligence,The book was in decent condition. I have not been able to read it yet. It came in a timely manner.
3,Maybe not as good as some others.....,"This book speaks of all the ways in which we can learn to interpret the world and the people in it through emotions. The concepts are very good and can be extremely helpful.I was so excited to get this book, and read it. But then I was slightly disappointed. Perhaps it was because I had read so many other books prior to reading this one.I just think there might be other books that either go into each concept a little more in depth, or are a lot more fun to read. Yes, I like it when books flow with inspiration or enjoyment. This one was a little stilted and I just wasn't satisfied after finishing it. I wanted more examples and more meaning behind them.Some of the concepts were also ""old hat"" for me - I didn't learn as much as I had hoped. It wasn't as ""ground breaking"" as advertised. If you are new to this type of psychological understanding, it's a definite ""reading list"" item."
3,Half A Book,The first half of the book was well worth the money I paid. I believe his facts are solid and the information is useful in understanding the role of emotional IQ in our daily lives. But the last half of the book reads like a liberal agenda for tax-payer funded social programs.
3,Attempt at turning soft issues into tangible items,"I think that this author's research is worthy of a perusing. Although the reading is not very fluid, I find his concepts commendable. If more people would give the ""soft stuff"" a harder look, I think this world would be a lot better off. This author does a fairly good job at rationalizing the irrational."
1,Don't do it,"Wow, this was a bad CD, I'm very happy that I didn't pay full price for this stinker. After wading through the usual pop psychology I came to the conclusion this CD was very basic and didn't any offer advice on how to use or grow your EI. If I had a time machine I'd go back in time, meet myself, and tell me not to waste my time or money. You'd be better served looking up the topic on Wiki."
1,Common knowledge!,I thought this book would introduce me to how to use IE in daily life or how it can be a useful tool. It just outlines why it matters to teach it in schools and so forth.
5,A book that gives a new concept to the language,"The concept of ' Emotional Intelligence ' is at the center of this work. Goleman says that mere I.Q. is not enough to understand the likelihood of someone 's success in the world. He indicates a more important factor what he calls ' emotional intelligence'. By this he means self- awareness, persistence, empathy and the ability to understand and sympathize with the feeling of another. I do not know the social -science research in this area very well. But his concept did seem to confirm something that I had seen in a number of situations i.e. that it is peoples' ability to get along with other people which is a key element in many forms of life and work success. Perhaps I simply but this book makes a good case for this, providing also a large number of examples as confirmation."
2,"Lacks the ""how to""!","The book is an excellent reference for the scientific or the person doing research on this subject. Howver, if like me, you would like to develop your own skills and are not already relatively good at it, look for an other book.I would recommend this one to someone interested in the medical and scientific background and research on emotional intelligence. For practical applications look further."
2,"A 10th Anniversary release, not a revision","This book, in 1995, was and continues to be a classic and a good read. So why two stars? Today, in 2012, 17 years after the original publication, so much more is known, and there is so much more that should be added that this book is in need of a serious and extensive rewrite. If one is using this book as part of series of books and papers on this important topic, then the book in it's original form is where you must start.But, as a single source of information, it is not so useful. There is so much more solid information available now that should be incorporated and balances the cognitive and emotional aspects from high quality brain research and research in education: How Learning Works, Talent is Overrated, Mindset, Whatever it Takes, Reaching for Manhood, Voices of Determination, How Children Succeed, and many more."
2,Boring,"Lots of narratives telling about cases when the emotional sense overcomes the reason, but honestly I was expecting some clues to develop myself, not just stories and examples that simply don't fit for a regular person."
4,The standard for info on emotional intelligence,"The standard and a very good introduction to social-emotional intelligence. There is a good bit of the book that concerns SEI programs in schools, but these would have been enhanced with some practical applications/exercises that educators could use in their classrooms."
2,worthwhile,"I needed this book for a Masters course I was taking. It was informative and interesting how it applies to many applications in medicine, business, teaching, etc..."
2,A new paradigm for intelligence or... common sense?,"Daniel Goleman, the new guru of emotional intelligence claims that he found a new scientific paradigm for intelligence. Reading the book it seems more that his paradigm is only common sonse about the human behavior. It's a ligth analysis of this complex subject, good if you like talk with a friends about a fashion matter, after a good diner but...without profundity, of course!.."
1,Why it is a bestseller?,"Did you know that stress, anxiety, anger are not exactly the best for your wealth?Can you believe that often pedofils, assassins, molesters haven't had a joyful infancy?Could you ever think that your character develop much more during your youth than when you are full grown up?Maybe that when you are worried, upset or depressed your mind can't really judge at its best.If the answer is yes to all these questions, then you don't need this book. It will be only a waste of time and patience.This book is merely a collection of popular savvy mixed with obvoius, but accademically irreproachable, studies referencies.And of course, if you are looking for a guilty, he is the amigdala."
2,surprised,"I was surprised that the audio book was abridged - I didn't notice that when purchasing.More importantly, I expected drills and insights for improving my emotional intelligence. Instead, it discussed psychological studies that show its importance."
2,Emotional Intelligence: Why you will need an IQ of 140 to read and understand this book!,"I did not enjoy reading this book.While many of the concepts presented are no doubt accurate and often enlightening, there is just far too much use of unecessarily complex and obscure language. You just about need to have a Thesaurus handy to interpret the text along the way.Unless you are a master of the english language and enjoy the challenge of understanding words you have never heard on a sentence to sentence basis, do yourself a favour and invest in one of the other great texts available with regard to understanding the importance of recognising, controlling and utilising the emotional reactions of the human psyche."
4,People Smarts,"Emotional Intelligence by Daniel Goleman has been around a long time, I only wish I had read it sooner, especially when my kids were little. One of my daughters was naturally high in EI but kept comparing herself with her two siblings who were more gifted in the IQ department. She kept saying she felt ""dumb."" I think I would have had more tips on how to encourage her and make that period of her life smoother. The second half of the book has a lot of material for teachers and educators. There is also a book based on this same concept called Primal Leadership which I read as a follow up. It applies this understanding to the workplace and would be of interest to employers and managers.Also very helpful, though I found this one a bit repetitive."
3,"Good Concept, Bad Execution","This book gets 4-5 stars for content, but 1-2 stars for readability, so an average of a 3.Books written by academics who are more interested in impressing their peers than communicating clearly really annoy me. So what would otherwise be a fascinating, engaging topic becomes unnecessarily boring. (But not the worst I've ever read).So, if you have a low tolerance for complex, unreadable, boring, run-on sentences, a better alternative is his other book, Primal Leadership. With the benefit of two co-authors, it's much tighter and more readable. However, because Primal Leadership is focused on adults, it doesn't include many of the discussions of children and developmental learning -- which was valuable -- but only if you can get through it.Hopefully he'll come out with a second edition, with the help of a professional writer. Since I'd love to be able to give it 5 stars."
5,An Intelligent Look at Intelligence,"Daniel Goleman's ""Emotional Intelligence"" is a refreshingly intelligent book on the issue of intelligence. Shackled by ""intelligence"" tests and by curricula that define such topics as the arts and music as peripheral, we have come to assume a far too narrow definition of intelligence - and of ourselves. Goleman blasts through those constraints and thoughtfully reminds us that we are far more than our SAT scores. This is a very important book historically. Another important book you should read is The 2,000 Percent Solution by Mitchell, Coles and Metz, that presents effectiveness in a way both enlightened and practical - like Goleman, seeing us as who we really are and guiding us in using our full emotional potential to do our best in this life. May there be many more books like these!"
3,"in the right direction, but not fully convincing","I'm about halfway through reading this book.FYI, I'm not a psych major or an academic.Generally, I think this guy is really ""on the righttrack"" - I am willing to buy into his ideas at first,but I don't find his arguments quite as satisfyingas they need to be ... he seems often to makeindirect use of others' research to support hisown distinct hypotheses - and often says theconnection is ""obvious"". Not very rigorous.that being said, I do think EI and EQ are really""onto something important"", something thatis largely missing from our public educationsystem, and something worth pursuing. If thisis the most rigorous treatment to date, thenwhat we must do is fund more research toprove the claims in this book by more directmethods."
2,Somewhat Useless,"I found some of what he said intriguing. I agree with his assertion that ""emotional intelligence"" is more important than IQ, but there seems very little realistic chance in improving your EQ if you weren't born with it. (Goleman certainly doesn't present any good ideas on how). Goleman seems somewhat unsophisticated in his view of how people can improve their EQ. Read Howard Gardner. His books are much more substantial, providing better analysis and more complex, viable solutions."
4,Good Book,An excellent book for anyone who enjoys psychology and self improvement. The one downside is that the last quarter of the book focuses on education reform for schools and why we should implement emotional intelligence into curriculum (as to how you yourself can implement EI into your own life).
4,Intense Reading,"Before purchasing this book, I read may reviews and had high expectations.For me, this book was hard to read. I would compare this to a Intro Psy textbook, not light reading.There is much good information here. I enjoyed the sections on the physical aspects and development of the brain. I also enjoyed the sections on emotional connections to management, marriage, and health."
4,Dynamic Life,Daniel Goleman's book Emotional Intelligence is a very easy to understand read. He makes it very clear that academic intelligence has little to do with emotional life. Those with a high IQ may not possess the emotional skills to deal effectively with others or what we call people skills.The concepts Mr. Goleman espouses concerning a different way of being smart are clearly defined and well articulated. Congratulations Mr. Goleman on a brilliant book on a subject that doesn't seem to be given enough weight in measuring human intelligence.This book has afforded me greater insight into and confirmation of the importance of positive motivation in personal development.Emotional Intelligence will definitely be part of Dynamic Life Enterprise's reference library.James D. A. Terry[...].
4,"Great, insightful, intelligent read","This book, explains, scientifically how/why we act/react the way we do and emphasizes how our emotions need to be considered and kept in check, in our daily lives. Work and personal."
4,"good, but not great","This is the third Wahl trimmer that I have. This one does the job, but somehow this model does not seem as handy as the other two I have had. It may just be getting used to the attachments, but I don't like these as well."
3,Too loud,"I agree with other reviews who say this is too loud. It is nice that it runs on batteries so you don't have to mess with charging it, and does just an OK job trimming, but this noise is too much for me. Can't complain too much for the price I guess."
1,Product rusted quickly,"Unlike other clippers I've owned in the past, these started to rust with a week of use. Terrible! Would not recommend these"
2,Cheaply made and very loud,"I wanted something fairly small that can easily be packed in a suitcase for a trip. Unfortunately this is very cheaply made. The battery cover broke off the first time I used it. I had to wrap a piece of tape around it to keep it all together. It is also very loud, not a big deal, unless others are trying to sleep."
3,great music!,"I Love the music but both CD's have almost the same music on them, even the same song on one CD twice."
3,Jamaica vocal,I like it. Give me more relax when coming home from work. The sound is clear and nice. It OK to me.
3,Good,Makes me think of my Caribbean island vacations which brought back some good memories. Good one to have in your library.
4,Ya Mon!!!,We love this type of music. Play it often while sitting on the deck of our lake home. It kind of takes you away from reality to a much more festive place.
3,Bob Marley beginners set,"Album covers the more well know ""hits"". Thought there would be more variety. Many songs are repeated, some three times."
4,All the classics at a great price,I couldn't believe this cd was priced so reasonably. Now I have the classic album from the master whenever the reggae mood hits me.
3,Where's the bonus DVD?,"NO DVD! Product description clearly states ""Bonus DVD""Music is wonderful, but I ordered this specifically for the dvd!"
5,bob marley and the wailers legend deluxe edition,this a great cd espicially the second disc it has the remixes by eric thorngren. the first disc is as good as always but the second disc really makes this a great set that any true reggae fan should own. It is just as good as the other two disc sets exodus and catch a fire this cd ranks amoung my favorite cd's of bob marley and the wailers.
2,Duplicate Songs,"I am in love with bob marley music, but the reason i rated it so bad is because the same songs are on both disc, why is this so? Actually, there are eight duplicate songs, yes two of them are extened versions, but big deal.Thank you"
5,Legendary album,This album takes me back. This record has some great songs in the track list and great quality audio to bring this greatness to my ears in a almost crisp sound.
5,Expanded Legend,"Bob Marley's Legend compilation is among the biggest selling greatest hits albums of all time. The album cuts across all musical genres as rock fans, hip hop fans, r&b fans as well as reggae fans count it as part of their collection. The original set is augmented by a second disk of remixes and even if you are one of the multitudes who already own Legend, the second disk is worth the purchase as well as the remixing of the first disk which provides a superior sound to the original."
1,A Misleading Title,"I purchased this DVD with the assumption it would pertain to digital STILL photography, however it is specific to motion photography (videography). The product description ""Whether you want to shoot your own Blue and Green Screen to composite or just familiarize yourself with the terms and techniques"" also leads to an inaccurate depiction of this product. If you're looking for information on compositing still photography, this is not the resource for you.If you're looking at working with MOTION photography, this might be a decent and fairly cheap primer which also includes PDF's of lighting diagrams, a glossary, and a resources file, although, most (if not all) of this information could probably be found with an online search."
3,Cool ring,"This product was absolutely beautiful! It does wear out fast! In about a year's time, the silver coating wore off & was turning my daughter's finger green."
1,Saudi Arabia flag,"This item doesn't look like the pictures. I'm from Saudi Arabia and i know how is my country flag look like. The flag has written words and a sword on the bottom. Unlike what they send to me, they send me a flag with just words, no sword. I talked to them through e-mail but they didn't answer me. Too disappointed."
1,RIP-OFF,"CD contains two (2)-repeat two songs-for 34.99! I have no qualms about spending money to obtain great music but come on-this borders on larceny. Had Amazon included that information in their summary of the product, I would not have made the purchase as much as I love and enjoy the music of R. Crumb and the Cheap Suit Serenaders. Not worth the purchase!"
5,The letter as integral part of the life- work,"Kafka was one of the world's great letter- writers. His letters like his parables, his meditations, his fragments, his journals must be seen not as incidental and additional work but as an inherent part, a constituent center of his work. As a letter - writer Kafka has few equals. His metaphoric and poetic brilliance shine through time and time again. This collection may not have the focus of the letters written to a single person, as those to Milena and Felice Bauer but they also contain the line- by- line brilliance of mankind's greatest voice of anxiety and fear."
5,EL JESUS QUE NUNCA CONOCI,EXCELENT BOOK VERY UPLIFTING. i RECOMENDED TO THE SENIOR GROUP FROM MY CHURCHLO RECOMIENDO A TODA PERSONA DE HABLA ESPANOL. SE APRENDE MUCHO SOBRE LA VIDA DEL SENOR JESUS. SU TIEMPO Y ENSENANZA. QUE LO HACE PENSAR A UNO EN DETALLE PROFUNDO LO QUE DESCONOCIAMOS DE JESUS.
1,DISSAPOINTED,"I'M VERY DISSAPOINTED, I NEVER GOT MY BOOKS AND HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY ANSWER FROM THE SELLERS. MAYBE YOU GUYS CAN HELP ME. THANK YOU. yvsk04@yahoo.com Yvette Een"
5,El Jesús que nunca conocí,"Pienso que es un libro que toca los temas con los pies en el suelo. Me ha hecho reflexionar sobre algunos aspectos de cómo se desenvolvió Jesús entre sus contemporáneos. Me ayuda a acercarme al corazón de Dios, viendo sus actuaciones desde perspectivas diferentes."
4,As Funky as The cover,"Miles Davis&crew not only went into a World music vibe here but took on Sly,Jimi,&James all at once and anything else that was Funky at the time.this disc has alot of Groove.The Band is tight.worth a Listen that's for sure."
4,Excellent and a half,"This concert is a compainion to bothOn the Cornerand [[ASIN:B000002AH2 Dark Magus: Live At Carnegie Hall]If Coltrane did sheets of sound, Miles, around 1972, did sheets of rhythm. If you think of Kind Of Blue--how Miles stripped the music down to basic elements to allow for freer playing, this works the same way. Just in service of wha whas and tablas and not smooth trumpet and sax.This music just says ""go"" and never stops. If Kind of Blue is a stroll, this is a sprint.Get it."
5,Best Cheese Puffs,"I love cheese and things made with cheese, so I've had many cheese puffs. These have a little blue cheese added which gives them a sharper flavor than just cheddar. I've noticed a bit of inconsistency in the flavor from bag to bag. Sometimes there will be a great flavor with a good bite and sometimes a more mild flavor like normal cheese puffs. If you want to be assured of a milder flavor try the white cheddar. I don't like those - too mild. Be aware that the oil tends to settle in the puffs on the bottom half of the bag - so the puffs on top of the bag are lighter than the ones on the bottom. Personally, I think the bottom of the bag is a little better!"
2,Not very tasty,"The cheese puffs are okay, but I like a stronger cheesy taste. And I ordered a pack of 12 (hits head on desk). I have only tried the white cheddar cheese flavor. I don't know if any other flavors would taste better, but I would recommend trying a different product from a different brand."
5,First Editions: A Guide to Identification,I purchased this book for me and one for a friend. Once I spent time and learned how to use this reference it is the most comprehensive reference book on first editions. It is a wonderful addition to your collection in assisting you in identifying first edition books. I am glad I purchased this book.
3,Other than the photo's...,"Maybe it's just me, but this book didn't get me excited about many of its hikes. It has some good hikes, though they are not well described and some directions are not accurate. There are better hiking books out there..."
5,Classic,"Today this gentle work of fiction is as forgotten as a shadow.Robert Nathan chronicles the lives of homeless, jobless souls who have taken up residence in Central Park in the midst of the Great Depression.These are people "" whose fate was of interest to no one but themselves.Even the poets did not write about them,because the poets also were poor,and their nature made them indignant.They no longer wished to write poetry;on the contrary,they wished to fight;they threw themselves into the coal wars in the south,and were sent home with broken heads,like the heroes of antiquity"".This novel radiates charm; in 1935 it was produced as a feature film."
4,All you need is love,"A modern fable set in NYC during the darkest days of the Depression. A shopkeeper who has lost everything, a violinist, and a prostitute with a heart of gold end up living in a toolshed in Central Park. They scrape by, befriend an older couple, and save a ruined banker from suicide. Being a fable, Nathan is more interested in his ""moral"" than depicting reality, and the message here is a familiar one for Nathan: Love is all one needs to survive. The ending reflects this: the woman and shopkeeper go off to North Carolina to live off the land; it's a bit hard to swallow, but it's a pleasant thought, anyway."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"We purchased this book for our tour from Rome to Barcelona and found it absolutely useless. The route follows major highways while missing quiet backcountry roads. The author completely misses the true beauty of France and Italy in bypassing the Amalfi coast, Umbria, Tuscany and Provence. My advice... save your money for maps and a Lonely Planet guide. When every ounce counts, this is not a book you need to lug up a 1000 meter pass."
3,Good book for general planning.,Used the book as a guide for a cycle trip from Barcelona to Rome. Maps from local tourist offices were required for more detailed road and campground information.
3,Interesting but repetitive,"I enjoyed this book as I didn't really have a very good grasp of Germany's path to Nazism prior to reading but found much of it repetitive. In particular, a few basic statements were repeated several times, perhaps for emphasis. Overall, I'd say that if you want a concise journey thru Germany from the early '30s to 1945 this would be a very good book to read. It's certainly much more ""history"" vs. ""battle history"" which is what I had hoped.Those wanting more information to the lead-up years from the end of WWI to the 1930's should probably, however, look elsewhere. Of course, the brief informative overview is the intent of Modern Library Chronicles books so that is certainly not a fault. I just think the author could have used one more pass thru the book. For Modern Chronicles readers I'd rate it just above ""London"" and not quite up to ""Inventing Japan""."
4,Essential.,"Josh's final work is testament to the power of rock, soul and human spirit. Truly this album is a jewel. It is quite rare that we can share such precious gifts of purity and substance. Artist like this emerge a precious few a generation. If it weren't for his dear family most of us we may have missed him entirely. These songs roll like thunder and sustain like the most delicate kisses. If you liked ""floating on my back and staring at the gray,"" ""Let the dragon fly take you for a ride."" From ocean to sky, he knew the span of human experience. Soar. Highly recommended. Additionally recommended- Josh Clayton Felt Like Making a Live Record."
5,Wonderful and touching!,Great final CD from a great musician/writer. School of Fish rocked back in the day. I was surfing the web and came across his story and music. I am extremly impressed with this album. I would recommend to anyone who likes rock music.
5,Sheer Brilliance,"Anne Simon's ""The Real Science Behind the X-Files"" is my new favorite book. It addresses complex subject matter in a manner similar to that of Physicist Stephen Hawking...easy for the layman to understand and enjoy, and packed with enough hard core science for a true scientist to become captivated. And to top it all off, you've got Mulder and Scully as the leading characters. Simon does a magnificent job of illustrating exactly where the real science becomes science fiction, but gives due respect to that which is not yet proven or is knocking on the door of discovery. It makes you appreciate the ""X-Files"" a whole lot more knowing how much thought and effort goes into making the storylines as accurate as possible. Great for a casual read and a pleasantly entertaining learning experience."
2,Free SF Reader,"A fairly dull and didactic children's book, from memory. The author certainly didn't mind being unsubtle, in general, lambasting people of different races, religions, mindsets, nationalities, and even scientists.A chimney sweep kid ends up in the river, and gets some fantastic lessons along the way. Very avoidable."
2,"long on social politics, short on scholarship","Merlin Stone, a good writer, but not such a good scholar I'm afraid. If one wants to feel good about goddesses and about women, by all means read this book. If one wants information about goddesses in specific or citations to other scholarship, don't look to this book. Interpretations can be amusing when one has read the primary sources and knows about the cultures she looks at to a deep degree. Much better for the layperson or someone looking for positive female strokes than for a student or scholar."
3,Sad Wings of Destiny completely overlooked???,"I know the songs on this album were hand-picked by Judas Priest members themselves, but I am actually shocked that only one song from their 1976 album Sad Wings of Destiny (that song being Victim of Changes, amazing by the way) was included on here. That album is generally viewed as a top 3 of theirs (along with Stained Class and British Steel) and it is way underrepresented on this compilation. I think they could have made room for Dreamer Deceiver, Deceiver, and Tyrant on here. Or at least 2 of those...sigh, just one man's opinion."
4,Excellent introduction to the best metal band ever!,"""Living after Midnight"" (although I don't care much for the title track) is a fine compilation of Priest material, although one could certainly state that better songs could have been included. Despite this, excellent (and uncommon) choices are made, including Ram it Down, Some Heads Are Gonna Roll, and the live Tyrant. While tracks like Hot Rockin' and the title track are not the best in my books, the album itself is an excellent overview of the evolution of the band. Recommended to new listers, hardcore fans will likely already have all of this stuff.Key tracks - Heading out on the Highway, Ram it Down"
2,Good Music Poor Sound Quality,Great Music from a great band but the sound quality of the cd is bad. Might as well get out the 8 track.
2,The Best OF Judas Priest,"with a band like this, who needs the wanna be heavy metal bands today, like Creed, Stone Temple Pilots, etc. This album is a collection of some of their better songs, and should be owned by any Judas priest fan,or any MetalHead!"
2,Just make sure you know what you're buying.,"OK, I know I'm gonna get unhelpful votes but I feel that this needed to be said. Basically I bought this after buying Halford's ""Resurrection"" album. I'm also a massive fan of Iron Maiden, and I was under the impression that Judas Priest sounded a lot like Maiden. For those of you whose interest in this lies amongst liking Iron Maiden or similar bands, I think you should hear a few songs on MP3 first or something, because this offers a much lighter, slower, slimpler, feel-good rock sound in many places, rather than metal. It certainly sounds more 70s rather than 80s.I'm sure all you Priest fans will hate me for it but I felt that I had to say it so that somebody in my shoes didn't make the same uninformed mistake. If you like hard-rock/70's metal then this is great. But otherwise, stick with the more aggressive Iron Maiden."
3,"Not the best ""best of"" album","This is yet another subjective ""best of"" album created by a record company. To start with, the discography is missing their first two albums (""Rocka Rolla"" and ""Sad Wings of Destiny""). It's essentially their bigger hits. It's also missing some of their best songs. Songs like ""Cheater"", ""Never Satisfied"", ""The Ripper"", ""Deceiver"", ""Sinner"", ""Dissident Agressor"", ""Invader"", ""Beyond The Realms of Death"", ""Killing Machine"", ""Before The Dawn"" and many others are completely ignored. And that's just from the first five albums. I could go on, but I think you get the point. One would be better off getting ""The Essential Judas Priest"" or, better yet, the boxed set. I will say there are a lot of good songs on this, but it's far from all of ""the best"" of this great band."
3,Money men's choices,"I agree with the criticisms leveled at this compilation. To have live tracks on a Best Of is a crime, and raises the question ""why?"" Maybe someone decided the casual purchaser needed a few samples of Priest strutting their stuff in the live arena, but to me it makes the CD look like a cheap cop out. It's like saying the originals were weak when they most certainly weren't. How about giving people a decent package of a studio disc and a live disc? That would have made a good package. I also agree that the tracks on offer here are too radio freindly, and not a fair reflection of this great band's career."
2,not really a best of...,first of all. i happen to think that judas preist is a great band. (it is of course one of my favorite bands.) but i think that this compliation really does'nt do them much justice. i'm sure that for a couple of bucks more you can get metal works. or instead of testing the waters jump in buy an album like screaming for vengence. the songs sound a lot more impactful when heard in context. if your an entry level fan you can do much better than this...trust me i know this was the work of some record executive and not priest and thats what it should be seen as.
4,The Idea,"You should get the general idea of how Judas Priest's music sounded from this CD, with only Rocka Rolla and Stained Class being a no show album, and some Sad Wings and Sin tracks represented here in live form via Unleashed in the East. Every track is a highlight, IMO. Despite controversy from Priest, the genre defining music often gets overlooked."
5,Masterpiece,"Unforgettable masterpiece by Billie and Ray Ellis. Every aspect of Lady In Satin is perfect: the repertoire, the arrangements (by Ellis) and, of course, Billie's voice -well described in amazon's review. She had a tragic life and was not far from her death, yet Lady in Satin is a marvelous ode to love..."
5,One of the true masterpieces in Music!,"This is one of the greatest lp's Ever!, while Billie's voice was not at it's peak the emotional depths she reaches is what made this lp a classic! 'Lady in Satin' cannot be classified as a 'Jazz record' because it's not, this is a true Pop record with those incredible Ray Ellis arrangements, after listening to this lp many times I understood why so many artists say this was her best! and this lp has one of the most striking photos of Billie."
5,A masterpiece of all times!,"Billie Holiday, singing with what was left of her voice, happens to create with ""Lady in Satin"" a work of art that will enthrall listeners for ages, for her artistry here is just timeless.This is not music for playing in the house while you are doing other things, just as you would do with most singers nowdays...No, you have to take your time and be ready to enjoy every single note, phrase and all the emotion Billie distills in these songs. For it is her life she is singing here about, and only great artists can convey their experiences through art and make them worthwhile for others to listen to.All praises do not suffice for value this impeccable and emotional rendering. At the autumn of her career and life, when everyhing was telling her enough is enough, Billie Holiday challenges herself and creates, with all the passion and artistry she still proved to have, a jewel of musicianship that mankind will treasure forever: Lady in Satin."
2,an essential classic ?,"Having just read an article entitled the most essential jazz music of the past century I went and purchased ths Lady in Satin. This was an album that was professed to be one of the great ones. Powerfull and essential in Holiday's catalogue.I placed it into the CD palyer with great anticipation, first was the orchestration, big full and accurate. Then the horrific, screatching, off key shaky voice of the singer.I went onto the next track and more of the same. Fantastic big band orchestrations marred by this scared vioce. One track is an outtake and she speaks as if she was drunk ! I understand she had her hard times but at least the recording engineers could have taken the bottle out of her hands.This was a horrible let down."
5,Like no other!,This is probably the most unique and best of all the Billie Holiday albums you will ever hear. There is an obvious departure from her small band jazz recordings. All the songs are soft and mellow and are accompanied by a full orchestra with strings and even a vocal chorus. I wish she would have recorded more of this type of music with Herb Ellis. The selection of songs are what makes this a classic. Her moodfull singing of songs about hearbreak and love accompanied by Herb Ellis' orchestra will make this a must have for any Holiday fan who hasn't heard this album already.
2,A collection for posers,"I love Billie Holiday when she is backed by Jazz music, especially the saxophonist Lester Young. She was a Jazz singer afterall. This CD has her fronting a very cheezy, langorous, muzak-like string arrangement. Much of her youthful insouciance is gone in these recordings, made during her last years of life. The music painfully plods through just about every hit song Billie sang, each one introduced with a flurry of terrible sounding strings. There's hardly any alteration in her tone and, if you're not listening very closely, you might think the CD was covering an extended version of the same melody. There are Billie Holiday collections much better than this one, such as 'Love Songs' or the two cd set of Billie Holiday with Lester Young entitled 'A Fine Romance'. It is in these recordings that the true beauty and charm of Billie's voice comes through."
2,Something wrong later part of CD,"It took a few weeks, it was little longer to arrive me.And CD was just CD only, no jackets and something wrong later part of CD."
4,Fun on Flat Surfaces,"Purchased this for our 3-year old son's birthday. He test rode one in a toy store and had a blast. I thought our driveway was flat - until we started riding the PlasmaCar on it (yes, me and my husband joined in the fun). Apparently, our driveway has the slightest of inclines - which makes it hard to zip around on this car. It is doable, but not enjoyable. Our son mostly pushes the PlasmaCar up to the ""top"" of the driveway and rides back down. It also works really well in the garage. Fun, but I sort of wish I had explored getting him the Flying Turtle instead."
5,fun and durable,"I have a home daycare and teens and all have used this toy. Have had it for 2 years and it still gets used vitually everyday. Great way to burn energy on a rainy day. Fun and easy to use. Durable- I have used it, teens have used it, and ages 2 - 7 use it almost everyday. I only allow it to be used on the smooth garage floor. Works best there and keeps tires from wearing down."
1,missing part makes it useless - twice!,Three times I purchased the plasma car for my kids and twice it's missing a part. A simple bolt is missing and can not assemble the car. It can be a great product but without all the parts it's USELESS!!
3,Not good for use on tiled floors,"We bought this toy because a cousin had it at his house and my boys really enjoyed it while we were in town visiting. The problem is that it worked great on his wood floors but when we bought it and tried to use it at our house where we have 12"" X 12"" tiled floors it absolutely did not work as well as it did at his house. We try and try but can never really get it going for it to be any fun:("
1,Not a PlasmaCar! This is a Swivel Car.,"Buyer beware! I received this item, thinking I was getting what the product headline described, and I was disappointed to find out that I was deceived. This is false advertising. The assembly instructions for this product describe it as a Swivel Car, and it is not the quality of a Plasma Car."
5,The Best,"We have had this toy since my girls where two and one. At that age, they loved it and at five and four, they still do. They STILL play with it almost every day, along with every single kid who comes to our house. It is so easy to drive and really fun to cruise around ON HARDWOOD FLOORS. This toy IS NOT MADE FOR OUTSIDE USE, we tried. If you have hardwood, you cannot go wrong. I've tried to hide it away in the basement several times but it always comes right back up."
5,Plasma car,"I think this will be one of those 'classic' fun toys for the whole family. A 2 yr old can ride it with ease as a 'kick' vehicle because there is nothing to get in the way of their feet. A 5 yr old has a great time as well as a 35 yr old! Also, it is very smooth riding on concrete or a smoother surface but not quite as easy on bumpy asphalt. I would recommend this product and would even consider buying another so my kids could 'race' - so far my kids have had a great time with it."
5,Very EASY to ASSEMBLE!,"I was too excited to receive the 2 cars I ordered from Amazon - and Amazon delivers on whatever date is specified - on time!I assembled it myself, pretty easy - I would be surprised if you cannot assemble the entire thing in less than 5minutes! Well, a little confusing on the bolt part...I thought I did something wrong as the black butterfly steering wheel cannot propel the front wheels. BUT, I figured I just had to tighten up those screws..and Voila! Ready to go! My kids' ages are 7 and 3 - THEY SO LOOOOOVE THEM!! I got one for each. ("",)"
2,Plasma car,"I got this for my 3 yr old grandson for is birthday. The video makes it look so easy. My grandson had a hard time pedaling his tricycle, so i thought this would be perfect. But since he can't get it to go on its own, he just uses his feet to push himself like he does on his tricycle. My son in law who only weighs 150 couldn't get it to work very well either, couldn't get it to tip correctly to use the front wheel."
4,The best od the best,I must tell you that my grandson has a disability and this toy let him feel like he was just as good as everyone else. He has motor skill issues. His disability was not present after a few minutes of instructions. I want to say thank you very much.
4,Fun car,"My kids got these when they turned four. They love zooming around, I love the upper body exercise they're getting."
3,Not for carpet. At all.,"This is a neat little outside riding toy which my 5 year-old grandson loves. It works well on the asphalt cul-de-sac where we live, but in the basement, it's pretty useless.We have a tight-weaved berber carpet in our finished basement, which I thought would be just fine. It is not deep-pile at all, but the PlasmaCar will not budge on it.Oh, yeah, it works fine on the hardwood floor upstairs, but the directions warn of scuffing and scratching on hardwood.So -- great outside toy. And great indoors on tile or ceramic floors. That's it."
5,Please do not mislead me...,"We ordered the plasma car for the little ones that come to visit us. That has worked great...they love the cars!!! Even fight over them!!!But the instructions state ""no assembly needed"". Do not do that...you are misleading because there is assembly required. And it is time consuming. So my suggestion is you continue to promote your fine product but please tell the truth!!"
1,Wrong car sent,"Was NOT a PasmaCar, but a swirl or something like that. It looked like a Plasma, but that's all. Don't know how they can advertise that it was."
1,PlasmaCar,"This is the first product review I've ever done. I was so disappointed with the plasmacar I felt compelled to write this. I bought 2 of these for my twin boys (4 years old) for Christmas, I was looking at the turtle flyer and bought the plasmacars based on the great reviews I saw. We were not impressed with these things. The wheels and steering wheel were very difficult to get on correctly, the wheel on one has fallen off numerous times. My boys are very active and this toy is just too slow moving for them. We were very disappointed and feel like we wasted $130 on two of these. I wish I could return them..."
5,Better than the old wiggle wagon,My grandkids have a chance to experience what their parents experienced in the older version called a wiggle wagon.
5,incredible,"My son (3 years old) first saw this in the toy store a few days before Christmas and from the moment he sat on it he was obsessed. He did not get off of it until I made him, about 30 minutes later, because he kept running into people in the store. There's something about this ""car"" that he loves and when he saw that Santa brought it for him on Xmas, it was all over. He gets such a kick out of how he doesn't have to really pedal, just steer, and it moves. It is not meant for carpet, only smooth surfaces. He ""glides"" all over the place in my house, it was definately worth the $50 I paid on amazon. It was by far his favorite Xmas gift this year."
4,What every 3 year old would like!,"Our 3 year old grandson, Sam, immediately jumped on the car and went off with a big smile. His older siblings also tried it out and had as much fun. The red sporty appearance adds to the interest and fun of moving on wheels. It looks sturdy and hopefully will hold up for some time. A successful toy for a very active grandson."
4,Fun But Need Right Tools and Flat Surface to Ride,"I bought this for my seven year old daughter after she had a blast trying this out at the toy store. I didn't have a retractable screwdriver or a mallet. I could not assemble it until I borrowed these tools. The directions said it came with a tool but I couldn't find any in the box.We have a basement area which is relatively flat but I know my daughter will enjoy this more when Spring hits and we find a nice flat parking lot which has more space to ride. Inclines, tiles and bumps are an issue as far as mobility.Otherwise the hassles, this is a fun toy which adults can enjoy as well as kids. My wife seems to enjoy it more as she is 5'4'' and I'm 5'10'' and it seems a bit small for me to use. (works though for me)"
3,Plasma car,Our grandchildren loved it but it was kind of difficult for them ages 3&8 to get the hand of maneuvering it. It took a while
5,Great Gift for kids!!,This is one of the best things I ever received for my 3 year old son. We've had it for a few months now and he still has a blast riding all around the house in this Plasma Car. It is easy to steer indoors and outdoors and he spends many hours on it! I even had a ride myself :)I would recommend this Plasma Car for all kids ages 3-6! You cant go wrong with giving it as a gift!!
1,poor quality,"Thinking this car looked very fun, I bought 2, one for my niece and one for my own son. Both of them had parts that broke within hours of their first use. Very, very disappointed in the quality of construction of these for the price that you pay. While they were fun while they lasted, they are not worth the investment!"
5,Fun,This plasma car has gone through my three grand kids and the next three can't wait to ride it. It is a welcome change from heavy battery powered toys.
5,best toy,my kid very love this car every day he must play two three time i buy many toy this is the best!
4,All four of my kids love this thing,"My kids range in age from 2 through 13. When we first opened this up, I thought because of the size it'd only be fun for my four year old. I was wrong! My 13 year old daughter fits on this as well. A great buy!!"
4,Great on the right surface,Like others have said the PlasmaCar is great on the right surface. Luckily our driveway is smooth enough for proper operation. I can see how the car would get bogged down on a rough surface. When we move our cars out of the garage the PlasmaCar is amazing on smooth concert of the garage floor. I've read other reviews about people using the PlasmaCar indoors. I'm sure it would work well on our hardwood floors but we're not comfortable with the car zipping around inside.Overall the car is a lot of fun (even adults under 220 pounds can ride it). If you have a flat smooth open area this toy is perfect for your kids.
5,Plasma cars are the best ride on toy ever,You can not go wrong withva genuine plasma car. They are hours of fun fir kids. And when the kids go to bed. They are fun for adults too! Can hold an adults weight.
4,"Fun, fun, fun...",My duaghter really like this toy. She always gets on it when we have friends and family over. Only works really well on an incline so she rides it down the driveway. I would definitly recommend this toy.
4,Exercise Fun,"We bought this for our grandson for his 3rd birthday. His older brother has one, (we bought for him in March) and the 3 year old has been bugging his brother to ride this car. To be honest, we've never seen this car in action. Our daughter says the neighborhood kids have them and they all love it, our grandson's included. It's great exercise."
5,Great Toy but sells for less in Costco,"We purchased this toy for our kids, ages 6 & 7. The toy is well built and is wonderful. Amazon, however, has priced it way too high. After ordering this toy from Amazon (whom we trusted for reasonable prices) we were crestfallen to discover it in our neighborhood Costco for $37/- compared to Amazon's price of $48/-."
5,Great toy for any age,I read all of the positive reviews of the Plasma Car and wondered if it would live up to its name and it has. My children continue to play with it a lot and I love the fact that it's not powered by batteries. I also like that it relies on the child's own energy and imagination. I would HIGHLY recommend this toy. I gave it three stars for educational value simply because it's obviously not a toy that involves studying or direct learning.
1,"This is poor imitation, not the real PlasmaCar","I ordered original PlasmaCar by PlasmaCar, not an imitation poorly made imitation. The package was so poor, the product doesn't even look sturdy. I'm trying to contact the seller, and return the product. I don't undertand why amazon doesn't review the product before they let the 3rd party sell their product. They shouldn't make it look like they are selling the original product that buyer's trying to buy, they make it look like the original, and made me buy because it was on trusted Amazon site, and what I got is a piece of crap."
1,An imitation!!! Not a real PLASMACAR!!,"I bought this product for my nephew, and when it arrived it was in a multicolored, unlabeled, cheap box, with generic assembly directions and a cheap plastic plasmacar imitation! The product was essentially unlabeled except for a ""made in China"" sticker on the bottom. This is so misleading! The real Plasmacar should have a yellow sticker under the steering wheel (nicely demonstrated by another reviewer here in a you tube video), a name brand box, and is made in Canada by a company called ""PlaSmart."". Sadly, I learned all of this AFTER receiving this cheap imitation and researching it better. Sending mine back today! What a disappointment. This is my first review of a product, and it was unfortunately inspired by feelings of bing ""duped!"". Buyer beware!"
5,Excellent - Tuist N'Ride,"PlasmaCar Red (Purchased on August 1, 2012)by PlasmaCarThis is a great unit. Our grandchildren love it and not only them but we the adults have riden on it as we are within the weight range.Lots of fun and holds up well."
3,Plasma car,"this product doesn't work as anticipated. I think if you were in a gymnasim like the video showed it would be easier but just to ride outside, it is very difficult. Too expensive for what this item will do. The kids still like it but they have to use their feet unless they are headed downhill. Will not purchase additional cars and was considering two more if they worked for my two other grandchildren. At this point they will just have to share."
5,Plasma Car,"I purchased three of these little cars. My children have had much fun with them each warm day. However, warm days have been very few here lately. But, when spring gets here, the cars will get a lot of use."
2,Product Needs Improvement...,"This ""could"" have been a great riding toy but after assembly, the handle-bar won't stay on. We've tried everything. The instructions even state ""if the handle-bar won't stay on..."" They should ship it assembled!"
2,No is a plasma car is an imitation. I don't like it.,look cheap and not is a plasma car is an imitation. not is the items that describe. Next time dont said that is a plasma car.
2,"ok, but not worth the price paid.","I bought this for my kids and have been disappointed in how much they actually enjoy it. Granted my 2 year old is still a little small for it. But even my 5 year old doesn't seem to get much out of it. When I originally looked at this product a year ago, it was maybe $30.00 or a little over. The fact that I paid $54.00 for this product is disappointing. I see no justification in such a jump in price, but thought I would buy it after reading some of the reviews. If I had it to do over again, I would not have bought this product."
2,Cheaper at Costco,I just bought this plasma car on Amazon and it's awesome. Problem is I found it at Costco 2 days later for $38. Should have just got it there - oh well.
3,Red Plasma Car,"My 11 year old son ripped this car out of the box and read the instructions and proceeded to put it together. In the process of putting it together he hammered the bolt into the steering column and damaged the bearing. I was able to order a new one and once it came in the mail, we got it put together. My point... read the instructions carefully and make sure an adult is supervising. Now the car is a great play toy and he enjoys it thoroughly."
1,Used Item,The plasma car appeared to be used. I could not return it since I was giving it to my grand daughter for her forth birthday. I cleaned it up after I put it together but the foot pads were still a little dirty and would not stay down tight to the frame. Overall I think the product was not up to my standards and what I am use to when buying items from Amazon.
4,fun but limited,"This toy is fun but limited - the ground has to be extremely flat. My 2 year old son doesn't get the concept of it...but I think he will next year or so. He still rides on, but scoots himself along by using his feet. I can give him a ride on it without exceeding the weight limit and I must say, it's pretty fun! It doesn't go too fast, but fast enough for a child."
5,mother of 4,"The PlasmaCar is terrific! My three oldest children each have one, ages 9,6 and 3. They all have alot of fun driving them together. It is made extremely well and very easy to use. It needs to be used on a smooth, hard surface. I even take a turn on it once and a while. Great invention and well worth the value."
4,Kid-friendly if you have the space!,"I bought this toy for a 3 year old birthday boy, and he loves it. Now he can roll and scoot with his brothers, 7 and 10, who have all the scoot along toys you could imagine (ripstick, pogo bouncers, razor scooters, powerwings, etc). He feels he can join in the fun. They are really easy to use and maneuver. They just wiggle the steering wheel and they are moving. They work best on open areas. I thought about buying one for my kids, but limited space and carpet kept us from that purchase."
3,it broke,"this was really fun for my small children, indoors and out, until it broke. some little plastic washer in the steering mechanism broke and now it cant steer at all. im now trying to find replacement parts."
3,knockoff,"i ordered this for my grandson for Christmas and was very disappointed to receive a cheaper looking knockoff with a different name, which escapes me at the moment. On the other hand, it was very easy to assemble and works as the PlasmaCar is advertised. 2 yr old can operate it by turning the handle on smooth surfaces, but also likes pushing it with his feet on more uneven terrain. Just hope it holds up as the reviews of PlasmaCar indicated that brand does."
4,Good riding toy!,"We were looking for pedal riding toy for our child. However what we found were all too small for her, motorized and very expencive. One of our cousin had those and we knew she liked so we ordered. It was good riding toy, and now she cruising around the house. If you turn the handle 180 degree, you can go backward. That was very neat than idea of turning around somewhere to go back!"
5,My kids love it!,"When we took it out of the box, I thought it would be too young for my kids (9,7, & 6) but once we put it together (all you need is a hammer and a screwdriver or rachet), it turned out to be great fun for the whole family.It's very easy to put together. You just pop on the back wheels and line up the front wheels and steering wheel and tighten, then you're good to go. It says not to use on hardwood floors, but as it was dark out and we really wanted to try it out, we used it on hardwood. The wheels do slip on the wood, but it didn't scratch our floor.My kids used it the first night for about 1.5 hours before bedtime. Mom and Dad even took a turn on it. It's fun and totally powered by you, so it's pretty good exercise too. The 6 year old wants to ride it to school, which we might allow, at least until the snow starts.We may have to buy another one so that the kids can race! It will be loads of fun in the spring and summer!"
1,Couldn't get past the smell,I couldn't use more than one spray because the fragrance of this product is extremely potent and makes you smell like a big chunk of bubble gum - I had to wash it off immediately.
1,works sort of for a day,"While it goes on evenly with minimal effort, the hardly noticeable tanning only lasts until you shower. not really sure what the point is in buying a spray tanner that requires you to lay in the sun to see any change. You might as well buy some aerosol water, you'd get the same effect."
4,"Interesting and helpful, but AWFUL sound quality!","I really enjoyed the first half of this video, learning the basics of Chinese brush painting (haven't really gotten into the second half yet, I'm still practicing!). However, the sound quality is horrible! I had to turn my television volume up to nearly 3/4 which I have never had to do. The information on materials & supplies, and the explanation of her brush strokes as she worked was very helpful, and I enjoyed the laid-back approach. Overall a good video, aside from the sound issue."
2,Brush Painter,"Jane Evan's DVD on An Introduction to Chinese Brush Painting does not do justice to her skills as a teacher. The movie is amateurishly produced and the limited angles prevent viewing the way she loads her brush. It is not organized step by step as she moves from one topic to the next, she mumbles into her work, instead of speaking up into the camera and the strokes are too quickly executed without adequate explanation. More explanations on how to move the brush, the direction of the strokes and how to load the ink or color on the brush are required.This is not a movie for beginners.The Dancing Brush"
1,Chinese brush painting,"This video shows how Ms. Evans can paint vs. showing the viewer how. Its not good for step by step instruction. I am an art teacher and Id never show this video to my students, They would never get it. If you are experienced , you might get something out of it. Ms. Evans has a strong (English?) accent that isnt easy to follow. I thought it was very boring. Find a someone that knows how to show you. Not good for classroom use."
2,Selling damaged DVD,"The overall DVD is very informative however the chapter on bamboo painting ( why I bought the DVD) which the narrator says is the most important part of Chinese brush painting is a dark spot with the text ""Damaged Tape"" and they skip the whole chapter. Don't sell damaged goods or fix it or give a warning that it is not a complete DVD."
4,Worth reading,"Obviously written by a professional. Not necessarily thrilling, but a worthwhile look into the history of military deception. Seperation by chapters of deception through the various mediums and modes of warfare is useful. Nevertheless, the chapter on deception in revolutionary and counterrevolutionary warfare (insurgency) is weak in comparison with the book's treatment of conventional/regular war."
1,Not Recommended.,"I really wish I hadn't ordered these. In the picture it looked the the top of the stopper was smooth, but it isn't - it has sharp ridges. When I reach in to unplug it the edges of it are so sharp it hurts my fingers, so instead I have to use a knife to remove it, which is annoying. I tossed both of the ones I bought after only one week of use - I just couldn't stand them and the price to ship them back would have been almost as much as I paid for them. If you don't mind the sharpness then you might like them. I had no other problems with them. Truly though, I think it is cheaper to just buy ones at the grocery store and save the shipping costs."
3,"Interesting concept, but where's the story?","Nick Bantock has come up with a very innovative idea -- make a commemorative souvenir for the anniversary of a nation that has chosen not to exist. I have to admit, I really like the concept, but I was hoping for more of a story than a little 40-page booklet (which, in reality, is not much more than a pamphlet) explaining the heritage of these people. There's such a rich story waiting to come out, and all Bantock does is scratch the surface. I would have loved to find out more, but there's nothing else but stamps and postcards from which I could glean information. I've got almost all of Bantock's other material, and I have to say that, while it's probably one of the most visually satisfying works, it's one of the least satisfying as far as storyline goes. It's a good addition for an avid Bantock collector, but if you're looking to begin a love affair with his work, start with The Venetian's Wife or the Griffin and Sabine Trilogy."
5,wonderful artbox,this is a wonderful artbox. the postcards and the stampsheet make it even more beautiful. love the story as well.i am planning to give this as a xmas gift to my friends.
3,Do you prefer story or art?,"This artbox is rather hard to rate. The box is beautifully presented; 15 postcards and a small sheet with two stamps are gently tied on the inside. Facing them is a little booklet in a slip-case. The art and presentation deserves a five-star rating. As usual, Bantock's collage work is amazing. However, the story is underdeveloped and much too short. To say that it is a 48 page book is highly misleading. It has about the same amount of text as a travel brochure, and I would give it one star. But if you enjoy Bantock, why not go for it?"
2,mycra pac disappointment,"Ordered this to replace my old one, bought several years ago and recently stolen. The older style was very romantic and almost ankle length with a very large hood, worthy of the opera or a formal evening out. By comparison to the older style, the new style is extremely disappointing, much shorter, much skimpier, hood is ugly and the coat is simply no longer special or elegant with the style change. If I could contact the maker I would urge them to bring the old style back. I hear the style change only recently occurred in fall 2012, so all the wonderful reviews are for the older style. I sent mine back. The newer one not lovely. Bring the old style back!"
1,I have yet to receive the product,I have not yet received the product...I did get notified awhile ago that it was delayed.
2,A singer that deserves more attention,"I first came across Bessie Griffin's awesome voice on an LP compilation many years ago and have been searching for more from this singer ever since. Hearing her rendition of the song ""Too close"" is something one will never forget! On this cd, however, most of the songs are uptempo, fast style and the background provided by the musicians is too much alike from one song to another. Still this is a very lively cd and well worth having since there's not too much to be found by this unique singer."
4,Miscasting Still Doesn't Ruin the Film,"Sigourney Weaver is the LAST actress I would have chosen for this film. Too many sound,wonderful British actresses to pick from -- why Weaver? The rest of the cast is essentially perfect. However, I rarely read anything about a feature of the film that still has me tinkering on my piano all these years later--that music! dada da dada da dum dee dum....da da dum dee dum dee dum dee dum....over and over again, the steely instruments of indigenous chorals floods my body. Did this movie earn a nomination for Best Original Score? The environment of music (I am a pianist) can make or break a good story into a great story."
4,Year of living dangerously,This was a earlier Gibson movie his newer ones were done better a a a a a a a a
1,Edited for TV,"I loved the original theatrical release of The Year of Living Dangerously. I watched it over and over. It was a beautiful, sensuous film. This is not the original. This DVD was the work of some hack who left the best parts of the movie on the cutting room floor. Gone is much of the gamelan music, many scenic shots of Indonesian countryside, and one of the hotest make-out scenes in cinematic history. Just as Mel Gibson and Sigourney Weaver are about to go at it the scene abruptly ends. Even the sequence of the original is changed. The over all effect is a coursening of what had been a classic. This was such a dark and murky print I still wonder if I somehow got a bootleg copy surreptitiously videotaped by some artless thug. I feel angry and cheated.I recommend waiting until the original version is released. DON'T BUY THIS TRASH!"
1,The Year of Living Dangerously,One the worst documentary shows.It does not highlight much what was going on in the country during such a serious event that had taken place. A very poor production and lack of any real serious investgation.
3,Good but not great,"I have watched a lot of dramatic movies, but this one just didn't grip me. One of the things that I found awkward was the 1980's score -it was just too imposing. Also, the visual quality was not that great on the DVD. However, it's still a fair insight into what was going on in Indonesia in 1965."
4,Filipino actors gave viable support,"This may be a Gibson, Hunt and Weaver movie. But Filipino actor Bembol Roco gives amiable support. And Kuh Ledesma, who is considered to be the Philippines' Barbra Streisand, makes appearance as an Indonesian maiden assisting Gibson's reporting character. I just wish she sang the theme song for the film if there was one."
5,Smoldering,"They just don't make these kinds of films anymore that blend romance,action,intrigue, political machinations, and manage to keep it modern and original. Set against the backdrop of Suharto's regime, Mel Gibson plays an investigative Australian reporter hunting stories against martial law uprising. Just 26 years old when he played the leading man, Mel Gibson and Sigourney Weaver shine. It's a classic!"
5,Impressed,"I was worried, but it turned out to be a great movie. Arguably one of Mel Gibson's better performances."
2,BORING!!!!!!!!!,"Okay, what IS with all these dogs dieing? And if the mother is supposedly indian then WHY does she have blond hair? The dogs are cute,and the second movie is a slight improvement but other then that..."
2,Disappointing,"As an animal lover and a fan of such great tear jerker films such as The Yearling, Black Beauty and Old Yeller, I was sadly disappointed in this film. I found the actors were not that charismatic. Their clothing, hairstyles, and the sets appeared to be very 1970's(supposed to be depression era),and damn if that wasn't my 1964 Schwinn bike one of the kids in town was riding! When I finally turned it off, the kid was cutting down a beautiful old tree just so he could kill the 'coon that was hiding in it. Sorry, guys, but even the voice of Andy Williams singing original songs by the Osmonds couldn't do much for this cheesy redneck flick! Two stars for the cute puppies."
4,Where The Red Fern Grows,Even tho this was the older version of the movie it was good and my 11 & 7 yr old grandsons liked it very much. Made me cry.
4,"I promised I would not cry, but I did!","I had never heard of the movie before until my boyfriend brought it home one night for us to watch. He told me I would cry and I promised him I would not. Watching the passion the boy had for these two dogs was amazing and by the end of the movie I was attached to the boy and his dogs and I cried to say the least! For a while after that everytime my boyfriend would just meantion ""Where the Red Fern Grows"", I would cry. That was in 1991 and we have been married over 6 years now and I have never forgotten that movie. I think it is a classic and all who are tenderhearted should view it. Have lots of tissues on hand when you do."
4,A Gripping movie,"Set in the thirty's, Red Fern centers around a boy named Billy who after two years, saves up money to buy coon hounds and names them Old Dan and Little Ann. A great movie{featuring music by Andy Williams} for young children. The book is espicially good. Unfortuantely, the sequel is a poor rancid excuse for a movie. Check it out!!! The ending will touch your heart!!!!!"
3,Not as I remembered,"It was about 25 years ago when I first watched this movie. I had a Red-Bone Hound dog at the time which is what these dogs are. This movie made me cry at the time but now watching it so many years later, it has lost that emotion for me and seems very dated in the acting and scenery."
5,Where the red fern grows,"I saw Where the Red Fern Grows when I was eight and it was quickly my favorite movie.The plot is Billy Coleman wants coon hounds very badly. His family is poor so he is not able to get them from his parents. So he saves his own money. Then he buys his hounds. The only reason he has the hounds is because of an add in a sportsman's magazine. Billy hunts with his coon hounds. His coon hounds are the two best coon hounds in the Ozarks. It tells about the up's and down's in his life with his dogs.This film was great in the overall story of friendship.The movie didn't have much special effects. The movie was AWESOME how it is.This movie teaches you about love, friendship, and courage through a twelve year old boy's life. Billy never wants to let go of his dogs because he loves them. Billy and his dogs battled through the cold Ozark Mountains too."
3,Where the Red Fern Grows,"this movie is very near and dear to my heart. It was a movie that my (then) 9 year old son were watching on a Saturday morning when it was snowing outside and he had to be inside. The movie made me cry and when I looked over at my son, he had tears in his eyes. First time I ever saw him cry when watching a movie! I purchased this DVD for him as a stocking stuffer when he was about 25 years old and we watched it again Christmas morning. Again, but much less, I saw tears in his eyes. The quality of the movie could have been much better I feel. There are several editions of this movie so be carefuly when choosing the title. The quality of the DVD itself had poor sound and old timey type picture quality. It could have been better but that wasn't why I purchased the movie in the first place, so quality wasn't what drove my decision for purchase."
2,A disappointment,The Depression-era story of the devotion of a young boy for his loyal hunting dogs. This production suffers from its low budget and stiff performances. It fails to capture the essence that made the Wilson Rawls novel so appealing.
1,Where the Red Fern Grows,"I'm 12 years old and in the 7th grade. In my composition class, I was required to read this book and I loved it. But when I watched the movie it stunk. I hated the movie compared to the book. The movie skipped where Little Ann wins the beauty contest. The book has so much detail when I closed my eyes I could see myself there. I think the director should make another movie as similar to the book as he can get it."
3,Red Fern,The book was awesome. I read it two years ago in 5th grad. Then my teacher had us watch the movie. It was ok. The book was way better. The movie was ok though. Not very good at all. It's worth watching if you wanted to escape 2 hours of class!
1,The Worst Movie Ever,"Wow! They can turn one of the best books ever into the worst movie I think I've ever seen. I read the book in my Language class. I thought that the book was alright for something that we had to read. But then when we watched the movie, it changed my whole perspective on Where The Red Fern Grows. The actors were horrible, the same with the special effects. And if you get this movie to watch what you read, you need to find something else. It leaves out some of the best parts of the book. I was disgusted with this movie. It may be the worst movie I've ever seen."
1,Good Movie about friendship,I bought this for my granddaughter who had read the book with her class at school. She wanted the movie to share with the class. She likes to read books and then see the movie if available. It seems to help in seeing the characters and the story line. All of the family has viewed this movie and we all love to watch it every chance we get. I highly recommend this movie for all families.
1,the movie had no ending it just stopped in the middle!,I was very unhappy with this DVD the thing just stopped a little more than half way through I will never use or refer anyone to this company!
5,Great Family Movie,"""Where the Red Fern Grows"" is as good as I remember from my youth. Great for the whole family, it brings out a range of emotions."
3,A Sad Tale,"I was very disappointed in the so called ""epic"" Where the Red Fern Grows. I expected to see some of the finest, bloodiest, and coolest films in history. Instead I saw some of the most G fight scenes ever. I mean, why even put them in if you're just going to see a film scene that looks like a blur? Also, Rubin's death scene seemed very purposeful, as if he was committing suicide.I was extremely disappointed at the way they cut out VERY important scenes of the movie. For example, the beauty contest scene was completely cut out, something which should NEVER have happened. What I'm trying to say is: This movie was very tragic, but at the same time seemed to have no emotion."
5,So good I wish I could give it 10 stars ! - by Damaris,"Now after all the movies I saw I have to say that Where the Red Fern Grows was the BEST one.I have never seen anything like it before.I thought the movie was very strong.The movie had a lot of emotional parts in it.I thought the boy who played Billy was the kind of boy who always agreed with his dogs and who never gave up on them. Now I've been reading other people's review of the movie, and most of them wrote that the movie was bad because it was not the same as the book.Well, I thought they were wrong. There might be someone who didn't like the book, so they'd want to see the movie and if it was exactly the same as the book, they want to see the movie! I am Happy the way the movie is.The people who made the movie did a great job."
3,Where the Red Fern Grows Movie Review,"The movie was okay and there are parts I like and don't like. Before you watch the movie, I recommend that you read the book first because the book has more detail and the movie cut out a scene or two, but it's still pretty good. Even though I personally like movies better than books, I have to say the book was a bit better than the movie.The movie is great and it has great actors and is a lot like the book, but it's missing some parts. For example, they totally cut the scene where Little Ann falls into the river when they are hunting and when he was getting the dogs, he rode a pipe just like the school kids. They also left out some major parts such as, the dogs don't seem as close to each other and took out a little of Billy's character because he doesn't seem as close to the dogs as he is in the book.The movie doesn't show all the details, but, hey you can't expect it to have everything in it, can you?By: Sara Jan"
1,This was just like the one I saw on TV and it was very good. Everyone liked it.,This was sad in several places but taught a good lesson for a youth. I thought it was excellent. I ordered the #2 one but as of yet we haven't reviewed it. Hope it is as good as the first one.
3,The Protagonist?,"I share the name of this book's protagonist; and that's primarily why I bought the book (out of curiosity). People are always telling me I have a ""cowboy name"", and I guess Mr. Friend's use of it (my name) underscores that feeling. I have also been told I look like I am, or should be, a cowboy on more occasions than I can recount. THEREFORE, if this book is ever made into a movie, wouldn't it be only fitting that I play the lead role (Clay Shannon as Clay Shannon)?"
5,Wonderfull Lutherian Hymns,A nice hymn album by Mahalia Jackson in clear sound eventhough the musical arrangements could be made much better. If you have the old Lp you better exchange it with this cd.I regret that there are no bonus tracks included.
4,Short Suns,"All I can say, on the whole, about Gene Wolfe's ""The Book of the Short Sun"" trilogy, especially ""Return to the Whorl"", is sensational. A gentle, ambitious, and exquisite expedition into the strange and richly exotic. Complex and simplistic intriguing in its delivery. ""Return to the Whorl"" leaves the reader in breathless awe, as only Wolfe can do it, and masterfully and impressively as Wolfe so often does."
3,"Page Turner, Not a Bodice Ripper","I enjoyed reading the first few hundred pages of Slammerkin. The young girl, rejected by her mother, saved by the hooker with a heart of gold. I enjoyed the dirty filth of 18th century London from the point of view of a young prostitute who has a taste for the finer things in life. (Who doesn't, right?)I don't need a happy ending to every book I read but what is the point about reading about a girl whose life sucks, and then sucks more, because of poor choices. It could be a morality tale written by a nun, but it's not; Donoghue is a PhD, I thought she might have a few more tidbits of significance in her narrative. A glimmer of redemption? Nope.While I appreciate the dark and morbid imagination of Ms. Donoghue, fueled by facts and history, I still felt cheated after reading the entire book. The shift in POV of the narrator toward the end of the book seems like a desperate turn of the rudder to right the list of the book, but it only confuses things."
3,"engaging and descriptive, but...","if my mistress/owner took the money i ""worked"" so hard for and gave it to the poor box, among other condescending things she's done to me, you bet i'd kill her."
1,Struggles and struggles and struggles and ...,"I heard a review on the radio and thought the concept was interesting. Then, I was on jury duty with this as my only book. I read it all. You don't need to."
4,Great period fiction,"Perfectly balanced and expertly paced, this is one of the finest novels I've read in a long time. Mary Saunders is a character that the reader cannot help but love. Donoghue has created a cast of characters with great care, richly complex and full of emotion. She balances the novel so well, with a multitude of comparisons and contrasts. Consider the dichotomy between the seedy, gritty life of London and the simple, traditional life of the Welsh countryside. Consider the numerous characters that serve as foils to Mary, serving to enhance the readers understanding of her character. There's not a single character missing, nor a single character that's superfluous. And Donoghue knows just when to slow down the narrative, pausing to let the reader absorb the period with all five senses, and she knows just when to speed it up, spicing it with drama, suspense, and unabashed ribaldry. Great writing."
4,Great read but very depressing,"Slammerkin really pulls you in. I read it all in one sitting and could not put it down. The author does a wonderful job of making the time period and location come alive, and Mary is a very three dimensional character whom I rooted for while knowing that she was not an all together nice person. I kept hoping that Mary would indeed find all that her heart desired, and the first half of the book has the feeling of Moll Flanders. I felt that Mary's cheekiness might end up serving her well, and I imagined that the book would become a romp. Alas, not so. The story turns quite somber, and I felt very depressed after reading it. This is not a flaw of the book, which is very well written, but readers should be aware that this is not a happy day kind of novel."
2,Disliked the characters too much,"I had a very hard time getting through this book. There is not one likable character in this book. The protagonist is unfortunate, but really quite an unpleasant person. The characters are not well developed, and are all (except Abi), dreadful people. Give it a miss."
1,Get Ready for Setback after Setback,This book was sad and depressing from beginning to end. It was stretch for this writter to go from one obsolete 'flyer' and expand it into the tale of depressing events for a girl so young.
5,Loved it!,"Historical fiction at it's best! A little difficult to read at times, as it is a stark and honest look at a young girls life after becoming a prostitute. However, you will get a realistic glimpse of life for women during the 1700's in London and Wales. Get this book, you will not be sorry."
4,"Young girl trades her ""virtue"" for the price of a red ribbon","I appreciate authors who take the time to research the details of a subject before they place a pen to paper, it renders the tale all the more believable. Slammerkin is not a ""prettied-up"" fantasy story about the glittery life of a prostitute, instead, beneath the powdered wigs, pasty make-up and hooped skirts; this novel unblinkingly conveys all the underlying stink and grime of living in London during the 1700's. Within this realistic setting we thus follow the short, traumatic life of Mary Saunders, who is a character who doesn't pine away for the sympathy of the reader, but at the same time, because of her young age and the circumstances that lead to her disastrous destiny, we can't help but feel some measure of pity.Beyond it's believable plot, Slammerkin is well paced and skillfully written. Definitely a book worth reading."
3,Twisty easy read,"Simply ate this book up. Zippy and compelling, full of historical detail that rings true. The writing is deceptively simple, even a bit cheesy, with cerain stock characters and phrases that are almost Harlequin Romance-y. It's also a little disorienting, because as other reviewers here have pointed out, what begins a single point-of-of view book gradually opens up to include several points of view. What you discover by the end, of course, is that the author has pulled off an interesting feat: She has subtly and successfully shifted the reader's symptathies from Mary, the putative heroine to Mrs. Jones, the seamstress. The additional points of view are not sloppiness, as some here suggest, but a way to let the reader slowly gain a more objective understanding of Mary Saunders.By the end, she's like a former friend who has gone irretrievably bad, a friend to whom you must say goodbye, albeit bittersweetly, for your own self-preservation."
5,Excellent Historical Fiction,"I couldn't stop reading this outstanding novel. I was drawn in right from the start. If you liked Tipping the Velvet, The Red Tent, and/or Memiors of a Geisha then this is sure to entertain you."
2,Engaging but a bit forced and inconsistent,"I ordered Slammerkin at the same time I ordered Year of Wonders by Geraldine Brooks. Someone who had read both recommended Slammerkin as the better title. While the story was engaging, I thought the structure was inconsistent and the themes a bit forced . Though the book's narrator is the omniscient third person, you read only Mary Saunder's thoughts through two-thirds of the book. Once Mary gets out of London, though, you start getting insight into a select few other characters' thoughts. It seemed that Donoghue needed to get these thoughts into story to develop the theme, but didn't know how else to do it, and so she took the easy way out and just threw in other characters' thoughts where it served her purpose (without developing the character fully). I'd recommend Slammerkin as a beach/vacation book that you leave behind when you're done.(I am reading Year of Wonders now and am enjoying it more than Slammerkin.)"
2,"Eeeew! Good read, but prepare yourself","The good news is, it's a quick and absorbing read. I came to it after ""Year of Wonders,"" and found it about as readable. But wow - the stuff that's colorful and picaresque and interesting in the early chapters sure starts to wear and get uglier as the book goes on. This is one brutish, nasty, and short novel. YoW I find myself thinking about still. This one I find myself wondering why I read it.Don't mean to trash the author - I think I'll check out another one of Donoghue's books - just not wild about this one - unlikeable protagonist meets ugly end."
3,Still not sure if I liked this book...2 and 1/2 stars?,Slight spoiler alert****Fast moving. I like that but just such a downer....no highs and lows or good vs evil here....I really wanted the main charecter to redeem herself...
1,Disappointed,"I had high hopes for this book. I did not bargain on the vulgarity expressed in this book. It is unnecessarily explicit. And on top of that, I hated the ending. I totally hate the ""heroine"". She is a lost cause. I wish I had never purchased this book. Just crude, crude, crude...and for no other reason but to be crude. There is sensuality that is enriching to a story. Not this story. You will be sorely disappointed with this book."
3,Strong Beginning - Realistic End,"The first half of the book had great characters and a promising set-up. For me it lost a little steam in the second half with nothing interesting added to the plot. Since it was based on a historical figure, the ending was probably set in stone but it was hard to like..."
4,"Not your ""Pretty Woman"" type Prostitute.","Mary is not your ""Pretty Woman"" type prostitute, and thank goodness for that! The story is much more robust with a down and dirty glimpse into the life of a girl who slips into the profession of prostitute. Other reviewers were put off by Mary's character inconsistancies, but the brain of a 14 year old isn't developed enough to make good rational life decisions. For that reason, I found Mary's actions believable and I couldn't put the book down."
4,Slammerkin: A loose gown for a loose woman,Wow! What a terrific story.Mary Saunders was a real person. However not much is known about her life. Emma Donoghue makes a believable story woven of known facts and imagination.She cleverly paints London as it was in the 1760s and the experiences and horrors that the young Mary goes through are brutal and honest. She also describes Mary's disbelief at arriving in Monmouth which she has heard of from her parents all her life and finds it not to be a great city but a small insignificant town.Can she change her wicked ways in Monmouth. Can she faithfully serve the family who has taken her in or is her friend Doll right? Once a whore always a whore?
3,"Good grasp of the time period, but frankly kind of boring","The book is well researched, but lacks a sustaining plot."
1,You are going to want to take a bath after reading this!!,"Sadly I did not read the reviews of this book prior to buying it. A great deal of money has been put into its promotion. My wife could not even finish it, she found it so graphicly disgusting and depressing. [....] There is really no redeeming parts of the book. This is not based on any details of history, so the author could have created any characters, reasons or background. She decided to only have one relationship the two [...] as friends. Sharing a bed, booze and clothes. The men - please we are not all the lowest lifeforms, as she would have you believe. There is no character development or even discription.... we never even find out how the main character looks. There is a reference to the size of her lips and height. As far as the locals and time period. Again, bare descriptions. Unlike my wife I finished it. Hoping to the last page there would be something redeeming. THERE WASN'T!!"
1,But only because zero stars wasn't an option...,"I hated this book, it was grim, ugly and depressing- - absolutely no redeeming value whatsoever. I kept going, though, because I was just sure that it had to get better at some point, but...nope."
1,How bad can this GET?,"I have read much historical fiction -- not to mention fiction from the period here abused, but never before ha the period seemed boring to me. But this time! Even ""sex among the whores"" read like 3-day-old bread: dry, musty, stale, flat, boring. Characters? Well...Why did I have to finish reading this book (it took me long enough too . . .)? If one must complain, one at least must know of what one complains. Now I do know. In spades. Leave this one on the shelf!"
2,Disapointing...C-,"What a disapointment. The book started out so good, dark and mysterious...but then became endlessly dull in the middle and the ending was anti-climatic and predictable.When I read this I was unaware that it was a fictionalized novel about a real person, but even knowing that did not help this book at all. I was amazingly unimpressed."
4,Troublesome,"I found this book to be quite difficult to read. It wasn't the way it was written or the way it was presented, it was the content. For something that was based on true events, this story pulls at the humanity that resides in all of us. I do have to credit Ms. Donoghue for being able to handle the story of this young girl's life in such an accurate and professional manner, yet, just the content of the book was enough for me to put the book down once in a while for a breather. It is a story of the way society affects everyone's life in ways that we aren't able to change, and this is what makes it so difficult to read. The book is exceptionally written and will have people running for their dictionaries to look up words no longer used in today's vocabulary, but it is not a book for people who believe that life is fair, for it will surely shake up everyone's outlook on society."
4,The White Nile by Alan Moorehead,"This book was the source material for the BBC, Time-Life video ""The Search For The Nile"". I was fascinated by the story and the characters who inhabit this rich retelling of 19th century determination, evangelism, jingoism, and adventure.Moorehead's book has led me to other authors, Byron Farwell and David Fromkin among them, who have kept me busy with books for the last twenty years.I recommend this book and any of Moorehead's other titles to anyone with an interest in history and an appetite for a good story well told."
5,A great deal of fun,"Alan Moorehead's book is a blast to read. The adventures of the explorers and imperialists in 19th century Africa are described in exciting detail, yet Moorehead doesn't fail to provide the reader with broader information about the British empire and the changing world. This is the kind of book that inspires the reader to tackle the original journals of Burton, Speke, Gordon, etc., as well more academic histories of the exploration of Africa, and the African peoples."
5,A Must for Understanding Exploration of Africa 1,I read the book 1983 and got a new copy for a friend which I reread. It had not lost any of Alan Moorehead's fascinating way of approaching the subject. Unfortunately the pocket edition was not illustrated! A must for everybody interested in Africa!
3,All illustrations and some maps omitted,"Buy the 1967 softcover edition (isbn 0140019332) instead, it has photographs of quite a few of the characters in the text. The stories revealed in the pages of this book are some of the most fascinating I have ever read, just another example that truth overgoes fiction. The tale is five stars. My 1967 edition had become really tattered so I decided to renew it with this edition. I was very disappointed to discover that all the photographs and engravings of the earlier edition, of Kitchener, King Kabarega, Lord Gordon and his Khartoum palace, Emin Pasha and quite a few more, aren't included here. Gone. I think these original photographs really added a dimension to the story and I lament their passing. Several maps in the earlier book didn't make it either."
5,Fantastic Book,"Don't let political correctness and revisionist history keep you away from this book. This is a fascinating, well written book. Hightly recommended to anyone interested in the exploration and history surrounding the Nile."
2,Did I read the same book?,"I think I must have read the same book as the other reviewers. I mean it clearly included the same subject matter, shared the title and author of the book that the others enjoyed. But I found it incredibly British-centric and, worse still, quite boring. I agree with many of the statements made by the reviewer David W. Nicholas but came to a compeletely different conclusion. This book is certainly condescending and politically incorrect. If I were more interested in the history of this region and period I'd pursue other sources to see how accurate its portrayal of the native Africans and Arabs is, but I'm not. Lest we judge these cultures too harshly, we ought to take a look into what shape the last 120 odd years of ""progress"" have left the Suddan."
1,racist master story-teller,"This is in some sense a hard book to read. On the one hand, Moorehead is a very good story teller. So one feels compelled to read on. On the other hand, with almost every page there are jarring instances of crude racist stereotypes. To read on, one is then left caught in this tension, seduced for a minute into his vividly painted world then suddenly bowled over my another reference to superior races or another description equating blacks with animals. Jolly, engaging poison."
2,Nice try but ...,"From the other reviewers 5 star rating I thought this book would be a winner. But I couldn't connect with the main character, Abby Stanfield, as she was written, to me, one-dimensionally ... ditto her love interest Sarah. I also don't care for the fell-in-love-at-first-sight gambit used by so many authors of lesbian fiction. Where is the depth of character like a Kate Delafield (Katherine Forrest), or Carol Aston (Claire McNab)?Just my opinion, folks, wish I'd kept my $13.59 in my wallet on this one."
3,Better than generally thought.,"Like many, I initially did not care much for Season 5. However, I would give it 3.5 stars now. While there are some plot holes and inconsistancies with the past, it is actually very clever. Perhaps too clever in that you only pick it up fully seeing it over again. I just finished watching the Season 5 DVD's and throughly enjoyed them. The entire season builds toward the ending, which while not excellent is still satisfying. Actually, my only complaint about the ending is that there was not a little more post victory stuff."
2,Slipshod Season 5 writing. Lousy end for a great series,"Season 4 ended magnificently. It had it all..Drama, action, loss, self sacrifice, interesting technology (the arcology)....then it all plopped into the silly muck that was season 5.Boring bar scenes on the lost Tarn Vedran planets albeit with no Vedrans, everyone dressed in raggedy clothes and two artificial suns that somehow give warmth to 9 earthlike worlds. If it wasn't stupid mind games, it was one bar fight after another against hapless thugs and gangs. What about the abyss and the magog? In the last two episodes, which really shouldve been only 1, the writers most have realized vacation time was near and they created a writers convenience to wrap up the whole season 5 mess.Thoroughly unsatisfying.It could have been so-much-more.If you've bought the other 4 seasons and haven't seen any of season 5, (like me) DONT DO IT!>>>just rewatch the last episode of season 4 and dream of what it could have led too."
4,5th Season Andromeda Review,"I loved it. Even though they were stranded in a dark star system, the writing was good with a lot of twists and different outcomes. I did not like the ending - but I didn't like most of the Star Trek endings either - they leave you hanging - not knowing - maybe for a continuation series? I liked the characters and were glad they kept the same cast. The Special Featurette, including the tears, was better as an ending. I would purchase again."
3,"20"" skillet lid does it's job","I bought this lid to cover my Bayou Classics 20"" cast iron skillet. It works, though not perfectly. It does cover the whole opening but just barely - I'm sure Bayou would have had a tighter fit had they made one. It's really light - slightly too light, but again - I'm lucky that it exists. Stu"
4,overall great arrangements,"Overall, the book has many great arrangements (particularly ""Ordinary People"" and ""Stay With Me""). Those songs can sound just like the original. Some of the songs don't translate as well (usually the ones with less piano). However, if you're a fan of John Legend, I definitely recommend the book overall."
5,Music,"The music is true to the actual songs, esp since most of John Legend's songs are on piano! It's def not an easy level book."
3,Where are they?,"Somewhere on the planet Earth, probably in some dusty warehouse in New York, is a box or metal canister containing about a half-dozen 2-inch magnetic tapes. On those tapes, in their pure form, are four nights of recordings of Miles Davis' stupendous band at the Fillmore East. Where are they? Why have they not been found?It seems every outtake, every demo, every alternative version of every Miles recording of the electric era has been found and stuck onto a ""complete....sessions"" compilation.Everyone seems to agree that the main complaint about Miles Davis at Fillmore is the unfortunate (if necessary) editing. Fix it!Columbia/Sony, FIND THOSE TAPES! The performances were outstanding, the material excellent, the recordings top-notch. Let's finally hear the entire performances. THERE IS A MARKET."
3,Ruined Music,"The band was playing the music pretty well. There are great musical moments on here. And the fidelity is quite nice.But the editing is abysmal. Teo and Miles must have been under the influence. In concept, it's crazy - they played roughly the same set on 4 consecutive nights, so present different pieces of each tune on each night but hardly ever a whole tune's length, with the editing as choppy and intrusive as possible.Someday they will edit this music without the editing, the full sets. It will be wonderful. Meanwhile this is frustrating, and for completists only."
4,"A little messy, but great Miles.","Miles and friends did a good job on this one as a whole. They didn't quite fuse together as Miles's earlier groups did, but get it and your ears will thank you."
4,"Great album, but some general comments re Amazon","I REALLY miss the old ""CD-NOW"" site (bought out years ago by Amazon) that had complete session information including musicians lists, etc.Why did they remove that priceless wealth of information?"
2,dismal cut and paste,"I'm sure the music from the four nights was ok, though I don't care much for the Fillmore shows. But here we have a messy cut-and-paste job editing each night's 45-min set into 25 or so and packaging it with lengthy essays about Miles' new sound. Well good luck to anyone trying to get to this stuff by the virtues of this cd alone! For the fans only. The uninitiated ought to look elsewhere for a good 'gateway' disk.Like IN A SILENT WAY, JACK JOHNSON, LIVE-EVIL, ON THE CORNER..."
2,On the Cutting Room Floor,"I've heard the full concerts that made up this two cd set and they are brilliant. However, the concerts have been butchered so much on this album you'll never really get to listen to a coherent song. If Columbia officially released a box set of these concerts, many jazz fans (including myself) would be more than willing to buy it. Unlike Live at the Fillmore East, Live-Evil also involved splicing but it makes sense but it was still great to have the full Cellar Door Sessions released. Fillmore could use the same treatment. All the players on the concerts are in peak form (I just wish Keith Jarrett would stop dissing Miles' electric bands when his electrified playing on them is far more creative than his solo career) and the concerts deserve to be heard the way they were supposed to be."
5,Great Product,Nice drink holder. Replacing the broken one in my boats driving station. Holds my BIGASS cocktail. Really like purchasing almost all items for my company and personally from amazon.
3,Silly,This movie could have been better if the actors weren't so goofy. Humor in kung fu films is usually a standard. But the two main stars in this one sometimes makes the movie unwatchable. Good fights scenes though.
5,A book for Tae Kwon Do practitioners to own,"The best way to learn forms is to train under a master's supervision in the dojang as often as possible. However, if one is looking for a text to support their formal training in the new forms, here it is. Enough said."
2,a little vague,"As an Instructor of children's martial arts, I have already learned the Taeguek forms, I find it extremely difficult on reviewing some of the forms by myself. There are also debates on which book is more accurate. after having purchased this book, I have decided to buy another book that has a better description on stance and direction."
1,Don't Let it Confuse You,"This book is only for the uncommon kind of Tae Kwon Do. It doesn't have the more popular version (sorry about the names being missing). If you want to know about Chun Ji, Tan Gun, Toe San, Won Wyo, Yul Kuk, Chung Gun, Ti Gye, and the others I recomend finding another book because you won't find them here."
1,Licensing?,"The title just shows how much the author knows. Paramedics don't get licensed, we get certified. We work under a doctors license."
1,"If you are looking for a review book, look somewhere else.","As a paramedic student, I hope to have the most accurate and up to date review material. This review book fulfills neither of those needs. Upon showing this book to a number of experienced medics, they outright questioned the validity and knowledge of the author. The facts in this book are incorrect and thus dangerous to anyone hoping to pass the paramedic exam."
3,Medic from Las Vegas,"I recently used this book for a pre-admittance test to my EMS instructor course. I found it helpful because the tests are structured like the National Registry for Paramedics test. As you may know, the NR requires a passing score for each individual section (Trauma, Medical, OB/GYN, Cardiovascular), in addition to an overall passing score. The book gave me insight on my weak points so I was able to concentrate on those. I recommend this book even though it did have some questionable answers to some material (as do most tests), if I had a doubt I looked it up. Also, depending on how recent the book has been updated or which copy you may have, some of the material on ACLS, PALS, and PHTLS may be outdated as there have been recent changes."
4,THUMBS UP,"Sure this book was printed in 2001. And yes there are some errors in the book. And there is not alot of drugs calculations or rhytm strips.Any way,, I know a paramedic that has just passed his NREMT - P exam from studying this book for the new computerized way of testing. The areas that are not in this book, USE OTHER STUDY MATERIAL. For the areas that are are not up to date in this book, correct them in your head. In summary I would recommend this book to any 2008 Paramedic student tying to take the NREMT -P exam. I myself have decieded to study this book. There is no source out there that just gives you the answers. You still have to work hard for what you want.THUMBS UP FOR THE BOOK. For those looking, use the blue 3rd edition along with this one."
3,Mediocre Test Taking Tool,"The book that I purchased was the 2nd Edition (green cover). I just took the National Registry Exam and did pretty well on it. Overall, the practice exams helped me prepare on test taking skills and the type of questions to expect on the National Registry. The Medical and OBGYN/Peds sections of the book were very helpful. However, the Cardiology section was very poor. The exam book does not have any senario strips nor questions on the ACLS algorithms. Also, the book does not contain any Drug Dose Calculation questions. As for the other sections, the prep book does do good job on showing your weak areas. I would recommend this book, but only if you are strong in the Cardiology and Drug Dose Calculation. It should not be your only source for study material."
3,"Yes, licensed paramedics","After reading other comments for this book, I must say that in its defense, Paramedics in Texas ARE LICENSED. We are licensed if we have a formal degree in addition to our paramedic training. So some paramedics ARE licensed."
4,Too small for me :-(,"I ordered these earrings knowing they would be small. If my ear holes had been a bit more toward the edge of my earlobe they might have fit. These earrings are *really tiny* and do not fit me. I need the next higher up size. These are like 3/8 inch, way small for me and also way difficult to even bend/manipulate to open the hoop."
4,Facinating story,"After visiting Ushuia in early 2008, I became interested in the indigenous population of this region. Bridges provides a first hand account of early European contact with the various tribes and the disasterous effects on the native population. A very interesting read."
5,2004 Bachata Highlight (EXCELLENT!),"This is the CD that introduced me to Frank Reyes. How was it? well, nothing but excellent. As a DJ I always find myself skipping through the tracks to get to the real dancefloor hits, but with this CD I did not have to. EVERY track has something to say, every track lifts your soul and gets your feet taping.A well produced CD, Frank Reyes has great control over his voice and puts some nice lirical twists to the choruses. The CD is all upbeat bachata, always remaining romatic and just plain HAPPY. Watch out for the last track though. This one is a Merengue Tipico that ought to get the clubs jumping this year, it certainly will stay in my collection for a long time.Buy it with confidense! :)"
2,Disappointed with Results,"Unfortunately this foil shaver from Wahl did not live up to it's claim.The shaver is harsh and it did not prevent bumps on my neck from appearing after I shaved with it. It is so harsh that it can leave your face irritated for awhile. I'm African American and this shaver does not seem to do a good job shaving short and curly facial hair. The only positive thing about this set is the T-Blade trimmer which is a decent trimmer, which is why I gave the product two stars instead of one."
5,When Lightning Comes in a Jar,Delightful book - great for an older reader to share with a younger listener! Sweetly connects generations.
5,Excellent story for young and young at heart,Patricia Polaco is an insightful author and illustrator. Her ability to keenly draw on her childhood and bring the reader into the story is a gift. I recently bought this book for my mother and grandchildren as a reminder of their time together this summer creating their own lightning in a jar.
1,Another disappointing book,"What bothers me about this book is that the author glorifies and magnifies the differences between Shias and Sunnis at a time when such thing is not needed at all. Yes there are differences but they are not the way the author portrays. Sunnis love ahlu-Bait, love Imam Hussein, love Al-Zahra Fatemah, and the righteous descendants of Prophet Muhammad. To make the impression in the book that this is not the case is not fair, let alone objective or scientific. Sunnis, however, differ in their expression of this love. Sunnis do not injure themselves in Ashoura with knives and many modern enlightened Shia agree with this. They just think that such an expression of love is not permitted. Many modern Shia scholars agree with this.I am not against exploring the differences, actually I think this should be encouraged among the learned and people seeking knowledge. I don't think, however, that this book is a fair, objective, or factual one."
1,Read a better book,"As I read this book I cannot but wonder at whether the author really understands Ahlu-Bait. the real difference between Sunnis and Shias is not anything realted to what the author was trying to lead to. Sunni Muslims love Imam Hussein but love his grandfather more. They express their sorrow over his martyrdom in a way that is acceptable to Allah and not in a way that many Shias do nowadays. The author is trying to note that Shia have more profound love for Imam Hussein as if you cry your heart out this means that you are a true lover. Do Christians love Al-Maseeh more than Muslims just becasue they call him a son of God? I am astonished that many many Shias call for unity on the one hand, and on the other hand are involved in much propaganda about Sunni Muslims who ""converted"" to Shiism. People are free to read whatever they want but I believe that there are better sources to highlight the real differences."
4,Loved it,"He illistrates and describes Islamic history amazingly, and verifies everything with the use of hadiths. Very well written."
2,Incorrect Track Listing,"The Track listing Amazon has for this CD is incorrect and, although I informed them of this mistake, they still haven't changed the information. This is not the Pye/Bronze Anthology, but it appears to be a live concert. I say appear, because I haven't opened the CD yet. The actual Track listing is:1. Introduction2. The Dawn3. Welcome Home4. Ayiko Bia5. Living, Loving Feeling6. Woyaya7. Ke Le Le8. Fire9. Music For Gong Gong10. Beautiful Seven-Y Sharp11. Sunshine Day12. Encore13. Survival"
5,Great Band,I saw Off Kilter at Epcot/Canada a few weeks ago (Dec 2006). I didn't stop for other bands - but thier music stopped me in my tracks and I settled in for the rest of the show. I am here on Amazon to buy a CD. I should have just bought one while at Epcot. I can't wait to get it.
2,"One of Herbert's lesser know works, probably for good reason.","A novel about a catastrophe caused by the release of an engineered plaguethat is only supposed to sterilize White people. A lot of racistovertones, and it looks like Herbert really didn't research his sciencevery well, as the Arabs, who release the virus, are a Caucasian race aswell. Predictably the plague spreads to other racial groups until thewhole world is sterile. I can think of several work arounds the human racecould use to get free of this dilemma, but obviously Herbert couldn't. Hisstyle of writing, that works to well with classics such as Dune, does notcarry through on this one. Not recommended,"
5,Many think this his best,"It is tremendously frightening that this might someday soon become a book for our times. A molecular biologist watches from a building window as his wife and two daughters get blown to bits during a terrorist bombing on the street below. This triggers a vengeful madness that culminates in his developing a disease and infecting those he sees as responsible: The countries of Ireland, Libya, and England.I have met many Frank Herbert fans online, especially on usenet. There is some argument as to what is Herbert's greatest work. Many who have never read the White Plague insist that nothing could top Dune. Many who have read Dune insist that The White Plague is his crowning achievement.I leave it to you to decide."
3,"Brief, but well read","I'm not a regular books-on-tape person, but I missed this book, and wanted to read it again, and when I couldn't find a copy of the printed version, I decided to try it out on tape. While this is no secret, the recording is of a _very_ abbreviated version of the book. However, it was well done, and I suspect that if I hadn't already read the book, I might well not have noticed that anything felt like it was ""missing"". The pieces that were read fit well together, and I thought the reader did a good job with voices and such.If you're looking for the complete work, find a copy of the book somewhere, but if you want only to get the basic story, with a sampling of the passages written, then this recording will do nicely."
1,A Great Start that goes nowhere,"The white plague is a disappointing work by a great author. Like many of Herbert's short stories he had a great beginning but not much else. Unfortunately this is not a short story so it drug on forever and ended leaving this reader unfulfilled and more than a little angry. If you want to read Herbert read all the Dunes, Destination Voids, Jesus Incident and for a change of pace Soul Catcher."
5,Prophetic,"I am sure this book will turn out to be prophetic. With time, it only becomes more relevant. I wish this were not so."
3,"Good idea, bad delivery.","The book was an insanely wild, genius of a concept, but it dragged out painfully. It was work to get through this book."
3,It's an O.K. kind of book,"This book has been sitting on my living roomcouch for close to a month (bought and opened on a friend's recomendation). Granted, I lead abusy life, but this book is taking an unusuallylong time to get through! It may be because thebook I finished before it was _The Handmaid's Tale_by Margarot Atwood, and this novel simply doesn'tcome close to living up to Atwood's novel. Or, maybe,it's because the plot centers on aplague that kills (almost) every woman on theplanet, and the main characters are men wholament the horror of their time while keepingtheir macho political game playing attitudes....That was a little harsh. Let's just say that I'mfinding it difficult to relate to the characters, tofind the plot appealing, and the book interesting.Yet, the novel isn't badly *written*.So, I guess you could say it's just an ok book.Adora"
2,Not as expected...,"Excellent seller!!! Item shipped and arrived quickly. Order was filled as expected... However, the Flag/Banner was not accurately described on product page. Colors are vibrant, but the material is ""see-through"" mesh. Background shows through the material. I was expecting solid flag material to prominently display the excellent design outdoors. I will keep the flag/banner and display indoors instead."
3,Cheap replacement cabin air filter,"The air filter arrived with shipping damage, but I suspected it could be used anyway. It was in fact usable. Since it was made in China I was skeptical at first, but the filter works ok and is a good value for the money."
2,Another ambiguously gay duo.,"This CD just didn't impress me. I think there's some underlying meaning to some of these songs. I think Magoo wants to ride Timbaland, and Timbaland wants to freak Ginuine. I would not be surprised to see these three caught up in some sick love triangle sometime in the near future."
1,one good song,aside from Luv 2 Luv u this disc all sounds the same.Timberland has catchy beats but the Lyrics &the raps are very weak.
3,Great CD,similar to the new Romeo Must Die soundtrack/ lots of R&B and some Rap. Lyrics are missing but the beats are there!
5,Great condition,This CD is in great condition. There are no scratches on CD. It was delievered earlier than stated. The inside cover is in good condition also. I would buy again.
4,"Personally, this CD kicks.",Of the two Timbaland (Tim) is my favorite. On the contrary Magoo (Maganoo)'s voice is the better of the two. The CD is great.
5,I think its da' bomb!! Its a awesome c.d!!,I love this c.d because all their songs have great beats and half of them they play on the radio so you know they have to be good songs!!
5,A classic must-have for any CD collection,"I have had this CD since it first came out in 1997 and it has never gotten boring! There are a multitude of songs that cover every aspect of hip-hop. There are faster, dance tracks and some slow ballads featuring Ginuwine and Aaliyah, with Missy on many tracks. My favs are the non remix version of Luv 2 Luv U, Man Undercover, Smoke in Da Air, and the Up Jumps the Boogie original and remix. Timbaland certainly knows how to work the rap game."
1,I can't believe I actually wasted money on this!,I'm even surprised it got a explicit lyrics label on it!
4,PRETTTY COOL,Luv 2 Love U is my favorite song on this cd. Up Jumps da Boogie is also pretty phat. Definately a must have album.
2,interesting subject but....,fascinating material poorly presented by an author who can't write a coherent narrative. He repeats the same information in the exact same way over and over.
4,Elmo Pops In! (Pop Up Song Book),My daughter loves this book. She plays the songs everyday. She now knows all the characters from Sesame Street. The pop ups are great but just a little flimsy.
5,Love it!,"My son received this as a first birthday present and still reads it everyday (7 months later!) The pop-ups are all torn, but he loves the music. This is one of his favorite books!"
2,Elmo potty book,"Sometimes, putting a popular character on a book doesn't necessarily make it a good choice. This is one of those times. The sounds for this book are cute but the ""story"" itself is very disjointed and, I feel, not very helpful in teaching my son to use the potty."
5,Great sweetener.,"Agave is a healthy alternative to corn syrup and regular sugar. Madhava provides a brilliantly packaged product at an affordable price. Honey has that annoying tendency to spill over the sides and crystallize. This product has a great pointed spout which stays clean without any effort.Use this product in an amount slightly less than regular honey, as it is a little sweeter. Can be used in baking, or just right on top of oatmeal or pancakes. Nutritionally superior to traditionally processed sugar and cultivated without disturbing any honey bees, agave is the ecologically sound way to sweeten your foods.Madhava delivers all of this to you in a conveniently sized bottle."
5,Good bottle cap,"Madhava light has a neutral or mostly neutral taste. I use this with oats and sometimes with nut butters. I like the bottle cap - it's easy to pour into measuring spoons. To open, you need kitchen scissors to cut off the tip. I don't like the dark stuff; I only use the light color. I was using Madhava 17 oz Raw Agave (light), but it isn't currently available. Hopefully, they'll bring back the light organic raw agave."
5,Just like sugar,This agave has a wonderful light taste . To me its no different than sugar it has no aftertaste or strange flavor like stevia does.
5,Fabulous Sugar Substitute,"I love this product. I use it primarily to sweeten my coffee and will expand my uses of it soon. I was using sugar to sweeten my coffee b/c I really do not like artificial sweeteners. Stevia had an aftertaste that I didn't like with coffee. This has no aftertaste and it does not cause me to crave other sugary things. When I use sugar in my coffee, I crave sweet treats to accompany the coffee...I don't have that craving with the agave nectar."
5,Fantastic Food Product,I have been using Madhava Agave for several years now and love it. We have used it in several recipes and it has worked out well. I am borderline diabetic so using this product has helped with keeping me away from taking any Meds.Also I like buying a case of it on Amazon. The savings is great compared to local stores. I like the 12oz bottles. They are covenient to take with you.Excellent product.
5,Agave,Agave Nectar is a natural sweetner that helps lower sugar levels and is great to help fight sugar diabetes. Madhava Pure Organic Agave Nectar Light is the best Agave I've tried. It's a healty option for people.
3,Not great for tea,It taste great but I didn't find it strong enough for tea or for adding to plain yogurt.I'll keep buying it though since I do need to rotate the foods I eat and this will give me another food option. I like the health properties it has as well.I haven't tried it yet but I think the lighter taste would be great for making salad dressings.Diane
3,"Not what I expected , but ok","I didn't see that ths agave was a light color. I had bought the dark one (same company, same ounces ) at my local health food store for over $4 a bottle. The light one is not as sweet and is a little thiner, so you use twice as much!"
2,Not RAW Misleading Title,"They have this listed as RAW. It is not raw and should not be listed as such. There is nothing wrong with it. To be considered raw it should not be heated above about 115 degrees, I believe that is the correct number. Amazon should change the label on this. They used to sell the RAW kind and for some reason, it is not available. The title is therefore misleading."
1,Research before you buy,"I purchased this syrup in a store, not on Amazon. It sounded nice however I did not do my research on agave syrup before hand.Read up on this sweetener first before purchasing it, don't just assume that it's natural or raw. I'm not an expert so I'm not going to preach/teach, but go online and look it up and decide if it's right for you.It has a mild, sweet taste. Like a mild honey and caramel flavor.I think I'll just stick to local honey."
3,Great bathroom book,"If you like optical illusion books, you'll enjoy this one. Its small, chunky size is perfect to flip through for quick reading & the illusions are cool too. I've seen Sterling's previous best-selling title in this format and this one is just as good."
5,Great movie,"Great movie, an was delivered in great shape. A must see to understand Mexican and Latn American politics. Thanks a lot!"
4,German Armored Trains in World War II,"I would recommend this generally informative review of key information about the trains of WW II , with sufficient graphics."
1,Not Worth the Time,Bought the book because it had great reviews and looked beneficial. Once I got it I read through the first couple of chapters and did not find it useful at all. I am an engineer and the the basic skills he presents are taught early on in the undergraduate curriculum. Needless to say I was very disappointed. This may be a good book for someone that is in high school to sharpen critical thinking skills.
5,A Classic for Problem-Solvers,"I found Pollya's ""heuristic"" approach to problem-solving applicable to both mathematical and non-mathematical problems. The goal of the heuristic approach is to study (and use!) the methods and rules of discovery and invention.Here are just some of the questions that Pollya teaches as tools:1. What is the unknown? What is the data? What conditions does the solution need to satisfy?2. Do you know a related problem? Look at the unknown and try to think of a familiar problem having the same or a similar unknown.3. Can you restate the problem? Can you solve a part of the problem.4. Can you think of other data appropriate to determine the unknown?5. Can you check the result?6. Can you look back and use the result or the method for some other problem?Overall, the author provides a systematic way to creatively solve problems. This volume has withstood the test of time for nearly 50 years. I recommend it highly."
5,An essential classic in the field of problem solving,"Pardon the cliche, but: no home should be without this book. Polya's examples are mathematical, but the principles of heuristics and problem solving are universally applicable, whether you are a programmer, a mechanic, a TV repairman, or anyone trying to solve a problem. This is to problem solving what Strunk and White are to writing. BUY IT. I've lost track of my copy, and once I finish this review, I'll be replacing it."
5,Thinking outside of the box,"Critical thinking and problem solving are not stressed in any kind of modern education. Students tend to take a cookbook approach to problem solving and wonder how is it that some people can think circles around them. Polya introduces the reader, in a simple yet rigorous manner with heuristics and examples, to how genius does problem solving. Its fascinating what truly learned people are able to articulate for the rest of us. Learn how to think outside of the box."
2,New Greedy Version Destroys Value,"This new version requires you to buy every address you print out beyond the first 2000. This drastically reduces the value of the program. Frankly, it's marketed in a very sneaky way because they don't make it very clear you're going to be buying these names until you open the box. They need to go back to the old version with unlimited use."
3,Impressive features - faulty website,"I like this product in general, especially for its search features. While you can search from 115 million listing, you can export only a maximum of 2000 addresses - more exports are available at an additional charge (how much I don't know).When registering I encountered several crashes, but after at least three tries and the update downloaded from the web, I got my access code.The registration for the included CD-ROM ""Business Credit Ratings USA"" failed completely, because access to the website used to enter the registration information is ""Forbidden (Error#403) which of course is somewhat lunatic. Trying to contact TechSupport regarding this problem I encountered a faulty link.Summary:Usefull, although ""freshness"" of data is not stated, could have better web-site based support and TechSupport and allow for a larger number exportable addresses."
1,There are better reads,"I purchased this book as a recommendation after reading two Dan Brown books (Angles and DaVinchi) and hoped I found another fun read with time travel sprinkled in. Not... I found I had to read 50% of the pages before time travel was mentioned and then another 25% back in time, when the main premise and mystery only got tied up in the two page Epiloge. My recomendation is move on by."
3,Hire an editor!,"Time Stand Still is a fun, easy read. Not very deep or well developed, but fairly entertaining. What was aggravating about the book was the fact that there were numerous errors: misspellings, grammatical mistakes, mix-ups in character names, and even a mix-up in time zones. (No, the latter had nothing to do with time travel!) Mr. Misak should hire an editor!"
1,VERT DISAPPOINTING!,Oh please! This was a short story expanded badly into a novel. The gist of the story could be told in 30 pages and would be entertaining at that length. The amount of filler was laughable including several paragraphs about the mens room in a bar. Don't waste your money. I'd return it if I could. Hey! Maybe Amazon should allow us to return bad books! OK-just kidding Amazon.
2,At times interesting...,"Time Stand Still was OK, but just that, OK. At times it comes across very amateurish with included details that had nothing to do with the story and seem to be have been included strictly as filler. I found the numerous typos very distracting and could have easily been handled by better editing. There is no real hard science here, unless the use of the term ""quantum computer"" constitutes science. One goes through two-thirds into the book before any time traveling takes place, but the mix of detective work and time travel was an interesting twist."
3,Somewhat Disappointing,"The author takes approximately 110 pages to get to the meat of the book, which is the protagonist's trip into the past. While I realize that plot lines do require time to set up, John Misak overdoes it here with far too much set-up detail. Once the story really gets going, however, it's a pleasant read."
4,I Used This Book to Teach Myself PERL/CGI For The WEB,"Excellent book for learning web-based PERL applications. The examples were concisely and fairly well explained. The appendix does a good job of elaborating in more detail. You probably will not like this book if you do not have a programming background. Also, you'll need a good PERL reference book as a companion. The book does not come with a CD ROM, so you'll have to type out the examples."
2,Nothing about Perl *5* in this book!,"This is an OK beginner book on CGI and Perl, but why in the world did they title it ""Perl 5 for...""? I'm proficient in Perl 4 and I assumed that this book would tell me all about working with objects and all the other new stuff in version 5. Seemed like a reasonable assumption based on the title. However, the only place that Perl 5 is even mentioned is on the cover!! As a general introduction to Perl and CGI, a much better book is ""Visual Quickstart Guide to Perl and CGI"" by Elizabeth Castro."
4,The above review is misleading,"I liked the book, and if you go to the website, you can download all the code for the examples."
2,A bit too light,"A pretty good book for the beginner, but I expected more for my money. Really, more like a pamphlet than a book. Priced about twice as much as it should be."
1,This book is bad.,"While in the beginning it may look harmless, this book ignores CGI.pm, the REAL way to write Perl CGI. Using there pitifully simple interface to the POST method, newbies are led to believe that their scripts work fine using a simple hash. Their supplied function leaves a blatant security hole that any average hacker can use to bomb the script and potentially your web server. All examples are oversimplified and remain poorly explained. The reason other people rate this book as GREAT is because they are not aware of the potential harmfulness that a few lines of insecure code can do. As a webmaster, I am qualified to bash this book. The book follows up by NOT mentioning anything about taint checking, warning flag, or the use of the ""strict"" pragma which should be used in ALL CGI scripts (if not all Perl scripts together). This book is a NO-NO! Real advice on perl/CGI can be found at PerlMonks.org or by reading the CGI manual pages included with every distribution of Perl."
5,GRADE A MILES,"With ROUND MIDNIGHT and KIND OF BLUE,SKETCHES OF SPAIN is among the best of MILES.Not only the title tracks delivers but all the numbers reach their goals of letting you melt into the FLAMENCO flavour in mysterious ways.You probably heard the concerto's adagio before ,but maybe did not know that MILES recorded it if you are not a jazz fanatic.Let there be known here that the bonus tracks are not just fillers.Some say that this is elevator type of music;nonsense,it's just that they could not elevated themselves high enough to get down and listen to it.Worth having in your music library for sure."
2,For devoted Miles Davis fans only,"I think this is the only Miles Davis disk/record I've ever listened to that I honestly do not like. This is most definitely not the ""cool jazz"" of Kind of Blue - it's a very different, brassier, in some places atonal and in-your-face type of jazz. For me, it just didn't work."
2,tone poems don't make it,"Davis plays some of the best trumpet of his career, the arrangements and orchestration are impressive, the sound is impeccable, but with the exception of Track 5 ""Solea,"" it just doesn't swing. The nod to Spanish classical music might have looked good on the charts, but of Davis's collaborations with Gil Evans, this one I can do without."
2,"Even if you love Miles, you may be disappointed","I love Miles Davis, from his early days to most of his work towards the end of his career. But this album is really hard to like. The feel is orchestral; it doesn't swing. The compositions are forgettable and Miles' soloing is eclipsed by the weight of the accompanying orchestra. It's not that this type of effort couldn't succeed, but this one doesn't. Disappointing."
4,Loud Trumpit,"I just got this 'remastered' version and my first impression is that Miles trumpit is too loud. OK, I may be wrong but quite oftern when a classic album gets remastered, volumes get changed. I personaly would like to here more of the other parts of the music than just Miles horn. Whatch out kids, there re-writing history!"
5,Spanish love song...,"Miles Davis working with arranger and composer Gil Evans put together an album that ranked 356 on Rolling Stones Top 500 albums of all time. It is probaly one of his most accessible albums and the tight compositions take you to the Spanish bullfight and quiet burning passion of a long, hot Spanish summer day. Not the the hardblowing, improvisational jazz that everyone associates with Miles but the arrangements and tight composition makes for a very relaxing, enjoyable listen."
2,Pura Fama,No es ni cerca la mejor interpretacion de Davis y es por lejos la peor colaboracion que tuvo con Evans.
2,a combination of errors,"A short word of warning. Those who expect a synergistic union of davis-esque jazz and ""classical"" music should listen before they buy. For myself, the combination is static."
2,Muzak-y Miles,"This one doesn't fly for me; thanks to the torpid big band arrangements, it's the musical equivalent of an overstuffed sofa. Good ""classy"" bsckground music for a cocktail party perhaps, but to sit down and seriously listen to all the way through? Nope. Of course, I might not be really qualified to judge it, since I don't care for any of the Davis-Evans collaborations, and my favorite Miles album is ""Dark Magus!"" Hardcore Miles is the Miles for me, his ""pretty"" stuff I can do without."
3,Not as good as The Tijuana Brass,"This is a very nice album. I like Miles Davis. However, he's no Herb Alpert."
1,Threw it in the garbage,I loved Bitches Brew and Kind of Blue.This reminds me of someone practising on trumpet. I couldn't stand it. This is dead. I can't believe anyone liked it.
3,Essential???,"This is one of the low points of the Miles-Evans collaborations. Its not awful, but is not a great Miles Davis album. Esential recording? Not a chance. Go for the originial Concierto de aranjuez by Rodrigo and if you want to listen to the best of Miles-Evans get Miles Ahead or Porgy and Bess."
4,Nice Spanish Vibing Jazz (Rating: 8 out of 10- -4.0 stars),"Miles Davis' 1960 album Sketches Of Spain shows a wide variety of Jazz with a few Spanish sounding instruments, which highly explains the reason for the album's title. The horns on the album are so deep and the Spanish bells throughout the background helps elevate the sound. The tracks that I enjoyed the most are ""Concierto de Aranjuez (Adagio)"" and ""Solea"", both songs clocking in over 10 minutes. It's great because both songs are built up to their climax deep in the track. It's a great jazz album for those who are interested in the genre, but it falls short of what most consider his best albumKind of Blue(which many, as well as myself hold high regards to). Still a wonderful album, conducted by Gill Evans (you can hear him talking in the background at the end of a few songs), that is a definite for any musical collection. Peace."
5,Obra de Arte,La versión de Miles del concierto de Aranjuez merece 5 estrellas y el precio del CD. Un exelente CD de la mano de Gil Evans
3,Somewhat ambivalent to this,"This certainly will not be one of my favorite jazz plays. Likely, it stems from its beginning, one of favorites:Concierto De Aranjuez. I'm afraid that this interpretation just doesn't set well with my ear.The rest of the numbers seem not the best of recording clarity, and lack luster, whatever. The improv work I'm sure takes great skill and effort, but it's not my kind of sounds.Certainly, others with more jazz exposure than I feel strongly that this is a essential classic, as evidenced by the many reviewers on this site. I will continue to listen with an open mind, but for right now, this isn't my fav kind of jazz."
4,sketches of sketches of spain,"there's not much more anyone can say about this recording, those of us who like it really like it and probably continue talking it up.i owned the vinyl copy, without the additions, and that's how i grew accustomed to listening to it as a total piece of music. the cd copy left on the player playing the additional pieces becomes a new listening experience, one i don't really appreciate.i also have a cassette copy, without the additions. not too long ago i was on a beach with headphones, listening to sketches of spain, while watching the water of the sound as it flowed in from the ocean against the blue sky, filled with seagulls and the sun shining. a very pleasurable listening experience of sketches of spain. i doubt any other piece of music would had made the day so pleasurable."
5,"A brooding, brilliant recording","Miles Davis magic trumpet pays hommage to Joaquin Rodrigo's beautiful ""Concierto de Aranjuez"" on one his best albums in his storied career. Davis and the castanets give Rodrigo's famous classical work a wide array of rich tonal modes and colors that take this opus to another level. The haunting ""Solea"" is another wonderful piece in this session, with Davis' trumpet expressing the loneliness and sorrow as would a flamenco singer, accompanied by a jaunty bass line that gives this track so much appeal. A very nice fusion of sorts of jazz and flamenco music by the great Miles Davis and arranger Gil Evans."
2,It's not Ironwood Revisited ....,"it's a poor continuation of what should have only been one book. That's the problem with sequels ... they just don't cut it .......Five years have passed and our Hero, James, returns to the school at Ironwood to meet up again with Cora, the headmistress and some of the most salacious of the students....You can imagine the rest is boring drivel ....."
4,Spike Milligan - the edge of lunacy,"If you are an afficionado of the Goon Show, and of the many books that Spike wrote, then this video is a ""must see item"". If you are unfamiliar with the works of Milligan, or do not appreciate his humour, then this DVD is not for you. The DVD is full of personal family involvement and is of interest to those who aspire to greater knowledge of an unusual, talented, brilliant, comical and somewhat unbalanced personality. Many of the world's greatest comics have been manic depressives (Tony Hancock committed suicide) and Milligan fell into the category of manic depressive.I will watch the DVD many times. I consider Spike Milligan to be one of the greatest humorists of all time."
1,Looks good but doesn't stand up,"I received the SS Triquetra Celtic knot earrings. The engraving was detailed,the earring itself was a very thin metal and bent out of shape easily. The backings were tiny and I lost one within two weeks."
4,Beautiful earrings,"These are gorgeous earrings, very detailed. Certainly on the large side of 7mm (closer to 8-9), but still very nice."
1,3 copies malfunctioned,"If I had something to review, I would, but we received three different copies of the DVD and they all failed at the same spot (Scene 31). The sound keeps going, but the Video froze. We tried it on 4 different machines and no dice. My father in law loves this movie, but it would be nice to be able to watch it!"
4,Fabulous restoration!!!,"We all know the film is a masterpiece but now, with this new edition, we can watch it in the best possible conditions. The work on the restoration and on the blu-ray edition is fabulous! It's like if it had been filmed last year! Picture and sound have been improved at their best. I've only given 4 stars because the special features section has no foreign subtitles. Warner haven't done a good job with the subtitles on the bonus features. The back cover says ""French, Spanish, German, Italian and Portuguese"" but NO, there are only English subtitles. It's a deceptive advertising, a big mistake and a total disappointment because the special features section contains many interesting documents. Unfortunately, foreign buyers can't appreciate that section! I've checked the French blu-ray edition and it is absolutely the same mistake. So, if you want the subtitles on the special features, forget that blu-ray edition!"
3,Beware the average transfer!!!!!!!!!!!,"For those of you who are Hitchcock fanatics, pleased with only the most complete and perfect versions of his films, keep looking. This movie is as great as it ever was, but the DVD treatment here is pretty bad. The picture and sound elements need some major help. The extras are nice, but you are paying for the FILM after all aren't you!? So move right along and keep your eyes open for a Criterion Collection edition. This film deserves MUCH, MUCH more."
5,The Man in Lincoln's Nose . . .,". . .is what Hitchcock originally wanted to call this movie. He gets the lion's share of the credit for this well-crafted classic but you also have to give credit to Ernest Lehman, the screenwriter. Anybody ever read what William Goldman said about this movie in ""Which Lie Did I Tell?""? He was very complimentary of the screenplay, pointing out that about a dozen plot points are all tied up in the last minute or so of the film.And how can you go wrong with Cary Grant? The great thing about Grant was that unlike most freakishly beautiful movie stars, he always came across as self-deprecating & not especially impressed with his own good looks. I think that's what made him so endearing. Never more so than in this masterpiece."
4,North By Northwest,"This movie is one of Hitchcock's masterpieces. When I watched it, I noticed that there were many differences between 1960s and today, which were about fashions, life styles, romances, technologies, and actions. While for the time the clothing, scene designs, and special effects must have seemed very modern, today the styles are hip and retro. Moreover, when you watch carefully, you can find un-changed scenes such as the pub which is in Plaza Hotel and Mt. Rushmore. If you watch this movie, you can find many things about 50s fashions. I like this movie and you should watch this great masterpiece!"
2,north by northwest,the delevery was fast but the movie had to be played in secondary option which means that only certin dvd players can play it but it ok
2,North by Northwest,"I was disappointed in this video because I thought it was going to be the movie. Instead, there was almost constant commentary by the screenwriter Ernest Lehman during the time the movie was playing. His dialogue blocked out a lot of the movie dialogue. It actually is a video about how the movie was shot. It does say on the back of the DVD case that there is commentary but I didn't realize it would be all the way throughout the movie. This might be a good video for people who are interested in how a movie is made."
1,Overrated,"The plot has more loopholes than a fishnet. A good thriller should have a logical and coherent plot, this one is all dramatic and no logic. Sadly because its famous the film isn't reviewed based on its merits but its reputation."
1,Devective DVD Cost Me Money & Time,"I very much wanted a copy of this film. When the DVD arrived, it played successfully for 1 hour & 25 minutes. Then it froze. I tried everything to get it to play further. No luck.Sent it back to the provided. He insisted that I send it back to him by media mail, ignoring my desire not to send this useless disk anywhere. I sent it back. Eventually, he refunded a fraction of the mailing cost, plus the full cost of the DVD. I ended up purchasing the DVD elsewhere for a higher cost because the original supplier did not have a replacement.He should have known before he sent it that this was defective merchandise."
4,A Bit Missing,A little bit of railroad history was cut from the movie in the BluRay release. I do not know why such a brief scene was deleted except the editor of the BluRay thought something was amiss and jarring. The New York Central 20th Century Limited had an agreement with the Santa Fe Super Chief to attach a Pullman first class sleeper car from the arriving Super Chief in Chicago and take it in to New York City. Thus the passengers on the Super Chief did not need to transfer with their luggage from Dearborn Station to LaSalle Street Station. The whole car was switched over to the 20th Century. The reverse was true for Super Chief through passengers from NYC to L.A. In the the newly released BluRay version a brief scene which showed the silver Santa Fe car in the middle of the NY Central 20th Century Limited gray consist exiting a tunnel in New York City heading north was deleted. A bit of the original was therefore cut.
5,Let me put it this way,"I want to buy a projector just so I can watch this movie as if it was the fifties again. This is a model for what blu-ray transfers should look like.Gosh darn, just writing this review makes me want to admire Cary's annoyingly fantastic tan and Eve Marie Saint's equally annoying (but shocking, earth shattering) beauty again.Just buy it.CAN WE GET ALL THE HITCHCOCKS ON BLU-RAY NOW!!!??? PLEASE????"
5,off topic,"Years ago I owned the full screen version of this movie on laserdisc. When the widescreen version of the movie came out on laserdisc I bought that. I decided to do an A/B comparison of the 2 and to my surprise quickly realized that the wide screen version of the movie was just the full screen version with the top and bottom blanked out, and in fact the full screen version actually had more information on it (although nothing useful, just more fore ground and background). I have never seen this on another movie, usually you see all the extra pans necessary to keep the action on the screen. I was wondering if anyone else noticed this and if there are other similar movies out there."
5,A Cinema Classic,"This Alfred Hitchcock film is a definite classic.It features Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) as a victim of mistaken identity. He is thought to be a spy and has several 'bad guys' trying to kill him. When Thornhill starts his day, he is just a regular businessman. Before long, his world is turned upside down.Eva Marie Saint plays Eve Kendall who is Thornhill's love interest. She also wears some other hats in this movie. I will forego mentioning more about her to avoid any spoilers.The action ranges from the United Nations building in Manhattan to the top of Mt. Rushmore as well as several others in between.There are several twists and turns throughout. This is a very good show that is well worth watching."
5,The Hitchcock film to end all Hitchcock films.,"This 50th anniversary edition is a must for and fan of the movie, or of Hitchcock in general, and it's even on Blu-Ray!The book pages and whole set up draws you in and looks beautiful on shelf. Included are many poster pictures and behind the set photos and a synopsis and summery of this amazing movie. There is nothing more you could ask for about this item, but if I was to be picky, I would have made a better menu interface. We all know the power Blu-Ray menus can achieve with time spent working on it."
4,Still a classic,This Hitchcock film -- filled with clever wit after the darker Vertigo of a year earlier -- is still an excellent film. My contemporary university students loved it.
5,Excellent,"This movie is in excellent movie in movie history and deserves it's place among the 100 best movies of the 20th century. The script is excellent and riveting, the acting very good and Eva very sexy. See this movie if you haven't already, it's worth it."
3,OK movie,"I thought the story was somehow interesting.The story wasen't boring.When I heard this film was made in 1959 I thought this might be new for the audience in those ages.However,for me the scenes were quit unnatural.It didn't have the reality. When I saw the last scene I thought this is the ordinary ending we can see in Hollywood films."
1,Don't be fooled by the fanboys... This is NOT a great movie,"This movie is a waste of time. Where do I start? The dialogue is horrendous, and the plot lacks direction. The acting is robotic and exaggerated. How did this ever get published? If this wasn't by Hitchcock you never would have heard of it. And I wouldn't have wasted my time with it."
1,ONLY IN WIDESCREEN - DON'T BUY THIS ONE!,"Great film, beyond a mere 5 stars, but the cropped video presentation sucks. Absolutely not worth one cent of your money until it comes out in widescreen. If it's one of your favorites you probably have no choice but to settle for this one, but it's just a shadow of its former self. Try to find a used copy for a couple bucks if you can."
1,NO audio no recourse,"As much as I love Alfred Hitchcock, I was very disappointed by this Amazon offering. There was no audio at all, and I had no recourse once I purchased it. It was maddening to watch the clock tick as my investment flew out the window. Doubt that I'll rent from Amazon again with this kind of quality to look forward to."
4,"""Oldie, but goodie","Cary Grant does not do a bad job. Just wanted to view an oldie for a change tonigh, OK? Try it yourself"
4,great work regarding 1959~!!,"It was indeed a great movie.You will experience the same confusion which Roger Thornhill did because brilliant Hitchcock shows you just a little bit of information about the mystery he unfolds. This gives the film tension and thrills, fascinating the viewer. This film is famous for some dramatic scenes like the cropduster's attack, the witty escape from the auction house ,the fight on Mt.Rushmore and so on. Hitchcock didn't forget to add some humor with his outstanding suspense and tension and Cary Grant is talented enough to deliver his lines. Eve Kandall is also very attractive for romance during the danger which makes the film richer.Wonderful~~!!"
5,One of Hitchcock's Best,"I won't go into a long review of the story of North by Northwest. Many other reviews do this justice far better then I ever could. I will say, though, that this is one of my favorite movies by Alfred Hitchcock.The quality of the DVD is excellent, one of the best transfers I've ever seen and it looks stunning on my HDTV. The bonus features are also outstanding, more then enough for any DVD bonus features junkie or Hitchcock fan.I highly recommend this."
5,Cliffhanger,"Certainly one of the great classics of alltime and proof positive that they don't make movies like this anymore! From the instant when the dazzling 3-D artdeco credits appear, we're onboard for the ride of our lives, actually the lives of hero Cary Grant (1904-86) and Eva Marie Saint. The plot of this 100 percent attention-keeper thickens as its characters sicken. Notable in the glorious cast are the handsomely ignoble James Mason (remember him? 1909-84) and ever-dapper Leo G. Carroll (who later played the ghost in the TV series Topper). Superbly angled cinema shots feature lush hotel interiors - the elegant UN - an aerial shot of ant-tiny Cary Grant in existential torment against desolate grasslands - and closeups of Mount Rushmore, which Hitchcock had dreamt of shooting, here becoming a backdrop of life-and-death drama. Of the 50-some films of Sir Hitchcock (1899-1980) I'd rate this in the top three, with Psycho and Rebecca rounding out the bases."
5,The Best Film Ever!,"On TV I swallowed this film already 19 times, in German. Afterwards, I saw it two times in an English Cinema. At last, I bought the English version and, up to now, I enjoyed this video 5 times. Every time I saw it I had to repeat the famous Auction Scene at least ten times. The mixture of excitement and Cary-Grant-humour and the excellent music make this film a big big event. I am looking forward to seeing it again next time."
3,North By Northwest,"I love the movie, it deserves five stars, but the DVD was damaged, so I had to return it. I am waiting for a new copy to be sent to me. (I shipped back the damaged version.)Lisa Willis"
3,Most sheerly entertaining and enjoyable . . . ?,"Not quite. I wanted to see this movie, as I've heard so much about it. It is supposedly one of Hitchcock's greater works. I watched it with high expectations. It wasn't a bad movie. However, it got a little long, and the suspense wasn't that great. If you really want a good Hitchcock, watch ""Rear Window,"" and ""Torn Curtain!"" These two are, in my opinion much better movies, and much more suspenseful! There are many, many other movies that are a lot better than this. I don't see where critics get their ideas on what is and isn't a good film. If you're a fan of Hitchcock, watch it because of that, but don't hold your breath."
3,Overrated!,"So many scenes are forced and not credible, when you think about it. Why was he lured to an open field and how was a plane supposed to kill him .. why not just run him down on a Chicago Street, or just knife him, as was done at the UN. And why was that fellow killed at the UN anyway? It seems the only reason was to put Cary Grant in the position of a murder . . he could have murdered anyone, anywhere . . . How convenient that Cary Grant just hapened to meet Van Dam's mistress on the train and why did she lead him on and then drop him. Makes no sense. Either does it make sense that his mother is his own age . . . couldn't they find an actress at least ten years older than him. She looks his own age too. This movie doesn't wear well at all..."
1,Horrible Transfer!,"The movie is of course great but this production is horrid! The pixelation is worse than any other DVD I have, to the point that it's extremely distracting. A very poor product - will stick to Criterion from now on though this means I will miss out on some great movies."
5,Love the movie but delivery was terrible.,I ordered this movie along with a couple other classic movies all from Amazon. All movies were great and in perfect condition. However I was using my trial Amazon Prime experience for 2 day shipping and I was utterly disappointed. I ordered the movies on the 9th of January and they did not arrive until January 19th. I did not receive any information from amazon about problems or delays with my order. I have ordered over 15 or 20 orders from Amazon over the past year using the regular free account and never had shipping problems before. Needless to say I canceled my Amazon Prime membership and am sticking with their regular service.
5,Absolutey Hitchcock,A spellbinding adventure from beginning to end. It has everything from murder to brief comedy. Gloriously Hitchcock!
5,One of the best intrigue movies ever,"I first saw North by Northwest about three years ago, and I immediately put it among my top 50 favorites of all time. I recently got to see it again on DVD, and this time I then watched it with the running screenwriter's commentary and watched also the separate features.I won't rehash the plot here, so I won't reveal anything to the newcomer to this film. The first time I saw it I wondered ""What could possibly be going on here?"" The extras on the DVD really explain how this all came about, and I am glad that director Alfred Hitchcock and screenwriter Ernest Lehman were able to brainstorm out this spellbinding thriller, based on a bunch of ideas they had thought up.I notice they call it a comedy. I still don't really get that feeling about it as a whole, but it doesn't really matter. If Fargo and Pulp Fiction are comedies, then I suppose this can be one too."
4,Classic Hitchcock,"This was a well-done thriller with a lot of twists and turns along the way. The closing scene (on Mt. Rushmore) was a bit of a gimmick, but it was an entertaining and suspenseful movie."
1,Very poor color quality,I am extremely disappointed with this DVD. The color quality is very poor. The skin looks very green in most of the scenes. It really detracts from the story as I kept thinking they all looked like Frankenstein. The sound is also very low and I had to turn the volume on the TV up to 30 (when it is usually at 10). I would not recommend this version to anybody. The extra disk does not make up for the poor quality.
4,Exciting chase,"Cary Grant is Roger Thornhill, an advertising executive who gets mixed up in espionage when he is mistaken for a secret agent named George Kaplan. He meets up with the beautiful and mysterious Eva Marie Saint and the two embark on a dangerous game of cat and mouse that culminates in a chase across Mount Rushmore.This is a suave and intelligently scripted entertainment, although it is quite contrived at times. After all, could anyone really cradle a dying man and pluck the knife out of his body by accident the way Grant does at the UN? And, handsome though he may be, Grant seemed a little old for a hottie like Eva Marie Saint to be throwing herself at him without an ulterior motive. It seemed odd to me that he never appeared to question that her attraction to him was spontaneous and genuine. Maybe I'm nit-picking. James Mason and Martin Landau are fantastic as the villains!"
5,A spider's web,"This movie is great. It reminds me of a spider's web. Everyone is tangled, but it is how they are tanglet that makes the difference. I really like the music that is used to give it the murder-feel. It also has my favorite actor Martin Landau!!! So, if you are looking for a movie with twist and turns see this movie."
5,North By Northwest 1959,"Cary Grant (1904-1986) teams with director Alfred Hitchcock (1899-1980) for they fourth and final time in this superlative espionage caper judged one of the American Film Instutes Top-100 American Films and Spruced up with a NEW DIGITAL transfer and Remixed in DOLDY DIGITAL STEREO . He plays Manhattan advertising executive plunged into a realm of Spy ( James Mason 1909-1984 ) and countesy ( Eva Marie Saint (1924 - ) and variously abducted , framed a murder , chased and in another signature set pieces , Crop-dusted . He also holds on for dear life from the facial features of the Presidents on Mounth Rushmore (backlot sets were used ) But dont expect the master of suspense to leav star of audience hanging . A superb movie that take you thru America of 1959 , beautiful locations . High Quality transfer . Recommended Higly !"
5,Another Hitchcock-Grant masterpiece,"Action and suspense are the two words that could never be described better than by the title ""North by Northwest"". Cary Grant(who had worked previously with Hitchcock in Suspicion,Notorious,and To Catch A Thief) heads off a cross counrty thriller that is not only exciting but witty and over-all well directed. Right up there with the other Hitchcock masterpieces and probably the best, next to Vertigo, this a must see."
4,The gasping Mount Rushmore finale is unforgettable.,"This film may be a bit complicated to follow at first, but quite simply it's another classic Hitchcock cat-and-mouse story. This time it's Cary Grant on the run. The gasping Mount Rushmore finale is unforgettable. This DVD version is not the squeezy widescreen, but is almost a full-screen. There is a good documentary called ""Destination Hitchcock: The Making of North By Northwest"" hosted by Eva Marie Saint. Also on this DVD is the Hitchcock trailers and the tv spot. Alfred Hitchcock's traditional cameo appearance is at the start of this film, so you can sit back and totally relax and enjoy the picture."
5,Best Hitchcock movie ever,"This has always been a favorite movie of mine. I had to have the Blu Ray version.The movie is witty, suspenseful, and fast paced."
5,I was an Extra on the Set,"YES, I was, and it was great watching Eva Marie Saint and Cary Grant in the middle of Grand Central Station in New York City as they shot a very brief scene in the station and all of us walked on and off the set. I guess we did it about 20 times. Then I had to wait for the film release which was perhaps a year later. What a bummer - I was cut in the production print. And that finished my movie career. Mr. Hitchcock was very quiet on set, and Ms. Saint was great with all the people around her. And the film was one of Hitchcock's best. Spend the money on this oldie but goodie"
3,"Great movie, Bad DVD/unplayable","The movie itself is excellent, and the way in which the DVD was made as for menu was fine, BUT, there appeared to be a problem with the manufacture of the DVD disc itself.I purchased the movie and watched it, but right at the middle of the film (during the auction house scene) the DVD would become unreadable, with only bits of sound or a refreshed frame here and there. The unreadable nature continued for all chapters to the end of the movie (thus, the second layer was unreadable, as the first played perfectly). I returned the disc for replacement, and the second DVD had the exact same flaw at the exact same time. Thus, a manufacturing defect. Problem reproduced on 2 DVD players, and in a new computer as well.Good movie, good menus, bad discs."
5,Hitchcock and Cary,"Self-assured Madison Avenue ad exec Grant inavertently gets involved with international spies when they mistake him for someone else. His problems are compounded when he's framed for murder.The movie where Grant and Saint dangle from Mount Rushmore and a plane chases Grant through farm fields. An exceptional performance by Grant plus plenty of plot twists (which are mixed with tongue-in-cheek humour) make this one of Hitch's most entertaining films (some say his best). Laserdisc includes letterboxing, digital soundtrack, Hitchcock interview, production and publicity photos, storyboards and the original trailer."
5,An All-Time Great Mystery-Thriller,"Note: Your ""helpful"" votes are appreciated. Thanks""North by Northwest"" begins when a man is mistaken for a CIA agent. He is soon caught up in deadly chase all over the country. It ends, of course, with the famous scenes on Mount Rushmore.I'll keep my review short. Longer reviews are best read after seeing the movie. Nevertheless, I would note that I was surprised at all the sexual innuendo in this movie. I wasn't offended, but Hitchcock was way ahead of its time on that score. The two lovers were really hot.I think we show too much nowadays and loose some of the mystery of sexual encounters. Just talking around a subject can be very sensual.I would also recommend ""Vertigo,"" by Alfred Hitchcock. This is one of the ten best movies ever made--very compelling.Alfred Hitchcock The Masterpiece Collection - Psycho / The Trouble With Harry / The Man Who Knew Too Much / Vertigo (DVD)"
1,You Know What Really Annoys Me About Amazon???,"It's not the fact that they allow reviews to be published before a review is even out. That annoys me. It's not that they sometimes don't put aspect ratios up or put the wrong aspect ratios up. That annoys me. What REALLY annoys me is that they take reviews from other previously released discs, in this instance old DVDs of North by Northwest, and link them to a new disc like this (which isn't even out as I type this), the WBs 50th anniversary North by Northwest DVD. I guess the braniacs at Amazon.com and Amazon.UK don't think that anyone cares about the disc itself. Anyway, this is why I am giving Amazon 1 star. I would give them a 0 if they allowed me to. A pox..."
2,Bailed after 15 minutes,"So this is the great North by Northwest by the great Hitchcock? How did I live all this time without seeing it? Easily. First 15 minutes is just ""You are too."" ""No I'm not."" Can only take so much. I think the biggest problem may be this the first Cary Grant movie I have ever attempted to view, and it turns out I just don't care for his acting."
1,Not the movie's fault but...,Hitch's movie is great but the streaming was wretched.I gave up on watching it and won't use Amazon's stream again after a 2nd movie worked the same way. I miss my old netflix.Too bad regular TV with so much promise when it came out has ended in reality shows and other stupid games. All that's left is Public tv with their countless cooking shows and antique road shows. I miss the hosts and old movies where I watched this movie first with my Mom.Sadly when I tried to do the same with my daughter the movie kept stopping and freezing so we gave up.Amazon- fix your streaming. The classics deserve better.
1,DVD stops working 1/2 way through,"This is one of my favorite Hitchcock films. Unfortunately the DVD that I bought from Amazon marketplace is defective. I didn't try to watch this until after the return period (so money spent was lost). Midway through the film, when Cary Grant is at the auction house, the DVD starts showing just pixels, skips, and nothing further can be seen even when trying to advance to other scenes. The DVD disc itself was brand new, no scratches, so there must have been something wrong with this batch. I hope Warner re-releases this soon."
2,Odd woman out,"While I agree that this is a very sleek looking film and there is something appealing about being mistaken for a spy-I really felt as if the plot is nothing more than a series on convenient incidences. I'm sure that this was cutting edge material for a film in 1959, it just strikes me as silly now. But from the silly idea of let's liquor him up and drive him off a cliff to a crop dusting plane plowing into gas truck, I honestly couldn't stop rolling my eyes to the back of my head. And I absolutely wasn't feeling the abrupt ending. I love you Hitchcock and Cary Grant, but this one wasn't for me."
3,Cheap but usable typewriter...,"This is a cheap manual typewriter as the previous reviewer noted. The one I had 20 years ago of a similar design was much better than this, but there was competition back then for quality manual typewriters. If you want to bang out a rough draft in the middle of the woods (or on the balcony) without running a cord, this is better than nothing. You should get an electronic typewriter or a computer for anything else."
1,buyer's beware,i purchase this product and it doesn't type very well. Some letters doesn't even work. I've tried to return the product and email the companies several time and no reply. So much for guarantees. Do not buy this product!!!
1,Worst typewriter I have ever owned!!,"Back in high school I had to type my papers with manual typewriters and they all worked great. This one, however, has been the worst of all the typewriters I have ever used. It is cheaply made, the ribbon moves all the time, the keys get all tangled, etc., etc. PLEASE, DO NOT BUY THIS TYPEWRITER unless you want to throw you money away!"
3,type writer that wouldn't,This type writer was a different model and color than the one advertised at Amazon. When it came I liked the body as it had some weight to it. However I couldn't use it. I had to spend $17.25 for a new ribbon to be shipped. It was advertised as like new. I would say a slight oversight .
2,I was disappointed because,"The item shown and described was white, what I received was black, and i had received no option or explanation."
1,Worthless,I had to throw the product away. It is difficult at best to operate. I had a Royal typewriter in college. This one was useless. My wife is disabled and it requires so much finger pressure to operate the keys that she was unable to type anything. Also the letter registration is so poor that there are fuzzy lines around each letter no matter how hard or softly you press the keys. I wish I had known in advance that the new version of the Royal manual typewriter is a toy and not a real typewriter.
5,You'd Better Love Him,"""Haven't We Met"", the hard swinging ""You'd Better Love Me"", and ""One in a Lifetime"" will blow you away! ""I Know Your Heart"" is fantastic and swings hard and fast as well. The slow midtempo latin stuff gets you in the mood in a hurry. Buy this album, a classic!"
2,"Singing Is Great, Arrangements Make It Almost Unlistenable","I am a big fan of Torme from his latter years. To listen to this CD after listening to his work on Concord is a revelation.The singing is great, the songs are top-notch. But the musicians and arrangements are putrid. One can get diabetes from the sugar in them. It is as if Mersey (the arranger) had a quota to put every effect and every instrument into every song. The Nearness of You is just one example, so is Rankin's Haven't We Met.Compare this to Torme's work with Buddy Rich or with his quartet. This comes FAR behind those great CDs."
4,Fascinating,"During his years in Paris, Bud Powell continued to struggle with mental, health and substanc problems, emerging numerous times with recordings that occasionally matched his earlier (ridiculously high) standards, but more often, were merely solid. This is one of them. It is fascinating, however, to hear Powell play the music of his longtime friend Thelonious Monk. In his late years, Powell's playing became increasingly spare---and more Monk-like in approach. ON this recording, you can hear how what they had in common, even if their piano stylings were, on the surface, different."
2,Wish it was better,"I liked the first book and look forward to Book 3: however, this just didn't satisfy me as a reader or comic fan. There's been a lot said about the typos and missing words: it happens a lot through out the book. The story, however, was too drawn out in some areas and didn't explain enough in some. One thing that really bothered me was the author describing Malovio's ring being vulnerable to wood; it should only have been vulnerable to ""yellow"" if it was a Corp. ring. The book's jacket cover would have you believe that Hal Jordan is a significant part of the book, but he only appears for the briefest time. I hope there is more depth in the third installment."
5,hercules and iolaus poster,"I am a HUGE Hercules/Kevin Sorbo fan and my husband surprised me with this print as a Christmas present. I LOVE IT!!!! The service was quick, the product was in excellent shape and it's just a beautiful picture!!"
3,ALL THAT GLITTERS.....,"This isn't a book for everyone - unless your really into the whole Anglophile thing then it's pure gold. I had read the other Blow books and several other books like THE SOULS which profiled the generations prior to Simon's period. This book brought a lot of loose ends together and made clear the type of life young Simon lead. A sad inner look at a glittering exterior way of life. I enjoyed it and I hope you will, too."
2,Not my favorite,"After using Lonely Planet and Rough Guide I wanted to give Let's Go a chance. Although it did give most of the information needed, it's writing style was annoying and opinionated. It also did not have all the maps needed, nor were the existing maps very easy to find. Although I liked the smaller size, I felt they cut too much out and gave too much useless information on pages that could have been used more wisely."
4,good likeness,The author gives a step by step approach for modeling a likeness in clay. Very helpful and good at using calapers to get the correct demensions to start with. I would recommend Bruno Lucchesi's books also as he is a modern day master.
2,Disjointed,"A valiant effort, but I found this book hard to follow...many of the essential steps seem to be missing...perhaps the book is geered towards only the advanced. I was dissapointed by the characterish results of the approach and was hoping for more of an attempt at ""fine"" art."
3,Light-duty knives,"It is a pretty good deal for this set but these are strictly light-weight (literally and figuratively) knives. If you're a semi-serious cook avoid these low-end Farberware products. They are durable, dishwasher-safe. The chef knife is useful for cutting and serving pies. That's about it. The Farberware Professional series is a better deal for a bit more money."
2,Farberware 23 piece cutlery review,"The carousel did not look as nice as it did in the photo, the knife handles were kelly green (in the photo they appeared black or hunter green) and I felt the handles had a very plastic look to them. The cutting surfaces seemed good. The gadgets fall off the holders. I am not pleased with the set"
2,Nice design but cheap implementation,The design is fairly good. The rotaing block could use a few modification to better hold the Measuring Cups.The knives are very cheap. A higher quality knife would improve this product imensly.
4,"If you're a true Dolby fan, you likely know this album well already.","The simple melodies, the multi-techno-instrumentation and the uncommon innovation and creativity of Thomas Dolby are the trademarks of his unique British style. Get past the over-played ""She Blinded Me.."" and you'll find ""Weightless"" which is an unavoidable Dobly melody with galactic gravitational pull."
3,"casseste over cd on album""golden age of wireless""","Just recently, ""The Golden Age Of Wireless"" by Thomas Dolby was just purchased by me not too long ago. When I listened to the cd, the cassette version played an extended version of ""She Blinded Me With Science"", which is not on the cd. I also had both versions of the cassettes which had both versions of ""Radio Silence"" techno and pop versions. However, the pop version was not on the cd. I like the cd, but if they were to reissue it, it should include the pop version of ""Radio Silence"" and the extended version of ""She Blinded Me With Science""."
4,A great album to own.,"Though Dolby's known as a one-hit-wonder for She Blinded Me With Science, after buying this album, I can't help but think of the whole thing as the hit. It's definitely a must-have for any fan of the music from that era.The only song I really miss, since I am not inclined to buy any of his other albums, is I Love You, Goodbye, and maybe Hyperactive. But the rest is all there, for me, at least."
5,a promise unfulfilled,"This (well, not quite this--I'll explain momentarily) is the best ""techno-rock"" record ever released, an intimation of what might have been--and wasn't--, like Neil Armstrong's moon walk, a cul de sac. There's some confusion below: Two vinyl versions of ""The Golden Age of Wireless"" were released in the United States, one preceding the hit single ""She Blinded Me With Science"", one succeeding it. The second vinyl version replaced ""Leipzig"" and ""Urges"" with ""She Blinded Me With Science"" and ""One of Our Submarines."" The remaining songs were remixed. (""Leipzig"" and ""Urges"" are now available on ""The Best of Thomas Dolby"".) The first vinyl version did not include something called ""The Wreck of the Fairchild"" or any instrumental cut, nor did it include, as I said and contrary to what someone else says below, ""One of Our Submarines"".Also recommended: Dolby's ""The Flat Earth"" and Jeff Burns's ""Pentatonic Scales for the Jazz Rock Keyboardist""."
1,terrible,"It smells like rubbing alcohol and just don`t work, it peels off of my skin. At first I was thinking that my skin is peeling off ,but than I realized that it was the sunscreen! I do not like it at all. I also red that it has one very bad ingredient!"
4,Beyond Beginner,"I bought this book for a college course to learn Access for work. I had tried to learn the program on my own only to find this book extremely helpful in understanding databases, queries, forms, and reports. I finished the book is about 2 weeks for a 4 month course! Do not buy this book if you want to learn customizing, macros, and VBA. This book is for beginners, but what I have found out (by ordering another book), is that the New Perspective series has to be the best there is at taking you step-by-step as to the process of creating within MS Office Programs. Buy reference books once you acquaint yourself with the programs. This book will take you to a beginner-intermediate status, and a reference book beyond that."
2,"For Begginers only, basic skills","The book is meant to be used in a course, as you read along in the book it constantly references ideas gone over in past chapters. I do not recommend this book for anyone looking to learn Access on their own, moreover anyone who is looking for an advanced book on Access programming & Features."
1,"Not a bad book, but data files are unavailable","The book is decent, but it's structured as a tutorial and the data files are no longer available. The book lists a web address for download of the files, but the link redirects to a different site. Acquisition of the original publisher, perhaps? Either way. a tutorial with no data is useless."
3,"Very general, useful, but not well edited","This book screams for the work of a good editor and another year of rewriting. It's not particularly well organized, and leaves the reader wondering about some incidents that could have been explored in greater depth, but were left inexplicibly blank. General Kennedy is understandably provented from discussing the nature of much of her career in Army Intelligence, but totally glosses over much of the human story.Having followed her career since being a cadet, a found this book a bit disappointing and could not help but wonder why someone of talent and intelligence allowed it to go to print with such obvious quality flaws.All of that said, Kennedy and her story are important, and the book is not tedious to read, and often times funny. Those who like her will still like her, and those who dislike her, did before they even picked up the book."
5,devotion to duty/the rise of a remarkable woman,"Generally Speaking is a book worth reading and should be read by every American. Claudia J. Kennedy devoted her adult life to the service of her country. The United States Army was her home. Her choices benefitted her career and her country. Generally Speaking leads you through the process. It is fascinating to read about a single woman rising through the ranks of the military successfully and yes, gracefully."
1,Very disappointed,"I looked forward to reading Gen Kennedy's memoirs with great anticipation, only to be very disappointed with its poor quality. Where do I begin? for starters, it seems like it was written by a 6th grader, with very short, truncated sentences that go nowhere. Second, it doesn't follow in a logical flow, bouncing from anecdotal stories about the Gen's life, to her own views on success and what it takes to make it in the world today. Very disjointed. Third, the story is just not there...nothing near what we've seen in Colin Powell's or Stormin' Norman's own memoirs...and I believe Gen Kennedy's story is just as important as their's. Very, very disappointed...hope her political ambitions are better thought out and executed."
2,WHATT??,I don't really like this when a boy can sing but sings lame poppy type sh*t but I like his song What--and the first time is alright
5,Comparisons to Kirsten Flagstad are preposterous!!!,"Deborah Voigt is the best famous dramatic soprano we have now. However, to compare her to Kirsten Flagstad is folly. She has neither Flagstad's enormous vocal volume or tonal beauty. Voigt sings musically on this CD and is mostly emotionally involved in what she is singing.I hear EMI is recording ""Tristan und Isolde"" as their last ever studio opera recording. Instead of using Swedish soprano Nina Stemme, they should use American Christine Brewer."
2,Isn't at all great,"It may be unfair to compare Deborah Voigt with the many great singers of the past. However, given that there are so many great performances available on record, one can only find this new recording to be not up to the challenge.In fact, Voigt is merely adequate for most of the time, and her voice is a bit too small for Wagner. Even her top notes aren't sufficiently powerful and free. Isn't really great."
1,Not the real thing,"Listening to this cd, I can't help feeling that many singers nowadays are taking on roles that don't suit them. Voigt isn't a real Straussian or Wagnerian soprano. Her voice lacks thrust and the top notes are far too thin to do the music justice. She just skims through her music without pay much attention to the text, which is also important in that repertoire.Given that there're infinitely better versions of these pieces in the record catalogues, this recording simply isn't a viable competitor."
1,Not the right voice,"Deborah Voigt does not have the right voice for this kind of repertoire. Her voice is too slim for that, and she doesn't yet have the right style of singing. Her renditions are very bland as a result, and there are moments of great strain. I think she should stick to the lighter repertoire which she excels."
2,Unsatisfactory,"Deborah Voigt does have a beautiful voice. However, a beautiful voice alone cannot do justice to the demanding music here. Voigt simply does not have the voice and expression for the Wagner roles, and her performances in the Strauss's excerpts are unwieldy."
4,"""Obsessions"" Worth Having","In a word, Deborah Voight's voice is dazzling. Strong, vibrant, expressive, ideally suited to the material suited on this CD. If you're a fan of the German operatic repertory and you haven't heard Voight -- what planet are you on? No, seriously, get this CD posthaste. My one gripe: If you're already a fan of Voights, you may have a lot of this material on other dics, mostly full-length opera recordings. The new material alone, however, is worth the price. (And it's definitely nice to have Deb's Greatest Hits all in one place!)"
1,Terrible,"This disc is representative of everything that is wrong with the classical music recording industry (the little that is left of it). Simply said, it does not come close to the legacies of the veritable artists we know so well. D. Voigt is by no means a remotely good singer, let alone someone with a voice resembling distinction. She is dull, unimaginative and monotonal. Grey. Unintelligent. And down from there. Do not believe the ads."
2,A poor substitute,So the Wagner and Strauss repertoire is now in the hands of singers like Voigt. Oh dear! Voigt is a poor substitute for those truly great singers of yester-years. This recording shows how limited her vocal and emotional ranges are.
1,Incompetent and inexpressive,"I do think that Deborah Voigt has a great personality. However, this isn't sufficient to make her a great singer. As can be patently heard from this new recording, her vocal quality is very so-so, and, more surprising, her top notes are very constricted and lacking in power, which is a lethal handicap for anyone who attempts this particular repertoire.Even more damaging is the inexpressive singing. Voigt seems to be using the same kind of emotion for all the tracks. One just can't discern from her singing alone what the characters are thinking and feeling. Such unimaginative, and even perfunctory, interpretation is just not enough.A disappointment."
1,Can't compare to Jane Eaglen,"I'm afraid Deborah Voigt has chosen the wrong repertoire, as she simply does not have the voice for these heavy Wagner and Strauss roles. Just listen to Jane Eaglen in the DVD of the Metropolitan Tristan and Isolde and you will realise that Eaglen is much better equipped for these type of roles.It is better for Voigt to be content with being the lady in waiting for Eaglen than to assume parts that are so obviously unsuitable for her."
1,Kabumpo is missing,"I have been wondering where this purches was. As it has never arrived from Amazon, I cannot very well review it. I am not worried, it's Amazon.I just assumed my order did not take. BB Rye, NY"
4,The Perfect Marriage of Orchestra and Jazz,"The is the first Miles Davis recording I owned. Since then I have become a great appreciator of the works he has compiled.Listening to Porgy & Bess is almost like listening to the score of a film. Each track projects to your mind's eye the story behind each song. For example, the song ""I Love You Porgy""paints vividly the cries of a woman being unwillingly torn from her lover. ""The Prayer"" shows the struggle of a person trying desperately to persevere through adversity. The albums highlight and one of the all-time favorite Miles Davis cuts, ""Summertime"" ignites your soul as soon as that first note cuts through your speakers. The album as a whole focuses more on the orchestra element than the jazz(i.e. Miles' trumpet)element. The album is without a centerpiece for a Miles Davis collection."
5,IS AMAZON KIDDING?,"The fact amazon.com doesn't list this album as an ""essential recording"" is someone's idea of a bad joke. This is some of Davis's finest work with Gil Evans. Absolutely perfect, absolutely essential."
5,I rock this,I rock this as loud as I can on the road to drown out the crappy gangster rap that I am subjected to by some of my fellow motorists. Sometimes I think they turn down their crap to listen to my Gold.Sometimes throwing your pearls in front of swine can pay off.
4,WHAT'S THE POINT?,"I always considered the EVANS-DAVIS collaboration an intellectual one and the COLTRANE-DAVIS collaboration an intuitive one.So naturally,apart from SKETCHES OF SPAIN i do not rave over their mutual recordings.What's the point of making a PORGY AND BESS record without the singing or the continuity?Where is I GOT PLENTY OF NOTHIN and why GONE ,an original not even composed by the GERSHWINS?For me,this is a rather unpleasant affair.I enjoyed it more from track 9 on.If you want to hear PORGY AND BESS ,but do not want to hear the complete work,try ELLA and LOUIS who gave us a near perfect sampler.I won't win new friends with my review,but as the man says,you've got to say what you think.I must admit that upon reading the other reviewers,i feel lonely."
2,Way too blue....,"I adore Miles Davis and also Gil Evans. They have played together very successfully, and the works featuring them together have become classics. However, I was disappointed with this CD. To play on Miles's ""Kind of Blue,"" I would like to say that this album is ""way too blue"". It is too slow, too dreamy, very rambling, and sometimes only the ghost of the melody can be heard. It put me to sleep. I was highly disappointed,"
4,Classy classic,"I'm not a P&B kind of guy but Davis's contribution to the overly-covered material still swings hard enough to stand out in earlier, less adventurous phases."
3,Lovely melodies,"While the melodies are lovely, and the music is well played, there is something missing from this recording. It doesn't quite reach the level of Gershwin's dramatic musicianship. Nice to listen to, but it would not be my first choice for this opera."
2,Too Much,"I guess that this CD was a might bit too much of Miles for me. I enjoyed ""Kind of Blue"" but not this one."
2,Quality not as good as I thought it would be,"I got this comoforter because I thought Nautica would be a good product, but I was wrong. The thread on it feel so rough, I don't even know how could I sleep with it. Returned the next day I got it. Also the color seem very cool on the picture, but when I got it, it is not the case! Beware"
5,Nice product,My daughter picked this for her room. It is well made and I like the coloring. We actually turned the bedspread upside down so the stripe on the black blocking goes across the pillows. It seemed more decorative to us that way.
4,AWESOME bargin!,this is an excellent buy. great value for money. you get a fast processer and good memory with lots of disk space. and a dvd player. if you're dont use your notebook for heavy applications then this is your baby! i totally love it. it's light and reliable.
3,A cracker barrel philosopher expounds his world view,"J. Danton Smith is an old-fashioned writer and that's meant as a compliment. His subjects are multitudinous and wide ranging; he seems willing to address every conceivable topic, from theology and physical science to sports and current events.""Memoirs of a Sleepless Mind"" held my attention throughout, although there were some sections I did not like. In his essays on the Bible, for example, Mr. Smith betrays a confirmed secularist's total misunderstanding of the sacred texts.Other parts of the book made me wish the author had devoted more space to those subjects he's better qualified to address, such as memory loss, metric time, and backgammon."
4,Good product for dry skin needing exfoliation,This is a little heavy for me but is excellent for drier skin types wanting a daily exfoliating treatment. The Glyderm Lotion is a better fit for me.
5,It works!,"This is a truely amazing record, moreso because of the fact that it can't help be compared to the dreadful ""3 Tenors"" sellout. The thing about this oh so special night in San Fran' is that it should be awful. Three massively talented musicians, no doubt egos bursting at the seams, come together on one stage.......we've seen it many times before and it almost always ends in an inevitable exercise in oneupmanship. This however is pure gold. Each note and phrase is there because it is needed. I still haven't figured it out but these three manage to defy both logic and statistics. There are very, very few records I would say this about but the world is a better place for it's existence."
5,Jaw Doppingly Fantastic,"Not only is this one of the most amazing technical shows of guitar skill I've ever heard, but it's also highly musical and exotic. You hear it straight from the first song. You hear the beautiful interplay between Paco and Al, and then it throttles you into one of these two sonofabitches solos, with an impecable rhythm backing it. And it goes on. And on. Throughout the whole album you are just amazed by the interplay between Paco and Al, John and Al, John and Paco, and all three of them together."
4,six hands that sound like 12.......,"Great playing.....I am a fan of McLaughlin and DiMeola. Try listening through a good pair of headphones. Somewhat amusing is when someone in the audience shouts out ""DIMEOLA "" and the audience shushes him."
5,Buy it now.,"It is impossible to describe how amazed I was when I first heard this CD. There is fire, feeling, heart, passion, virtuosity and even humor on this disc. The musicianship of these guitarists is pure and incredible. What is truly amazing is how the McLaughlin, DiMeola and De Lucia are able to blend together seamlessly, maintain their individuality and not step all over each other while playing.If you play guitar, buy this CD. Be warned, though. This CD will cause you to either want to practice a lot more or just throw your guitar away because you will never be this good.You will never hear a finer recording of acoustic guitars. Period.One final note: This is not background music. Listen to it intently with the volume turned up. It rocks."
4,Speedy guitarists,"Three of the best guitarists in the world team up to jam. They show off their individual abilities, and seem to be in a contest to determine which one can produce the fastest runs. I am floored by what each has trained himself to do on his instrument. But I am less than floored by the music they chose to play. Some of it sounds like it doesn't fit into what most people define as music. But I'm a guitar lover, and these men play the instrument as though they had been born with a guitar in their arms."
5,Speeeeeeeed,"This is incredibly fast. You're just kinda left in awe after listening to the first track alone.Some accuse Al, John, and Paco of playing without much feeling here, but I think they're wrong. This album burns... Mediterranean Sundance and Frevo Rasgado are my favorites."
2,this needs to be seen rather than heard,"3 phenomenal guitarists, all on acoustic, and all blazing away. In theory it sounds like it should make great listening but, in reality, without experiencing the excitement live by actually being there, this doesn't really work that well.The songs all sound too similar, the lightening fast riffs take a front seat to the actual melodies and you cannot discern who is playing (with the exception of Paco).If you get this because you want to hear virtuosos, then this is effective. If you want to hear good music, you should stick with the studio versions."
5,a new pop star,"This is the perfect album to play when you have a broken heart and a bottle of wine on a gloomy night or equally when you're driving with the top down on a sunny day. It lifts my spirits when I'm blue and is a great fun for singing along when all is right in the world. The lyrics will grab you... and they won't let go.Marianne Pillsbury is a new star on the pop star horizon but she's not a typical, manufactured flash-in-the-pan like so many of the latest pop singers. Mainly because she wrote the witty lyrics and catchy tunes to tell the stories we all know -not because we have heard them but because we have lived them."
2,Gallico sold out!,"Schlocky sequel...author admittedly penned this just to satisfy Filmmaker's lust for a movie version (which was an ultimate bomb, too). Not only is it a follow up to the film THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE (NOT to his excellent original book), but it's a bad one! Contrived silliness from such a talented writer...might have some appeal for diehard fans of the original movie."
2,Overpriced...........,"I'm a big fan of Ms. Ely's book, Saving Dinner, so I was very excited to find her study guide for kids. However, I was disappointed to open the box and find only 32 one-sided pages, loose with no binding at all. Of these, only 21 pages are worksheets and parent guides--the rest are a food diary! It's cleverly designed and kid-friendly, but not worth $8.95! In addition, the information is heavily weighted toward identifying carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Good info for kids, but I was hoping to steer my picky eater toward fruits and veggies and there was little information on the their benefits."
5,An Incredible Read!!,"This book was absolutely one of the best novels of suspense I have ever read, and believe me, I am a heck of a reader. I bought the paperback so I just finished it.I personally went to the A.J. Zerries' (husband/wife authors) website and sent them an email of approval for a story that imprisoned me as a page turner from the 1st page. They were kind enough to respond. Great information on Art Theft during WWII. Read carefully, because the passage of time between chapters can be weeks or even months.It truly deserves a screen writer.. Could the director be Spielberg??"
3,"So many characters, convoluted",This book has an engaging storyline and a few really well built characters but it also has about a million sub characters. They muddle the story and make it confusing. Sometimes it felt like no one had edited this book because there were so many nonessential characters. The authors added a ton of detail to every mini character which just watered down the entire story. It was hard to tell which characters we important and which were just side liners.
4,A page turner,I love novels on art and art theft. This is right up there with the other good ones. I hope Zerries writes more.
1,Great Premise Overblown Writing,This story has an incredible premise. The plot line is phenomenal. The problem with it is that the writing is verbose and overblown. If it had been well edited it would have been a page turner. As it is now after wading through the overdone verbiage to an unsatisfactory conclusion I wanted to fling the book when I finished it. In fact if the premise had not been so good I might very well not have finished reading it at all. Some of the situations seemed a bit far fetched as they do in Dan Brown novels but Dan Brown makes the suspense of belief more palatable.
3,"Dreary, confoluted, unchallenging","This book is dreary, convoluted and fails to challenge the reader. It seems to be going do where very slowly. It's not worth the money."
3,Good premise for story-could have been better,"The premise of a Nazi-plundered Van Gogh from Paris in 1944 and its dramatic reappearance in NYC 60 years later is a very compelling story line and what drew me to purchase this book. I enjoyed reading it, but the plot line became a bit too unrealistic for me about 75% of the way through the book. I finished the book and enjoyed it, but it was not the best thriller I have read-hence the 3 star rating."
3,The Lost Van Gogh,"Story line was good, interesting, well woven and visual. I enjoyed the story very much, even the open ended potential romance. My one and only complaint was the EDITING! Oh, my word! Someone... was not careful. I counted several obvious mistakes. It sadly takes away from the joy of reading when one finds one needs a red pen."
4,An entertaining read,It wasn't a page burner but it was always easy to pick up. I would have preferred more character development but the history portrayed was very compelling. It's was a little bit Michener meeting Brown.
4,The Lost Van Gogh,This was a good reading material that was very entertaining too. It was very captivating with a lot of tense moments to me.
3,The Last Van Gogh,Actually I was somewhat surprised by this book. I have not yet completed that is reason for 4 star rating. I am about 75% done and so far it is quite enjoyable. The only thing I have found fault with is the main character agonizing over wife's death way too much!! Other than that very interesting.
3,Not bad,"Used for reference, this book is helpful to technical spinners. But for a beginner, it's pretty worthless because it isn't really designed to teach. Definitely not a how-to book."
4,ABBA Review,I think this is a good CD. My first reason why is I like their songs and lyrics such as Mama Mia. Their songs don't give you a head ache either. They sing nice and smooth.Though some songs sound old the margarity is like dance music and catchy phrases.
5,A Great Pond Pump,"After having this same Rio 26HF pump for a few years of 24/7 use, it would not restart after a power outage. I ordered this again because it has been a very good pump. I love the fact that Amazon gives me the option of free shipping, or in this case, fast shipping for a fair price. It has great flow for a Koi pond. You just need to size the pump for the number of gallons in your pond. For a Koi pond, if you want to keep the water clear, you will need a higher flow rate pump like this one."
5,Every day comfort,"these earrings are ideal for every day and all night wear. I have very senstive skin,(i.e. rashes from anything less than 14K gold to rashes from clothing tags) I wear these earrings daily(I sleep in them too) in fact, they do not come out unless I am going somewhere fancy and need to switch to something flashier."
2,14k endless hoop earrings,"I purchased these earrings as replacements for an earring I lost. The size is OK (difficult to determine on-line) the actual diameter of the tube is much finer than expected. I wear these 24/7 as I did my original set and have had them for about a week. The earrings are changing color - they look stained - kind of redish which 14k gold should not do unless subjected to something like iodine. These earring have had nothing but shampoo and water touch them. I will most likely be returning them.I contacted Earrings Direct and was told they could do nothing for me even though the issue is defective product related. They told me to ""polish them"". Do not use this firm - they have very poor customer service."
3,As described but closure is not secure,"I was very happy with this product in terms of size, color & quality all being as described. I was looking for a pair of earrings to wear day in and day out, without poking me while sleeping. These earrings serve that function well with 1 exception: they come out too easily! I would say the prong that extends into the closure needs to be longer.I have pulled out one earring by mistake on 2 separate occasions with 2 weeks: once while removing a shirt over my head, and once while pushing my hair behind my ear. Unfortunately with earrings that come out this easily, they can't serve as every day wear."
2,You get what you pay for!,"I gave these 2 stars because they do manage to cut, however they discolored/stained the first time I put them in the dishwasher, very lightweight. The carousel is pretty flimsy also. Save your money and invest in a quality knife set!"
1,Cheap Set,I could of brought a better set in Big Lots. Knives rusted after first wash. Carousel is flimsy.
1,"Looks Great, Works Great, and RUSTS!!!!","Bought this and loved the fact that it was ""dishwasher safe,"" and believed because it was Farberware it was a good product. After four months of use, all the knives have little dots of rust appearing. DO NOT BUY THIS SET!!!"
5,Ahhhmazing,"Came in the mail way sooner than expected, perfect timing for mothers day, beautiful bracelet and for the price I wouldn't dare complain, I would recommend this to any jewelry lover, great small gift, I WILL PURCHASE FROM THIS DEALER AGAIN! =)"
5,Was skeptical at first...but found out how to use it and it is GREAT,"At first, when I got this band, I was confused as how to put it on.But when I realized how to do this, I fell in love with the band.For all those who bought this band and are unsure as how to use it,I would try to explain it to you.When you get the band, and you stretch it you would see that it has a kind of curved metal on one end that you have to place on the other end of the bracelet. Don't stretch the bracelet.Get a pin and pull out the metal part and try to place the curved part into the space on the other side of the link of the bracelet and you would see that the band is now perfectly round."
1,Starter Bracelet P.O.S.,I bought this thinking I was getting a fantastic price for what looked like a beautiful piece of jewelry. Lies. The price you pay is what you get. The metal was very hard and it hurt to wear. It pinched my skin and was very uncomfortable. I ended up not wearing it and bought a different one on Amazon for $5-- spend a few more dollars. It's worth it! I would not recommend this product.
5,Bigger is better,"Have a Ural, Gear-Up motorcycle with a sidecar and needed some type of handguard to keep the wind off my hands and help keep my hands warm. And, a little off road protection is a bonus. The Moose Large Handguards were the largest guards I could find, they fit and work Great !"
5,What a great story and movie!,"How funny! We rented this recently because we had just ordered the musical also adapted from the same play (which is also excellent, by the way). We couldn't stop laughing! The plot just kept getting thicker and thicker as the princess sunk deeper and deeper into these webs she was spinning, and the reactions of everyone around her just made for a very good story. The acting in this is superb by all involved. Ben Kingsley, as always, was brilliant, and I've never liked Fiona Shaw more! Sorvino was a new one for me, but she too did a wonderful job.This movie does have the feel of a stage play, in the way it's filmed and the clips and angles chosen, but I do not think that it detracts from the film at all. On the contrary, it's nice to see a recent film made in this fashion - few films do a play justice anymore.Highly recommend!"
5,DVD Review of THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"If you enjoy period-piece costume movies, give this puppy a try. Mira Sorvino OWNS this movie. Dressed as a man, with her female companion also dressed as a man, they break into a wealthy estate. Mira proceeds to seduce everyone she encounters inside, male and female, either with promises of love or with gold coins for the servants. When caught in a lie, she then proceeds to tell a more outrageous deception. Everyone in the movie is at the absolute top of their game. When I wasn't smiling, I was laughing out loud, or going back to see a favorite scene again. And again. Even ""The Movie"" is having fun: it breaks fourth-wall a few times in a way I hadn't seen before. @hg47"
1,Don't waste your money on this.,"I ordered this toy for my 3 yrs old son.I just got this toy, and totally shocked by how poorly this toy made.The description says it's made by WOOD, but all I could see was very sharp edged PLASTIC and already peeled vynil stickers on top.I sent a message to this seller about this issue, and didn't hear from them anything. Don't waste your money and time on this piece of junk."
2,helf,"please helf.I have kodak z885. i take good pictures, but when my digital camera dont switch on....I have this 4 week."
4,Northern Wis review,"This camera is very easy to use. It is the first digital camera I have own. I like the features where you can edit your pictures if they are not exactly what you want. Also the different settings for taking pictures in snow, with candles etc. very nice features."
5,This camera is Great,"If you choose this camera go ahead and shell out the bucks for an SD card and the dock.I've never been crazy about the easy share software but it works best to get the pictures from the camera to the computer.In the fully automatic mode taking great pictures is a no brainer, as for the more advanced stuff , it will do a time exposure of up to 8 seconds which makes it usable for some astronomy photos. I photographed the last lunar eclipse and just for kicks, the Orion constellation.as for the video mode, at 640x480 you can get some pretty good stills from your videos.I would prefer videos that were in Windows media format, but the quality is great.This is the best digital camera before you move up to the next price range"
2,battery drainer,"I like this camera better than our old Kodak DX. It's smaller and faster. I like that the on/off is a separate button. With the DX, I have to go from auto mode to off to video mode. What I don't like about the Z885 is that it eats up batteries like crazy. I like taking pictures and videos of my kids. Many times, I miss the precious moments because the battery had drained."
2,no wrist strap!,I purchased this camera after my Sony of 4 years blew up. It does not compare in quality to my previous camera. The pictures taken inside were blurry and red-eyed. The colors in the NC mountains last week-end were vibrant! Too bad the camera didn't come close to capturing them. And-- WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH NO CARRYING STRAP!?? There's a place for one- but it is not provided- maybe it's considered an accessory along with the view finder-also not included. We'll probably end up buying another Sony and giving this to our teenager.
2,Downlaoding pics to the computer - complicated,"The quality of the pics wasnt impressive at all....but downloading them to the computer was worse....it wasnt as friendly as with the previous cameras I used to have, Canon and Fuji. I would need to buy the dock to make d/l to pc easy, they at least should have sold it as an enissial accessory with the camera, included in the price."
4,Kodak Z885,"I really love my new camera. I haven't had time to figure out all the quirks, but here goes:Good: Optical Zoom, Video recording, manual settings, can change pixel size, small, light weight, easy to useBad: Cannot zoom when recording video, hard to capture moving objects in low light (concerts), software is very slow, must use software to load pictures from camera"
3,Very Picky about Batteries,"I use rechargeable batteries with this camera and I have to recharge them right before I use them on this camera every single time. I thought I just had crappy rechargeable batteries but I tried different brands and I get the same result. If I use batteries I charged 3 days ago it wouldn't work. It probably has something to do with Rechargeable batteries having 1.25V as opposed to Alkaline batteries having 1.5V. When I use Alkaline batteries, I have no problem. The Pictures come out great though... when it works."
2,Chacun a son gout...,"I suggest anyone not familiar with this conductor preview the recording at a library if possible. I have enjoyed other period ensembles--not this one. I have no problem with the quick tempo, but to me the dynamics seemed arbitrary in their extreme contrasts. Perhaps I simply prefer a more lyrical approach. The principal singers have a nasal tone quality that greatly annoyed me. I have heard at least one of them live sounding quite different, so I assume it was the conductor's decision that the singers sound more like oboes than human beings. I did enjoy the comic ensemble numbers (for example, ""sua madre..). However, I missed the sense of emotional characterization in the major arias and recitatives that the other reviewers have praised. To me, this is an artificial and lifeless presentation."
5,Rugged,"Bought this for my son. He had been looking everywhere but couldn't find what he wanted. He loves this case. It is very rugged, sturdy and it looks great! Very well made."
4,"Dated songs, but still a good instruction book.","This book is the last in the series of six Alfreds Basic Guitar Method Books. The songs are very dated. Possibly because most of these songs are in the public domain and the publisher does not have to pay any copyright fees. At any rate this book teaches songs in the first through seventh position. If you memorize the Phrygian mode box scale it will be easy to finish this book. All the position scales in this book are done in this mode and illustrated. However the name of the scale is not given, as it should be. In my opinion the biggest problem is that this book does not outline ALL the modes in the different keys.This is however a good book to learn sight reading in different positions."
5,A showcase of Curve's best work,"Back in the era of ""shoegazing"" (late 80's, early 90's), when Brit bands such as My Bloody Valentine and Ride ruled the alternative landscape, there was another band that kicked serious... Curve. Fronted by Toni Haliday, Curve showcased her dreamy, yet occasionally menacing vocal style. She was the sort of starlet who could carry the band - kind of a precursor to Shirley Manson, the face behind Garbage. But the early iterations of Curve were less about the vocals, and more about the smorgasbord of sounds permeating through each track. Swirling, howling guitars intersect with the drum machines and traces of electronica to create sounds that cannot be classified as being dance music or mood music or whatever. Ten Little Girls, Blindfold, Frozen, and Clipped are the stellar tracks.Public Fruit is a collection of Curve's first 3 EPs. Public Fruit stands out, along side My Bloody Valentine's Loveless and Isn't Anything, as being a seminal CD from a long-gone era."
4,some excellent stuff,Some of these tracks are Curve's very best. The extended remix of Fait Accompli is excellent.
2,Disappointing,"Rather disappointing CD, with either plain orchestrations, or simply bad ones.I find extraordinary that Nelson Riddle should always be so incredibly talented with arrangements for singers (Sinatra, Nat King Cole, Ella Fitzgerald), and so mediocre with orchestra-only music!"
4,In The Beginning...,"All the acclaim and legend surrounding this collection is true, and anyone who is interested in American music really should start here.A word of caution to the uninitiated, though: Robert Johnson did not play the electric blues which are the staple of modern American blues and the roots of Rock n Roll. This is acoustic blues music, solo vocal with (incredible) acoustic guitar accompaniment. It is amazing, amazing stuff--just try to duplicate the guitar parts and you'll understand what a master Johnson was--but don't be looking for rockin' rhythm sections or the big bass sound of later bluesmen."
2,This Does NOT Contain The Missing Song,"A reviewer below has made a mistake, or his review was misfiled: This compilation is not to be confused with ""King of the Delta Blues SINGERS."" THAT is the compilation which contains the alternate take of ""Traveling Riverside Blues."" It and its companion, ""King of the Delta Blues Singers, Volume 2"" also have much better mastering than any other Robert Johnson collections that I am aware of. Unfortunately, between them, ten alternate takes have yet to be upgraded from either mastering of the ""Complete"" collection.I have not heard ""King of the Delta Blues""--I am basing this information on the song sample Amazon has provided. But given the song lineup, this is a confusingly unnecessary product."
5,Excellent collection of The Blues,This man influenced so many even though was life was cut so short. Everyone from Eric Clapton to Led Zeppelin have been influenced by Robert Johnson's work.
4,Pretty good single disc collection,"If you must buy a single disc Robert Johnson collection, and not opt for The Complete Recordings, then this is the one to get. This CD is superior to The King of the Delta Blues Singers. Don't be fooled by the similar titles. This one has a much better song selection than the other, containing more of Johnson's most famous classics. It would still be better to get The Complete Recordings which contains all of Johnson's 29 recorded songs plus alternate takes, but this CD is the best single disc collection of Robert Johnson's music currently available."
2,Might be great...but who can tell?,"This cd needs to be remastered remastered remastered. Reviews of future cds by RJ also mention this ""great improvement after remastering."" We have a fabulous audio system but this cd (and maybe in all fairness this particular disk) is horrific. I broke it/tossed it."
2,not bad for what it is,So he sang some simple blues songs and played his simple guitar licks and died young. And thus begins the pattern that if you die young your importance and talent become magnified far beyond what it would have been had he lived another 20 years and drank himself into obscurity. Forget the hype and get real.
4,Wonderful fingerstyle guitar,"Etta Baker is such a lovely lady who is one of the leading practioners of the Piedmont blues guitar. This, one of the wonderful albums issued in conjunction with the Music Maker Foundation, showcases her fluid picking. The lack of vocals is the only complaint about this release. Otherwise this showcases of her fluid finer picking on a variety of tunes shows why Etta Baker is so highly regarded by fans of acoustic blues."
5,Ballads: Kim Richmond,"We are very pleased with the CD. Kim Richmond was recently in Tucson and we were priviledged to meet and hear him play.Thank you,Lois J. Carter"
3,Save your money!,"Needless to say I love Myron Cohen's work but this DVD is a low budget spinoff of an HBO show. Way, way overpriced,something you'd find on a rack in 7-11 or Safeway. Content OK one that misses the true Myron Cohen, this comes off as a quicky, ""cautious"" in and out gig."
5,Fantastic!,"I have been a fan of T&P for over 20 years and was even fortunate enough to do a vocal workshop with Patti. Not only are T&P incredibly gifted musicians, they are also 'real' people. In their music and through their lives, they walk their talk. Love is the key and it does take your breath away! This album nestles right in there with their previous ones - impeccably executed and filled with the warmth of Patti's voice and Tuck's heartfelt dexterity. Both have enviable chops but only use those skills to enhance the music and the lyrics, never just to show off. Put on the headphones, close your eyes and be embraced by the love T&P share with the world."
2,Was not happy,"The color and everything worked great. It did however take a little longer then normal to dry. Also it was so fragile, rubbing it continuesly would wear it away also wiping with alchol. I even put tape on it to mask off certian areas after a day of drying and you can see the color on the sticky side when I removed the tape. I was spraying bare metal and ended up useing a clear coat to protect the color.I was not too satisfied."
1,Bad,"Bad paint for foam,it spits and made a mess of my RC plane ,also it rubs off when worked on.even allowing to dry for three days. BILL SCHALLER"
3,"Not their Best""","This is one of those albums that was in between a great one and a developing one. The first 4 records are the standouts, but after that the music goes into a sleeper. That's ok though, because once you get past this one, there would be great things to come."
3,just okay,"This is some of their earlier work. The CD is just okay to me. The only stand out in my opinion is the Ballad ""I need you so"" My mom used to play this one day and night. It was the B side to freedom which is a hip hop classic."
4,A good novel of a major cavalry-Indian engagement,"The Battle of the Rosebud is the subject of this historical fiction work and is an excellent account of an engagement that never received its due as a military conflict of major import in the history of the west. The Custer fight, which occured eight days later, has always arrested the attention of historians and military scholars because of the magic of the Custer name, but the determined fighting by the Indians at the Rosebud and General George Crook's return to Fort Fetterman disrupted the grand design by the army to put and end to Indian resistance for all time. The War Department's plan to have three military columns converge on the Indians and defeat them failed in large part due to the tactical defeat of the army by the Indians at the Rosebud and played no small part in what happened on the Little Big Horn on June 25th. Terry C. Johnston takes his readers through the planning, the marching and the desperate fighting that took place that day."
3,Not as useful as I had hoped.,"I had some time off work and really wanted to develop my penmanship. I've always had terrible handwriting and with Christmas cards going out soon, I wanted to add a nice personal touch. Unfortunately, this book didn't deliver. The author gives you plenty of case studies with before and after handwriting samples, but only briefly mentions how she worked with the person to achieve the results. There is very little in the way of exercises for you to do yourself.If there were more exercises I would be unhappy with the size of the book, as a pocket sized guide is hard to work out of, but there was precious little to work on."
4,Bill Joe,"Billy Joe Jr. is a great guitarist. Started out doing studio work and plays with and studied with Chet Atkins. Great licks. Well worth discovering. I've talked with his Dad, nice people."
3,Pretty Well Done!!!!!!!!,"I think this is a cool smooth jazz disc.Luis is a great song.This guy does a song called Carribean Magic, that I am yet to find.Angel's Dance is a good song for any occasion.Indian Summer is intresting as well.Check it out music friend's."
5,Very pleasant backround music,"Must have if you enjoy warm, full guitar sounds to relax by. The album puts you in mind of the warm gulf breezes on a sunny sping day."
1,disappointeed,"I have been buying outer banks shirts for at least ten years,but apparently there is no longer any quality control.I purchesd five shirts(2108)and none of the five was the same.They all had sleeve problems,either being too long or too tight."
2,Cheaply made.,"This stand isn't all that great. The picture on the box makes one think that the Xbox 360 somehow hooks onto it, but instead it's just sitting on it. That's not very secure, so this thing won't stop your Xbox from falling over. Also, the game storage doesn't allow for larger-than-normal cases; if you have the limited edition of Perfect Dark Zero, it doesn't fit in the game storage. Other than that, if you want somewhere to put your games and your Xbox, this works."
1,Not a great idea...,The Xbox360 needs as much airflow around it as it can get. It's not wise to stack games right next to it and block the side vents. It looks pretty but is probably best to avoid this stand.
2,seems rushed,"bought this when i first got my 360, thinking like the previous reviewer, that it would somehow ""hook"" to this stand for added stability. such is not the case.my 360 is loud, but never gets super warm, even with the games along its sides. still, its a good point brought up.what annoys me the most however is that even with normal sized cases, even sliding them in carefully, it peels the clear plastic outside off the bottom edge of the cases, which is highly annoying, especially since i like to cycle games im playing through the stand. so now some games have a big plastic fold at the bottom, which not only looks crappy, prevents a nice alignment of cases.overall, its really a waste of time and money, at any price."
5,Excellent and engrossing,"Couldn't put it down. It's been awhile (probably since the last Michael Nava book!) since I've been so completely wrapped-up in a book. Many layers to the plot of this book, and once I started to realize what was going on, it was impossible to stop reading. I'll take Michael Nava over John Grisham any day."
4,A Good Read,"I have read a few of Michael Nava's books now and have enjoyed them all. Nava writes stories that are captivating and pull the reader in. In The Burning Plain, he pulls in many political issues and deals with them well. I enjoyed this book - it is not great, but it is a step above your average gay fiction."
5,Not an expert,"Read my review of ""Death of Friends"". Michael Nava is a superb storyteller. Please read all his books in the order of publications, and follow the main character from the first book to the last. I hope Mr. Nava writes more books. In my opinion, he is a literary artist!"
3,Not My Cup of Tea,"I had no idea who this author was before I pick up this book off the sale rack. Although this book was ok, I do not think I will read another of his works. I am not a big fan of this type of neither mystery nor reading books with a focus of social issue ground breaking."
1,The DVD version of Moon 44 is a big let down,"When I first heard that this title was coming out on DVD I was rather excited because I had only ever seen the film on VHS in a pan and scan format. I remember liking the movie and looked forward to the day when it would come out on DVD because I assumed it would be released in widescreen format. Much to my dismay the DVD version is another pan and scan transfer. Here was an opportunity to release the title with it's original Panavision, 2.35:1 aspect ratio but for some odd reason the distributors bypassed this option in favor of the old VHS pan and scan format. The movie is fun but far from a great film. But if a widescreen version was available I would definitely buy it. But a new DVD version in pan and scan seems like a waste of time to me. So I'll just pass on this one and hold on to my old VHS copy."
2,Red Alert!Red Alert! Bad Movie Dead Ahead!,"Just when I though Roland Emmerich couldn't get any dumber, I saw Moon 44, his first movie, and proved myself wrong.I liked the Idea Moon 44 had behind it, and I'm a big Michael Pare fan, but this, ick. Some awsome matte shots are surrounded by cheesy, cheap, and bad effects. The plot is dismal, depressing, and somewhat obvious, etc. The music is good, and the acting is generally good (Thats the only reason it got 2 stars), and there are a few points in the movie where you actually care about the people, but thats overshadowed by the crap that makes up the rest of the movie. The only possible way I can see to make this movie better is to release a Widescreen release of it ( That might by marginally bearible. Avoid this movie at all costs, unless your desperate."
1,Information is incorrect,"I read the book and found there to be information that was wrong. I could not use the links in the back that were offered as they did not reach anything. Also, I find it nauseating that the author would write, ""Jennifer Lewis is available for individual personal support related to endometriosis. Fees are negotiable."" I was stunned to say the least!!! First of all, if the author is not a social worker, psychologist, etc., how can she charge for this type of service. Secondly, if she really wants to help someone, why would she charge for this????The book was bad enough that it did not have correct information, but to add that she will offer support and FEES ARE NEGOTIABLE???? That was the straw that broke the camel's back, so to speak!"
5,WITHOUT A DOUBT- THE BEST OUT THERE ON ENDO!!!!!,"I PROMISE YOU THAT IF YOU ARE SUFFERING FROM ENDOMETRIOSIS, THAT THIS BOOK WILL BE YOUR BEST FRIEND!!!!! JENNIFER SPEAKS FROM THE HEART AND GIVES A HUMAN AND VERY PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE TO THE PLIGHT OF THIS MEDICAL CONDITION. THANK YOU FOR SHARING YOUR PAIN IN ORDER TO HELP OTHERS OVERCOME THEIR'S!!! YOU ARE TRULY AN INSPIRATION."
5,Just what I needed - perfect!,"Thank you for writing the truth about this disease and how much it impacts a woman's life. I feel more validated and I plan on showing your book to my friends and family as soon as possible. They need to understand what it's really like to go through the things related to the endo and I can't explain them well but this book does an excellent job of doing that! I am also going to bring it into my doctor's office and have her answer the questions you listed about surgery before my upcoming surgery next month. I appreciate this book more than anything.Also, thank you for taking the time to e-mail me back. I wrote to 5 sites and you are the only one who cared enough to write me back. Thank you!Marie P."
1,Counting All the Mistakes in this Book Exhausted Me!,"If you want to learn about endometriosis, skip this book. It's devoid of factual information. Instead, the author has made up her own terminology, created her own theories, misinterpreted research findings, and added a brand new staging category for the bewilderment of her readers! Her experience is also extremely unique. She says she had a hard time convincing her physicians she needed a hysterectomy. However, as a woman with this disease, my experience has been quite the opposite -- most doctors are more than willing to suggest (and sometimes push)hysterectomy, even with young women. It has been a struggle for me to convince them I'd like to keep my organs, thank you very much. However, this book is overwhelmingly pro-hysterectomy. That, coupled with the blatant errors, really turned me off."
5,Best book on endometriosis for REAL women! TRUTH!,"Thank you, Jennifer Lewis! When your book fell into my hands I was about ready to give up. No one had ever been straight with me, maybe because they did not know or because they just thought it was not important enough. For the first time I feel validated in my depression, pain, symptoms and especially how this disease has affected my marriage of 18 years. I have hope for my future. I had my husband read your chapter for men and since then things have been so much better. We are learning to use your communication tools and they are working! We actualy TALK about this now as he says he was afraid of it, now he isn't. I am so grateful. A MUST for anyone with endo. Especially those with family or friends that NEED information.Elisabeth"
5,"Excellent, informative, emotional & wonderful book","I can not say enough about how this book has helped people in my life. It does more than give you information about endo, it is an emotional support that woman afflicted with this disease needs. It also goes one step further which no other book on endo has done & that is gives a male perspective. This section has helped my husband & sons understand what it is I've gone through & still have to fight. This is an absolute life saver. Thank you Jennifer!!!"
5,I urge all my patients with endometriosis to read this book,"I am a RE who specializes in endometriosis. A patient of mine turned me on to this book and I bought several copies for my office after reading it. I highly rec. this to anyone with endometriosis or anyone who may think they have it. Ms. Lewis allows us to see much more than what this disease is but how important support and mutual regard is in a doctor-patient relationship. It is well written, easy to understand and a great source of validation and encouragement to my patients who have read it. I have actually incorporated some of her suggestions into my daily interaction with patients. Jennifer Lewis is right on target when she talks about what the disease can do to a woman both physically and psychologically. No other book on endometriosis is as bold or straight forward and honest. An outstanding publication. M.A. Lee, MD, F.A.C.O.G."
5,Best info on endo in a way we can all relate to!,This book helped me realize I was not alone and I felt like I was reading about me!! It is very patient friendly with a ton of important info to offer. You can also find out about other women around the world.
1,Found the book to have some inconsistencies and misinformati,"I found there to be misinformation in that the author states there are FIVE stages of endometriosis, when in fact, to date, there are only FOUR, and there were only four at the time this book was published. Also, the online resources at the back of the book are incorrect, and do not lead to anywhere."
1,Hated the book,This book put me into such a state of depression after I read it!!!! I felt as if my life was going to be a nightmere for the rest of my life. This was not something I wanted to read after just being diagnosed with endometriosis. The author fails to give to anyone hope or help in dealing with the disease. I would never reccomend this book to anyone as I woud hate to see anyone feel the way I did after reading it.
5,The only book on Endo I recommend!,"I am the husband of a wonderful woman with this horrifying disease and it is all I can do not to shout rave reviews about Ms. Lewis's encouraging, helpful, hopeful and most informative guide to living with endometriosis. She explains exactly what it's like for those of us who have to stand by and watch our loved ones suffer and for that I applaud her. A must have for every individual not only with the disease but for those who love someone with it."
4,Really Empowerng for Women!!,My mother bought it for me after she saw her doctor who had it. He told her it might help me and her with all our quetions. I am on my third lap and felt so alone until I read Ms. Lewis's book. I feel a lot of hope and I recommend it to anyone with this horrible disease. She makes you feel like she is writing about you!!( in my case!)Also it is very easy to understand. MJ
1,Looks Are Deceiving,"Although it seems like it would be the perfect iron for smoothing and curling, it doesn't work. The edges of the plate cause creases in the hair regardless of how you move and place it."
1,Wrong product received,Shipment was 3 weeks late and when received it was the wrong Salt water test kit. It was a test kit cheaper than what I had paid for. I ordered the red sea test kit and instead I got an API test kit.
1,Do not buy this FACSIMILE edition!,"This book arrived yesterday, ""this book"" being the ""FACSIMILE edition"" of the second edition. It's terrible. The reproduction isn't even as good as photocopying. The quality is so poor the illustrations are almost worthless: so dark no detail can be seen or so light little is left to see at all. This certainly vitiates its use for art instruction. Pages are out of alignment. There are supposed to be color plates, but they aren't reproduced at all, which means that this isn't even a complete facsimile of the original, and Amazon and the publisher should be charged with false advertizing. There is no indication of its facsimile nature in the book itself. So: Don't buy this book (especially at $55.60!); instead, look for a used copy."
4,Very detailed but be warned about picture quality,"Very good descriptions and instructions. But watch the picture quality and the packaging. It is nearly exactly like your instructor went out and just mass-photocopied it for the class. The cover is flimsy and rips easily, and the picture qualities inside tend to look very photocopied as well. But it shouldn't matter if all you are after is the quality content."
5,"Small, concise, helpful.","I bought this book for my 18 year old brother after his best friend died tragically. I left it in his room, feeling it would be awkward to give it to him directly. He was 'too tough' to cry at that point. A few days later my mom told me that there was an empty tissue box by his bed, the tissues used and crumpled around it. A corner of the book stuck out from under his mattress. I didn't read the entire book myself- I looked through parts of it before buying it. Some pages featured a simple quote or a short paragraph. Others were filled with words from teens who had experienced similar loss. I was pleased that the book itself was not only small in size, but that each page contained just enough material for a grieving teen to digest without being overwhelming. This book allowed my brother to, at least temporarily, take off his mask of bravery and simply cry over the loss of his friend. That deserves five stars from me."
4,Great introduction and guidebook,"I found this book to be very helpful in introducing the emerging world of WAP not just in technical terms, but in the significant and interesting paradigm differences between the wireless market and the established wired web marketplace. As one of the first books on the subject in a field that is very rapidly evolving, there exists the very likely possibility that the information becomes outdated quickly. Apparently mindful of this, the book steers clear from too many 'absolutes' and focuses instead on general 'how to do this' and 'follow this lead' sorts of examples. Very easy reading and clear writing style. Never condescending or elitist, a no-nonsense book for professionals written without pretense. Get this book, get the referenced standards and SDK materials and keep an eye out for updates to the state of the art, and you will have gotten a good primer on developing for this arena."
5,Surprisingly Accessible Recipes,"This cookbook contains many of the most popular dishes served at the Inn at Little Washington. I was surprised how true the recipes are to the dishes served at the Inn. Few recipes require exotic or inaccessibly expensive ingredients. While some recipes are labor-intensive, others can be prepared rather quickly and easily with excellent results, such as the Rockfish with Mushrooms and Grapes.The Red Pepper Soup with Sambuca Cream has become a favorite in our house, even among those who typically do not enjoy red pepper. The Medallions of Veal with Calvados Cream is also well worth the effort. The ice-cream recipes in this text are also excellent.If you are not an avid cook, this book has lovely pictures and makes for a good coffee table book. The text is also well-written and interesting. Highly recommended."
5,great recipes,"This book was bought to accompany Refined American Cuisine, by Patrick O'Connell. It was just like I thought it would be. Full of beautiful photos and recipes."
2,Beautiful book,Beautuful coffee table book. Beautiful pictures. The recipes were not very practical for everyday use. Would be helpful to a gourmet cook or professional.
4,Filter,This filter is a great replacement and a heck of alot cheaper than the factory filter and $80.00 to install it when all you have to do is open the glove compartment remove the protective guard slip out the old and slide in the new. Also if the idiot light comes on all you have to do is press and hold either the Auto Off or the climate button. Isn't it good being old you forget everything.
4,SUZANNE MAYER not meyer delivers great romantic suspense,"Linda Miller guaranteed a life sentence for a mobster boss is she lived long enough to testify as to the murder of a US Senator. Michael Rosen found his assignment challenging both for theexternal dangers of the mob and the proximity of Linda Miller'scompeting attitude. Soon both realized that there was more to the game then hoping traditional friends could be trusted. Mystery, teasing events, sarcastic dialogue, action adventure, and romance."
2,Lonewolfs vs. Badguys,"Strussel and Sly in the same movie... hmm what to say, the first 60 minutes of this movie are actually very good. The story unfolds at a good speed, youre not sure whats going to happen and that makes it interesting. Unfortunatly everything that they have bilt up is more or less destroyed by a... well, Iam not really going to tell you and spoil everything, but you will see what I meen. Iam not saying this movie is rubish, just that it is not very original, my point is: who among us has not yet seen a movie with a lonewolf cop(in this case two) and a badguy. All in all it is entertaining movie and has its share of action, maybe on a Friday after work, just to relax.Replay value: Medium"
5,Awsome Movie,I saw this movie alot when I was younger. Me and my friends watched it twice a day. The action in this movie is superb. This is the movie that originated the word F.U.B.A.R. It has continous action. Teri hatcher is in this movie and plays a very attractive stripper. I would buy this movie right away. I'm happy it finale came out on DVD.
4,Stalone and Russel Make Great Buddy-Buddy Team,"A new spin on the old ""good cop, bad cop"" ruitine where both are ""good cops"" but ones a cop in it for the publicity, Stallone, a cop/invester, and the other for the thril, Russell, a slob who loves his job a little too much. But when both collide on the same phoney tip, there put in the slammer for a murder the didn't committ. A great break-out scene and one of the greatest vehicles ever created for an 80's car chase."
4,I miss the 80's,"I bought this dvd for christmas and watched it for the first time in a while. Kurt Russell steals the show from his partner and if this movie starred anybody else, then it would have came out a lot worse than it did. Russeell is Gabe Cash and Stallone is Ray Tango, the two toughest and hardest cops in the city. They have done so much damage to the crime syndicate's income that Yves Perret(a brilliant Jack Palance)has to take matters into his own hand and get the duo off the streets. They get set up and end up in a maximum security prison only to discover that if they don't escape, their is no hope for survival. This movie really owes a debt of gratitude to Harold Faltermeyer, who uses all kinds of COOL beats in his score throughout the film and keeps the viewer interested. This movie could have been longer, but I won't complain considering the action films that are being made these days are really stupid!"
3,Great guy/guy scenes,"Uh, this movie like, uhh, rocked and stuff, especially the shower scene with Kurt Russell and Sly Stallone. Explosions and car chases mar the otherwise tender story of men who wear badges, love each other, and put their lives on the line each day."
4,F*U*B*A*R!,"If you just get the movie (this price can't be beat) to find out what FUBAR means, you can also see one of the best ODD Couples (Stallone + Russell) since Oscar and Felix. My 4 star rating is not for OSCAR nominating stuff it is for pure entertainment value; if I WERE to do so, I would either get real 4 star movies or another life. Besides TANGO (Stallone) and CASH (Russell), there is Teri Hatcher as the Damsel in Distress and Jack Palance as the Villain!"
5,A nice movie/show to add to collection,"From the first time that I watched this movie/show... I loved it And now I have it for my collection to watch it over and over again, Thank you Amazon"
2,80's buddy cop movie,"It's no Lethal Weapon; I bought this cause I thought it was cool when I was a kid, not so cool as an adult when you can understand all the dialogue, in fact, you can probably say it sucks(a technical movie review term). But if you are into the whole 80's action movie genre then this would suit your tastes."
2,Two stars of Tango & Cash,"Tango & Cash is a movie about two cops (Stallone,Russell) that get framed, and get sent to prision for something they did not do. The interesting thing about Tango & Cash is that it is a comedy/action movie. There is good action in this movie but the comedy is not very good. Sylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell do a great job together. Stallone looks weird with his big glasses and banker suit, (the years of trying to branch out from Rocky & Rambo)Jack Palance however, does a good job at playing the vilian role.Overally Tango & Cash is an average movie and if you like action movies, you will enjoy this movie."
3,"Remember, this came out many years ago...","The first half of the film plods along, pacing slow. Picks up better after the prison stuff. Loved this movie when I was short, but after watching things like Lie to Me, Criminal Minds, Castle, NCIS, I'm afraid I've set up higher expectations. Don't get me wrong. Love the actors (even the villian), just wanted the plot to kick into high gear a bit earlier (like, say, at the beginning)...Put yourself in a 70s or 80s frame of mind, and it should be perfect."
3,Lethal...,"Still one of my favorite bad movies, despite awful Harold Faltermeyer score and an ending that doesn't make sense to me after half a dozen viewings. Couple of good in-jokes from the two stars about past film roles, with a real star turn from Mr. Russell. Michael J. Pollard and Jack Palance ham it up nicely. They could've called this ""Over the Top"" if the title hadn't already been used for one of Mr. Stallone's truly bad movies."
4,Typical Stallone and Russell.,"Tango and Cash is definately a typical ""guy"" flick but can be enjoyed by women who love action. Stallone and Russell do a great job as usual but the story line is predictable. Unfortunately, I could guess what was going to happen through most of the movie. Still worth watching."
1,Forgettable,this film was typical over the top 80's with different Gadgets and whatnot.Stallone doesn't have a chance in a Comedy or even a Semi-Comedy.Russell is out of place playing second fiddle to Stallone.
1,Why transfer garbage to Blu-Ray?,"With all the great films produced throughout the history of cinema, why do the studios insist on churning out garbage like this film onto blu-ray?I mean, let's be serious, would any fan of Tango and Cash really be concerned with the improved visual aesthetics provided by blu-ray?"
4,More classic Skinny Puppy,"An excellent amalgam of variouse S.P. styles. Includes the classic Dig It, and Stairs and Flowers (which could almost fall into the house music catagory) Includes stylistic features reminiscent of the Cleans Fold and Manipulate days. A good CD for the first time S.P. fan."
3,Good but not great Skinny Puppy,"Mind: The Perpetual Intercourse, like most Skinny Puppy recordings, has three very good tracks and the rest is filler. ""One Time One Place"" has a neat subtle melody on top of some brilliant percussion. ""Love"" creates a sonic atmosphere of despair associated with unrequited love. ""Antagonism"" is a heavy metal version of industrial using synths instead of guitars. The rest is unnecessary and lacks imagination. Bonus tracks don't help. The version used for the video ""Stairs And Flowers"" is much better than either version presented here. Cleanse Fold and Manipulate, Rabies and Remission are far better recordings than Mind: TPI."
2,Not very good and horribly dated,"Half of the chainsaw EP that's included as bonus tracks are probably the best thing about this cd, which saddens me. There's not a song on here I can really sit through because most of the tracks are repatative and abrasive without being very interesting. At times I expect them to break out into the Miami Vice Theme Song due to some of the samples and instruments used. The followup, Cleanse Fold and Manipulate, is much MUCH better than this."
5,Experienced cook,"I have 10+ years of stir-fry cooking experience. The directions call for boiling 3 minutes-it means 3 minutes-do not over cook. My wife and I appreciate the ease of cooking these noodles and I enjoy the many ways to use them. Give them a chance, you'll be glad you did."
5,OPENS THE GATES OF DREAMING,"THE RECORD HAS AN INCREDIBLE ATMOSPHERE ,JUST SIT,RELAX AND LET YOUR MIND REMEMBER THE FIRST MOMENT YOU FALL IN LOVE WHILE YOU ARE LISTENING TO ""ALISON"" OVER AND OVER AGAIN...."
5,simply a must buy:),"This album is undoubtedly the best album of the ""shoegazing"" genre and simply a must in any serious music lover's collection. It has such a variety of sublime sounds from intimate guitar riffs and lyrics to transcendental dreamscapes full of beautifully synthesized sounds - this album has it all. Without doubt one of the most avant-garde albums of the 90s and hugely underrated, but take my advice, do yourself a favour and buy this album! you wont be dissapointed!!!"
3,Inconsistently gorgeous trendsetter,3 1/2This album's distinguished production of guitar-soaked prettiness gives plenty of indication throughout why the band was such a massive underground influence..clearly wearing some influence themselves...but has a hard time sustaining such electric bliss when graceful signature hits like Souvlaki Space Station roared with such louder purpose then a lot of the wishy-washy writing.
4,Dive into this fast.,"I just recently picked this up after hearing the name for many years, because I was craving something along the ""shoegazer"" sound. I'm really glad I did, and I find this to be nearly the epitome of that genre. To compare, ""Souvlaki"" reminds me somewhat of early ""Lush"", a less catchy ""Cocteau Twins"", a more peaceful ""Ride"", and even a spacey ""Verve"", without any of those comparisons being too obvious. I also enjoy the both male and female vocals, where there are vocals. Overall I find this to be a must for any fan of the genre, and only wish I had gotten this 10 years ago."
4,A Definite Step Forward From Their First Album,"slowdive's second album fills out some of the missing holes in their great first album. it manages to stick to the shoegazer structure of ""just for a day"" with some neat tricks. some songs trail off, slowly fade, use harmonics. some songs are just tighther popish songs. i think the production is a bit better than the first album also. ""40 days,"" ""alison"" and ""souvlaki"" are amazing standout tracks. definitely worth checking out."
5,A beautiful blend of dark melodies and haunting atmosphere.,"The very first sound you hear when you start this CD let's you know you're in for a smooth ride. In the long line of artists that have a song called ""Alison,"" I think this one tops'em both lyrically and musically. The album continues to swirl around you, every detuned chord striking the nerves in your neck, nicely. Engineer and producer Brian Eno adds his own bit of noise to these tunes, creating ""pleasent static"" that drifts in and out of the music. This is a must have for your Brit-noise/pop collection."
4,Beautiful and dreamy,"Slowdive have such an irresistible sound... I feel like I'm floating in space and watching stars pass by my eyes when I listen to their albums. My favorite tracks on Souvlaki are Alison, Machine Gun, Here She Comes, and Souvlaki Space Station. The only reason I didn't give this album 5 stars was that I think that Just for a Day is an even better album, but Souvlaki is definitely worth owning."
2,"Sort of interesting, somewhat boring...","Let me preface my review by saying that this is the first record I'd heard from Slowdive, and I bought the disc solely because fans of My Bloody Valentine, Catherine Wheel, Ride and some of my other fave shoegazer bands seem to like it. What appeals to me about those acts is that every gorgeous melody is buried under a distorted wall of noise. Slowdive has a very lush, much less aggressive sound that's a lot closer to say Mazzy Star than any of the aforementioned bands. Which wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing, but I don't think the songs are particularly catchy so the overall effect sort of puts you to sleep. I'm also a big fan of Brian Eno's production work, but here everything has sort of a foggy sound that's so drenched in reverb that none of the vocals or instruments really stand out. I'm a big fan of shoegazer bands and dream pop, but in my opinion this is a pretty boring representative of the genre."
5,The other side of the shoegazing coin... another masterpiece,"I can go on for days listening to Slowdive. Whether it is this album or ""Just for a Day"", I could almost live off of their music. Shoegazing or not... it doesn't matter. Slowdive made some magical music, while they lasted, and their albums are pearls meant to live well beyond the time they came out. As it stands, both albums provide a dreamy framework for you to work, read or write to, or simply sit back and enjoy as you would a delicious banquet you would rather repeat over and over if you could afford it.Neil Halstead, Rachel Goswell and company, who later re-formed under the name Mojave 3, afford us the treat of Slowdive in ""Souvlaki"" and their other musical masterpiece, ""Just for a Day"", both considered milestones of the shoegazing musical movement. Both albums are solid productions that perfectly represent the genre, and reach out to pull you in playing musical tricks, ending up comfortably in my list of essential albums."
1,Fire Under the Sea: Unlighted,A fascinating topic torpedoed by bad writing. I wish Cone had directed the book to an audience of adults.
5,This bra is so comfortable!,I don't like underwires. This bra is perfect for what I need. Unfortunately I think Warner's has stopped making this style...
1,A disappointment,"I know it's hard to write a book, so I feel badly about dissing this one. However, it is not good. The projects shown are, almost without exception, out of scale and ""clunky"" looking, rather like a very young Brownie troop's efforts. I was very unhappy when I received it and found nothing in it of value. I suspect I am not alone in my estimation as copies of this book began appearing on Thrift Shop shelves soon after its release. Sorry guys, it's just no good."
3,Very disappointed on the contents of this book.,"Yes, granted these are no sew projects, but I feel they are for the very beginner. The pictures are not clear and there is no detail to creating the objects in this book. It is basically cut a piece of material, wrap it around an object and glue. Many of you miniaturists have already gone far beyond this point. I appreciate the efforts of the authors but I personally feel this is a very beginner type craft book."
2,Not scary,"In this video, a single narrator recounts ghost stories from the Cotswolds region. No first-person accounts, no photographic or video evidence...just a rather pleasant-sounding woman telling us we should be frightened by what she's about to say. If you like ghost stories that make you sleep with the lights on, save your money. This video will have you sleeping like a baby."
3,No investigations?,It was slow and a little boring. I'm sure those places are haunted but I wanted some first hand accounts not he said she said. Its worth a watch if there are none.of the paranormal shows on.
3,it was just ok,It was just ok in my opinion... it was more like a tour of the cotswolds than a film on hauntings. It was a tad on the boring side.
4,As close to the Tarzan as it gets.,"I love old Tarzan movies, but with the rare exceptions, they made him look like an idiot. Greystoke, while straying from canon, respects the character's ability to learn as depicted in the first book. It's just a pity that there was never a sequel."
1,Ordered wrong !,"Due to my not paying attention when I ordered this movie, I didn't notice that the format was VHS, therefore I have no way to play it. It was due to my stupidity that I wound up with an unplayable item. Oh well, call me dumb."
3,When comes the DVD??,"Note July 7th 2004. So finally it's released on DVD. Worth waiting for??!!/Tomas.A pretty good movie I would like to see on DVD! Anyone who knows when it will be released? From 1984 the make-up is still stunning, infact not at all far from the recent Burton's Planet of The Apes...The film sometimes tends to get a little silly - proving it is difficult to convert an original old victorian story to moving pictures. In mind is when Tarzan is being introduced to the 'upper English class'."
3,Great Christmas gift,this item was another Christmas gift for my husband. It was also one of the many movies he had on his need list. This movie isn't really my type of movie but other people would probably enjoy it. Working with amazon was easy and simple and the item arrived in plenty of time.
5,Tarzan,"Quick Shipment, arrived in great condition. Excellent product for the price. The adaptation of Edgar Rice Burroughs books out there."
4,Lambert's Tarzan - A Classic,"This version of the story of Tarzan should please every Tarzan fan. The actors are wonderful, the scenery and photography superb and the attention to detail with regards to how primates act is magnificent."
4,Dated,I liked this book and I feel it is a wroth while read. I only give it 4 starts because a great deal of the information provided is dated.
3,Pressland's Not-So-Great Book of Tin Toys,"Time for a reality check, folks. I tracked this book down because I'm a tin toy freak, and I read all kinds of glowing words about the book itself, re: production, photography, etc. Turns out it's a treat for tin toys up till WWII, but almost laughable in its coverage of post war pieces. Also, the production isn't all that great -- nice tin piece attached to the cover, but on my new copy the red cover was bubbled in one spot, and there were pages stuck together with glue. The photography is okay, but not spectacular, and the production values are pretty much routine for a picture/text book like this. The slipcase is boring in design -- in short, I've had coffee tables that looked more spectacular than this coffee table book.Don't get me wrong:it's a valuable and often beautiful book, and Mr. Pressland should be congratulated on his work, but it just isn't worth this kind of money."
5,Beautiful,My Signed book Presslands Great Book Of Tin Toys was the topic at a Toy get together. I was offered 3 times the Amazon.com price for this book. People who look this book over are Taken back by the Photography. Get yours before they are all gone.
1,Boring interviews,"Besides disk has a bug. After 10 min it starts show you last 3 interview over and over again until you click to the next chapter on your remote.Whole move made of interviews of psychologists, philosophers, one quantum physicist. There is no graphic accompanying their thoughts or scientific facts. Persons sit and express their opinions. Nice background behind and music which take you down to the sleep. It's like hypnosis. So my wife took off first and I in 15 minutes or so. It's good to watch if you can't fall asleep. Really helpful.On one hand they have some interesting thoughts in another one they talking of something in so blur manner of thought expression... I did not get for myself more then I already know.For someone who looking for truth I'd recommend ""The Privileged Planet / Unlocking the Mystery of Life 2-DVD"".The Privileged Planet / Unlocking the Mystery of Life 2-DVD Set"
5,Highly recommended,"I used this product for the first time on my 18 cabinet kitchen cabinet project. I highly recommend this product. It's easy to work with, very low odor, and great looking. I've used polyrerethane and laquer finishes but I am going to make this product my primary choice on future projects.Tips:- Before applying, do not use Tack Cloth to clean. Tack cloth contains wax which can potentially cause cratering. Use a cheese cloth lightly dampened or cheese cloth with an atomizing water spray bottle to clean the surface of dust.- This product dries fast so work fast to minimize dry drags across the finished product."
3,Nice read,"Though I enjoyed this book, I found parts of it a chore to read. Though it hooked me right away, thestory seamed to stray at times, before coming back and catch my attention."
1,Puddle Maker,"I did not like this humidifier for the simple fact that I had a very damp carpet after using it. I put it in the kitchen on the counter so that the puddle went into the sink. This doesn't help when I'm sleeping though and is in the way when I have to wash the dishes. I tried adjusting the out put with the knob but it still made the area in front pretty damp. I also didn't like that I had to lift the top part off, turn it upside down to fill. Next one will have a fill cap on the top to make it easier. I would find a better one next time."
3,"Quiet, but it creates a puddle","Three stars seems a little harsh, but I'm not sure it's important for a $35 humidifier to earn much more. Other ultrasonic humidifiers (though probably slightly more effective) cost three times this much, so I don't mind setting a towel in front of it.The humidifier has a large, easy-to-fill reservoir, enough for two nights on a low setting. It also runs very quietly, which is nice since most people use it when they're sleeping. I think it makes just enough noise to provide the comfort of white noise without keeping you up at night. I also like that itThe puddle, however, is kind of a pain. Of the two gallons that are emitted each night, probably 3/4 cup returns to the ground in front of the unit. You will definitely want to place a towel around it to protect your floors."
2,Good While It Lasted,"I bought this unit last winter after researching the various models available on Amazon. It worked pretty well, effectively humidifying my medium-sized bedroom, though sometimes it needed to be off-balance (aka not level) in order to produce mist. It also left white powder in the room, despite being filled with bottled water.I recently plugged it in again, and could not get it to produce mist. I cleaned it thoroughly, tried resting it at various angles, nothing. I finally gave up and bought the Air-O-Swiss AOS Ultrasonic Humidifier 7131, and I'm much happier. It has a demineralization cartridge, automatic shutoff, mist and humidity control, optional microbial inhibitor, and is significantly quieter.If you need a reliable humidifier with intermediate features for respiratory health, I recommend the Air-O-Swiss far ahead of the Sunbeam."
1,Seemed like a nice product.....for 6 hours.,"Thought I would like this product. However, it quit working after 6 hours. I had to send it back. I tried everything that I could to get it going again. Motor was running, but no vapor coming out. I'll look for another brand. Hope your experience is better!!!"
1,WET!,This is a terrible product because all it did was soak the floor. All the steam just condensed 1 inch away from it and landed on it or the floor.
2,Sunbeam Ultrasonic Humidifier,"Very well designed. Easy to fill without spilling. Easy to carry. No noise. Very happy with this one.One year later: Well, it didn't last very long. Also, my old noisy unit puts out about 2 gallons every night, five times more than this little toy."
1,This thing doesn't work,"I ordered this product and it worked for about one day and then completely stopped working. We tried everything and failed. I wouldn't order this product from amazon, go to an actual store where you can look at all of your options.This prodcut offers you limited control, it drips all over the floor, and is a bit bulky. I would recommend something else!"
1,Doesn't work,"We exchanged the machine for two times. Every time, the humidifier stop working after on for one hour around, and water flows out to the surrouding surface. It seems there are some problems with the air circulation."
1,terrible. leaks. ruined my wood nightstand.,"I bought this item on Amazon.com because it had some decent reviews. Turned out to be a terrible item for us and our old humidifier with replaceable filters was WAY better. Not only did it not mist that well, it leaked all over my expensive wood nightstand and actually ruined the wood top. My wife hates this thing and we are going to throw it away."
2,"Stopped working, but replaced","I purchased this humidifier, and it worked wonderfully with a soothing blue night light for my son for about a week. One night, it just stopped producing that humidifying mist and could not be coaxed into working again. I called the company, who told me to promptly cut the cord and throw it out, and they would be sending a new one to replace it (with no cost for shipping to me). I received the new one a week later, which to my disappointment, did not have the nightlight feature. I also noticed it was from a different brand company. I can't remember the name but it also began with the word ""sun."" So far, the new humidifier is working fine (about 2 weeks now), but it has a lower water capacity so I have to refill it every night (vs. every 2 nights with the original one) and the lack of the nightlight is a big disappointment. The process of replacing, however, was very smooth and also free so I'll give them 2 stars for that."
1,I am not sure,"This is the first time I am purchasing Humidifier.When I start using it, it mess up whole floor with water. I have to use a BIG sheet to collect all the water and then pour it in the morning. Then, the tank cap is not opening. Now I am using the small hole to fill the water.I will NOT recommend to any one."
4,Good Product Overall,"It is quite dry in my home and this humidifier provides a fine mist of good quality. I have had no leaking problems or other difficulties. It is quite for the most part, with the exception of a gurgling noise every 30 min or so. All in all, I'm pleased with my purchase."
3,Good for the price,"I wish that this product actually told you what the humidity level in the room is so that you could have the ""precise"" humidity control the product claims to have. You can turn off the light, which is nice. Also, I have found that if you keep it at the lowest output level the wetness on the floor is much less."
4,My second one,"I loved the first one I had, then lost a piece while storing over the summer. I wish the water would last a little longer, and I have to keep a plastic bag under it as the condensation tends to build up underneath. However, it's a great humidifier and makes a big difference here in my office."
1,Junk,"When it is new and working, it is a nice machine. I have had 2 of them fail in a matter of months. Poor design allows water into the fan/motor area. Expensive and does not last. Do not by."
3,Functional but a little too loud,"It works very well and also has a night light which prevents you from knocking it out at night. However, I find myself turning it off at night due to the noise."
3,Good product - White Dust a Problem,"Overall satisfied with the Sunbeam Ultrasonic. Stays clean, doesn't have the isssues that filter humidifiers have, however, the white dust that it leaves in the room isn't ideal."
5,Very good humidifier,"This product is easy to use, easy to clean, and very effective. I use it in the baby's room and it makes the whole room a lot more comfortable than the usual california dry environment. The unit has a blue light, which you can turn off if you don't want it bright. The humidifier is relatively quiet, except you'll hear dripping sound as the water is transported within. I like the sound because it put me to sleep. The fog is cool, and very concentrated. If you are using hard water, you might find the white dust residue nearby, but not a big deal at all. So far I have had this unit for a year, and it's one of the best humidifiers I have ever used."
3,"Worked great for two winters, then died","When it worked, it worked great- no white dust (I used filtered water only), it's almost silent, and it humidifies well. I used it for two winters and then this winter, it decided to shoot the mist out in fits. I cleaned the oscillator and tried putting in less water but nothing worked. My hygrometer told me it was no longer humidifying the room. Since the warranty is limited to 1 year, it went straight into the trash."
1,warning about ultrasonic humidifiers,"I came across a warning (I believe from the American Academy of Pediatrics) warning about the use of humidifiers that use ultrasonic technology to disperse moisture into air - I'm sorry to not be more specific, but I believe they said it could either cause asthma or breathing problems for young ones due to minerals being ""pulverized"" and sent into the air (minerals that aren't normally small enough to cross mucous membranes in humans). I'm sure if you google keywords, you can come across this info. However, the same article did encourage use of cool mist humidifiers that did not use this technology."
3,Okay for a very small room,"We got this humidifier based on the reviews we read. It is very quiet and easy to fill up, but the output must be meant for a VERY SMALL SPACE. I wanted a humidifier because it is very dry in our apartment and I'm also 5 months pregnant, which translates as having more sensitive sinus cavities. I wouln't recommend this unless you are planning to use it for a small room, like a tiny study or baby room. The plus to this humidifier compared to others is that you don't have to spend a ton on filters."
1,"Gee, it was great for 40 minutes !","I was so excited to buy this humidifier as my own pharmacy had one running and I really need the nebulizer-type action for my sinuses. I dropped $50 on it, took it home, plugged it in and enjoyed the cooling mist action for all of 40 minutes. The unit then completely stopped working - no motor, no light, no mist. DOA. Now I have to go through the hassle of returning this thing...and at Christmas time!"
2,A little too noisy for me...,"Pros: Great water capacity, okay mist production, night light feature is nice, easy to setup and use.Cons: The water's reaction to the ultrasonic vibrations is quite noisy. I removed the tank while the unit was running to see what was causing the noise and was a bit surprised to see a small, intermittent water fountain appearing above the ultrasonic vibrator. The 'dripping' noise was the water falling back down on itself! In addition, you can hear the water drip from the tank into the base unit and the angle of the mist as it exists the humidifier seems to be mostly in an upwards direction (80 degrees) rather than in an upwards/outward direction (55 degrees).Summary: Given the price point, it's not a bad humidifier; the Vick's Ultrasonic Humidifier is a few dollars more and just a little bit less noisy."
1,Item never shipped!,"I ordered this humidifier 3 weeks ago. It showed ""usually ships in 1-2 weeks"" and so I waited and waited and my order showed ""not yet shipped"" past the estimated ship date. Buyer beware, I'll be purchasing this some where else!"
3,Ok Humidifier,"Mist seems to shoot up pritty far before falling, I haven't left it on all night because it hasn't been too dry. It does have a problem with the waterlevel sensor or something, I need to tilt the water reservoir for it to steam (which might be a problem others have had). Currently propped up the reservoir so that it does steam all the time, but am going to try tinkering with the water sensor and might return it. It also has a slight problem with leaking when moving the reservoir up and down, but as long as you make sure it's not leaking, it hasn't had any spontanious problems."
3,Not there yet,"While this humidifier looks nice, it has its particular problems that should be considered. To refill the unit, you must remove the entire blue part - no refilling it using a watering can. You remove the blue part, flip it over, unscrew a lid (definitely a problem there: plastic threads never last long) & finally refill the unit. Yes, this is the best unit I've seen, but the engineering has a way to go. It's not ""there"" yet."
1,defective product,"I read all the reviews, then bought this product....it worked like a charm for less than a week, then it stoped working! Don't waste your time on this brand."
2,cold humidifer,"its okay. If its not high enough off the floor the floor is saturated. I bought if for my dry sinuses during the winter months. It does its job, just don't like the wet carpet."
5,Humidifier,"Very pleasant humidifier, has a nice blue light which is nice in a dark. The only downfall is that when it's being used, all my furniture has white dust mostly because of the quality of the water."
4,So far so good...,"Was looking for an ultrasonic humidifier since I like to see the moisture. I was a bit scared since most have mixed reviews, but so far this is working as advertised and I like the blue night light feature."
2,nice light but not a very good product,"Can't adjust mist volume like every other humidifier out there on the market, oh sure... you can close off the opening where the mist comes out which results in water streaming down the front of humidifier...with a towel under unit its ok.....the night light feature is cool..glowing blue water ..but all and all not so hot...give it a big OK."
3,Long term user,"The Humidifier while is good in price, the long term is so, so. I bought two of these and one of them is already broken.The issues:- Filling it with water is difficult, the cap gets stuck and is VERY hard to remove it after sometime- Noise. The noise it produces is as a ""water fountain"". You will listen to water and it can become annoying to fall asleep.- Minerals. If your water is high on minerals, not only you will have white dust, but the machine will stop working and you need to constantly clean a small ""circle"" that produces the vibration that creates the steam."
4,easy to use,the unit is very easy to use and has worked well with most all of what got hooked up to it. A manual mode for batteries that are very dead would be a plus.
5,It's the best,It brought me back to my college days and I love his music. This is the best anthology I have heard of any musician. It is well worth the buy and it is great listening.
3,Loved the CD. Great to hear his evolution.,Have loved Boz for many years. He never fails to improve one's mood. I'll buy more.
4,Good representation of the artists work!,"This is a great CD for the casual fan of one of America's great musical artists. It is a good representation of a body of work. Good production values and digital remastering. The only problem is that all of us old fans of Boz want CD's of his greatest works, ""MY TIME"" and ""MOMENTS"", the two LP's that haven't become available in CD format. Come on Boz, I know there is a demand for this material!"
3,This One's for the Die-Hards,"In 1976, Boz Scaggs turned out a masterpiece of an album entitled ""Silk Degrees."" It's smash hit songs, including Grammy-winner ""Lowdown"" were staples of that era. But they really only reflect one side of Boz Scaggs' talent. The problem is, that's really the side most people are probably interested in. This anthology is all-encompassing and covers Boz' earliest works up until 1997 when this collection came out. By then, the blues-influenced artist had moved on to more of an adult contemporary/ballads style of singing. Fans interested in a certain style of Boz Scaggs' may be better served by purchasing his individual albums. ""Silk Degrees"" or ""Hits"" would probably serve the needs of most buyers. But if you're interested in hearing his evolution, this collection will take you through his many phases."
2,Too abstract for young children,"I am the parent of a 2 and 4 year old, and bought this book because I needed to explain to them about death. I was looking for a book to explain the death of someone who wasn't old or sick for very long and who didn't get to say goodby to his friends. This book was not the right one for my purposes.I found it to be too abstract. Badger doesn't die, he goes down a ""long tunnel."" Also, he appears to either have been sick for a while or simply coming to the end of a long full life.If you have older children, ages 8 to 10, and they already understand about death, then perhaps this book could be comforting. Then again, it might just make them afraid of long tunnels."
5,A reminder of all we still have from someone who has died,"I read this book to my kids when they were younger and my dad was gravely ill. He pulled through that time, but died a few months ago. Our copy has disappeared in the meantime, but I thought this book important enough to order a copy for my young niece and nephew. A few months after a death, when the initial pain has worn off a little, or when a death may be imminent seem like the perfect times to read this story. Badger's friends are sad, but at a stage when they are able to remember wonderful things about his life and their frienships with him."
5,"My go-to gift, but beware!","My son and I first stumbled across this story in a collection of children's stories when he was 5. I thought it was a beautiful tale of healing; he was disturbed by it. He's 9 now and still shies away from it. In the stiory, Badger accepts death happily, and his friends go from grief to celebrating his life and his giving nature.I have given this book to several friends' children when a grandparent has died (in one case, a great-grandparent). Every time, the parents have come back later to express a huge thank you and tell me how perfect the book was for talking with their child about their departed grandparent.So, great book for little kids struggling to come to terms with the death of a loved one, but not a simple story to casually pick up."
1,Terrible Product,"- Stopped working after three uses. I switched the batteries and nothing happened. I applied oil like some other people mentioned and still nothing.- Attachments are all made of cheap plastic.- The 6-position guide trimmer slides between the various positions as you are shaving due to the cheap plastic construct.- Wahl's ""limited warranty"" on this product:""If your Wahl product fails to operate satisfactorily... Wahl will, at our option, repair or replace it and return it to you... [you are to] mail your product prepaid... [and] enclose a check or money order in the amount of $6.50.""In other words, you are to pay for shipping both ways and include a $6.50 fee, all of which will add up to more than the price of this product.An overall excellent experience. Please not the sarcasm in that previous statement."
4,Walh Beard Trimmer Review,"At first, I thought the product wasn't going to be that good. But after a couple of uses and using the oil, it appears to work quite well. It's a very good value for what you get. I'd definitely recommend this to someone."
3,A little snarky.,This is a really good trimmer as far as the way it cuts and battery life etc. But I used to use a conair trimmer that just felt better in the hand and was esier to get the results I wanted. This one is a little strange in the hand and the guides are really hard to use without getting a closer shave than you really want.
2,Horrible,"Won't run on NiMH rechargable batteries (I use Eneloop, awesome batteries). Drains even quality alkalines really fast (I can get like two sessions out of a set, whereas my Braun Pocketgo shaver will last for a couple months and runs fine with my Eneloops). Doesn't have a lot of power. I got a haircut the other day and I don't know what brand of trimmer they used but it was about the same size, battery operated and it was an amazing difference. This piece doesn't even begin to compare. Do not buy!"
