3,ok,"Nothing special, not as well made as the Tyton Brand but that price went thro the roof...in a pinch these work"
4,Great and Unique Christmas Album,"Another great release from Todd Agnew. Not your typical Christmas album. I is all about experiencing the first Christmas through the eyes, and songs, of those who were there -- Mary, Joseph, the Magi, the innkeeper, etc. The only reason that I don't give it 5-stars is, that Todd Agnew only sings three songs himself. Don't get me wrong, the other artists do a great job, but I was really hoping to hear Todd a little more. Pick it up today, you won't regret it."
5,Do You See What I See?,"This was such a great insperational album for Christmas. I really enjoyed playing it during the Christmas season. It was the ablum that I played the most during Christmas, everyone asked ""What is the name of that Album"". And I told them. I hope to sing some of the songs this coming year during our Christmas Pagent at Church. Is there anyway I can purchase the sound track? Would greatly like to hear from you.May you continue to Bless the Lord's Name in 2007.Keep up the great work!!!!!^WD^"
4,Todd Agnew Do you see what I see?,Anyone who has listened to Todd's music understands that he is a true talent and brings contemporary Christian music into mainstream. His words are true and speak to our souls!
5,This Book is Fun Fun Fun!,My daughter is 12 and loves this book! Step by Step makes it easy for many ages. Lots of fun and creative ideas. We like it so much we're getting one for my niece.
3,Nail Art,"I was looking for a book with lots of nail art examples. This book has a few nice examples, but also includes bracelets and rings other fun things to make if that is what interests you."
2,"Novelty, Not accurate","Unfortunately there is no enlarged picture of this product to show you that the eagle is not the one on the other brand flags of this style. The eagle is very cartoon-ish and goofy looking, not the Imperial eagle which should be on the flag. Otherwise, the material is of good quality."
3,Two Coat Of Arms,"The coat of arms (the eagle) depicted on this flag for sale is the ""official"" unofficial version. What this means is Germany has two versions, one for offical government use only, and one for civilian use. This coat of arms matches the unofficial version, the civilian use variant, so it is an authentic design. Use of the offical flag by non-government officials is against the law. Therefore Amzazon.com may not be able to legally sell one (trade and commerce laws) and it may be near impossible to find one from any commercial seller. (See the differance in the two flags: ""List of German Flags,"" Wikipedia). Polyester material flags are lighter, thinner, and therefore cheaper and flaws do appear, so for that aspect buyer beware."
4,Good,Thank you! love this product so much. This is like what i expected. I would like to recommend this product to my friends.
4,Best German Flag on Amazon... that ships to Australia,"Whilst I love the German flag I've recited, compared to the store bought Australian and Eureka Stockade flags I own, alongside the Collingwood Magpies flag owned by my brother, this product pales in comparison. The materials it was made of could've been better, and at a similar, if not SLIGHTLY more expensive cost.4/5 instead of a 3/5 only because as I said, it is hard to obtain a foreign flag in Australia (unless it's American) and this is the best GERMAN flag you can get in Australia."
2,It isnt a real flag,I was very excited when my flag arrived but when I put it on my room's wall i was very disappointed cause the eagle is surrounded by a white line I mean the entire shield and this looks like 4 a toy or something like that but is not the real flag of Germany.
4,"Pretty good, actually.","I think that the previous reviewer - C. Cross ""Music Lover"" - failed to realize that this album came out well before Franz Ferdinand's first album (Sept.'03). It's true that they were also influenced by Gang of Four, and you can definitely hear it. Their sound isn't exceptional or incredibly unique and the lead singer's voice is rather lackluster. However, it IS a good album for this genre of music. The songs are eclectic and the melodies are pleasing. This album will be liked by people who enjoy The Futureheads, Franz Ferdinand, Kaiser Chiefs, The Strokes, The Killers, Constantines, Idlewild or any of the other indie-revival bands."
4,Wow!,"I just finished reading ""Ideaship"". What a delight! The expected Foster brevity and pith, coupled with the charm and whimsy of Corby's drawings.For fifteen years I was in charge of the advertising department of Sunkist Growers. A copy of ""Ideaship"" would have made me much more of an ""ideaist"". The department would have run better and we all would have enjoyed the creative process even more. Happily, I had worked at Foote, Cone & Belding while Jack was Creative Director so at least a little of his ""ideaship"" style had already been aquired by personal osmosis. The book would have made it so much easier.Thanks, Jack, for such a rewarding couple of hours."
5,Foster Does it Again,"Written by one of America's greatest communicators (if you've ever turned on a TV, you've seen his award-winning commercials) this sweet little guide is even better than ""How to Get Ideas."" Foster has, once again, distilled the elements of creativity in such effortless prose that you'll think you knew all of it in the first place. Which is, fundamentaly, the book's principal intent.Clever, concise, and charmingly illustrated, anyone who appreciates the power of ideas would be wise to buy this book, read this book, and wedge it between ""The Elements of Style"" and ""A Technique for Producing Ideas."" It's that good."
4,"Uncommon Wisdom In Quick, Fun Doses","This book by Jack Foster is highly deceptive. It is short, simple and fun to read, yet happens to be packed with wisdom and experience. Foster's style is utterly, disarmingly, straight to the point, which makes this book all the more useful since the subject is ordinarily so elusive. One chapter, for example, contains just 38 words, but the point is a blockbuster. And in my experience as CEO of a large international company, 80% or more of all key executives do not incorporate its truth into their practice. If you are involved with organizational creativity in any way, or just interested in the area generally, you may well find the book as fun and thought-provoking as I did."
4,Only Book to give me Chills,I read this book as a teen and really loved it.Never before has a book made me nervous or given me the chills. This book was shocking and I couldn't turn the pages fast enough. I thought at the time it was a little scary.I recommend.
3,Black Water prity good book,This book was ok the begining was ok but the end was ok.It was about 13 year old Brodie feels bad because he thinks he killed two of his classmates. the rest is about how he feels bad. This book wasn't realy my type if you like tradgities you will like it.
3,Blackwater reivue,"This book is good, but personally the ending stunk. Besides the end, that really stunk, the book was pretty good. I'd recommend this book to others how like bad endings, adreneline pumping moments. I'd recommend this book to others."
3,Blackwater,"Welcome to Black Water a town that everyone is in danger. I this small town there's a river that runs through it. Three kids liked in this town Pauline, Otis, and Brodie. One day Brodie found Pauline and Otis were kissing near the river. Brodie got upset about them kissing because he liked Pauline and he thought that Pauline liked him. Brodie decided to play a joke on them but the joke turned bad.I liked this book because it had a lot of action like when Pauline and Otisfell into the river and everyone was running around looking for them. The author really described things like flowers and stuff like that beautify. When I read thins book I got a real visual of what was happing. In this book I was really surprised when Brodie jumped into the river to find them.I would recommend this book for fifth graders. I think that anyone whoread this book above fifth grade would get board. They would like this book because of the reading level and the action."
1,have not tried it-- READ MY REVIEW!!!!!,"I saw another mini microphone it got one star, the review was telling me it was horable. If i were you I would get the maga phone one the top of the list, type in maga phone in the search and you will find the list.DO NOT GET THIS!!!!!"
4,Good Intro,This is a good intro into whole leaf green tea I think. It's better than bagged green teas I have tried but not as good as some other whole leaf teas I have tried. This is good because people at first will put more leafs in than they need due to never trying whole leaf tea. This tea isn't that strong so new comers wont be turned up by over bitterness when using to many leafs. I find though that some other more expensive whole leaf teas to be a little more robust in flavor. For the price it's worth getting if your not looking to spend $50+ on some other 16oz teas. Due to the fact that this was sitting in a warehouse for a while I would recommend taking 3/4ths of it and putting it in the freezer as it can/ will mold fast if left out. It will take you a while to use up all 16ozs.
2,last shipment was crude,"used to be excellent tea, but last shipment arrived kind-of crude, the tea is weak. i hope they will restore the quality"
4,LIFE OF FRANCIS MARION.....,"THIS BOOK IS ONE ONE THAT MAKES THE SWAMP FOX GLOW. ITS PREFACE ALLOWS THE READER TO SEE THAT IT WAS WRITTEN BY REV. WEEMS WHO HAS A VERY ROMANTIC VIEW OF THIS FINE REVOLUTIONARY OFFICER. IN THIS BOOK THE GENERAL CAN DO NO WRONG AND IS BASICALLY FLAWLESS. PLEASE NOTE THAT THE AUTHOR STARTED THE MYTHS ABOUT WASHINGTON NEVER BEING ABLE TO TELL A LIE AND CHOPPING DOWN THE CHERRY TREE. OVERALL, IT IS A FEEL GOOD BOOK THAT MAKES ONE ROOT FOR THE CONTINENTALS. THE ONLY NEGATIVE IS THAT THE BOOKS SCOPE IS TOO BROAD, AND DRIFTS FROM THE SWAMP FOX TO OTHER PLAYERS IN THE WAR FOR INDEPENDENCE"
5,Truly outstanding,"Written in 1824, the poetic descriptions are seldom found in todays authors. Captures the spirit of the times and causes one to cheer the heroics of the brave American soldiers. The citizens of the USA today owe such a debt to those who fought for our freedom, yet, we hardly hear a word about these times. Should be required reading in schools and universities."
2,too mushy,It makes Peter Horry and Francis Marion to mushy. I wanted the fighting side not the staring into each others eyes and appearing to fall in love scenero.Peter Horry was not pleased with it and told the Rev. to do what he wished with it and it was printed.This could have been addedlater but for the beginning it turned me off.
4,Neat and Discrete,I bought this item 3 years ago before we remodeled our bathroom. After not having them for a while I discovered that I really needed them so the the children would not slip in the tub. They work perfect because they are small and clear. It's a great product.
4,"Insightful and very ""readable"" history.","Excerpted from Foote's renowned multi-volume history of the Civil War, ""Stars in Their Courses"" gives a solid account of the Gettysburg Campaign. It is a shining example of history written as a novel -- one can learn and be entertained at the same time. Foote's research is good and he can certainly turn a phrase! For those new to Civil War history or without a firm academic background in the subject, ""Stars in Their Courses"" and its sister volume on the Vicksburg Campaign, ""The Beleaguered City,"" are excellent starting points. My only complaint: poor maps."
2,Stars in Their Courses,"I am trying to finish this book now. I find his style of writing very hard to follow. There are no chapters and very few breaks, it's one page after another. I have already found two myths about the Battle of Gettysburg that the author has stated as fact. He just seems not to have done a thorough job in his research. If you want a very good book on this subject read the following, ""Gettysburg, A Testing of Courage"" by Noah Andre Trudeau"
4,Very good overall,"Overall, this book is a very good summary of perhaps the most important battle ever fought on American soil. It is packed with information and reads extremely fast. However, I think Foote's southern roots show in the amount of detail he provides about confederate and federal commanders and their tactics. For example, he provides great detail about lesser known and lower ranking confederate officers while writing all of about two sentences about U.S. Col. Joshua Chamberlain, who prevented the Union army from being flanked with a critical stand on Little Round Top. I would still recommend this book to anyone wanting to know more about this pivotal moment in U.S. history."
3,Gifted writer but style may not appeal to some - Not for novice readers,"Mr. Foote is a talented writer of prose, but some readers may find his style of writing an obstacle at times. Also, the reader really needs to have some knowledge of CW military personnel/battles/events before reading this book; otherwise, you will need supplemental references to digest his narrative. For someone who is a Civil War history/Battle of Gettysburg novice/buff, I would recommend reading: ""Gettysburg: A Testing of Courage"" by Noah Trudeau, which is a straightforward, interesting read with the inclusion of personal accounts and footnoted information. I thoroughly enjoyed listening to Mr. Foote's commentaries/interviews, but I'm not sure his writing style is as appealing."
4,A very good book,I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I actually have read it twice. The first time was 6 months ago and then again after having visited Gettysburg. Foote's writting style is extremely eloquent. My bigggest complaint about this book was Foote's obvious pro-southern bias. As another reviewer mentioned Joshua Chamberlain and the 20th Maine barely get 2 sentences mention. Throughout the book Foote mentions how the South was outnumbered but in situations where the North was (For example the 1st Minnesota's suicidal charge) he doesn't go into that kind of detail. So other than his obvious bias I highly recomment this book as an easy to read primer for both the knowledgeable Civil War reader as well as the nephyte.
2,It's a Matter of Taste,"Shelby Foote's narrative style might appeal to some, but it doesn't work for me. I find his writing style just gets in the way of an already compelling subject. It feels as if he's trying too hard to sound erudite. I found Stephen Sears account of Gettysburg a much better smoother read.The fact that Foote is not a trained historian is also evident as his account of Gettysburg is full of the anecdotes that most historians have since determined to be some of the many myths of the battle of Gettysburg."
2,This product doesn't work!,"I bought this product in the hopes that my manicure could last at least a week. Mind that if you regularly use water (washing hands, washing dishes, washing your hair daily) it won't work! Don't waste your money with this product. It recommends that you use the Orly Bonder Base Coat, WHICH I DID, but nothing. So I spent like 12 USD in both products for nothing!!! If you're lucky, your nail color will last 2 days, but no more if you are in constant contact with water. I only give it 2 stars because I like the polished glossy finish but I guess you can accomplish that with another product like the 2-in-1 base and top coat."
1,Just say no,"I bought this product thinking that it would not chip my nails, but it chips them even more than what they were doing on their own. It makes my nails harder (even though I have naturally hard nails), but then after a couple of hours, the polish cracks and you can see lines in my nail polish where it starts to chip. I would definitely not recommend this product to anyone."
1,"Should Change the name ""Will Chip""","Thia stuff is horrible! It looks great going on, but after about a day, its cracks and peels off leaving my nails looking worse than if I used a normal top coat. I don't beat my hands up that much. They chipped just cooking dinner. I would NOT recommend this product!"
3,Kinda Hokey,"I was a big A's fan when i was a young teen in the early Seventies so i had to get this book many years ago - don't expect any great revelations and anything of importance from this book - do expect the typical hokey quick read baseball book and do expect to find Catfish at the center of everything important that ever happened with the A's and the Yankees then - only an A's/Yankees fan should really consider buying this book. But God rest his soul, too."
4,CATFISH CAUGHT ME HOOK LINE AND SINKER,"THIS IS A VERY GOOD BOOK, WRITTEN BY ONE OF THE BEST PITCHERS IN THE 1970'S. CATFISH TELLS OF HIS DAYS AS A CHILD AND THRU TO HIS DAYS AS A YANKEE. HIS STORIES OF THE A'S AND THE BRONX ZOO ARE THE HIGH LIGHT OF THIS BOOK. I THINK HE WAS A VERY DOWN TO EARTH AND HUMBLE PERSON. I WAS VERY SADDENDED BY HIS RECENT DEATH. I RECOMMEND THIS FOR ALL BASEBALL FANS. WELL WORTH IT."
3,The description needs work,"I ordered this tape thinking that it was a series of tapes on advanced oriental massage. It is not. What I got was a 45 minute tape on Body Shiatsu. Since the description of this product is not very detailed I made a purchasing mistake that I'd like to help others avoid. Not that there is a problem with the product, the details need work.If you are like me, if you order this product, you imagine that you'll get a series of tapes for $75, not just one tape.Since the description reads ""Facial Treatment Videotapes Professional Education"", I expected to get a few tapes that discussed facial treatment techiques in detail. Not so. On box of the video tape that I did receive, it listed about 10 other video tapes in the series on Shiatsu, but I only received one on ""Body Shiatsu"". I hope this helps you make a wiser purchasing decision. Amazon kindly refunded me for this order by the way."
2,Low-Budget Boris,"Boris Karloff plays a kinder, gentler mad scientist in his only chiller for Monogram Pictures. The horror icon adds some dignity to the low-budget proceedings, but cannot redeem a familiar storyline. Thanks in part to Kurt Siodmak's screen adaptation, ""The Ape"" (1940) makes a better Karloff vehicle than Monogram's dreary ""Mr. Wong"" series. If you must see this Poverty Row quickie, try to find a good quality print."
3,Oversimplifies to point of sometimes being wrong,"For the most part, Kurose and Ross do a decent job of discussing networks and expanding your knowledge. However, some information they oversimplify to the point of being wrong. For instance, in their discussion of sequence number and acknowledgement generation they break down the TCP 3-way handshake and how data transfer impacts acks. Unfortunately, they fail on how FIN impacts these computations. There are more situations like this in the book, such as IP offsets. It is as if you were putting together a jigsaw puzzle. However, someone has trimmed some of the more intricate pieces, in an attempt to facilitate the puzzle being put together a little quicker. Unfortunately, this action has robbed you of some important details of the picture, and in the end it confuses the situation rather than bringing clarity."
2,you get what you pay for,"I am unhappy with purchase, they claim to be universal but they are too small to be installed on my 2011 Silverado correctly. If your ok with them being installed and not sitting flush with this vehicle then they arent bad for the money. They do look cheap but if you dont care about looks they are ok. I returned item 10 days ago and I am still waiting for a refund."
3,dont use ratchet,I did not get directions so someone put a ratchet rope on mine and 2 broke...and we had to cut down the black liner part to fit the Ford 150 truck upon installation...but other than that it was good until I found a better one.I found a better unit at napa for a little less. Plus I was sent one that had been opened so apparently someone else had trouble fitting it in the truck holes like we did.You are only supposed to use bungie cords with the napa brand...it came with directions. That advice would be good for this product on amazon. I didn't know where to buy it so I was happy to get something fast online.
4,Geared for drivers,"This handy travel guide is definitely geared for automobile drivers. I was in Provence on a bicycle trip, so I did not find the book as useful as I desired. The book did a grand job of overviewing the entire area; unfortunately, I was only cycling in a small section of Provence and was looking for more detail on the five cities I cycled to. The index was handy and the tabbed sections made information easy to look up and scan. Overall, there were a lot of highlights but not enough substance for my specific vacation needs."
1,Warning - this guide only covers WESTERN Provence,"This guide says it is for Provence. This is absolutely NOT the case. If you are going to be in the western part of Provence (Toulon and points west) I am sure it is great. If you are going to be anywhere else in Provence, this guide will not cover that area. I have always been a fan of Michelin guides but I am extremely disappointed with this one."
5,"This Gospel Groove's , Ride's, and ""Gets Sweeter with Time""","Like Candy! Sometimes Sweet, Sometimes Hard, Other times Soft. One of the Best Traditional Gospel Groups of All-Times. A thing you can count on(CONVICTION)in the words they sing. God Bless All our Young musicians, but Most just don't have the Conviction! This Album sings of the GOOD GRACE and PROMISES of GOD! Wonderfully Re-Mastered from the Original recording, makes this a keeper. Enjoy! (ScottyG. knows Good-Music)!!!"
4,Rivera is a dance machine...,"I don't know how he does it, but Robbie Rivera manages to keep over an hour's worth of music driving and interesting without much vocal at all. His progressive stuff is funky, hard and unique all at once. I'm a big vocal dance music fan, so for him to keep me coming back for yet another CD of his is incredible. This 2 disc set is yet another really pumpin mix by the man. Check out the time listing:CD11. one eye shut (6:51)2. Shake it (6:21)3. God's funk (5:16)4. This is not rock & roll (7:06)5.

3,Mechanic/ Sniper/Off Roader,"This was a very good movie. Billy Zane's witty humor along with his knowledge of cars makes this movie very enjoyable. Get this flick if you like cars high speeds (Mach 2), and humorous insight overall. -BIG TRU"
2,For a select few who want to make fun of a terrible movie.,"Wow, what a terrible movie. However, a friend and I wanted this movie because we caught it late night on tv and had to be able to see it again for the sheer amusement. When I say ""amusement,"" I'm not talking about the kind you'd experience from Star Wars or Jurassic Park or the like. I'm talking about the kind you'd get from watching an ill-cast, poorly written, horrbly filmed piece of junk concerned with a so-called sport that nobody knows or cares about. Billy Zane's wardrobe is foolish. Large aviator glasses, a knitted yarn scarf and huge 80's style headphones. Pathetic. But hey, William Zabka has a cameo. He's the kid from the evil dojo who wants to creamate Daniel San in the original Karate Kid. What more could you ask for. Well, maybe a shotgun for after the movie."
5,CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT THE FLOPPY,"I purchased a less expensive item similar to this one however, what I found out was that the darn thing wouldn't stretch over the larger shopping carts. So, I took it back and put out the $$ for the floppy. I should have in the first place. Not only does it take care of my son in grocery or department store carts, but the restaurant high chairs as well. It also keeps them from trying to put their mouths on the cart handles. I couldn't bear to put him in a cart or highchair without protection from other icky germy kids. One thing however, is that it should be washed after each use. Especially after seeing the report on the Phoenix news about the germ tests done on grocery carts where they found more evidence of salmonella on the cart handles than bad germs from the restrooms. I'm sure this is from picking up meat packages, etc. Bottom line, I love it and so does my son. It will make a wonderful baby shower gift."
5,Love It,"My daughter received this as a Christmas gift, and we love it. I just put her in the shopping cart seat for the 1st time last week, and sure enough her mouth went right for the handle. Luckily I had the Floppy Seat cover on it. She is 7 months old and loves the bright colors and the toys we hook onto the loops. It also fits over a wide variety of public highchairs as well."
5,Awesome product!,"My 6th month old is too big for the carrier, plus he sits up well without support. This product is great for him, he can play without me having to worry about the germs of the cart, plus the padding is great for babies too. I wouldn't go out without it! Worth every penny!"
2,The buggy bagg is better,I purchased the floppy seat for my daughter about 3wks ago and I fond it very hard to use with one hand. So I did some research online and found the buggy bag. I used it one time and loved it. It is very easy to use while holding my daughter. She likes it too. It is very soft and comes with a pillow and pockets to put stuff in.
2,Buggy Bagg is Much Better!,"I got both this shopping cart cover and the Buggy Bagg cover as gifts before my child was born. I decided to keep both, one for each car. Well after several uses with each I have to say that the Buggy Bagg is far superior to the Floppy. It has more cushion and covers the cart handle completely. The Floopy is very hard to set up with just one hand, actually impossible for me! The Buggy BAgg is a breeze to set up. I would highly reommend the Buggy Bagg cover over the Floopy seat cover. It is worth every penny of the cost!!"
2,not for one hand,"This seat does do a great job at cushioning and fully covering shopping carts (even big ones) and highchairs. BUT it is not the easiest thing to use. I cannot put in on easily with one hand while holding my baby and I really cannot get it in and out of the ""pouch"" without a struggle. It is fine when my husband is with me so one of us can do it with two hands. On a rainy day, I end up lugging the unfolded seat and my baby and purse into a store and then clumsily set the seat cover up while balancing my son. I do like it once it is on but honestly tend to leave it in the car because it is such a hassle to set up."
5,Awesome Product,"My husband looked at me as though I had 2 heads when I brought this home when our son was only a couple of months old. Now he loves it!! As any of us with babies know, they touch everything and put it, or their hands in their mouths.The floppy seat is great for grocery shopping, or if you enjoy dining out as we do, you can't beat it."
3,** A MUST HAVE ITEM**,"This item is a must have for every mommy. My husband purchased this for our first son when he was 6 months old. We keep in the back of our car for shopping trips and eating out. Our oldest is now 2 1/2 and still puts his mouth on everything, a habit we're trying to break. It puts my mind at rest knowing that he's not ingesting all sorts of germs when he does it. If the seat gets grimy while eating, all you have to do is through it in the wash. The only reason that this is not getting five stars from me is the fact that ours didn't come with a carrying case, and it is a bit wild to carry around because of that."
4,The best-kept secret of the baby industry!,"I had to look long & hard to find the floppy seat! It is not widely sold in stores at the moment. I had to literally stop a woman in a grocery store to ask her where she got one and what it was called. We found a need for it once baby started sitting up and was outgrowing the infant carrier- but he was still too small to comfortably sit in shopping carts and restaurant high chairs. The seat offers a bit of cushion, safety (with the adjustible belt), and hygene, since it prevents baby from being able to lean forward and put her mouth all over the dirty shopping cart. It also has a handy pocket to put a bottle or some teether toys next to baby.I've been very happy with the floppy seat and we take it everywhere. I gave it only 4 stars, however, because it only comes in one fabric style and I believe it is a bit overpriced for such a low-tech, albeit innovative, item."
1,Don't waste your $$$$,"This Floppy Seat was a terrible waste of $$$$. It is very cumbersome to get on to the shopping cart & the very 1st time I washed it, it came apart. It is obviously made very cheaply & not worth the money.Take my advice & don't waste your time or $$$$!"
1,NOT SAFE...DO NOT BUY!!!,"I loved this for about 3 months until I realized how unsafe it was when my 9 month old son fell out of the cart. Thankfully he was not seriously hurt. This has a saftey belt for the seat cover but there is no way for the seat cover to attach to the buggy. You need to by a ""buggy bagg"". I found one for $52 online with no shipping charge. They are more expensive but it has a strap to attach it to the buggy, a strap to go around the child and velcro that attaches around the bar between their legs. It is worth the extra money not to have your child fall out."
1,Please be very careful!!!!,"I was very excited to use this product. My 9 month old has been very sick and I was thinking this would be a way of cutting down on the amount of germs to which she is exposed. I am very careful about reading all directions and being cautious with everything she does. I read the directions and installed the Floppy Seat into the grocery cart. We were shopping and my daughter reached for a pear. I moved the cart just a touch away from the pear display and turned to respond to a question asked by a person next to me and I heard a thud and looked and my daughter was no longer in the cart, but lying on the ground. Luckily after an evaluation by the paramedics and a head CT, all she is left with is a large bruise on her face. I had a sense of security that was false and my small one paid the price. I don't feel confident in recommending this product as it is now."
5,One of the few things you MUST have!,"We got a LOT of stuff for our first baby and this is one of the few things we have used on a daily basis. There are a lot of similar products but none of them match the simplicity and quality fo the Floppy Seat. We especially like to use it for the disgusting high chairs in restaurants (they never clean those) and the germ-filled, wet, hot or cold shopping carts. Someone in another review said they had a hard time getting it in the shopping cart with one hand, but it's really not that hard once you use it a few times."
3,floppy seat flaw,"This product is a great invention. It works great in high chairs at restaurants and in shopping carts at the store. It also folds up nicely into its own little pouch with handles so it can easily be stored in your trunk. There is one flaw however. When the floppy seat is unfolded and in use, my daughter's legs always get stuck in the handles because the manufacturer sews them on right where my little girls legs go through the shopping cart. It drives me nuts. I stuff the handles back in their pouch but they don't stay. It's inevitable that her legs will get tangled up when we use this product. Hopefully they will revamp the design in a new model, and sew the handles to the back or side of the floppy seat."
1,This product was way too large and annoying!,I tried four different cart covers in the store with my 10-month-old son. The Floppy was awful. It was just too huge! The leg holes are way too large. It was just annoying. Skip it and get either the Safari Cart Cover with Microban by Infantino ($40 BRU) or the Buggy Bagg ($60 BRU). I got the Buggy Bagg and I love it; have used it seven times in a mere two weeks. It also works as a high chair cover. It is expensive but worth the price.
2,"Nice, but glad I shopped around first...","After extensive research (both in-store and online), I made my decision for this investment. The Burdick Baby site offers a complete comparison chart of all cart covers on the market today. I chose the Buggy Bagg. It has a detachable pillow and offers the most fabric coverage to cover wherever my son wants to explore. It only takes 30 seconds to set up with one-hand operation, to fit shopping cart and highchair. I was pleasantly surprised how cushy the batting is. The Twingles site offers an ingenius tray to attach to the highchair, since most chairs don't reach the table at restaurants. It also works beautifully with the Buggy Bagg cover-These two items install very quickly without any guesswork."
5,GERM FREAKS YOU GOTTA HAVE IT!!!!!!! LOVE IT!!!!,Nothing more to say but it keeps kids 100% germ free while shopping!!! My 8 month old loves sitting in it! Washable and great!!!!!!
5,best gift ever,"While shopping one day my mother and I ran into a woman with a floppy seat and after finding out where she got it, at the time they were only available online, my mom went right home and ordered it. My son is now 14 months old and I still use it. It's fantastic. It washes up great and is the easiest thing in the world to use & my son Loves the little pocket. Its on my list of things to definatly buy for every shower. I'm so glad that Babies-R-Us is carrying it now."
5,I Love This Product!!,"I was a little wary of buying this product just because of the price tag, but when I compared it to the other shopping cart covers, this one just seemed to be a better product. After owning it for several months now, I can honestly say I'm thrilled with this cover! It is so easy to put on (although, as with any cart cover, you have to use a little strategy if you're by yourself with your little one). But it's cushy enough to be comfortable for my 12-month-old if she falls asleep in the cart. She loves the wild design of the fabric. And it stores itself as a bag. Every time I've used this, at least one person has stopped me and asked me where I found it. Oh, and you can also use it as a cover for those wooden restaurant highchairs, too. Buy this today!!!!"
5,Floppy Fan,"My husband and I sweated over paying so much money for the Floppy Seat. I'm glad to say that we have already gotten our money's worth out of it. It is SO convenient and gives me some peace of mind as far as germs and so forth. I don't like the location of the strap. I don't know if my baby is just small or what, but the strap never hits anywhere near where it should. Its so convenient, though, that I use it constantly."
4,Excellent Product!,"It is a must have item for those babies who touch everything and put their fingers right to their mouth! I agree the 1st review said barrier of all germs. We bought this when my daughter was 9 months, she is 15 months now, we are still using it to go shopping. It is definite worth to invest for a cart seat!"
5,great,"I recommend reading the first book in the series, as it sets the stage, but you don't have to. This is fantasy writing, with a fair understanding of history. It's fun reading. I found it originally at the public library. Lots of adventure and action, and suitable for teenagers, I mean teenaged boys. It's the usual Hero of the Thousand Faces plot, but well done for that. When I can find books like this, I like to read them all the way through."
3,Oriental Pop,"I really only care for the first four songs. The first three I might dance to, the fourth one I like for sentimental reasons. It was a big hit in many countries in the 70s and was sung in a number of languages. A lot of the remaining songs have a lot more Spanish than Oriental flair, even the lovely ""Nour El Ain"". The sound is heavliy synthesized and not traditional. Definitely a Pop CD."
4,A Valuable Translation,This important work of Origen set the stage for later patristic discussions regarding freedom of the will (libero arbitrio) and Paul's concept of justification. Noteworthy is that Origen wrote some 170 years before the Pelagian controversy broke out. Both Augustine and Pelagius were familiar with Origen's work on these all important topics.
2,DISAPOINTED,"i was hyped up to see this film... although filming was good, the acting and plot were very poor. it was a wast of time and definately isnt worth watching more than once... i found watching grass grow held a deeper more meaningful enjoyment than watching this film"
2,Caveat Emptor,"Let the buyer beware. ""Based on the novel"" is a remarkably loose interpretation of what one might expect. As so often in film versions of good books, the plot and characters have been radically altered to suit the vision of a director with no interest in faithful adaptation. P.D. James' novel contained no Nuclear War, almost no terrorism in England and a distinctly Christian emphasis."
2,not that great,I didn't think this movie was that great. I was looking foward to seeing Julianne Moore but she leaves pretty early into it. and the end was kind of a let down.
4,"Fascinating, until the end","This movie had an interesting concecpt. What if the world could no longer produce babies? And it did a fine job of portraying the effects. Though there really wasn't any type of explanation as to WHY no one could conceive any more. Visually, the movie is gorgeous. Its crazy and bleak all at the same time. Clive Owen gave a perfect performance. However, I have a major gripe with the ending. No spoilers here. But I mean, it just ended. And what? It sort of just leaves you hanging without hope or expectations. It jarred me from the otherwise brilliant film."
4,excellent movie,"a great movie in its own. i would say this movie is one of the few that have actually stood out to me in recent memory. it was packed with excitement, suspense, and hey it even had a good story to back it up. the only complaint i have is that the ending was kind of a cliffhanger. it seems like the movie could have been an additional 10 more minutes to actually conclude but the director kind of assumes you know what will happen. other than that the movie was great. acting was great, the special effects were great, and i would even like to see a directors cut with an additional ending to it."
4,Kumare recommends,"I watched this movie because someone mentioned it in an interview. It was good, Clive Owen is a very good actor. I have liked some of his other work better. It's interesting."
5,Impactful on every level,"This film has an impact on me on every level: story, characters, visuals, action, cinematography, atmosphere.I cared about Theo and his ex-wife, the girl and her child, Jasper and his wife. I cared what happened to them. As far as film-making goes, this movie is a powerhouse. It's got some of the most intense action scenes I've ever seen filmed, and several of the best ones done in one continuous shot, which has the effect of making them seem all the more brutal and immediate."
5,Simply The Best!!!,"There is no doubt that this is one of the best on HD DVD titles from Universal next to ""Hot Fuzz"" ""Shawn Of The Dead"" ""Fast & The Furious"" and ""Fast & The Furious:Tokyo Drift"" just to name a few.The interactive features are fun and the U-Control rules!!! I know the theme of the movie is depression. But the Hi-Def Version looks and sounds excellent it's worth every dollar."
3,CHECK OUT THE NEAT LITTLE HOMAGE TO PINK FLOYD,"I found this film to be fairly good - However, I was really impressed with the short (blink and you will miss it)yet powerful visual nod to Pink Floyd....In the film, Theo goes to meet with whom I believe to be his brother (?) in order to ask him to secure transport papers for the pregnant woman...Theo's brother seems to be rather affluent - Over his shoulder, out the window in the distance you can clearly make out the iconic Battersea Power Station. And if you look closely, you can see an inflatable pig floating....This of course replcates the album cover of ""Animals"",released in 1977, Pink Floyd's follow up to ""Wish You Were Here"""
1,TERRIBLE,This movie is so bad i can't begin to tell people.It made no sense at all.Some poor girl in England is the only women left in the world that can have a baby and her water breaks while everyone is trying to kill her.People all over the world are at war for some reason and England is the last safe place on earth yet there still after her.Do yourself a favor and don't spend the 7.99 for this so called movie.It is on my top five movies of the worst i have ever seen.
1,On the HD-DVD relase,"This release doesnt play on Toshiba HD-DVD players. So if you have a Tosh better wait until they release an firmware update (I have no hope that they will be releasing one in 2-3 months).There are many other HD-DVD titles that wont play on Toshiba players, better check out before ordering one."
2,An overly praised film that does not live up to the hype,"I am scratching my head as to why so many critics jumped on the bandwagon promoting this film. Until the very end, this is a slow moving film that borrows heavily from the Handmaiden's Tale and Soylent Green. In the end, you're forced to coble together most of the character's motivations because the film spends most of its time on the chase and very little on plot. It's as if no had the time to write a complete enough backstory for this film. Consequently, you find yourself in scenes that hint of something more, but never really reach fruition. I suppose the filmmakers left it all ambiguous to seem smart, but the film becomes something of a patchwork at the end, leading you nowhere, literally out to sea."
1,Dreary and just plain boring,"This movie wants to give you a message, it really wants to give you a message. The only problem is the message is not even worth getting. I personally think it would be a great thing if women became infertile for 20 years. Our population is out of control, why is it a bad thing exactly? Why are they so concerned about immigration and getting the illegals out of each country? They never explain the need to rid each country of illegal immigrants. Why would you be concerned w/ immigrants in 2027 when we do nothing about them now? They never explain why this is especially a problem. The violence is completely unnecessary. Why would the world turn increasingly more violent if women were infertile? The movie never explains this. In fact, this movie never explains anything and you're left thinking why did I even bother watching this nonsense for 2 hours?? It's not even the type of thing that makes you think, wow this could happen. It's just bleak and poorly done overall."
5,Awesome!! Keeps you interested and leaves you wanting more. Great SciFi/Action yet it makes you think.,"Awesome!! Keeps you interested throughout the whole movie and leaves you wanting more. Great SciFi/Action and though it' SciFi, it makes you think. I personally think it's an excellent movie with a great plot, great acting, great special effects/images. Very underrated."
5,WOW,"To me, this is probably the best film I have seen in years. This film has it all. Superb cast, mesmerizing cinematography and most important of all...a thought provoking script. I have watched it many times. Buy the DVD and check out the extra features. I couldn't believe that there was so much about this film that I totally missed until I watched the commentary."
1,Buyer beware: defective Universal HD-DVD discs...,"Fantastic movie, the film itself is five-stars; great acting, intriguing and imaginative script, well-directed... all in all, intelligent, mature science fiction made by grown-ups for for grown-ups.The one star is for the disc itself; owners of Xbox 360 HD-DVD drives (and stand-alone players, as well), beware, Universal has been releasing defective HD-DVD / DVD combo discs of late; ""Smokin Aces"", ""Children of Men"", ""Hollywoodland"", ""The Good Shepherd"" etc. Smokin Aces actually killed my xbox 360, which I had to send in to for repairs. These discs sporadically work, freeze, or, in my case, can actually kill your player. I am far from the only one with these issues, as there are many bloggers out there confirming similar problems. Universal has recently acknowledged the problem and say they are investigating the matter. Nevertheless, Buy at your own risk..."
1,Utterly Senseless Garbage,"This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time (and I've seen ""Southland"" with Dwayne Johnson). Rather than repeat what others have already said, let me raise one plot point which makes no sense to me. Early in the movie a big deal is made about the need for the protagonist to obtain two travel passes so he can escort a girl from London to Brighton. This is a fascist dystopia with strict travel control regulations, let us not forget. So Clive Owen's character visits his rich influential brother to ask for the really big favor of obtaining two travel passes.The next thing we see is Clive, the girl and 3 other people heading down the road in a car. Did the extra 3 people somehow get travel passes, too? We never find out because no word is ever again spoken about travel passes. The characters spend the rest of the film driving all over the south English countryside without any concern about travel passes. What did I miss here?"
2,A lot of potential,"Good director, decent story, interesting ideas, good actors. That's about it though. This movie can't seem to figure itself out. I like movies that make the viewer think, but this movie had too much extra junk thrown in the audience's face. It didn't need all the conflict, ridiculous and comical chase sequences, and near-death experiences. The jump-start escape scene was laughable and the point where this film went downhill. Julianne Moore is a fine actress but can't play this role in which she was cast. Do they think a nose ring can instantly turn her into a rebel? I give it 2 stars because, like I said, I like movies that make the viewer think, but this one ended 20 minutes into it for me."
1,So Awful,DarkDepressingVisually unappealingJust a waste of time and money.I'm sticking to Netflix so I can indiscriminately turn crap off.
1,Don't bother....,Who knew the apocalyptic future could be so talky and BORING??? If this is the future-we're all going to bore one another to death.
1,Children of Men,"When my video came I was anxious to listen to it, but to my surprise it skipped so badly that I returned it to you and as yet haven't received another copy. I can't rate this as it was so bad I wasn't able to enjoy it. Please send me another that is undamaged so that I may enjoy watching it. Thank youI am sure that you won't be printing this review."
1,"Great movie, but .....",Great movie but it does not include either spanish audio or spanish subtitles in HD version. What is happening with Universal Studios? Why do they include spanish subtitles in SD version and not in HD version. It stinks.
2,"slow, boring, waste of time","Why bother writing a review for this movie.It was slow, boring, anti-climatic, and dull. Took way to long to really get anywhere; and once you finally get there....ehhhh."
2,"Intrigueing idea, lackluster execution","Starting off well, I was settling in for a nice, old-school dystopia movie. Although having some nice characters outlined, the movie really never went anywhere and just got bogged down in recyling violence after awhile. Most shockingly was the cop-out ending that couldn't even give a face to or a creative explanation for the ""Human Project"" or whatever it was called. Quite disappointed they couldn't even put a mildly stimulating story behind the idea (well, they couldn't even give a reasonable explanation for the TOTAL sterility, that was lame too)."
3,Why the hype?,"I saw the movie recently but didn't like it. Sorry. There was too much pointless violence and the escapes from the authorities just weren't believable.The biggest flaw, however was the setting. How could economies in such a world be in bad shape? If children just stopped being born for twenty years economic conditions would not deteriorate but would greatly improve, especially in the third world. Not only would the ratio of dependents-to-workers fall but the ratio of humans-to-resources would also fall. (I, personally, would not trade fatherhood for a higher standard of living. I think that few fathers would.)Also, it doesn't makes sense that everybody would want to emigrate to England unless the infertility crisis hit the first world while sparing the third world.I gave it a 3 instead of a 2 because Michael Caine as the aging boomer/hippie was great and because the teenage boy in me was entertained by all the car chases."
4,Recommended Viewing,"While the 'cautionary tale' plot of 'Children of Men' may bore some, this film is far and away the best directed motion picture since 'Munich' -- and I say this with my sincerest apologies to Mr Lee and Mr Scorsese who both directed fine pictures in 'Brokeback Mountain' and 'The Departed' respectively but who broke new ground in neither. Simply put, the storytelling on showcase in 'Children of Men' is nothing short of breathtaking.4.5 STARS... I was thoroughly engrossed every second of the film... but the over-all story feels a bit out-dated."
2,Not the best,"I had heard from a few people that this was a great movie. I disagree. Previews looked good but the movie was slow going, and didn't make me think at all. It was like listening to someone tell you everything they did in a week at their boring job."
2,A disappointment,"A visually stunning, plot-less waste of time. The story should have been interesting but the trailers were much more entertaining than the movie. The whole premise could have made a great movie. As it stands, you spend the entire movie thinking of other things. It just won't hold your attention. This movie is not worth $5 let alone the $20 I paid for it."
2,Beware: this disc will not play on Toshiba hd-dvd players,"I purchased this hd-dvd disc, and I can't get it to play on my Toshiba HD-DVD player...(Bummer). Be careful if you'r ordering this title on HD-DVD."
2,"How, why, what, huh?","I was just waiting for this one to come out on DVD. Voila! It's here and I rent it. God, oh God, oh God - this film had so much potential and super actors, but the story was so full of holes, I could've drained my spaghetti in it! Not one single question regarding the plot of the film was answered!!! Not a single one! Since I refuse to watch it again, I now have to go to bed asking myself if I didn't perhaps miss something.Let's go on the record here: Acting - superb (Michael Caine's still got it); filming - superb; suspense - superb; action -superb; plot - as weak as my overcooked spaghetti. Everything was there but the plot. Like having my palate whet, without ever tasting the dish. Frustrating, hmmm?"
2,Disappointed viewer,"I was totally let down. Since I had read the book, I could not wait to see the movie. Bad Move! The book was very thought provoking, but the screen version did not follow the story line at all. I had to force myself to finish watching it. Don't waste your time or money"
5,Phenomenal,"This movie is phenomenal. It blew me away. My husband and I rate it in our top 5 of all-time. It really is cinema genius the way this movie was put together. Just because the movie did not give you a happy ending or perfectly tied up all open-ended questions when it ended is no reason to tear it apart. I think the people knocking this movie are probably the same people who enjoy ""Scary Movie"" and ""White Girls"".Don't miss this movie."
3,Feedback on your video streaming process,"This is the second download I have tried with you guys and the downloading process is terrible. I spent over an hour trying to get it downloaded still I have not been able to finish watching it. Also i was charged three times for the single download of this film, what gives? I'm very disappointed with the downloading process. This is not like you guys to provide this level of poor quality service. Please advise. thanksMal Bowen"
5,Stunning,"The story is great. The camera work is very original - you feel like everything thats happening to its characters is happening to you. There are no special effects which is rare nowadays. Real explosions, real gunfire and so on... Actors did a great job. Most importantly this movie was highly believeable. No nonsense that left me going ""oh come on.. give me a break"" (and I'm that kind of a guy). I really felt for the characters and got attached to them. The atmosphere alone was unbelieveable -- a cold, dark, dead near-future -- kind of like the game HL 2 when you first get off the train (if you've ever played it). This movie definitely leaves you with something to remember."
3,"Great acting, but plot has BIG holes.","I really thought the characters were believable and the sets were great. The problem came from the motivations of why people were doing what they were doing. It made no sense for the government to try to deport people from a country whose population was becoming rapidly depleted. If sterility was rampant, wouldn't the gov try to bring in as many women from all over the world as possible and test for feritilty??? This is a big logic flaw. And low and behold, it IS in immagrant who becomes preggers. The point is that the whole thing is so metaphorical that the plot is unrealistic. (The Messege: Left/Right Politics have become ""sterile"" We need to get beyond what we know, go out into the fog, to ""catch the ship of tomorrow"") Bleh. What makes the film interesting are the characters created by the actors and the cinenatography, which is excellent."
3,Good Movie....Disturbing Premis.,"I watched the movie last night on DVD and found it fascinating, but also quite disturbing and depressing.The movie grabbed my attention from the opening scene, and quickly transported me to a dark ""near future"" that was full of pain, fear and despair. It's not exactly an uplifting film! I guess what is most disturbing about this film, is that the premis is not that far fetched and almost plausable. Great acting, direction and set design make this movie realistic and quite believable.Other reviewers have commented that the film ends on an uplifting and postive note, but I didn't feel that way when the movie ended. Maybe that's why I only gave it three stars. Does anyone really feel good after watching a movie so negative and bleak about future of humanity?Mike"
1,terrible,"This is a dreary and unimaginative movie. Superbly incompetent screenplay. Wanton and pointless violence.In short, not worth watching, let alone buying."
1,The most boring movie I've ever ATTEMPTED to watch...,"What a waste of movie rental money. I kept waiting and waiting for it to get good, and it never came."
5,The Director was Superb!,"I loved this movie for a couple of reasons.1) The director incorporated the song ""In the Court of the Crimson King"" into the sound track.2) Shortly after the King Crimson song. Theo and his cousin are standing in front of some large plate glass windows. Outside the windows, the background looks exactly the same as the cover of Pink Floyd's ""Animals"" album. I think I'm one of the few who caught that.Can't wait for more from Alfonso Cuaron."
3,Kind of drawn out!!,This was a very confusing movie and very drawn out....find it hard to proceive!!! Hard to follow...but love Clive Owen!!!
1,Not even bad...,"In reading some of the reviews here, I think I might have seen a different film! The one I saw had only slight resemblence to the book but, even a that, a knowledge of the book was essential if one was to have any idea of what was going on. A sudden pregnancy is the deus ex machina which will save mankind from extincition but, if the characters in this movie are any indication, I would wonder why we would want to bother.The greatest mystery of all is how great actors such as Michae Caine and Juliana Moore could be enticed to appear it this dreary (in many respects) movie.I would have walked out early on but it was so bad that I kept thinking that it had to get better. So much for that logic..."
5,Unforgettable,"I was amazed by the emotional power of this film. I cried several times and not just when someone died. Several reviews expressed a desire to know why the women in the film were infertile. The film would have been far less effective if the mystery had been fully explained. How many women today are able to pinpoint a concrete reason for their infertility? Without a specific medical problem, individuals experience the level of despair mixed with hope that the entire society in this film was experiencing. If this film was nothing more than a comment on the emotional impact of infertility, it would be enough. Thankfully, this film is much more, and I can't recommend it highly enough."
4,"Very different from the book, but still a good movie","I saw the movie first - and really enjoyed it. The whole premise and genre were right up my alley. Then I read the book and was shocked by how much the two stories differ. But, I enjoyed both versions of the story immensely.To me, the movie is a bit more on the dark and gritty side, but the book has it's dark moments as well. If you're into end of the world as we know it type stories, then I would recommend you give this a try. If you enjoy the movie, read the book for a slightly different take on the story."
4,Worth Owning!,"The only reason I rated this movie a 4 is the sound isn't that great on the DVD. Ihad to pull a chair up close to the TV to hear it. But the movie itself is thoughtprovoking, I was drawn into the story and believed it and loved the ending. Theaction is quick paced and depicts the chaos of the time period."
3,"Movie is INCREDIBLE, HD DVD is busted.","I love the movie, and up until about half way through it, I was saying ""Wow, I'm really glad we got this, it looks fantastic.""...15 minutes later, I got the ""408bc504"" error (search for it) on my Toshiba HD-A2. We had to watch the rest of the movie in SD, which is ironic, because I'd guess that the reason there are errors with the media is because they attempted to press both formats on the same disc.Apparently Universal is replacing the discs for people with this error, which is nice, but it may be that you don't want to take the chance with this one quite yet? SO unfortunate, because it looked so nice when it was playing. :/Buyer beware? wait a few months, or just be prepared to watch the last 1/4 in SD... it's almost worth it."
2,"Not Bad, but Not Great either","Children of Men transports us to the year 2027 where the world has not experienced a new birth in 18 years due to mass human infertility. As a result, people have lost hope and have turned violent. Suddenly, a pregnant woman capable of producing life appears out of nowhere and the chase is on...In short, the acting is pretty good (but nothing wonderful), the plot is quite interesting, while the dialogues are average and sometimes below average.In a nutshell, it's probably not a movie you would want to add to your collection, but it might provide for an evening's entertainment, and that's about it; it lacks that extra something to put it over the top. No masterpiece here."
3,Bad Sound Editing,"The story is a neat idea, but the bad sound editing made it difficult for me to understand much of the dialogue.Very realistic look at how bleak the future could be in this apocalyptic movie. Well done, but not being able to understand the dialog turned a good story into blehh...Watch it with the sound turned up. Could barely hear it."
1,Religious propaganda,I don't see the point of this movie. Its all about people freaking out because there were no children. I don't see what the big deal is. So what if its the end of the human race? I didn't feel sympathy for any of the characters.
1,Waste of time,"All I can say is ""Waste of time."" I didn't get it. The movie just ended and nothing was explained. A dud!"
1,DO NOT READ THE BOOK!,"If you have read ""The Children of Men"" by P.D.James, then DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM, because you will hate the movie.If you have watched this film, then DO NOT READ THE BOOK, because you will hate the movie.This is one of the few times where a flimatic tragedy was created from a great source of material. The only reason this film deserves one star is because of the fine acting."
2,A glimpse at a bleak future and thats it.,"If a movie could be a pointless short story this would be it.As the movie got going and established its setting and storyline, it ended. I couldn't help but ask... ""so what?"" At the end.I think the storyline had huge potential and I think the setting was great! The setting is the only reason I can give this movie two stars. The director sufficiently convinced me of the hopelessness of mankind in that situation. Its too bad that he could not accomplish more with the potential he had.There has been a lot of stock put into the depth of this movie. I have to say that other than the depravity of man there is nothing the movie has to say on any subject. I think other movies more skillfully paint that picture, such as Blood Diamond.I guess this movie is worth renting but I do not reccommend purchasing it."
1,One of the worst movies I have ever seen,"The acting is laughable, the pacing is slow, there are ridiculous scenes like when the guy has bullets zinging around his head but does not move, and it goes nowhere. Hard to stuff up a compelling idea but Cuaron manages it easily."
2,Dull - - I walked out,"The movie tries to be Very Relevant And Topical by littering the scenery with terrorists and mistreated immigrants. The director obviously took a how-to-film-a-bleak-dystopia course at a community college, so the mise-en-scene is properly gray and gritty. But the movie is enough of a hack job, the premise dull and the characters hollow, that my internal alarm ""this movie is never going to get anywhere"" started ringing really loud after ten minutes. When that happens I give it ten more minutes to show some promise. It didn't. *click*"
3,Children of Men,The menu screen was printed in Slavic so it took forever to figure out how to turn off the foriegn subtitles. I've learned never to buy DVD's from the Net.
3,"worth watching, though flawed",Flaws first: They could have cast anyone in the role played by Julianne Moore and Michael Caine; there is no explanation for the pandemic of infertility or for the hatred of refugees and immigrants.What's worth watching: the other actors give strong performances; the production design and camera work are stunning; the self-administered euthanasia pill called Quietus is a nice touch.
2,Someone Tell Me Again Why We Want To Save Mankind?,"I haven't been able to watch this whole movie in one piece. It's so DEPRESSING!! Dark, dank, filthy cities, slave-drivers or something brutally treating people as they have since the beginning of time! Who in their right mind wants such a cruel species to survive?I'm slogging through the book which is very over written. I think I'm at pg. 47 and something is finally beginning to happen, but I find it very hard to pick up the book each time.You just look at the state of the world today: Kenya hacking hundreds of people to death over a political result that may not end for decades,African genocides that have become national pastimes, terrorists,etc, ad nauseum! If you want a true state of mankind, rent or buy the outstanding ""Lord of War.""There's a pretty big asteroid headed towards us next month. I think I'm rooting for the asteroid."
5,Beyond a Film,"This film is amazing for so many reasons. Foremost being it has one of the most powerful cinematographic visual strategies that I've seen in a long, long time. Extremely well-shot but executed in a manner that doesn't call attention to itself like most visually-driven films. Acting and script are understated yet excellent as well. If this film doesn't make it to the top of every best film list this year then the critics need to think about a career change."
5,Amazingly Underrated,I had to view this film for a class and was prepared to be bored for nearly 2 hours. As soon as the first bomb went off this movie had me hooked. I loved this film. It made me laugh at the great chemistry between Clive Owens and Michael Caine as well as Clive Owens and the lead girl. It made me cry Michael Caine's beautiful move to save mankind. I can't believe I did not see this movie sooner. It is wonderfully made with great close ups and use of sound. I highly recommend this movie to anybody no matter what genre of film that appeals to them. Wonderful job!
2,huge disappoinment,This movie was dark and predictable. It has been compared to Blade Runner and this is a travesty. I would not waste the money on purchasing this movie
3,"Liked the movie, loved the book","I liked the movie, but I don't understand why the director deviated so much from the plot-line and characters in the book. I read the book after seeing the movie and I was shocked at how different they were. I liked the story-line in the book a lot more than the movie - especially the ending."
5,Hated it at first but now LOVE it.,"When walking out of the movie theater, I was confused and hated this movie. By the time I got to my car, I had plenty of time for the movie to soak in and I actually liked it. By the time I got home, I loved this movie. Give it a chance and keep your mind open and you'll like this movie as much as I do."
3,Something is missing,"I had great expectations after reading some of the ***** reviews and I was a bit disapointed.Promising story(I won't repeat it, you can find it in the other reviews), very good acting, a bit of humor, not exactly science-fiction as some characterized it, a bit of action-enough to prevent you fall asleep, the old story about the sceptic who doesn't want to get involved and in the end saves the world, however when it ends you ask yourself-what is missing to make it a great movie? I'll let you decide by yourself."
1,Another Shaky Camera,"This is another in the latest style of movie making - idiotic hand-held camera. Many of the scenes are so shaky they made me dizzy. I'll never understand why any director would think this is so cool. To me, it destroys the movie. Also, the story made no sense."
1,Unwatchable,My wife and I were shocked at just how bad this movie really was....we lasted about 20 mins and then it had to be turned off.
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"I rented this movie from pay per view and I'm glad I didn't spend more on it. It has to be one of the worst movies I've seen recently. Besides being very dreary and depressing, it quickly deteriorated into another trite chasing and shooting guns movie. I'm so tired of movies with ridiculously unrealistic gun shooting. There was also very little story and character detail, you have to know what the story is about ahead of watching it."
1,Terrible movie,"Liberal bleeding heart crapper. Horrible acting and completely nauseating. Worst film I have seen in years. Do not see this film, save your money."
2,"So, so, so boring","This movie is a waste. I am a fan of the novel, but not the movie version. It is a poor representation of the message contained within the original work. It had potential, but potential that was unfullfilled. Skip it!"
2,Wow...not good at all,"I'm giving this two stars because if you are even considering this movie, then you just might like it a bit. Good cast, good production value. Potentially interesting story but also flaky...and it's pretty much a one trick pony...no more kids, bleak future, blah...The ending is by far the worst part, but the 20 mins that precedes it is equally as bad (downright ridiculous imho). My wife couldn't watch the whole thing, and I didn't even pressure her to stay.I know there isn't much substance to this review...but trust me, this one is a stinker."
3,Overrated,"Interesting film but wildly overrated by the critics. Confusing and ambiguous story line trips up a pretty good cast and produces a mediocre science fiction film. I am afraid that all this film really foreshadows is more bad movies to come. This film does not, by any stretch of the imagination, compare to Sci-Fi classics like Blade Runner. Save your money and watch it on cable."
2,Read the book first,"I should have read the book first. Everything was moving so fast including violence, gore and subplots I just was overwhelmed. Perhaps because it seemed everyone had a gun and wanted to wontonly shoot everyone else, it reminded me of the unpleasantness in the war we are currently trying to disengage ourselves from. I think subtleness is an art and this movie lacks it entirely. Everything is just exploded on the screen to jar us into senselessness. I think if the government plot was more elaborate it will have alientated me less. I am off to buy the book."
1,Truly Evil.,"Note the warning: ""Consumption may cause stomach discomfort and/or a laxative effect."" From personal experience, I can say that this product is truly evil and I really wouldn't recommend it even to my worst enemy. I'm of fair health and didn't expect that a product released by a reputable company would have side-effects so strong and unpleasant. Gross."
4,ANOTHER CLASSIC EURO-DANCE ALBUM FROM BBB !,"THIS ALBUM IS ANOTHER CLASSIC FROM THE MASTERS OF EUROPEAN DISCO - ""BAD BOYS BLUE"". YES THEY'VE DONE IT AGAIN!!! IT'S A MUST HAVE ALBUM FOR EVERYONE HOW LIKES SOFT DISCO EUROSOUND. I STILL WISH THEY WOULD MAKE IT SOUNDS MORE LIKE IT WAS 14 YEARS AGO - A LITTLE LESS ELECTRONIC."
3,"Sorry, only average!","I must admit, I was a little disappointed with this alnum from the Boys. I have been a big fan for many years and have all thier albums but, in my view, they seem to have lost the plot with this record. However, track number 2 entitled: ""Thinking About You"" is pretty fab, and I would say that it is a worthwhile investment for that track alone!"
2,So So,"I don't have this album but my sister does and I've listened to it. The only songs that I think it's worth listening to are tracks 1,2,3,5, & 9. As for the remaining tracks, I didn't like the lyrics or the rhythm because they don't blend well with each other. Not only that, but I can hear it in the lead singer's voice that his heart wasn't really into these songs except for those 5 mentioned above. I've listened to their Super 20 and Continued album and I must say both of these are far better than this one. Thank goodness I didn't buy it."
4,perfect for a 4 year old's imagination,"my son loves his ""fire guy"" set. he's only four and spends hours dressed up and playing. the missles on the gloves don't really shoot but rather just kind of fall out. in other words, they don't go very far at all. sound quality from the gloves is pretty good. mask looks weird but who cares, my son likes it. overall, i guess it was worth it but i could have waited until it was on clearance."
5,Fat Men From Space,"Let me put this simply. This is the best kid's book evar! I read it over and over and over as a child. It probably influenced me more than I can imagine. It's a must read for everyone. And truthfully, I still read it."
4,Oldie but Goodie,I rememeber reading this book when I attended Elementary School back in the 80's. I got this for my 8-year old and he enjoyed it.
2,Not as good as I expected,"This book was really boring and childish. It was a real disappontment to me because I know Mr.Pinkwater can do a much much better job writing than he did in this book. I wouldn't really recommend this to readers, unless they are younng and really love corny books like this one."
2,Not as Good as it Looks - Could be better,"This product has 2 serious design flaws - it's flimsy AND the upper towel bar (not the shelf) should stick out more.I bought this based on it's great looks and the reviews. However, I must go against the crowd on this one. I would have paid $10 for the exact same thing in a thicker gauge steel. Yes i did mount them securely with the proper wall anchors. They flex more than I expect out of a towel bar and they have a very cheap, hollow sound.I bought this in place of a double towel bar. The upper towel bar sticks out only 1"" more than the lower, hence the towels are close together and take longer to dry.It still looks good, I just don't know how long they will last or it's flimsiness drives me to rip it out from the wall.I would not buy them again."
5,Good quality,Had one of these in my old house. It stayed rock solid for 11 years. Never loosened up and always worked. Never rusted. What more can I say?
4,Nice and sturdy towel rack with reasonable price,"My husband and I are both satisfied with the towel rack. Its design is similar to the towel rack we saw in hotels. It is sturdy, stylish and functional. Strongly recommeded!"
4,Aesthetic and Practical Bathroom Towel Rack,"My wife and I use this towel rack in our master bathroom. During the cooler months of the year, normal towel racks do not allow enough ventilation to dry the towels before we use them again. The design of this towel rack allows the rear towel to dry completelywhen you drape it over the two lower bars, reducing the mildew smell that occurs on towels left damp. This towel rack is also very attractive. We really like it and this is our second purchase of the rack to be installed in our second bathroom."
4,content is alright... but the pictures are fabulous...,the exercises are quite alright... useful to say... the pictures and the layout is really very attractive... easy to read and to understand... good book overall
3,For the Fans is only the Box,"Para los amigos de habla hispana, realmente si eres fans de Maiden, lo mas seguro es que ya tengas en distintos bootleggs las canciones que esta caja o ""cofre "" contiene, aparte del buen gusto del pergamino, anillo, vaso y caja tendras el gusto de reunir todo este material en una sola parte de tu casa, el precio,,, bueno, no es el mas barato pero antes de comprar el KISSKASKET, esta es definitivamente la oportunidad de unirte para gritar Ups the Irons. Desde Chile un abrazo"
5,"Reviewer ""FIshcake"" is an idiot!!! Iron Maiden Rules!!!!!!","Don't be fooled by useless reviews from people like ""Fishcake"" found on this list! Iron Maiden always has been at the top of the metal game. They are living legends and are still putting out quality music...quality metal. How many bands can pull it off with 3 guitarists? Any true fan of metal or Maiden will want this box and will gain even more appreciation for what they've accomplished over the last 20 years. Up the Irons!!!"
3,Bollywood comedy set in London,"A fun Bollywood movie with some Romantic Comedy and some Family Drama and quite a bit of dancing. None of the dance numbers are spectacular, but are often creatively staged and costumed and (appropriately as the movie is set in London) include quite a diversity of looks among the dancers. The singing, however, is so heavily auto-tuned that the vocals might as well have been created with a synthesizer. The movie builds momentum slowly and certainly isn't one I would highly recommend, but it is a reasonable diversion and isn't one to avoid, either."
3,Good for Beginners,"The goalie shorts are ok, a little short for my liking but did the job! I would recommend these for goalies that are just starting out and want some protection."
4,Great Shorts!,"I am in All-Star Keeper U-12 and I have loved these shorts. They supply Great Padding and don't get hot at all. For me I would rather not wear Sliding shorts under them but, thats just me."
4,A nice book!!,"I have used the Live Your Calling material as a guide in my life. The answers are empirical and really helped me zero in on the vocational positions to pursue. The authors are pretty cool writers. They help you see that your calling is comprised of your values, temperament, motivational patterns, personal history, family, purpose and more. In many ways, the book is a superb complement to another book that I just read titled ""The Career Journey"" by author Ram Iyer. While ""Live Your Calling"" is focused a lot on finding the right job, ""The Career Journey"" focuses less on the finding of the job and more on what to do once you find it. Buy both together for a perfect set of books !!!"
5,A Worthwhile Book,I find this book inspiring and uplifting! A book that will touch the hearts and minds its readers! Its abundant life renewing principles are a paragon example of a worthwhile person in more ways than a million!Everyday People Making an Extraordinary ImpactSimeon Johnson
2,"Too ""Christian"" focused.","I used this book with our Quaker Meeting. Our group is not fundamentalist at all, and found that the fundamentalist/evangelical focus was much too strong for us. The non-religious assessments are good, and revealing, but the authors definitely expect readers/participants to have a ""God-focused"" perspective. Some of us do, and some of us don't, so this book is really for a limited audience."
1,not a pleased customer with this particular product,"the company saw my mailing address and still sold me two copies of the wrong region.... dvds will not play on my home, now i have to spend more money to buy two more and i lost money by buying the first two... so i am very unhappy with this purchase... how could you receive my billing and mailing address and still sell me a product that won't even work in my region."
3,The Wiz falls short,"You would think that a cast which includes the likes of Diana Ross, Michael Jackson, Lena Horne and Richard Pryor (not to mention the voices of Roberta Flack and Luther Vandross) would be spectacular. Well, I can say that The Wiz isn't that. Director Sidney Lumet tried too hard to make this an over-the top fantastical journey and it just ended up a flop. Don't get me wrong, the music is fantastic and some performances are exceptional (like Mabel King reprising her role as Evilene, the Wicked Witch of the West from Broadway) but on a whole, there's something that is missing. Diana Ross is horribly miscast and, despite all of her efforts, she is vocally inadequate when compared to, well basically everything else. This is something that everybody should see but it isn't worth money. Split the rental fare with a friend (or two). END"
3,This film doesn't stand the test of time.,"It was great to see Michael Jackson's first film role, and he was great as the Tin Man, but the film as a whole doesn't stand the test of time. Some of the dance numbers just seem to go on and on and on without moving the story forward. This type of indulgence was typical of the time in which the film was made-the 70's (very over-the-top). And, for all her talent and brilliance, (and I think she's amazing) but Diana Ross was just horribly miscast as Dorothy. Also, we buy DVD's because we want the extra's and this DVD doesn't contain any, other than the theatrical trailer, (which really isn't an extra). For a 30th anniversary re-release they should have gone back to the director or producer for commentary; or at least some of the living cast members. The digital remastering did enhance the picture quality, but over-all the film as a whole was just ""ok."" I didn't love it, but didn't hate it."
2,The Wiz,"I love Micheal Jackson and have always wanted to see this movie. To be honest it was not the greatest movie I have ever seen, but it was cute and if you like The King of Pop you will like this movie."
5,Awesome and Exciting to watch!,"The music, Micheal, Diane Ross, etc., everything was great. This is great for kids to see the other side of the Wizard of OZ. Great, musical movie."
5,Diana at her best,Mike and Diana are great together on screen. I wish they would of done another one but we all know that will never happen. The music really set the movie and I grew up loving this movie and when I got it for my 17th birthday I was very happy to own it again. My mom had it first she taped it off of the tv I guess.Great movie for all ages.
5,Great Movie.,"Nice twist on the original.....Michael and DIana are superb. I enjoyed the scene where Michael sangs ""You Can't Win"". Nippsy Russell as the tin man was an awesome idea. My favorite character was the wiz, which was played by Richard Pryor. Good family movie."
4,The Baby whisperer,"Loved this movie when it premiered .My 3 1/2 niece saw it on tv and fell in love with it as did my 18th mon. Old nephew.It gave them so much joy I purchased the DVD for them. They watch it like its the 1st time even though they watch it at least 3 times a week.it's one of the few things for which they sit still ,"
4,All time favorite,I bought this movie for my 4 year old. He loves this movie and has watched it over and over for years! This movie replaced the last DVD that he lost. He loves the scarecrow and is so impressed that Michael Jackson looks so different in this movie. I love the awesome talent of Michael Jackson and Diana Ross. I wish Michael had done more movies.
2,"A ""Wiz"" with bipolar disorder","I have not seen the stage play; but the video ""Wiz"" is very oddly paced. Far too many slow ballads in minor keys to suit my taste. Even the rockin' songs have an overload of sharps, flats and disjointed rhythms. The pacing of the music and spoken sections is far too slow to maintain interest IMO... the only section that really moves is the middle, where Dorothy is joined by her three Friends for their quest. The filmmaker has apparently become so enamored of the set design and costuming that it takes priority over telling the story. And who IS the strange, ominous stalker with the tray of odd-looking items? The song ""Ease on Down the Road"" does, however, ALMOST make up for these deficiencies :o)"
4,Very good movie,"Diana Ross was miscast as Dorothy in this movie. I thoroughly enjoyed Michael Jackson as the Scarecrow, Nipsey Russell as the Tin Man, and Ted Ross as The Lion. Lena Horne was fantastic as well. This movie is well worth the watch."
1,skipped and skipped,"July 5, 2010Since amazon asked for my review, here it is:I purchased this DVD movie about 3 weeks ago in anticipation of watching and remembering the movie I saw so many years ago...and to give it to my 6 yr old Grand-daughter as a gift.Well to my complete disappointment, the movie skipped ...and skipped ...and skipped!!!I had paid full ""new"" price for this item and expected excellent video and sound quality.I even had a bowl of popcorn ready to enjoy while watching itI do not recommmend buyers using amazon to purchase dvds--at all."
1,Doesn't work,"This DVD was coded for the UK, not America, and would not play in my DVD players. I was disappointed."
5,Love this movie,"Love This movie. Michael Jackson, Nipsey Russel, Diana Ross and the cast was great! My of my classics."
2,A numbing experience,"This was a huge disappointment for me back in 1978 and it has NOT improved with age, except for a few of the dance sequences."
1,Terrible!,"This movie loses a lot in translation into something more ""urban"". It is no longer a movie for young children as it contains visual imagery of prostitutes, drug users, and what appear to be pimps instead of horses changing colors. I actually had to cover my granddaughter's eyes while Dorothy was leaving Munchkinland to find the Yellow Brick Road, because she ended up in what appeared to be the ""Red Light District"" of Munchkinland, which is filled with graffiti and trash. This is a terrible, unnecessary remake with a mottled message."
1,SKIPPING DVD,This dvd sucked.I couldn't wait to get this DVD and watch it with my 14 year old son.. only to find it was all scratched up. Most parts skipped and others just never showed up..lol*sigh*I will try again with a BRAND NEW dvd !
3,GOOD BUT DOES'NT OUTSHINE THE ORIGANAL,"Legendary soul mega star, DIANA ROSS could'nt have seemed further from the concept of Dorothy and that is why it makes it all the more surprising that she plays the role adorably. Based on L.Frank Baums popular fantasy, The Wonderful Wizard Of Oz, this is adapted as a hip, all black version and the result is mostly good but really does'nt knock any spots off the origanal 1939 version starring Judy garland which remains unmatched. The sets are magnificent, the songs and dancing ditto and some of the performances too make this a good film.Other famous members of the cast include Michael jackson in the role of the scarecrow, Richard Pryor as The Wiz and Leena Horne as the good witch of the north. Such images of Dorothy and the scarecrow dancing down the yellow brick road whilst singing, EASE ON DOWN THE ROAD are very eye catching. A good film that has some appeal possibly to people of all ages."
4,An enjoyable film,"I've notived that a lot of people don't like ""The Wiz"". Perhaps because people keep comparing it to ""The Wizard of Oz"". Its true that they're both based upon L. Frank Baum's book, but you really have to view them seperately. The Wiz is a wonerous interpretation of the original story in that it provides an urban twist that allows modern (for the 70's anyway) youth to understand a bit more of Dorothy's plight. Its also an Afro-centric take on the theme, providing a better understanding for black children. Being a black man myself, I remember my mother playing both films for me back-to back and then having a discussion about the differences between them. And, although my favorite Oz-based film is still ""Return to OZ"", I was better able to understand that they are all good films and GREAT stories."
1,This movie is awful!,"The soundtrack is excellent! The movie is simply bad, and the sets and locations are some of the ugliest things I have ever seen. Was this entire movie shot in a garbage dump? Simply watching this thing is depressing. Do yourself a favor and watch the original with Judy Garland. It'll put a smile on your face again and again."
5,Classic,How could you not have this movie. This is so much better than the original boring The Wizard of Oz. This has more soul to it. I already have the DVD but I will be getting the 30th anniversary set. I don't care. This is Michael and Diana we're talking about.
5,In my top 5 favorite films of all times.,"I'm a midwestern small-town-white-boy, who's 43 now. I saw it in original release 21 years ago. I was so blown away I stayed in the theater & sat thru it again. It has such a uplifting, spiritual messege, seldom seen now except on Touched by an Angel. A movie that changed my life for the better."
3,uhmmmmmmmmm,"A little weird, I mostly just wanted to see Michael Jackson as a teenager doing his first movie. I loved that -seeing him sing and dance and interact. He was so talented. Why didn't we appreciate him, why didn't we reach out to him, embrace him in his later years?? Almost all geniuses tend to get a little weird when they move on from their prime and they cannot overachieve anymore, or out do what they have done. Their physical appearanace changes, new people come into the spotlight and nudge them over-it is not in their character to accept those normal life experiences. HIs brothers went on to live normal lives, but for Michael, it was not possible. Show biz WAS his link to life, he could not adapt."
1,The Wiz,"I would give this movie a negative star rating. My daughter had her classmates (middle/high school) over to watch the movie becasue their school is performing the play (when it was on Broadway it won about 10 Tony awards). The movie was worse than horrible, we all found it racist, stereotyping black people, and extremely painful to watch (not because of the material but the way it was acted and portrayed). I apologized to all the parents for wasting their kids brain cells. The kids did not like it but said they would finish watching it (I offered another movie about 45 minutes into this one which is 2 hours and 15 minutes). The music was fine but the visual detracted from it's enjoyment."
5,Great movie,"This movie takes me back to my childhood. You have to watch this one if you've seen the original, diversity is a wonderful thing."
2,Poor Picture Quality,"I read the reviews before selecting which The Wiz DVD I would purchase. I already loved the movie; so, reviews and price were my deciding factors. Now that I've purchased and viewed the 30th Anniversary Edition I think I may have gotten a dud or bootleg DVD. The picture quality was so dark throughout the entire movie. My plasma TV usually shows a bright brilliant picture, but not with this DVD. No amount of adjustments improved the picture. The original version on Netfix shows a better picture than the DVD I got. I'm going to return it for another copy. If the picture is still dark I'll request a refund."
5,Sing along but don't mind the plot,"Even though it saddens me to think that the American Black community needed to make there own version of ""The Wizard of Oz"", it clearly kicks **** over the original classic of the era.I would like to see this redone today with some big artists and not make it all black but an eclectic mix of all nations playing the roles. However all things aside - a movie of this class and statue is guaranteed to find pride of place on your DVD cabinet.Buy and enjoy a classic!"
4,Anamorphic transfer,"I own two copies of this DVD, one is Region One which I bought a few years ago and the other, Region Three which I just bought. No information is given here but do check before you buy. My Region Three DVD which has the same cover as this Region Two release is remastered in Anamorphic 16.9 Widescreen and the Region one release is not. If you have a Widescreen TV, or have the intention of buying one, you don't want the Region One release, believe me. Dance sequences as marvellous as these here are best viewed on a big screen. Not to mention Miss Ross singing her heart out in 'Home'."
4,Who needs the Wizard of Oz when you've got the Wiz!,"I love this movie (except Diana Ross)! The music is great. I love Michael singing the ""Crow Anthem"" You Can't Win & Evilene's Don't Nobody Bring Me No Bad News. But the ultimate is Can You Feel A Brand New Day. This is uplifting and the dance number is excellent! This is one of my all time favorite movies. The Wizard of Oz is a classic and I still like it, but this movie has a whole different flavor that I love! This is one to have permanently in your video collection."
1,A disaster of a film,"Thank goodness Judy Garland was not around to see this bomb. And that is exactly what it did at the box office for good reason. First and formost Ross is far too old to be playing Dorothy. An excellent cast is wasted except Michael Jackson, who somehow though this mess of a film, gives a good performance. After this turkey neither did Jackson or Ross starred in another theatre released film. The film is soooo bad that Berry Gordy forbid it to be mentioned on any of the Motown tribute shows."
2,very average,"i'm a big Michael Jackson,Diana Ross&Richard Pryor fan.but this film falls flat.it made me happy with an all African-American cast.but the talents of all the folks involved don't really shine.one great thing came out of this film the Meeting of Quincy Jones&Michael Jackson."
1,A disaster,"I love THE WIZARD OF OZ. I love the book, and I especially love the 1939 movie version. I even love the less-popular 1985 sequal RETURN TO OZ. Maybe that's why this film just doesn't deliver.The film begins on the wrong note by casting Diana Ross as Dorthy. Not only is she way to old for the role, but her relaxed style of singing doesn't match the material. She just doesn't seem to be able to hold the picture together.Jackson, on the other hand, is well casted as the Scarecrow. It's just a shame the rest of the cast isn't as memorable. Everyone just seems to be going through the motions with out bringing any emtion or life to their characters. The whole production just plods along until the disapointing finale, with Prior looking anemic as the Wiz.Yeah, the production values are good, but there's no magic or joy. You and your family would be much better off following the old yellow brick road of the 1939 masterpiece."
3,Has assets and downsides,"This film had its assets. Some of the musical numbers (""Ease On Down the Road"", ""Can't You Feel a Brand New Day?"", ""Don't Nobody Bring Me No Bad News"") are good. Michael Jackson, Ted Ross, and Mabel King give good performances. Then there are some downsides to this film. Diana Ross is okay, but it's true that she's way too old; she was 34!!!! She doesn't sing very well, except in the last song, ""Home"". She has an irratating high voice, too. Lena Horne sings and speaks very well, but she sings in a strange way, constantly stretching out her arms as if in a plea to be liked. This film has very surreal elements, like the Munchkins coming out of the walls and the Wiz's room in the Emerald City. There are good and bad things in this fresh approach to an old, beloved story."
1,An Insult,"The Wizard Of Oz is a king among classic films, and no bonafide movie collection is without it. But the insipid concept of The Wiz, along with horribly dull performances and flat direction, result in a film experience that is without taste and beyond redemption. An insult to African-American culture and movie-goers in general."
5,Present,"I bought this for my bf because it is one of his favorite movies and he was excited when they played it on tv and when he was watching it. I thought it would be a nice ""just because"" present for him to add to his collection. He loved it."
3,Good,"The picture quality isn't very good. The movie is too ""grainy"" for me to enjoy. It is also too dark."
2,Painfully bad re-imagining,"From the odd choice to have Diana Ross (who looks about 40) in the lead to the bizarre set choices, this film is one that needs to be seen to be believed. Some of the songs are catchy, but that is the sum total in its favor and why I gave it two stars instead of one. Maybe the worst remake I have ever seen."
5,The Wiz on Blu Ray is PERFECTION!!,"The 1978 movie ""The Wiz"" has been restored to look as though it was filmed yesterday, not over 3 decades ago! The Blu Ray is flawless. The colors and images are vibrant. The picture makes you feel like you are right there it is so clear. You can see every line on their faces, every blemish, it gives you the ability to capture details in this film that were missed in previous vhs and dvd releases. The sound is like going to a concert. I already had this classic on dvd but never appreciated it as much as I do now watching it on Blu Ray. This is a MUST HAVE for any collector of Michael Jackson or Diana Ross. Universal outdid themselves with the quality of this Blu Ray."
5,Believe in Yourself,"Believe in Yourself. Great message. Must see movie for all adults and children. When in doubt of your abilities, watch this movie and believe that you can do anything you set out to do!"
4,"Looks good, sounds good",I bought this for my wife and we both were taken back to our childhood memories. The transfer and picture quality is good. The sound is excellent. Warning! This product may induce a wave of nastalgia and we all know how painful that can be.
2,Poor CD Quality,"While my family and I did enjoy the movie itself, the CD that we received was defective in three places which prevented us from enjoying a continuous veiwing of the movie. These defects were unexpected since the product was ordered as ""new"" and arrived with a standard plastic wrapping on the CD jacket."
2,movie i grew up loving,i was expecting a little more. thought there would be more to the making of the moving maybe some deleted scenes. but happy to have the movie
4,The Wiz,"Good offshoot of the classic movie. One of the songs is timeless, and frequently re-sung by various great artists and hopefuls."
5,I've been lovin' this movie for the longest time...PERFECT!,"I've loved this movie ever since I saw it on Disney about four years ago and I still love it. I love all the songs especially the one the lion sings when he first comes out ""...say what you wanta, but, I'm here to stay cus I'm a mean ol' lion..."""
2,not as good as the original,The Wiz is not the best version of the Wizard of oz. Diana Ross dosent have nearly as much energy as Judy Garland. The costumes are ok. The only thing I didn't like was the actor who played the wicked witch. And some of the sets could be more elaborate. My sugestion is dont waste your time on this movie.
1,Annoying,"I'm a great fan of Motown, but this production bored and annoyed me and scared the kids.Not worth it."
1,"poorly directed, some good musical numbers, Diana too old.","I was disappointed to say the least. Not entertaining appart from two musical numbers, 'You can't win' & 'Ease on down the road'. Diana is too old to play a young Dorothy, and it's all to fake really. I read somewhere about Sidney Lumet, that if he had the chance to do one of his movies again he would do The Wiz. Need I say more?!"
4,Very Entertaining,I always thought it would be cool if this movie was remade with every new generation's afro-american superstars. For example: In 2005 Dorothy would be Beyonce. The Scarcrow could be Usher.
1,Oh My God.,"...The Wizard of Oz (and.. any movie, really) puts this to shame. I can't believe this is from the guy that did ""Dog Day Afternoon."" Please, do yourself a favor and rent that instead."
2,Great in music... Very poor in perfomances,"I don't understand what the people in charge of producing ""The Wiz"" as a film, could get by joining the former ""BIG"" names of Diana Ross, Michael Jackson, Richard Pryor and Lena Horne in this trashy picture.The music soundtrack is by far, much better than the movie itself.I have lately become a great Soul music fan, so I recommend to get the soundtrack album and enjoy it considering it just as a very imaginative Soul music work, not keeping in mind that it's a ""movie soundtrack"". In such manner you will enjoy it more!"
1,The Wiz,"What a mess this movie is! The charm and innocence of the Broadway production is gone. It's a mean ol' movie full of bad news! Songs omitted or edited out of existence turn this into such a hash that there is nothing to commend it. I directed the stage production at Savannah State University and found it a charming play, full of hope and promise. The movie took all that out. And, when we meet the Wiz, he is pathetic. The Broadway production has him continuing his flim-flam to the very end. Dorothy learns much from all those she meets along the way, but we have an adult Dorothy here -- who should have learned these things when she was 12! The first song of the movie and the play is wonderful. The movie confused the story line of the song so much it was impossible to understand what Aunt Em was singing about. I wish a real Broadway tune smith had done the movie. And, Michael Jackson -- he's too cuddly!"
4,The Wiz Review,"Delivered in almost perfect condition, brand new, carboard cover a bit recked from postage I'd say but perfect otherwise :) really happy with it."
4,Fun TImes!,Thiu purchase was to replace a cracked cd in my collection . Magical movie from a fun time in the life of several great artist. Should be in every kids movie stack!
5,Great epic movie to have on blu-ray,This is a cool and somewhat sinister urban re-imagining of The Wizard of Oz. It makes use of a transformed NYC in a great way.
5,Wiz - true classic,"My 4 year old daughter specifically requested The Wiz on her Christmas wish list. I didn't think I would get it in time. With the easy access of amazon.com, it was under the tree and in good condition.Thanks~"
3,Disappointing - Pictures and text disjointed,"I thought the text was well written and informative and the pictures were wonderful but there was absolutely no link between the two. Text sections about the EMD had pictures of unrelated locos. It was frustrating to read about a certain locomotive and then have to search the entire book to try and find a picture of it. It was like the text was written, then they bought the nicest stock pictures of locos they could find and pasted them into the text wherever the art director wanted them, without ever reading the text. I was also hoping for more description of how a GP7 was different from an SD40 and such. Still looking for a book with that info."
5,More info in 96 pages than the phone book!,"Great, easily understood text with tons of close-up color photos. Covers topics ranging from the return to traditional cabs, Amtrak, yard switchers and the latest AC motive power from GE & EMD to the anatomy of a locomotive and how they work. Too bad it reads so quickly and is so short!"
2,Not for the hobbyists for sure!,"I bought this book because I wanted a complete book on Praying Mantids. I found this book to be way too excessif on the ""mantids behaviors"" and when I tried to find what is the right side to hang an ootheca no explanation were to be found any where in this book. For a book who claims to be complete! So unless you are going to be an University teacher who wants to specialise in Praying mantids, or is into dissecting them. I don't recommand this book at all, and the price ouch! Also this book claims to be generous with pictures, well! I don't see how a few pages in a very small chapter should be call generous."
5,the praying mantids book,"I got the book for my husband for Christmas, he loved it. Great gift for nature lovers. He would recommend this item for anyone wanting to learn more about mantids."
2,Boring,"I have enjoyed Chris Bohjalian's other novels. He usually picks an offbeat topic and sets up a lively family situation surrounding it. However, this novel seems endless, and the main focus gets drowned in wordy descriptions. His dialogue seems stilted and old-fashioned. For all the character development he describes in painstaking detail, you never really get to like any one of them. The book was at least 100 pages too long, and very repetitive. Not his best effort I'm afraid. I will continue to read his other novels, though, as his other novels are more engaging, especially those in first person."
1,Yawn,"I tried to like this book, I tried to read this book...all I ended up doing was yawning & falling asleep. Since I am having trouble sleeping, maybe this is a good book for insomniacs or those going through a major breakup like me. All I can say is I tried!"
1,Huge disappointment,"I have loved Bohjalian's books, every one of them until this one. He really dropped the ball in this novel, as did his editor who allowed all of the parenthetical asides that interrupted any flow he might have established in the narrative. The characters were vapid and unappealing, so unlike the persons of depth readers usually find. The plot was contrived and tedious. It was always a pleaure to learn from Bohjalian's work about a subject totally unfamiliar and surprisingly interesting, like midwifery or alternative medicine or transexuality. The FERAL people were consistently annoying and extreme to a fault. Their abrasive stance made Spencer's ""accident"" seem a just dessert for someone so narrow- minded and controlling. I am hopeful that, having purged this novel from his system, Bohjalian will write another that returns him to the ranks of outstanding contemporary authors."
4,A good read,"I won't go into great detail, as other reviewers have already provided thorough summations. I found this to be a well-crafted novel with excellently portrayed characters that develop and transform as the events unfold. I was pleasantly surprised at the crow's involvement near the end as I anticipated the evidence was just lost, never to be recovered by the police (as it often is in real life.) It was a lovely way to weave in the grandmother's earlier attempt to have the girls do the experiment with the crow and the dime - I love subtle foreshadowing. I will definitely have to check out other books by Mr. Bohjalian."
5,Classic Bohjalian,"Ok, I'm a Bohjalian fan from way back. You love his characters, you get inside their feelings and lives. Once again he has taken a few ""hot topics"" and woven them into a story that not only entertains but also makes you think."
4,A really good read,"BEFORE YOU KNOW KINDNESS is about a 12 year old girl who shoots her father by accident, causing him to lose all function and feeling in the arm. It is a sad story in many ways, but also shows how tragedy can change people in different and remarkable ways.A large part of the book is dedicated to the animal activist cause. For me, it was pretty radical. The dad who was shot was an avid vegan and animal rights activist. This plays a huge role in the story.I like Bohjalian as an author. I had to learn again that he takes his time and allows the plot to unfold slowly. I did not find this to be a quick read, but it was fascinating and very readable.A good read!"
4,deceptively simple,"This book, on the surface, is simple, straightforward and plot-driven. But the real power comes from its understatement. It is a beautifully-written and conceived story that reveals the complexity of human nature and yields a powerful statement about what is important in life. I am a psychotherapist and I have recommended this book to a few of my patients. It shows rather than tells. My favorite Bohjalian book."
3,Nothing here to excite me,"I started out thinking I'd found a good read, then realized about a third of the way in that nothing more was going to happen, except more of the same, which was getting boring fast. Couldn't get into or care much about the characters. Wasn't moved by the plot. Enjoy the author's writing...loved Midwives, but this one left me flat."
1,long story that could be summed up in 1/3 the book.,This book DRAGGED on. It was way too long and more detail than necessary. I was tempted to stop reading it several times and never finish.
3,Familial Crisis,"This is the story of the McCullough family and their descent into crisis when a teenage girl shoots her animal-rights activist father and the shock waves that it sends throughout the entire family.Each character in this book has their own story to tell, their own problems to face. The accident itself teaches each one of them about love, loss, innocence and most importantly, kindness.Family and relationships are at the heart of this book and what tragedy can do to interfere with the everyday lives of people. Fortunately it also sheds light on the fact that good can indeed come from tragedy."
2,Just Okay,It seemed as thought the author kept repeating himself over and over and the book was boring and predictable. Things started to pick up in the last 1/3 of the book and I became more interested. Not as good as Midwives.
2,"Good story, no heart","The story is interesting and certainly holds your attention, but it left me cold. There was no heart, no feeling. I could not develop a bit of empathy toward any of the characters. And there was just way too much detail. Who cares what the husband of a minor character such as the EMT does for a living?. I have read most of Bohjalian's other books, and find this one to be atypical of his writing."
3,similarities in ending with the way the crow flies,It was a good read. family issues and animal rights . I was somewhat suprised by the crow and the evidence. That was also the main part of the way the crow flies by Ann Marie Mac Donald. I immediatley compared them. Hmm. a little too similar for me. do authors have that problem?
4,"Nice novel, would prefer a better cover","As a mother who had to watch her happy, trusting, free daughter who ran through sprinklers in her swimming suit turn into an embarrassed sex symbol each time she put on a bathing suit beyond age 13, I'm always suspicious of novels that have to use a young, attractive, white female in a bikini on the cover, regardless of the excuse as to its connections to the story. Of course, women in bikinis shouldn't be sex objects, they are simply people out on a hot day, but we are conditioned to see them that way in our society, and it's cheap when book designers exploit that. Kind of like putting a picture of an obviously wealthy man with inhuman biceps on the cover of an intelligent book for women on relationships.Glad the pages inside were so much more intelligent than the cover. I almost didn't buy it for that reason. Thanks, Chris, for another contribution of value to good literature."
2,Tedious Read,"Droll but dull, this book ultimately leaves the reader flat, as if waiting for the long belabored point. Written with great technical acumen, endlessly trite observations never seem to take root and the result is disappointing."
3,Depiction of Family Matriarch,"Chris Bohjalian's Nan is ""elderly"" at 70, dead a short time later and probably would have died a decade earlier had she not lived a vigorous life. I find this age judgment a tad jarring and wondered about Bohjalian's arbitrary arrival at a leading character's destiny."
1,Terrible,"I cannot believe that so many people really enjoyed this book. Bohjalian's characters are, to a person, humorless and unlikeable, and his storytelling is weirdly gory and dry. A waste of time. Any single John Irving novel would be better and along the same lines."
2,Disappointing...,This novel was such a disappointment. There was little depth to the novel; actually it was very superficial and predictable.
3,On the fence...,"I've read all of Bohjalian's books, and I don't believe Before You Know Kindness is his best. There was no real suspense for me, and when things get wrapped up in the end, it's all pretty much what you'd expect. I wasn't too keen on any of the characters, except for Willow, and several of the characters seemed a tad superfluous, like Sara. Obviously, she's John's wife, but she doesn't do much for the story. I have to say that I saw Bohjalian do a live reading of parts of this book and he's very good in person. I just wish this novel had been a bit tighter."
1,"So bad, I got rid of the book","I'm a fan of Bohjalian's work, so it was a huge disappointment for me to rank this book as just 1 star. It was horrid. There were a few parts that captured my attention and moved beautifully. And there were a couple of others that were written with true talent. But for the most part, the book was filled with information that went nowhere, characters so flat and boring I couldn't care less about them, and a plot that, at the end of the book, made me say out loud, ""That's it?!?"" Some reviewers say it was a compelling family drama, and to that, I would have agreed IF Bohjalian didn't constantly lead the reader into believing there was something bigger around the corner, on the next page, in the next chapter. The book, as a whole, was a huge disaster for me. Long, pointless and with shallow characters. This novel went right to the library's used book sale as soon as I was done. And since I keep every single book I've read that I even mildly enjoyed, that's saying something."
1,Simply awful,"The only character in this novel who isn't flat and stereotypical in the grandmother, and she is just a slightly younger fictionalized version of Katharine Hepburn. There is very little action to move the plot (and I use the term ""plot"" loosely) forward, just endless inner monologues of each character's views on animal rights. It's also repetitive and very poorly edited. Blech."
3,Interesting New Story,"Hey, a new story. In this category of books, it is getting a tough to find something new but this was. They won and here is the aftermath. This book is inventive with a small cast of characters that are really detailed. The story line is good and with the suspense of the underground spy vs. the KGB, the book keeps you interested."
2,It's ok,"The premise of the book is good for someone who has a group setting, almost match maker group, to work within. It did not work for me as I do not.Skye"
5,Wow - an awesome book the introduces speed dating,"I was quite impressed by the amount of material covered in this book. There were many questions that I had because we were running these events at the university and needed an overview of what to expect. I think that these people are pioneers in the Speed Dating world and if anybody wants to get good theoretical knowledge, they should definitely read this. It helped us create Match Majik http://www.matchmajik.com where we have feature a lot of their work and articles. A great start for anybody interested in Speed Dating!"
4,Downtown and Dirty,"While the Jimes are a much better live band, the CD still has a lot to offer. Whether its the instrumental fire of ""Jump n'F"", or the dirty, grinding guitars on ""Swing Shift,"" its just a good all around disc."
5,Energetic,This CD is the type that gets your toes tapping and gettin' you in the mood to dance. I highly recommend purchasing this item.
1,how many per package?,I would like to order these for my daughter but the product description does not say how many briefs per package. Please update the description to include quantity. If the quantity is reasonable for this price I will order them.
3,Outer Space and Sea... at the Twilight Zone,"One of the many great things about ""The Wilight Zone"" is that in never considered boundaries, in any aspect. In this DVD we get to watch stories that take place at outer space or far at sea. In ""Elegy"" (Season 1)a group of astronauts land on a planet where its inhabitants act in a very strange way. In ""The Thirty Fathom Grave"" (Season 4) -written by series creator Rod Serling- the crew of a ship hears echoes from a submarine sunken two decades ago. ""A Short Drink from a Certain Fountain"" depicts a man that finds joy (or does he?) after he drinks from the fountain of youth. Note: this DVD includes an episode from Season 4, where they lasted an hour instead of the thirty minutes from the other seasons, which is the reason only three epiosdes are included."
3,Good but tarnishes easily.,"I would recommend this but after a few months it tarnishes, soif you're looking for something that will last this is not it. kinda overpriced."
1,Junk,"I should have know based on the price this would not hold up. It looks great, but within 2 weeks the hinge came apart (with normal wear and tear)."
3,150grams is just too light...,"This would be a great deal for a young person, but if you are over 13 I would recommend getting a heavier disc. You simply cannot get the distance out of these that you can from heavier ones.Good price for 4 discs though."
1,Just Awful!,This is a terrible product. I agree with Whit. Condensation is unbelievable! Even with the darn thing wide open at the head! The Goretex is awful. Go with eVent fabric...
2,"Falls Far Short of ""Truth""","I think ""Truth"" is an amazing album by the Jeff Beck Group, and was hoping for more of the same when I bought ""Beck-Ola."" After a few listens, I gave my copy of ""Beck-Ola"" to the local library. I'm not into loud, thrashing albums, and if you are, then this album will hold great appeal to you. Beck changed drummers from Micky Waller on ""Truth"" to Tony Newman on ""Beck-Ola"" and it was a change for the worse. This is a loud, loud album, no matter what volume setting you choose. Beck's guitar thrashings and Newman's pounding drums completely overpower Rod Stewart on most of the songs. The only song I would want to hear again is ""Girl from Mill Valley"", which is a lovely piano instrumental by Nicky Hopkins. ""All Shook Up"" is okay. The rest of the album gave me a headache."
4,"""Truth Part 2""","Beck-Ola is the second effort combining Jeff Beck and Rod Stewart. If you haven't experienced either album, you should start off with the first record called ""Truth"", a sixties masterpiece. Both albums were recorded back in the day when Rod could really belt out a rock song, instead of being the Las Vegas crooner he is today. Jeff ""guitarist supremo"" always is on. I believe this album was hastily put together due to the great sales of the first album. This is a fine example, still but spotty in a few areas, where it sounds like they made it up as they went along. These two albums launched Rod's career into hyperdrive, while Jeff was content to go into a more jazzier direction. Both are great listening, and the band lets you enjoy the fun they are having. These two always puts a smile on my face."
3,Increasing spectrum,"3 1/2Dropping some of the generic rawness and expanding his blues guitar palate, Beck's sophomore release is worthy of at least attempting to live up to some hype."
4,hidden gem,"At its best this CD is among the best work Jeff has done. Any fan of early Led Zep or British 60's Psychedelic Rock should have this CD as well as ""Truth"", the other JBG cd with this lineup.Rod Stewart has never sounded better. A band format has always been best for Rod."
1,Worked for a few months and is too expensive!,"I bought this charger with a canon camera. It worked for several months, and then died. Now, I am faced with replacing it at the expense of almost half the cost of the camera. What a rip off!"
2,Unhappy,I was so excited to find this item on line. I ordered product and received it very promptly. Went to use it and it does not work. I have contacted company via e-mail twice with no response to either have a refund or replacement.
3,Nice but Not exceptional,"This guest book was purchased for my Dad's memoral service (when it happens...dad likes to be prepared), he is 90 and feels any day now he will be going ""home"" to Jesus. The book is attractive, but not elegant. The inside has lined pages, but I was a little surprised, no printing such as ""name, address, phone or even email""How can thank you cards be written, if the person happens to be someone, that is not a close friend or a family member (that you would have contact information for?)"
5,My dogs love it,"I have a very picky dog. Everytime when I try to get him some pills, I have to hide the pill in his food...But Pet tabs does have a wonderful taste, I can even use it as a treat. Just to show how my dog loves it. Hahaha"
4,...,Haven't ordered the latest DVD yet but that's still on my to-do list. AI absolutely enjoy Animes and this one was a nive little addition to my collection.
3,"A Good Effort, but not perfect","A fine book on the American Gas Station. But pales in comparison to ""Pump & Circumstance"" by Margolies. Witzel's book contains no less than 61 photos of present-day abandoned gas stations, or rusting forlorn gas pumps. A few of these photos would be appropriate in this type of book. But 61! It really makes the book depressing to read. Gas station fans want to see colorful period photos of the stations in their prime."
4,A very readable and practical book on organisational learning,"Being a fan of Senge's work I was sceptical at first, but Bob Flood build on Senge's work and puts into a larger context of thinking holistically and futuristically.He adds complexity into the mix in that we must prepare for the unexpected and yet unknown situations using his diagrammatical perspective on scenario planning. I also enjoyed his pages on Satori, his bookshelf metaphor on Process, Structure, Meaning and Fairness (Knowledge-power as he coins it).The bottom line of the book as he puts it:* we will not struggle to manage over things, we will manage within the unmanageable;* we will not battle to organise the totality, we will organise within the unorganisable; and* we will not simply know things, but we will know of the unknowable.Flood co-authored `Creative Problem Solving' with Jackson, but I recommend getting this book instead as well as Jackson's later book `Systems Thinking: Creative Holism for Managers'."
2,vi3...more like viwho?,I am also from Chicago and am aware of vi3. i am honestly not fond of them. 1st song. GOGETHER. c'mon they sampled the NAME GAME. how horrible is that plane and simple.2nd song NOWHERE. they sang it cuzz they are honestly going NOWHERE
5,Complete and thorough,"Comprehensive guide to Media aesthetics.References and examples could be updated, but overall covers every aspect of media aesthetics and production."
5,The only joint med that works for my dog,"I don't know why but it works,and is the only thing that works for my dog."
1,not a great bag,"I searched for a diaper bag and thought that this would be ""the one"". First off it is soft and the material is really cute, however, the material is very soft and the bag has no structure. You have to use two hands to get anything out of it. Another thing I didn't like is the quality of the bag. I am comparing it to a Ju-Ju-Be bag that I did end up with. I unwrapped this bag and held it for a minute then wrapped it up and took it to the PO to send it back. I would not recommend this bag."
1,huh?,"i wonder it this is the ""real"" jessica bumble bag. i had bought this bag from another site and totally loved loved loved it. then i had ordered this from amazon at 1/2 of the price i paid at another site for my sister, but when she received it, it wasn't the same quality as mine. the bag felt flimsy, poor sewing/construction and poor hardware. it's definitely not the same as my previous bag that i had purchased from another site. so i wonder if i got a ""fake"" one fro 1/2 of the price. i knew it was too good to be true..."
1,Buyer beware...,"This is an older version of the Jessica bag. It is not the one currently in production from Bumble Bags. I purchased it, then returned it after receiving the package. There is only one magnetic snap to close the entire bag. It does not have the internal zipper, stroller straps, back zipper pocket or bottle holder pockets that are available on the updated models. Don't waste your money on this!"
3,"Cute bag, but...","This bag is very pretty. I get lots of compliments on it. I love it for quick trips out and about. However, I've resorted to my old backpack to hold everything needed for the day at daycare. There is no zipper under the flap, closes with just one snap, but if you have even a little too much in there it will not snap and things can fall out! It was on crazy sale, so I do not regret having it and use it on the weekends, but if I'd paid full retail for it I'd probably be disappointed."
1,i dont like them,"they have very light colors , not bright like the picture , and it shows as if they are not original, i didnt like them i didnt even put them on my bag"
4,These are cute little pins,"My daughter loves South park so I bought these for her. They are adorable. Little but great. They are not 1 inch they are 3/4"" across. But still cool"
2,So-so story...,"I bought this book based on the reviews found here, and unfortunately, I didn't enjoy it as much as the other reviewers. I don't want to say the story was flawed in any way because it could just be that it didn't suit my taste. But either way, I didn't particularly enjoy it. The best part for me was knowing the ending was near."
4,Fantastic characterization against a background of the Blitz,"Christopher Hyde has drawn an amazing fictional plot against a background of real-life characters and actual events. This marriage provides a novel that holds the reader in thrall from beginning to end. It is fascinating to see the story unfold through the eyes of its unlikely hero - and to suddenly realize that you are meeting actual characters from the London of World War Two throughout the pages! The historical detail is accurate and a delight to read, giving added depth to this intricate tale. I would recommend it to anyone interested in WWII, or psychological thrillers, or spy stories ...... as it combines a little of each within its covers."
4,Intense war-time mystery.....at times TOO intense,"This is one of the best-written and most logically thought out mysteries I have ever read. Mr. Hyde has obviously done his homework, and knows exactly how to keep the suspense at a consistently high level throughout the book. I'm very tempted to buy another of his books, although I understand from the critics' reviews that this book is something of a change of pace for Mr. Hyde, and so I'm a little unsure about it. I would have given the book five stars, except for the items already mentioned in other reviews (a second autopsy on a body, the VERY detailed descriptions of what happens during a bombing raid), and the very intense description of the killer's home toward the end of the book - up until then I was reading each page very slowly, but I sped through this part - it really turned my stomach.But that aside, this one heckuva good read."
2,Disappointed!,"My son received this for Christmas. He got frustrated quickly trying to put it together, and it took the adults several hours to assemble, then broke apart the minute we picked it up to move it. After many attempts to put it together and keep it that way, the pieces now sit in a toybox, forgotten. He likes the little turtle characters and the fighting platform, but the lair itself is a waste of time & money."
4,Quality toy for lego or megablock lovers,The toy has great detail and quality. Mi 9yr old son loves it. The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are great to play with and the slimy goo is a great addition. My son started putting it together and didn't stop until he finished it. He even wanted a picture taken of himself with the toy.
2,it's a good block set,The lair is good for people who like blocks. But i got frustrated a little too easily because i tried to study the instructions then when i put the piece i was working on to another part it crumbled to pieces or i tried to stick it together then it would break. so the durability is not good!!!
1,"Cheaply Made, Won't Last--Don't Buy It!!","This toy is worthless. It is made of cheap, thin plastic that will never last. My 4 and 6 year olds were totally underwhelmed and we took it back. The toy comes in many pieces that you ""snap"" together. Yeah, right. They don't stay connected at all and the entire thing was always in several pieces. The boys would try to play with it and everything just kept falling apart. The little balcony is a joke, just kept falling down when they placed a turtle figure on it. The ""rip cord"" wouldn't stay attached to the fence thing, so the turtle figures couldn't slide down it. It looks good on tv, but is just horribly fabricated. We have been much happier with the sturdier Rescue Heroes action figurines and accessories."
3,A zillion itty-bitty pieces,"This sucker took me 2 hours to put together...it comes with a ton of itty bitty pieces, to make a 2-story building, with a street on top of it. We're talking lots of the 2-dot legos here. Even the tv set has about 14 pieces, as does the couch! Needless to say, I'm not tossing this thing back into the general lego pile. It does have a cute car, and little weapons, and 1-inch figures, and my kid thought the ooze was super cool...for about 15 minutes on Christmas morning. I don't know why, but I got 4 turtle-mainiacs (ages 5-8) running through the house, and this thing just sits there. The Battle Shell Mobile, which holds 4 of the 5-inch figures, and shoots missiles, is a much better turtle toy."
1,Terrible,"I really had high hopes for this since Larry Clark directed it and it was one of Stan Winston's creature features, but it is truly disturbing and not in a good way. Feels like teenage pornography after awhile jsut for the sake of it. I couldn't even finish it. Absolutely not for children."
1,DODGE THIS LIKE A BULLET -------->,"Larry Clark you brave man. The cover of this DVD says ""THE FUTURE S*CKS"", it should have said something else like ""THIS MOVIE S*CKS"". One of the worse films I've seen in recent years. I have one simple question. WHY? Now I'll go on and tell you the pro's & con's. Let's start with the numerous CON'S.. 1. The acting is terrible, Will any of these actors work again? 2. Director Larry Clark's idea was good. However, he obviously didn't have the ability to put it all together. I have to scrutinize his future projects. 3. Stan Winston must have been working on Clark's budget, the F/X are not Stan Winston quality. 4. I care not to see a bunch of teenagers run around naked for an hour and a half. This is something that you can count on from Mr. Clark, being that all of his films are loaded with it. I could go on and on explaining how BAD this movie is, but I think you got it. Now for the PRO'S.. oh, sorry my mind just went blank."
1,This movie is up there with the Rocky Horror picture show!,"It's amazing to see anyone rate this movie with even one star - this was literally worse than the Rocky Horror Picture Show. It had a terrible story line and had even worse acting. It was honestly the worst move I've ever seen. I would recommend this movie to NOBODY. Seriously, do not waste anymore time on this page, go search for another DVD. Go now."
3,A Great Little Revival,"A wonderfully incoherent plot moves this flick from the wasteland to the bath scene. You'll be scratching your head and saying 'oh - come on'. But that's what distances it from the emasculation of the horror genre like the Scream series and the Blair Witch Project.70s horror owed so much to misguided teen sex where the monsters were punishing the young perpetrators. But in the 90s we got the PG version where horror just happened without the blood and gore. Here there's drugs, sex and nudity.From silly end of the world cults to a weird Toxic Avenger ripoff this one owes nothing to the original from the 50s."
3,I'm disappointed,I was a huge Andrew Keegan fan WAS.. I don't know what he was thinking when he signed to this movie. It was horrible the acting the storyline nothing made sense. And I gave 3 stars because I got to see Andrew's ...)ets but don't waste your money buying or renting it.
2,A step down,"Larry Clark, while known for his realism and brute honesty surely did not take a step up here. While the story made the path for a OK movie, it failed on its objective. When the kids get caught in the storm and just wake up and are clothed and all lying on eachother, it just does not seem real. The effects are somewhat korny and the graphic nudity and violence show its a Clark film. Drugs, alcohol,sex, and caveman. Not a great mix and this movie shows that."
2,so bad i could cry,"Larry Clark has a fixation with teens having sex on screen. It was a bit shocking on Kids and Bully, but here it just looks like soft core porn. The reason why: this movie has no plot. It is extremely absurd. Cave teens discover a city in ruins inhabited by two mutants who want to turn them into mutants as well. but in the process some kids die of horrible gory deaths...having a lot of sex, drugs and booze in the way.Kids was a masterpiece, Bully was also one of the best movies of 2001. They were pretty raw but they had interesting topics. Teenage Caveman is really preposterous.Instead of developping his skills as a filmaker after Bully, Clark has taken a huge step back with Teenage Caveman."
2,Not for fans of Larry Clark.,"I bought this video strictly because I am a fan of Larry Clark. I was disappointed in that it is not at all like his other films. It is basically a sci-fi/horror film. As such, it has merit, but that is not a genre I am particularly interested in. Do not by this based on Clark's other films. You will be disappointed."
1,"It's horror alright, but not as intended","Thank God this was a rental. This ""horror film"" is neither ""horror"" nor a ""film"". 50% of the 90 min run time was drug scenes and sex crazed drinking. NO PLOT, NO DIALOGUE, NO......ANYTHING. Just put a half dozen teenagers in a room, give them booze and cocaine and watch them have sex. That is all that happened for 45 minutes. I am totally convinced that their was no script for this movie. Almost every line seemed to be improvised. Its almost as if the director told the kids to ""just wing it"". The ONLY scene in this film that even resembled horror was the finale. And it was so laughable done that it bordered on comedy.One bright spot though was some of the acting. Forgive me for not knowing the names of these youngsters but the main bad guy/monster was an EXCELLENT actor. He had the look and delivery of someone that didnt belong in this film. His character was a bit annoying though. But this young man should be in better work than ""Teenage Caveman""."
1,absolutely awful,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. There really isn't more I have to say about this, because there is nothing in the movie worth talking about. The cast could have done much better however they just came off as talentless and I couldn't believe they were taking it so seriously. I gave it one star simply because I was not able to give it zero. My recommendation is, don't waste your time or your money. I'm glad I didn't, I happened to catch it on HBO."
3,caveman,there are many moments this movie comes off like soft porn with madash of gore thrown in. if you are looking for a movie about a caveman this is it.
2,Don't buy for the nudity claimed by other reviewers,"Basically nothing but an R rated movie, the usual BS about it being unrated to make you think it's better than a movie you might see on Skinimax, which it's not even close. Only one hot woman at that."
3,tiffany sweet tiffany,"the movie is basically horrible. it is worth the price , however, for the pleasure of viewing tiffany limos' beautiful face and body. she is in another film where she reveals more.the filmis called ken park. she is so beautiful and sexy. buy these films to see this lovely asian beauty."
3,"Pretty, but...","I know this set isn't currently available, but I'll write my review anyway. I love the cobalt blue color of these dishes, but I have three problems with them:1. They're awfully slippery. Don't know why, or how that could be fixed, but I have to be careful when putting them in the oven or washing them.2. The square and rectangular baking dishes have very rounded corners. Makes working with a rigid spatula difficult.3. The lids for the small custard cups don't all fit properly.The Pyrex cobalt blue baking set looks like it has more reasonable corners, but after reading the reviews from people who have had it explode, I think I can handle the Anchor Hocking ""problems"" I listed above. :)"
3,"Cheap, both price and make","You get what you pay for. It worked to play with our cat, but wasn't something I would try to use otherwise."
3,Good to have if you're going to Monument Valley,"This is a very simple, though very adequate map of the Hopi and Navajo Nations. It also features decent insets of Chaco Culture National Historic Park (a.k.a. Chaco Canyon), Monument Valley, and Canyon de Chelly National Monument, though if you go to any of these places you'll probably want to bring an additional guidebook or two. They're huge, and can swallow you up."
3,So-so,"A Most Unusual Camera was good, but I thought the ending was abrupt and kinda ruined the whole thing for me.Uncle Simon was laughable. The robot walking with the cane was hilarious.I didn't like the war one, it didn't show the battle scene.I was dissapointed with this dvd."
1,THIS IS NOT THE 1958 VERSION WITH JANE POWELL,The 1958 one with Jane Powell and Hedy Lamarr is extinct. This one is a badly made movie of the same name that has nothing to do with the original.
3,Church Growth Compilation,"Ranier does the church a favor when he pulls together in this volume the history, theology and principles of the movement. After each chapter is additional suggested reading list.One can easily and concisely in this work see the development and emphases of this movement. Now somewhat outdated (1993 publication), nevertheless the info here presented is worthwhile to those desiring to pursue the topic.The far stronger and longer section is principles, interestingly enough set apart from the theology. Here one can see the focus of the movement. Questionable theology can only lead to suspect principles and application."
4,Hyzy Scores,"This is the first Alex St. James mystery but it is the 2nd one I have read. It is a good quick read. It's a mystery with a reporter as the main star. I rate it it as a good story, easy to read and enjoyable."
2,Old news,It seems like the author is trying to get too many story lines into one book and none of them are really new or done with a new twist. For the price it is an OK read.
5,Manring is the man.,"As a bass player, I appreciate good bass work. Manring is at the top of his field as a bass player. In total control all the time.Don't play this cd on shuffle. :-) All the tracks work together. It's like one giant tune."
5,Great Noise !,"This album is one of those albums you put on before you go to bed ......without getting a headache right before you crash.ALex ,Tim ,and Micheal are all phenomanal in this trio.This cd is more like a huge soundtrack with no lyrics.I'd describe this album as PinkFloyd/noise/soundtrack/chaos.For all the Tim Alexander lovers ...this is a must buy !"
2,One of the bay area's best???,I feel Rich really didnt come with his full potential on this album. The beats were weak and the verses were stale. His last two albums displayed more of his skills. As a West Coast Rap fan its a shame to see rappers with great potential fall off. All we can do is hope that Rich can come back strong on his next album and really rep. for the West Coast.
4,fully portrayed,"frankly speaking, i don't know well about 20th century classical music. the only reason buying this album is well-known Kodaly sonata by the film 'Les Amants Du Pont-Neuf' i heard that first time with Starker's playing, the legend. comparing with Starker, Haimovitz's tone is somewhat blunt. but in the phrasing, very smoothnis."
3,"Great story idea, good writing, but really violent.","As usual, Alton Gransky writes very well. The characters in Vanished are well developed and interesting. The premise of the story is excellent. But for me this book failed because it was far more violent than others he has written tat I have read. I found the violence excessive, especially the Black Ops people in the underground encounters with the Marines. Lots and lots of death, and more gore than I expected. So I was disappointed with ""Vanished."" Certainly, I would not recommend that anyone under 15 years old read this book."
3,Mikasa Parklane series,I purchased a set of Mikasa Park Lane in 1995 and was trying to add some pieces that were missing and broken. The glasses are nice if you are not trying to match exactly to an existing set. The glasses are thicker than my original set and the top of the glasses have a curved edge that is different then the straight edge of my existing ones. They are very nice but there is a difference.
4,Let's really correct the record,"Lads and lassies, what we need to correct are the erroneous details from the well-intentioned reviewer below. In general, he's right: McDermott was born a Scot in Glasgow. In fact his mother's family -- which came originally not from Dublin but from Ballymeena, near Belfast, in Northern Ireland -- had been in Scotland for several generations before John was born. But his father emigrated to Scotland from Bunnygee in Donegal, in Ulster but a part of the Republic. So by heritage on both sides McDermott is definitely Irish.Besides, Irish and Scots are the same tribe anyway, speaking basically the same language and sharing centuries of history. The Romans' name for the Irish was ""Scoti,"" after all, and that Irish treasure, the Book of Kells, was probably begun on the Scottish isle of Iona. So why quibble?And yes, the voice is bonny."
4,Ashra - 'Sauce Hollandaise' (Manikin Records),"A good, later-day release by Ash Ra Tempel's main player Manuel Gottsching's (then) side project, spin-off band, etc. I, personally remember first finding out about this import CD from a friend-of-a-friend. Altogether, a worthy effort. Liked the keyboard enriched ""Echo Waves"" (31:29) best. But the other two tracks here have something to say as well - like the out-there ""Twelve Samples"" (21:08) and the techno ""Niemand Lacht Ruckwarts"" in English means ""Nobody Laughs Backwards"". Check it out."
2,"Great idea, poorly implemented","Pros:- Built in USB connection. No cables to find.- SD card slot: tons of storage- standard AAA battery- easy to useCons:- no way to select which directory to play or start at- no way to select internal vs SD card (starts with internal and then works its way to SD if it's there)- NO WAY TO RESUME WHERE IT LEFT OFF - it would be perfect for listening to long lectures or audio books, but if you stop half an hour into a 1 hour lecture, you have to start at the beginning again- no fast forward- SD card sticks out (barely worth mentioning)If I can find one like this that resumes where it left off, I'll buy it and toss this one."
1,Windows Users Beware,"I could never get my computer (Windows XP) to recognize this device. I tried three other computers. I downloded the driver for Windows. Trekstor tech support (available by e-mail only in the US, unless you want to call their numbers in Europe) promptly gave me instructions for forcing the device to be recognized. Nothing worked.After investing several hours of effort, I gave up in frustration. It was not the plug and play experience I expected."
5,A must for all those waiting for a Candi Staton secular disc,"After seventeen years, Candi's back! James Horracks and Thomas Foley of React Records in London persuaded Candi to record a secular CD, and it's GREAT! Excellent arrangements, and songs with lyrics she could agree to (all songs have a message, some more subtle than others). My personal favorite is the opening track, ""Love Yourself,"" though ""Outside In,"" ""Love on Love"" (written for Candi by Boy George), and a millenium remake of ""Young Hearts Run Free,"" are all excellent. Great music here! Totally worth the import price."
5,"""You Got The Love"" ?","I'm certain this cd is outstanding. ""You Got The Love"" is a powerful song. But I hesitate to purchase after reading the earlier reviewer's statement to 'get the UK Import because the cd here does not include the track ""You Got The Love""'.Can anyone say if this is true? I've run into this problem buying here before and don't want the hassle of making returns again. Would appreciate clarification. Thanks!"
5,YOUNG HEARTS RUN FREE,Young Hearts run free is always my no 1 song since 1977 I am listing to this song almost every day.It remind me of a lot of memories and when I was young. Love to have photo signed by Candi Staton. Thank you
4,Great Show But Who Is In It?,"Love the series but when I logged onto this site to check out the name of the actors, only one appears and if you click on more actors you get a picture of all the episode jackets! I just wanted to put the actors' names with the characters they played. This site needs improvement."
5,A trip back to Cicely,"When we get to missing Alaska, where we've been several times, we spend an evening in Cicely with these old friends on Northern Exposure!!! We STILL cry (yeah, both of us)and laugh and wish like crazy that they would bring it all back to television. IT's SO MUCH better than most of what's on at present!!! We have all five seasons of this program, and anxiously await the sixth and final one!!!Keith and Jill Rhodes"
3,Furious,"I recently purchased this video set, and like so many others, was APPALLEDat the replacement soundtracks. I really didn't expect it would be THAT bad. There were episodes in which the final track GREATLY added to the emotional impact of the theme, particularly in the second episode of Season 5. I had waited for THAT moment and heard nothing but Musack. This production debacle is INEXCUSABLE. If you are a true fan, don't bother puchasing these pathetic ""reproductions."""
3,Great show,I enjoyed this show back in the 90s.The 5th season was starting to change from the earlier episodes aired then.
5,Love it,I love this series. I have watched these over and over... In fact I think I'll go watch them now!!!
5,very good,Love this little book. It is divided into very small portions that are just right. She is an amazing writer .
5,The best; playing as one being,"My son is 13-year-old cellist Oliver Aldort, [...]. He listens to music all day long and he listens to many chamber groups and conductors of same music. When it comes to chamber music, Oliver has always come back to Amadeus quartet and I bought this CD for him because he says, ""Even the best other quartets always have some out of tune notes, or don't have as ringing sound. The Amadeus quartet sound like one person, playing with immaculate intonation and great tone and expression."""
4,A must have book for any parent with a two year old!,"I am a first time mother of a two-year old and found myself able to relate to this book. It has answered many of my questions concerning a number of topics, such as tandrums, sleeping problems, discipline and so much more. I would recommend this book to any parent who has a child entering the ""terrible-twos."" Unlike many parenting books, this book divides the second year into three different month groups, which allows you to see the progress your child will make throughout the whole year. I feel as if the book has given me hope for the coming year, that I still might be able to keep my sanity, as well as manage my overactive little girl."
4,Great CD!,"I have the Broadway, London versions of the CD's and I have heard the Austrailian cast. The cast is almost perfect with Tommy Korberg playing the Russian and Anders Glenmark (who was an Ambrosian singer in the London Album) does an ok job at the American however isn't the greatest. The Arbiter and Florence are incredible and the Arbiter is a rival to the London version's. An overall great CD with great singers and chorus and especially orchestra, however I give this album a 4 star and not five because of the Americans tendancy to butcher certain songs although he does superb on most of the songs."
3,Not great,"I can't give it less than 3 stars because I love the musical. However, this recording is less than spectacular. It sounds like it was recorded by some guy in the audience with a mono tape recorder. I was disappointed in the leads, also. They're trying to hard to sound like rock stars, which makes them sound rather cheesy. There are good moments, but if you're new to ""Chess,"" go with the original concept album. You can't beat Elaine Paige and Murray Head."
4,An ok album.,"I now own all the five major (legal) recordings of Chess; Original Concept, Broadway Cast, In Concert, ""Danish"" Complete Cast and Swedish cast.All of these have their strenght and weaknesses, but as for completeness, one have to go for the Swedish or Danish recordings. As it is, I dislike the Swedish one, and the Danish is hard to get. That makes this Concert Recording the most complete of the remaining Chesses, but not necessarily the best sung.I would not have bought this if it was not because I found it in a second hand cd store at a very low price. If you have the Danish album, you don't need it.If you are a Chess virgin and cannot find the Danish album, chose this for near completeness or the Original Concept Album for best cast.Avoid the Broadway Cast (extremely incomplete, though well sung) and the Swedish Cast (kind of complete, but otherwise weird and lacking the Chess spirit) if you don't happen to be a total Chess nut."
4,Chess in concert (1994 Swedish Concert Cast),"I've recently finished performing the musical chess, and i found this album to be alot more entertaining. Soviet Machine is featured on this album unlike the 1986 album. The Soviet Machine would have to be my favourite song in the Musical. It's worth Buying."
3,Some strong points...,"I am a big fan of this musical, but this version is a little dissapointing. Florence and the American just don't sound as good as Kuhn (from broadway) and Head (from London) if only we could get them to do a version together! However this CD does have strong points, such as the Russian parts."
3,Not that good,"Contains the extra songs not found in the ""studio release"" (with Ms. Paige etc.). However, the quality is poor and even the artists are no match to the ones in the studio recording. However, a must for Chess-aficionados."
5,Top-notch guitar playing.,"Well, everyone is correct by saying this album is AMAZING, but I just wanted to make a little side comment. I saw the release date here at Amazon, and it says 1998... well, that's the ""commercial"" release date, because this album was recorded and ""released"" actually in 1993 or 1994, and it was sent as a gift to suscribers of a guitar magazine, I forgot which one. I first heard this album in 1994 and was blown away by it. By the way, on the first song, Reb Beach plays all instruments if I'm not mistaken."
5,This deserves more than five stars!,"Unbelievable! This is one of my cds that I'm surprised isn't worn out. If I had the cassette, it would have been in a week. I love all the songs on this cd, but Zakk Wylde's ""Farm Fiddlin',"" in my opinion, is one of the best songs ever written by anyone in the history of life on this planet! It is absolutely perfect. As a whole, so is this cd. If you're into guitar music, then you will kick yourself until the day you die if you don't buy this. Then after you're dead, your friends will kick your body. I kid you not."
5,It's GOOD to get outside the box!,"Richie Samoboa, Dickey Betts, Zach Wylde, Richie Kotzen, Nuno Bettencourt, and others! Yes, you have to have grown up in the late 80's to know these people, but it's a really fun CD.The theme is to let a bunch of well known guitar heroes compose songs and perform them outside of the normal music confines of their normal band. The creativity here is fantastic and the types of ""guitar music"" is greatly varied giving it a constant interest (vs. say hearing all of a Satriani CD, which is great music, but can sound the same).This is a perfect CD to mix in with a CD/r! They are all cool songs and can be used to spice up some of your usuall music themes.I give it 5 stars for the creativity and fun/cool songs that developed. I give it a 3.8 as far as CD's I listen to consistently."
1,Self-indulgent garbage,"I tried to listen to this several times, but it is BORING! The songs all sound as if they are slight variations of the same theme: ""Look how fast I can play"". No interesting ideas, just fast, repeated riffs. There are so many talented guitar players out there, I can't imagine why anyone would want to waste their time listening to this cd. The previous reviewers thought it was good - maybe to a pre-pubescent kid with a brand new electric guitar, but to any with even slightly mature taste, this offers nothing but a headache."
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"I have order this dvd with high hopes, i was even willing to pay extra on shipping. but i was wrong, the dvd is not as described it is not all regions."
4,Awesome!!,"Ok. This is one of the best games in history. A must buy. You can play against any of the houses, and you can even unlock the cool brooms including the Firebolt. This has action packedfun just like the books. It's awesome. (...) if you have a gamecube buy this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This game has awesome sounds, gameplay, graphics and more. This game should be brought by all gamecube owners!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The best game in history!!!! The best game of all time!!!!Dont think about getting this game, just get it! Trust me!!!!!!!!!! I dont like this game, I love this game! And I'll love it till the end! So just get it!!!!!!!!!!!!(...)"
3,disturbing look at a little boy's life,"Sam Jones III, plays Louis Fletcher(or ZigZag), he's this boy with problems, one being that he has an abusive father, played by Wesley Snipes(havent's seen Snipes this badassed, but its not in a good way). ZigZag has a job and he works for Oliver Platt, or the Toad(bastard in this movie) and then ZigZag steals money from his vault and tells Singer(John Lequizamo who is absolutely great) who is diagnosed with cancer. so ZigZag is spiraled into a world of tricks and he's trying to fit in the world and Singer is rying to help him. written by David S. Goyer(writer of Blade and Blad II) you can note that Snipes plays Blade in both of them and also the an who plays Cadilacc Tom(Luke Goss), the owner of the strip club, played Jared Nomak in Blade II. some disturbing moments but also a good drama and you feel for this boy. other actors: Abraham Benrubi, Natasha Lyonne,Sherman Augustus, Miguel Nunez, Michael Greyeyes and Elizabeth Pena"
4,ZIG ZAG,ENJOYED THIS MOVIE IT'S A GOOD HUMAN RELATED... IT SHOWED THROUGH FAST NOT SLOW OR DISCONNECTED LIKE IT DO SOMETIMES.
2,The Cruelty of Misinformation,"Yes, this is a most interesting, yet ultimately arcane and outdated work. Clinical Depression is a muddy area, wherein the biological and psychological often overlap. The fact is, a normally healthy and happy woman can descend into a severe postpartum depression, and depressive disorders often run in families. Something is genetically amiss, and to relegate the treatment of this illness to philosphers and psychoanalysts exclusively is a painful and unkind step back into the Dark Ages. Nevertheless, there is some value to this book, yet it needs to be taken with a grain of salt."
2,The Miramax Version is Mediocre,"I love the beautiful animation. The design of Princess Yum Yum is stunning. The Characters are beautifully Drawn too bad it didn't get finished by the original creator. I believe would have been much better. Look up the websites for the "" Theif and the Cobbler"" You will learn why people complain about the miramax version. So much has been erased. I hardly can percieve it as a bestseller never mind a blockbuster. If you find a website about the original. It will wow you at how much has been removed and chucked from this master piece. I had difficulty finding it. I hope it comes out on DVD."
4,Oh the childhood memories!,"I loved this movie when I was little. It's cheesy, silly and great for kids. The animation style is also really great... I think that's what drew me to it in the first place."
1,The shattering of an artist vision,"This movie is horrible. The voice acting is bland, the animation was wonderful and unique before Miramax took over the project, and the song sequences make you want to be lobotomized with a rusty nail. Overall this film is a mess. Just one big mess. Save yourself some time and money and just stay as far away from this piece of cinematic diarrhea."
3,the saddest story in the animation world,"Here we have one of the greatest accomplishments of animation fallen into the hands of some hollywood producer who decides that there's no room in the world for an ambitous, unique, and creative animated film. So the whole thing is reworked to follow the classic animated feature formula by adding dumb songs, awful dialogue (to the characters meant to be silent), and poor animation which stands out embarrassingly against the original masterpiece. The original content that survives is breathtaking, try to ignore the shudders you get from everything else."
5,The kids love it!,"Although I have to agree with some of the negative comments made by other adult reviewers in terms of the animation and quality of songs, the fact is that my children (3 and 5 years old) adore it. They think it's hilarious, and have begged me to get them a copy. And the movie has grown on me, now that I've gotten used to the different animation style (different from the typical Disney film, that is). If I were rating it for myself, I'd probably give it two stars (for the unique graphics, the humor of the thief, and Vincent Price's rendering of Zigzag), but my kids would give it five stars, no contest."
4,wierd,"the first time i got it it was early and plastic wrapped, but the disk was missing, the seller was quick in getting back to me. soon enough i got a new disk"
4,"Incredible artwork and quite funny, too","Despite the caustic review from Leonard Maltin above (I never buy any of his guides for this very reason - he cannot let himself see any successful scenes in anything he rates - even Star Wars, the originals, rated three stars in his guide), I found The Thief and the Cobbler to be very interesting and entertaining. The artwork is simply astounding in how the shapes and colors are handled, and the script is quite funny in places, especially the lines of the fumbling thief. The animated film features several interesting characters, and, furthermore, the story is clean, simple, and unspoiled by any infusion of what we think is ""right"" for films like this. The songs may not be adhere to your brains (since when have songs begun to be requisite for animated films?), but I don't find that distracting (quite opposite, I find catchy tunes to be the most horrible of all...). This is a great film that has likeable heros, wily villains, and a wonderful ending."
4,Thief & Cobbler Review,Quality and value was great...shipped as promised and delivered as expected. Will order from them again without hesitation.
2,Petition Lassiter,"The last hope to see this film as it was intended to start a write in campaign to John Lassiter who is the head of Disney Animation. All the bad blood is gone there's still a chance this masterpiece can be finally finished as it was originally intended. Buy this cruddy cobbled job if you must, but let's get try one more time to have Disney finish the original."
5,Thief and the Cobbler,A wonderful alternative to Alladin. A story about a poor shoemaker who falls in love with a princess and together they save their kingdom from an invading army. Has a couple good songs in it as well.
4,Great movie,"My son loves this movie, remembered it from 9 years ago and was so happy to finally find it again. He has probably watched it 30 + times already."
1,All of the above....,Not much more to add that hasn't been said already. I'm very pleased that so many people know the history of this troubled little gem of a movie and are angered by it's mistreatment.
2,poor quality,"The story line is great, the graphics are amazing, the acting is well done, but I bought the inexpensive DVD version and it is totally out of focus. Very poor quality. I wish I had bought the more expensive version."
4,Every school library should own this.,"Written at the preteen/teen age level this book would be an asset to any school library. I had my 11 year old Bipolar son read the book and it gave him a short, concise overview of his disorder. He has always been asking questions and we have an extensive library at home of books on the subject of mental illness but this was the first one that was at a level where he could understand and not get bogged down in the ""psycho babble"". We are recommending this book to the school district and his school."
4,"not bad, but a bit pricey","I'm a Bipolar mom who has been searching for books to explain my disorder to my children. This one seems to be aimed at approximately 11- 12 year olds, I think. My 8 yr old daughter is advanced for her age, though, so we've been looking at it some together. I like that it has questions to start discussions. That's one of the things my daughter and I have needed, a starting point to discuss how my illness affects her. I did think the price was a bit high for this book, though. It's quite a bit shorter than I thought it would be for the price."
5,Excellent and simple introduction,"This is an excellent introductory book on bipolar disorder. If you, like me, don't know anything about the subject it's a great place to start. I think teens will find it pleasent to read, specially because of the real-life examples of other teens. The only problem is the relatively high price for such thin book. The editors should make a cheaper soft cover edition."
1,Can't afford the whole series this way,"I intended to collect the whole series as it came out. But with this release they are too greedy, and I cancel that plan. Season 6 has 22 episodes, yet this box has only 12 episodes in it. With 15 seasons they could have made a fair amount of money, but they chose to kill the golden goose by trying to double the number of box sets.They can try again without being so greedy. Perhaps all 283 episodes in one box for $100 would make up for the travesty of box 6."
2,what about the subtitle only,I love bleach and have watched every episode that has aired on cartoon network so I know they have English dubbed versions. I'm of the mind that if you want to read something get the book. not having an English dubbed 6th box set or any after is truly wrong my kids have gotten into it and so I have bought 1-5 but even paying the price for split season I won't buy a book on video. so unless you like to read your anime not a good buy
5,Bleach Uncut Box Set 6,"Since my family and I love Bleach, I can't see anything wrong with season six. It has just enough information on the bounts and action between the soul society, the rioka, and bounts that we heartbroken to see it end."
1,Only in Japanese,"Catching this after pre-ordering, I saw that the only language it is being offered in is Japanese with English subtitles. I phoned Amazon and sadly, they do not have a relase date for the English version. :("
2,Your killing me Viz!!!,Bleach is one of the best animes you can ever watch. But Viz you guys are pissing off a lot of fans by going from a 5 disc box set to a 3. It's ridiculous!! That just tells all of the fans that your just trying to milk out as much money as possible from us and thats complete bullcrap! You should be rewarding those who acually want to buy all of the seasons. I mean come on its very very easy to just download it for no cost. Im not that kind of person But you know how easy it is to do that. originally I would deffinatley reccomend buying all of the seasons. But now I wouldnt waste my money on a company thats trying to milk its customers of as much money as possible.
2,Box sets...,"Box sets are suppose to be the full season priced for one whole package. This is a disgrace to package ten episodes at a time, instead of a full season. It only gets worse, since they butchered the seasons by only selling ten to twelve episodes at a time. Seasons merge together from this Dvd set on. Terrible onslaught of a great Anime. Thanks greedy people, for ruining yet another good thing.And to those who don't like the complaints, obviously you don't know much about consuming. They have ripped you off, and others, and we should stand for ourselves, and ask for the real Box sets to please be returned for us to purchase."
4,greed?,"Many anime companies are going out of bussiness in america, if you enjoy it keep buying it or it will go away just like geneon."
2,Its in english,"All the region 1 Bleach DVD are in English/Japanese though Amazon doesn't list it as being so, [...] shows when the region 1 release's are."
3,Cut backs?,"Here's where the anime kicks it up and...starts picking our pockets. The episodes included in BOX SET 6 and beyond are the episodes that provide somewhat a new feeling to the anime. As much as I follow Bleach, it's starting to make more sense to follow it through adult swim. BOX SETS 1-5 had on average about 20 episodes because they were SEASON BOX SETS...so what happened to SEASON 6? These ""BOX SETS"" are a way to throw some of the episodes at us before the SEASON BOX SET becomes available. MULTIPLE guides pertaining to anime SEASONS state that SEASON 6 does have 21 episodes included. SEASON 7 begins with episode 132, and has 19 episodes. So why pay the same price for a BOX SET with almost half the episodes than a SEASON BOX SET? For now I'll wait till the proper SEASON BOX SETS are released."
3,"Great Eps, Poor Packaging","I agree with the majority of reviewers here. The episodes are great however this is the first box set where the size of the set is that of a single DVD case, there are no extras (mini-posters, mask, etc...), there is also no insert, and even the display of the DVD case looks cheap. For the price there should be more to this set. The DVDs in this set also differ from the pattern which the DVDs from all prior sets have used (Japanese lettering going down in at least one column with episode numbering including on the disk.)"
1,This is actually Season 5 part 2,"When I got Season 5 I was shocked that it ended when it did. I have always held season five progressing till Oriheme (mispelled) was taken by the Arrancar's and then Ichigo goes after her. That is when Season 5 SHOULD end. So I went to Bleach on Wikipedia and saw that Season 5 ended when it should have in the box set. Season 6, however, are episodes 110 to 131 NOT 121 VIZ. You are screwing the Americans for more money. I believe we should let them know that we are aware and no longer stand for it."
5,Bleach review,My son and his wife loved this box set! They will probably order the next set from someone ASAP!! The person that sold this to my son took care of things so fast that it was here before my son even realized it!! Will do business with this person again~~!!Rhonda
3,"""Viz continues its reign of terror over anime fans..""",I honestly have nothing good to say about Viz whatsoever..the releases of there anime titles over the last two years have been handled so poorly that it should be a crime against them for releasing such cheap & poorly packaged items.Viz continues its reign of terror over anime fans by canceling the much beloved Monster animated series after only releasing one box set last year in December(I still feel very jaded about that)no news was given about this..they simply canceled it not saying a word at all to the anime fan base..this is what Viz does..they will continue to do this because they simply don't give a damn about there titles..sadly its just how it is folks..The episodes of Bleach that aired on Adult Swim months ago have yet to be released on DVD..so lets hope Viz can release the DVDs faster..but that won't be happening..at the manga end of things they are just as bad..Viz seriously needs to get there act together.
1,too much,i am not buying this until it is at least 12.00 seriously only ten episode. viz is seriously being too stupid i love bleach to death and all and when i love an anime show i buy the shows not just watch them on the web. so viz you wont have me as a consumer anymore of bleach until you lower the price to match the amount of episodes.
3,Not worth it,"The episodes are incredible. They're back to following the Manga, out of the Bount arc, and really starting to get interesting. So this review isn't about the episodes, because they're some of the best... it's about the product.Half of a season for this much money is ridiculous. It's not even in a box set of dvd sleeves like the three volumes of the Bount arc. You get one single DVD case with three DVDs inside the case. (Picture a Blu-ray, DVD, digital disc combo pack. Three disc holders in one little package) and absolutely nothing extra like the first three seasons offered.I only bought this because I could pile up the discounts at the store where I purchased it and managed to get it for $16. 16 for 12 episodes is a better price than 40 or 50 for 12. That's insane. It's hard to stomach for 22 episodes, but half a season? Ridiculous."
1,Angry at split,"I am a huge fan of Bleach i would watch it every day if i didnt have to pay bills and work. I am slowly buying all the box sets but the splitting of season 6 is worse than the season 4 split. at least i was able to buy both parts of season 4 at the same time, but ive yet to see the second half of season 6 for say anywhere. season 7 seems to be sold whole but i dont want to buy it until i can get the complete season 6. if anyone knows where i can get it please email me at howitzerhunter@yahoo.com subject bleach. ive looked at the viz site and funimation but i havent found it. thank you for any help in finding it"
2,Price Gouging?,"The price for this partial season is the same price I paid for each of the season 1-3 box sets. The same price for half as much stuff is a COMPLETE rip off. And they are wondering why they are losing so many customers to streaming and downloading over dvd's? Viz is the crappiest and slooooooowest production company for an anime....if they really are wanting more money, then they should release only subbed versions as soon as they're able (yes many of us would rather have subbed versions quickly than waiting half our lives for a season to be dubbed by your snail of a company) and then re-release the subbed versions with the dubs, like they already do, twice the money, and no pissed off consumers."
1,Viz has become overly greedy....Again,"I love bleach and bought the first 3 season box sets, and waited to buy the 2 part bount saga. Of course the bount was 27 episode one episode over a full season so of course they ""had no choice"" to break it up. I also bought season 5, but I will not buy this 12 episode box set. Viz lost a customer here, I am done fooling around with this garbage, they already release single volumes, why do they have to screw their fanbase with a box that is basically 2 single releases. I will not buy, and wont buy anymore until Viz gets their act together."
4,why viz media why,ok i my self have been collecting the bleach box sets on a regular basest and all of them rite up to the first part of the aranncar ark have been worth there sticker price but at the regular price of 50$ viz is crazy to think we would pay that at full pricenot much on bonus features here this is how i decide on buy this box set is it cheaper then buying the dvds one by one well with a sell for 30$ its still cheaper then paying 20$ a dvd viz go back to 5 disc box sets please it is such a better deal then what your doing now
3,Not happy but...,"I'll still buy it, though I feel like they're taking for granted that collectors like me will simply let themselves be compelled to keep the set going.However, I will not be buying it at all if it remains Japanese-only as it appears to be. The rest are all dubbed but this one does not appear to be, unless Amazon simply forgot to add "", English"" to the product description."
1,Viz is a disgrace,"Bleach is one of my favorite shows, but this method of releasing it is bull. All of the real fans already bought either the singles (like I did) or the season sets, and wanted to complete the series in the same format. Canceling both of those lines to produce this cheaply packaged piece of trash is the most disgraceful, greedy thing I've seen an anime distributor do.I urge you to avoid supporting Viz at this point; tell them that being inconsistent (Bleach) and canceling shows altogether (Monster, Hikaru No Go) is unacceptable."
3,HALF BLEACH,"I LIKED IT, BUT IT WAS HALF ONLY AND HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL DECEMBER, BEING NOW SEPTEMBER, WHAT IT IS WRONG WITH YOU GUYS!!! (VIZMEDIA)."
1,"The show doesn't deserve a 1 Star, but this splitting up the season is awful.","I love bleach, I love it so incredibly much I have been buying the box sets as they come out even though I can watch them online. However, this is just horrendous. Bleach season 6 has 22 episodes, NOT 12. So what they are going to do yet again (just like they did in season 4) is split the season into 2 parts in order to make more money. Its atrocious and I couldn't be more angry about it. This part of season 6 will only have 12 episodes, the next part will have another 10. Its awful and I can't believe they are doing it yet again. Season 4 of Bleach titled The Bount had 27 episodes and they split those up into 2 sets each which cost [...] bucks at the time. The Bount one, kinda partially made sense but still angered me, but this Season 6 one I simply wont buy. [...] bucks for 12 episodes? I think not."
1,"Dear God, Cure them of their Greed","At first glance, looking at the packaging, I had no idea this product was a ""season"". Bestbuy, a major seller of DVDs, admitted that DVDs are a dying medium so why then would a company decide to jack up the cost of their DVDs? Greed? Yes, however there is a bigger issue. There is an unwillingness to lower cost and adapt to growing demands of online availability such as Netflix on Xbox 360. Instead of going digital, they jack up costs and force individuals to illegally stream repeat episodes on the internet.These anime/manga companies need to re-evaluate where they put their money. Check on sales of manga, of monthly manga magazines, of licensed merchandise. A lot of the consumers in this market are young, so why charge prices that require a salary?"
2,Gangsters,"Terrible movie - especially for Edward G. I like gangster movies, and this one was just too stupid to like. Not your typical E.G.R."
1,Gem Testing,"This was my first purchase from Amazon & it has been a terrible experience.The book that was advertised was not the book I received. It took a week for the seller to reply to my email saying that it was not correct and it has taken nearly four weeks to receive a refund and I will send the incorrect book back. The seller only wanted to give me 50% of my money back and hoped that I would keep it I think. I think it was very fraudulent.I will definately never buy anything from that seller again if I ever buy anything through Amazon again. This has made me very wary.I think that seller ""first trust 2003"" is a scammer to advertise a book for sale and then send an inferior edition which was much older, one obviously he had trouble selling and thought he could offload onto me.Well - NO WAYPlease publish my plight so everyone knows what this fraudulent person is up to."
2,"BAD, writing about reincarnation without writing about karma is half a$$ed...","A typical theosophist view, with the jargon and all. It is very short and very much in the style of the old lady HPB (i.e. unreadable); who by the way was a mentor to Bessant. Not a bad book for free - read it online, it is short enough, also terse, peppered with jargon the theosophists so love to use. In chapter what reincarnates? Monad etc. Why just not use English words and tell us, is it the Soul or the Spirit that reincarnates? This book will not inform you much. A far better and more comprehensive study on the subject is by the occult master and yogi Atkinson.REINCARNATION AND THE LAW OF KARMA"
1,Not Much Good,"UFO as they are famously renowned didn't get started until the ""Phenomenon"" album in 1974. Prior to that as a four piece the music was very different to that which followed despite three of the founder members still incumbent in today's line up. Call it space rock, ahead of it's time, psychedelic acid rock, heavy blues/early metal, 60's to 70's transition, call it whatever you like, it isn't any good."
1,horrible,The CD came cracked almost all the way through. Horrible seller. Don't Buy anything from them.
4,broke after 2 weeks,"My children (13,5) have wanted a trampoline for several years. We finally broke down and let the ""Easter Bunny"" bring us one! Not even two weeks later, all the straps that hold on the blue frame cover (padding that covers the springs) have ripped out. Now there is nothing holding it on the trampoline. This is NOT safe! I can not let my (very upset) children on it until I replace it.....we will see how the warranty is, and just how long I will have to wait."
2,Our Straps Busted Also,"I have the same problem as someone else has had. My straps have all ripped and I can't find my receipt. The straps were not very sturdy. Don't buy this if you have young children, find one that has better pad straps."
4,13 foot trampoline,This is our second Airzone trampoline. We repurchased after a strong wind took our first. My kids love it and I am also very pleased with the product and how well it is put together.
5,AIRZONE 12-FOOT SPRING TRAMPOLINE,SUPER EASY TO ASSEMBLE.VERY STURDY.WOULD'NT BE A BAD IDEA TO INSTALL A SAFETY ENCLOSURE ALSO.
4,"Good, inexpensive trampoline","Good and sturdy, easy to build. Inexpensive.Take care of it if it is outdoors, and it will last.Nothing fancy on it, but it is as good as any other trampoline."
2,Not that bouncy!,"I have been jumping on trampolines since I was a kid. I had one and my neighbors all had them too. I was excited to get this spring trampoline at a good price, but this is the least bouncy spring trampoline I have ever been on. It is put together properly and at first I thought it could be because I am an adult and weight more than I used to, but then I went to my cousins house and jumped on his trampoline and it is super bouncy and like the trampolines I remember. I am getting rid of mine and buying a good one. The Airzone one just isn't that fun."
3,bad delivery,"We love the trampoline. However, the company was very unhelpful when my order arrived without screws. When I called they sent the screws by regular mail and it took two weeks to get to me and when they did there were only 12 instead of 36. The box my trampoline was shipped in was so bad there was more tape holding it together than actual card board."
2,Collapsed after 1 year,"Bought the 14' AirZone as a Christmas for my daughter. Was quite a hit and saw lots of adult-supervised use. Noticed that the spring cover started breaking down in direct sunlight and that a few straps were tearing the first few weeks, but nothing major. A few months into its use the frame starting torquing and twisting. It eventually failed and collapsed after a year of use. A few of the legs sheared from the upper ring, snapping in various places. No one was hurt but they easily could have been."
2,Giant leap backwards,"Behrman's books are exactly what the writing experts tell us not to do: she presents children with fill-in-the-blanks and mindless prompts instead of developing independent, creative thinkers. Imagine filling in a Mad-Lib-like story and then being told ""complete the story on your own""? Why would a child want to complete something that another author began? Why would a good teacher think this is good teaching? A literature-rich environment, time to write in a safe, happy classroom with positive feedback and a good balance between skills and creative thinking is a better place to begin a writing program."
1,And the restaurant?,"Mostly trivial chit-chat on which liquors to purchase assorted with obvious stuff, like an item list including mustard! This book is not only parochially American (and this might perhaps justify the very heavy stress on beverage sales) but also essentially irrelevant to anybody who would like to start a gourmet restaurant, being instead perhaps useful to somebody who'd like to open a greasy spoon for heavy drinkers. If there were a money-back guarantee I sure would have used it, having made the mistake to purchase it."
1,waste of money waste of time,"Wow, I bought the book thinking it would be a helpful how-to-guide, it was more like a BAD novel of someone who had spent too much time in the deep under belly of New York. Don't waste your money or time on this one it's not one bit helpful. Amazon[.com] sells better books for a successful restaurant, I know I found one and this one was not it!"
2,"Not a ""How to"" book by any means.","While an occasionally entertaining read , it is essentially useless for anyone looking for a ""how to"" book. There are a few helpful hints in the book, but overall is a waste of time. I found myself hurrying to finish it to get a book that might be useful. At least it was cheap!"
1,Badly written,"I agree with the other review, just mundane chit chat. I wonder if the author has ever been in the back office of a real restaurant."
2,not long lasting,"Foremost, thank you for very quick shipping and good packaging. But! The pencil does not deliver whatsoever on it's long lastingness, starts melting under eyes within first half an hour. Better off buying Dior's waterproof, or Lancome makes one automatic as well. This one as if buying maybelline's waterproof pencil, only you are paying a lot more. I am sure this will not last in Chicago's humid 100 degrees summers, it doesn't even last in frigid Minnesota winters."
1,Not Absorbent,"They look nice, but the towels do not absorb much water. I am very disappointed. I suspect I'll use them a few times, then give them to Goodwill."
1,IN THE TOP TEN LIST FOR WORST MOVIES EVER!,"Now that I have stopped wretching, I feel I must share my views with the world about this POS. However, I do feel some relief in that I only rented it and did not purchase it. Yes, I was taken in by the flashy pictures and reviews contained on the video box. But the movie.... I'm sorry, I can't continue with this review because the mere thought of thinking about this film(?) makes me ill to the maximum. BE AFRAID!! BE VERY AFRAID!!"
2,A Time Machine that wastes it instead of gains.,"Although the writer of Time Machine had a good idea, he failed to follow it through the end. Which left us the audience with one word on our now befuddled minds. Huh?Yes Huh, for I couldn't make heads or tails of the movie, and boredom that ran through my foggy brain didn't help any. Yes the CGI was good, but does computer enhanced graphics really make up for bad story plots? The answer no, as this movie clearly shows us.A true rendition of H.G Wells story this is not, and for fans of his works I have to say don't bother with this movie. Wait a few more years until someone gets the right idea on how to follow through with Well's original story."
1,NOTHING to do with Wells' work!,"Once again a big FX budget makes dishwater of an excellent story. Although the 1960 version was romanced up and the ending made more blithe than the original book, it was --at heart--more true to Wells' work. Wells' story, however, is brilliant. From the UN-NAMED main characters to the horrific image at the story's close, the tale is a gripper. WHY OH WHY can't any director simply take a good story and let it tell itself? This version is laughable, pot-boiler, silly at times, and so full of over FX and over made up villains (who do NOT exist in a person in the orig.) that I nearly puked. I walked out on this film in the theatre."
1,Waste of time,"Unfortunately I cannot rate the DVD itself as I, happily, do not own it. I have, however, had the misfortune of seeing the movie and can say without a trace of remorse that this movie is abyssmal. There are so many solid time travel movies around. From the cryptic, beautiful, and thought provoking 12 Monkeys to the light-heartedness of movies like Back to the Future and Tenchi Muyo in Love. Even Terminator 2 had fewer plot holes or, at the least, excuses itself from reality with genuine entertainment. I can't recommend this movie less, even with it's stunning special effects and reasonable cast. Guy Pearce and Jeremy Irons are usually dependable fellows but they seem to be stuck in the wrong place at the wrong time."
2,If you've got nothing better to do,"This is a remake of a pretty good 1960 film version of the H G Wells story. Guy Pierce stars in the leading role. Now Guy Pierce isn't a bad actor, but here is given an impossible job. At the start of the film he is the obsessed Prof. Hartdegen who just happens to on the verge of building a time machine. He has a sweetheart of course and after an evening in the park he has recourse to use the machine. From then on its downhill all the way as Hartdegen changes from a somewhat reclusive Prof. into an Indiana Jones type character.Add to this magical transformation a frequently vomit-making musical soundtrack and overall you have a film that really should only be watched if you have nothing better to do. There are worse films for sure, but this certainly lacks any of the charm of the original and has even less to with the book. Result - only buy if they are giving it away!"
2,What was the point?,"I rented this movie thinking it was going to be enjoyable, boy was I wrong. The special effects were cool, but the story went nowhere. I usually can follow plots and storylines, even the really complex ones, but this one was beyond me. Maybe I'm wrong, but I highly encourage you not to buy, rent or see this movie."
1,Did he read the book?,"This is not a good movie at all. I honestly believe Simon Wells did not read the book his grandfather wrote! He looked up a 5 sentence outline of the book and filled in the rest with his ideas.Now the movie included some special effects, but I don't agree with the majority who say that they are so amazing.If you have not read the book, this movie may appeal to you, because you have no idea what the story is all about.I have read reviews that the book could not be made into a good movie, so this adaptation is good. However I completely disagree. The book is much more compelling with much better imagery than the movie includes.Skip the movie, read the book!"
2,was this a 'Made for TV' movie?,"I missed this film when it was in the theaters, and finally added it to my Netflix queue this past weekend, only to be disappointed. In the initial scenes during the late 1800's, the scenery and the time machine itself looked good, and I had no complaints. But then the ""future"" scenes and cheap visual effects started coming, culminating in a not-so-tribal group of future homosapiens where, apparently, makeup and hip hair fashion will still be of utmost importance. And for a tribe of regularly roughed-up, victims-of-underground-dwelling-cannibals, their outfits wouldn't be so clean-pressed. I think this film was mis-labeled from the low-budget Saturday afternoon movie on the WB that it is."
1,HG Wells would have used a time machine,"I think H.G. Wells would have used his time machine to travel forward into the future to stop the making of this disappointment. What a horrible thing to do to a classic. The original story line, coupled with modern special effects would have been a real masterpiece. Some scenes were good, some of the action was good, and the special effects were great, but in the end it just wasn't The Time Machine."
3,Not bad especially if you like special effects,"This movie wasn't bad. It was a more plausible remake compared to the remake of The Planet of the Apes. If your into special effects, then you should enjoy this movie more so than the original. I would rent it before I bought it. For me the original was better, of course."
2,Don't wast your time,"Like the previous (& superior film starring Rod Taylor -also an Australian), this film only partly follows the excellent H G Wells book. Only in this film a large chunk is devoted to a pre-story trying to explain why Guy Pearce invents the time machine in the first place.This film has many stupid plot twists - why would a cannibalistic Morlock let Guy Pearce walk away (instead of eating him perhaps)?Even the star, Guy Pearce said that this film is terrible."
4,I Actually Liked this Movie,"Yes, Pal's version is a classic and you can't get a more rugged heroic type than a young Rod Taylor. But I actually like this movie. It has heart. Pierce's character is driven by more than a quest for science it is emotionally personal. Nice effects and a good action film. It isn't a classic, true. It's a popcorn picture. Sometimes people take these sort of things way too seriously. It's science fiction. There is NOTHING in science fiction literature that can stand alongside the great works of all time. So check your disbelief at the door and you'll be entertained."
1,Disappointed,"With all the hype this movie had, it was one of the biggest disappointments ever. Two hours of my life that i wish i had back."
1,Better SFX does not equal better story,"OK...I'll be fair. The SFX were astonishing. But if you want quality storytelling, stick with the George Pal version. THAT version has charm! This newer version does not. Not recommended."
1,sabotage,a total sabotage of the authors intent the only resembelence between this movie and the book is the stolen title.and maby some of the charictors.check out the 1960 version for a good idea!
5,Why can the past be changed,"Alexander Hartegen is a scientist who decides to build a ""Time Machine"" after his fiancée is killed during a robbery. It takes a few years, but he does build his machine and goes back to change the past but in preventing one accident another occurs and his fiancée still dies. At that point he decides to go into the future to figure out why he can't change the past. As he travels forward in time he stop at various points along the way and at one point the moon is half destroyed. Alexander receives a bump on the head and travels 800,000+ years into the future where he meets the Eloi and as in the original Time Machine the Morlocks are there.There are some nice visual effects in the movie:-The homes of the Eloi are attached to the sides in a large canyon.-The half-destroyed moon in orbit is fantastic.-The time machine is state of the art."
4,Great update,This was a great update of the timeless classic. I didn't care for the way it ended as it effectively ends the story with no hope of a sequel or series spring off. I would've liked to see a lot more.
4,Improves on the original,"It's not very often that a remake outshines the original. The Time Machine (2002) is one of those rare films. The original is good and a hoot to watch, but the newer version simply improves on it in every way, e.g., script, special effects, score, action and good old-fashioned ""heart"". Guy Pearce is always good and as Alexander, he brings a depth to the lead character that truly draws you in to the pain and desperation of his situation. Great fun all the way around! A film that pretty much the whole family could enjoy together. Thumbs up!"
2,I Don't Get It,"This movie was choppy to say the least, the story itself is intreguing however it's too choppy, not a whole lot of explanation going on there. However with a story of that magnitude and a running time of only 90 minutes, there's not a whole lot you can do. It seems like they spent their whole budget on the ""Time Machine"" prop rather then story editors.It's not bad, but it could have been WAY better!"
2,Not worth it,"This movie was in one word ""Terrible."" I watched the movie after having read the book and was utterly disappointed. Apparently Simon Wells (the director) had no intention to preserve the plot of the book. He added characters (Emma) and changed the appearance of the Eloi - just to name a few minor details. In addition to the disparities between the book and the plot, the appearance of the Morlocks in the movie was almost fake (think Congo). The only bright spots in the movie were the acting of Jeremy Irons (Uber-Morlock) and the beautiful women - Sienna Guillory and Samantha Mumba. Not only would I not go buy a ticket in the movie theater to rent this, I wouldn't even rent it on video. I think there are other versions which I understand are better."
2,Not an improvement on the original...,"I was very disappointed in this movie as well; the only thing that I enjoyed were the special effects, but it wasn't as good as the original. Maybe they should have left well enough alone."
2,"I really WANTED to like it, but...","H.G. Wells story, great cast, big Hollywood budget -- what more could you ask for, right? A lot, as it turns out.Costumes, historical sets, special effects, and supporting performances were all brilliant. For a while, in fact, it seemed like this was going to be a good movie.Then it... drifted... It drifted into ghastly political correctness. It drifted into sets that didn't seem plausible with the story line, and less-than-stunning monster effects (where's Rick Baker when you need him?). Then it ended with a huge, ridiculous, totally unbelievable twist that must have H.G. Wells rolling over in his grave.What can I say? Read the book."
2,Overrated,I did not see this movie until two weeks ago. Now I know why I did not see it in 2002. The story line was the typical guy trying to forget girl and moves on (with some unwanted help) through time encountering one global disaster after another and finally when the rest of the human race is a bunch of pansies our pansy traveler becomes the half hearted macho guy to the rescue. That's another thing about the movie that stinks- pansies don't build time machines! None of the characters were very interesting except for the mutant people eating underground dwellers but that angle has been overdone beyond belief.I guess I was expecting much more and disappointed myself. The story line had far more potential than was allowed. Hopefully nobody is purchasing this movie except from the $1.00 bin at fine retailers everywhere.
2,What Were They Thinking?,"The new version of The Time Machine was amazingly silly! Even the talents of Jeremy Irons couldn't save this script. The movie kept the basic of the original HG Wells Story but forgot the most important part - having characters we like. They did adjust the story a little bit.The special effects were state of the art, of course, but that didn't help the lack of feeling and compassion this script had. The sets were grand and the Time Machine itself had an interesting design, but the movie lacked a lot. I just can't find a lot of good things to say about this one. The performance was by the best friend - Fred Flintstone himself in The Flintstone Viva Rock Vegas and The Full Monty's - Marc Addy.This is not something I would recommend seeing in the theatre. I will definitely rent it on the DVD went it is available later this summer. It may work much better on the small screen because if bombed on the big one!"
2,I like the original better.,"This movie is an adaptation of the original 1960 movie. I watched it in the theater a few months ago. Guy Pearce plays a time traveler who must go back in time in order to prevent the death of his fiancee. She was killed the first time by a robber and the second time she was ran over by an automobile. This segment of the movie somehow was badly made that instead of engrossing the audience with a sense sadness and despair, it turned the movie into a semi-comedy. The rest of the movie was then the Guy character went into the far future where he must save a docile tribe from a group of carnivores (evolved humans). Some segments of the movie are confusing. I think it could have been done a lot better. Sorry, only two stars for this one."
3,**THIS REVIEW IS ONLY FOR THE DVD,"The extras are great on this DVD, worth it because this is the only edition so far (lets hope for a Gold Edition). The extras incluse all:*Creating the time Machine Featurette- See how the dynamic change in time was created as the films centerpiece*Creating the Morlocks featurette on the visual effects*Original Storyboards*Commentary by: Simon Wells, Wayne Wahrman*Deleted Scenes"
1,WASTE OF TIME,"The WORST movie in the world! I wouldn`t know where to begin. . I really wanted to see it when it came to theaters, but waited until the dvd release. I was in shock at how badly it was made. It would be a waste of my time and yours to write the review it deserves. Just do not see it!"
4,An entertaining ride from beginning to end.,"Guy Pearce is a scientist who develops a time machine to save his ill-fated fiancee. Unfortunately, disaster strikes again, and he heads toward the future, only to discover human society is doomed. Modern adaptation of H.G. Wells classic novel isn't very faithful to its source, but remains a fairly spirited and always enjoyable sci-fi adventure. Plot holes are abound, logic is questionable at best, and the movie somehow loses some momentum when it kicks 800,000 years(!) into the future, but Pearce's likeable performance, the intriguing story, and competent direction keeps this film surging forward. On a technical level, the special effects and score are both effective, the former sometimes being even quite spectacular, as seen in the time-traveling sequences .*** 1/2 out of *****"
3,A typical re-make,"5 out of 5 for the special (audio and video) effects, but only 2 stars for acting and story. Enjoyed the 1960 original much more."
3,Terrible!!,"The remake of the original Classic, ""The Adventures Of The Time Machine"" by H.G Wells is an unsuccessful attempt to put the contents of the book into a motion picture. The story starts of well, but as the movie progresses, reality takes a new turn. The monsters or whatever they are called, give an eeire feel to the entire movie. It was then when I realized that this movie is terrible. Okay, some appreceation now. The Computerized graphics are beautiful and so are the sound effetcs. But the movie looses its charm due to its unauthenticity."
3,Could have been worse,"Its always a shame to see such lavish special effects spent on a mediocre movie. I haven't seen the original in a long time but as far as I can tell this is a scene-for-scene remake.The effects are impressive; the music is overpowering, intrusive and just plain awful. On the plus side, there are a few attempts at ""humour"".As big Summer movies go it could have been much worse."
1,Imagine this . . .,"Some Hollywood screenwriter has an idea: Let's make a film based on HG Wells's TIME MACHINE. ONLY, instead of England, let's set it in Iceland. Instead of an inventor, the hero is a bus driver and , oh cool! He drives his BUS into the future so he can find out who will win the Latin Grammy award. ONly, in the future there are these gangs of girls who force you to dress like Madonna because, well, because they WaNT to make you do it and then There is a big Crash or explosion, and some Monster, and a fast car . . . ANYWAY, it all ends on Hollywood Boulevard and N'Sync are there and Mr T and Pamela Lee and, maybe we can get George Bush to make a speech about Iraq? Anyway, we'll call it THE TIME MACHINE! [HG, I am SOOOOOO SORRY nad apologizefor my era]"
2,Horrible Remake,"This movie should have H. G. Wells turning in his grave. I thought this would be a hi-tech remake of the original Rod Taylor flick. However the plot was thin, no character development to speak of, a vague story line and the ending was very disappointing. I will say that the special effects, visuals, sound etc. were good, however the movie falls on its face. Unfortunately, I bought this DVD without first reading the reviews here on .... I could have saved myself [$$$]. Maybe worth the rental price, but not worth purchasing."
3,Outdated and outclassed,"In 1960, the concept of producing a movie following the story of H.G. Well's Time Machine was a good one. And in that era the movie was a stand out.However, what this 2002 remake has to compete with are all the great sci-fi and futuristic dramas that have been produced since that time like the Star War series, Blade Runner, The Fifth Dimension, Star Trek the movies and television series, and many more. Quite frankly this film does not measure up. The devise, a time machine, simply provides a reason for futuristic travel. Most other futuristic movies do not need a time machine. The adventure 800,000 years into the future provides the viewer with little more than seen in ""Escape from New York"". And many other recently produced movies come to mind when I view ""The Time Machine"".The film moves quickly and is entertaining on that count but it could be said that it moves too quickly to supply drama. So if one likes drama, it is not here."
2,See the 1960 Version Instead,This remake is easy to forget. Do yourself a favor and see the 1960 George Pal version instead. It is vastly superior.
2,"800,000 years into the future? Nonsense!","The movie is another recent (Queen of the Damned) poor book's adaptation. Guy Pierce is better to play a villain than a hero. The settings for the future world to come is decent but who will believe the earth could survive the Moon's destruction. And even if it did, how come some (extremely beautiful) people survived intact on the surface of the Earth while others needed to hide below it mutating into brainless (or brainstorming) canibalistic creatures. Sure, H.G. Wells book covers some of this stuff, but the the fashion the movie is trying to paint the evolution doesn't have any sense. If you need to watch this movie, wait until it's on free TV. Don't waist money on rental, and definitely do not buy DVD."
2,Bleh,You'd think someone who knows enough about time to create a machine to travel it would know the answer to the question he keeps asking before he even started making his rediculous machine. This movie could have been much better if it didn't assume the audience was stupid.
2,Interesting premise,"Well it starts out interesting enough when his fiance gets murdered and he builds his time machine to go back in time to change this horrible accident. But then it just goes a little haywire. What I mean is that he goes forward in time to figure out why he can't change the past....sounds good, but he goes WAY forward in time. And this is a place that no movie's ever been to and now I know why.Guy Pearce is good, not great, maybe another actor could have held me through the movie better, but it's just the second half of this movie that's got me in a state of fluster. Best part I must say was Jeremy Irons, though he never ceases to amaze.Still interesting, the concept of time travel is a complete mystery, and this movie won't solve it any time soon."
2,the new time machine,"Take a time machine back to the original is my advise. The original is far superiour. The only thing better was the morlocks. Guy pierce's performance is bad, his character isnt nearly as likeable as rod taylors in the original. The Effects are cool but it's not enough to save this movie. Buy the original!!"
2,This is a real dud.,"Yeesh. I mean, I expected this remake of the old H. G. Wells sci-fi classic to be kinda not good, but I never expected it would be this bad. Why would anyone want to make something this lame? Even the special effects -- which one would assume would be the film's sole saving grace -- are pretty cheesy. Oh, well. Too bad nobody can go back into the past and prevent this film from ever having been made."
1,A horrible remake of a classic,Everything about this dull movie is inferior to the 1960 George Pal version. What were the filmmakers thinking? I dare anyone to think this version is as good.
2,the time machine,this movie started out with such potential for a good story and special effects. then a third of the way into the movie it got bogged down with an utterly stupid plot and died there. what a waste of what could have been a fantastic movie.
4,"Not the original story, but a nice movie","Despite I read the story of ""The Time Machine"" many years ago, it was still fresh in my memory when I watched this movie. Of course I was expecting some changes to adapt the original story to both a screen and to us viewers of this century, but I was somehow surprised when the movie showed its *reason* to build the time machine up. This was not in the original story.However, this did not affect badly the flow of the story, but all the opposite: it was not only the reason to build up the machine, but also the reason for almost every thing that happens in the movie.The middle part is just nice. The director's efforts to adapt the story for our time have a good outcome. Oh, and the movie gets somehow back to the book.At the end I was again expecting some changes but then there was a big, big one; but a good one. You could say it's another story, but you will enjoy it."
2,This Movie could of been better,Well to say the least I was pretty disappointed in the way this Movie was Directed. I wouldn't blame Pearce totally for a bad acting job in this one because the movie was severly rushed. The Characters and Story never had anytime in this Movie to Develop into anything. And the Special Effects could of been a lot better especially with the Technology the Movie Makers have today and the Budget they put into this Flick. If they would of taken the time and let the story and characters Develop(like making the Movie about 2- 2 1/2 hours long) then this movie would of been better. Too bad though this could of been a Better movie if it was Directed right. The only thing that saves this flick from total .... is Guy Pearce.
2,Poor Adaption,"If you are looking for a good adaption of H.G. Wells, The Time Machine, please look elsewhere. The movie does not try to stay true to the book in the slightest bit. Other than the special effects, which is nothing new, this movie does not bring much to the table. The ending was rushed, and did not appear to be thought out or explained. Overall, I turned off my TV disappointed when the movie ended, almost to the point of being mad."
2,Rent it first,"I consider myself a fan of sci-fi/fantasy stories but I found this movie laughable. The first 1/3 of the movie looked promising but the plot just took a nosedive. It just reminded me of one of those hokey sci-fi channel shows that never became successful, or an episode of the Twilight Zone which got scrapped.Unless you're a diehard sci-fi geek don't buy this movie, rent it first."
2,Buy it only for the effects,Effects were top notch ... story line a little long and not very dramatic. The CGI effects were fantastic and well worth a look. My advice is buy it for the effects and then lend it to your friends !!!!!
3,Original was better ??? LET'S BE SERIOUS !!!,"First off anyone here that isn't on social security that says the original movie was better , needs to up their medication ... I am a huge Movie Buff ... And, yes there may be some areas in the film that aren't the greatest thing that could have been done to match our opinions of what we personally want. But as far as a remake of a less than desirable original this is leaps and bounds above that . The original "" Time Machine "" Sucked ... Go watch it then make up your own mind .. For people who like movies at least see it once, you'll be entertained ... 8>)"
2,don't think so,goods: Guy Pearcebads: everything elsethe actors & director's don't even know what this was about.overall: no thanks
5,The Time Machine,Had this on DVD before and my daughter loaned it and it never came back so I purchased again. Sot that should tell you I loved it!
5,Fantastic Movie,"Always wanted to add this to my library. Arrived sooner than expected. Great condition. Movie is very good, the first Time Machine movie is the best though. Very satisfied."
2,Why does everyne feel they must ruin H.G. Wells books?,"There's not much I can say that others have not. It seems H.G.Wells is no longer taken seriously in cinema. In my opinion, Dr. Moreau was horrible, as was this movie. The only Wells movie I've found enjoyable is The War of The Worlds. Ths movie starts out great. I began to think, oh, how sweet, it's going to be a nice love story, but no, it starts that way, then he basically says 'forget it, let's doing something else with this thing.'He then travels 800000 years in to the future, and that my friends, is where it goes not just down hill, but to the very bottom of the ocean. From then on it seems like one of the cheap movies you would find on the SciFi channel that a person would only watch to LAUGH at.Spare yourselves unless you enjoy horrible, cheap remakes, of something that mixes Xena, Beastmaster, and planet of the apes, to become one horrible blended barfbag."
2,Not worth your time,"Boy, this left me hanging. I kept homeing something better would happen, something to build on what going to be pretty interesting if it kept up. Jeremy Irons was very good, I liked him, but expected more. It seemed like everyone was playing bit parts. I have yet to read the book, but expect it is better than this. Also, the way they made part of it sound, it was some terrible secret waiting to be explored, but I never figured it out. What were they babbleing about? The world may never know, because i don't think the director does."
2,The Special Effects OK. Where's the Story?,Guy Pearce hardly broke a sweat in this one and minimal supporting cast meant alot of special effects. Some interesting new concepts were raised but never developed. Morlocks looked like they came from Planet of the Apes. It's a toss up for which movie was the most boring and both were pretty short.
2,"Lacking in charm, untrue to original story","This 2002 cinematic version, supposedly of H.G. Wells time machine, is totally lacking in any of the charm of the 1960 version. As another viewer pointed out: H.G.Well's story is social commentary, and like the writings of Dickens, stands the test of time while pointing out the continued failings of humanity. To claim this cannot be protrayed in a movie version has as much truth as saying Citizen Cane whould have been better to avoided the subjects of greed, corruption, and averarice. Skip this version - buy the 1960 version."
2,See the original instead!!,"Yes, the special effects here are state of the art, but that's about it. The first 20 minutes or so are actually an improvement over the 1960 film; they give the character some more depth. But after that, the film begins to fizzle, and quickly. The eloi aren't depicted as Wells intended them, and what should have been the most fascinating and enjoyable part of the film -- the changes around him as he travels through time -- were severely limited and truncated. Jeremy Irons role was almost unnecessary, as was Orlando's. Nice try, but it didn't work, guys. The nod to the original w/ an Alan Young cameo was a nice touch, though."
3,"Watch something else for quality, watch this for fun.","Oookay...Take it easy everyone. Why so much hate for this film?This is science fiction at its best. Cheesy? Check! Bad acting? Check! Creatures? Check! Awesome special effects? Check! (kinda reminds me of that 'masterpiece' Attack of the Clones, not worth the film it was printed on, but extremely enjoyable nevertheless). Who gives a crap whether or not it has a plot? It's damn fine entertainment. And lay off Guy Pearce. I never thought he was painful to watch in any of his prior films- Priscilla/LA Confidential/Memento. Honestly, were you all expecting something better? In my opinion (and thank god I am entitled to one) this movie reeked in a good way (unlike 'planet of the apes', which smelled too bad to excuse). I really enjoyed it as much as I did ""I know what you did last summer"" and I am an adult who is not afraid to admit that sometimes my brain needs a break."
2,Missed by a long shot...,"This 2002 new version missed the whole point of the story. It's just another computerized action movie. If you are young and had never read the book or seen the older version with Robert Taylor, than this might be a fun movie for you. That's the reason for the two stars. I would have given it only a one star rating."
3,Intersting remake,"Although I prefer the original edition of The Time Machine, this one is also quite interesting. It tries to differentiate itself from the original but also stays true to the book and for that it deserves merit. The special effects, directing and acting are done well- the fourth star is lost though because I thought that it could have been better done- a testiment to this is the fact that it was not a box office hit. However it is worth seeing especially if you are a sci-fi fun."
2,What a disappointment..........,"I am a fan of the 1960s George Pal classic movie and when I saw the preview of the 2002 remake I couldn't wait to see it. Unfortunately this movie was a complete disappointment. Where do I start?, well, The storyline is completely different than the book and the 1960s original. The movie has no scientifical explanation and/or fascination regarding time travel in general. The soundtrack does not draw you in. I get the feeling that this film was a quick put togheter project rushed out to the big screen hoping to make it big relying on the success and the following of the original movie. The only thing I liked was the actual machine, althought not as stylish and elegant as the original it is nevertheless a beautiful piece of machinery, more on the mechanical side than the classic one. Overall: MEDIOCRE."
2,Buy the original,Do yourself a favor and buy the original Time Machine (1960) starring Rod Taylor. It's a far better adaption of the HG Wells novel.
3,A fun flick,"I really enjoyed watching this film. While it does not use mant of the ""little"" things that made the novel or original film enjoyable, I found that I could just sit back and enjoy it as a story. Great music, good effects, and some good acting performances; (Guy Pearce did a terrific job) This newest version of The Time Machine will probably dissapoint hard core Wells fans, and those who expect movies to more closely follow the book; but if you just want to spend a couple hours watching a fun story, this is a good one to pick."
2,To Slow,"This movie spends way to much time developing why and how the main character (Guy Pearce) wants to create a time machine. Who cares! Move on into the reason we want to watch the movie, sci-fi action. By the time we get to the conflict there is no time left to have an exciting, plausible resolution. Unfortunately, I'm sorry I spent the time watching. I did like the main characters."
3,The Time Machine - Not a movie to watch Twice,"I saw this movie first at the Theaters! I have to say that I liked it, actually I loved it... A half year later it came out on DVD; I bought it the second it came out. I was so excited to see it again... I didn't liked it as much as the first time. It wasn't the same! I knew what would come; after that I watched it again, but my conclusion didn't change... I don't have that with other movies like 'the Omen', I watched that movie almost 6 times, I still love it. So don't buy this DVD, go rent it and never see it again, you'll love it the first time!!"
3,"Flawed, Yet Moving. Great Music.","I found this movie to be disappointing with its story, yet I came away liking it a lot. The earlier movie tied the past and future together in a more coherent manner. Yet, I found myself surprisingly moved by the love story aspect. The flower conversation that tied future to past actually made me gasp, which I'd never done before. The future gets quite weird, and I get the feeling that something was omitted from the story which might have filled in the gaps better.The best part of the movie is the music, which has echoes of Star Trek + Titanic + Enya. I listen to the soundtrack CD over and over. Maybe that's why I found the movie more moving than its story deserves. The time travel sequences are terrific, and the machine itself is a worthy homage to the first movie."
3,It's fun to watch at least,"This film had the tables stacked against it from the start. It would be hard to outdo the original movie. I don't think this film outdoes that film, but on its own, this film is fun to watch and kept my interest. The CGI effects are amazing. It wal like watching a dream at times. The camerawork is very good. The shots are well laid out and very attractive. Maybe that is the best part of the whole movie. The extra features on the disc are lacking. Still, the movie is worth seeing on an afternoon you have nothing else to do. Maybe a date movie."
4,Lovely songs,"I was in India when the movie was released a couple of months ago, and saw and heard for myself what a buzz this movie and the songs created. The buzz was based on 2 factors. The first is that the music is based on the works of the late music director Madan Mohan, and the second was that Lata Mangeshkar who just turned 75 has sung about 9 of those songs. (I am not a big fan of Lata, I prefer Asha Bhonsle instead). Not all the songs are good, but on the whole this is a good music album."
4,Nice toy for Simpsons Fans,"I bought this for my husband, but it's a great toy for any Simpson fan. I enjoyed the fact that it had two Smithers - one as Bobo and one as future Smithers. The voice/talking component is a little weak and finicky - I would not suggest this for younger people."
5,Awesome facial cleanser for men and women,"Excellent non drying facial cleanser. Good lather and excellent pre shave. Expensive, but worth it because very little goes a long way."
1,I expect much more for $120,"Maybe the GUI is great. Maybe the calendar-sharing features are great within the tiny enclave of NUDC users cloistered in various organizations. But when a groupware product can't do basic things like publishing iCalendar or Free/Busy files and querying LDAP servers for contact information (c'mon, even Microsoft's products can do that!), it's next to worthless in my book. Why even have the groupware features? The server daemons are nothing but flaky, hog the CPU, collapse under load. My advice? Stick with free/open source alternatives that are standards-based and won't leave you stranded on a calendaring island."
1,Amazon lets me know 5 days later it's not in stock !!!,"I ordered this on a Tuesday, was told it wouldn't ship until wednesday and that I wouldn't get it until the following Monday (I had opted for slow-boat shipping as i was to be out of town for a few days).So on Sunday evening Amazon sends me a message saying that it was out of stock and I should reorder at a later date.WTF? It WAS in stock when I ordered it. Also, Amazon could have let me know WAY SOONER that it was not in stock.I'll never even go back to the Amazon site other than to use it for price checking, certainly never to order anything from them.Pissed in Florida......."
3,seems okay but i lost interest,"I lost interest halfway through this book. It's not bad, but I guess I was expecting starting with more conversational phrases instead of rules of language. There were a lot of exercises for which I would flip back to try to figure out what each word meant and occasionally get frustrated when a new word not previously defined was introduced. Sorry I didn't finish it. I will bring it on my trip though."
1,Not very recommended .,"I have bought this book so my wife could learn Turkish.Turkish is my native language and from what I saw, there is no way to learn Turkish properly from this book. The example sentences make no sense. It looks like a computer translated the sentences to Turkish and nobody edited them. It definetly needs a native person's editing so the sentences make some sense."
3,You have to be smart,"It's a Turkish grammar, rather than a primer for a complete beginner.It was written for Princeton students who must be a very intelligent bunch. Sometimes the English is hard to follow and you have to be smart to understand it.. It's full of sentences like ""the infinitives - common or light- may govern the objective definite suffix , or other appropriate suffixes, on preceding substantives, just as do finite verb forms."" and ""the common infinitive with the following combinations of two suffixes (1) the ablative suffix (2) the conditional suffix, means.....""It may be a little out of date. It says the lira contains a hundred kurus. Maybe things move slowly in Princeton.I think it might be helpful for someone who had learned to talk Turkish in an ungrammatical way - maybe lives in Turkey- and wanted to become more correct. There are no tapes."
2,Very outdated!!,"I am a native Turkish speaker and I bought this book for my really good Canadian friend who got interested in the language. This book has been written by a person who have lived in mid 60's and hasn't been updated since apparently. There are phrases and words (mostly words that have Arabic or Farsi roots that got replaced by modernized Turkish ones) in this book, that are not used in daily life anymore. An example to such phrase is ""How many bulbs are there in your radio?"" The book still may be good for learning the grammar (can't comment on that since I only glanced through it), but in terms of learning recent vocabulary and phrases that wouldn't sound make you sound funny, it is not the best reference."
5,fantastic,"I am a postal clerk for U.S.P.S. and I work on a letter sorting machine (DBCS) and the scooter has absolutely helped me. If you do a lot of bending and stooping, this scooter can save you."
2,Review of Theory and Technique of Ballroom Dancing,"I found the book informative on the most of the basic steps in ballroom dancing, but it is quite thin and a bit old. There are no illustrations and it also lacks a section on the Viennese Waltz."
4,"Lanny Cordola ""Shack of Peasants"" era Christmas album","If you like Lanny Cordolla's acoustic music (think ""Shack of Peasants), you'll like this Christmas cd as well.The acoustic songs on this disc are what you'd expect to hear from Cordolla's music of that time, and the songs with vocals feature his cast of vocalists of that era as well (Phil Bardowell, for example).I've owned this cd for more than 15 years now, and along with the Bruce Cockburn christmas album, this is one that I look forward to pulling out every holiday season. It's quite different than the usual ""Adult Contemp"" Christmas music that you hear all over the airwaves and in the stores this time of the year, and that's exactly what I like about it.I just noticed that it's around $5 here on Amazon, for that price, it's a must."
5,Amazing Film!,"Feels like Frank Capra meets Twilight Zone. Favorite film from the festival circuit this year. Must see! Epic score, beautifully shot, tight script."
5,Fantastic Film!,"I love this film! I have seen it twice on the big screen. First at The Phoenix Film Festival where it won Best Picture and Best Director! Very well deserved prizes I might add. Then at Phoenix Comicon where it was the opening night film of the Comicon Film Festival!The film makes me think of a cross between an episode of The Twilight Zone and the film: Memento! The theatrical version was in Black and White. It was truly meant to be seen in Black and White. The DVD has both a black and white and color version. I recommend watching the black and white first!The Writer, Director, Composer Kurt Kuenne is extremely talented at what he does. He pays a great attention to detail. Additionally, T.J. Thyne is perfect as the lead actor in Shuffle."
3,An OK Vocabulary Book,"I think this book is a good practice for vocabulary but some of the exercises in each unit are absolutely useless waste of time. I alternate this book with another vocabulary book ""240 Vocabulary Words: 6th Grade 'Kids Need to Know', which is a much better workbook in my opinion."
3,"Funny, and easy to read","This book deals with the life of a 5th grade tom boy who has a crush a boy, but won't admitt it."
1,Don't bother.......,"The original ALBUM, not cd, had a song called 'Trip To My House' by The THINGS. Why was it excluded from this re-issue? It was by far the best song on all the BOTG albums. The THINGS were the best band on the Voxx label and yet they seem to be overlooked time and time again by the label heads. They still think that us 80's psychedelic fans want to listen to those cheesy Seeds ...types ...such as ""Tell-Tale Hearts,"" ""Gravedigger 5,"" ""Untold Fables,"" and YES, ""The Pandoras."" The Pandoras? Not only were they talentless musicians, most of the songs that they claimed to have written can be found on the Pebbles albums released by Bomp. Give me The THINGS, Dream Syndicate, Three O'Clock, and YES, early Bangles anyday over this goofy collection of rubbage. Battle of the Garages? Yup, my garage is a mess too!"

2,Giorgio is the father of Techno,"Giorgio is the father of Techno, no doubt... but the short tracks on this CD were disappointing for the price paid. Not to mention the flat sound quality. Back in those days, long play dance tracks was not the norm for album compilations. Might I suggest that somebody out there pump up and flesh out some of the pieces with their own techno wizardry. There's a lot of potential. It would be a wonderful tribute to Giorgio Moroder."
2,A disappointment,"The first album I had heard from Moroder was Donna Summer's ""Once Upon A Time"". What cool synthesizer sounds and excellent melody, I thought - especially the haunting, melancholic synthesizer instrumental part between ""Now I Need You"" and ""Midnight Shift"".I thought I'd get more of the same kind of stuff in this album - more rich, harmonious synthesizer glory. But this was something else.The album is a non-stop compilation which doesn't even change the beat. Most of the songs are bland and empty compared to those in Once Upon A Time. There are some nice touches here and there, but overall I got the feeling there was simply something missing. The singing - since it's not by Donna Summer, but by some less known vocalists - isn't too flashy either.I was disappointed."
4,"From here to Eternity, By Giorgio Moroder",I like this music. It reminds of of the disco days. Nice to listen to.
1,Broken Logic,"I don't understand how people can find these movies funny.I enjoy a crude comedy as well as the high-brow stuff, having been raised on ANIMAL HOUSE and CADDYSHACK and AIRPLANE!But the Broken Lizard movies are just lame and laughless. I realize that humor is very subjective...but these movies are horrible. I laughed once in SUPER TROOPERS (that's one more laugh than I had for THE WATERBOY or any Kevin Smith film). I've caught most of CLUB DREAD on cable and, though the blonde chick is smokin' hot, the movie just lays there like a dead teen in a slasher film.Their latest film, BEER FEST or something, is being advertised as a worthy successor to SUPER TROOPERS, CLUB DREAD and Broken Lizard's last masterpiece, THE DUKES OF HAZZARD.At least they're consistent."
1,Epic Stupidity! This is a Rent-And-Fast-Forward Movie.,"When the preview aired, I was pushing the movie to all my friends, based on the hilarity of the preview. At that time, I skeptically said, ""I hope these don't turn out to be the only funny parts."" and that was exactly what happened. The rest of the movie was full over overdone gross jokes, crass humor that went way over the line and kept running. The pee joke was funny once, but even at that one time they overdid it, then overdid it again, and then again. The Harry Potter parts were hilarious! Jack Sparrow was awesome! But I wished I had not been forced to watch the rest of the crap just to see a few funny parts of the movie. It's another Scary Movie (1) deal, only worse! I love the newest Scary Movies, they are funny, but 1 really sucked. It was funny now and then, but a lot of it was stupid. So is Epic Movie, only worse. Don't waste your money buying it. Rent and fast forward."
3,"Fair, But.....The combination of Death Metal/Hardcore Gabber/Techno Dont all mix well","You would think that you would be in for a treat if you an fan of both Death Metal and Hardcore Gabber/Techno. The problem with this album is that many of the bands styles and vocal ranges dont really mix well with the electronic frenzy that we have on this CD. The first two tracks with featuring Naplam Death and Morbid Angel are slop, and even though I love both bands, the vocal style for Napalm Death and Morbid Angel sound horrid with the electronic music that the vocal is incorperated with. In fact, there are few tracks here that really offer anything unique, as the best tracks are the ones that stay away from vocal sampling, and use more of a variety and instruments. Its not a total bust, and considering its under a buck, I would say its fair, and you will get at least a few good songs here. Dont expect anything ground-breaking or unique though. ENJOY"
2,Is this HARD?,"When I read the review of this album in a magazine it supposed to be the hardest and darkest music ever made. This got me really excited, to hear the CD. The first two songs are great, but after that it goes downhill. This is not the hardest music ever made, sometimes it is pure noise. I give it 2 stars for the first 2 numbers, the rest doesnt deserve any."

4,Sea Hunt TV Series (24 Hour Marathon,What a hoot ! Exactly as I remember it... Full of adventure and intrigue! Its a must see for all my friends from the greatest generation.
4,Decent Show,I had never seen the show before until 'This Network' started showing it at 4 am (I work nights so I watch it on my nights off). It is interesting to see Lloyd Bridges in something serious after seeing him on Seinfeld and Airplane. He does very well playing a serious role and I enjoy the show.
4,"Basic English Revisited, Revisited?","I have the 1983 edition of this book. It was helpful during my high school days, and is still coming in handy today. I have noticed that some things are outdated (they have a quite humorous list of computer terms). I wonder if anyone will ""revisit"" this endeavor and publish an updated version."
3,expensive,Bought a pair of these for 12 dollars and they are selling for 27 dollars for one! Nice looking but rediculous price.
3,"Nice taste, good value",I have had others that are much better... but for the money its a good value..
5,great product and great price,You can spend over $13 at your local supermarket for something only 10 to 15 years old. This is $25 years old for under $10.
4,In the beginning there was....,"Manowars debut Battle Hymns is a very promising start. Even if it is not as well done as some of their later albums it is pretty damn' good.The power that Manowar is so famous for is there through the whole album. The album is somewhat uneven, but it does contain some very memorable and classic tunes like the title track, Dark Avenger and the stunning show-off bas solo Williams Tale by Joey DeMaio. Manowar has always been a band of incredible craftmanship, there is no doubt in my mind that DeMaio is one of the premier metal-bassplayers in the world, and Adams vocal is superb, almost equal to Bruce Dickinson of Iron Maiden.This album seemed to lay the plot for the rest of their albums. Most songs contain strong elements of war, battle and glory. For some people it is too much, and granted: Manowar IS over the top...but that is why we love them. Their no nonsense and attitude is undisputed."
3,More attitude than music,"The debut album by metal's loudest band, is simply more bark than bite, it sounds more to me like biker or ex con music than anything else. It shows is age from beginning to end, but is honest. Is incredible to consider that they have been around this long , almost 30 years! if you are a fan get it, if not pass it by."
5,The Birth of True Metal,"I remember when this first came out on vinyl. What a Great sound. The songs were very easy to like. DeMaio's writing is BRILLIANT!!! They have always released GREAT albums. ManOwaR is very true to their beliefs and have worked very hard, and it has certainly paid off. It is too bad that the United States does not recognize a true talented band that was born in the heart of upstate New York!Hail and Kill!"
4,May come to some fans as a shock,"Manowar, the band you either love or hate. I personally love Manowar and they are one of my most favorite bands. When I finally came around to buying Manowar's 1982 debut album Battle Hymns I had heard almost all of there latter albums. So initially Battle Hymns came as a shock to me. Not because its bad but because it was different. Though similar to their second album, Battle Hymns sounded very different from the Manowar I knew. Not near as fast, not nearly as well produced, and extremely dated sounding. Does it make it bad? Oh hell no. This is still Manowar all the way through, just at their young roughly produced best. Though they would go on to do better material, Battle Hymns still stands up to be a classic in their long catologue (This band is actually older than Metallica!). So if your a fan and haven't heard Battle Hymns yet, just don't expect Kings of Metal and you will end up loving it."
5,Ive seen this done LIVE,"let me say that the first time i heard this album it ripped right threw my chest, it was in 1984 at the height of metals reign. I got to witness the performance of MANOWAR many times at Lamour's in Brooklyn, New York, the rock capital of earth at the time. Let me say that this was one of the rare occasions that the live performance blew away the album , but the spirit that lives in that recording is once of strength and excellence, a must for any metal devotee, and a collectors piece with the orson wells narration...."
4,Manowar - 'Battle Hymms' (EMI),"Originally released in 1982 as this is the classic debut record from Manowar.This is the legit release,taken direct from the master tapes.Believe there used to be a piss-poor quality bootleg of this title in circulation several years back.It's easy to describe Manowar's music,L-O-U-D&HEAVY,I MEAN H-E-A-V-Y M-E-T-A-L!!You know,the kind that can get you evicted from your apartment if you play the record on '10' enough times.All eight tracks totally rip,but the best are the in-your-face opener ""Death Tone"",""Metal Daze"",the band's namesake ""Manowar"" and ""Dark Avenger"".Sort of dug the Orson Welles narration that goes along with the disc.For any 'newcomers' that may be reading this,'Battle Hymms' should appeal to fans of Bathory,Hammerfall,Slayer and maybe Testament."
2,"Well, what can be said about this band...?","THis band is just junk. Dressed like ""warriors"", arrogant and talentless, full of prejudice against everything.. BaTTLE>. is one of their worst albums ever."
2,library books,"i know that i bought a used book, but i wasn't happy because the copy that i got was from a public library complete with the reference number and all. i'm just disappointed!!!"
3,"The book is good, but........","I really do like this book but it is extremely biased. I am acompetitive gymnast, and yes, gymnastics does have its share ofparticipants who have their problems in the sport, but so does EVERY OTHER sport. Let's look at the wrestlers, or football players, or soccer players who nearly kill themselves trying to succeed. I know a few who do. Gymnastics is a tough sport, but so is every other sport, and if you can't stand the heat get out of the kitchen."
5,Right on the money.,"What else is there to say? This book said it all, and it said it truthfully. It's about time the world knew what many of us went through as child gymnasts."
1,Don't Read It!,"I totally HATED this book. All Joan Ryan talks about is how gymnasts and figure skating are abusive, bad sports. Well, I have NEVER been told in gymnastics to lose weight, or to keep focusing on winning. I love the sport, and Joan Ryan seems to be despising it. Also, Joan Ryan talks about the same things over and over again, AND HER MAIN FOCUS IS GYMNASTICS!. I don't reccommend it to any one involved in gymnastics or figure skaters. I agree with everyone who hates the book."
1,Don't be afraid,"This book fails to point out the great parts to these sports. The friendships, the 99.9% of coaches who are also your best friends, the thrill of performing, etc. I could go on and on. Don't be frightened by this book. I know of no fellow skaters who have had any of these ""nightmares"". They are very, very rare. Anyone who is thinking of getting themselves or a son, daughter, relative, involved in these sports should go for it. Had my mother not taken me to the skating rink 10 years ago at 5 years old, I would not have found the sport I love. The great points to these sports far outweigh the bad."
1,"Making of Figure Skaters, Breaking of Gymnasts","I am a 14 year old gymnast and i think this book is a horrible depiction of most gymnastics clubs around the country. Yes, in the early years of gymnastics, lossing weight and stunting growth was very common, but, come on now, we live in the 21st century! Look at such gymnasts Bogenskia and Korkina, they are 5'4 and 5'6 and still win competitions. And Kim Zemeskal is certinly not a little pixie and is still winning competitions to this day! And, it's a fact that gymnastics helps build bone density because of the pressure of tumbling. And, on one last note, Kerri Strug was NOT forced to do the final vault in the Olympics, she wanted to, for the team. Ask n e gymnast about the pro's and con's of the sport and they'll tell u the only bad part of the sport is being sore!"
2,About This Book,I was elite level in gymnastics and I never found any of my coaches the way Mrs Ryan describes them here. I actually know people who have the coaches mentioned in this book and as far as I know they haven't been hurt or injured by the coach. I dispise this book and she needed to talk to those who have the brighter side of gymnastics and ice skating both. Not all coaches in the sport are tyrants...even at Olympic level!
1,As a parent of a retired gymnast.... I have a different view,"My daughter particpated in the gymnastics sport for about 10 years and it was a great experience. She loves the sport and still maintains a great relationship with her ex-coaches (right, Cindy! ) They were and are her family, they saw her grow up and they coached her and loved her...and I will always be greatful for that! One day she decided to retire from the sport to try new things and it was NOT the last day that she went to the gym....AT was her home away from home...I think that Joan should have done a little more research before stating how horrible is for EVERYONE...it should have been a personal opinion and as many of us know... parents have a lot to say on the matter... I LOVE GYMNASTICS!"
4,Focus is on the worst that happens in gymnastics for a few %,"This book is good reading and opens one's eyes to the pressure in a sport for young girls. As a mother of an optional gymnast, I've read the book, as has my daughter, her teammates,coaches, and many mothers. Unfortunately, the author focuses on the worst situations in gymnastics. There are hundreds of young girls all over the U.S. participating in the USGF Jr. Olympic program at various levels who are not under the kinds of pressure discussed in the book. As a reader, one must keep in mind this is a story of a very small percentage of the athletes involved in the sport of gymnastics and figure skating"
5,"Provocative, truthfull, beautifully written.","A compelling story that exposes what is to often the truthof what goes on in elite level womens gymnastics and figureskating when the camara stops and the door shuts.Eatingdisorders, rampant injuries, and worse. Once you read thisyou will never look at gymnastics or figure skating again.I know I never will."
2,Gymnastics isn't that bad,"I am a serious gymnast and I read the book giving it a fair chance. I know how hard gymnasts have to push themselves and I know how hard our coaches have to push us. I love gymnastics and wouldn't dream of giving it up. The book was single-sided and need to put the positive aspects in too. She (the author) needed to put some success stories to balance it out. It is good to know that people care about us, but if we were really miserable, we would get out our selves. Gymnastics isn't all that bad."
2,"OK, but one-sided","This book is decent, but shows only one side of the story. Yes, the bodies of gymnasts and figure skaters are put under strain. But nobody is forcing them to do that! I feel that any young woman would have enough brains to quit a sport if they don't enjoy it."
1,BOO!,"I think that this is a horrible book!! When I read it, I was on a gymnastics team, and had no idea that it was a book bout how bad gymnastics and figure skating are. Thanks a lot Ryan."
1,This is a horribly unfair book,"Not all elite gymnasts are forced through child abuse! Christy Heinrich was just one gymnast! Heidi Geunther was just one ballet dancer! Anorexia isn't that prevalent! This book was really unfair, especially to those who compete in gymnastics and actually know what they are talking about, as I know. Gymnastics is a wonderful sport, and people should not always think of gymnasts as darling little girls abused unti, they get a gold, because its not like that."
5,What A Book!,"As a former gymnast and big fan of figure skating, I was drawn to this book. Although I read the book about 5 years ago when it was first published, I can still remember some of the chilling details that hit eerily close to my heart. A must for anyone who is considering high level sports for their children, or anyone who is slightly interested. The personal stories of horror make this a page-turner!"
3,"Interesting anecdotes, but a little repetitive.","I finally bought this book after hearing about it for years. My advice -- check it out from the library or borrow it from a friend. It's not a book that you will probably want to read again. The subject matter is very interesting and the author manages to get great quotes from some of the gymnasts, skaters, coaches and parents she interviewed. Ryan is adept at telling the stories in an almost made-for-TV style of writing. But the real problem with this book is that she repeats herself, over and over and over... using the same examples and sometimes even the same exact wording as she had in previous chapters. By the end of the book I had had enough. I also think this book would benefit from an updated reprint. It would be interesting to read Ryan's interpretation of Kerri Strug's performance at the Atlanta Olympics, when she completed her second vault on a seriously injured ankle."
3,Horror Stories,"I read this book when I started competing in gymnastics. Although I know many of the stories are true, many are also stretched from the truth. Not every elite level gymnastics/skater had those problems, but the book only focused on them. I don't regret reading the book, but don't let it make you see gymnastics as a cruel form of child abuse."
4,Fascinating look at the inner workings of gymnastics,"I've been a gymnastics fan for years but I was never aware of the conditions that produce our country's star gymnasts. The material covered by the book is very interesting.The author sometimes repeats herself (occasionally more than once) with facts and anecdotes, something a good editor should have caught. Also, if you're interested in figure skating, this book is not necessarily for you - the author's main focus is gymnastics.All in all, though, it is a very engrossing read."
3,Interesting...,"It was interesting to read. That is all I have to say about the book. I did not agree with the author, nor did I really believe her. The book seems to be almost biased against gymnasts, but some gymnasts, I believe, really do practice gymnastics because they enjoy it. And are not other sports just as dangerous as gymnastics? You see football players and hockey players getting hurt everyday! Everything has both advantages and disadvantages, and if you tried to nitpick your way through all of them, you'd never get to do anything else. While you're online reading this review, another insane hacker may be trying to stalk you. Those girls just happened to be the unfortunate ones, but just because they got hurt doesn't mean gymnastics is bad. And what does Ms. Ryan plan to do about it? Abolish gymnastics, like slavery?"
2,One-sided and written for shock value,"I participated in gymnastics drom the time I was 7 until I turned 16. I feel that this qualifies me to write about gymnastics much more than someone who has never trained or competed in this sport at all. Joan Ryan's interviews were interesting in their shock value, but the book was definitely one-sided. While there are some gymnasts who had traumatizing experiences, there are also some who have had terrific experiences. Interviews from BOTH sides of the spectrum are critical in order to get an accurate picture of the sport. The same can be said for coaches. Yes, some of them have very strict (even tyrannical) methods, there are plenty who are positive and supportive (such as the ones that I myself have worked with). In my opinion, Joan Ryan did not achieve her goal in producing this book: Instead of an unbiased, true look at gymnastics, she presented a very biased, sensationalistic piece. We don't want tabloids--we want the truth."
1,Exploitive,"As a young figure skater myself, I find this book quite exploitive. It puts a negative view on the training we go through. Try jumping a couple feet in the air when you are over weight. It doesn't work that way. And I for one (along with my skater friends), don't starve ourselves, we just eat healthy. My mom would KILL me if I didn't eat. Not all mom are like that; not all push their daughters to the brink of death (figureatively). If they are, they need to re-asess their values."
1,what a ridiculous and inaccurate book,"Joan Ryan's perceptions of women's gymnastics and figure skating are entirely untrue. She fails to mention the unending rewards from a sport that requires not only physical fitness but focus and determination. As with any sport, these have some problems. Not every athlete walks away happy, and there are injuries. However, Ryan chooses to highlight isolated incidents and claim that is all that results from these sports. She generalizes everything and in the end the book is more a work of fiction than fact. She herself has no true experience in the inner workings of the sport and gives and unfounded and unqualified judgement of the sports, which, in reality, have rewarded thousands of young girls in numerous ways."
1,HORRIBLE,"As a former Bela Karolyi protegee I have to say this is the worst book that I have ever read!!!! Joan Ryan has NO right to write a book about elite gymnasts when she has never been one herself. When I was w/ Karolyi it was never ANYTHING like what she says. What ya'll don't know is that Bela's smile and encouragment continue when the camera's not on him. I think that Ryan has a very sorry way of making a living!! I was an elite and I guarantee u that I and Dominique Moceanu, Kerri Strug, Kim Zmeskal, Jaycie Phelps, Shannon Miller etc... are in it 4 the fun. Bela, Mary Lee Tracy, Steve Nunno, The Rybacki's and every other coach who has an elite gymnast cares very much about there gymnasts. If they didn't they wouldn't have any elite gymnasts. Some people don't like Bela's coachig method and I respect that, so does he. But if u don't like his coaching just don't train w/ him!!"
1,The most biast book I have read on gymnastics,"I believe that Joan Ryan has no right to comment on elite gymnasts and figure skaters unless she, herself is invovled with elite sports herself. The way she disrespected Bela Karolyi was immature and disgraceful."
3,It is how gymnastics is,"I know that many gymnasts are anarexec, but that is just that happens in gymnastics.It is sad, but you must be thin and small to be a perfect gymnast, and they will just keep getting smaller, thinner and younger. I am twelve, but I have reached puberty, so I will never be the ideal gymnast.MAny gymnasts do not fit the mould of tiny thin and light. I mean when i was only ten, i was ideal, at four feet and six inches and probably 52pound sprite. But now I have grown to 4feet 10 inches and about 108 pounds, so I will never be able to be what i was when i was ten.It is sad that the womanly, graceful gymnasts are not considered good as the tiny, tumbling pixies. But that is just how gymnasyics. Soon, 8-11 year old gymnasts will be big names, like nz gymnast Lily West, junior New Zealand champion at age 9.Now, gymnastical girls are coming in as young as 9-10 years. They are tiny, maybe 36 pounds at 10! And they are thin and flat chested. Because that is the ideal gymnast."
1,..................,"This book is insanity and completely biased! I am currently 14 years old and have been involved in gymnastics since the age of 2. I have learned so many lessons and so many things about people and life itself from this sport. I am more coordinated in other sports now and I understand important morals such as hard work and setting goals. I weigh 130 pounds and am 5'5"". I eat regularly. My coach never once told me to lose weight. While a few gymnasts have had horrible experiences, Ryan attacks gymnastics/figure-skating alone when extreme pressure occurs in all sports, not just the minority of gymnasts that Ryan so biasedly overviews here. Gymnastics is the best thing that has ever happened to me."
4,Excellent,"A fine account of a most interesting and crucial series of Civil War battles. Stackpole treats everyone very fairly. Broad in its scope, audacious in its execution this book analyzes the Confederacy's third and final invasion of the North. A very excellent work that is well worth the time."
3,bUENOS,"Son buenos ahora pense que podian ser como los SAS, si esa son las espectativas no los compres , ahora como zapato comun no estan mal"
3,Not so convenient,"At first we loved the Bundle Me. We didn't have to dress our baby in big bulky snow suits or bury her in blankets. It was very convenient and snuggly warm for our baby. Then... she got sick. We had to wash the Bundle Me, and we followed the directions on the tag on how to wash it. But, after that, the zippers came off of it, one of the zippers even broke. Because we still loved the convenience of it, we took it to a seamstress who put on a new two-way zipper. Now, the other side's zipper has malfunctioned as well, so we just tuck that side under our baby and she still stays warm, but what a hassle! So, unfortunately, I would not recommend washing your Bundle Me in a washing machine."
2,Not safe for carseats,"I was initially excited to get this product at my shower. It seems perfect and the reviews are great. However, the hospital would not let us leave with it installed in our infant carseat. They said that it makes the carseat unsafe because it slides around too much. It is the hospital's policy to warn against Bundle Me's and similar products, so I returned mine. I suppose you could still use it on the stroller, but since I use the carseat that snaps onto the stroller, I would only be able to use the Bundle Me next winter and then only for a few months. For me, this product did not make sense."
4,A must for winter babies,"This made taking my winter babies out in the cold so easy. No need for a coat or heavy snowsuit. The only downside is it can be hard to get the straps right with the bundle me in (much the same problem you'd have with a snowsuit). I have found that if you cut a square out of the back it works a lot better. I know who wants to cut a brand new product, but it is so worth it."
1,Don't Buy This,As a car seat technician this product and others like it make me cringe! To use one of these is to risk your child's life in a collision. Nothing should ever go below your child in a car seat and nothing should ever touch the harness but the child. Use blankets OVER your child not under them.
5,Wonderful Winter Product,"This was one of my most favorite gifts! The bundle me is two seperate pieces one part stays in the car seat and the other zips up to it. If it is really cold out you can zip it all the way to keep your baby warm, when it starts to warm up you can either unzip the top or unzip the bottom to allow air in. Also, It has a little extra material on top so if is windy you can cover up your baby's face. A must have for winter babies!!!"
2,Be careful!,"I would be very careful when purchasing this! This product is made of very good material (heck, I'd like to be bundled in one myself!) it is soft, washable and looks great. The downside is that you should not be putting anything between the baby and the carseat because the carseat was not crash tested in such a manner. Additionally, we have a Britax infant seat and because of the additional head support used in that carseat, there is barely any room for my daughters head and she's only 8 weeks old! Sadly, we are returning this product and we're going to try one of the covers that only goes over the seat."
3,SAFETY CAUTION,These will keep your child warm BUT are NOT APPROVED for use with most car seats. You should not put anything between the baby and the seat. These are so padded that your child could be ejected from their car seat in a collision (caused by materials compressing -- same reasoning why children should never have a puffy winter coat on their child when they are strapped into the car seat. There is a way to modify this item -- cutting out the back piece -- to make it safely usable in car seats.
4,You need this if you live in a cold climate,"Our daughter was born in December, and I have to say that this was one of the most useful purchases we made! We used it in her infant car seat carrier, which made it easier to keep her warm without having to pile on a bunch of clothes. I've also used it as an insert to the MaClaren stroller, Quest. I'm already looking to buy the Toddler Urban Bundle Me for when she gets a little bigger."
3,Zipper wore out - prefer the Papooska,"We used a hand-me-down Bundle Me and it was convenient for our cold climate. However, I was disappointed when the zipper became disconnected on several occassions. Even though it had been gently used, I was hoping for better. The Bundle Me is a good idea and it was certainly convenient to not have to jam blankets around baby. On the other hand, it was a little inconvenient to remove when we would have one of those strangely warm winter days! In the end, I bought a Papooska and have been very happy. The Papooska snaps around any car seat, and we even used it when our baby was in the front pack, and we just started using it this Fall in the stroller. It's also alot easier to ""install"", so I'd recommend getting a Papooska instead..."
5,Great Product,"I LOVE this product. I have a Bundle me Lite as well and find them so GREAT!! I'm not sure about the review that stated they were too $$ and looked cheap!!! I've had so many compliments on mine, especially how nice they were. I would recommend these for your new bundle"
5,Absolutely indispensable,"Even though we live in a warmer climate, the Bundle Me was indispensable for keeping our infant safe from breezes or evening drops in temperature. I knew it would keep her the perfect temperature on a cooler day, and I could just put her in there in her onesie, instead of trying to guage layers of clothing. Plus when they're newborns, the stroller just seems to swallow them up- this surrounded her with cozy softness and made her fit better. I could also prop up the top flap a little to block low-lying sun from her face since the material above where the zipper ends is generous."
3,Good idea but makes my son sweaty,"The product is fine and holds up nicely, but it is not neccessary unless you plan on taking your baby for long walks in the extreme cold. I found that my son got REALLY hot in the BundleMe - as we ran errands and in and out of places. I prefer to use a couple of blankets and layer him so he doesn't get too cold or too hot. This item is not neccessary unless you live in Alaska."
5,great item,"This has been a terrific thing to have during the winter, even though it's not terribly cold here. The fleece is snuggly and much nicer than the fabric lining of the Graco infant car seat I have. I also think it provides some shock absorption for when the carrier is being used in the stroller."
2,Does not stay on my baby,"I bought this for my baby cause everyone else seems to own them in CO. I used a ""shower cap"" cover with my first but it was cumbersome so thought I'd ""upgrade"" with my second. The Bundle Me is a great idea and I liked that the cover zipped off and on easily as CO has crazy weather- 60 and sunny one day and cold and snowy the next. But my son is too wiggly for it. As soon as I zip it up on him he wiggles and pulls the cover down and has even managed to kick his feet out of it. I've tried tucking it in but it's too bulky to stay tucked in. In my opinion it's not worth the money and a blanket works better at keeping my son warm."
5,Carseat baby cover,Love this! Now I don't have to worry about a blanket that can fall off when walking into a store. It is so soft and warm inside for my baby. I just put a hat on my baby and not a snowsuit because she gets too hot. I keep the snowsuit with in the car for emergencies in case we were to stall in our vehicle and it were to get cold for a long period of time. (it gets cold where we live).
5,Awesome warm snuggle sack for your carseat/stroller!,I actually got one of these handed down after much use and it is still in wonderful shape. It is nice and soft and easy to throw in the washing machine. I have a 2 week old and it saves so much time so we don't have to bundle her up everytime we leave the house (she was born in late January in the mountains of NC.) It is easy to put on and I put an infant body support pillow on top of it in the carseat to support her head. Perfect!
4,Happy warm baby,"We have crazy winter weather here in Illinois so we wanted something warm for the baby. We really love the convenience of having the baby bundled up without having to worry about blankets blowing off and exposing her. Unlike the cheaper versions, this one is like a sleeping bag as opposed to just a cover. That helps keep her warm when it is really cold, but makes her sweaty if it is just chilly outside (she gets too warm). I do note that it is hard to adjust the carseat straps with this on the carseat."
3,"LIKE IT, BUT SLIGHT PROBLEM",We got this as a shower gift and loved it. There is a slit in the top that I can not figure out what it is used for. We have discovered that our daughter get's her head in that slit and it has worn a patch of her hair off in the back from it; Today she got her head wedged in this slit and it went over her head to her forehead and she was screaming while the nanny was driving.If someone came explain to me what this slit is for at the top of this and how we can eliminate this problem I would be thrilled. My e-mail address is mcap1996@sbcglobal.net
5,Great for cold weather!!,"We received the Bundle Me as a gift when our daughter was born. And I must say this is a great product. At first we were very skeptical that it would work better than a blanket, but this really does keep her much warmer. I actually wish they made this in grown up sizes :-) Highly recommend!!"
1,Does NOT pass car inspection,This is a great invention however it does not pass car inspection. Please be safe and do not use this or any other product that comes between your baby and the infant restraints. If you care about your baby use something that fits over the top of the car seat and not under the baby or under the straps..NOT SAFE! I had to return mine after inspection when it failed..I was just not willing to take the risk so I bought the Eddie Bauer cover.
1,Not safe for carseats,"American Academy of Pediatrics say they do not recommend using this because it has not been tested in the carseat in which it will be used, and it is considered an after-market product."
5,Original Bundle Me and Infant Head Rest,I have a question about the Original Bundle Me and hope that someone will be able to help me. I want to know how does the Bundle me work with the infant head rest? Does it just slip over the head rest? After reading all of these reviews I really think this would be a lifesaver and would like to buy it. Any help would very much apperciated. Thanks!
1,Unsafe for carseats,"My public health nurse, trained in carseat safety, told me that this product is totally unsafe for use in a carseat. I wound up using the bottom half on my bouncy seat, even though I've read that babies shouldn't sleep upon such thick material, I'll be darned to let my money go to waste and not use this thing at all!"
1,do not care for this model,"This item is both difficult to apply to a car seat and awful to clean. The fact that one would have to totally dissemble the car seat straps and headrest in order to apply this cover and then remove it for simple cleaning tells the tale. I would question the willingness of car seat manufacturers to continue to insure the safety of any infant in a seat that has been tampered with. In addition, the cushioning is too much for a small baby. The straps cannot be securely fastened.I really wanted a simple yet warm cover - obviously not this -- I will be returning this item."
2,The Fleece Comes Off,The fleece (polyester) that lines the inside comes off so easily. My little one had it all over her hands. I didn't want her to swallow it or inhale it so I sent it back. I use the Bundle Me Lite and that works great...no fuzzies that come off.
1,Returned it -- Safety Concerns,"We received this as a shower gift, but returned it. We'd already taken it off our registery after being told that our hospital (Mass General) will not allow you to leave the hospital with a BundleMe in the carseat (or any other carseat accessory, honestly). A well-meaning friend gave us one anyway, she couldn't believe we'd ""missed"" putting it on there.I can't see using something that my healthcare provider (and local police station) deems less-than-safe. You'll see a lot of one-star reviews due to this same issue ... and oddly, a lot of, ""Oh yeah, well, what do a bunch of nurses and safety ""experts"" know -- this has been crash tested!"" That's fine if that makes you feel better, but knowing that it's not recommended by the place I choose to bring my baby into this world ... yeah. That's good enough for me."
1,unsafe and bulky,"Our baby was born in December. We live in Colorado and wanted something to keep the wind and snow off her when outside. Thought Bundle Me was perfect solution.Looked cozy and convenient in pictures and in the store. Found it to be impractical and actually, unsafe. We have an Evenflo five-point restraint infant seat. The padding underneath was much too bulky casuing the harness straps to not fit properly. Tried and tried to get a good fit all to no avail. Returned this item and have since learned it is not recommended to have any bulky padding between child and car seat. Purchased a much more affordable car seat cover that just goes over the top. Works beautifully. Save your money and peace of mind. Don't buy this product."
1,Don't buy it!,"I just had a carseat safty technition come to my house to check the safty of my carseat and the first thing she did was take this carseat cover off! she said that in an accident, the fabric would squish down really thin and then the seat belt would no longer be tight on the baby. This is very dangerous. She recommended the fleece covers that only go over the TOP of the seat. She said nothing should be between the baby and the seat (except a fleece bunting and the carseat cover that the seat comes with). I live in interior Alaska so it's pretty darn cold here and my baby does fine with a thick fleece bunting with a warm blanket over after buckling the seat in."
3,Good for limited use,"The bundle me is a great product and worked very well in my son's infant carrier, only I found that when the temperature fluctuated it was a little to snuggly and my son would always swet. Also, it did not work well in the bigger car seat when he out grew his infant one and I found switching it from stroller to car seat was a huge feat. After, struggling for a while I found a different product called the papooska - made to be moved easily, and for different items I now prefer it over the Bundle me."
5,A necessary item for a new arrival!,"Purchased this for my sister's first child, was an amazing buy. It came in handy in so many places. Is super soft, children fall asleep as soon as they are placed inside. Has lasted for several years (and 2 children) now."
5,Chestnut,"This is a dog/child story with a different twist than the others I've seen in this category. Although children will enjoy it, so will adults. It is a funny, tender story!"
5,GREAT FAMILY MOVIE!!!,"OMG, what can I say?!This movie is soooo good. My daughter and I watched it together, laughed and cried together, and I got my husband to watch it and HE cried, too! It is such a heartwarming movie that is good for the whole family. I strongly recommend this movie to anyone, regardless of if you have children or not. It's the story of 2 orphaned girls who find a puppy. They end up getting adopted, but their new home has a ""No Dogs Allowed"" policy. What they end up doing to keep this puppy as their own is for you to watch--I will not spoil it. It is an extremely good movie that will pull at your heartstrings. WE LOVED IT!!!"
5,Great Movie. Great transaction.,"My daughter wanted this movie for a long time and it was so hard to find it, The seller sent it in short time and it was a great buying experience."
3,CUTENESS ALERT!,"CHESTNUT is one of those you-can't-help-but-like family movies featuring adorable kids and an equally adorable dog. To the film's credit, a positive spin is given to adoption and to adoptive parents, thus avoiding the usual cliches. The use of a Great Dane as the titular hero also allows a wider assortment of crises.Future Oscar nominee Abigail Breslin and Makenzie Vaga are charming and Justin Louis and Christina Tucci do nicely as the girls' new parents.CHESTNUT is certainly a good family film and one adults should be able to tolerate."
4,Interesting,"This is an interesting book that talks about the use of English language in British India. The way it was used for administrative purposes and also to suppress other Indian languages, for spreading christianity and other issues to keep the local population under the British control."
5,lots of bang for the buck,"I was not sure how good the tablets would work, but I have to say they work just fine. I tab a day vs. 3 capsules, more convenient and saves me money, too! They have a strong odor, but it's to be expected for the potency."
4,"This stuff tastes and smells GROSS, but it works!","I was using this because I had some bad depression going on. I was much happier and perkier and felt much more ""myself"" while taking it, but it smelled awful and tasted worse. It's also a pretty large pill, so don't buy it if you can't swallow a big pill.I found out a while after taking it that my problem wasn't depression or an imbalance of that sort, but I have hypothyroidism and my levels were well off. Get all your levels checked before assuming you have a problem that you may not have!"
1,Hated it.,Many songs sound as if they were recorded using a pan flute or cheap harp. I would stay away from this one.
4,HEAVY MAN DOWN!,"Now thats a gooda style, I have been searching high and low for genuine California underground street racing..........finally....this is it, and it is [great].........I have checked quite a few videos that claim street racing.....but they are not too gooda style.....................GOODA STYLE BADASTYLE THIS IS A GOOD A STYLE..............Heavy man down!"
1,Almost Unlistenable,"I love Gary Numan and I was excited that he was finally getting his albums released in the US again. In this respect he reminded me of Alex Chilton who had the world's ear, after the Replacements brought him new exposure, and he released ""High Priest"" whose low point was a cover of ""Volare"".Outland is noisy and tuneless and had no chance of reestablishing him in the US market. Great cover, though."
3,only fans,"but then it pays. soul protection rocks. well, not that much, outland a bit more. but it was the hidden tide of his sci-fi-voice. this cool sci-fi voice that reached on top on sacrifice. 90's soundtrack to only a movie that never was made."
5,I love this movie,"Hard to find, great movie so I had to buy it. I have no complaints. The price was good so I couldn't pass it up."
5,So Funny,"I had to have this, even thinking of certain scenes makes me laugh. No other zombie film is this entertaining in a humorous way. ""what's in the bags?""...........""rabid weasels"" or something to that effect, it's just so worth having on Blu-ray and dvd. Some scenes are kind of grainy like many HD transfers, but overall it's decent quality."
4,BRAAAAINS...,"Return of the Living Dead on blu ray is by no means a demo blu ray. In other words, the picture and audio quality isn't going to blow anyone away like Alien or Blade Runner on blu ray. However, the film was shot on a low budget so chances are the blu ray transfer is as good as its ever going to get. But even though it doesn't offer up an outstanding picture, it is still a significant upgrade from the dvd. It also has a lot of fun extras such as a documentary about the horror genre over the years. For those who've never seen the film at all and have recently gotten into zombie films and/or shows, this is a must get. It isn't serious and dramatic like the Walking Dead, or as action packed as the remake of Dawn of the Dead, but it is a fun, tongue in cheek, classic 80's horror film. And it also has a wicked soundtrack featuring the likes of 45 Grave, SSQ (Stacey Q's old band), TSOL, The Cramps, and the Damned."
4,"""Send more cops.""","Dude, these zombies ROCK! And they're SMART! Forget Romero's 'duh, duh' walking dead, these dudes are crafty! And funny? Fuggetaboutit! And gory? You betta believe it!"
5,I've been waiting a long time for this DVD!,...I always remember this movie growing up... this was always one of my favorite movies. They just don't make them like that anymore. To the dismay of many people I think!... So people buy this DVD!
2,Thanks once again MGM for NOTHING,"Ok 10 years AFTER we have DVD we STILL get another UN-remastered version of this awesome movie. NO 5.1 and the picture is still grainy. Just another ploy to get the fans to buy it again. The commentary by the cast was good until the zombies came in (I really DID want to shoot them in the head coz they were NOT funny in the least and were really annoying). Only the little mall chick that married the crew member (forgot her name) was entertaining with any insight into the movie at all, everyone else was too busy talking over each other and the zombies interupted some key points she was trying make. Besides the Dan O'Bannon commentary there is nothing new here."
3,Good.,I liked this flick. It was both funny and scary. But sometimes it conflicted itself on that level.
1,status of the dead,"Anyone interested in the current status of RETURN...DEAD should check out their cable stations. I'm not sure of the station, but I made a DVD hardcopy (not in HD of course) of the broadcast. It runs roughly 90 minutes and is absolutely complete, down to the music and dialogue, with all proper music credits at the end. It's HD, but the sort mentioned in the reviews of the Blu-Ray. Nothing to write home about, but comfortable enough to read the eye-chart in the office early on. It's the first time I noticed it, in fact. With all I've been reading, I'm not likely to buy a copy yet. Even my old laserdic was complete. Things are supposed to be getting better about music rights (though we know why we never saw Wiseguy's 'Dead Dog' arc on disc)"
4,Dead Can Dance,"""Return of the Living Dead"" is not meant to be taken seriously as a zombie movie. It is instead a rock and roll comedy that keeps the yuks coming while holding the bloody gore to a relative minimum. Some of the characters may be over-the-top cliches (especially the teenagers), but for the most part the actors do the Leslie Neilson-""The Naked Gun"" deadpan well enough to generate laughs. The movie's other strength is the design of the Dead themselves, which were based on real-life mummies and are actually quite chilling to look at. The plot is somewhat silly, of course, but at least it doesn't insult the intelligence. It should also be mention that ""ROTLD"" originated the famous ""Brains!"" chant of the zombies that would be so cleverly pariodied on ""The Simpsons.""This DVD edition also adds a quite informative ""making of"" presentation, with latter day interviews with the director and design team that created the movie, along with lots of other goodies for film enthusiasts."
3,I LIKE IT IT'S A STATEMENT!,"THIS MOVIE IS A ZOMBIE MOVIE LIKE ANY OTHER ITS FUNNY AND THE GORE IS OK. BUT SOME THINGS I WISH WERE BETTER LIKE THE ZOMBIES BEING SUPER STRONG, SMART, AND IMPERVIOUS TO SOME OTHER THINGS THE COOLEST GUYS WERE TRASH WHO DOES A NICE DANCE IN THE GRAVEYARD SHE IS SOOOOOO HOT! THE OTHER IS SUICIDE HES THE LEADER OF THE GANG AND ALSO ON THE BACK OF THE BOX HES A COOL GUY NO WONDER WHY TRASH WANTS HIM. IF YOU WANT A MOVIE TO WATCH WITH YOUR FRIENDS ON A FRIDAY NIGHT THIS IS THE MOVIE BUT IF YOU WANT A MORE SERIOUS MOVIE CHECK OUT DAWN OR DAY OF THE DEAD"
5,trash is a hottie...,"this movie is very much good. what more is there to say? you've got the crazy, brain-eatin' zombies, excessive violence, a very nice gothic/punk rock soundtrack (featuring TSOL, 45 Grave, The Cramps, The Flesheaters, and The Damned), and the best part: linnea quigley naked. now normally, she isn't that hot. however, in this movie she plays a very sexy punk girl. anywho, getting back to the movie, this is definetly the coolest horror movie ever. i've been watching it since 5th grade and i still love it. go buy it. now."
2,"Gory,well made, but plotless!Great for Halloween!","I watched this movie on a Halloween night. It's good to watch at that time, but other times it's pointless(The soundtrack was better). Good gore effects and this would remark scream queen Linnea Quigley's best performance as she plays a punk rocker named Trash, whom she later moved on to star in B and Z-grade films such as ""Sorrority Babes in the Slimeball Bowl-o-Rama"", ""Creepozoids"",""Night of the Demons"" etc. A good supporting cast that features Thom Matthews (""Friday the 13th Part 6: Jason Lives!"")Clu Gulager (""A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge"") James Karen and many more! A horror film of the 80's."
4,The Return of the Living Dead (Collector's Edition),"Great Fun, if you liked Zombieland, you'll love this one.I was looking for Funny, Smart, and a Little Gorey. and this film met all needs.You will laugh at dead as well as the living. There is a little nudity so be careful about viewing this around the little Zombies."
5,"""send more cops"" corpse to police radio mike","this is one of the funniest and goriest horror movies made in the 80's!!! this reworking of ""night of the living dead"" starts with the idea that the 1968 movie was ""based"" on a true story and that some of the ""dead"" zombies were sealed in drums and sent to be looked after. a few of the drums get miss shiped to bowling green,ky. and a medical suply werehouse! two bumbleing(stupid)workers open one and BAM,we have walking and TALKING zombies looking to feed on brains!!!the best part of the movies is thst the zombies don't follow the rules of the movie(""YOU MEAN THE MOVIE LIED!!!!!"") as the run ,talk and are quite smart. this is great fun if you let it be,give it a try!"
3,pretty good,"this is a good horror film,there is one thing is that when they die they remember who everbody is and they have the same personality.and in the romero films the zombies dont remember there before life.there is one part when a cut in have skeleton is saying brains make the pain of dying go away terrible scene.the innocent blonde haired girl who hangs out with the punks is a teribble actor.the zombie makeup is awesome."
3,"""If You Love Me You'll Let Me Eat Your Brains"" ~ A Zombie Love Story","What can you say about one of the most famous, off-the-wall, B-movie, horror cult classics of the 80's? Well..., for starters, the acting stinks, the obscene language is overdone and the overt nudity is unnecessary. Outside of that, it's also one of the funniest dark comedies within the horror genre ever produced! Not generally my cup of tea, but every once in a while when the moon is full and the acid rain is falling that appetite for brains takes over.WARNING: Not for the prudish or easily offended."
4,scary in a funny sorta way,I enjoyed watching this movie again. I haden't seen it since around 1990. I'm glad I ordered it.
5,The Return of the Living Dead (Collector's Edition,Normally a person would think of this movie a cheezy and corny but I remember watching this movie on tv when I was very small. I guess that is why I like this movie so much. Its nothing compared to todays standards but I watch it every week and still don't get tired of seeing it.
5,"THE GREATEST HORROR FLIC OF ALL TIME, WHO WANT TEST?","In the opening credits, it stats that the movie was based on a true story. Imagine that! The finest horror flic of all time!I've spent the last two years buying the original copies online. Because I thought they would never release it again. I even have the rare alternate ending w/ twelve minutes of never before seen material. Duriing the scene when the tyroxin turns into rain and begins to fall, it has the actual drawings that where used to make the film. Amazing! Anyway to make a long story short I'am absolutly exstatic that they are finally releasing this amazing film on DVD. I cant wait to see the special featuresIf anyone has doubts about this movie, believe me this movie is a must for anyone who enjoys movies.SHOCKING, GOREY, INTERESTING, SUSPENSFUL AND FUNNY......THE ULTIMATE HORROR MOVIE..."
4,sick funny,Return of the living dead may just be another dumb zombie movie to some people but not to the real horror freaks.
4,""" I hit the *&^%#*$ brain...you mean the movie lied ?""",One of the best lines from this movie.This has to be one of the funniest and best zombie movies out there. From great one liners (mainly by Zombies)...to good special effects. This movie should be re-released.The re-make of Night of the Living Dead is the only Zombie movie to top this one.
5,"""Got Brains?""","There are very few horror movies out there that will make you laugh, make you cringe, and make you think...can something like this happen? I first saw this movie when I was 14 and it scared the heck out of me...I loved it! It seems so real...thats whats so scary. Call me crazy..but we all know the goverenment hides things from all of us. Could they be hiding reanimated bodies? In this day and age you never know. Lets just hope not...if some decayed zombie started chasing me around chanting, ""Brains! Brains!!"" I would probably die laughing before he had the chance to nibble mine! A true classic and a member of my personal Top 10!"
1,The return of the disappointment,"Can't the companies who put out horror movies understand that majority of horror dorks are very sensitive about every little detail in their movies. So, why change the return of the living dead soundtrack and fix something that isn't broke."
1,Take your your Time and Do Not TRAVEL to the Wrong Merchant!,"This is one of my favorite horror/ comedy movies ,it starts when two employees unknowingly release a military chemical which reanimates the the who by the way eat brains(it makes the pain go away)! Anyway this is a fun movie with bizarre and cool music tracks. The copy i purchased was a obvious BOOTLEG COPY WITH POOR COLOR, SOUND, AND GRAINY EFFECT ,WITH OBVIOUS RECORDING LINES MOVING HOROZONTALLY THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE FILM,SO BEWARE AND DO NOT TRAVEL TO THE WRONG MERCHANT!!!!!!"
5,Best of the series,"Case\design- excellentvideo quality- good, but i expected a more cleaner image from grainsound quality**- superb, new 5.1 remix excellent use of full and clear surround soundextras- almost nothingthis is a fun movie that you can't let pass.**comment about sound is based on 5.1 because i don't have a dts system."
4,LOL,this movie made me laugh so hard. not really scary at all but funny. the zombies could talk and run
4,Brains!....Brains!.....,"A ghoulish good time in the form of gory zombie humor! Another fine achievement in the plethora of zombie flicks. I saw this filom years ago, and it is still one of my favorites. If you are a serious horror fan this one needs to be in your collection, or the collection simply isn't complete. The sequel, Return of the Living Dead II is also well worth checking out if you can find it. The third installment, well...they could have done a lot better. Four Stars!"
5,The best Zombie movie I have ever seen,"This movie excells above the rest for it's genre. I have been looking for this movie for quite some time before I realized it was out of production. The sheer mix of horror, realism, and mild comedy makes this movie have terrific replay value. The fact that it portrays what it would be like to start to die while you are still alive is mind-boggling. YOU MUST OWN THIS MOVIE!!!"
2,Bad acting and silly.,I love the Romero's series perhaps because I like the serious side of these movies. ROTLD starts fairly well but it goes downhill almost immediately. The acting is phony and the effects are not to the Romero's standards. The storyline is campy as well. OVERALL: MEDIOCRE.
2,Not for those who are true splatter lovers,"this movie is not very gory at all. as soon as someone is about to be eaten, the damn movie cuts to another scene, which personally pissed me off considering it was a zombie movie. the only gory scene is where the fat bald guy has his skull bitten open. if you are a true gorehound, this is not your type of movie. any return of the living dead movies are obvious and insulting rip offs of Romero's zombie movies."
2,"this was the worst zombie flick ive seen,","on the cover they dish it up to be scary and gory, wasnt scary, wasnt that gory, it was stupid, in this one of the living dead, the zombies can imitate voices and they are smart, that is so retarded. i wouldnt reccomend this to a hard core zombie flick lover"
1,A complete and total waste of film,This movie is worse than I remember it. If you want a good zombie movie watch something by George A. Romero.
1,soundtrack--movie,"soundtrackThe soundtrack is COOL and should be purchased immediatelymoviecant say enough bad things about it... imagine having sexual relations that are so uttewrly aweful, that you become a nun or a monk. this film will make you NEVER believe in Hollywood again.all violenceno plot(really! no. plot.)terrible cliched dialougeand it made me cry cos it was so BAD!I had to rate it, although thats being too kind."
1,Who are these people that like films like this?,"Wait, you know who you are. Romero salivating lemmings. There is no point dissenting towards a mass appeal of horror films based on zombies. (Sorry but nothing touches the first thirty minutes of 28 Days later) This was punk cinema C-movie everything. It's unnerving to think people make a living by working with these types of films.What a true disgrace to ever have my name associated with the making of a film like this, it would be an embarrassment to my craft and my profession to know my name was on the credits with something so cheesy and truly bathwater jugular deplorable."
5,Do you wanna party? 'Cause it's party time!,"This movie is the reason I always find out how close I am to a cemetery when we go somewhere. You never know when something like this could actually happen. Yeah, it's cheesy and has some less than stellar acting but man...I am still bothered by these zombies. The scene where the ambulance driver flips the lights on and there is a gaggle of zombies staring at him...man that haunts me to this day! PLEASE RELEASE THIS ON DVD!!!"
4,Once a Great Film,"I used to like this film as a kid and I still do - but when I watched it recently I realized that in the great Pantheon of Zombie films, Return of the Living Dead isn't a terribly impressive achievement. While the update was novel - it certainly wasn't any better than Romero's Day of the Dead. But unlike Day of the Dead, Return never takes itself seriously - its saving grace it seems. Not as funny as I once remember, almost ridiculously dated, and sadly - in need of a remake itself. Better than the sequels however, which should have never been made."
2,So So,"The first half hour of this movie is excellent. The homage to Night of the Living Dead, James Karen's hysterical perfomance, a couple of [disgusting] site gags. Then when all hell breaks loose it does downhill. The teens - - in horribly dated 80's garb -- exist merely as snack food for the zombies. None is distinguishable from the other - so who cares! Linnea Quigley has a quick turn as the teen [idol] and is the only one who brings any life to the proceedings when the kids are on screen. Not gory enough for real gore fans, the humor gets strained as the film goes on and there are very few chills. I guess if you ssaw it once when it came out, that will be as good as this one ever gets for you."
1,Still the Best Zombie Movie Since Dawn of the Dead,"Although filled with black humor and colorful performances, many reviewers have mistakenly labeled this film (Along with An American Werewolf in London) a ""horror comedy"". In fact, the horror here (note the R rating)is treated straight and scary. The humor is derived from wonderful comic performances from veteran character actors James Karen and Clu Gulager, who appear to be having a ball here. The result is the single best zombie movie--comic or straight--since George Romero's Dawn of the Dead. Full frontal female nudity and killer punk soundtrack only add to the enjoyment."
1,"""i just wanna party!""",i recently (finally) saw this movie and i really enjoyed it. my favorite type of horror movies are the ones with zombies and this movie pulls it off. i especially like the fact that it is uber 80's it was awsome
3,The Cut...,"I love this movie but they just edited one of the most beautiful scenes I ever seen, the walk of the Slime Zombie on the basement when he says his most famous line: ""...BBBBRRRRAAAAIIINNNNSS..."" and chase the girl... that walk is just marvellous, and is not complete in this edition... shame on you..."
5,A Zombie Comedy in a league of it's own,"The Return of the Living Dead is in a league of it's own it's quintessentially 80's with a lot of punk elements in it, and it is a ZOMBIE COMEDY WHAT? Yes a Zombie Comedy! It is a cult classic and it is very campy ( A great example of the fun and cheesy movies we have stashed away as a guilty pleasure.) Linnea Quigley is in it (the scream queen of all horror girls) and she plays the very sexy redhead Trash in the group of punks. The premise is zombies rise from the grave,and chaos and hilarity ensues. It will make you laugh and satisfy your love of horror movies. WHAT ARE YOU DOING READING THIS REVIEW STILL? BUY IT I KNOW YOU WANT TO. 10/10 (collectors edition well worth it too)"
5,Great Blu Ray transfer,I had this movie when it was on DVD. The studios did a great job of transferring to Blu Ray format.
4,Classic funny scary movie,"You can nearly anticipate everything happening in this movie, but its still a good one to see. The makeup and effects are no where near as good as they are today, but still this is one worth watching."
4,very good,"4 a used video this video played like it was new, i am very pleased with the video and i will order from this seller again."
5,A must have for children,My three year old son loves this DVD! This DVD is very informative and it breaks things down for young children to understand!
3,Okay but,"Normally I purchase the Ocean Prince Skinless & Boneless Sardines in Oil, 4.25 Ounce Tins (Pack of 24) sardines but since they have been on backorder for so long with Amazon and I was desperate for sardines so I ordered these. Well, they cost much more than the other sardines, you don't get as many in the tin, and (honestly), I don't care for the olive oil that they are packed in. I doubt I will purchase these again in the future as I think the 4.25 oz is a much better tasting sardine and, definately a much better buy."
5,The best canned sardines I've found,"They're not packed in all tight, the flavor is good, the can is pretty easy to open, and they do a consistently good job of de-boning and gutting the fish (my main complaint with most canned sardines is that they do a poor job when it comes to completely gutting the fish). I actually would prefer skin-on, so I've never really paid attention to whether they do a good job of this or not. Good stuff."
3,"Healthy, but a little bland and dry","I bought these Crown Prince Natural Skinless & Boneless Sardines in Pure Olive Oil because they came highly recommended as to purity, quality, low toxicity and taste. I am very health conscious and do not buy any fish that doesn't come from the coldest, most pristine waters in the world with the lowest levels of toxins possible. All these factors are supposedly true for this product; however, as healthy as these sardines may be, I found them a bit bland and dry for my taste. I will continue to buy them for the health value, but I am disappointed as to the taste and consistency."
5,Excellent quality and taste,"I just bought a case of these as well as a case of Crown Prince's cheap line of Sardines (known as Ocean Prince). The difference in quality is quite clear. These sardines have excellent taste, texture and aroma. The pure olive oil really makes a difference in the taste, and the sardines are thick and tender. The can is also easy to open. For the same amount of money, you can buy 12 of these or 24 of the Ocean Prince Sardines. Well, you get what you pay for, and it shows here. This is the first brand of Sardines didnt give me gas/bloated stomach after I ate it. Go for with the premium line...you pay more, but its well worth it."
3,boneless skinless sardines,They changed the supplier of this product a couple of purchases ago... they use to have 4 smaller sardines very very good now 3 larger sardines that are a bit dry... but still tasty...
4,Very Good,"Very good sardines.I learned that sardines are a much healthier fish than tuna, and that, unlike fishing for tuna, the fishing of sardines is not hazardous to their overall stocks or to other marine life. So, I'm switching to sardins.Only comment: I wish the can were easier to open."
2,tasteless,"I know these are are supposed to be good for you but I can't get over how tasteless these are...even with olive oil. I was expecting the ""pure flavor"" of sardines considering they're not laden with salt or other additives. But what a dissapointment...I think regular tuna in water tastes better. I give it 2 stars only because they're a healthy alternative for those watching their salt-intake. Other than that, these sardines lack flavor and taste and I definitely won't be buying them again."
2,Excellent Sardines - Poor Fulfillment by Supplier/Amazon,"The sardines are excellent in every way. Delivery is unreliable.Crown Prince Natural Skinless & Boneless Sardines in Pure Olive Oil, 3.75-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)I had signed up for Subscribe & Save for this product - one case (12 count) every 3 months. The initial shipment went without a hitch.When the time came for my second shipment, I was notified by email that ""This item is not currently eligible for Subscribe & Save."" No other information was offered, and Customer Service was unable to explain the problem or offer any solution.I expect that if Amazon and the manufacturer offer a product, that they would fulfill the agreement, or at the very least offer an alternative."
1,Poor Quality,"[[ASIN:I purchase these probably 1 year ago. I was very disappointed with the quality. I was unable to eat these sardines. They had scales and hard bones along with a tough texture. Sorry product. I'm giving them to the cats.B000EEWZF0 Crown Prince Natural Skinless & Boneless Sardines in Pure Olive Oil, 3.75-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)]]"
2,Quite Inferior ---,"The MOST moist, delicious, & sustainably caught sardines are, by and far, the Wild Planet Brand!I tried both the ""Season"" and ""Crown Prince"" brands and the difference in flavor and quality was light years away from the Wild Planet brand.I live in New England and can only find WILD PLANET brand in my local Stop and Shop.It's amazing that we have 3 ""Whole Foods"" Markets in my state and not one carries the Wild Planet brand! They are only carry what I believe to be the inferior quality brands that I mentioned.I'm sure that the Hoffman and Manischewitz families that own Crown Prince and Season brands wouldn't mind having the Wild Planet brand alongside their own, since they feel theirs are such great quality, right?Who knows, they just might learn something about having high standards from the lovely bunch of people that own Wild Planet in California.To top it off, all Wild Planet products are in BPA free cans...what more can you ask for?"
1,The multiple positive reviews here are baffling!!!,"Let me preface this by saying I've never tried sardines of any kind before. In addition, I'm not a food snob by no means, and I can enjoy protein shakes and meal replacement bars if they are of high quality. I LOVE Wild Planet canned tuna and after reading reviews on here comparing it to these sardines, I thought to myself, ""maybe I'll like these after all."" Just ONE bite is all it took - I almost gagged and QUICKLY spit it out of my mouth. I also hurriedly rinsed out my mouth because the taste was nauseating! Unless you actually enjoy sardines and regularly consume them, do yourself a favor and PLEASE don't buy these!"
2,These Taste Like Chemicals/Metals,"I'm not sure why these get such high ratings, except maybe that they're skinless and boneless. I think they taste pretty strongly of pollutants and thus wonder about the condition of the places in Morocco where they are obtained. Crown Prince Naturals' kipper snacks also tasted like chemicals to me when I tried them.Wild Planet's sardines (from California) have skin and bones, but they taste much cleaner to me. And Bela sardines (if you can get them) are even cleaner. I've also heard good things about Cole's and so am hoping to try those."
4,"Not the Best, but not the worst","There are some really good thing about this disc, although it's not the best (It's not the worst either). One is the cover of the case (and the face of the disc itself)! Two is the outtakes on this disc. They're actually funny. Three, the seiyuu interviews! The Jan-Ken (Rock,scissors, paper) game is hilarious!Also, the opening and ending themes are different from the first 15 episodes, the characters get a wardrobe change (which means no more of Aya's orange shirt), and Schwarz gets more airtime. All in all, pretty cool stuff. ^^"
2,Outdated style,"I don't know if this is the same performance as on the Klemperer recording of the complete Beethoven symphonies from Amazon, but I think it is. I found most of the later symphonies as recorded by Klemperer a big disappointment. Ponderous, heavy and slow, I found none of the esprit that is also necessary to bring off these special works. The 9th is almost unlistenable, it is so pompous. Surely there is a difference between this and grand. These were recordings made late in Klemperer's life and I'm afraid they lack the necessary energy and eye for detail."
1,Just can't get into this one ...................,"This album is way too emotionally cool for my liking, although I know it will hit the spot for some people, because the playing is first rate. Before getting this, try the melodic warmth of his great 2004 album ""Inside Out""."
3,Lifeless Birds,"Nicely framed and packaged, but print is fuzzy. This company's printing is often distorted, and that may be part of the problem, since the quality does not match the picture. T.C. Chiu does a lot of popular art, and most of it is well colored and highly detailed. While Peacocks has an ethereal quality due to color use and delicate floral sprays which appear almost iridescent,the peacocks themselves seem unfinished."
3,Not Widescreen as listed,"This is a really good movie, but that is not what this review is about. In the product description the movie is listed as being widescreen 1.85:1. This is not the case, the movie is presented in full screen 1.33:1. Also, the listing describes the studio that released the DVD as Gaiam Entertainment but this is a different pressing by Echo Bridge Entertainment. I have had bad experiences with Echo Bridge in the past due to their lack of quality control. Had the listing been correct I may not have purchased the disc. Beware. Somebody at Amazon needs to change the listing."
5,Amazing Work From a Legend,"I find it truly amazing to hear these songs played on acoustic guitar. It is really interesting to me to compare the way Pete sings it on the original take versus how Roger would sing it on the master that everyone knows. I love hearing demos of any band, but particularly of The Who. To hear ""Substitute"" without Keith Moon roaring in the background. Or to hear ""You Better You Bet"" with lyrics missing. It's thrilling for any Who fan.Every band seems to have, at some point in their career, put together a collection of unreleased work. The Beatles had their 3 Anthology sets, The Rolling Stones released multiple collections, and now you can have the newly rereleased Scoop albums, full of fascinating material by Pete Townshend. I'm only sorry we can't hear more."
5,More Great Who Demos,"I loved the Who demos on the first Scoop, so went browsing on eBay to find this, the second volume. I got it on vinyl and love it just as much as the first one. The demos on this collection are very interesting. ""You Better You Bet,"" the opening track, has some of the lyrics missing. Pete's vocal impressions on ""Pinball Wizard"" are entirely different from the way Roger sang it on ""Tommy."" All in all, this album is very interesting to a Who fan, and is very entertaining as well."
4,"Older title, but still a lot of fun","This is an older title and may not run on all systems. But, it is really entertaining for my 3 yr old. Definitely meets the criteria of ""learning"" + ""game""."
4,My Heart Skips A Beat Back To The 80's!,"Great CD with lots of favorites. These songs take me back to my high school days. I have some of these songs in extended form on old tapes and their getting worn out. I do agree with one recent review that the song ""Wishing On A Star"" should have been the original. They could have added that remix as a bonus track.My favorite tracks are: ""Show Me"", ""Because Of You"", ""Promise Me"", ""We Can't Go Wrong"", ""Inside Outside"", & ""My Heart Skips A Beat"".If your into 80's/dance music, you can't beat this collection.I also suggest getting Expose Greatest Hits."
5,Dancin' Divaz,"I grew up listening to the Cover Girls in the 80's. It was my dance music when I was a teenager. They were the ""Destiny's Child"" of the 80's, only The Cover Girls were the orignators, Beyonce should kiss the ground they walk on. The greatest hits has all the good songs on it, but for some reason, they left off one of The Cover girls best songs ""Spring Love"". This is a good dance music collection, it's not ""freestyle"" like some reviewers keep refering too. The new generation thinks they can coin terms and label old school music whatever they want. This type of music was never called ""freestyle"", there is no such music and it's not up to people who weren't even born when this music came out, to label it that. The Cover Girls are ""dance music"", ever hear of DANCE music?"
1,Coughing during Träumerei,Members of the audience can be heard coughing in the background during several tracks including (and especially) Träumerei... enough said.
3,If you know Jon...,"If your familiar with the out of this world Jon Anderson and his accompanying far-out lyrics and instrumentation, then this is classic JA. Lacks Yes' harder moments, but it is after all a solo album made around the Going for the One period, where Jon plays many of the instruments and tells the sci-fi-esque tale of...? Not sure, but it doesn't really matter. If you like JA, you'll like this album. Lots of synth and harp and layered vocals. Great artwork as well."
5,Still fresh after all the years...,"This album is on my ""desert island"" list. A must if you're exploring Yes music. He weaves a tale and song so well, it seems that he's discovered new chords along the way.If the music fits you it will be with you forever. If not, you won't care for it."
5,A quasi-mystical dream,"Moody, mystical, romantic, innocent, ominous. And that's only the first track!!! More akin to his albums with Vangelis rather than YES. It's like a soundtrack to a fairy tale, to be sure.In the Jon Anderson pantheon of works, this would be his ""Lord Of the Rings"". This first solo effort established him as an artist in his own right.According to Anderson, it took some six months to make with an occasional lapse of sanity but considers it one of his proudest achievements.I agree.Thank you Jon for persevering."
5,"This is a ""Short Stories"" review since there isn't one","After all that's been said above about this heroic album, ""Olias,"" it would be silly to go on. Since I haven't found the first Jon & Vangelis album, ""Short Stories,"" on Amazon, I thought I'd give it a go. At the time, knowing that Yes had disbanded yet again but in a way that signalled a true breakdown of the 70's musical vision, I was a desperate man. ""Short Stories"" should be made available by Amazon because it is the LAST Yes-vision album to be written. Vangelis rises to the occasion orchestrally and rythmically while Jon delivers the cleverest melodies. I only wrote this to tell you it's one of the last jems from the Yes-related folks at their best. That's all."
5,An Amazing Spiritual Experience,"I bought this on vinyl, first, many moons ago. I played it alot then, wore out that vinyl but still played it and now can play repeatedly and clearly on CD.This disk is absolutely stunning and is certainly a desert island disk. I am absolutely familiar with every second of this album and yet I remain constantly drawn to it. The majestic vocalizations and orchestrations are intensely spiritual. The open-minded, attentive listener will be transported.I have always held that what was called ""Progressive"" rock (a horrible moniker for a style of music...although maybe a tad better than ""Alternative"") was in reality one of the first ""World Musics"". This album supports that argument, with a wide array of exotic percussive and melodic instruments and the texturing of sound by use of trancelike, repetitive rhythms and vocal patterns. This is many years before Peter Gabriel or Paul Simon popularized World Music.This disk is essential."
4,Solo debut,"Originally released 1976 on Atlantic. I have the LP. Very new age. It is a concept album with a fairy tale storyline with a wizard and the flying ship from the cover of Yes' 1971-72 LP ""Fragile"". Some of the songs are in a language either Jon Anderson made up himself (he has been said to have done that), or an ancient tongue a la Middle Earth (look for his new solo album). It sounds like Greek pre-Yanni electronic music pioneer Vangelis is on here, but he's only listed in the thank yous (they started collaborating in 1975 with ""So Long Ago, So Clear""). Recently only available as an EU import (if you buy it new, of course), and reissued in North America on CD officially by Wounded Bird, though I have a Japanese import."
3,Meditative music at its best,"This album is a musical journey with Jon, the instruments sometimes sound like as Vangelis'. If U like him, U'll like this CD. Or if U like meditative, mainly instrumental music, then this CD is 4 U 2. I gave Olias only a 3 not because it's a bad album, I just want 2 show with this grade that he did prettier albums after, including the No.1. master-piece Song of Seven CD. I gave it only a few listens, but I have 2 get used 2 it... and I think I'll like it!"
2,"""Olias Of [what again?]""","Love Jon's spacey demeanor, I love to ""hippie-out"" with him but I can't seem to be patient enough with this one. I'll get there but I enjoy his work with Kitaro more. This opinion though is from a guy who has never heard any of his work with Vangelis...so, you know."
2,Save Your Money,"I purchased this album based on the glowing reviews at Amazon.com but I am very disappointed. This album is musically weak; it is no match for the combined musical genius of the former members of Yes. Save your money on this one and spend it instead on Relayer by Yes if you don't already have it. In my opinion, Relayer is the most musically complex album ever produced by Yes and represents the pinnacle of their work."
1,one star after one listen,"I bought Olias of Sunhillow after being a huge YES fan for years including Jon Anderson's better solos: Change We Must, Deseo, Song of Seven, and Animation. I actually thought this was a new CD in 1994, so while in Japan I shelled out $25 for it. I taped it, listened once in my walkman ...and threw the CD into the trash. Seriously, it is sitting in a landfill in Japan.Well, at least I had my tape. A few months later, I listened again and found some parts that grabbed me. A couple of more listens, and I realized I threw away a great CD.For obvious reasons,--Anonymous"
1,Near-Music that Yes Members must have said no to.,"Unmitigated garbage. Schoolyard chanting, simplistic melodies, vocals which show emotion when the music doesn't call for it. If this is what you are looking for in music, then this is your disc. By the way, I would rate all Yes albums in this period 5 stars. In addition, Chris Squire's solo effort rates a five. This might be the worst album I have ever heard. Thus, I am a Yes fan and a fan of Jon's. However, this disc is unlistenable."
4,"Etheral,beautiful and soothing without being boring.","It is easy to understand where the bright, melodious nature of Yes' music originated. Jon Anderson gave us a full glimps of his musical vision and prowess with ""Sunhillow"", without the aid of his technically brilliant counterparts. A beautiful work of art that would never trully be equalled by Anderson's later works. Not only can his music be out-of-this-world and innovative but also quite soulful in it's own way. Quaranteed to entertain and lower your blood pressure. Thank God for reissues!"
5,A Prog Masterpiece!,"If you have followed Yes throught the years, you are aware of the abstract images that Jon Anderson conjures up with his lyrical genius. This LP is way over the top! He manages to tell a story here, and still stay true to his ""mystical"" style of writing. This album is not just good Progressive music, it's a celebration of what Progressive music is all about. Moving, and awe inspiring. Nobody paints a mental picture like Jon. The fact that this gem has made it to CD after all these years is incouraging. In a day when music is all about pain, rage and anger, this LP brings back memories of a time when music was artisic, and uplifting...not primal therapy for the socially disturbed. Like other works of it's kind, this was music for the mind, written from the heart. I said the same thing about Chris Squire's ""Fish Out OF Water"". They do not make music like this anymore. Buy it now before it dissapears completely."
5,A Masterpiece!,"I've loved this album since it came out in 1976. This is an incredible piece of music with majestic vocalizations (11 or 12 tracks at once?), moving polyrythms, and just enough mystique to put your imagination out beyond the limits of this world. I have often wished that Anderson would make a full length animated motion picture using Olias of Sunhillow as the sound track. The story is certainly substantive enough. My understanding is that he recorded most of this locked away in his garage. I have listened to Yes and Anderson since 1974 and I enjoy most everything he has cranked out apart from Yes, but understand Olias of Sunhillow is not typical Jon Anderson music. This is a must have for anyone who enjoys Anderson's superb talent. Get it and you will be flooded with images of ""solar"" dancing and playing a silence nobody knows."
5,amazing model,this is the first time i have ever done a battleship model and it was so much fun to put it together the detail is great and it is easy to add on to it without much trouble
4,Battleship Yamato,"Great model and pride of the IJN. Must read and study the entire manual several times BEFORE startinig to paint or assemble. Should re-consider the building sequence based on size of parts and installation. Must be very, very careful removing and building the antenna due to the fragility of the pieces. The four airplanes stand out becaues they are painted green and care must be taken when putting them together,painting and applying decals. This is my fourth Tamiya 1/350 Battleship model and I found out these kits will be very scarce and consequently the price will increase dramatically. Tamiya paint is also have to find."
1,Caution : Extremely racist,"When I started this novel, I found it more enjoyable than the other two Ethel May Dell novels I had read (The way of an Eagle and The Lamp on the Desert). Sylvia, the heroin, has a refreshing take-charge attitude and will not submit to the will of her father, her step-mother or her husband.However, the many racists comments of the author quickly turned me off. Unlike in The Lamp on the Desert, where some indian servants are described in a positive view, the Kaffir (as Mrs Dell calls them) are all written as lazy, monkey-like, rolling their eyes, their speech barely human etc. I found it really offensive and for that reason, would not recommend this novel."
3,Review for Top of the World,"This book ended very predictably. No surprises there. I enjoyed it mainly because it was about South Africa, and I am always interested in stories about Africa. The descriptions of the area were fairly well done, but the characters were very one-dimensional, not realistic at all as far as their behavior and reactions went. I would have enjoyed it more if the character of the villain (who must have been some kind of hypnotist, the way he was able to bend people to his will and get them hooked on drugs) would have been developed more. You really had to read between the lines as to what his power over people was. Evidently everyone was very weak-willed and weak-minded to allow him to drag them down the way he did. The heroine was very preachy, self-suffering and goody two-shoes. Not impressed with her at all. All in all, not a BAD book, but certainly not great in any way."
5,good christian music,"this is a very good cd with great songs like ""love me more"",""sun-stars-moon"" and ""the killing tree"" the only song i don't really like is ""fill my cup"" and that's about it,a very good debut cd by paul colman trio, can't wait until there next cd comes out."
2,So-So,"I just received this CD from a friend for my birthday. I did happen to catch PC3 during the Third Day tour and I could barely understand any of their words so I was very unimpressed with them in concert. The album is better because I can read through the lyrics in the insert, however, I still don't find this album to be much of a breakthrough as far as a fresh sound. I'm not saying the album is horrible, but I don't think its anything special either. I don't think this will be an album that I listen to regularly like Jars of Clay or Third Day. A average album at best..."
2,run of the mill material,vocally whitney sounds soulful on this disc.but as is the case with her music it is so wack.aside from her first album the others are aside from a few songs here and there pretty weak.her greatest hits sould put everything into perspective.this disc sounds like everything else out there.the l-boogie cut is tight i was made to love him and it's not right but okay is alright but the album is to formulated for me.
2,she's in a better place,nevber did like this song when she was living and yes living proof that drugs do kill and yes we were all wearned about the dangers of drug use cocaine is a mutha.
3,Alright...,"To the person who wrote that Whitney was trying to copy Mariah by going into R&B, I don't friggin' think so. Whitney is already R&B, Mariah had to flash her butt to Puffy, ODB, and all the rest of them to make her music wannabe R&B. I admit that this album was not Whitney's best, but Butterfly (the wannabe R&B album) SUCKED!"
2,He we go again,"Whitney, Lets give it up. The only songs that are even readilly able t listen to are ""when You belive"" which she is out sung by Mariah, And ""Heart Break Hotel"" which she is outsung by Kelly Price. It's over Whitney . It has been for a while."
3,My girl Whitney can do better.....,"If you're expecting a lot of soul...It's not here. The Wyclef-penned title track is the bomb but the rest lacks. ""Heartbreak Hotel"" has its moments. Otherwise, just wait for the singles. Peace."
2,"One, maybe two songs that I enjoy","My love is your love is a great song. Other than that, the CD doesn't have much to offer. It's the only song I play on the CD. I'd probably play the duet with Mariah Carey more but I hear it on the radio anyway."
2,Two stars for only two good songs.,"When I heard Whitney had a new CD out, I was excited, especially after I heard ""Heartbreak Hotel"". After hearing the first two songs, I was pretty sure that I had gotten my money's worth. Boy, was I fooled. A massive disappointment. I wasted thirteen dollars. Her best CD's were her first two. I wish I knew what happened, Whitney can do better than that. Who knows maybe it has something to do with her husband, one bad choice after another!"
1,"Weak, not very good Whitney","The only two noteworthy songs on this cd are the duet with Mariah Carey and I was made to love Him produced by Lauren Hill. It seems that Whitney needs to listen to those more ""humble"" songs of her yesteryear. She's trying to be ""hip'-hop"" when her voice is a lagacy R&B status. Try again Whitney."
2,Disappointing for a long overdue CD. Should be much better.,This CD will take time to really grasp. The musical arrangements were really disappointing. Whitney can be and must be better.
1,Low QUALITY,"She is trying soo hard to stay competative in a world a faith, k.price, maya, and that girl from Fresh Prince.Not worth buying, but she comes from the brick city, and she is proud of it so I like her on that note."
3,not whitneys best,"i think whitney could have gave more into this album, however, i do think it was good but i wouldnt listen to it 24/7. the duet with mariah is wonderful and is probably the best song on there or ""its not right but its ok"" i really think whitney should go back to her old music she's trying to hard to get more into R&B. now mariah can do R&B but whitney sorry i liked your older music better. although i do recommend buying this cd if you are a fan."
3,Houston soars as soul-drenched CD hits the spot!,"There are some good and bad points to this album. First the good points. Whitney sounds pretty good vocally on this album. She sings from the heart and her voice has much more depth and darkness than it did before. I love #1,2,3,4,5,7,8,and 12. The other items are not worthy of Whitney's voice but she still sings the hell out of them. We have to remember that people change and it befitted Whitney to offer songs to please her old fans as well as attract new ones. Overall, a pretty good CD!"
2,THE WORST WHITNEY HOUSTON ALBUM EVER,"I HAVE BEEN A WHITNEY HOUSTON FAN SINCE HER FIRST ALBUM AND I CAN TRULY SAY THAT THIS IS THE WORST ALBUMS I HAVE EVER HEARD HER RECORD, IN FACT IT IS ALSO THE FIRST CD THAT I TOOK OUT WITH THE GARBAGE. MS.HOUSTON SHOULD STAY WITH THE WONDERFUL BALLADS THAT SHE GIVES HER HEART AND SOUL TOO.I WAS TRULY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS ALBUM AND WOULD NOT RECOMMED IT TO ANYONE."
3,The Difference...,"I dislike the vast majority of Whitney Houston's music as much as the next guy, but this cd actually has some decent songs. ""It's Not Right..."", ""Heartbreak Hotel"", and ""If I Told You That"" are a welcomed change for Whitney. While I can't recommend buying this cd (there are more bad songs then good songs on this disc) I will say this much...if you ABSOLUTELY must own one of her cds this is the only one worth your time."
4,Amazing!,"This album is Whitney as Whitney! She is amazing, her voice is the best, the songs are great..... I got this last Christmas and it was a great album that was totally uplifting."
3,IMAGINATIVE,"This has to be one of Whitney Houston's better works. In this album Whitney steps away from her tradition melodies and brings it back to her club and R&B roots. With jammin' songs such as ""If I Told You That"", ""My Love Is Your Love"", and ""It's Not Right But Its Ok' Whitney has proven her durability against the test of time."
3,Whitney could have done better,"I am a HUGE fan of Whitney's but I was actually disappointed by her output in this album. Usually, I listen to each song on each of her previous albums, but I actually find myself pressing the ""skip"" button on my CD player for some songs. While Whitney used to be one of my role models, I am disappointed again that she has now seemed to lose her sense of identity by trying to push into the mainstream with some of her songs, using ""exclusive stars"" like Missy and Lauryn to push her through. Whitney has always been distinctive and has an incredible voice, but this album was a disappointment. The only true good songs are 1,2,4,5,7,8,10,11. Otherwise, if you are a true fan of Whitney or just want to hear something new, buy this album."
3,Hmmm...,"This album had some very good songs and some songs that were simply horrible (as is the case with most CDs) The last songs are rather boring, only the first couple of songs are worth listening to. I was expecting much better stuff from Whitney, but then she didn't write any of the songs."
3,I Want Back The Old Whitney Houston!!!,"I Give this CD 3 stars for 3 good songs! Whitney, honey, Hip Hop is not for you. Please stick to R&B, it suits you much better and it sounds a lot better too. I have been a Whitney Houston fan since the first album came out, and this seems to be the worst yet! Her vocal skills are not used on this CD, she has too many fast songs. As for the song with Mariah Carey, I enjoyed Mariah's part better, but I think Whitney's voice is prettier. Too bad we didn't get to hear much of it this time!"
5,Whitney's still got it!,"This CD is one of the few that I can listen to the whole album and not get annoyed with the songs. I found that it had a unique style, and is different compared to her previous recordings. I feel she did an outstanding job creating a mood/feeling within each song-- and as a listener I feel that is what makes music-music, the emotion put into it. Whitney still has the grove!"
4,I missed Whitney...,"I enjoyed this new album of Whitney's. It seemed like everyone she collaborated with felt the problems going on between she and Bobby. Many of the songs did show Whitney was going for a different style...maybe one that is similar to her younger counterpoints. This is ok, just as long as she stays herself...and doesn't turn into some others...(not mentioning any names). Overall I liked it, I love the song produced by Wyclef ""My Love is your Love"" I can definitely feel that one."
5,"""A Lost Gem""","""My Love Is Your Love"" became Whitney Houston's first studio album since her 1990's ""I'm Your Baby Tonight"". Although it only went as high as #13 on the Billboard Pop Album Charts it still managed to produce 3 hits for Whitney: ""Heartbreak Hotel"", ""When You Believe"" (a duet with Mariah Carey) and ""It's Not Right but It's Okay"", all Top 5 songs. The title song became one of Whitney's biggest songs globally selling over 3 million copies. In the U.S. the record has gone 4X Platinum. Whitney would also win another Grammy for Best R&B; Vocal Performance for ""It's Not Right but It's Okay"".There was also a CD release of various songs from this album that were dance mix versions that became extremely popular in dance clubs around the world. The remix version of ""It's Not Right but It's Okay"" went to #1 on the Dance Charts."
5,Great Album!,Whitney Houston does it again!!! This album is amazing and this album is way diffirent then her past albums. Not really any slow love songs but it's ok! This album oddly peaked at #13 on the charts but was certified 4x platinum in the US alone and sold over 13 million worldwide.Heartbreak Hotel #2It's Not Right But It's Ok #4My Love Is Your Love #4I Learned From The Best #28My favorite track on the album is no other than Heartbreak Hotel. The song is just a great track and I remember when it was outplayed on the radio. Now I wish Whitney would come up with something like this. Make sure you pick up a copy of this album!
3,"Houston's new album has great tracks, but not breakthrough.","Huoston's new album has great tracks, but the 'I Will Always Love You' voice can be heard seldom on this album. The voice is mostly too melow. 'When you Beleive' was also a disapointment for me, Mariah and whitney didn't have that super voice they usualy have in their songs. All in all, the album is good, but it didn't reach my expectations."
1,"Disappointing, not Whitney at all!!!","The only noteworthy song on this album is the duet with Mariah Carey. Whitney Houston usually does well. But this time, she missed the mark and missed it by a mile. She was singing songs that were not Whitney. She didn't have that ""hungry"", spirited sound like she once had. She should try again, but this time, use her talent or maybe listen to her previous cd's and see what is missing. She should leave people like Missy Elloit out of her music. Missy is good for ""ghetto"" and ""urban"" sounds, but she dosen't mix with a true diva. So for both Arista and Whitney, back to the drawing board.....Please!!!"
2,Whitney Fans Save Your Money!!,"For all of you who were waiting for Whitney to release an album of sure-fire songs that would definitely move you to evoke some sort of emotions, this is not the one. It would seem that Whitney has jumped on the bandwagon,and opting to follow a musical formula that is adapted for the younger up-and-coming singers of today, put out a very substandard product. I love Whitney to death, but I am appalled that she would allow this album to even come out, and Mr. Clive Davis should share the blame as well. Instead of putting out something that was ""eight years in the making"", it seems like they put together something that was ""eight days in the making."" Sorry Whitney."
2,Not up to par,"Whitney's voice, except for the beautiful duet with Mariah Carey, has changed on this album. Gone are the exploding high notes that used to send me into ecstasy - instead her vocal range seems to have dropped down an octave (or more!) - most likely due to her smoking cigarettes. Whitney: If you haven't already, give up those cancer sticks, girl!! We don't want to see you go the same route as Nat King Cole, Eddie Kendricks, etc."
3,Oh come on Whitney you know you can do better,"This is a somewhat of a low for whitney. I mean the songs are all about the same thing her boyfreind cheated on her, and shes breaking up with her boyfriend, one of the only songs that dosent happen is the album title track which I think sucks but I like the lyrics. recomended songs1.it's not right but its O.K2. Heart break hotel f/ Faith Evens and Kelly Price4.When you believe f/ Mariah Carey7. I learned from the best"
1,Horrible,"This is a misrepresentation. Nothing was like the radio and I could not listen to it before I bought it. I think it should have been labeled more correctly by saying,""None of these songs are or should be on radio."" Very boring. Negative stars for this one. Now I'm stuck with this sorry CD."
1,Horrible!,She was so good back in 85 when she did Saving All My Love For you. Whitney was her last good album. This r&b styled junk stinks. Take a lesson from your cousin Dionne Warwick.
4,"This Ain't The Popish ""I Wanna Dance With Somebody...""","If you are looking for the typical Whitney Houston sound, that is, ""I wanna dance with somebody"" type tracks, this CD is not for you. If you are looking for a R&B album with good production, and, as Oprah puts is it, ""The Voice"", then this album is for you. My favorite tracks are 1,2,6,9,11,& 13 (which is not listed). Those specific tracks have a nice R&B feel. It very hard to purchase a CD where a person likes every song, but if I really like 50% of the tracks, and the other 50% are just okay, I'll still feel like I got a bargain. As far as this album is concerned, even the lower rated tracks are better than average. Thank you Whitney for not just being a POP queen, but demonstrating that you have SOUL. (Went to her concert in Boston last night, she rocked it)."
3,"Not Whitney at her best, still there are great moments.","To me My love is, your love, is not Whitneys greatest c.d.The songs i really love are 'Bowout', 'Oh yeah', 'I learned from the best',and 'Heartbreak Hotel'.The rest of the c.d. is okay. It is not quality i expect from Whitney."
3,A pretty solid experience from Whitney.,"It's no classic but it's good enough.My favorites are:It's Not Right But It's OkayI Was Made To Love HimIf I Told You Thatand Until You Come Back.I like the beat to Oh Yes and have grown to like the song. Until You Come Back, written by Babyface himself is also notable. I Was Made To Love Him is good too. It's a very bouncy track. I don't care too much for You'll Never Stand Alone though.3.8 stars. Good CD but I'm sure that one of her earlier releases is better. But if you enjoy R&B;, then I fully recommend this CD."
5,Great Album Whitney!,"True, alot of people might say this is too contemporary for Whitney. However, nothing stays the same forever. I am so glad she is trying new things. It really worked! Besides, being able to pull this album off is her coronation as the princess of pop. The more things change, the more they remain the same."
4,Whitney Unmixed,"If you've been listening to the radio lately, then you'be probaly heard any one of Whitney's new songs...""It's Not Right..."", ""My Love Is Your Love""; and you go out, buy the CD and find out that it isn't the version on the record...serves you right. Whitney Houston rocks-and this CD deserves to be heard-with no frills. ""My Love Is Your Love"" is a slow groove that soothes your soul, and ""It's Not Right..."", classic R&B that lets you know where Whitney stands. The immensely popular Thunderpuss Dance Mix isn't on here-and thank God-there is no place for it. ""If I Told You That"", my personal favorite, is a roll lickin', who dunit, that needs no introduction, and ""Get It Back', is just plain sexy. Leave the dance mixes for the club and refresh your body, mind, and soul with a little R&B-Whitney style."
5,A sensational album!!!,"This is the work of a truly talented and gifted artist. Whitney Houston's voice is Wow!!! Her voice just blew me away!! Especially on the duet ""when you believe"" with Mariah Carey. Whitney's voice overpower Mariah's. Whitney has it all. She is drop dead gorgeous,talented and that beautiful voice!! Can't wait for more albums in the near future!"
3,"patti, aretha, gladys and the demise of the soul songstress","unfortunately, whitney's most recent album is plagued by two big problems: a voice that is (kindly put) more mature, and material that has less staying powre than bubble gum. i would not like to trash whitney herself, because i don't know her. however, i do think that if even she, a woman with the luxury of having true talent as a singer and an incredible sales record, is compelled to release an album with VERY little artsitic merit, then we are all in a world of trouble. aretha, patti, and gladys made similar mistakes on their recent and forgettable albums. i mean no disrespect to any of these women. each have earned their respect with a proven track record of meaninful music. but thier recent music cannot be excused. so, rather than yell or scream, i turn my head away, sigh, and wait for their revival under better artistic circumstances."
3,it was okay,"the cd was okay some of the tracks were good like the ones you heard on the radio ,but most of the other songs started to all sound the same,it is good if you are a whitney houston fan but for just buying it for the songs be cautious."
3,GOOD - BUT NOT WHINTEY'S BEST!,"We all know Whitney Houston could do better than this. I think my fav Whitney album (besides her GREATEST HITS) is her self-titled 1985 album. There are only a few good songs on this album, and even the Remixes of those songs are better than the versions on this album. My personal favs on this CD are ""It's Not Right But It's Okay"", though the version on this album is too slow and I do not like it. I like the Thunderpuss Mix much better, ""My Love Is Your Love"", and once again, the Jonathan Peters Mix is so much better than the original featured on this album. I also love ""Heartbreak Hotel"", featuring Faith Evans and Kelly Price. And I love ""When You Believe"" - a duet with Mariah Carey, another one of my fav divas. If you want good Pop, then maybe this isn't the CD for you and you should get Whitney's self-titled album and her GREATEST HITS album. But if you're a die-heart Whitney fan, then this is definitely for you!"
2,"It's not right, but just ok.","If not for 'Heartbreak Hotel' and 'It's Not Right, But It's ok' this album is a total bore. 'It's Not Right' sounds better as a remix. 'My Love is Your Love' sounds like 'It's Not Right' pt 2 and the duet with Carey might have been better as a solo. Buy the single remixes, there's more life in those."
1,Whitney has lost what she once had.....,"This album doesn't even compare to Whitney's earlier work. That would be alright if it was better, but she has missed the mark with this one. It seems so poorly planned and written, that one wonders if she should have just stuck with the original plan, and made the greatest hits album. This album is totally devoid of groove or good lyrics. Whitney fans from the late 80's and early 90's, do yourself a favor and don't buy this album. Remember her how she was. Whitney, hang it up, baby."
2,PITIFUL AND DISAPPOINTING,"When I heard that Whitney had a new album, I rushed out to buy it. I have been a Whitney fan from the very beginning, and I couldn't wait to hear her latest compilation. What a disappointment. The songs on this album are a pitiful attempt to appease to 13 and 14 year old kids who know nothing about the texture of music. While there is nothing wrong with an artist experimenting with different styles of music (it keeps the creative juices going), I fear that Whitney chose the style of music on this album only to make sure that Generation X (what a bore) would purchase it. Or maybe, she just can't do the strong ballad anymore due to smoking or perhaps she's too busy monitoring her husband. Anyway, Whitney, go back to the old landmark -- the passionate ballads that made you who you are today. You never really could get the r&b thing down but that's o.k., we love you anyway. Hopefully, you will listen to critical commentary rather than record sales the next time around....."
2,"I HOPE Whitney RETURNS to her: ""I Have Nothing"" Days!!!","I can HONESTLY say that I GREATLY ANTICIPATED the release of this album, but once I HEARD it, I was GREATLY DISSAPOINTED! I think Whitney knows that this IS NOT HER BEST WORK...BY A LOOOONG SHOT!!! The bottom line is, ANYONE can jump on the bandwagon of whats ""POPULAR"" in music, but it takes a TRUE ARTIST to bring CREATIVITY to the table. I beleive Whitney CAN DO IT, WITHOUT A DOUBT...but it's going to take a LITTLE LONGER than TWO MONTHS!!! Until then, I can only REMINISCE on the POWER-HOUSE voice that once took the ""STAR SPANGLED BANNER"" to NEW HEIGHTS."
1,"The music isn't there anymore, the bigheaded girl yes !!","I was a Whitney fan, with her first 2 albums. Till I saw her on stage, she is big headed and has no manners at all. We in Belgium were disappointed. An you see, she knows that here in Europe, e quickly notice this !!"
1,Give it up girl,The only reason why I gave that album 1 star is for When you believe even though that song is pathetically cheesy. Thank you Whitney for outsinging that poor excuse of a singer called Mariah Carey. Celine Dion could easily outsing you on WYB. Be thankful that you had to sing it with Mariah. Celine is so much better live. Take notes Whitney before it becomes too late like in Mariah's case.
1,What an Annoying and Boring CD!,"Whitney Houston has such a loud and annoying voice! How can anyone listen to her?! Her songs are boring, and her voice is repulsive. She's so loud, and what's worse is that after listening to one song, that loud voice has already become annoying! The only halfway-decent song on the entire album is ""When You Believe (From 'The Prince of Egypt)"", with Mariah Carey. Mariah Carey saves the song, but otherwise it's just as bad as the rest of the songs on this album. Whitney Houston's new CD, ""My Love is Your Love"" is definitely for Whitney Houston fans ONLY, because if you don't not like her already, this album will most certainly convince you not to like her!"
1,Whitney's worst album... Sad but true.,"The problem with this album is that Whitney tries something she can't do - to sing R&B. Whitney is ballad/pop singer, and she should do that... ""My Love Is Your Love"" shows that Whitney wants to copy Mariah Carey with this R&B style, the only difference is that Mariah Carey CAN do R&B, Whitney CAN'T. You can hear that this album is made in 6 weeks, it doesn't sound finished. There are some good songs (those typical Whitney ballads), but most of the songs are crap (new style R&B songs)... And even Whitney's voice doesn't sound as good as earlier. This album was very disappointing!"
1,Not Like The Radio,"Songs played on the radio are generally the songs I would like to hear on a CD. Well, this is not the case here. I purchased this CD thinking that her songs would sound very similar to what was played on the radio (because they sounded great!). HOWEVER, when I popped the CD in the player, boy was I surprised! It sounded nothing like what the radio stations played...NOTHING! I think she was a little rap-happy when making this CD. Very poor..I was fooled. Don't you be."
2,item not new,the cd did not have a factory seal. just a plastic cover. I don't think it is brand new as described.
5,WHITNEY HOUSTON IS STILL ON TOP,"I LOVE WHITNEY'S NEW CD!!! SHE HAS DONE A VERY GOOD JOB WITH KEEPING UP WITH THE SOUNDS OF TODAY'S MUSIC AND AT THE SAME TIME, DOING WHAT SHE DOES BEST. MY LOVE IS YOUR LOVE IS ONE OF THE HOTTEST CDS ON THE MARKET TODAY. PEOPLE REALLY DON'T NEED TO PLAYER HATE. IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT, STAY OUT OF HER BUSINESS!!!"
4,It's great,I bought this and I was really surprised that this was Whitney she sounds so soulful she had almost switched over to what I call adult comtemporary I love this alumn it is a must have
4,Whitney! Girl you did it again!,"I had to let this album grow on me, because I was expecting and still want a greatest hits album. I had to get use to the new sound, but Whitney shines in this CD- a story of a relationship full of commitment yet with controversy reflects her own life no matter how much she denies it. Whitney and Mariah blow it up! Whitney sings with a power and a believablity few female singers do."
4,Good,"This is Whitney's first real R&B album, and even though it's above average, there's still room for improvement. ""When You Believe"" is the most uninspirational inspirational song I've ever heard. Everything else is listenable."
3,Lighten up!,"I've been a big fan of Whitney Houston since her debut album back in '85. This record however is sort of a letdown to fans. I purchased ""My Love Is Your Love"" thinking I'd hear the radio version of ""It's Not Right But It's Okay"" among other songs. Not the case. Instead we get the slow version which is a disappointing as the only really good songs on this album are It's Not Right But It's Okay (the dance mix sounds much better) and Heartbreak Hotel. Also in general, I don't like the direction Whitney has taken with this latest album. Where are the fun songs like ""I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me)""? Whitney on this album just seems angry and bitter with songs like ""I Learned From the Best"". Lighten up!"
1,whitney's lost it...,"I just watched her Grammy appearance, and it made me very sad to hear the climax of ""...right...ok"" fizzle out. Her voice used to be so beautiful and crystal clear. She would hold those high notes like there was no tomorrow. Guess that's what happens when ya start smokin ciggarettes and the green stuff... Better luck next time, WHIT!"
1,Not what I heard on the radio,Thank goodness for listening booths! I was going to buy this until I listened to the tracks. They are NOTHING like the ones on the radio and all I can say is YUCK.
1,Not what you are hearing on the radio,This album is not what you are hearing on the radio. My Love Is Your Love is slow and not the version made popular. Whitney may think her album version is artsy but it is not what makes this song popular.
3,GOOD....BUT NOT WHITNEY'S BEST!,"We all know Whitney Houston could do better than this. I think my fav Whitney album (besides her GREATEST HITS) is her self-titled 1985 album. There are only a few good songs on this album, and even the Remixes of those songs are better than the versions on this album. My personal favs on this CD are ""It's Not Right But It's Okay"", though the version on this album is too slow and I do not like it. I like the Thunderpuss Mix much better, ""My Love Is Your Love"", and once again, the Jonathan Peters Mix is so much better than the original featured on this album. I also love ""Heartbreak Hotel"", featuring Faith Evans and Kelly Price. And I love ""When You Believe"" - a duet with Mariah Carey, another one of my fav divas. If you want good Pop, then maybe this isn't the CD for you and you should get Whitney's self-titled album and her GREATEST HITS album. But if you're a die-heart Whitney fan, then this is definitely for you!"
3,you hear it on the radio but its not the same,you listen to its not right but its ok on the radio it has a fast dance beat but on the cd it is like a music box for a beat buy a music box at a carnival it is cheaper
4,Excellent but also like the Re-mixes,"I'm glad for the remixes because they made me buy the album. I love just sitting down and listening to Houston's soulful voice, but I have to go the re-mixes when I want to dance."
5,WHITNEY IS WONDERFUL!,What can I say....the girl can blow!Everything this girl puts her hands on turns gold.From track to the last song is amazing.Whitney girl you deserve a Grammy for this.Keep on keeping on.
2,Good Reading For The Soul But Too Spiritual,"I must say that the book is much better than the audio tape. The book itself however is more for someone who wants to know more on Karma.It does cover aspects of Twin Flames, but it just is not that captivating, as Ms Prophets book on reincarnation.My personal opinion on the book is that it is more on preaching God's word. I would really enjoy finding a book on how you know that you found your twin flame, and what twin flames have in common,not on The Violet Flame,that is mentioned way too may times in this book."
2,Religious,Too religious and didnt really explain the relationship of soulmates and twin flames not a great read and it is pocket size
1,"Reader From Reading, PA","Not much to say about this small book, did not like it. Read much better books on soulmates than this one. Sent it back did not capture my interest at all,and I read alot of spiritual books. But this one, just made no sense to me at all. Just could not even get through it."
2,Nice but not great,I did enjoy this book but felt it not to be as informative as I had hoped. Not a bad book to own but not the best book for serious research on twin souls.
1,Soul Mates and Twin flames,"I feel ashamed that I bought this book, so much so, that i feel sick to my stomach!There No such thing , as a SOUL MATE or a TWIN FLAME! With the man shortage in this world a woman is lucky, to get a coffee date with a guy who is even a quarter of the way decent!!! It was just NEW AGE trash!"
3,Twin Souls and No romance!,"What about those twin souls who are to work together and to not form a romantic relationship? my twin soul and i are here to work divinely together for a higher purpose, get real! twin soul relationships are the most intense form of relationship you could want and to be in romance man, when your there, then see if you actually want it! its hard work on a mere friendship level, will someone please write a book about those who are here for other purposes than romance which is often what twin souls come together for anyway, look at jesus his twin soul was his mother!Blessings and light"
1,Not impressed,"I read many books pertaining to the Twin Flame concept however I must say that this particular book left much to be desired. There are many other books out there that are much more precise and to the point. Perhaps to some this book will be an eye-opener lol..stranger things have happened! I, however,was not impressed."
4,Read for fun,"Someone told me about it so I bought it. Not sure what I believe in it. But, it was an easy and interesting read."
5,Another favorite,I love Bill Peet books and love the hidden messages that I think he wanted us to see when we read them.
5,Classic Bill Peet,"I loved Bill Peet books as a child, and I still really like them today. I recently bought the whole set so that my children will have them, and realized that I remember every character and every plot from 20+ years ago when my parents read them to me. They really made an impact on me. The illustrations are cute and captivating, the characters are engaging, the stories and well told, and each book has a meaning. There are few authors who can create such a fine balance in childrens' books."
1,A complete rip-off !,The Java search project is not available as the book claims. The Java code in the book is of *lousy* quality. The project's design is so bad that it would require and entire redesign/rewrite to make it work. Publisher claims the author's can't be found. A real piece of work!
3,Teenage Troubles,"LBD it's a girl thing is a funny and witty book about the life of three teenage girls: Fleur, Claudia, and Ronnie. In the story the girls desperately want to go to the Astlebury music festival, but their parents won't let them. Claudia comes up with the idea to have their own music festival at their school. The girls face a few problems along the way like: Ronnie's parents' separation and Panama and her band, the girls' enemies are the headline act in the festival. After a few bumps everything works out and the festival is a great sucess. Ronnie gets the boy she has a major crush on and her parents get back together. She also has a new sibling on the way. As an added surprise, Superstar Mike Saunders comes to the festival and sings a few songs for the perfect ending. I think that the book was a tad bit boring and the plot was weak. I also thought that it was very humorous and realistic when it comes to how teenage girls act these days."
4,The Biggest Party of the Year,"There is supposed to be a rockin music festival called,""Aslebury Music Festival "". It is going to be an awesome party. It will have loud music, crowd-surfing, and staying up all night. There is this group of girls called the LBD that can't go. Their parents will not let them go. They get all mad, and decided that they were going to have their own awesome party. This party will be featuring the most talented students at Blackwell School. They are having trouble finding funds needed to make this party happen.I liked this book because it was about a teenager's life. I thought that it was very interesting at times. I didn't like it because it took to long to get interesting. I would recommend this book to most teenage girls that aren't tomboys."
5,Seller gave great customer service,"Although the box was in good shape, one glass globe arrived broken. The seller sent a free replacement immediately. Product also as described and good quality."
3,Pretty good but too much babble,"I checked this out at the library and thought it had good information about how to cut your expenses and the author convinced me to pay off my mortgage early rather than putting my extra money into the stock market. The first few CD's are very entertaining. The last two CD's don't contain any useful information and are somewhat out of scope. For instance, in the last CD he spends a significant amount of time talking about why only one parent should work because it's better on the kids. He also goes on and on about how to be an asset to your company so you will get raises and not get laid off. This is the type of CD that you will only listen to once so I highly recommend checking it out at your local library and saving the cash. After all, you do want to cut down on debt, right?"
2,Only if you want to be a Miser,"If you want to live like Eboneezer Scrooge, perhaps this is the book for you. However, the author promotes a very miserly approach to creating wealth. Sadly, by the time you have wealth, you'll be too obsessed with not spending 10 cents more for a bag of potato chips in the flavor you really want. The basic financial principles he is teaching are classic Dave Ramsey. While these are great tools to use, I'd recommend buying something by Ramsey or Orman as opposed to this book. Likewise, if you are serious about becoming wealthy, you NEED to read ""Rich Dad, Poor Dad"" by Robert Kiyosaki. It is a must!Overall though, I'd have to say that you should stay away from this book unless you absolutely need to count every single penny in your budget."
2,Not as realistic...,"As a professional financial advisor and CPA, this program truly undermines the real effects of interest rates and opportunity costs. The author makes the whole process sound so easy but truth is there heavy consequences. What John is teaching is simple as ""PAY MORE (accelerated margin) and GET OUT OF DEBT FASTER"" - which is a no-brainer. Well... if you are living paycheck to paycheck how will you come up with extra $400~$600? John will tell you to drink less coffee, eat less, etc... I just wonder if the author has any finance background..."
5,THE BEST INFORMATION ON MONEY I HAVE EVER HEARD,i think this information should be taught in schools.this information is life changing.i wish everyone in the whole world would listen to these tapes.(GREAT) ...
1,If it's too good to be true...,"it probably is.I wish to thank the spammers that continually pummel my mailbox with nonsense get rich schemes such as good ole John Cummuta.From what I can see this clown uses the internet and search engines such as Google to make himself rich by you poor saps buying his get rich and prosper BS.Ever notice no negative feedback on this get rich eventually scheme?It even looks as if he's found a way to ""salt"" the reviews on Amazon.I wish all these get rich clowns would just take a long walk off a short pier!"
3,Robert Cuenca is not paying attention.,"Robert Cuenca is a knucklehead. That's why you rent the property. You are not paying the mortgage, the renter is. I personally own 5 rental properties. If you do your research and purchase real estate in a smart way, then you WILL make money. There are EXTREEMEY RARE social and economic cases that see real estate depreciate. Do you own due diligence before you start calling people names."
3,Full of Good Advice That's Somewhat Out of Date,"This book was a quick, easy read done in one afternoon. The advice itself was not bad at all in a general, where-do-I-start sense, but judging by the pricing author Spellman used for domain names and hosting, this book is badly out of date.When I went to its ""sister website"" at musiciansinternet.com, nothing showed up. A whois search revealed a registrant located in Malaga, Spain, so I don't know what's really going on here. Perhaps Berklee Press would be wise to keep its sites really up to date to expand on the book as promised within its pages.All in all though, this book does contain valuable suggestions, including some rather obvious ones as well as the more obscure. And it is written and organized in a very easy to read manner with no circuitous technical jargon or other stuff to weigh things down.Bottom line: good info, quick read, but the book is out of date and its companion website nowhere to be found."
2,Badly outmoded,"I had purchased this book based on the overall set of good reviews here but instantly smelled trouble from the first sentence on page 1, which reads, ""The Internet (or 'Net' for short..."") I'm surprised the author didn't go on to say how the 'Net' is also considered the cat's pajamas & bee's knees. 3/4ths of the helpful music industry links cited in the pages lead to dead end error pages. Some useful advice can be found but overall, the information about cultivating an online presence as a musician can also be culled from looking at your favorite artists' pages for ideas."
4,Excellent,"The World Wide Web is now a major portal for the music industry to ""infect"" the masses, and the producers are all for this expansion into the modern world. The internet has now become a launch pad for many small record labels that find it easier to survive a virtual environment than a real one. Things that novices don't know can kill the company from the start , things that are explained in this book using an easy structure and light information. Unfortunately, the book is just light, ""The New Music Industry: How to Use the Power of the Internet to Multiply Your Industry Exposure, Fan Base and Income Potential Online!"" by Ty Cohen is the complete book that give you all the insights into successful online business"
2,An average book,"The book is ok. Its well written, and raises some valid points, however the issue is presented almost totally in an 'America-vs-Islam' context. The main conflicts Qureshi deals with involve post 9-11 America v certain parts of the Middle East and Israel-Palestine.Qureshi has missed a major oppertunity to investigate other conflicts which involve Islam. Why does he not discuss Kashmir, Chechnya, Southern Thailand, Timor, Ughur/Western China? All of these conflicts have a religous dimension to them, and all of them are often talked about by Radical Jihadists, yet none of them really involve the US or Israel. His lack of attention to this means his book has just become another generic study which simplifies the whole issue.Overall it is an ok book, and from an academic point of view it does provide an alternative to Huntingdon's theory. But sadly it has a narrow scope and leaves too many crucial questions unanswered."
5,Nice Muslims,"Muslims is nice. Don't smite me, please. I am good on Islam, yes? I vote 5 stars for this nice nice book!"
5,Another excellent book,"Any book written by the Campanellis is to be recommended. They speak of living the old ways from the heart, easy to understand and incorporate into your beliefs and into your day to day life."
5,Good Tool,A solid built impact sockets. Get all the bolt out without a problem with this sockets. Great tool to have for the price it cost.
4,"Unexpected, twisted little gem","Full disclosure: I rented this film because a former boyfriend of mine was the director of photography and I was curious to see what he'd been up to. For a low-budget film, it is gorgeously filmed (good job, Matt Faw!) and well acted. Given the title and the word ""erotic"" on the cover, I was expecting the plot to evolve into a kinky threesome, but instead its twistedness takes a whole different route. It starts out normally enough: a couple who's stressed out from trying to get pregnant takes a vacation and allows another couple they don't really know to house-sit. When they get back, the house-sitters won't leave. The mind-games quickly escalate and eventually turn violent and unexpectedly (but very inventively) sadistic. Not a date movie, but definitely worth watching if you like odd, twisted, offbeat films. (And the director's commentary only added to my appreciation of the cast and crew's achievement.)"
2,Cleopatra needs to go back to 1st husband,"I'm not going to tell you how the movie ended like the previous poster had, thank you very much. If you like diabolical movies, then add this to your list of ones to watch. It's predictable in a many ways with a sick surprising ending. I wasn't enjoying it much and not too enthuses about this cuz it's not my type of movie and i would not watch it again due to the nature of the subject matter which is twisted. My question is 'who is the 2nd husband of cleopatra?' which is what i was trying to figure out during the whole movie."
1,bought the wrong movie.,"i think i bought the wrong movie,and couldn't return it because didn,t watch it till return policy was over.did not even finished watching it.i wish you guys can replace it with something better."
2,"Sometimes illuminating, but mostly rambling, dull and pretentious","This book was sort of a sprinter. It started off interesting with pretty solid essays on post-WWII America. But towards the end I found it pretty hard to get through. When Henry's writing works, it's really good stuff, but when it doesn't it seems dated and pretentious. I found his narrative of a Hollywood party to be useless and his long winded tirade about war to be about as valid as some drunk at a bar. It's interesting how Miller's stream-of-consciousness style of writing may have permanently changed modern literature, but if it came out today, I doubt anybody would take it seriously"
2,"Hard to read, kinda disappointing","I was all excited for this, and then it wasn't so good. The writing of the Jack Cole story was ok, but actually I think Plastic Man is kinda bogus. (JC is no Jack Kirby.) And I didn't need to see a reproduction of his note to Hugh Heffner. The reviewer who said the layout of this book was hard to read was right on. Yuck.You're probably better off getting something like Wonder Woman archives (although it's not necessarily better drawn).Sometimes you try new stuff and it doesn't work out. Oh well."
1,Disappointed in shameless exploitation,"As someone who has lived in Russia for 2 years (St. Petersburg for 18 mos) I am disappointed in what would seem to be a shameless exploitation of Gogol. The title openly suggests a degree of familiarity with Gogol's ""The Overcoat"". But it is not. I am sure most, if not all, Russians, especially those in St. Petersburg, would be offended by the intent of the title of this book.The story itself is okay. It's entertaining enough for kids. Change the title and maybe you get 3 stars. But to rely on such a cheap trick, as name association, diminishes any respect this story might otherwise receive."
3,"Works great, but...","This barking deterrent DOES work very well for us. We have it aimed at the large neighbor dog that explodes into a loud barking frenzy everytime a leaf or anything else blows by. What's neat is that you can see when this device is emitting the ultrasonic frequency by a little green light that comes on.However, even though we have this device adjusted to the most super-sensitive setting, it still fails to come on sometimes when the dog is barking right in front of it, only 6 feet away. So, if I happen to be outside, I will walk over to this Bark Smart (the sound of my footsteps approaching makes the dog go even more nuts) and tap my fingernail right on the microphone. That always activates the device, but makes me suspicious that it is designed poorly."
4,80% Effective,I've been using it for my chihuahua and jack russel and I'd say its cut their barking down to about 80% of what it was before. They only really bark now if they feel its worth the sharp noise they hear. And they bark as far away from the Barksmart as they can.I guess that's better than before! Maybe I need 2 so I can put one at the other end of my yard.
4,Pretty Good,"I can't believe Barksmart works, but it does. My neighbor's dogs were driving my wife crazy but Barksmart has reduced their barking significantly. I think I will buy another unit for the othet side of my yard."
2,Mic Range,"The mic range on this unit is too short. My neighbors dog is locked up about 15 feet from our fence so that is the closest i can attach the unit. needless to say, the thing never comes on without manual activation (tapping your finger directly on the mic)."
1,"Activates when knocked hard; otherwise, just a waste of electricity...","This device activates only when I knock on the microphone; otherwise, it does not detect sounds at all even when set to the highest sensitivity.My dogs ran away when I managed to make it generate sound, so perhaps it would work if it could sense that that they are barking.It's going back..."
1,Didn't work on my dog...,"I really wanted this gadget to work, but unfortunately it did not. Smarthome was great about refunding my money though."
4,Real Estate Principles,Ended up not taking this class at the time however the book received was in great shape and will use it in the future. Thank you.
5,great book,"The book came in less than a week and was in great condition. The seller was also a great communicator and I sent a couple of e-mail and he or she wrote back within 24 hours. Overall, really great service, even though this is the first time I have shopped with this seller, I would highly recommend this seller."
2,wasn't the last even the 11th edition,"I thought was the last edition (11th), but it's the 10th edition when I received... they should have posted and said which edition the book was and should not use the wrong cover for the ad (different edition, use different color for the book cover). The product description should have been more details."
3,In between,"Unlike the first 2 reviews of this book, my opinion falls somewhere in between. While this is not the most comprehensive or profound book on art therapy, it is a practical guide for practitioners who need lots of ideas for group activities. How well they work depends on the skills and insight of the group leader, as well as the readiness of the group participants. One of my art therapy students bought this book recently and found it quite useful. For the more advanced practitioner, it might feel a bit too much like a recipe book. I recommend it as one tool in your art therapy toolbox."
2,Hoping for more,"I'm actually disappointed in the book. The content is not clear, the exercises are vague. all in all a disappointment for me. Maybe my expectations were too high. Going to give it more time this week. If I'm wrong by the tie I'm finished, I'll recant."
2,A disappointment. More vinettes than ideas for groups.,Confusing and boring reading. Only a small portion is dedicated to group ideas. A real disappointment.
4,what a wonderful read,"Paul Halmos is regarded as one of the few mathematicians who can write well and engage his audience. He does not disappoint here. It is wonderful overview for us, naive persons, of the main logical and set theory axioms that are used today as a basis of everyday mathematics. The ideas of statements, relations and axioms gave me what I needed to understand a bit better my main interest....diff. geometry....and it's extensive set notation. Countable sets and powers of infinity helped with the ideas of analysis and it's sets of infinite series and sequences. So if logic and set theory exist only as union and intersection operations from your elementary school days, and is what got you you're engineering degree, then this is the book for you. It will give you a good idea of how set theory proofs are conceived and written. It gives you a taste of just how deep the rabbit hole goes."
2,A contrarian opinion,"I beg to differ with other reviewers of this book. Although the book may have been regarded as a classic in its time, it cannot be recommended as a source for either self-study or as a reference book on set theory by present-day standards for mathematical writing. Its style varies from too concise to too verbose in an erratic manner. It attempts to combine rigor and lack of rigor, and does so inconsistently. There are no references to other works. Finally, I was particularly turned off by the last sentence of the Preface, the pompous and patronizing ""read it, absorb it, and forget it."" Those who are interested in elementary set theory are advised to consult the books by Robert Stoll and Patrick Suppes. Besides being much better written and more comprehensive, they are also cheaper."
4,not bad for the money,"While the glasses were a lot smaller than I had anticipated, they were none the less very nice quality glasses. And for the price, by far the best I could find on the internet."
4,Entertaining,"The more I read Charles Solomon's anime reviews, the more I realize he doesn't have a clue what he's talking about. Taro is not 8 years old. It's never mentioned in the show, but it says plain as day on the back of the DVD case that Taro is a 3rd year middle school student. For those of us who can count, that ought to be about 8th grade and 13 to 14 years of age. And for most normal males, that's not pre-pubescent.Now, on to the show. It's quite funny at times, though a little predictable. FYI: there's a lot of nudity in the first episode. Everything after that is very tame."
1,A stinkaroo!,"The premise is funny: murders occur at an conference about Edith Wharton, an opportunity to puncture academic pretensions. But the humor is forced, the characters cardboard, the mystery uninvolving, the important clues unrevealed to the very end. Skip it."
1,It's an awful book.,"I'm an Edith Wharton fan and collector and couldn't resist this book because of its title. I should have especially since money and time were involved--I bought instead of borrowed, harcover no less, and regret the time wasted on this silly, pretentious book. What Raphael writes about one of his characters, a writer, applies to this book ""...Books with far-fetched plots, shallow but showy characters, and improbable coincidences."""
1,Too Awful for Words,"I bought this book from a bargain book table on a rainy day, and thought I'd have a pleasant afternoon's reading. Unfortunately, this book reads like a bad soap opera with clunky, wooden dialogue and completely uninteresting/improbable characters...I was absolutely amazed at how bad this book was. The connection to Edith Wharton is so thin as to be practically non-existent, so there is no need to read this book if you have any appreciation of Edith Wharton; or even if you have any appreciation of well written mysteries. PASS ON THIS!!!!!!!!"
4,Indians of the Oaks,"This book dovetails with 4th grade California History curriculum very nicely. Although it was written in 1978 by an older writer whose style is very much from an earlier day, the stories are engaging, the details vivid, and the drawings were accurate enough to provide models of the various tools the Kumeyaay Indians used on a daily basis. In this book you will find two great adventure stories, along with Kumeyaay folktales, songs, recipes and games. It is a great cultural resource, and a story that even engaged my 5 year old, who kept asking for more!"
2,Other Models:,"Several other models have the same body look as Affirmed.BarbaroCigarWinsome AdanteSunday SilenceAin't nothing special about this model, except the color."
4,Great Game!,"This is by far the best Harry Potter game for the console. the graphics are incredible and are fast. If you earn enough Quidditch cards, you can change the speed of the game(Cleansweep,Nimbus 2000,2001 and the legendary Firebolt).It took me about an hour to beat the challenges and the Hogwarts Cup but I haven't beaten the World Cup yet. Awesome!!!"
4,great game!!!!,this game was fantastic! I MEAN AWESOME this is the bestgame if u liked all the other harry potter games ull like this 1 the best! thats all but i hope u found this helpful i recommend u spend your money on this game that any other one
4,Heaven Bound,"Shana Petrone has a nice refreshing voice. I just don't understand why an singer with three videos out still doesn't have her first album released. I have seen the video for This Time, Heaven Bound, and Something Real on CMT. She has been a featured new artist for the last month. She truly does have an amazing voice and style."
5,Eagerly awaiting more,"Shana's latest single, ""This Time"", is excellent. I've seen the video a few times, and she really does a beautiful job. The song is simple and she backs it up with her angelic voice. I can't wait for the full length CD. Love ya Shana, keep em coming."
4,"Heavenbound is a phenomenal, powerful song.","I only gave the album a 4, 'cause I haven't been fortunate to listen to the whole thing. I have known Shana for many years, and I think she may have finally found her niche. This doesn't sound like any ""one hit wonder"". I hope this one really soars. 'Cause you deserve it, Tiny. Lots of Love."
3,funny but not what i was after,i was hoping to find some mitch hedberg b/c i love him but this was a variety of comedians and most of them were not very funny.
4,Beautiful,"This ring is very beautiful. The package showed up ultra fast and was well packed. The amber is absolutely gorgeous and the silver is stamped. The setting is not curved to conform to the hand. I'm not sure if that is intentional or if it is machine pressed and assembled. Even so, this is a lovely piece."
3,"Nice size, pretty, but could be better","Color I received was not green, honey and gold amber. I got green, honey and cream/clear amber.Like the size of the ring. I have small hands but like good size rings.This one is visually noticeable and is quite pretty so I am keeping it.However, this ring is rather cheaply made.The ring is a simple thin silver circle with the amber teardrops set on top.No design or heft to the band itself.The teardrops are attractive in shape and size.But like other reviewers, I wish the teardrops hugged the shap of the finger.The three teardrops are connected in a flat manner and would not allow adjustment to curve downward.Ring would be great if it had slight curved shape.I ordered this with matching teardrop shaped tri-color earrings from same companyCertified Genuine Multicolor Amber Sterling Silver Pandora Dreams Leverback EarringsAnd the earrings are terrific.Shipping was fast, well packed."
3,Okay,The ring is okay. Wish the stones were set more contoured to your finger. The fact they're not make the product seem cheap.
4,Dexter Wilburg,"This is a wonderful collection of the Brahms Symphonies, especially the third. However I am at a loss to understand why the boxed set of four CDs costs more--twice as much actually-than the single editions."
4,Works Great,"I used this for installing aproximately 2,000 square feet of metal roofing and siding. Works great for the price. I got it brand new for $79.95 at Home Depot"
5,Still Good after all these years,"I bought this cd in 1990 and have been playing it ever since. If you were a fan of early Soul II Soul and Loose Ends, this is a must have for any Pure RB/Soul eficiando. The british do it better that the americans. Some lessons could be learned by listening to this CD. Pauline Henry voice carries such power, you will be overwhelmed by Love So Tender and Love Come to My Mind. The back beats make you either jump up and boggie or just sit back and let the music take over. I could on, so just buy it and you will not be dissappointed."
4,very good...,"I get on our three story roof here and there (in the past with no harness). I feel much, much safer wearing this harness and I believe it was a great price for the complete set."
3,A not very successful introduction to nanotechnology,"This is another of those books written with only a superficial understanding of the subject. While there is some good material here, the author's attempt to explain What It All Means are superficial and mostly failures.It doesn't help that he consistently confuses atom-manipulating nanotechnology with nanotechnology as the term is used in industry today. Today's working nanotechnology -- and there is a lot of it --- is better described as microscopic monolithic technology. It mostly uses techniques adapted from semiconductor fabrication to produce very small structures by subtractive processes. But it is not about moving atoms around. It's much larger than that.For all that some of what he says in interesting at a superficial level."
1,high school paper,"This is a high school level paper expanded with large print, wide margins and long citations of an encyclopedia. Why it was ever published I have no idea."
4,Probably the Most Recorded Musician Ever,"""Drums! Drums! A Go Go"" is an apt title for this CD. Hal Blaine's playing is excellent as always, but I think the Ventures were better at doing surf instrumentals. The digital remastering by Bill Inglot and Dan Hersh sounds great. The main reason I only gave this 4 stars is for the overdubbed audience noise. I also recommend the book ""Hal Blaine and the Wrecking Crew"" on MixBooks, although it is a bit skimpy on facts."
5,Sometimes silly feels sooo good...,"Plodding along in a rut? Having way too many serious thoughts and conversations? Well, curl up and enjoy ""Rat""! This is a delightful, silly story, with a super-good soundtrack and terrific actors!! It's one of those rare gems you can enjoy over and over again and smile every time!"
5,RJ partially demystified,"If you are looking for a guide to all those weird tunings and a note by note glimpse into the music of Robert Johnson, this work is all you need. If you are looking at how to actually sound like him, you'll probably need something more, like the videos from Homespun. But put the two together and you'll be as close as you can get to being on your way to the crossroads without living the life he did."
4,The complete Robert Johnson!,"This book contains tuitar tablature and music for every song by the legendary bluesman Robert Johnson, who has inspired many blues greats (Muddy Waters and Eric Clapton are two I can think of. ""Eric Clapton Unplugged"" has two or three Johnson tunes on it!) It covers every detail, including special tunings and capo placements. If you want to play Robert Johnson tunes like they were played by the man himself, you want this book!"
5,Very inlightnig,After checking out the tunings used on these transciption it makes you wonder if the devil did tune Roberts guitar .
5,Alternate take of Cross Road Blues,"It looks to me like the author has transcribed the ALTERNATE TAKE (or ""Take 2"") of Cross Road Blues in this book, not the original take like all the other songs.Just an FYI.. for all you other pickers out there struggling with this book!"
5,NOTE:,"FYI: The picture on the cover (taken from a stmap) was altered by United State Postal Service, when Robert Johnson was recently put on a postage stamp. They removed the cigarette, not the author/publishers of this book."
4,On my second pair,"I bought a pair of these from a local store a while back and decided to go with them again from Amazon. The material is different (softer and hopefully more durable) but they're otherwise the same. You should get a couple years of good use out of them. My one caution is to be careful of the sizing--they seem to run a little large. I had the XL before and figured I'd get that again, but the new XL pair were a good bit larger than the previous XL."
5,Nice work from Mark Norman,"I don't know much about Mark Norman, but he exemplifies some pretty nice trance here. There are a bunch of Mark Norman remixes, plus it has Tiesto. I got lost in this mix immediately. Kinda reminiscent of Tiesto overall, if anybody. The good thing about this mix is it doesn't get repetitive at all, which a lot of decent trance even does. Good synthesizer sounds & cool vocals on Forever. The best tracks are Re:locate by Passion, Primer-the silver lining, Smith and Pledger:forever, & Mark Norman:Phantom Manor. If the world of trance was less competitive, this would be a competitor. I say buy it if you are familiar with Mark Norman, cause a lot of the mixes are kinda average. It seems this is a more mature mix of typical club anthems, such as Castles made of sand. I don't think you would hear this in a club, except for maybe interludes. The only negative is that dynamically it isn't versatile, except for on the last track."
3,Cute drawings of baby animals,"This is a really basic board book for young children. The front cover shows rabbits, but they are not mentioned anywhere in the book. The book has nice illustrations of a calf, a lamb, a koala, bear cubs, a joey, a seal pup, piglets, ducklings, a chimp, and an elephant calf. The illustrations are actually all very nice. Each page depicts one animal with name listed in large letters."
3,Fine but unremarkable...,"I love Christmas music, and I love a cappella music, so I was very naturally inclined to appreciate this album. And though it's certainly tolerable, it's not one of my favorites.This particular album is among a whole series of albums produced and arranged by the same people, and presumably sung by the same ensemble. The entire series has a similar sound, which has some similarity to the Christian group Glad (with all of the bop-bops), though Glad is all-male and this group is male-female.In any case, some of the songs are over-arranged, in which the melody is almost lost among all of the flourishes. Musical theorists may enjoy this degree of complexity, but to an average listener like myself, I don't prefer it.The quality of the singers is solid, and the blend of the group is good. Though this isn't one of my favorites, it's something that I listen to a few times each Christmas season. It won't blow anyone away, but at a good price, it's not a bad album to have."
3,COLUMBO?,"Well, the best I can say is, it IS Columbo...but not the one that I would have wanted! Interesting enough, the movies that give you the least information about what is contained in the product is the one that you wind up NOT wanting to purchase!Now that I have it, it's not worth returning, the quality of the discs are not bad....but the contents were pretty much not interesting...one thing for sure, it's a good reason to not buy another one!"
5,Love It,These Columbos have given us so much pleasure to watch. I have ordered all seven seasons and would recommend them to anyone.
5,Columbo DVD's,"Being a Columbo fan and growing up with the TV series, the quality of these DVD's are as good as the originals. I have all seven seasons of DVD's at this point and everyone of them have been excellent and to my expectations."
5,Why wasn't there?,"There are a lot of columbo movies I like, and the series went up to 9 series. Why wasn't there a 10th series?I am very interested in a title movie starring of course Peter Falk and Rod Steiger, Title of episode"" STRANGE BEDFELLOWS.Released in May 8, 1995. Episode #65 Season number 10; Product Code: 82301.Under TV Movie; not in a series. This above information I had to track down until I found it, cause in some of the movies it don't read all of what the movie is about.However, is it possible that I can order or get this Episode #65 Title: Strange Bedfellows?Please let me know of this by writing to my e-mail address at: [...]Thank you truly, James KellerAnd make a 10th series universal studios, just don't stop at the 9th series."
3,Columbo - The Complete Sixth and Seventh Seasons,ONE SHOW WAS REALLY UNDER PARR BUT THE REST WERE GOOD - DIDN'T HAVE ANY EXTRAS LIKE MRS. COLOMBO EPISODE THAT THE LAST TWO SETS HAD - WHAT A BUMMER - WOULD LIKE MRS. COLOMBO TO COME OUT NEXT?TRAVIS PEOPLES
5,Classic detective series - comes to an untimely end.,Columbo is one of the most enjoyable and timeless police detective dramas to ever be brought to our living room via the made for TV movie. Rumor is that the sixth and seventh season will be the last. What about all the Columbo movies made in the 90's? They were just as good and worthy of being brought to DVD?The format is unique in that you see the crime happen and then watch Columbo solve it - the fun is trying to find the piece of information Columbo will use to catch the killer at the last minute. It is surprising how many times (even though you watched the crime be committed) he solves it in a way you never saw coming.The DVD quality is good - I now own season one through seven. Please bring out the later years so my Columbo collection will be complete.
4,"Columbo - ""Next Generation"" ?","I realize regretfully that seasons 6 & 7 are the last of the First Generation, but what about the Second Generation of Columbo episodes and TV Movies that came out as of 1989 to 2003 ? I believe there are 2 seasons with 10 espisodes and 14 TV Movies.Let us all keep our fingers and toes crossed that they come out on DVD before too long. I will keep watching for them. At least I have them all on tape from TV but there is nothing like owning the DVD sets.Does anyone know more about the ""Second Generation"" as I call it ?"
4,Gut Wrenching,"Tom Konkle and Dave Beeler are comic genius. Why they don't have their own TV show on cable yet is beyond me. In this rare and funny ensemble show, TARC, causes you to cry with laughter. Like their predecessors Monty Python the lines stay with you for days afterward, you find yourself mumbling to yourself and people look at your strangely, but then they smile. I'd put Tom/Dave and crew up against Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, SNL, Mad TV anytime.The Archaeology Of Comedyis a jewel, a wonderfully comic turd in the toilet bowl of propriety. And while there is no ""funny bone in the fossil record"" I heartily recommend digging this as soon as possible."
2,Not my cup of tea,"I did not enjoy this video. I wish it had been more Pythonesque - however, everyone has her/his own taste and it was obviously enjoyed by many of the other reviewers."
5,I love all these short stories.,"Wish they would bring this on DVD, I have loved all these short stories. Good actors good stories, I recommend it highly"
3,"One story of three is good, the othes are average on this VHS Book Five",Not some of the best episodes are on this VHS. It is becoming very rare and hard to find becuae the DVD series came out. One of the three stories is any good. The bonus to buying this VHS tape is that it has two stories which are not on the DVD or any other tape at this time.I would recomend that you buy the VHS volume 1 OR the DVD series which is WELL worth the money for the amount of stories you get and the quality. This VHS book 5 is not very good comapred to the rest of the series.-Daniel
4,"Lots of Info, Lacks Aural Aspect","I had to have this book for a college music theory class, ""Rudiments of Music I"". It has a lot of useful information in an easy to understand format, which is awesome for the college student who have about a million other books that they have to read.One improvement that could be made it to add a companion audio CD or CD-ROM. The aural training would be extremely useful when learning about the scales, especially the minor scales or when talking about perfect, major, minor, diminished or augmented pitches. Understanding would greatly increase if you could hear them.I thought that the book was a bit overpriced, considering that it is paperback with pictures and little text.If you just want to see the different aspects of music and be able to identify them on a piece of sheet music, this is a good book. If you want to pick out the different aspects of music when you hear them, find a CD that you can use in conjunction with this bok."
5,music book,the book came quickly and was in condition described... very useful...good purchase...would order from company again
3,Basic Materials in Music Theory,"i really liked the price i saw when i was about to purchase the book. but the problem i have is that it took to long for it to get to my house. i think there should be another faster way to send it, even if its more money, sometimes people just want their things done quickley. another thing is that the book was already answer which in my case, i dont like. i would have prefer to see a note where it says that the book has the answers already."
3,Dog Agility Set,"I bought this toy for myself as I am big into agility with my two shelties. The tunnel arrived ripped, the base of the teeter was broken in three contacts and the teeter itself was broken in half. The concept is great. The quality is junk."
3,Broke first time we used it,"I was so excited to find this product because it was similar to one a friend had and my grandson loved to play with that one. Unfortunately the pieces is this set started to break almost immediately. The chain holding the hoop to the frame broke the first time we tried to put the dog through the hoop; the pegs of the weave section won't stay in (I even tried putting a little putty in the holes to keep the pegs from falling out), and the fabric tunnel for the dog to go through is too long for my grandson to push the dog out the other end. I gave it to my grandson for Christmas and by Easter my daughter told me I should keep it at my house for him to play with when he visits. (Translated, that means ""it has too many little parts and they get lost all the time, it falls apart too fast, I want to throw it away but since it was a gift I don't want to hurt your feelings."") I would not recommed it unless it was to be kept on a shelf looking pretty and never touched."
5,Beautiful Album! Beautiful Singer!,"I love Emilia's voice it is so pretty and unique, it has that signature Ethiopian vibrato in her voice and it is so melodic (she is part Ethiopian and part Swedish), the album is graced with pretty, beautiful melodies...Even though it's in Swedish and i cant understand it, I love the melodies and the instrumentation on this album, I love all the songs, among my faves are lag mig att alska which sounds like r&b the melody on this one is superb, Det Är Inte Det du Säger and Var minut, which has a a wonderful melody as well. also, Fotspr I Snön has a jazzy sound to it, plus the little snippet towards the end whcih is the title track sma ord av karlek is very nicely done as well, i love this album!!! 5 stars all the way!!!"
5,A Childhood Favorite,"This was one of my favorite books as a child. It's the story of the Pilgrims and the first Thanksgiving, and has more details and facts than most books about the Pilgrims that are written for children. The illustrations are charming black and white drawings. I read it to my grandchildren, and they loved it too!"
1,Not worth the paper it's printed on.,"Restall presents an awkward introduction to formal logic. Explanations are convoluted and a chore to disseminate from the text. The book features several errors in both the main text and exercises which can only do harm to the reader. Explanations come across as muddled intertwined with a very casual and imprecise literary style. If you are looking for a straight forward and clear introduction to propositional and first order logic, look elsewhere."
2,very good book! but very bad formatting for Kindle.,This book is very concise and efficient introduction to Logic. I would highly recommend for boginners of logic. But Kindle edition has critical flaws in formatting. especially tables and boxes.
1,Do not get the kindle edition,"I first bought the kindle edition of this book for a class I have this semester. I ended up buying the paperback due to formating issues on some symbols (such as the symbol for inference). This makes the book basically unusable on kindle, especially for a student since guessing at which symbol ought to be in the missing place is probably not wise."
3,I just want the No Seeum netting,"I am surprised I cannot just buy ""No Seeum"" netting. Anyway, I found this kit comes with some No Seeum netting so I ordered it. I was so excited when I got the package. I thought finally I would be able to fix my tent. I was very much in shock when I found out it had everything but the ""No Seeum"" netting. That is the only reason I bought this kit. I was so mad that I could not go camping with my friends, so I exchanged it(Usually I will not bother to exchange, I hate returning or exchanging stuff.) The company shipped the replacement right away and I got the right item. I am still a little bitter everytime I saw this package."
5,Perfect for active toddler,"We purchased this swing to replace a standard swing on a new playset for our 2yr old little girl. She's too little for a standard swing, but doesn't want to use the ""baby swing"" anymore. This swing is very sturdy and durable, the coated chain is pinch-proof for little fingers.She can lean forward without falling out and it's comfortable enough that she's even fallen asleep in it. We are very happy with this swing."
4,Great purchase,We ordered 2 of these for our new swing set since our toddler isn't ready for a traditional swing....arrived super-quick. Appears to be very sturdy. Very happy with this purchase.
1,"Great product, but buy it at Costco!","I just received this product, and it looks great - sturdy and well constructed. I expect it to last many years. I noticed it was shipped directly from <...>, so I checked it out. This seller bought directly from Costco for $49.99, including shipping. Considering I paid over $80 with shipping, I feel I got ripped off! If you don't have a Costco membership find someone who does because it's worth the savings! <...>"
5,Toddler bucket swing,"This is a great swing! Just like the toddler bucket swings at the park. Its a bit expensive, but well worth the price. The coated chain is a nice touch. My 2 year old absolutely loves this swing! Highly recommend if you need a toddler bucket swing for your playset."
4,Trustworthy Quality Toddler Swing,"We looked at the usual chain stores for a safe sturdy toddler swing and were generally unsatisfied with what we saw. When we found this one on Amazon and read the reviews - overall they were good but inconsistent. We decided to try the Gorilla. Wow, we were so glad we tried it. This swing is like a tank compared to the others we had examined. It has a heavy duty chain, but is coated in plastic so as not to pinch little fingers. The bucket has a high back and we felt completely safe with our two year old granddaughter swinging in it. She is a calm child and not trying to turn flips or anything - could not imagine her turning it over. We had a great time swinging her in this swing.Only criticism: The chain is sturdy but quite heavy - makes the whole swing a bit on the heavy side - needs to have a strong sturdy support to hang it on. Perhaps a chain made of a lighter composite would be better - but undoubtedly more expensive."
3,A mixed bag,"The highlight here is Kurtag's ""Stele,"" a lament for very full orchestra which alternates angry outbursts with passages of bleak, glacier-like stasis. A good piece with some interesting sonorities. ""Grabstein"" is another lament, quieter and for a smaller ensemble.Stockhausen is a composer I just don't ""get."" I've tried several times, but his music still strikes me as gimmicky and self-indulgent. But whaddaya expect from a guy who claims he was born on the star Sirius? ""Gruppen"" is one of his best-known pieces. There are some interesting noises on display here, but I can't see this piece becoming a favorite of mine. Furthermore, there are spatial aspects (it's for 3 orchestras playing at once) that the recording just can't bring out. Also, DG deserves a nose-thumbing for putting only 44 minutes of music on this disc."
5,Excellent anthropology of sex,"I was fortunate enough to have Dr. Gregersen as a professor when I was an undergraduate. His book provides an excellent introduction to how to think about sexual behavior as an anthropologist, or any scientist, should. The book is informative, easy to read, and well-researched. Highly recommended."
2,"Misleading package, meandering plot","The back of the case for this DVD starts with the following phrase: ""Brotherly love takes a beating in this wickedly funny romance..."" Given this description and the sunshine-filled, happy photos on case, I was expecting this movie to be a relatively tame romantic comedy. They sure fooled me! This movie is a violent drama with little content that I considered to be remotely comedic.That isn't to say I'm rating the movie poorly because of the violence. I do enjoy watching that sort of thing from time to time, but the story behind this film seems to be poorly contrived. It seemed to never end. The characters are played by a number of good actors, and they each perform their roles well, but even they can't fully make up for a mediocre script.Watch this movie if you want. It isn't the worst movie I've ever seen, but there are plenty of better ones. Just don't judge it by the cover like I did. You'll be in for a pretty big surprise if you do."
4,"Not perfect, but still entertaining","I'm not a K. Reeves fan so I was hesitant about seeing the dvd. However I like the other actors and took a chance. I like the interaction between Reeves and Diaz and D'Onofrio. They were able to elevate his performance and make an enjoyable small movie. Sam (D'Onofrio) works as a mob accountant and Freddie(Diaz) who owes them moeny is forced to marry him. On her wedding day she meets Sam's brother jjaks (Reeves) and hooks up with him. There are several twist and turns, but it more a study of some losers and how they ry to work themselves out of dilemmas. Sam is goofy, but he is also unpredictible and violent. jjaks tries to save freddie but he also has some loyalty to his brother. A think plot but at least the characters are original."
4,Twists and Turns,It starts off a little slow but about 3/4 of the way through it gets really interesting.Good preformances.. but who taught Cameron Diaz how to drink a beer?
1,For the love of Pete...,"I suppose everyone is entitled to a ""snafu"" and this is certainly the gaffe-of-the-year for Keanu Reeves and Cameron Diaz.Where to begin: This movie was tedious. And did I mention tedious? I would rather visit the dentist than sit through it again. I haven't felt this bad since ""Bedtime For Bonzo.""The plot: Who knows? Who cares?Generally, it's nice to have a protagonist to root for. There are times, of course, when the characters are gray and I can accept that. You don't always have a ""hero"" or well-defined character who steps up to the plate. But in the case of ""Feeling Minnesota"" the characters are downright murky and you find yourself wondering, ""what's the point?"" If I were living with those characters, I'd be hopping on the next zeppelin or Greyhound bus out of town."
1,Terrible,"I'm not sure why I hated this movie so much, since I've certainly seen- and enjoyed- movies that were much more disturbing. Maybe it was the fact that I felt like I was watching empty shells instead of actual characters- like, some motivation would've been nice. Although, I did miss about forty-five minutes of the movie, since after tolerating as much of it as I could I had to just fast-forward to the end to see what happened, and I have never before not sat through an entire film, which just goes to show how bad this was. The most redeeming aspect was Cameron Diaz, who showed more talent than her role deserved, and an opening sequence that was truly brilliant. Too bad the rest of the film couldn't maintain it. Don't see this movie."
1,This movie is bad.,"One of the worst movies ever created. Even the ""R"" rated version seems chopped-up and the story flows right into the toilet. Absolutely terrible. Don't think about buying or renting this garbage. Diaz is hot, but everyone seems to have forgotten that there is a plot, and that some storyline needs to be conveyed. Think ""The National Lampoon's Vacation"" cast trying to kill each other, only without the wit and script of that movie."
3,"Try to ""feel"" Feeling Minnesota","First of all I agree 100% with Lauren's review. This movie would never be nominated for an oscar so if that's what you are looking for you will be disappointed; however, for what the director/script/actors are trying to achieve, they successfully achieved it. It is kind of a cross between Thelma and Louise and Pulp Fiction. If that doesn't get your curiousity whetted enough to see it..... You will enjoy this movie if you enjoy cool music and have an ""attitude."" Rent it out and test yourself. I personally am buying it."
4,Definately not one of her best....,"This is definately not one of Cameron Diaz's best. In my opinion she ends up being a traitor in this movie. This is not a role that Cameron would normally play. Don't get me wrong, her acting is great as well as Vincent's and Keanu's. I think Keanu was the best one in this movie however. This is about a woman forced to get married...against her will. Then her knight and shining armor comes in, or so you think. Until things go totally awry. Things go a totally different way than what you expect them to, some very unexpected events occur. Despite her role in this movie, it is worth seeing."
1,"worthless American drivel, how bad could it get - pretty bad","The story makes no sense.Acting is horrible by everyone - or, the plot and dialogue just suck so badly that no one could cure it. Having an all star cast raised expectations, then cruelly dashed them.Worst part is that the scenery is not identifiably Minnesota. Even the title raises hopes, only to disappoint.Hopeless American flabby drivel. Sad to see how far Tuesday Weld, Cameron Diaz, and Keanu Reaves had fallen to have to do crap like this for money."
3,Disappointing,"A mostly music compilation that sounds like a creative mixing genius put it together. Saddly, the wedding entrance march is sung in German (I think). Some of the music is a little ""thin"" instead of being ""full bodied"". The wedding exit march will put listeners to sleep. I wish listening samples had been available or I would have saved the money."
1,worst movie ever,I almost took it out of the DVD player and put it in the trash. The only thing stopping me is knowing that I paid money for it. Maybe I'll just leave it at the bus stop and let someone steal it. It got 1 star out of me because I can't put zero.
2,FAMILY REUINON: THE MOVIE,"Family Reunion the movie was not a bad movie in fact some parts of the movie was acctually funny, but the movie could have been better than what it was. I think maybe if Ringworm's character had been more funnier than it would have made a big differnce. I saw this movie last year, and when I bought it I thought that with the cast that Family Reunion had that the movie would be a hit. Well it's just a movie, but I would recommend this movie."
3,It was a cheaply made wholesome movie,"I thought it was ok. I liked the way that ringworm respected his wife it showed what strengthen marriages and binds us to our family, but I have to agree the dialogue and quality are not hollywood."
1,Just plain awful,"You have been warned! Save your money, this movie is just plain awful. The acting is terrible, and the film quality is even worse. It looks as if the movie was filmed over a weekend for a high school film project."
4,Never be left without something pretentious to say again..,"Ever wanted to be one of those know-it-alls at parties with those great haughty insults and witty remarks?Buy this book and never worry again. Definatly a good buy. Fun, Funny, and Educational (?). If you like Oscar Wilde, you'll like this book."
5,Greensleeves!,"This collection is worth hearing and having if only for the extraordinarily hot rendition of the ancient ballad ""Greensleeves"". This one track demonstrates convincingly that bluegrass playing is an approach, not a repertoire. Bravo Mike!"
5,Nice collection of short stories,"I thoroughly enjoyed this collection. You can quibbleabout which authors or stories were omitted, but Ifound it be a very valuable resource in terms of singlesourcing an excellent variety of work. When I wasa ""budding"" writer, short stories were my main sourceof inspirational reading. I learned a lot about point ofview, plot development and character analysis fromsome of the masters of the craft. I also became acquaintedwith scores of new writers seeking to make an impact in thelitery world. I would highly recommend this collectionof short stories"
4,Not experimental but worthwhile,"Kingsolver's introduction is well worth reading (much more thoughtful than Sue Miller's to the newest edition of B.A.S.S.). As always the collection is inconsistent, but there are some real winners: ""Servants of the Map"" by Andrea Barrett is a tour de force of a narrative with enough ideas and subtleties for a short novel; Rick Bass's ""The Fireman"" is heartbreakingly compelling; and a pair of stories about married couples and fertility (Elizabeth Graver's ""The Mourning Door"" and Marisa Silver's ""What I Saw From Where I Stood"") provide insight and feeling into an oft-experienced situation. Some clunker stories, of course, and very little experimental fiction at all, probably not a surprise given that Kingsolver made the choices. One piece of experimentation is ""Boys"" by Rick Moody, a clever but ultimately annoying tale that purports to follow the lives of twin boys but manages to cling to overly familiar stereotypes of male behavior. The collection is worth a read."
4,Not what it appears,"I saw this cd in a magizine with rave reviews, so I listened to it on my computer and, to be honest, wasn't impressed. At first glance, the songs sounded the same and the lyrics weren't important. But for some reason, i listened to it a couple of times and found it grew on me! now, i love this cd and listen to it often!Trust me, the music will grow on you. Each song has its own little twist, from the instrumentation to the style of singing. And the lyrics are very srong, as relized once i read them in the liner notes!!! His voice is perfect for his blues/funk/hip-hop and completly original music. This cd is very different than others and i cant see it being on the radio cause it doesnt have a strong single on it, however, if listened to enough, each song will shine. It is a wonderful cd that gets better every time its played, so give it a good, solid chance!"
5,spectacular,"An unbelievable record. These songs have not left my consciousness for a single moment. Cope shows amazing diversity as well as honesty with this album. The songs seem to tell stories which he is passionate about, and they burrow their way into the soul. Son's Gonna Rise, Sideways, and Fame really stand out with me, but in my opinion there is not a single weak track to be found on this beautiful album."
1,BEWARE - Copy protection limits your listening options,"This CD ""features"" Sunncomm's MediaMax copy protection. They give you the option to listen to poor-quality 128 Kbps files on your computer, if you install Sunncomm's software. These files will not; however, play on your iPod (don't they have like 80% market share for mp3 players?). Sunncomm says they do not support the iPod's copy protection scheme.Also, the CD gave my car CD player ($600 Eclipse deck) fits. Not every time, but frequently enough to be very annoying, it will completely lock up my player. I have to shut off the engine to recover. I think this copy protection will cause some grief with any car player that supports MP3 playback (like mine).I think BMG's decision to include this copy protection will backfire - impacting sales of this disc beyond what piracy would.I am returning this CD...."
2,Merely coping,"2 1/2Although mostly everything on here is sluggish, there is a certain baked consistency, and even a few genuine moments where Cope's multiple musical personalities align inspirationally."
2,Disappointing...Citizen Drink Coaster,"Id love to write a great review but I cant play the CD. Seems my 2 week old computer cant play the CD. This is yet another great reason the recording industry has given us to use p2p sharing.The copy right is so solid the CD wont even play in my cars CD player. Nice job.BTW, Amazon should really put something up in the description about the software that you must download and keep on your machine in order to play this, that is if the software will even work on your computer."
5,"Better than anything else out there,.","I love ""Between a bullet and and a target"" This sound only is 4 stars. I'm glad to fianlly escape the stupid nu-metal and rap that seems to be everywhere. Get this today!"
5,Finally,Finally a kinda unknown album I don't have to give justice to (aka West Indian Girl) Amazing album. This guy is gonna be big. Get him now!
3,He's Baaacccckkk,"With his second album, Citizen Cope comes strong with an 11-track CD. He doesn't cookie-cut his life and his surroundings whatsoever. He transcends from Jazz, Blues, to hip-hop to rock, all mixed to make a classic album. Released the second week of September, the tracks are good if not better than his first. ""Penitentiary"" is one track that you can listen to over and over and understanding why he wrote what he wrote. Other good songs that I recommend are ""Fame"", ""Deep"", ""My Way Home"" and ""Sideways""."
3,"""His first album was better""","This is a pretty good album, but his first one was more innovative. Has anyone listenned to that one? He was on tour with Nelly Furtado in 2002, he openned up for her and I thought his set was even better than hers (although I was there to see her)."
1,Copy Protection Sucks,"I almost bought this album in the store (South Seattle) tonight, but noticed the ""copy protected"" sticker on the front. Glad I did not after reading the feedback here.Sucks a lot -- cause I think the music, from what I've heard (on KEXP, KCRW, and seeing Cope open for Ben Folds a couple of years ago at the Showbox), is first rate -- but alas -- when record companies treat me like a criminal, they are not getting my hard earned cash.Sad that it's decended to this.This disk is available on iTunes, which is a better deal in that at least they have clear use terms -- which is more than I can say from reading the cover of the CD in the store tonight -- unclear what you can and cannot do.I do recommend that Amazon help us consumers out by cleary listing copy protected CD's like this along with clear links to their use policies. This is the kind of information that brings me to Amazon first for purchaes and consumer info."
1,MediaMax Digital Rights Management,"I didn't like the CD, but that's not the reason I give it one star.Buyers beware: This CD is supposedly protected by the MediaMax Digital Rights Management system. This is not stated anywere in the product description.This is more an annoyance than actual protection; but unless you are prepared to figure out an alternative, you will not be able to rip this CD.The MediaMax does provide a means of downloading non-mp3 file copies and sharing. But these files are also protected and unable to convert to mp3."
2,"Different, but unredeeming.","Citzen Cope is a one trick pony and the trick gets old before the CD ends. After the third song, I get what he's trying to do and lose all interest. Lyrics and vocals could save the album, but instead are lazy without point (rhyming by using the same word gets annoying fast on this CD). This style works well on songs of blues, but not every song. He's taken popular, if offbeat musical styles (folk, rap, jazz), put them together and tried to hide a lack of creativity with a dirty musical style."
3,another sell out,"Yes his is the song in the tv commercials for the Pontiac auto. Why do so many musicians so readily compromise themselves and agree to whore their music out to crass commercial interests? True, everyone needs money, most people like money, blah blah. But for music that is supposed to be intensely personal, and communicate directly with a listener, i am only now becoming inured to how easily these ""artists"" become sell outs."
5,Where have you been all my life Citizen Cope?,"Where is this guy's publicist or agent? A great selection of emotional and sensitive lyrics with very simple musicality.A must for artist's of all types, and for people who like an ""unwind"" charm!Thank You for your depth and sincerity Cope."
4,Citizen copee review,"fairly good album, great style of music, bullet and a target classic of course, i also liked pablo piccaso, and penitentary. its a shame u cant get more good music like this in Australia"
5,Absolutely fantastic music,THe Clarnece Greenwood recordings is an excellent CD. The music is soulful. It makes me feel things I can't describe. I highly recommend it. Citizen Cope does not get enough attention that is for sure!Pam Vasquez
1,I had to cope with this CD...,"1 good song on CD, which is the popular Pontiac song...which isn't that good when you listen to the whole song. Pontiac clipped the song to really make you feel like the actual ""Sun"" is going to rise, and your haulin ass- a good drop the top cruise song, but the song is truely about a lady in the back seat-which is his wife, giving birth to their ""SON"". Took the whole feel out of the song and enjoyment away and gave TOTAL different meaning. I can't figure if they are trying to be a hard metal band in some songs, or if they are wanting to be thugs in others. Would not purchase again, definately a 1 hit wonder. Pontiac gave them their 5 minutes of fame."
1,I would never buy this crap,"This guy is opening for Robert Randolph and the Family Band on for their most recent shows. This stuff is crap. I don't know why the hell this guy is opening up for RR. Robert Randolph tears the roof off and this guy puts you to sleep. Couldn't barely make out a word he was singing as his mouth was barely open the whole time. ""Bullet and a Target"" was ok, but ok is the best praise I can give. I think the only redeeming thing about his performance was his keyboard player who is way too good to be playing with this outfit. The drummer was checking his cell phone in the middle of a song and the bassist might as well have not even existed as he was so forgettable. I can't even believe this crap got a record deal. If you are considering buying music from this artist--don't."
4,Oceans of Sorrow....,"First...why is this not listed under Angelo Badalamenti? He composed the whole score and when I searched his name this disk didn't come up... This CD is HEAVY(no, not metal dude). From the opening (odd dark carnival like)till the end this is a deep emotional disk. Very depressing...don't listen too when already down ,because it will drag you lower.Still, it is oddly enchanting and I recommend to anyone who is a fan of Badalamenti's other work(Twin Peaks is a fine example also).Great music...just be careful with it."
5,c'mon its not that bad,"i'm serious i love this album. the set list is nearly flawless. if this album had y.e.m. & mike's song i would call it perfect. true the sound quality is lacking, but it is very listenable. key tracks: tweezer>california love, free, bathtub gin kicks my ass, the moma dance is phish at their phunkiest, and i love trey's playing on birds. folks, just buy it if you love live albums. other live album recommendations: live phish vol. 9, dmband live in chicago, bob dylan bootleg series 4, the dead dick's picks 10, of course the allman brothers fillmore east."
2,John Saul must have peaked......,"Don't read this book if you find topics such as Alzheimer's disease and sexual abuse of children less than entertaining. There is alot of ugliness in this book, not the mystical eeriness that John Saul ususally projects. The plot also moves way too slow. And it's not particularly scary either. Mysterious perhaps, but not frightening. John Saul's earlier works are so much better. I hope this doesn't mean he's losing his creativity."
2,good start but really not good overall,"The story started out really strong and captured my attention, it was mysterious and slightly scary, but about half way through the book Saul got sloppy and repetitive, it was almost as though he had a great idea for a story but didn't know quite how to develop it. And about half way through the book is when Saul's incredibly trite and repetitious writing style started getting on my nerves. He seemed to use the same phrases and metaphors for every character and every plot development. I agree with many of the other reviewers' observations about holes and errors in the plot. It was a great 165 page read, then Saul got lazy and the rest of the book bored me to tears."
4,Fast Read-Surprise Ending,"I just finished reading Nightshade and I really enjoyed it. If you are looking for a Nobel Prize winning piece forget it but if you just feel like reading a fun book, this is it!! Sometimes I don't feel like reading a book with a message, I want to just sit down and relax and read a book that makes me not want to stop reading until I get to the end. You don't want to put this one down because there are so many twists and turns that you have to find out what is going on. Enjoy!!"
4,A littel different from his earlier books,"This is a bit different from his earlier books. Not quite as much supernatural and more psycology is involved. But still a very good book and thrilling read. Even if you get a bit ""irritated"" by some of the characters, you do get the answer in the end. It also makes you think about how important earlier events in a persons life, can cause trouble for later generations. So even if you are not into ghosts, goblins and evil forces, this is one book by this author that you still can enjoy a lot. I recommend this book, even if I liked his early ones, like ""Cry for the strangers"" and ""When the wind blows"" better."
3,Nada new,"When I read the epilogue I was hooked, but then about 1/2 way through the book it started to get repetitive. I just did not care for Matt's character. Still an alright book, but not that ""spooky."" However, it is a quick fast-paced psychological horror w/ a surprise ending. I'd say this book is geared more toward teens/young adults & has the usual troubled teen theme (typical Saul)."
3,"Not a classic, but a classic good read","It seems that when I'm at the library or at an airport bookshop before a trip and can't find a book I really want, I turn to John Saul. Problem is, it seems that many of his books are the same and sometimes I get the feeling as I'm halfway through them that I've read them before.That said, this was a fair book that did keep me turning the pages and make me hope my flight was delayed so I could finish it before I got home. There is enough intrigue and surprises to keep you up at night but also some bizarre plot turns that still leave me wondering.Worth the read, just for the fun."
3,Almost got me.,"With the first chapter the author sets you up for a great read. The story unfolds, however, into an unsatisfying mixed bag of tricks.The characters all take the wrong roads, make the wrong decisions, weaken when they should stand firm, stay silent when they should speak. When they DO speak, their language is stilted and unnatural.The story line, which involves child abuse , paying for past sins and a ghostly haunting held promise but fell short for me with its distracting shortcomings. This book could have been so much more. The ending, like the first chapter, was spellbinding...but I like my thrillers to challenge me a bit, and this one failed to intrigue me."
1,TinaM,"This was the first time reading a John Saul book. I had read a few reviews and it sounded like it would be spooky which I like, however, he did not scare me at all and I kept waiting for it to happen. Did not care much for the characters in this book either. The main female character just kind of drove me crazy, did not like her. Anyway, as I said it was my first time reading Mr. Saul so I probably should not judge too harshly, but I was not impressed or scared."
2,Sorry Johnny,"As a fan of John Saul who has enjoyed a majority of his books over the years, I was a little more than letdown with his current novel, NightShade. I found it to be very dry and rather boring. The plot was easy to see through right from the beginning, and the level of suspense was basically nil in comparison to Saul's previous novels. The ending was extremely disappointing. I don't wanna give it away to those who haven't read the book, but keep this in mind...it was unfair and unfinished, unless John Saul plans to follow NightShade with a sequel perhaps. If you are looking for a novel of suspense and terror, unfortunately you will not find it here. This lastest writing of Saul's is lacking to say the least."
3,Dysfunctional family!,"The Hapgood family seems to have it all--money, social standing, and a loving atmosphere. Underneath the surface, however, are evil forces which begin to pull the family apart. Joan Hapgood's mother, Emily Moore, accidentally burns down her house and so comes to stay with Bill and Joan. Emily has always favored Joan's sister, Cynthia, and she demands a recreation of Cynthia's room in the Hapgood house, even though she has been dead for 16 years. Emily's cruelty towards Joan and her son Matt, and her obsession with Cynthia soon begins to drive a wedge between Bill and Joan. When Bill leaves, things go from bad to worse. There are strange voices and visions, and nothing is as it seems. This book is ""over the edge"" and the author seems to try his best to shock and horrify the reader. For those who enjoy this genre, it may be an interesting book, but it was definitely not my cup of tea!"
3,It's a fun summer read,I am not done reading the book. I am half way. So far it's an OK read. Not up to the stuff he wrote long ago but still a fun summer read. Why not? It's an easy read and not complicated to understand.
3,3 1/2 stars,"A fairly good mystery with a hint of the supernatural. This book reminded me of 'Psycho', with its somewhat odd family and shady history. It was a little predictable and yet it had some surprises. John Saul has written scarier novels but this one had a certain bite to it.""Do what you want to do....Do what you need to do....""Recommended"
2,Trite and predictable,"I decided to read this book after I read Saul's Blackstone Chronicles. I enjoyed the build up in that book, but the ending fell flat. So I got this one thinking I would give him another try. But I was none too impressed with this one, either. It was slow building and not much happened in the first 100 pages. I guessed the identity of the ""evil person"" early on, and guessed about Matt's connnection to Cynthia also. The ending wrapped up too neatly and left you with an unsatisfied feeling. I am going to give him one more chance to impress me ... I hope UNLOVED is good."
1,Wrong item shipped,"For my father's 85th birthday, I wanted to delight him with his favorite dessert, pineapple upside down cake. He received instead chocolate duos. I will not order from this company again. They are unreliable."
2,Bland!,"I've ordered hundreds (maybe thousands) of items from the internet and this is my first review.To put it succinctly, these cakes are bland. We had six different individuals eat these cakes and not one thought they were good. Not much taste and somewhat dry...huge disappointment!"
1,Kingston Micro SD card doesn't work with Motorola SLVR,We purchased 2 1 GB Kingston Micro SD cards from this vendor after checking out compatibility information on the card. When my son tried to use it in his Motorola SLVR it did not work.
5,Well worth the price.,"With the price of memory falling daily, it's hard to know if the price you paid for the memory was low. So the amount that I paid for this memory was, I believe, a good value. I have not had any problems with it and quite happy with it."
4,Good Product Excellent Price!!!!!!!!!,"DOES NOT WORK IN MOTOROLA SLVR L7, from what I have read it's the phones fault. The card seems like it works great in my digital camera. It is so small yet so much memory. Don't buy if you intend to use it in a motorola phone."
2,Kingston 1 GB Micro SD Card (Retail Package),the cards are ok but you send it to me in a huge cage and for that they charge me about $35 that is more than what i paid for the cards so that actually sucked and i don't think i'll buy this type of cards here again!
4,Works OK for me,"I now have several Kingston memory cards, of different types, and they all work fine."
3,Not compatible with Motorola V365,"Despite my Motorola v365 being listed as compatible with this 1GB card , it IS NOT. It cannot be formatted or used in the phone. This was confirmed with my conversation with Kingston tech support. They suggest I buy their 512 mb card instead..and use the 1GB cards for other devices. This after I spent many hours searching reviews and reading technical specs. It not worth returning the three(3) cards I bought and trying another one online."
3,DOESNT WORK WITH MOTO SLVR L7,"the L7 keeps trying to reformat the card, it can't work UNLESS you connect the phone and transfer files via USB.. which take FOREVER!!! all that aside though, it works well enough."
2,Doesn't work with the Samsung SYNC,"I bought this for my wife's Samsung SYNC. Unfortunately it doesn't work. It won't latch into place in the card slot. I tried it in my phone also, still didn't work. The SanDisk 2G micro SD card works great though!"
5,Great and Inexpensive,"This memory card has been great. I bought three 1 GB cards for my and my daughter's LG fusic phones, and my digital camera. The first one was purchased in Dec and has been through a lot of rough treatment and never has failed or showed any signs of corruption. The remaining two purchased in March have worked just as well and even with all of the constant rewriting my daughter does to her card it performs perfectly. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good memory card at a great price."
5,"Awesome deal, awesome card!",I am using this card in my Samsung Blackjack. It works great! No problems at all. What a deal! Bought this 1GB card for $4! The shipping cost more than that. Very pleased. Buy one now. Do it. Bestbuy was $32.
5,Works GREAT!,Kingston always makes a very high quality product! Works flawlessly with my Blackberry and the price was excellent!
5,great little memory,Used micro sd in LG phone. works great. Also used in camera with sd sleeve. works perfectly. Great price.
4,Kingston 1 GB,I received the Micro SD Card sooner than expected. Had an issue with the adaptor not reading the card. I e-mailed them and had another adaptor within a cou[ple of business days. Happy with the quick response. Card now works fine.
1,Do Not purchase for the LG CU500!,I bought two of these for my LG CU500 phones. The phone will not read the cards. From what I hear the only safe bet for the CU500 is the SanDisk.
5,The best is here,I received the kingston Sd card fast. It was just what I wanted and I was very pleased with the speedy delivery.
3,okay,It's good to have this Kingston One GB Micro SD card. They come in handy. I most definely recommend this product.
3,A backup chip,"I hoard storage; hard drives, CD-Rs, MicroSD cards, whatever. This does its job as a 1 GB, portable storage device. I have a couple of these, and have since went for higher capacity chips; on my older devices that don't support the higher capacity chips, however, I use one of the many 1 GB chips I've bought."
5,1 gig is enough,"I got this for my wife's phone. She doesn't take a lot of pictures, but enough to need an sd card. It is easy to install, but you need to be sure to tell your phone to save to it."
5,No complaints,Works great. Increases the capacity of the V3m over the paltry card that comes with it.
2,HippieDippie,"If you like hippie dippie this is your book. Not a simple do-it-yourself, but a simple 1960's hippie sew-it-yourself silly floppy paperback. A remake of the 1971 hardcover. This is a thrift store donation."
2,Don't buy this if you live in the 21st century..,"This book has patterns/guides for clothing styles that are completely outdated. I am a fashionable early twenty-something, and I was repulsed by the crude illustrations for these awful pieces of clothing. There, I said it! Everyone gave great reviews for this book.. don't buy it for someone who is young and up on the current fashion trends."
3,ok but dated,I bought this product hoping to create clothing for my 8 year old step daughter... she's too tall to wear kids' clothes. But the designs in this book are WAY too dated for any modern woman to be interested in. It seems like the instructions are clear and easy to understand but the final product is not something that I would wear.
3,Advanced Sewer,"Book was in the condition described. However, something seem to be missing. I'm an advancer sewer and this book didn't quie do it for me."
3,propaganda about propaganda,"For what it's worth I do agree with what the film-makers of ""Grass"" have to say... that our government's criminilization of marijuana is a far greater crime than all the use, dealing, and growing of it combined and multiplied. But the film would have been better if it had been a little more even handed in it's approach. This film isn't gonna change many people's minds on the issue of legalization. I also think that this film could have gone further than simply attacking the government propaganda over the years. It is affective as a compilation of ridiculous propaganda (at times you'd swear the people who made these things were trying to be funny). But it doesn't tackle key issues like the competition that hemp provides to the paper and cotton industries, which could arguably be the main motivation behind the millions and millions of dollars wasted on this ""war""."
3,Grass review,"I viewed something on you tube that was better and nothing like what i bought. It was new and inspiring, what i have bought is just Ok..."
4,Great film on GANJA,"This is a great funny movie about the lost ""war on drugs"", and show how stupid and hipocrit is the prohibition of Marijuana in the States and consequently elsewhere."
5,"Grass is more than funny, it's TRUE","Grass is a documentary about the anti-marijuana legislation going back to the early twenties, narrated by who else - Woody Harrilson. It is funny and well organized, a must see! =)"
5,Quantum Leap The Complete Fifth Season,"I LOVE Quantum Leap!!! Love Scott Bakula and Dean Stockwell, they are terrific. I DON'T like how Donald Belasarius ended the series! I would love to see a Quantum Leap movie and end it the way all Leap fans want it to end! With Dr. Samuel Beckett being able to leap home at will! I now have my entire Quantum Leap collection completed! YEA!!!!"
3,Por qué no está con subtitulos en español,"Las cuatro anteriores temporadas contenían subtitulos en español, pero esta no, ¿por qué?"
2,Disappointed,I was disapointed with this purchase as I was ripped off only getting half of the DVD's that should have been in the pack. Which meant I didn't get the episode that I particularly wanted which was the final episode.
4,Great TV,I liked the show and it had some very good episodes in it. When I go and watch it again I learn something new.
5,Fast,This product is going to be given as a gift. Arrived in great condition and arrived very quickly. Nothing bad to say except no inserts. But that's no big deal for great quality DVDs.
4,Needs extras and scene selections,"The stories are as good as ever, but they really rushed this one out. It has almost no extras and even lacks scene selections. They could have waited a bit longer and done a better job with this set."
3,Quantum Leap - The complete fifth season,This is the most awsome program that was ever put on TV and the complete fifth season which I received was just wonderful with all the extras and the clarity was great. I have no problems at all when I received it and it arrived in a very short time. I will continue to get my movies from amazon.com
3,Not as good as previous seasons too dark,"I absolutely love Quantum Leap, but thought this last season the writers went too far to the dark side writing about a lot of evil and dark stories. The show had a lot of good substance prior to that, why change or why fix something that ain't broken? It was almost as if the writers were trying to reach a different audience, younger maybe, instead of those that fell in love with the first 4 seasons, to bad too, it was a really great show and didn't need all the ""horror and evil"" spelled out in the last season. Who knows, maybe they got tired of writing good quality, spell-binding stuff."
3,THE MUSIC!!,"Ladies and Gentlemen, take my advice... go to amazon.co.uk and order the British releases of these DVDs, if you have a player that will support them. They use the ORIGINAL music, not the stuff on the DVDs released in the U.S. Also, if you do the conversion, they cost the same if not less even with shipping. Please also do not order the British complete package, as you cannot play the final episode, according to several posters. Get each season separately. It adds up to about the same. I live in VA and it was only 12 GBP to ship all five seasons. Well worth it, if you want the series the way it was intended. My two cents..."
3,An enjoyable way to spend an evening,"My husband loved this series while it was still on the air, though I never watched it. Years later, when it was first released in CD format, I bought it for him and ended up sitting down to watch with him. I was surprised by just how enjoyable and well done it was. Dean Stockwell and Scott Bakula were a wonderful team, the writing was usually very good, and there are so many ""cameo"" performances by actors who later went on to bigger, better things; fun to see them in their early carreers. Each episode does stand alone, but there is an overall story arch that I found actually gripping (especially related to Al's time in Vietnam and as a POW)."
4,"Great, but not one through four","We have the first four seasons and obviously if you have four...you gotta' make the series complete. The acting is, as you'd expect, on par with the first four seasons, but some of the story lines were a bit weak.Loved this show, but season five WAS a good place to end it...though Al's ending seemed appropiate, Sam's ending was---What??But hey, it's just a TV show."
2,must have disc in to play,"Games are ok. The downside is that you must have the disc in to play. You cannot load it then leave the disc behind. This is a pain when you want to load it on a laptop and then take the laptop on trips, you have to lug the disc around too."
3,The Only One With PENTE.,"I bought this one- because it's the only one I found that includes the game PENTE(that I know of)- my favorite. The Pente and Parcheesi game graphics are well designed, can't say the same for the others(Chess, Checkers, Backgammon, Connect Four, Dominoes)- not much thought in the graphics(the backgammon board has ""scribble"" marks on the surface(artistic?). OK opponents/personalities to chose from. Note that it's designed for Windows 95/98(a bit dated), but it will play on Windows XP with some slight distortion of the screen(stretched). Also, you have to insert the CD every time you play(won't run without it)- which is a bummer. On a scale of 1-10 I give it a 5."
4,game disk,I liked the board games on the disk. They were fun to play. I recommend this game to anyone aged teen to adult.
1,Terrible,Total waste of money--backgammon game not playable--screen turns almost totally black when try to begin playing. i would return it but do not want the extra expense of shipping. Have since purchased a Kindle backgammon game for $1.99 and am totally satisfied with that.
1,Written by a guy with the same name as my father-Stephen J. Zipko,"This guy has the same name as my dad so we thought wed buy it for kicks. it is BORING, MAKES NO SENSE, AND IS IRRELEVENT TO ANYTHING TOXIC RELATED. DO NOT BUT THIS BOOK!!!!!!!! DO YOU HEAR ME? DONT BUT IT!"
4,Goodbye to All That,This book is the edited version by the author of his book that is mainly about his experiences during WWI. It gives a very personal account of that time and is well written. I would have liked to have read his original account instead of this edited version by him. I enjoyed this book as it is a version of not only WWI but a world that no longer exists. It is a part of history that has helped to shape our world of today. So in a way we have not said goodbye to all that.
3,Curiously lacking,"Unfortunatly, I have to disagree with most of the other reviewers. As suggested in the title I found ""Goodbye to all that"" curiously unsatisfying. Maybe this is the case because I read the edited edition which gives the 1929, the 1959 edition and comments by Grave's contemporaries. Again and again these comments correct Graves who freely admited of fictionalizing events so as to make the book more interesting and to get more money out of the whole business. If he wanted to write a fictional account he clearly should not have called the book ""an autobiography""! This deeply angered fellow war-writers such as Sassoon, who also accused Graves of overplaying his role in getting Sassoon a medical board. With this background the book looses much of its fascination. Rather contemptible is also Grave's treatment of the colonial troops which shows a good deal of racism."
3,Goodbye to Graves Books,"Good descriptive text of WWI in the trenches and on the way to them, but other than that, not a particularly well-written book. Graves's 'better than thou' attitude sours what could have been a masterpiece if written by somebody with a heart. A bitter story by a bitter man who should have stuck to his poetry."
3,Good-Bye to all That,"The beginning of the book was slow as it covered his school years prior to the war, the middle of the book was exciting with the war stories and the end of the book was slow covering his life after the war. The portion of the book that covered the war was very insightful."
3,Not the original edition!,"Based on the description I thought this was the original 1929 text but, unfortunately, it turned out to be the heavily revised 1958 version. Very likely still a great read (this book was to be a gift and I've not read it myself) but not the edition I was after."
4,An Accurate and Entertaining View on an English Soldier's Perspective During the First World War,"The first half of the book is rather dry, yet don't let it hold you back! The second half of the book deals with his actual involvement with the war, as opposed to his education and prior background. The book is somewhat of a love story as well as a view on war, but his depictions of events are quite honest and astutely accurate. His views are quite contrasted with Ernst Junger, who wrote ""Storm of Steel"" and was a German soldier. However, for an English perspective, this is the best book by far that I have encountered!"
2,"Pay Attention to the Editions, There Were Three","There are three editions of this Robert Graves Classic: ""Goodbye to All That"". Get the first or the third. The first came out in the 20s and was raw and popular. The second came out in the 50s and was somewhat bowdlerized by the author, because several of the people involved were still alive. His son oversaw a third edition in the 90s which explained some of the reasons for the changed second edition and restored some of the original material. If you pay attention to details, find out which edition you are getting. I have downrated this edition because it is the second. I purchased a third edition off of Amazon about a year ago but I haven't seen it available since and I'm still looking.If this is too nitpicky for you, the second edition is still very good, it is missing some interesting material however."
2,Text Too Small,"I purchased this book used but in very good shape and I fully expect I will enjoy the work once I find a different edition with larger text. Even now I am back on Amazon Books trying to get an inside glimpse of other editions. It simply is too difficult to read and having just had very successful cataract surgery, I'll be darned if I'm going to put on magnifiers again. So there it sits. With larger type I fully expect to come back and give a 5-star review, but not at this time. It's also a book I would have preferred to get on my Kindle but that too 'remains to be seen'."
4,Works great!,"I looked all over the internet and in local stores for this, and finally decided on this one. I keep it on our back porch and it does a great job of removing mud from our shoes. I rate it 4 stars instead of 5 only because I wish the metal scraper was a little taller to get our shoes really clean. Otherwise, excellent product!"
5,Get this if you hate mud in the house!,"Our rural community has dirt roads, and of course our driveway is too. We love to walk, but hate the inevitable mud that gets caked on our shoes. This has metal flanges on each side, so you can step on it and hold it in place with one foot while you scrape the mud off the other foot between the securely mounted stiff brushes. The company sells replacement brushes for when the original ones wear out, and all of it is US made, a plus in my mind. A great product that does the job. Now, if only we could get our Dalmatian to wipe her paws in this!"
4,"Mighty Bop, The - The Mighty Bop","On their self-titled album, The Mighty Bop emerge from the darker recesses of jazz into the sun, going for bright and peppy rhythms and melodies. The track ""Sunshine Magic"" pretty much explains it all. ""Too Deep"" goes for St. Germain-style jazz house, while ""Tell Me"" is a Burt Bacharach track exported to France. Though their new uptempo direction is done with quality and care, it sounds a little too familiar to that entire genre. ""Summer Session,"" for instance, sounds as if it could have been done by anyone at all. But ""I Go Crazy"" shows its own personality, an ompah-jazz track perfectly suited for cabaret singers around the world, and ""On the Moon"" is a seaside vacation on a lunar beach. It's a good way to end an album."
4,Really good reading,"This book supplies the reader with important information regarding the false doctrines of the Seventh-Day Adventist, Mormons, and Jehovahs Witness. The chapters on 'Faith' and the 'Indwelling of the Holy Spirit' are excellent studies. I have studied through this book twice."
3,TRUTHFUL Review,"DID NOT COMPLETE THE BOOK. BUT WHAT I DID READ OF IT, WAS VERY INFORMATIVE, AND ADIFFERENT OUTLOOK ON BELIEFS OF MANKIND.SINCERE TRUTHFUL"
5,The fear of a child,"In this forceful and disturbing novel, a woman discovers slowly the real (psychic) reason of her illness: an irresistible continuing loss of blood.During her psychoanalysis, she succeeds in demolishing the thick wall that separates her from the extremely painful truth and the origin of her disorder: the fear of a child. The story unveils masterly the reasons of this fear.Marie Cardinal evocates fiercely her violent psychic battle with her unconscious in order to force it to reveal its secrets, her fear to (re)discover forgotten painful, but crucial, incidents or the psychic violence needed to open the doors of the subconscious.Her book is also a profound meditation on the impact of a `colossal' religion on people's lives (interdiction of divorce) and on the female condition and female psychology.A formidable and shocking book.A must read."
3,Good till the cord gives out,Purchased this item for like $10 and for the money it sounds fine and I never had problems with either the fit or mic as stated in other reviews. My issue was after prolonged use 10-12 months the cord where it joins the plug broke and the connection became intermittent. Time to buy a new one.
2,Um ow.....,I bought this based on the good reviews...funny all the reviews dissapeard along with my first review. Let me say the sound quality is great I can hear everything on the other end. Sadly they can't hear me very well! Even though it comes with different sized ear parts none of them feel well after about 30 minutes of talking on the phone. You have to adjust it over and over. When you finally get it comfortable it the mic is up by your eyes. That would be great if I talked through my eyes but I don't. After 30 minutes the pain starts. It doesn't feel good at all. After an hour you might as well be getting your brain drilled into. I won't even get into what happens if you accidentally drop your phone while wearing this headset I doubt amazon will aprove the words...
1,microphone doesn't work well,"Comfortable enough, and I can hear the other person fine, but they have difficulty hearing me. Poor microphone."
1,Complete waste of money,"This headset lasted less than 4 months. It showed no signs of wear - the audible portion just stopped working. Panasonic warranties it for 90 days only so it was a complete waste of money, I strongly recommend against this product."
3,Good sound quality but not comfortable,"I liked the sound quality but was dissappointed by fit and function. I wish there was a call release/answer button. It has a mute button, but I don't really use this. I could get over this shortcoming if the headset wasn't so uncomfortable! I can't seem to adjust it to get a good fit. The platic boom is rigid and doesn't line up with my mouth. The headset feels like it's going to fall off all the time too... Oh well, serves it's purpose. Three stars."
5,Panasonic KX-TCA94B Hands-Free Headset,"Loved this hands-free headset. Quality of sound is great and friends say they can't even tell I'm using it. What a neck saver for me. I can move around, do everyday things and still talk easily on the phone. Would definitely buy it again and again!!"
1,Very Disappointing,This is a very disappointing album. The songs sounded like works in progress and/or poorly recorded. The last song was the worst. His voice gives out completely in it. I could not detect any Lucinda inspired licks on it. One of the worst CDs I have ever heard. One star is too much.
3,Very Different Book,This was a book that I really enjoyed because it took me through the ups and downs of Tyler Blake's life. I was drawn into the book because the back cover stated that the story was loosely based on the author's real life. It was an honest & believable read.Tyler had to go through so much in order to realize her self worth. The best part about this book was the fact that there were a lot of pointers spread out throughout the book that were great take-home messages for the reader. I'm very glad that I took the time to sit down and read this book.
5,Learned Behavior,"So pretty in pink , was oh so blue......... Joy told a wonderful story of how when something is embedded in you, that's how you view life, if you are never expose to what's really real. Joy's mother did a terrible job of raising her daughter's both were good girl's they just wanted to be love in the proper way. Joy did overcome her obstacles without her mother help, So pretty is good read for someone who is in a allround abusive relationship, Tyler Blake gives you some good Sidebar's on the subject,also a good read for Young teenage girls who thinks that life is about what a man can do for you it's not so pretty in Pink."
5,loved it,Sara Douglass is a wonderful writter I am so glad I found her. I just finished the Dark Glass Mountian series WOW
5,Satisfying!!,"An extremely satisfying story, all three books. Once you pick up the first ya just cant stop!! I really loved her perception and creativity (and how the darn humans are so egoistic!!). Quite a story! Enjoy , I sure did!"
2,Not as good as expected,"I read Sara Douglass' latest series, 'the Crucible Trilogy' (not yet available ...for some reason) and was absolutely enthralled. It's fascinating and steeped in history which is great. As a result, I eagerly bought the Axis Trilogy and I was really disappointed.They lack the zing, originalty and fine writing of the Crucible Trilogy. She is undoubtedly a fine fantasy writer and I look forward to her next offerings."
5,The apex of the genre.,"While I regard this genre as my guilty little secret, an escape from the demand of more ""serious"" literature, I truly love it. Up until now however, I have felt like this genre was missing something, that it all had been said and done and that it was tiring out. This series opened my eyes to the fathomless possibilities that still exist. I now know that I can come away from a series fully satisfied and yet, somehow aching for more. Lately some bright lights have appeared in this genre, and I would have to consider Sara Douglass as one of the best. If you like epic fantasy I would recommend this series heartily. I look forward to once again slipping into her rich world with the release of the next trilogy in the States."
1,The sorry ending,This started out as a good story. With great set of characters everyone had there role. So what happened to this great warrior Axis. He went from hero to zero in a matter of pages. The main character in this series started out as the greatest of warriors and then took to the side lines while the women won the day. So then what happened to the prophecy it killed me to have paid for this book and to have waited for this sorry ending to a pretty good story. Don't waste your money just read the last thirty pages of this book in the store.
4,"not the best, but not bad either","this book was pretty good. i wouldnt recomend it to everyone, but i know of a few people who would just love it.i give this book 3.5 stars. the reason lies mostly in the oddities of the characters. i could explain them all, but that would just be a waste of time.i myself liked the ending, and wolfstar was a great character, but other than that it wasnt much. o, i still liked it,and will probably buy it when it comes out in paper-back, but like i said, this book isnt the best. good reading and enjoy."
1,SO glad it's over.... but it's not,"I review SFF for a series of college publications, and so am forced to finish trilogies and series that I thought stunk from the beginning. While some [and I stress the word SOME] of the ideas in thie series have interesting beginnings, the writing is so bad, and the characters so genuinely unlikeable, that it is hard to give a good damn what happens to any of them. The names are childish in their sound, and the silly prophecy which they are following has no interesting twists to the outcome, so it was basically as dumb at the end as it was at the beginning. Sarah Douglass is a mediocre writer, fine for producing potboilers like this, but otherwise not worthy of note."
1,Dumb from beginning to end,"The art on the cover of the American versions of these books is wonderful.There. That's the one nice thing I can say about Sara Douglass's books.I am amazed at the popularity there seems to be associated with this tripe. The writing is awful, the plotline is predictable and stupid, and the characters are dull. Avoid this, unless you like reading the stuff that gives fantasy a bad name in the first place."
1,What was Sara thinking??? Spoilers ahead !,"The first book in the series isn't bad..in fact I loved it. However, by the third book Sara has destroyed the one character who you have bonded with from the very beginning....Faraday, the heroine. It seemes as through while writing the trilogy, the author thought to herself ""Hey, Faraday is just not the heroine I wanted when I started the series...Let's add another woman who can take over,"" which is the case in the second book. Faraday becomes a second rate female character whose actions mirror that of a slave's. I know there are three more books after this and that Faraday comes back a bitter woman...well wouldn't you be too? But that fact alone does not save Starman from turning out to be the worst book in Douglass's career. In fact, after Starman I swore to myself that I would never buy another Sara Douglass book. If I could've given this a review a negative star I would have./rant off"
3,Doesn't anyone feel bad for Faraday?!,"I really did not like Axis. He betrayed Faraday, and didn't take responsiblity for it. He was really lucky that she decided Tendesor was worth her sacrifice, because Axis definitely wasn't. He was soooooooo stupid. I don't understand how both Azhure and Faraday fell in love with him. Also, I thought Azhure became too powerful too quickly. They defeated the Skraelings and Gryphons way too easily.I think that Faraday desearves more recognition for what she did. She suffered a lot more than Azhure did, and got a lot less. I think most people in her position would hate Axis, and try to make him suffer. I really wanted him to lose to Gorgrael after being such a [jerk] to her."
1,"Started so well, ended so poorly.","The first book in the series created a wonderful fantasy world and characters that you could care about and love.In Enchanter and on into Starman, Sara spends her time destroying the characters you have come to care about and leaves you cheering for Gorgrael as everyone else, except possibly Faraday, have degenerated into vile individuals with little or no redeeming qualities. This leaves the reader with little desire to read on and no emotional attachment to the characters other then general disgust.I am an avid fantasy fan and can forgive a great deal but Sara's own assassination of her characters makes this by far the poorest fantasy series I have read. I dont normally write reviews of the many fantasy books I read (and mostly love) but the last two books in this series were so bad it made me throw them out in hopes I might spare someone the misfortune of picking them up."
1,It's getting a bit too stupid,"The first two books, while not great literature, were entertaining enough. The 3rd story takes a turn towards ludicrious. Some of the ""it's so dumb I can't take it any more"" points:- Two of the main characters turn into gods or immortals. Axis literally cannot die, but can be killed by his brother.- The prophecy tells you everything you need to know about the series.- A newborn baby plots, 2nd male in line for the throne, to get his brother kidnapped, so he can be named hier. The baby has a woman carry him around to carry out the plot.- The bridge guardian that challenges everyone can be fooled by saying ""trust me"", and it's a female guardian no less ;-)- Faraday and Azhure fight off a god by holding on and telling him to go.- You know the outcome of every battle before the author writes it which leaves no suspence.I didn't know the author intended the series to be a comedy."
2,"Lazy, lazy author","Wow. Sara Douglass apparently missed the lesson in writing class that taught that synonyms are your friends. She really liked the word ""cuddled,"" for some reason. People never hugged, babies were rarely cradled, and bodies were seldom pressed against each other. Also, she seemed unable to think of many other epithets besides ""b^tch."" I don't really have a problem with it being used to make the characters realistic or whatever, but it's just annoying when it's used as often as it is in this book. I felt like it was on practically every page during some sections, like the whole Smyrton and Artor battle section, and everywhere around Caelum's kidnapping. It constituted 90% of the insults hurled by Douglass's men against her women... which strikes me as sheer laziness on Douglass's part."
4,Review of Starman,"Faraday came into her own in this book. I was really pleased with the strength of character she showed throughout the story - and the only small disappointment I had about her was her martyr-like tendencies. But overall, well done to Sara Douglass for taking a very weak character and making her strong.There were just a few surprises in this book, but they weren't all that large of surprises. The battle scenes were well done. The most heart-breaking portion of the story was the relationship between DragonStar and his parents.With this book the first trilogy ends and I think I'll take a bit of a break before reading the next three. Overall though, a great series."
3,Kills the time,"Passes the time but isn't any sort of ground breaking work. If you don't have a lot of time don't waste it here, but if you devour fantasy give it a try."
4,Awesome!,"This game is just great. The sounds are good, and the graphics are too. Some levels are too hard, though. I can't beat the Shelob part. Also, when you walk, you suddenly kind of change your view, which confuses people a lot until you get to understand all of that. They should have more blood in there, and more character levels. They should have more upgrades also..."
4,All is fine in Middle Earth,"Based on the upcoming movie on J.R.R Tolkien's literary masterpiece this game truly shows players what it's like to assume the roal of Aragorn, Frodo, or Gandalf. awesome enimies and sweet bosses make this game so fun. although do to the online benifit of the PS2 version I would get that instead. FUn"
5,Amazing Game!!!,"This game is fantastic!! Serious WOW factor!! Whether you enjoy the movies or not-this game is a must have! If you like the movies you will go crazy. As you can tell I am throughly enjoying this game and so is my wife. I am always looking for 2 player co-op games and this is the ultimate! The cut scenes and awesome and the unlockable added features ie. interviews and concept art are a great addition. There is nothing more exciting then kicking the crap out of a bunch of orcs. Its not just button mashing as you gain more exp points by better, more difficult kills. You get to use all the characters from the book/movie, and a few unlockable ones too.Graphics: 100/100Sound, sound effects: 100/100Gameplay: 100/100Ease of use: 100/100Difficulty: I'm only 25% and I have had to restart a few missions, so I guess its moderately hard.Fun factor: 100/100This game is so good I do not feel its necessary to give a more detailed description...IT'S A MUST HAVE!"
4,TO MUCH FIGHTING.,fighting! oh my god there is so much fighting! it is not at all like the first two. AND! you have to sit through about thirty minutes of movie time before the game even starts! then there is a series of like impposible levels
4,Great But Difficult Game,"The music, graphics, game play are the best yet. However, the missions can be very tough even on normal setting, with hard being suicide. It says on the back of the game ""Live the Movie, Be The Hero"" is so correct. Its just like playing the movie with the build up to the actual level using movie clips is outstanding and gets the pulse up. Many hours of game play much of which will be playing the same level over and over trying to figure out your next move but well worth the time if your a LOFTR fan and gamer........"
5,The Lord of the Rings the Return of the King,"This game is the one for hardcore lotr fans! It has absulutelybrilliant graphics and super cool extras like Hobbits on Gaming, a session of where the actors who play the hobbits talk about their skills in gameplay. There are nine cool characters, and special paths. For example, the path of the wizard is Gandlf,the path of the man is Legolas, Aragorn, and Gimli. the path of the hobbits is Sam and Frodo. There are also three hidden characters.Overall, this beautiful game deserves 5 stars."
4,THE ABSOLUTE BEST GAME,"This is the best game for Tolkien fans and non Tolkien fans. When I got the game I plopped down on my couch and was absolutely stunned by the gameplay and graphics. The levers are not too easy and not too hard. This is just PERFECT.Gameplay- 10/10, the controls are easy to do and has nice combos and levels.Sound- 10/10, the sound totally takes you by surprise. It really helps the gameplay.Levels- 10/10, the levels are really fun and just the right difficulty.Graphics- 10/10, this game has totally WICKED graphics. They're like the best part of the game.Overall- 10/10"
4,One of my favorites!!,"I fell in love with this game the first time I played it. The graphics and the sounds are incredible. The gameplay if fun. It keeps you interested especially since they have three different paths to follow, as well as several different players you can do it with. I play it with my son so having it play in co-op mode is a HUGE benefit and source of enjoyment.My only gripe is that if you are playing by yourself, it is sometimes hard to build up a player. Locking the game behind you as you progress is really disappointing.Other than that, fantastic!!!! Highly recommended. A huge improvement over the Two Towers game. I love this game!!"
4,Gave this as a gift and the kids still play them all the time,Gave this as a gift and the kids still play them all the time. Im not a huge console game fan (I'm more of a PC FPS player) but my nephews love these and said to rate them four stars! I gave them the whole LOTR set along with the Hobbit.
4,MUCH MORE FUN THAN THE TWO TOWERS!,"As the title said, this action-packed thrill-ride is much more fun than The Two Towers! Don't get me wrong, I own and LOVE the Two Towers, but this game is superb! Plus, it isn't as easy as TTT, it's much more challenging! Youd should definitely PICK UP THIS TITLE!!!!"
2,Good game...... but.........,"The Lord of thr Rings the Return of the King video game is a good game, but it has one problem.... the checkpoints are to far appart! Way to far apart! It is really anoying because I spent about one hour playing the game. I was doing really good but then I had to face this cave troll, unfortunatly it had alot of armor so it was hard to kill. So then I died and I went all the way back to my last checkpoint, and quess what, I got that chectpoint about one hour before I died so it was like that entire hour never happened. So I sugest you never get this game. Of course you can use the game for nice firewood. Yeah thats it the game will make exillent firewood. If you want a good game I sugest Metal Arms, Halo, Halo 2 (when it comes out), or PGR2 (Project Gothem Racing 2). Any of those games are fine, but don't get The Return of the King video game unless you want good firewood."
2,Isn't this the same?,"One question? Isn't this the same game as the two towers. Besides the fact that there of course different missions and different characters, its practitally the same game as before.Pros:Good graphicsGood musicLots of charactersFun missionsCons:ITS THE SAME GAME AS TWO TOWERS.THE SAME POINT AS TWO TOWERS.PRACTICALLY THE SAME MOVES AS TWO TOWERS.SAME MUSIC AS TWO TOWERS. (I still like it though)THE LAST BOSS FIGHT WITH GOLEM SUCKS!Overall, this game...is fun, but the the exact same as before."
3,A golden turd is still a turd,"(...) This is an okay game as a matter of gameplay, (way too easy and way too short) but the graphics were horrible. The views made me want to puke. The visuals were way worse than the two towers game (which was way easy) but I actually enjoy. One thing- I LOVE GAMING BUT I ONLY PLAY TWO HOURS A WEEK- SERIOUSLY. THE FIRST TIME I PLAYED A VIDEO GAME WAS IN EARLY 2002. OMY GOD. GIVE ME A BREAK- THEY SHOULDN'T EVEN HAVE CHECKPOINTS THIS IS SOOO FRIGGIN EASY! BUY NINJA GAIDEN THE BEST GAME WITH HALO AND SOUL CALIBUR 2 (EASY AS HELL, BUT GREAT VS BATTLES)- HELL YEAH!"
1,easiest game ever,this game is so easy I beat it right when i got it.the graphics are ok but my Aragorn is level 11 and now he is useless i mean whats the point of buying an upgrade to someone that is level 11.legolas is level 1 and when i beat a long level with him he got to level 4.do not buy it you can rent it and on saturday or sunday you will beat the game.and also the last level the crack of doom you have to make gollum fall like over 10 times well don't buy it thats all i have to say
4,tight game!,this game is awsome!!! it has really good graphics and awsome special effects! there is one con though....you cannot rotate views so sometimes your looking at ur self running toward the screen.other than that this game is literally awsome!
3,cant hang with the two towers game,"this game unlike its predecessers has more than 3 options of who to be.frodo and the hobbitts can come too.and some others.the graphics are old school and so is the game play.a great deal of team work is required to beat this one.i dont really recall the scenes in this video game being in the lord of the rings movie trilogy either.maybe they were.this game just lacks some of the pizazz of the two towers video game.i beat it simply because i beat the first two already.now i know i am talking bad on it,but for any dedicated lord of the rings fan,it is a must!its a good game,there are just better out there.oh and for all you guys who think lotr is the best movie set ever.......STAR WARS F'N RULES!"
5,yayaya,It works fantastic and I appreciate it sooooo much! It is so much fun and its a great thing to play with friends
2,stick to your style of movies spike..,"I love Spike Lee and have supported his artistic endeavors since ""She's gotta have it"", but come on, Inside Man was purely ""Corny"".I know the man has talent and wanted to show Americans that he could switch it up. The film had a good plot,but unfortunately it was too spotty. The scenes were weak,the acting was weak and that music..why Terrance Blanchard for a ""heist"" movie? Sorry Denzel,not your best look.I Did'nt like this film."
2,Nothing short of AVERAGE...,"Show me a movie where Denzel Washington is bad? He always puts forth a powerhouse showing in any role, and Inside Man is no different.If is just that the movie as a whole felt really long, which comes as a suprise to me, considering I sat and watched the Lord of the Rings (all three) without ever looking at my watch. And all those movies are about walking around outside, while Inside Man is well walking around in a bank.I as a movie-goer find myself looking back at the already produced movies to find that a majority of those today, lack any plot. Which I can say is the story here. I could stick this movie in the same stack of Jurassic Park 3. Kid gets lost, parents go to island to find kid, everyone leaves. Thats essentially what I am seeing here...Maybe it is one of those movies you have to rewatch to appreciate, but if I look at my watch another time during this flick it's to the bargin bin with this one."
4,a nice heist picture,"Master director Spike Lee (who for some reason gets completely ignored by the oscars) is back at it again - this time with a seemless suspense film.Denzel is great as always, and the supporting cast is marvelous.. This is not even close to being one of Spike's best, it is a little too reminiscent of other classic noir thrillers, but it is done with a masterful touch - not to be missed.."
3,The Unusual Suspects?,"Despite a capable cast and a clever premise, ""Inside Man"" didn't quite work for me. Like ""The Usual Suspects"" (a far better movie, IMHO) ""Inside Man' relies on a chopped-up timeline and after-the-fact interviews to divert your attention from the fact that, basically, the story it tells isn't really very plausible. How does the leader of the ""robbers"" know about the damning evidence in the safe deposit box? How does Case know that THEY know? And aren't we past the time when former Nazi collaborators make convincing villains? Case must be at least 85! When do we stop? When they're 100, or 110? Get some new bad guys, Hollywood! 3.5 stars."
1,inside man,"What a disaster! I bought the movies and I was not able to download/see them via my dutch computer!! Please advise what to do, I did buy the movies..."
2,How to review a movie I didn't even watch...,"INSIDE MAN - Russian menus, audio in Russian or English, subtitles in Chinese or ChineseAnd you guessed it. I'm still watching DVDs we brought from China. This one, for example, stars Denzel Washington and Jodiet Foster.I have no reason to doubt it is as advertised, but I only lasted 15 minutes. The English audio was a bit distorted, no subtitles, and I'm sorry to report that Mr Washington developed a case of high-speed mumbles here. And, after all, it is only a bank hostage movie. Hard to care. Sorry folks."
3,Not Widescreen!,"I realize the product details mention this is the fullscreen (4:3) version of the movie, but I'm not accustomed to checking those details before I order DVDs since it's usually mentioned in the product title. Don't buy this version if you want to watch it in its native, widescreen format!"
3,"Good Cast, Nice to Watch",This movie has a good cast and it could have had a really good plot but unfortunately the plot does not live up to the cast's potential.Things go from hmmm to huh? really quick.It is still an entertaining movie but don't expect to be dazzled.
4,well paced action drama,Well acted characters in the roles that they inhabit frequently and comfortably. Not breaking any new ground but skillfully executed.
3,Spike hits a home run,"This film proven to be a hit at the box office for filmmaker Spike Lee. I usually avoid his films like the plague since I've grown tired of his preaching on race and the ills of this country but for once, he has delivered a solid, entertaining movie. The cast, for starters, is excellent. Denzil Washington, Clive Owen, Jodie Foster, Willem Dafoe, Christopher Plummer & Chiwetel Ejiotor really deliver the goods in this slick heist movie. Seemingly a heist film, this film is more than that and thank god, Lee steers away from his political preaching. If you've avoided his films in the past, do check this one out--you'll probably like it."
3,"Not bad, not great...but Good!","A strong three stars. Because it kept me interested. Mr. Washington is slightly more cocky as the lead detective than necessary. I suspect because the role was less demanding than awkward for him, or perhaps I've got that backward. And I really can't say what Ms. Foster was doing as her role was limited, however, played to the hilt - sort of like an operatic voice singing blues. Clive Owen really brings it off. And Christopher Plummer - did these greats owe something to someone. But, more than anything - it's the story, and what Mr. Lee didn't do to it. Fast paced, well thought out, the inevitable twist, and an excellent ending."
5,Clive Can Rob Me Anytime At Work,"I simply adored this movie and I watched it over 7 times!!! I now own the DVD and various movie items. Clive was perfect for this role and he was born to be bad!!!! Not real sure about Jodie's part, was that necessary? Denzel is always fabulous! Well written and awesome story line. This is one of Clive's and Spike's BEST movies!!!!I work for a bank, and my subject line was because I would love for Clive to come visit me at work!!!!!"
3,Heist movie with clever twists...but little else,"The 3-star reviews have it right for me. Short summary: fascinating bank heist with some unusual and very clever twists, Denzel is terrific, Jodie Foster's role is unnecessary, Christopher Plummer is oddly one-dimensional, Willem Dafoe is strong but in a small role, a couple of the bonus deleted scenes shouldn't have been deleted, and the plot holes are indeed several and large. Suggest renting rather than purchase; it is good to watch once if you're a Denzel fan as I am, but know that you will most likely not repeat the experience."
4,A smartly written thriller gets a strong technical release,"I hadn't seen this movie in theaters, but was pleasantly surprised by the story. This is not a typical heist / bankrobber movie but adds a few interesting elements to the mix. Strong performances of Jodie Foster, Clive Owen and Denzel Washington elevate the plot even further. If you like thrillers with a smart story, you won't be disappointedTechnically speaking, this is a strong release: video is clean without spots or other debris, colours are accurate and there's a lot of detail visible, even in darker elements. Audio is also engaging with clearly intelligible dialogue and some nice pans round out a strong audio track.Extra's aren't abdundant but what is there, I found pretty interesting: some deleted scenes and interviews / featurettes.All in all, a strong recommendation for fans of thrillers / heist movies!"
2,The strong expletives had my head spinning,"A bank heist movie that makes you wonder if they'll get away with it. Good acting all around. Looked like Jodie Foster had a good time playing a character against type. However, the strong expletives had my head spinning. I felt like I needed to take a shower after it was over. Thus, I don't recommend this film."
4,If you figured it out you're almost as clever as the kid next to me,"This kind of movie prompts you to take wild guesses, but what is fun is the process and class of the movie. While the kid in the theater next to me figured it out from the start, while having some small mistakes, there was nothing lost in seeing how it all went down and the slight surprise at the end. Inside man is a feel good example of an old and dying art of the con man movie. Technology is getting far too perfect for these kind of brilliant man versus the system type movie. With the need of hacking eye scanners, finger print machines, motion sensors, time locked safes, security systems with off-shore staff that is awake twenty four hours a day, and even more things we can't even imagine but someone else did coming into play you need to be a billionaire to be a thief in the first place. So these movies will become more and more rare, so we should enjoy them while we can."
3,Above average acting but an average plot.,"The movie is engaging at times, but as far as a movie with a heist as a central theme is concerned, it falls way short. The movie has some social messages due to the fact that this is a Spike Lee movie but in essence the movie is very mediocre."
