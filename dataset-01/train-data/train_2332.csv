2,Dangerous long term strategy...,"The authors here claim success by taking mostly under 25 year olds and getting them to complete a marathon. I do believe this book will likely give you what you need to complete a marathon, but looking at the bigger picture it will likely not add to your long term health. Injury is so rampant in the running industry, and this book does not contain what most experts currently recommend. Especially with regards to running technique. This book recommends heal strike running, which is dangerous advice for most of the population. Read maffetone, chi running, pose method, natural running. I would say the 16 week 10% per week increase is the most valuable chart / page in the book, and if you are the type of person to think you can't finish a marathon, then it might contain some motivational reading chapters. I actually enjoyed the book but taking technique recommendations with a grain of salt."
5,You CAN run a marathon!,"Watching the Columbus marathon in Oct. 2006 motivated me to start running. Using the training methods in this book for 6 months enabled me to finish the Toledo Glass City marathon in 4 hours and 4 minutes. Before training, I never ran more than 5 miles at a time, I was always a sprinter and soccer player. Now, I am hooked, and will continue to expand on my long distance training. This book is a great training tool for first time marathon runners. Anyone can do it!"
5,Just finished 1st marathon THANKS to this book!,"Can't say enough good about this book. As a non-runner and husband/father with limited time, this 16 week program and only running 4 days a week brought me from a beginning jogger to completing my 1st marathon 2 days ago (Feb 1, 2009) in Huntington Beach. The focus on the psychology/attitude of running my first distance event as well as the physical training program were both invaluable. I followed the program exactly and it works. As a side note I also lost about 14 pounds during the training which was an unexpected benefit. Thank you, thank you to the authors."
5,Another Success Story!,"The most I had ever run at any given time was 2 miles before I decided to run the 2006 Chicago Marathon.I bought this book in May of 2006. At the time, I was not running or regularly exercising. I followed the pre-training program in the book to get to where I could run for 30 minutes without stopping.I started the actual training program on July 2nd, exactly 16 weeks before the Marathon and finished in 4 hours and 22 minutes. I could not have done it without this book. By the way, I recommended this book to a friend who finished in exactly 4 hours."
5,A MUST READ!!!!!!!!,"This is an outstanding book for those people who are serious about completing their first marathon. The book lays out a detailed , yet moderate, training program and also focuses on the psychological aspect of running and finishing a marathon. It is a 16 week training program. You read one chapter a per week and then you are on your way to completing your first marathon. It touches on diet, training, equipment and what to expect on the big day.This book is motivating and inspiring."
5,You can do it !!!,"I always wanted to run a marathon. Until now, the 42 kms distance appeared formidable. I had confidence in myself and had seen some good training programs on the web.But when I would tell my friends about my decision to run a marathon, they would laugh at me. And that used to scare me off a bit. They were all dead sure that it was IMPOSSIBLE for me to do it.Then, I found this great book. Not only did it give me all the confidence I needed but it also told me how to prevent injury and be in good form to finish my first marathon.Right now I am training to run my first marathon. But I know I can do it. ""If God be for us, who can be against us?""Any first timer without this book is risking too much!"
4,Can't finish reviewing quite yet,"Bought this book to start training for the Chicago Marathon. I am 50 years old and have never run a marathon. It is a week-by-week training guide that essentially guarantees that you will be able to finish the marathon if you follow their plan. The book is very easy reading. The chapters are written to read for each week of training. Works with your physical and psychological potential obstacles for completion of the marathon. So far, so good. I'll let you know whether it delivers after October 12, 2008!"
4,IT REALLY WORKS,"My husband and I started running 5Ks about 3 years ago. Last year he purchased the book in preparation for a 1/2 marathon that we ran two days after our wedding. With the 1/2 marathon under our belt, we thought, why not a marathon? Running in a running group with some folks that have completed multiple marathons and were running more miles during the week, I was skeptical that peaking at 36 weekly miles would sufficiently prepare us.We read the book weekly and followed the program pretty religiously. The mental training makes all the difference in preparing you. I would recommend this program to runners of all abilities. If you can complete the training, and remain hydrated during the marathon, you will finish.2004 Chicago Marthon Finisher"
4,You will be inspired,"I am not a runner but I wanted to train for the marathon and become a runner. This book inspired me, showed me the steps to take, and let me know what to expect throughout the training. Great read. Enjoy."
5,The Non-Runner's Marathon Trainer,"I'm not a runner, nor am I a big reader, but this book was truly inspirational. Definitely written for the novice with simple, easy to follow instructions for successfully completing your first marathon! Every chapter contains overwhelming testimonials from people that are going through the same experience. If you don't have a partner to train with, this book definitely compensates. I bought it because the Amazon reviews sounded too good to be true, but they were right on target."
5,I just finished about 2 hours ago!,"I'm sitting here typing this with salt on my face and a medal around my neck. I have this book to thank for finishing my first marathon, and I couldn't be happier.Believe the reviews, people, this program really works. If you're reading this, you're thinking about doing it. Know this... YOU CAN. This book will help get you there. Whitsett's book will not only train you physically, but mentally to cross the finish line. This is not a primer on how to run a fast marathon, but just how to get it done. If you stick to the training, you can do it.I don't know if I've ever felt a bigger sense of accomplishment in my life. You can have that feeling too. Trust your instincts. You want to do it! Do it!UPDATE: MAY 2011I finished my second marathon in October with a 3:50 time. I owe it all to this book. I can't recommend it enough!"
5,Very informative and motivating,"I love this book, it explains a lot of how your mind and body work, and it gives you motivational stories of other beginners. It gives training schedules, concentration tips, nutritional info and so much more. It is a pleasure to read as well, so I can highly recommend it!"
5,Great Book!,I read this book back in 2002 and 2003 while I was training for my first marathon. I just pulled it out and started reading it again recently and it is such a great book. Full of information and motivation to help with marathon training. I wish I would have gone to a college that offered a marathon class!
5,Useful informative book,I liked the book: it is well-written and has a lot of useful information on how to start running in general and how to train for marathon in particular.
2,"Very wrong on stretching, poorly designed training program","The author advocates static stretching, which has been proven many times over to be harmful. Also the training programs never have you running the distance of the race (or greater).I used this book for a while, then swtich to Galloway Training Programs and Danny Dreyer Chi-Running Technique and the results have been miraculous compared to what I got from the Non-Runner's Marathon Trainer."
3,Based on college programs,"This book is nothing more than the college marathon program in print. If your going to spend the time doing it, you might as well sign up for the class and get the group support and teacher to go with it."
2,Low Value per Mile,"If one has never run before this might be a reasonable book. Heavy on obvious and 'touchy-feely' advice, low on practical, up-to-date advice. Ten pages of good stuff packed into 150."
3,Read with other books on marathons,"Don't buy this book alone as a guide to finishing a marathon. I've found most of the information helpful, but I am so frustrated by the poor editing. I wish I could get past it. It also seems to be written by someone who simply took this class, not an expert. It's heavy on the mental aspect, but allows negative words to show up which are contrary to the overall message.Be sure to pick up John Bingham's books and the Dawn Dais Women's Guide. He offers good solid advice for beginners and she offers a great account of her own training for her first real physical endeavor - a marathon."
5,Using this book to train for the 2007 Marine Corp Marathon,Provides a nice step by step guide to training for a marathon. I will be a 1st timer.
5,Great book -- all aspects covered in a friendly manner,"I just finished the Marine Corps Marathon (Oct 2002) and used only this book to help me do it. I had run a half-marathon last May, but I started right at the beginning with the short ""long runs"" and I felt great during the marathon. There were definitely times when I dreaded my longer ""long runs"", but this book really helps you keep everything in perspective and not just inspires and teaches you, but helps you to recognize what you are subconsciously thinking and consciously inspire yourself. It gives you the major aspects of training: state of mind, health, reality (people's stories), and a plan.Now that I have run a marathon, I think I'll try a couple of other books to run more for time, but I'll always come back to Tanjala, Dave, and Forrest for a strong dose of ""You can do it!"""
1,Not enjoying,It seems very unscientific so far - mostly anecdotal so you are never sure of all the factors at play. The references to their religion even to the point of asserting that it is Gods will that I am reading the book is very offputting. There was no mention of this in the notes and I think the book should be in the religion/fairy tales category.
4,Great start for planning your trip,"The Duke bros. do a good job giving insights on what and where to plan for a guideless riverfloat. A bit too much of the Dukes horsingin kings and little on other species...also would have likedmore info on preparation and riversmarts. Nevertheless, itsthe best of the available info out there and has much more low budgetcharm than self-promotion. I've purchased two DVDs and am happywith both."
4,WWF Summerslam 91 : A match Made in Hell,"Summerslam 1991 had a very good card and it was a highly enticipated pay per view , this was the time were other than Wrestlemania summerslam was the next best thing , Good 6 man tag , virgil and ted have a good match were we see virgil take the million dollar title from ted. A jailhouse match , the match was ok but it was funny watching the mountie go to jail , Nasty boys and the legion of doom had a good match were we saw LOD take the gold home once again. Also Ultimate warrior & Hulk Hogan teamed up vs. SGT. Slaughter , Col. Mustafa and Gen. Adnan with Sid Justice as the special guest ref. This summerslma was pretty good don't hesitate to pick it up!"
1,Don't Get This!!!!!,"The Santa Cruz From Turtle Beach Systems Uses The Same Crystal 4620 chipset But, has many more features and much better sound than this no good sound card. So if you want better audio search for Turtle Beach Systems."
3,Is there any other capsule,These are the capsules that are similar to ones used by companies that put out supplements. I fill my capsules with fresh dried herbs.
5,Very pleased,"I have had many grapefruit spoons over many years--stainless steel, silver plated, sterling silver. But this one by Henckel far surpasses all others I have ever had. It does a fantastic job of lifting out the grapefruit slices. In the past, I've always had to use a knife to loosen the slices first. Not with this product. It is a joy to use. The handle is comfortable to hold but is quite top-heavy so it tends to fall out of the bowl when resting against the halved grapefruit. That though, is no big deal for me.I ordered one spoon to try and will order 3 more for us.I am also thinking of ordering 4 more as a gift."
3,grapefruit spoons,"I was disappointed in this spoon--the bowl of the spoon is too small--it won't hold the juice as well as a larger spoon. This was supposed to be such a wonderful spoon, and the little cheap wooden-handled one I used to have worked much better! I have small hands, and it's awkward to use."
1,Zwilling J.A. Henckels Twin Cuisine Grapefruit Spoon,I purchased this grapefruit spoon because of Henckels reputation for quality knives that fit the hand so well. Although I have very large hands I found this spoon to be very awkward to use.The handle is just way too thick. It sits in my kitchen drawer unused.
2,Not great for eating.,"It's over-sized handle is o.k., This feature may be better for a child or someone with hand problems. I just found it unnecessary. My biggest complaint is the small serrations. While it does cut through grapefruit, it has a tendency to catch pulp in the teeth. It doesn't seam to affect its performance but it is annoying. The spoon is shallow and narrow making it difficult to get the juice. It is also overpriced in my opinion. I will continue to use it when my others are in the dishwasher but it won't be my go to grapefruit spoon.Where this spoon might be better than my others is if I needed to spoon out many grapefruit for some kind of cooking project. Here the pulp stuck on the spoon wouldn't bother me nor the shallow scoop. The larger handle would be a better fit for long duration use, much like a thick pen doesn't cramp your hand.I am not a cook though and have little need for a large pile of grapefruit innards. I prefer to eat them one scoop at a time."
5,Fantastic gift for the grapefruit lover!,"I purchased just one for my sister who has a disability in her right hand. Soon after she tried this spoon using her right hand, she called me and raved how wonderful it was and how it worked perfectly and that she loved the fact that she could handle the handle very well. $11 is a lot for one spoon but you will see and feel the quality in this spoon right away. The edges on the spoon do not even feel sharp, but the work like they are really sharp. Fantastic spoon overall!"
4,A fast-paced mystery,"I read this book in one sitting. It is the first and only time that I have ever done this. I have read better books in my lifetime (Many), but few have kept me so interested that I was unable to close it until I found out the conclusion. I HIGHLY reccomend this book to just about anyone, and I look forward to hopefully read more from Miano."
2,Too large,"The stories are great, but I would recommend buying each book separately. With all three books in one cover, it makes the book very heavy and awkward to read. I'm guessing the book is about 5"" thick and weighs several pounds. I bought the book as a gift for my sister and it actually became a gag gift. We had several laughs about it. She was going to be traveling, and said she would have to leave 2 pairs of shoes at home so her suitcase wasn't overweight when she checked it at the airport."
4,I love all three books,"These stories tell how three very different woman are best friends and like sisters. They all have had setbacks but they overcame them with the support of their families and the men they fall in love with. Margo felt like I, she had to prove herself with out anyones help. Kate found out things about her past that she had to overcome; and altimitly had to ask for help the hardest thing she ever had to do. Laura did what she felt was right, and had to deal with a marriage breakup and raising her to daughters my herself. Thomas T helped them all with there problems by just being there for them."
4,favorite trilogy,"Nora Roberts is my favorite romance novel author, and this trilogy is my favorite one of them all. It has warmth, humor, and, of course, romance! She makes it easy for us to relate to the characters, which is one of the best things about her writing. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because Holding the Dream, the second book, was not as good as I expected it to be. Finding the Dream is my favorite...I can read it over and over again and I always get touched by it."
1,Cannot use this item,I am having twins and have two different cribs. Each designed differently. This mobile will not fit on either one. These things should be designed with adjustable attachments.
5,"Ferret-legging, you must read this","Years and years ago an office-mate brought in a copy Outside magazine with an article on ""Ferret-legging,"" and read to all of us. By the end of it we were dying with laughter. I made a xerox, which I saved for years, until I finally made the mistake of loaning to a friend (ex, now, obviously) WHO DID NOT RETURN IT.Now this compendium of Outside's comes out, and blessed Mary mother of God, it includes the ferret-legging piece.You must buy this, flip to ""King of the ferret-leggers,"" and read the piece. You'll thank me, honest you will.And I'm told there're some other stories in here as well. Think of them as gravy."
4,"Complex, interesting reading; if you can see it.",I concur with all of the previous glowing reviews. I have a beef with the publisher; the text is too small. I guess the font to be an 8.
4,Family's Plight,Laura Shapiro Kramer's book is wonderful.It shows how a family dealt with circumstances thrust upon them by seeking and exploring every available option.I gained a great deal of knowledge and insight reading about this family's experiences. It is an inspiring and thought-provoking story particularly for anyone dealing with a child who has special needs. I highly recommend this book!
5,Much fun.,"Nice Girls Finish First is about Kirby Green, a vice president of marketing, who ends up in a bet with her boss: if she can't get someone to call her ""nice"" in one month, she loses her job. And her assistant, Brianna, an aspiring opera singer, who's TOO nice.Either of their stories would be fun on its own, but together, it adds an extra oomph, with the contrast of Kirby trying to be nicer and Brianna trying to be less nice.Brianna's lists are hilarious, and I LOVED that she had to try to GAIN 35 pounds. Wonder if it's too late to decide to become an opera singer??"
3,eh...,"This is the first book I read by this author and I have to say I was disappointed.The story sounds really good, so that's why I bought it. I expected much more than what it is simply because her other books had done well. I'm not sure I'll ever read another book of hers. Maybe if it sounds good, and in hopes that it will be better!I found myself wanting to stop and put it down every coupole pages because it just could not hold my interest for very long. I'm not sure exactly why. But after days of struggling I finally finished it. The only good thing I did like was the moral of the story. That she was an actuall nice person all along and just didn't know it. The ending did make me happy for her though. To me that is what saved the book from being a 2 star rating."
4,"Useful, but not quite as directional as the title suggests","From the title, I guess I was hoping for some clear direction on what colours to use. Instead, the book gives an overview of colour usage during this period, and changing trends, supported by quotes from critics of the period and illustrated by many original images from contemporary paint companies, advertisers, books of architecture etc. So what the authors expect you to do is to study all of that material and make your own decisions on what colours to use. To help you, they provide a detailed list of equivalent modern paint colours from several major companies such as Sherwin. Although helpful, I would have appreciated something a bit easier to understand and some more direct suggestions of typical colour schemes for, say, 1880. It is fascinating to see the original illustrations but, despite the quality of the reproduction, it is not always easy to make out what colours they have used."
4,The Pilgrim Road satisfies,"The Pilgrim Road offers a lot of food for thought from early Christian writers. They were promoting a new belief system, often in hostile circumstances, and their comments are enlightening for our times."
2,Interesting Blend -- But I Hate the Marketers,"Not a bad first novel, incorporating a bit of a lot of different sf themes. It includes military, cyborgs, drugs, nanites, alien technology, global warming, cyberspace, love, hate, assassins, body-alteration, the end of civilization as we know it. Whew.But it is a real pain in the ass to get to the end of the book, find that NOTHING is resolved, and the ""sequel"" will be out in six months for another $7. This is a bad trend in publishing -- split a ""longish"" book into two pieces and make twice the money. In this case, however, the first half wasn't really too long and it could and should have been marketed as a single published work.So, the real rating is 4 stars for the book, and minus 2 stars for the publisher.If it looks like the publisher is going to stretch this out to 3 volumes, I won't bother with the second."
1,Yet Another Self-Solving Mystery,"Please, do not be fooled by all the big-name writers perched on the fence crowing about what a great book this is. In today's publishing market writers (espacially sci-fi writers) are whores. ""You stroke mine, I'll stroke yours"".If you're looking for a book where the hero does not have a guardian angel with near superhuman powers watching over her 24/7, this isn't it.On the surface Razorface (if Elton John were dead he'd be spinning in his grave) is a ruthless druglord-gangster-kingpin, but in truth, he's a big-hearted ol' family-type goof just looking after the 'hood - and, of course, our heroine, Jenny. The book hints at a big mystery aching to be unravelled, but Jenny doesn't actually solve any of it, she merely waits for Razorface to put his ""peeps"" on it and then report back (Doyle IS spinning in his grave).This has become such a common plot device (crutch for the plot-impared)it deserves its own category in literature."
2,"Mediocre, politically correct, boilerplate","The book is not badly written, but the plot is boilerplate formula. The biggest problem with the book is that Ms. Bear is way too eager to use the book as a platform to establish her political correctness. Her references to ""white cracker"" asses and ""christian fascists"" etc. ring so false that they ruin the story completely."
3,Interesting but confusing,"I really wanted to like this book. It's got a lot of things going for it- a future setting; an older woman with a lot of history and some age-related problems were two of the strongest attractions.However, the book was very jumpy and it got confusing. I wondered if the author had taken the various scenes that made it up and shuffled them to determine their order!And while I appreciated that it wasn't English-only- it would have been kind to have the French dialog translated in footnotes for those of us who don't know it; I felt like I was missing out."
3,Where's the digital restoration?,"I bought this video for the coaster footage. They did not bother to digitally remove the scratches from the film. Even though this version is much clearer than the VHS version, the scratches are quite bothersome throughout the show. If you are going to release a film on DVD, one should always go the full mile."
1,Incredibly bad film making,"The movie is actually more retarded than the title which at first judgement would seem impossible.Mr. Ray Dennis Steckler (Cash Flagg) has provided a campy monster flick set in a carnival background. Without looking at Carol Brandt in leotards this film was a complete waste of time. So many dragged out scenes that don't amount to anything entail about 75% of the 100 minutes. Bad burlesque numbers and sexy costumes aren't enough to keep most people's attention, let alone a B-Movie buff as myself.The bad acting isn't even worth laughing at, because it's so dull. Some movies are so bad that they achieve a cult status such as this.Don't waste your money."
5,Savage Horizons,One of the series on Caleb Sax and his life in the 1800's extremely interesting . It is a western from a different point of view a wonderful book on it's own or as part of the trilogy. I read this first many years ago and never forgot about it. I was thrilled to find the entire trilogy online as an ebook and was thrilled to read it again.Anyone interested in history or historical westerns will love this series as much as I do.
2,not worth the price,"I am happy that other reviewers had said the diverter wasn't in the box or that would have bben a problem, however this is way overpriced for the quality, esp since rhe diverter was included. The whole back part of the handles are plastic not metal of any kind. Also it is not a tightly made unit. 59 at most is what it should be."
1,Horrible album,"This album is absolutely horrible. I wish that I would not have wasted my money on it. It is not nearly as good as the album with ""pile of gold"" on it."
2,Not what i was expecting,"I was expecting to find out how spyware actually works and how to roll up your sleeves and eradicate it from your computer manually. I wanted some indepth details of how to scour the registry for naughty entries. I beleive there were myabe 3 pages total dealing with this. I wish it had step by step examples of how to remove spyware manually.In a nutshell here's what you get from this book:1. Spyware/Malware definitions that explain the difference betweent the two2. Use Spybot, Adaware, and a few other programs to defend against spyware.3. How to use Anti-Spyware programs.4. Spyware/Malware usually is installed by hiding itself in other programs you install.If you are expecting to learn about the nuts and bolts of spyware, this isn't the book for you."
3,"Decent soundtrack, but missing a couple of songs...","Decent soundtrack - would have been a GREAT soundtrack if it had included Sam Cooke's ""A Change is Gonna Come"" or the original version of ""Compared to What"" like another reviewer noted (probably due to licensing issues). Still mostly good songs & worth the price but if your heart is set on the incredible Sam Cooke song, get the ""Portrait of A Legend"" CD also."
1,Not Compatible,"The Fit Check said that this product would fit my 4.9L I6 Ford F150. So when the product arrived, I got to work on replacing my old regulator. After about 2 hours of work, I realize that this wont fit my truck. The bolt hole mount is completely different. Mine has 2 bolt holes in that are center to the middle of the regulator, this one has 3 bolt holes. At first I thought ""Well, I'll just bolt the two in and leave the third alone."" But upon further inspection, the 2 bolt holes that I would need to use aren't evenly spaced. So I was forced to reinstall the old regulator and ship this one back. Check your old regulator thoroughly before purchasing this, Amazons fit checker is either not accurate enough to know what fits what, or someone has listed the wrong vehicles that use this part."
4,Exquisite Stylistic Golf Book,"Worth finding just for the illustrations! I obtained my copy and purchased more for presents at a real discount!Even if you have to pay a little, this book is worth it! Magnificent, unique illustrations by world renown impressionist Ray Ellis! I love his shot of the ""Practice Area at Augusta."" His watercolors of renown courses and other golf sketches are just fantastic! You won't see much like them elsewhere and some are available to purchase, at some galleries and from his website.Added to this great art is commentary by Ben Wright and a great Intro written by that dean of golf writers, Herbert Warren Wind.Great addition to golf afficiando!"
1,Sucks,"Sucks, lies, horrible, witch, crap, did I mention lies? Pathetic, loser, can't spell, ugly, dumb, good thing nobody wasted any money buying it heap of turd."
5,"If it is not the sound and lights, don't bother.","It appears in reading other reviews and looking at the pictures that Fisher Price has changed its' airport drastically. We have the set that has sounds and lights and also has another car with an attachment. I must confess, I find the sounds and lights to be the best part, as does my son. He loves making the airplane ""take-off"", the helicopter ""whirl"", the taxi and the car ""rev"", the luggage carasel ""sing"", and the barricade tell him to ""stop, please pay the toll"", or ""go"". It is a great toy, but is definitely worth looking for the sounds and lights version."
3,"Good toy, not fabulous, kid likes it, too big for storage...","This toy is one of maaaannnnny little people toys my son has. Overall, I like their products and so does my son. Although my son likes this product as much as all the others, I like this one the least. The main reason is that it is the only one that can't be put away. Once it it opened up and put together it will only break down into two peices. Each piece is still way to big for any of my bins or shelving areas. It does fit under our air hockey and train tables. I move it around as I need to for organization, but it seems really odd to be lacking such an important feature. There is no advantage to buying this toy over another little people item that provides better storage. They can do that same imaginary play with any of them."
2,once a good toy until they changed it,all the reviews say good things about the great sounds and lights this toy makes. But in fact I just bought this because of the sounds and lights... my child had one and lost piecies so I bought another. But they changed it. It no longer makes the hilicopter sounds or lights up. We were very disapointed. Once a great toy now boring
4,Little Peoples Airport,My grandson and my son was very pleased with this item. It is played with constantly.
4,Toddler Fun,"My 22 month old loves this Little People Airport. He has several other Little People sets, but this is his favorite."
4,This durable toy is my son's favorite,"My son got this airport as a gift at 20 months and 6 weeks later, it is still his favorite toy. We have several F-P little people playsets and like to use them with this airport.Unlike some other reviewers here, we are VERY glad that it did not come with any battery-hungry and annoying lights and sounds to irritate mommy & daddy's nerves. It's getting harder and harder to find toys these days where the only noise comes from the children themselves.The playset was easy to assemble and comes apart for storage. The only negatives I've seen are that the windsock and umbrella are easily removed (and lost), but all in all, this set gives our son quite a bit of self-play and helps him develop his imagination. Where else but here can you see a Fisher-Price sheep pilot a passenger jet?"
4,Some Confusion??,"From reading the prior reviews, I think there is some confusion surrounding exactly what this toy is and isn't. First off, it IS a Toys R us exclusive. It does NOT, however, have flashing runway lights or make sounds activated by the vehicles. I think the cause of confusion is that this new TRU version looks EXACTLY like the old Discovery Airport, but is not battery operated. I was not at all disappointed when I received this, though. From what I've read about Discovery Airport, parents constantly complained that the sounds never worked properly. (Perhaps the reason it was discontinued???) And Discovery Airport was very expensive; it was priced as high as [$$$] in the Fisher Price store! This new airport is certainly a less costly alternative. My only issue with the toy is that if it includes pilots for the planes, why not a driver for the taxi?"
4,Hit Toy!,"I got this toy for then 16-month old son and he likes to roll the car over the bridge. It does not make any noise but I don't think it really matters. He loves to sit inside the road track and play.The helicopter is a hit, he can play with it by itself. My husband took luggage and patio umbrella out and hit them since they may be most likely in his mouth and could be swollen. The only thing is this toy is bulky to store and place on the floor so I gave 4 stars to this set instead of 5 stars but this outweighs fun provided by this toy for my son."
2,Disappointed With Fisher Price,"I bought the Little People Airport for my daughter one Christmas and the toy lasted for less than a year. It worked great at first and when it stopped, I thought all it needed were new batteries but that wasn't the problem. Even the Little People Discovery City stopped working. What has happened to Fisher Price? Their toys used to be so durable? Right now I'm not so sure I even want to invest in the Discovery Town they just came out with."
3,Child needs to be closer to 2,"I thought this was a very cute toy, but my 16 month old daughter wasn't too interested in it. She liked some parts but not enough to hold her attention. I think I will pull it out when she gets older. Plus, it is a bit large to store. I would get it only for children that are really interested in airports or driving around cars. My daughter seems to like the Little People house much better."
4,My kids love this airport!,"This airport is so cute and all my children, ages 5, 3 and 9 months love to play with it. No, it doesn't make any nifty sounds or light up but it is still a lot of fun to play with!"
4,MOMMA MIA,"This toy is wonderful, my daughter recently turned one, and she loves the helicopter, plane and automobile. The only negative thing that I can say about this product is the size, if you do not have a lot of floor room it can be a little overwhelming."
4,Pretty good toy,"Since their daddy works at an airport, this toy is much loved by my two boys (ages 2 and almost 4)! They play with it daily and know the proper names of everything. It's not super educational otherwise but it's fine for them."
4,Best choice in its niche,"I needed additional storage for a MacBook Pro for my media (photos, iTunes, movies, etc). Because of bus-power, small size & light weight (unlike the orange rubber rugged style), I could stick this to the outside of the MBP with a velcro spot, and it looks ok. Everything works great and having both USB and FW is very useful (for mac).I give it only four stars because I really wanted a 7200rpm drive, which doesn't seem to be available in the small format. (That's probably not quite fair of me...but I still want it)."
4,Really Great Overview,"This is a wonderful disc, covering a really wide range of European and African music, and makes for a great way explore and increase exposure to quality world music. If you enjoy any one of the artists included here you'll find the others to be equally good."
4,History of the religions of the world,"This book covers information about the world's religions including, Rome, Greece, Israel, Egypt, China, India and Persia, from 4,500 BC. It also describes Augustus Caesars life and how the religions of the world impacted and had an impact on Roman expansion of the world. I enjoyed the author's way of relating history through storytelling; which makes the information come alive and it is easier to remember. I also enjoyed learning about Herod the Great and his relationship with Antony of Rome. I had the feeling that the authors opinion about eternity is based on the golden rule of: do unto others as you would have them do unto you and that by doing that, you will obtain eternal life. She observed that this was the basic premise of all world religions. This view of eternal life is not biblically based. Based on what I read in this book, I think that the author had a difficult time leaving her opinion about religion out of the narrative."
3,"Slightly different design than in the picture and not perfectly rectangular, but good price and fast shipping","Slightly different design than in the picture and not perfectly rectangular, but good price and fast shipping. What I mean by ""not perfectly rectangular"" is that the top edge is maybe an inch or so longer than the bottom edge giving it a lop-sided appearance. The design of the crossed gun and hoe is done slightly different in the picture with a more simplistic look to it. the bayonet on the gun is a rectangle and a triagle put together to give the impression of a bayonet, looking on the internet I do not see any other flags done like this."
4,good stuff,Nice flag shipped on time. Had a little trouble with the order but the seller remedied them in a timely manner.
5,"Far-Out , Out-of-sight and Dynamite CD","This CD is awesome. The musics in these cd brings back the reminiscing of the 70's. As you listen to the pulsating techno groove sounds of saxs and congo, it reminds me the beats of The Gap Band and The Earth, Wind and Fire roll into one. Especially the last song called Shapes and Sizes, it makes you feel like dusting your old disco shoes and put on your old polyester white suit and dance like JT."
3,Good info on supplements and diet,"I'd give this book a higher rating if the book had been updated since '99. This book is a quick read if you've looked at other ADD nutrition books...dump the sugar, simple carbs, food additives, and increase vitamins and supplements...Zimmerman's arguments for why certain supplements, like fatty acids, are good for you, is an interesting read. Her 30-day diet to feed your brain and isolate food allergies that may aggravate your ADD sypmptoms is not as tough as it seems, and I have found the supplements to be exceptionally helpful for treating the aspects of my ""creative wiring"" that I don't like -- procrastination, inertia, etc. I found it a worthwhile read."
3,disappointed,"This book promised a lot of help and we did take a few nuggets of useful information from it. The author takes forever to get to the essence of the plan so be prepared for a lot of reptition of information you've probably already heard by the time you are ready to try this plan. I don't know what planet this author lives on but unless you are ready to make every meal,snack etc. from organic scratch, you will have a tough time following the plan, we couldn't commit. Our physician also reported the low possibility of influencing brain chemistry through diet as 1-2% of all the children with this problem. good luck"
3,Options to meds worth exploring,"As a mother of a teenager with ADD-inattentive type who has been off and on meds for 2 years, I had read a lot about possible nutritional changes/supplements that have had some success in helping people with ADD. I thought this book did a great job in explaining the research that has been done regarding chemical/metabolic differences in people with ADD. The explanation of the reasons for temporarily or permanently eliminating certain foods from your diet was pretty sparse. To try and eliminate all those foods would be very hard, so we are trying the vitamin supplement route first to see if that has a positive effect on our daughter. The book definitely made me realize that the meds only solution is not the only answer out there and made me was to explore other options."
1,Supplement industry consultant!,"Part of the author's bio says she is a consultant to the supplement industry. No wonder. The list of (mostly unproven) supplements is looooooong and probably costly. I can't imagine a child or adolescent taking all of these. I'm looking for an alternative remedy for my child's ADD, but this book was no help. I'm returning it."
4,A well organized guide to achieving excellent color styles,"This little monograph is in a ring binder with well reproduced color illustrations of attractive color styles and color combinations. These dyeings have been achieved with cold dyeing Procion MX dyes (BASF - originally invented by ICI) now supplied by three recommended small volume suppliers. The dyeing procedures are simple and easy to use at home, achieving lovely effects on approx 30in x 30in mercerized cotton woven fabric prepared for Printing (Dyeing). It is amazing what lovely fast dyed effects can be achieved at home by a cold dyeing method. Ann Johnston has given the craft trade a gem, particularly intersting for the quilter."
1,Weak at best...,"I really wanted to like this book. The design is good - a spiral notebook style, hard cover, compact size, but ultimately, the content is lacking. I have been dyeing my own fabric for a while now and find that this book added nothing to my skills. Her instructions are, at times, vague and at a twenty four dollar price tag, could have been expanded. I think the price tag reflects quality of product rather than content. Frankly, I have received better, free, low-water immersion instructions on-line at various dye selling websites."
2,lacking,I'm very disappointed with this book. There's really very little information in it. I was hoping for more on technique. I've found better info just searching the internet.
5,Dr Bulgakov's Casebook,"Nine interwoven stories of a young newly qualified Doctor experiencing life in a far flung rural village. The opening tales are amusing and detail the illiterate superstitious peasantry; a culture totally at odds with the progressive hopes of the 20th century. Syphilis isn't feared as everyone has it, what they want is something to soothe the sore throat! And in the background is the revolution...The first seven stories, to be honest,are straight forward Doctor's anecdotes. A Russian 'Dr Finlays casebook' if you like. But its the final two tales; 'Morphine' and 'The Murderer' that sets this book above the rest.The harrowing tale of decent into addiction cannot be bettered and is still a sobering warning, and the tale of the growing terror of the revolution is Russian literature at its best. These two stories push this book from ok to exceptional."
2,Beware the Forbidden Zone!,"Any time a sci-fi book/movie/show has a ""Forbidden Zone"" I tend to tune out, and so it is with this Who novel. With no chapters to aim for, this book is 159 endless pages. Why is the Black Guardian story kept as a ""B"" plot while everyone runs around a spaceship with two people on it? Why do I keep pushing along when I don't care about finishing the book? Do not waist time reading this poor excuse for a New Adventure. Read a classic Target novel, and ignore this story."
5,clean connections,"Great 1/4 inch cables that I use to connect drum machines to my mixer. I love these cables, and use the M DJ cables for the majority of my connections."
4,UNICEF Book of Children's Poems,"This book gave you a good view of what people do in their lives, in different parts of the world, in the form of poetry. When I read the poem about a dove giving a flower to a girl because she was more worthy than the rays of sun, I feel very important because I am like that child."
5,One of the BEST books on spirituality and rock music,"I am not sure why more people don't know about this book, but it is excellent. It weaves some of the early intertwining of Pentecostal spirituality and rock music together that is simply downright fascinating. Highly recommended in lieu of the other schlocky writers who are now churning out ridiculous tomes on rock music and spirituality from a fundamentalist Christian perspective. Bravo!"
4,Inspired and Impressive,"Although I, myself, am not deaf or hard of hearing, many of my family members are. It was due to this that I took my first ""real"" job as an Audiological Assistant at REM Audiology in Philadelphia. Through my work I was inspired to learn as much as I could about hearing difficulties. This book was one of the first that I read on the subject, and I was thouroughly impressed. Not only did Kryter delve into the causes of loss, but also explored ways to prevent common problems. I reccomend this book to anyone who wants to learn about their hearing, and it is on our Must Read list at the office."
5,Icing tool,Nice piece of equipment to work with. Easy to hold and not too large to comfortably work with the cake.
3,compact spatula,"~~ a little light and a little small, depending on your intent.But where space is at a premium , it will probably do the trick. However I wish I had bought a larger more sturdy feeling one. This feels like a toy."
3,Live Center,"This item was defective when I got it. It had bad bearings. I sent it back, and got another one that is fine."
1,Wrong Item!!!,"I, as well, received the wrong live center. I sent an email to customer service and am waiting to hear back from them. Hope to get this resolved soon. I was going to let this go until I saw so many wrong items have been shipped out."
1,live center,"Not good, I didn't want this one, it wasn't the one in the picture. Why is is the same order number as the fully tapered number. You should change it!"
2,Not the Live Center Pictured!!,This is not the live center pictured. Go to PSI's website to see the correct live center. It is not the 60 degree one in the pic.
1,Wrong item...,"What was shipped is not what was pictured. A replacement is on the way, not sure what good that is going to be since Amazon has the item listed incorrectly. With 2 customers posting the same review."
2,Fair Selection and poor sound/picture quality,"This type of DVD's are good source when you just want to have a certain video of your favourite artist. But the picture quality of the first video, ""La Paga by Juanes"" is just terrible.Then ""Llorare las penas by David Bisbal"" is blurry and the audio is really bad.I think these companies should provide at least the same quality as shown on Cable or Satellite broadcastings.Maybe I am asking too much, but that's just my opinion.If you don't mind buying this DVD for 4 of 5 artists and not caring about its quality, then get it."
2,Too odd,I found this book very hard to read considering all I have read are Agathas suspense novels. I was rather dissapointing to see this type of writing style. Her suspense and romantic novels are both very well written out but to see this side of her kind of ruined the whole detective novels. I wouldn't recommend this to readers who like her original style...
1,Horrible shredder,"When we got this thing it was great. it handled everything we threw at it beautifully and effortlessly. then after about 6 months, the containter was full, we turned it off, emptied the container, and it never powered back on again. i called royal and their help desk is a recording telling me to mail my reciept to a PO box in New Jersey to get the return authorization. forget that, i need a shredder, not to wait 4 months for them to get back to me.so i called the local service center and talked to one of their repair techs. he told me its one of two things, the fuse thats soldered to the main board or the main board fried. reguardless, the labor warrenty is only 90 days so i would have to pay $48 an hour labor to fix it. the tech said he considers these disposable, use it till it breaks and buy a new one."
1,This thing is a waste of your hard earned money,"Ok...if you have read all the reviews on this thing and are still considering this product, then something is wrong with your head. Similar to other stories on here, I picked up the Royal 1280MX just 5 days ago. Works okay with paper. Tried the CD shredder slot- first one worked great. 2 days later tried another CD (only the second one)...it jammed, tried to auto reverse it out, then kicked itself off. Following the instructions for auto-shutdown...I left it off for 25 minutes (the rest of the night). Tried it again in the morning and the stupid thing wouldn't even power on. IT IS DEAD!! Lucky for me this happened as soon as it did...I am returning this for a full refund and buying a new shredder that works (checking reviews like this first). BUYER BEWARE!!!"
2,Stopped working within a year of purchasing,"When shredding paper, credit cards, & CD/DVDs worked great--but, its effectiveness didn't last. While shredding a pile of papers, the shredder jammed. I don't think I exceeded the maximum sheets allowed at one time. But, even after attempting to clear the shredder's blades (difficult, if not impossible), the shredder turns on (sometimes), but it won't shred. I can not locate my receipt, so I'm stuck with a $100 useless box of cheap plastic."
1,One star because I can't rate it any lower,"Not much I can add to the other negative reveiws, other than to say the reviews are accurate. This is a horrible shredder!Worked fine..for about 2 months..then nothing. Just will not work..period. I did not misuse shredder, no nails, staples or anything of the sort. In fact, I didn't put anything thru it except paper.Now I've got to buy another one. TWO MONTHS..and it failed.We're not talking daily or heavy useage either. I'm talking for home use, nothing heavy...just c-card,bank statements..etc. TWO MONTHS of light use, and it fails.Unless you just like throwing your money away, do not buy this product."
2,Worked fine for less than a year,"Worked fine for several months while I routinely shredded paper, mail, and credit cards. Then the other day, I shredded my first CD - DEAD ! Machine is toast. Looks like the gears were stripped by the CD. The label is misleading for stating that you can shred CD's - don't do it !Now I'm in the market for a Fellowes shredder with higher ratings...."
1,Not woth it,"I agree with all the negative reviews... I've had mine since 2/28/06 and it is always jaming with just paper shreddes. Have to stop wait and start again. I shreddered a few CD's and then sheddered some paper and tried to shredd a CD and it died. I called Royal and they said I had to either take it to a service dealer or send it back with the warrant. Well it's now 10/06/06 and dead and if I send it back to them I feel it wil take too long to be checked out. So I am going to take it to a service provider, they most likely will tell me the trurth on this peice of gargage. Once it's fixed or replaced, I'll be in the market for somerhing better... Royal should be ashamed of themselves for putting this on the market at this price. And their customer service should know more english."
1,Top Heavy Disaster Waiting To Happen,"It took two shipments to finally get a shredder that made it in one piece. The shredder device itself is heavy duty, super quiet and does an excellent job. But the down side is the shredder part is so heavy it is easily knocked over because the waste basket is made from cheap plastic and weighs only 6-1/2 lbs. While the shredder weighs about 20 lbs. The first shredder was poorly packed and the basket was in pieces from the shredder banging around in the box and breaking the basket into little pieces. I suggest keeping the casters of an that should help steady the shredder on the basket. If it weren't for the stupid safety switches I'd put this shredder on a better built basket."
1,Garbage,"Way overpriced. Mine completely died just after a year. Even when it was new, it jammed on its third CD. I continued to use the shredder for paper only. It recently died after very minimal use - just junk mail etc. Very cheap gears. Labeling this shredder as professional is a joke.I'm currently in the market for a new shredder. Stay away from Royal."
4,good case,"This case has been good. its strong enought, doesnt get dust, it surface is beautiful. a good compliment for your new iphone."
1,Pass,"I bought this product hoping to be a better fit than the agent 18 plastic case that I have and it was not a tight fit at all. It was too lose on the iphone and when i was talking with it on, my face actually had enough space between it and the phone to where the screen was interacting with my face movements and dialing random numbers and such, while I was talking."
2,I don't recommed it,"The book wasn't really what I expected. It's a good compillation of several quite old and basic articles. It's not really a ""book"", with a logical and ordered content. I wouldn't reccomend it."
3,"Good for ""old school""","This is a well established book with a very credible track record, however, it is misleading having the hood of a BMW E36 on the cover. The E36 is a modern BMW by all standards; this book has about three two-paragraph articles on that car while all the other stories and pages pertain to the E30 (1983-1992) and earlier cars. If you are the owner or if you are fascinated with how to work on cars older than 15 years, this book is for you."
4,This is not a bad book!,"The games here are interesting to look at. You can locate and play through the games (using your database program such as Chessbase, etc) on your own, analyze the games on your own and then using your computer if you like. Finally you can quickly read through the author's comments and see what salient points he has to offer. I like to read my chess books this way, because it really cuts back on the hard work of going back and forth between the words/notation and the chess board."
5,Butterfly Lion,"Excellent! I read this aloud at night with my daughters, ages 9 & 7. We ALL loved it. Morgpurgo quickly draws you in to feel compassion for the lion and for the boy. They both lose each other in Africa and then reunite years later in war-torn Europe, as grown man and adult lion. Mr. Morpurgo takes his reader through the sadness of loss and then through the happiness of triumph...and throws in a bit of a twist at the end. My daughters will definitely re-read this book on their own. A perfect choice for birthday & Christmas gifts."
5,This book captured my imagination,"This story is the winner of the Smarties Prize and Writers Guild award. A boy called Bertie rescues an orphaned white lion cub from the African Veldt. They are inseparable until Bertie is sent to boarding school far away in England and the lion is sold to a circus. Bertie swears that one day they will see one another again, but the butterfly lion never forgets their friendship.I would recommend this story to nine to thirteen year olds. I would give this story a mark of ten out of ten for being so interesting and capturing my imagination. My best character was the butterfly lion because I felt really sorry for him that he left his friend to go to the circus. My favourite part is when the butterflies fly away from the chalk picture of the lion on the hillside."
4,?,After reading War Horse I wanted to read more by the author. I ordered the ones he said were his personal favorites. Been pleased with all three that I ordered.
1,Waste of money,"This book is a waste of money. You can find all the information online that was written in this book. Do not waste your money. Additionally, do not use their website resume writing service. Unprofessional and clearly not able to write a good resume."
2,"Archaeology and ""mind""","I could not get past the first of the sample I put I my Kindle. It is too bad because it looked promising as it called to light the political correctness of behavioral archaeology. Unfortunately the author tries to make too many statements very early on about how synapse and chemistry are what our minds are. They even say point blank that we know ""more or less"" how our brains create consciousness! Of course this is ludicrous. The materialistic explanations for everything has utterly ruined science. Even archaeologists are in on the mechanistic worldview."
3,A sequence that doesn't match the original,This book is the sequence of the excelent Mind In the Cave book. But this book isn't so good than the original. Some points of view seems forced and don't have the same appeal that the original's ones.
4,Another great one,"It's a shame that we allways have to wait so many years for the next one. Not as good as Book 1 and 2. The first book i read in german, the rest in english, started back in 1990. Turn it off. Let them live and win this war agains the chtorr. Great stuff but as everybody else says. Keep it going or end it, but DO SOMETHING. It's not fair to all of us, who buy your books. Think about it!"
5,Where's book 5?!?!?!?!,"Well, i think this whole series is great and i'm tired of waiting for book 5, i heard he started it a long time ago, i think it was supposed to be called "" A Method for Madness"" but haven't heard squat about it for-ev-er!"
4,A very good series. But he didn't end the story in book 4.,"I have read all four books and found them to be a very good series. I like the fact that our hero is not a superman. Gerrold did not end the story in book 4. I have been looking for book 5, but have yet to find it. I do not thick he has written it yet or has chosen to do so."
4,Re: Sexual Orientation 101 stinks,"I personally loved this book and, in fact, the entire series up to and including Book 4. Developping the sexual orientation of the lead character was not intended for shock value. It was necessary to show his misunderstanding of what love is and his worthiness of love. The limericks served no literary purpose; however, they did serve a purpose in regards to the plot. Very simply, they kept the protagonist sane (relatively anyway). I think virtually anyone who read and enjoyed the previous two books will love this one."
1,Sexual Orientation 101 stinks,"I read the first two books and loved them. Looked for books 3 and 4 at a Book Sale and found them. How exciting! I regret,however, to report (at least in my view) that A Rage for Revenge is a real BUMMER. The limmericks,although clever,serve no useful purpose and the attempt to develop(?) the sexual orientation of our hero was pointless. With the command Gerrold has for exceptional writing, why did he stoop to this level? Was it for shock value or what?I hope book 4 is better or I will be extremely disappointed."
1,Go Video worst products made,"I GOT A TA2050 LCD TV ABOUT 7 MONTHS AGO. THE BACKLIGHT HAS GONE OUT. I EMAILED GO VIDEO ABOUT THE PROBLEM AND REQUESTED TO TALK TO SOMEONE NOT TO EMAIL ME BACK. WHAT HAPPENS, I GET AN EMAIL BACK, STATING SOMEONE WILL GET BACK TO ME IN 48 HRS. I WAITED 7 DAYS AND FINALLY CALLED THEM BACK, HAD A HARD TIME GETTING THREW THE 10 MINUTES OF VOICE MESSAGES, ONLY TO BE TOLD THAT THE TV I SPENT 600.00 ON ONLY HAD A 3 MONTH WARRANTY, AFTER HEARING THIS I GOT A LITTLE UPSET AND ASKED TO TALK TO A MANAGER AND WAS TOLD NO BY THE CUSTOMER SERVICE REP. I INSISTED TO TALK TO SOMEONE ELSE AND WAS HUNG UP ON BY THE CUSTOMER SERVICE REP. DO YOU WHAT THIS TO HAPPEN TO YOU, I DONT THINK SO. DON'T BUY GO VIDEO PRODUCTS"
4,british classic,I thought this was a absolute bargain for this wonderful group of 50's british black and white movie set although the story lines are a little corny in todays standards i just loved the way each story took me back to times of my growing up in england only a boy at that time.I enjoyed all the cars and trucks they use as this is my favourite automobile period full of cars that i now collect this is great winter time entetainment that takes me back in time.
2,Get thee to an editor,"Monk with identity crisis wallows in boring angst, wastes 2-1/2 hours not killing monsters."
4,DDP get's his,"Finally DDP is given the strap, but what makes this PPV so great is that Hogan was originally booked to win, (go figure) and he couldn't take the pace of DDP (45) Sting (alright he ruled wcw) and Flair (52) and gets injured midway through the match, leaving DDP to get the belt on the fly, its a true classic for this match only the rest is the typical WCW ppv which usually rivals Thunder in excitement. Hack and Bigealo is alright too."
4,One of the best,May be the best p.p.v ever.The best match was Hack vs. Bam Bam Bigelo in a no rules match.And the fatel fourway match. You want to get this movie.
3,Expensive Shipping Charges,"Ten cute little sugar sticks for coffee or tea, but they came in a large box and shipping was $10.00 on a $7.00 lightweight product. Wish I paid attention to that...sugar is not worth $17.00. Product is nice, but shipping is ridiculous."
4,SO FAR- SATISFIED,I SEARCHED ON LINE FOR A LONG TERM ICE MAKER WATER FILTER AND THIS ONE WAS EASY TO INSTALL AND VERY REASONABLY PRICED. IT IS NOT A STAGE 3 FILTER BUT IS SUFFICIENT FOR AN ICE MAKER. REMAINS TO BE SEEN ON HOW LONG IT'S EFFECTIVE BUT FOR NOW IT LIVES UP TO THE POSITIVE REVIEWS AND AS USUAL AMAZON CAME THRU WITH A GREAT PRICE AND FREE SHIPPING!
3,NO hardware,"From the item description, I expected to receive fittings for hook-up. Nothing but the filter was included. After a trip to the hardware store and $10.00, I was ready to go to work. Hook-up was easy and flushed for at least 1 hr to get the black (charcoal?) crap out. After that, I finished hook-up. Was very careful not to over-tighten fittings and had leaks in both the inlet and outlet. Finally resorted to using TFE tape on both and leaks stopped. Hope it works!!"
4,"It's a water filter that filters water. Pretty amazing, huh?","This replace my old 1,500 gallon ice and water filter with a 20k gallon filter for a very reasonable price. It was easy to install and seems to be doing what a water filters do, so, mission accomplished! I wish I could say it turns water to wine but that may be asking a bit much for 30 some-odd bucks."
4,Easy to Install and Does the Job Removing Clorine Taste,"I use the Watts 5YR filter as a pre-filter for my coffee maker. As far as improving the chlorine taste, it does about the same job as the $10 filter it replaced, but takes up much less room. The filter is simple to install. My coffee maker is designed for an in-line filter. Installation was a snap. I have not noticed any scale buildup on the coffee maker, but then our water is from Lake Michigan and has few dissolved solids.I have not run into the quality control problems that other buyers mention. The quality control issue does concern me, but I do not know how wide spread it is.I think that from my experience, if you are looking to remove all volatile organics, small particulates, and specific water-borne contaminants, there are much better filters on the market. However those filters also have a case, wall mount brackets and are more expensive initially. For ease of installation for a coffee maker or refrigerator, this is a good choice."
1,Odd water taste from filter,I have had this for 8 months with episodes of odd tasting water-worse then tap water. My tap water is okay on its own. Now looking to replace it with anything that tastes normal/good-even if it last only a year or less. I don't want 5 years of odd tasting water. I bought my filter from Lowes but it is the same manufacturer.
5,"Watts 5YR Premier Filter -5Year/20,000 Gal. Inline Ice Maker Water Filter",Bought this item because I already had purchased a similar productand I am very satisfied with this purchase. This product you put it inand you don't have to change filters for 5 years and then you just buyanother one. Very happy and does'nt cost too much. Great buy!!!
4,Watts 5yr premier filter,Product works great for filtering the water going to my ice maker. I don't seem to have any bad taste from the ice. Seems to do the job.
5,Water line filter,This filter is exactly what I wanted and is doing a great job. The Watts 5 yr. Premium filter is a quality product and I will purchase it again.
4,"Works fine, follow directions, note for copper pipe","Seems to work. You DO have to make sure to follow the directions and let the filter run into a bucket for 15 minutes. Otherwise you WILL get carbon dust in your water. One note: the filter comes with fittings for PLASTIC tubing, not copper. If you have copper tubing, you need to buy collets for the water connections."
2,Fails Taste Test,"This is a good filter for the money. Easy to install and replace the filter later. However, DO NOT BUY for taste. It does not remove Chlorine and does not improve 'taste'."
1,"Too bad, water still tastes like chlorine.","Installed and flushed unit for 1/2 an hour. Initial black carbon water was flushed out. Water tasted like chlorine. Flushed for an additional 1/2 hour, still tasted like chlorine. Kept it for a week. Kept giving it a try. I thought it might be defective so I returned it and bought the same model from another store. This unit also performed poorly with the same results. I returned it and bought the GE fxutc. It's a single cartridge under sink unit. I was surprised to find the water tastes great. I don't know why the Watts would not work. The Watts cartridge is much heavier than the GE. I figured maybe it was loaded with more carbon? Although the GE required buying the plastic under sink unit, the filter itself is half the price of the Watts and it's easier to change. I'm happy now."
5,argenion appreciated,I purchased my first Argenion over 4 years ago at one of the giant hardware stores. Last month it started leaking and found the plastic had cracked at the threads. If it hadn't been for the leak it would still be kicking. I went to both giant hardware stores and learned they no longer carry it. I suspect it's because the Argenion lasts so long they prefer the models that people will come back after 6 months to replace.So I found it on Amazon and quickly purchased another one.My wife is a big time bottled water drinker...she's never complained about the Argenion. As a matter of fact she's been bugging me to get the new one installed already!
1,defective water filter,"I purchased a Watts 5 year water filter for inline use for our refrigerator ice cube maker in June and installed it as per instructions a short time later. In the past couple of weeks we have noticed whitish flakes in our glasses after ice cubes had melted. We verified this by melting cubes in clean glasses. Same result. I contacted Watts and they said to disconnect filter and compare water before it enters the filter to water coming out of the filter. We are on a city water line and have not noticed this in our tap water.So, just a few months after installation of what I thought would last a long time, we have to deal with the filter all over again. I wish I had paid more attention to previous reviews regarding this same issue. Thought it was just an isolated problem. Plus, I'm not sure how much of the white flakes we have ingested before noticing the problem!"
3,Watts Inline Filter - Okay,"After following manufacturer's instructions for breaking in the filter, it worked perfectly for about a week. Now the chlorine taste is back (it is just not as bad as it was before). I found out after I get this from amazon for over $33.08 that The Home Depot sells it for over 15% less and offers a 10% military discount. Overall I am a little bit upset with the pricing as I could have saved five bucks, but fairly satisfied with the product."
1,Watts 5Yr Premier Filter,"This filter leaked its charcoal into the ice-maker ice for about 5 days. The charcoal finally cleared up, but the filter is poorly made - or the quality control is nil."
1,Don't waste your time and money.,"This is a nightmare. We are not novices at home improvement projects. After 6 hours and 2 12 mile trips into town for parts, we give up. Returning it NOW. I would rate it less than one star if I could."
2,Not the product's fault,"Within a month of putting the filter on the icemaker, it was jammed. I guess it did the job of filtering things out of the water, but our water had too much stuff for it to handle. It created a water leak in the line and had to be disconnected and reconnected without the filter to work."
2,Tastes only slightly better than tap water,"I gave it two stars for trying. I don't care how many years or gallons this filter provides, the water tastes only slightly better than San Diego's public water supply (tap water). The Watts filter does eliminate tap water odor and a little of the chlorine taste, but not nearly enough for me. I will be searching for a higher-rated/reviewed filter and give this one away, unless I can return it to the big-box home-improvement store where I purchased it."
1,Doesn't work,"I installed this filter 3 weeks ago into my water line that feeds the ice maker. I previously had a different brand filter that had been working but was getting old and needed to be replaced. After flushing this filter for the recommended amount of time, I let it make some ice. I discarded the first few batches before testing the ice. It is more cloudy and has more white floaties than it did with the old filter. I've never done a review before, but the ineffectiveness of this product caused me to want to warn others. Buy something else and avoid the regret/lost time."
5,THIS CD IS DA BOMB!!!!!,"i recently bought this cd and i think it is really good! no matter what these haters say, if you want a great island cd, with great lyrics, vocals, and beats, BUY THIS ONE!!! i am Polynesian and i don't think any Poly girl can sing like these Micronesian-born & raised chic! she's da bomb and all the rest just alright...."
1,BORING! BORING! BORING!,"THIS CD DOES NOT IMPRESS! THE LYRICS ARE KIND OF BORING, ESPECIALLY REPEATING THE FIRST PART OF EVERY VERSE ON ALL THE SONGS. I GUESS THEY RAN OUT OF WORDS TO THINK OF. BUT, THAT MAKES IT BORING...IT MAKES THIS CD LESS EFFECTIVE THAN IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN."
1,plain and dull,"i'm from the island of hawaii and this album has sweet melody's to it. the only problem is i don't really like the vocalist who sings these songs. she doesn't have the vibe to live it up. Bret Forvargue(the producer) i think on the other did a terrrrific job though. people, you'll only waste your time buying this album cuz you would like to buy a cd that you'd like listening to, over and over again. This album you would get bored with in no time!!! if you do decide to buy it, make sure you don't spend more.... Good luck!"
5,excellent,Very good book for any coach of young players. Breaks down the steps to teaching a young pitcher so the coach can understand and relay the information to the player.
1,Need more that one.,I can't tell you if theses pants are of good quality or not. I have twin grandsons so I need 2 pair of pants; but unless I order 2 different colors it won't let me buy more than one. Bummer!
1,Disapointing,"This album got a lot of hype before it came up, and i was pretty excited because I like T.I.. The problem with this album is that the other 16 tracks that aren't the singles are average, at best. Maybe its just me but listening to T.I. talk hard like a gangster and a thug life after watching him skate around in his movie ATL just isn't cutting it for me. Its actually pretty laughable. If you haven't seen ATL this album will probably be alright for you, but if you have its just a joke. ATL seriously ruined it for me. I cant listen to this guy say anything slightly hard anymore or i just end up laughing. It wasn't just T.I. skating around that ruined this album. The non-single tracks really aren't very good. If you want to buy a cd for two good songs go for it, if not i suggest hitting up the tivo for the music videos. Im severely disapointed with this album."
4,"TI vs TIP, cool but not as good as king","TI is indeed one of the top rappers in the south along with lil wayne. Im a TI fan. I got all 5 of his cd's, but this ain't his best offering. That would go to trap muzik. Some tight cuts on here include dopeman, my type, you know what it is, hurt, watch what you say to me, help is coming,the 1st act with TIP and the 2nd act with TI even though they were both interludes. Touchdown was straight, but a collaboration with eminem, i'd thought it would have been hotter. Big thangs poppin was alright, but not even close to his best 1st single. If you want good southern rap or a TI fan, then cop it, but if you are new to TI then cop trap muzik or im serious first."
1,TI better when he ws diss Flip... going soft,TI is okay when you get right down to it Flip is betterWe Got Next is great.... better yet check out Devin theDude - Smoke Sessions it Hot... Plies Real Definitionsis one to watch... if you are going to byone album this year buy Smoke Sessions
5,T.I. vs alphabet Boyz - check out his homie Devin the Dude,"if you love T.I., check out his homie Devin the Dude Smoke Sessions, Vol. 1- track 3 getting high is something to smoke to - whoah - this is the first album since Rapalot Days and the first album of Devin's to hit the Billboard Charts - Congrats"
2,Very Unhappy with this Album,"I've been a huge T.I. fan from Day one and I have to say this is by far is worst CD. Unlike on his previous CD's were he just happened to make songs that made it on the radio, he's trying too hard to make the radio, club, and street songs, it just doesn't sound natural like the other one's did, plus the lyrics and production are not that great on this, so I have to say I'm not feeling it. There are only four of 5 songs I actually like, and none of them are songs on the radio or video. Please step it up T.I.P. and don't rush anymore CD's"
3,NOT THE KING,"NOT THIS TIME. THIS CD WAS NOT WORTH THE HYPE. I WAITED FOR THE RELEASE DATE AND PURCHASED THE CD THAT MORNING. I HAVE BEEN PLAYING IT EVER SINCE WAITING FOR IT TO GROW ON ME BUT IT HASN'T. THERE ARE THREE SONGS THAT I REALLY LIKE BUT THAT IS IT. T.I. IS GONNA SELL REGARDLESS, HE HAS ALREADY ESTABLISHED HIS SELF SO HE HAS ROOM FOR MISTAKES AND THIS CD WAS JUST THAT , A MISTAKE. HE WILL HAVE 1 MORE BIG SINGLE OFF OF THIS CD, MAYBE 2 BUT THAT'S IT. I LIKE T.I. BUT THIS ONE DIDN'T DO IT FOR ME."
3,good for t.i. fans,"this cd is a very medicore album its definetly not an album u can run through from beginning, in some songs he sounds like he is mubbling and i cant even understand what he is saying their ae some good songs on here but i dont think this cd will change anybody's opinion about him whether it be good or bad"
2,THIS ALBUM IS WEAK!!!!!!!!,"T.I put absolute no effort into this album. The beats are trash, the flow trash, I give it 2 and half stars only because of Em, Jay, and Busta the basically saved the enitre album. T.I. or T.I.P or whatever he calls himself needs to get in a time machine and take it back to 2002-2003 when he dropped ""IN THE STREETS MIXTAPES"" and ""TRAP MUSIK"" and he needs to find himself......PERIOD Of course he'll go Platinum because now he's considered a ""SUPERSTAR"" but with this effort he surely showing that he doesn't care anymore he's just cashing in now....."
4,Rather Nice,"After listening to this a few times it's probably TI's most generic/trash album ever released. Tracks like ""You Know What it Is, Da Dopeman, Watch What You Say to Me, Show it to Me"" and so many others show no real skill and sound like the same street music everyone else sings.Some songs are very strong, and the Act 1 & 2 skits are excellent. Otherwise skip this one and head on to Paper Trail, it's a much better album both skill and content wise."
2,T.I. vs Covers of Songs from the Album King,"Ive loved TI ever since he came out with ""I'm serious"". It has been downhill since then. Ive loved all of his albums except for this particular ""effort."" The reasong being : same beats, weak lyrics, and feeble attempts at classic one liners. See the trend? If the album were full of recycled beats and killer flows from his first effort, an entirely different story. Not the case. Don't buy this before you try this. Thanks friends."
2,I am not pleased....,I am a big FAN of TI. I have all of his CD's and this is the worst one. First off what is the difference between TI and TIP. They are both speaking the same things. He brought the right first single out Big thisngs poppin as this is the best song and lured in sales. I cannot get through the CD no matter how many times I try. Normally things grow on you but I only play tracks 1- an interlude and 2. I do like the song My Type but that is about it. I love TI but this CD is not good at all.
3,average at best,I agree with the last review... there are only 4-5 tracks that are worth listening too and the rest are sub par. This cd should have ended with track 9.
5,T.I. V.S. T.I.P.,T.I. GREATEST ALBUM IN THE WORLD. HE IS THE BEST RAPPER EVER POINT BLANK PERIOD. HE IS THE BEST MALE RAPPER TO EVER RAP. VERY GREAT ALBUM IF YOU DO NOT HAVE IT THEN GO GET IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,T.I. vs The Leak,If you're a T.I. fan save your money on this one and check out his collabo with DJ Drama. Both boys get down and dirty in the ATL and know they've leaked some good tracks with the The Leak Unloaded.
2,Umm.. did I really buy this?,"I have all the respect in the world for T.I., but his other four albums were much better than this new release. To put it bluntly.. burn it, enough said."
2,"Tip's a ""little"" off on this one","T.I. has been calling himself the ""King of the South"" for as long as I can remember but this effort has him rethinking that title. His 2006 release, ""King"", was an album designed to be the highlight of his carrer as stated by himself in an XXL Magazine interview but T.I. vs T.I.P. isn't a good follow up. The album seems like it's more of an unreleased project made from a record company just to make more money. The album feels like a bunch of tracks clumped together with advertisement behind it. Songs like ""My Type"" and ""Watch What You Say To Me"" are the only notable songs on the disk while ""Help is Coming"" has you thinking if T.I. really knows what Hip Hop is."
4,Different but good,"This CD is an attempt to add a little depth to a rapper that has had success with everything else. The beats and lyrics are all up to par, nothing too exciting but nothing horribly bad either. I don't think too many people can complain with the appearances...although Eminem's track was a little weak. (I like the Busta comment, its like everyone is still hanging on one Nas line. Doubtful Rhymes is murdering anyone, if it wasn't for Dre & Aftermath he probably wouldn't even be on this CD.)A good CD all the way around, certainly worth the $10-15 to buy it or the time to download it. Not the best CD but it also is by far not the worst. Just get it and stop hating on T.I. already."
2,T.I and TIP tag team a weak album,"I've been listening to this album since it leaked two weeks ago and it still is extremely weak to me. The beats are boring and as usual TI (and TIP) have that same annoying monotone voice. Not only is the voice monotone but the lyrics he is spitting are weak. Eminem, busta rhymes, and Jay-Z make appearances on the album just to display how poor of a lyricist TI (and TIP) are. On each of the songs they appear, they embarass the so called ""king of the south"". There are maybe three songs on this album out of the 18 listed. The one song that does stand out lyrically and the track is dope, is the last song MY TYPE."
4,Beautiful!,This is a beautiful piece. The picture shows it to be a topaz but it's really an amethyst. Since the price was so reasonable the amethyst was not the best quality so I took it to a jeweler and had it replaced. It is now very striking and unique.
5,One of the best bauls ever!,I heard Purna Das back in 1975 and fell in love with Baul music on the spot. I own one of the original LPs which also has a detailed meaning of his songs. It is absolutely awesome. I can't wait to get my hands on the CD.
3,"Pretty, but not comfortable","I bought these because they were a great price & I was in the market for a pair of brown dress shoes. They looked cute and comfortable, with a heel that wasn't overly high. When I wore them the first time I found them very uncomfortable. I don't know if it's the rounded shape of the toe or if they run short, but my toe kept rubbing on the front of the shoe. It was so bad that I had to stop at Macy's while I was out & buy another pair of shoes to get through the day. Hopefully I can sell them to someone at work."
2,To big,This is way to large for my Land Rover I have to push the bumper up just to fit it in the tailor hitch hole.Make sure you know how big a clearance you have before buying this item.
5,Cross Hitch Cover,"I really like this hitch cover! It was hard to find the cross and how I wanted it, but as always Amazon comes through! I love the design and of course the price!"
2,Songs arranged by Dr Wong,If you want the correct chords don't buy this book. The melodies are usually accurate. I'll Remember April is presented with chords that were never played by any known musician. But Richard Rogers' songs perhaps suffer the most damage. There are way too many non-jazz songs.
5,GRAVES COUNTRY,Graves has crafted a batch of delightful scenes and sentiments of the heart to hold on to and to visit with now and again. Well done.
4,Perfect for a Cup of Tea,"This spoon is perfect for a single cup of tea, which is what I wanted. It's easy to clean and while a few leaves get loose, it's not a big deal and kind of unavoidable. It even arrived earlier than expected. I don't think it will last forever but it was cheap, so that's fine. Good so far!"
1,"not good , looks very weak , bad welds","defiantly expecting a larger capacity and at LEAST a lightly constructed build. the welds to the spoon part are not even sub par , if that part was attached properly you could use it for 10 years or so. i expected A lot more. i may return it."
2,Good for Large Tea Leafs,This is great for larger tea leaves but not small as they slip thru the edges and holes and end up floating about in your tea cup. I don't recommend unless you use large tea leaves.
4,Maison Puce,"Alice and her fellow residents in the 'Maison Puce' in Nice are hilarious. There's Hope and her infamous personality, Imogen's sarcastic tongue and mysterious behaviour and Josette the French friend who provides her insights into these English women. Alice is the protaganist in the story, newly divorced and looking to start her life over in a new place after two children and a demanding husband. I loved her, she does what I would like to do one day-take off and live my life in my way, for a divorced mother in her 50's she shows courage and proves that impulsiveness is not just for the young.This is a lovely story, funny and fascinating. Thoroughly enjoyable."
2,not what I expected,"The book has quite a few of the classic masterpieces which are nice to see in 1 volume...the title is off the mark. I expected to be reading an art historians observations relative to each painting, but what I read was more of a history lesson from the time of the paintings execution. Very unhappy"
3,Paintings of events that changed the world,"I don't have a copy of the book with me, so this is going to very general.I was intrigued as to how a painting could change the world (outside of the art world) so I was quite looking forward to this book.I found the paintings selected to be an interesting mix as was the analysis and information about the paintings. However, while there were a few paintings which I would agree had changed the world, for the most part, I would describe the paintings as paintings of events that changed the world, rather than the paintings themselves changing the world."
4,A magical collection of timeless childhood favorites!,"This video has 60 minutes of nursery rhymes that come to life in a pop-up book style mixed with live children or animated puppets. It is a great video for toddlers to age 7. It is amazing how many nursery rhymes it contains -- many of them I had forgotten. Don't expect a lot of bells and whistles, special effects, etc. It is a simple, well produced video equivalent to someone reading or singing to a child. My kids sit for the whole hour and I recommend it highly."
5,Old world charm,"If there is one video that is timeless, it is this! My children, in their teens now, were addicted to this old world charm. My older one, who was a fussy eater, happily gulped his meals while entranced by these rhymes! I have gifted this to several kids. Makes a perfect Birthday gift for toddlers. Distinctly British, the video holds a great appeal to people around the globe.It's a pity this collection is becoming scarce. This is a must for every generation of kids, present and future."
2,BE AWARE,"This vidios compilation is""OK"" But has technical deficiency. It has not continuos play or ""play all vidios"" capability. What that means tha you have to play vidio by vidio all through. And everytime you see one of then return to the bigining main screen."
2,Noisy hissing RO,"This unit replaced an older RO that was no longer functioning properly. My major complaint is the loud hissing/gurgling as the tank fills. It goes on for hours even if you only remove a quart of water from the tank. I have a tiny house with the living room and kitchen open. I have to schedule when I use this RO so it fills up when I'm not in that area. The unit was professionally installed and I have been unable to reach the company to make a complaint. My water pressure is adequate. If it were not so expensive to do, I would have it replaced with some other unit."
1,DO NOT BUY! This is way too noisy.,"The noise it makes filling up even when you use just a little water goes on for hours. Ridiculous. I am about to have the plumber rip this one out an install another. When hearing this noise I ask my self ""Then why did I go to all the trouble trying to find a quiet dishwasher."""
4,Excellent water quality,"I installed the WP5-50 system about a month ago and would like to share the following with people who are considering buying the product: 1) the water quality is really excellent as seen in test paper, 2) it does make some noises when making water but not that bad if you are far enough away from the system, 3) the instructions are not very clear as they include information not for this model as well and it lacks an overall picture of the system installation in my opinion, thus 4 stars; and last but not least 4) in case you already have a copper tube for your ice maker, do not connect the copper tube to the faucet directly since it will ruin the water quality and defeat the whole purpose. Always connect the plastic tube to the faucet and split the tube to the ice maker tube."
5,Best of the bunch,"My mom has one brand of Reverse Osmosis, my sister got a 2nd brand, and I got the Watts. Mine is the best of the bunch -- the faucet is sturdy, and looks good, the water output is strong and fast, and the installation was the simplest.Watts is the best RO system that I've seen (in this unscientific sampling of 3 separate systems)"
2,Plastic fittings broke!!,Plastic fittings broke making it impossible to repair. This after only 7 years. And I had just bought new filters. The fit up should have been designed to be easily fixed. So I had to junk the whole thing and I had just bought new filters.
1,Bad experience,"We had our Watts R-O mounted under the kitchen sink. One of the canisters burst and resulted in very major water damage - on the main floor and in the basement underneath. It cost us more than $3,500 to get the house dried out and habitable. A very bad experience! We sent them two mailings with photographs demanding they step up to cover our loss but heard not a word back."
5,Omgosh..,Wow - you should have seen the junk that was left in the filters of this unit. It's disgusting to think we were drinking that. I will never drink regular water ever again! Just pour a glass and compare it to a glass of tap water. The chlorine smell will gross you out from the tap water. The water from the unit- pristine!!!!!
5,Tastes Delicious,"Great RO system with a really good price, couldn't find it any cheaper especially with Amazons free shipping! Took about 2 hours to install. I'm not a plummer and hate working on anything that might leak but this was pretty easy. Everything is included in the box, (except the tools). They even include a water test strip so that you can check for Nitrate/Nitrite levels. Drinking a lot more water now because of the great taste."
1,It's leaking!!!,in the top of 4th filter it's leaking!!! I don't if I should replace or just return and forgot about the WATS system WP-5... Let's see what customer service will say...
1,Too much noise!,"We were very excited to install and use the filter system for our well water. The installation went fine, the storage tank does take up space underneath the sink area. But the noise, we were not expecting. After the initial fill up and subsequent refills to settle the charcoal dust, we were ready to go. Each time the tank needs to refill you hear the trickle of water down the drain, 4 gallons of water is processed to make 1 gallon of filtered water. Plus a hissing noise similiar to a pressure cooker until it refills. We called Watts, and while they were very friendly, the rep. agreed ""Yes, it is noisy."" No solution was offered. We decided the cons outweighed the pros and uninstalled the system and sent it back. Had we known about the noise and the amount of waste water, we would not have purchased."
2,Beware: Cheap plastic fittings,"Installation wasn't that hard, but Watts used cheap plastic fittings for the connections, so expect a lot of leaks as you set it up. I would gladly pay more if Watts would supply quality brass parts that don't leak. They mention to ""tighten with a wrench, but don't tighten too much or the fitting will break"".... come on!?!."
5,Easy To Install 1 Missing Part Thoug,"I Got This R/O deliver and one day got here at 10:00 at 12:00 I was flushing the water thas how easy its to install....There Was 1 missing part a little plastic seal for adapt-a-valve..,but there was this 2 little seal plastic caps on polishing filter in each end make a hole and the middle and used them as 1 seal cap it's all good now..other than that its great product"
1,Not what was expected,"Bigelow stopped making their Green Tea with Mango in Iced Tea sized pouches, so was looking for substitute mango iced tea and ordered Walters Bay Ceylon Premium Iced Tea, Mango Flavored. What arrived was product that was made in 2006 with the expiration date coming up, brewed very dark and what might be said somewhat bitter, even when diluted in half and cut down brewing time; not the taste I was seeking as another reviewer of a non-Biglow Mango Tea had mentioned."
5,An all time classic,"From the masters of the finite element method, this may well be the best book ever written on the subject. In this book, the authors come across as the sages of ancient India preaching what they know is the best, guiding us, and setting a stage of research for the years to come. This is a monumental piece of work in the history of engineering."
4,ABBY COMMENTS,"Me gustó porque la telenovela es excelente. Pero este dvd aunque lleva la trama bastante completa, quien ha visto la novela siente que faltaI like it because Corazon Salvaje is an excelent tv production. Although the dvd has been well edited, who has seen the complete serie felt like a lot is missing."
1,Demasiado resumida la novela/ too condensed,"Ya he comprado una dozena de novelas en DVD, y Corazon Salvaje me ha dejado decepcionada.Las demas tienen de 12 a 14 horas de duracion, que aunque resumida, si contienen toda la historia de los protagonistas.En Corazon Salvaje hay menos de 5 horas y le cortan partes super importantes, incluyendo las magnificas discusiones de Aimee con Dona Sofia.Realmente no vale la pena esta seleccion en video.I have purchased dozens of soap operas in DVD and Corazon Salvaje has left me disappointed.Other shows are 12 to 14 hours long, whereas, even when they are abridged selections, they do include all of the story about the main characters.Corazon Salvaje is less than 5 hours long, and major parts of the story have been left out, including the fights between Aimee and Sofia.This selection is really not worth it."
3,corazon salvaje,esta es una de mis novelas preferidas.edith gonzalez y eduardo palomo me encantan.pero quede bastante decepcionada con el resumen .le cortaron demasiado tanto que la historia no tiene sentido.la novela tiene solamente un disco no dura ni 300 minutos lo que hace imposible un buen resumen de una novela que duro 80 capitulos.es una pena porque la historia en si es muy bonita.
4,i love it,"creo que es de las mejores novelas que TELEVISAS a trasmitido en toda el tiempo , ademas ellos son de las pocos artistas que quedan en TELEVISA que se les creen de la manera que actuan , que pena aver perdido a un actor de la taya de Eduardo Palomo."
3,great telenovela but only 280 minutes,"I watched corazon salvaje 14 years ago and i was thrilled.Since then i din't find on tv something comparable.Now i had the opportunity to own this dvd but i found out that so many lovable scenes were cut.Anyway,it's better than nothing and for those who search something so romantic this dvd must be added in their collection."
3,Corazon,"The DVD product is good. However, this is a condensed version of the novela and skips over many good parts in the original. I was a little disappointed in this!"
2,Pésima edición,"compre el CD para que mi madre disfrutara de sus novelas favoritas. Cuando me comenta que la novela fue editada de tal forma que ella la entiende porque la vio pocos días atrás. Y lo comprobé al ver los primeros minutos del CD, no pude seguir la historia por no conocerla."
3,es un resumen corto de toda la novela,"Esta novela es mi favorita por muchas razones, lastimosamente este dvd es un resumen de toda la novela escogiendo solo los momentos importantes de la misma. Lástima!!!/This novel is my favorite for many reasons, unfortunately this dvd is a summary of all the novel by choosing only the most important moments of it. Too bad!"
2,Disapointed,"It was great to was this ""novela"" after so many years!! It is, by all means, much better than the current version (which is quite scary). However, they chopped it off way too much to be able to fit it in one DVD. It would have been much better to buy more than one DVD."
3,Corazon Salvaje movie version,"It appears this ""movie"" was made by editing the television novel, since the action jumps periodically, giving the impression that some parts have been eliminated. Also, the theme song is never sung in its entirety, another sign that quite a bit was edited out. This is understandable since even with the editing, the movie runs some 4 hours. However, that should have been noted in the description. This movie is better than nothing but I will hope to find the entire telenovela. Also, there is a defect on the DVD that caused the last minute or two to lose the action and dialog. When I cleaned the disc, hoping it was just a speck of dirt, the problem actually grew to include more of the disc."
3,DVD Corazon Salvaje,"This is my favorite telenovela of all times. I loved the plot, the actors, the scenes, everything. However the DVD, as other reviewers have pointed out, is a very very condensed version. You can understand the plot but there are so many good scenes that were cut to be able to fit the story in 1 DVD, some of them very romantic scenes between Juan and Monica. That's the reason I give it a 3 stars. But other than that, I enjoyed watching the DVD."
4,very short version,just for people who already saw it on TV and loved it. for first time wachers it is missing all the passion and suspense.
5,Great!!,"I love Corazon Salvaje, This is my fav. soap opera. I was glad to find it here. Great price and great product. I love Ana Colchero, Edith Gonzalez and Eduardo Palomo (R.I.P.)."
1,Not as good as I expected,"I've seen the ""novela"" on TV, and it was not what I expected. Certain details were not on the DVD, which I think they were important, since it developed the characters itselves. I am not happy with it and would not recommended well enough."
4,"It is good, but it is too short","It is a complete review, but I guess it goes too fast. You live emotion after emotion, and unfortunately each scene does not last too long. I like it because it resumes the novela fairly."
4,corazon salvaje-580 MIN .I RECEIVED 280MIN,"I CLICK IN IMAGE DVD TELENOVELA CORAZON SALVAJE-580MIN,2 DOUBLES DISC.I RECEIVED 1 DISC,280 MIN TELENOVELA CORAZON SALVAJE.WHY?BEAUTIFUL IMAGES,BUT 280 MIN.NOT 580 MIN..."
2,Interesting but,"This book was way too deep into the past and present culture of Tibetan Buddhism in relation to the Dakini. I was looking for something different and did not like the energy of the book and what it implied in regards to how Dakini are ""born"" in modern times. It excluded other cultures and yes I know it's tibetan Buddhism , but I thought it would show and teach about the Dakini in a different manner."
2,Cosmic Heterosexual Hegemony?,Book is okay. It avoids some very difficult questions such as what if one is not a heterosexual practitioner?
3,Interesting underside of Buenos Airies,"You won't often see Buenos Airies portrayed in movies, so this gritty little street drama offers a special look at one of the world's great cities. The plot is minimal: four teenage thugs scratch out a low grade living robbing cab passengers until they decide to go for bigger prey. Nothing much happens and the dialogue subtitles are mostly four letter words and macho posturing. In the end, a couple get shot in a shootout and the movie is over. Doesn't sound like much, but it's very watchable."
4,Here's How Good This Stuff Is...,"Despite incredibly high amounts of sodium and ungodly amounts of heartburn...I still eat at least 3 cans of this stuff a week regardless of how terrible it makes me feel. Is that an addiction issue? At any rate, this stuff is good."
5,SO SCORCHING ITS HEARTWARMING,"If you like it dynamic, thunderous, and inspirational, a la Fugazi, buy this CD! This band absolutely kicks ..."
2,all glitz,"These lures are some of the most appealing looking I have ever seen. But, upon retrieve they flip over and loose their action, hydroplaning across the surface."
3,It helped some.,"I had no idea how to buy a used car and this book helped with a tidbit here and there. It didn't help all that much, but I got a few ideas."
5,can't do better,"i am a 58 year old los angeles attorney. i know how to negotiate and figure deals. i know how to find dealers' costs from other sources. i always thought i outsmarted the dealers in my previous purchases and leases. then when recently leasing a car i decided to double check myself against some of the books on the subject. there are many and i bought bragg's book by chance and two others for comparison. YOU don't have to bother. Bragg's is all you need. i learned in 45 minutes how much i didn't know about buying and leasing, and by the time i was done with the process i KNOW i got the best deal available and no wool was pulled over my eyes this time."
5,"Better than other two books, I used it step-by-step to save at least a $1000","I always felt intimidated in buying a car, so I bought this book with Edmund's Smart Car Buyer and Bob Elliston's What Car Dealers won't tell you to educate myself. This book was definitely the most useful. While I like the ""Confessions of a Car Salesman"" last chapter of the Edmund's book to get incite on the day to day of selling cars, this book had more context about automobile sales market and more practical tips on buying and selling a car while getting the best price. Chapter 19 on the ""fax attack"" was a step by step guide on how to get the lowest price possible (it would probably work just as well with email to these days.) I did exactly what it said and bought my car (2007 RAV4) for $900 below invoice after 15 competing dealers balked at the best bid. Gave me great peace of mind that I got best deal possible and really handled all the particulars of each step of the process."
2,Bukowski It's Not,"Being an avid Bukowski fan I ordered this ""book"". It's really a small pamphlet stapled together, with print on the front calling the author a literary genius. It's basically about a Bukowski fan who wants to get laid, but can't drink beer (or write) so he adds sugar to his beer to make it palatable. Obviously he never gets laid or finishes a beer. This summary is better than the book and more entertaining. Cheers!"
3,"""In The Pit"" Book Review","While ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper's wild over-the-top ring persona made him one of my favorite wrestlers of all-time, ""In The Pit With Piper"" was somewhat of a dissapointing read for me. Piper spends a good portion of the book overplaying his role in the first Wrestlemania while underplaying those of Vince McMahon and Hulk Hogan. There are a lot of great angles and incidents that Piper was involved in that get no mention in this book and the usually-witty Hot Rod comes off kind of dry here. Piper's horror stories about the darker side of the squared circle are the highlight of this book as he details the pressures that face pro wrestlers and pays tribute to his fallen comrades who fell victim to ""The Sickness"". ""In The Pit With Piper"" is a decent read but I was expecting a lot more from a Roddy Piper autobiography."
3,An Embellished and Obviously Ghostwritten bio of the Hot Rod,"As a obnoxious young teenager during the early-to-mid 80's Roddy Piper was Pure Gold. I do believe he belongs up there with Vinny Mac and Hogan as the three people who put the WWF on the map.Unfortunately, while the content of the book is good, the delivery is not. The book does not read as if it came from the mouth of Piper. It reads as if it came from a ghostwriter who knows nothing about wrestling. Mick Foley has set the bar high as far truth and honesty goes in an autobiography. Also, I just can't believe half the stories that are in this book."
5,Best book i read by a wrestler.....if not the best book ever,"If your think about buying this book then buy it cause I myself dont like reading but when I started to read this book I couldn't stop. He really does paint a picture for you like you wouldn't believe. He shares stories you just can't make up it. I feel like I know the guy personal. If you want to know more about Roddy Piper or how life is as a pro wrestler, then take my word for it this is the book for you."
4,From Wrestling to Sport entertainment,"Piper's book make for a fast read and educating insight into the wrestling world. It helps seeing the emergence of WWF through the wrestler's eyes rather than through the promoter's as was mostly the case in Shaun Assael's book.Some affirmations by Piper sounded presumptuous but I will leave to the Meltzers of this world the task of critizing the accuracy of the book since I don't have the knowledge to do so.I enjoyed reading it for that frank and honest look at the world of wrestling and at the changes that happened with the rise of WWF. It is also nice to learn about all the other wrestlers through Piper's account of his interaction with them.Chapter 12 is particularly interesting since Piper takes head-on what he calls ""the sickness"": the overwhelming bearing on the life of wrestlers that wrestling has, mainly because of the promoters manipulations and the lifestyle according to him.It is definatly worth reading."
3,Decent,"I have always been a huge Piper fan and grew up watching him. I've probably read this book 5 or 6 times over the years and always enjoy it, but it is very one sided. You would think Piper was the only wrestler besides Hogan that drew a dime over the years. Piper claims to have been the main draw wherever he wrestled and that simply isn't true. He manages to make just about every significant event in the entire wrestling world about him. In my opinion, he was too popular and made too much money to be so bitter. Good book though. I always enjoy re-reading it."
4,Hot Rod can write,A wrestler you loved to hate and a man you couldn't not love and respect. I had the opportunity to meet Roddy and have him sign my book.A great read and an insight to the mind and life of those who choose to wrestle. The many men who met an early demise due to this activity. I highly recommend for anyone who grew up watching professional wrestling.
4,Wrestling War Stories From Poppa Piper,"An entertaining collection of stories from a true legend who has made wrestling his life's work and relied on more than luck to stay successful.I have read several wrestling autobiographies back to back including those by Freddie Blassie, Jimmy Hart and Jerry Lawler, but I found this one to be the most honest and enjoyable to read. Piper speaks with true sincerity about the job and co-workers/family that saved him from living on the street, although it seems he ended up living an even more extreme life in the wrestling world.Piper waxes philosophical on the business of wrestling, but throws in enough raunchy/violent stories from the road keep the reader's interest peaked. No one gets a free pass as Piper shares his opinions on Hulk Hogan, Vince McMahon, Jr. and Randy Savage among others.Fun read and cheap too!"
4,Good,This book was new as expected it was definitely a good buy for me. I would recommend it to anyone.
3,Remove the fingerings,"After growing up on John Thompson and eventually becoming a music teacher, I recently revisited this book. Although somewhat dated the pieces are well-written, musical and fast paced by today's standards. Some of the information about the composers and pieces was informative for young students. I have only one complaint but it is a major one. FINGERINGS!! Why did he find it necessary to put a finger number under every note in the book? This, as any experienced teacher knows, simply encourages students to play by finger numbers rather than learning the notes. I now use the book for sight reading and have solved the finger number problem. Eliminating about 90% of the fingerings with a bottle of white out seems to do the trick. Buy the book, but don't forget the white out."
5,Super,"Very nice book.Easy and bright.What I like the most, you start playing properly straight away.Love it."
5,KEEPING YOUR INTEGRITY WHILE GROWING A SUCCESSFUL COMPANY,"If you've been thinking of starting a business, but you feeluncomfortable with the ""business"" part, or if your existingbusiness isn't growing, but you find most marketing materialsa little sleazy, I highly recommend this book. Sullivan,once an exec at Bank of America, was a ""business guru"" forcompanies like THE WHOLE EARTH CATALOG; he helped manydiscover that they could do what they loved, provideexcellent service, and still earn the profits needed to keepa business thriving. The book is well-written, with adetailed explanation of ""TradeSkill"" and why it's importantto any honest business. If you have pride of craft and wantto turn it into a self-sufficient business, you'll find thisa very helpful book. I've given away about 50 copies inthe last ten years, and worn out three of my own: it's a greatresource. --Duif Calvin"
4,Fun read,"I lived in Provincetown as a child, it was fun reading about the history. It's a charming little fishing village/ artist colony/ tourist attraction."
5,Don't Miss This One - Would Make a Great Gift!,"Extremely well written, with interesting characters and vivid descriptions of the old west, this novel is thoroughly enjoyable.A story of courage, strength, dedication, ability to overcome obstacles, friendship, forgiveness, and love, Incident at Copper Creek, portrays the American characteristics that the west was built upon and that we still admire and value today.I read the first half on a plane. I couldn't put it down. I kept reading in the taxi and finished it that night.I hope that there will be a sequel. I would love to know what is in store next for Marshall Trace Hawthorne and Lane Carter.But, whether a sequel to Incident at Copper Creek, another western, or something of a completely different genre, I won't miss Michael Senuta's next novel!"
1,Item arrived without the lid,The item arrived in a package ( box ) that appeared to have been opened & used. The lid was not included in the package. Paid a lot for this product on line due to needing it for a retirement party and gift presentation. Was disappointed with the end result.
1,Not worth it,"Since this is a publication by the ACSA, most of the helpful tips on how to apply and how to go about choosing a school are available for free on the association's website. The information on individual schools seems to have been culled directly from each respective school's website. There's no overall editorial rating of schools, rather you'll have to extrapolate its reputation from its acceptance rate (many schools have this metric marked NA). In my view, this book is only good if you're too lazy to do some of your own due diligence on schools you're interested in. There's not much added value to purchasing this book."
4,One of the best duos,"After I heard Tu Principe with Daddy Yankee and Zion y Lennox(Barrio Fino CD),I decided to check out Zion y Lennox albums and decided to buy it. I wasn't disappointed this is one of the best CDs I have heard from start to end,if you want a hot CD thats going to get the party started this is it. The CD gets started with infectious songs like Don't Stop and Bandida Remix and continues with hits like Estas Tentandome y Guaya, Guaya Rompe Cintura my favorites off the CD. Zion y Lennox Motivando A La Yal is a great asset to anyone's CD collection."
2,"Canciones decentes, pero suenan iguales todas","Yo los habia oido en Eddie Dee 12 discipulos y Lunytun Mas Flow, y me gusto mucho el sabor que ponian en esas canciones. Pero lo que encontre con este disco fue que todo sonaba casi igual. Mi problema es que las mezclas de las canciones son muy parecidas, el mismo tipo de bajo, ritmo, etc. se encuentra en casi todas. Simplemente no se compara a Tego Calderon o Don Omar."
4,For the Reggaeton Lovers this is the CD,I have heard a lot of reggaeton cd's that have come out and this one is one of the best ones. It has all different kinds of beats and amazing baselines. On some reggaeton cd's all the songs sound the same but Zion and Lennox mix it up. If you buy this CD you will be happy with your choice.
2,Dated and one-sided,"Research into the tradition of women deacons--known in Christendom since Phoebe the deacon (Romans 16:1--has generally focussed on the question of whether they were sacramentally ordained. Both before and after Martimort's study, written in response to a earlier work published by Roger Gryson, scholars have determined that women deacons were actually ordained and are still ordained in some Orthodox Churches. Despite excellent work by Kalsbach (1926), Meyer (1938), Gryson (1972), Fitzgerald (1999) and Zagano (2000), the 2002 International Theological Commission study document on the diaconate depends primarily on Martimort's perspective. A comparison between Gryson and Martimort will find they use the same materials, interpreting them differently. Martimort's book is valuable only in the sense of tracing the history of modern attempts to discredit the ordained women of history."
4,Comprehensive reference,"This excellent reference of art terms is a must for readers and students of Western, Near East and Oriental art history. It covers most of the terminology used by artists and historians from the Middle Ages forward and includes some useful illustrations. Its only flaw appears to be the desire to cover terms used in 20th century art, where it is less comprehensive. In my opinion, if you're going to cover a period, do it well or don't do it at all. Better to spend the effort to make the book excel at something than be all things to all readers. Couple this volume with the Artspoke/Artspeak duo and you're well covered through undergrad and most of grad school."
2,Hoping for Better,"Well unlike the other reviwers I didn't like this book too much. I found the first book a little more interesting. This book should be renamed to the Pennington Series, because that is mostly what this book focuses on is the Pennington characters. I just don't find this series interesting at all, and I prefer the University series. I wonder how much longer this series will go on, hopefully not too much longer. The Elizabeth and Max storyline bored me to tears. I could care less about Sarah and Nick. Vanessa is the only character in my opinion who is slightly interesting. By the way Sarah and Nick's storyline is a lot like the one that dealt with Elizabeth and her decision about whether or not to lose you know what (if you read the storylines in the last couple of University books you will know what I'm referring too). Plus Sarah annoys me. I don't know if I will bother to buy the other books in this series."
1,a most unfortunate turn of events,"This series is simply a hybrid of old SVH/SVU, and a reworking of an earlier trilogy (from SVH) when Liz and Jess stay at some castle, and Liz has a little romance. Remember? Where is SVU? Are we being punished because sales were low? I don't want to read only about Liz, and forget about Chloe and all the new developments that were built up right at the end. I am not interested in this London business. It would be much more interesting if Liz were at the University of London rather than the basement of some ridiculous castle. I won't be buying any more Sweet Valley anything until Sweet Valley University comes back. And I am not the only one. Check out bn's page. Its fine if Elizabeth stays a series for those who care, but SVU needs to come back"
5,"Well, it's definitely a change . . .","I thought that this book, and this series (so far) was/is interesting, and a nice change of pace . . . the characters seem real, and the storylines allow for fantasy, but also reality. We get to see an Elizabeth most people haven't. . . think about it. She's defying her parents and stepping away from Jessica for the first time. I kind of think it's a little strange that Francine should name one of the characters Nick . . (hehe . ., although this Nick seems nothing like the ""Nick Fox"", hint, hint) I want back in the series! (that was a nice little, um, addition.) Seriously, Vanessa is a cool character, Mary seems very demanding, and Elizabeth seems to really have a thing for Max . . .I'd love to see her back at SVU, but maybe this little trip away from home is meant to make all of our SVU characters realize what they are missing, and give them the desire to get it back . . . you never know!!"
4,"Ok,it's not bad afterall","Yeah,I know i dissed the first book here but when I read the second book 'cause I was bored to death,it's great afterall.It's definitely more interesting than the first one.It shows more of the characters.Elizabeth's more happy now,working as a maid.But the Sarah part was way too much.I can't wait for the next book."
4,The Press!,"My opion about this game was it was fun. I mean, I use to be a big fan of this game, but then over the years it kinda got ok. Because at first, I couldn't that game for nothing, getting frustrated at it & all that. But it became fun later on, and I enjoy it."
3,"Okay quality, not professional grade","I bought these because a previous reviewer said that the wire was solid copper. Either the model changed since that review or that reviewer was incorrect. These are decent quality cables, the clamps are sturdy enough, but the wire is definitely copper coated aluminum. It didn't occur to me to check the shipping weight, but when I picked up the box, I could tell that 20 foot, 4 gauge solid copper cables with heavy duty clamps should be heavier than 6.3 pounds. I haven't decided whether it is worth sending them back or if they are good enough to put in the wife's car."
5,Already had to use it - Amazing,"Don't buy cheap jumper cables, you will be lucky to jump your car. If you do actually successfully jump the car with cheap (thin) cables, it will take who knows how many minutes of running the other car at 2,000 RPMs. With these, it was instant. I will never buy cheap cables again!! The only down side (not that big of a deal), is that these are rather heavy (which makes sense since they are way thinker than the cheap ones i had before)."
4,solid construction,i didn't realize that the color differentiation did not carry through to the cable itself. My bad. Not sure if the parrot clips are more effective.
4,Car radio for the Ages,I wanted an car radio/CD and cassette player.I am happy with purchase. Unfortunately it does not have a carousel for more than one CD. A bit difficult to work it but that usually takes time.
3,"Nice Size, Cheap Construction","It's really a nice size hitch cover, Only problem I have is how it's made, it's not one solid piece. The base and cover meet and are held together by 4 screws which really sucks, I use my truck offroad from time 2 time. I could have made a custom cover with an old hitch reciver myself, that would have been sturdier. In which I honestly plan on doing and one solid heavy piece. If you want it for just style and you do not plan on going off-road it will do."
1,like paper,"This outfit isn't worth the trouble even if it was FREE. It was ruined on day-one. I wouldn't purchase from this company again, as I doubt this isn't their only poor quality item."
2,Cute but poor quality,"Like other people who bought this outfit, we had the same problem where the pants ripped on the inseam. I had bought 2 of these costumes for 2 my nephews since they love playing soldiers. Within the first 5 minutes of wearing it, the inseam ripped on one of the pants and all he did was walk around the house in it. The second pair lasted a day before the same thing happened. My mom had stitched the pants back up for the boys and so far everything still seems intact. They really love the outfits so I hope it last a little longer."
2,Not much overhang,"I purchased the complete bedding from Amazon, plus bed sheets and a decorative pillow. My daughter has a full size bed, which I believe is standard size. It does not have a pillow-top mattress.I was disappointed to find that the comforter does not have much coverage on the sides. Granted I purchased it knowing the dimensions, but I didn't think to measure. I never had any trouble fitting ""full"" comforters to my beds before.I was tempted to return everything, but my I'll try to live with the shortcomings (no pun intended). I might have to buy a blanket to go a little beyond the side edges in case I am constantly seeing the mattress and am being driven crazy by it.I went onto JC Penney web site, and their fulls are all about 4"" wider than the Crayola comforter. FYI"
5,Inside the Philadelphia Orchestra,"A touching, informative look at the individuals who make up the Philadelphia Orchestra. Anyone who loves classical music, or any kind of music, will find this film to be exceptional. Learning about the wide-interests of an orchestra's members is extremely appealing. The music that is heard is beautiful."
5,Philadelphia Orchestra movie,"I saw this movie in the theater when it first came out, and I knew I had to have it. It was so moving and insightful, I walked on air as I headed home. As a musician, it reminded me of why I do what I do. I watch it over and over."
5,Very rugged,I bought this lever to do some extreme brake testing on my antilock brake system for bicycles. The lever worked all the time even under heavy lever load conditions. It is very rugged and affordable.
3,They Work!,"These levers are cheap, but I really needed new ones to stick on my new drop bars. I mostly ride on the hoods and these are sufficiently comfortable. The materials are pretty cheap, but they work and I can't see them breaking any time soon."
5,Great Brakes for an older bike!,"Rebuilding a 10 speed i got for free and wasnt wanting to spend any large amounts of cash on it, got these because i wasnt really worried about 8 bucks, turns out they work wonderfully! Look real sharp on the bike and used black handle bar tape so it just fit right in. Very very pleased!"
3,Don't fit properly.,"Not sure if it's just my road handlebars, but I needed to shim these to get them to fit properly. Even tightened all the way, there was still a lot of play. Used a cut up old tube for a shim and works fine now. Product itself works well as a cheap, no-nonsense lever."
2,STINKER.,"Bought this at a local garage sale last saturday! For only $1.00 which was $.75 cents more than it was worth,but what the hey,I got an OLD free lawn mower for the taking soo it was vey well worth my time. Pass on these remake wedding song's."
4,"Useful, competent compendium","This brief compendium of biographical enties on major and minor pulp writers is interesting and illuminating. It has just about the right amount of photographs, and some of them are rare. This volume is not as indipensable a starting point for research as it would have been before ithe nternet, wikipedia, and all the new online pulp studies. But this book is useful, easy to use, and fun to read. It is far from able to serve as an excyclopedia, or to deserve that name. I'd like to see it expanded on a regular schedule, and also cover the pulp artists who contributed so much to the pulp experience. This is a pleasant contribution to the growing field of pulp studies. Modest but very nicely done."
2,A misguided venture,"Why would an author who believes Sam Spade to have been created by Raymond Chandler (page 62) bother to write about pulp fiction writers? And, more to the point, why would you bother to read him?There is little actual information in the book, except for generalities, brief plot synopses and more or less widely available biographical data. There are a few interesting snippets here and there about some lesser figures, but they are hardly worth your 20 bucks."
3,Remington HC-600 HC600 High Precision 18 Piece Washable Hair Clipper Kit with Nano Silver Cutting System,"Its good, I like the power of the other slick remington and it costs the same."
4,HC-600,"This clipper works very well. I've had it for about 6 months. I like being able to rinse off the blades instead of banging it on the sink (which caused my previous clipper to break).The #1 (3mm) guard had a couple teeth break after a couple months. I'm still using it, but shopping for a replacement. This happened on my previous clipper as well. The #1 guard is the only one I use.So be careful of the teeth on the #1 and you'll be fine."
4,Good Purchase,"Having a cordless shaver has been great. I can get a few shaves out of one charge. I think the trick is to let it charge a few days before using it the first time, otherwise it won't get a full charge. Well worth it, and I'll probably never buy a corded shaver again. This is easily washable too."
5,Excellent hair buzzer,Works great and the best is it's cordless. I shaved my head with it and it's easy to clean. Comes with all the attachments and a nice bag to hold everything.
5,Excellent clipper,"This worked like a champ right out of the box. Smooth cut and still working 3 mos later. Only complaint was one plastic guard was broken, but the rest work fine."
4,good hair clipper,"It seems like cordless operation lasts only for a couple of haircuts.Length of haircut is not that easily adjustable. You have to change a plastic adapter, and in my case I miss some more short lenght haircut adapters (there's a big difference between the shortest and the following)Apart from those comments, it's good and reliable, and looks durable"
3,poor battery,"The trimmer is ok, the only thing that doesn't last for a reasonable time is the battery."
5,Great Shaver,"Lasts a long time between charges, easy to clean (under running water) and does an excellent job of trimming. It's much cleaner and very convenient to be able to cut hair in the shower."
4,Pretty Nice Trimmer,"I plugged the trimmer in and charged it for about 30 hours, had my wife give me a haircut, and it ran out of juice in less than 15 minutes.It does run while plugged in though, so it wasn't a very big deal. If you can cut your hair in less than 15 minutes, than this will probably work for you.The trimmer is sharp, very accurate, quiet, and the guides go on and off very easy. If the charge lasted more like 30 minutes this would be world class."
1,Horrible Company,"SO I THOUGHT I WAS GETTING THE PRODUCT IN THE PICTURE, THE REMINGTON CLIPPER BUT TURNS OUT SHAVER OUTLET SENT ME SOME KNOCK OFF, NO-NAME PRODUCT THAT LOOKS SIMILAR BUT ISN'T IT. WHY THEY WOULD STEAL MY MONEY BAFFLES ME BUT I AM TAKING LEGAL ACTION. SO BEWARE OF THIS COMPANY SHAVER OUTLET, THEY ARE CROOKS."
2,its ok,"Its alright. It does what it should, but it doesn't run very fast, and the battery life on it is awful. I just leave it plugged in all the time so the battery doesn't discharge before I need to use it again."
1,Bait and Switch.,"I ordered the Remington HC-600. What I received was the RMPRO CUT-UP HC600P. None of this was included ""storage bag, 3 sectioning clips, scissors, neck brush"" and there was a small bottle of clipper oil which Remington doesn't provide with their Titanium models because they don't require it. This was a complete rip off using a clever knock off. Shaver Outlet is going to the banned for life list."
5,A Must Have !,"I came across this book at a friends house and found myself sifting throught it. It has ALOT of useful information on so different many topics. It has useful tips on everything from how to clear a drain with cheaper products to how to save money on gas...I had to order a copy of my own ASAP, you should to!"
5,Good safe climbing techniques,As a climbing guide I found the book accurate with easy to follow text and great photos. Novices as well as seasoned climbers will learn a ton of usefull and important techniques.
5,Very good,Very well written and organized however some confusion once in a while withthe illustrations being mis or non labeled.The magic x should have been defined earlier in the text.Limited look at building anchors.Minor items - loved reading it.
3,Flawed Memorabilia,"This is a reproduction of an original poster for the Our Gang short ""Fly My Kite."" However, the poster was made after the first release of the film because it features photos of gang members that did not join the series until after the Fly My Kite release. Those pictured are Spanky, Stymie, Pete the Pup, Wheezer, Dickie, Mary Ann, Farina, and Chubby. However, the cast list on the side lists members of the silent era who are not pictured or featured in the film. However, this piece of memorabilia would be a welcome addition to Our Gang fanatics who don't mind these minor errors."
3,Ready To Rumble Soundtrack,Love this!!!Especially the Dweezil Zappa version!Lost one copy. One copy was borrowed and never returned. Keeping this bad boy for only ME!!
4,Where is the King Theme?,"This cd isn't too bad. It has some pretty good redone songs, which were apart of makin the movie good. Sting theme is pretty good. Where is the King theme though? C'mon"
3,Good Mix of Music,"If you are looking for a good mix of music, check this CD out. It has everything from The Offspring to the Zappa brothers. Bif Naked does a great rendition of ""We're Not Gonna Take It"", but the remix of ""Bawitdaba"" leaves a lot to be desired. ""Bloodstains"" by The Offspring, ""Last Resort"" by Papa Roach, and ""Girls, Girls, Girls"" by Motley Crue more than make up for Amhet & Dweezil Zappa's rendition of ""Baby One More Time"" and ""We Will Rock You"" by DJ Hurricane & Scott Weiland. ""Baby On More Time"" was bad to begin with, and ""We Will Rock You"" should have Queen up in arms. All in all, this is a good CD for a mix of old and new music. 3 stars!"
5,It Is The Best.!!!,"I Like All The Songs. I Like Bawitdaba, Jump Around, We Will Rock You, Last Resort, And Baby One More Time The Best.!!! I Like Them The Best Because They Are The Best Songs.!!! I Don't Like King Of Rock. I Don't Like That Because I Is Not Good.!!!"
5,Just Buy The Weekend Navigtor,"When this book was published I gave it a quick look in our library and bought it. I use it in an Electronic Navigation class I teach at a local ASA Sailing School. It is the best in its field, very understandable, gorgeous illustrations and it is one of the best manuals for Maptech Chart Navigator which they provide free on the accompanying CD.There is nothing close to this book."
4,A-Z all you need to know about London streets,"buy this one if you want to get your bearings ahead of time, otherwise, you can buy a mini-version of this book in most stores around London (e.g. Tesco, Marks & Spencers, tourist shops).You can explore anywhere in London with confidence. A-Z lists streets, attractions, tube locations, etc... every Londoner has one."
5,We needed a permanent fix,We could not find any dots that had permanent adhesive and was not extremely expensive. These dots are used after a quality control person has checked the product and it is ready for packaging. They work great and stay put! We will continue to purchase these adhesive dots from Amazon.
4,hard to find item,These boxes of single color adhesive dots are hard to find. Most office supply stores only carry ones with multiple colors. I'm glad I could find them here and fairly affordable too.
5,Program Assistant,"We've used this product for many years in our Adirondack program. We're always pleased with the quality of product. Delivery is always fast and using the website is quick and easy.Thanks,Kitty"
2,"Title says GREEN, picture shows RED","The labels are fine, they will serve the purpose i need. My complaint is with the image vs. description: yes, the title of the item is GREEN (Avery label 5791), but the labels in the image are RED (Avery label 5790). As such, i ended up ordering the wrong color. I've seen this complaint in dozens of reviews on Amazon lately; images don't match the shipped product. I know i should have paid better attention, but it makes for a poor experience when the image is misleading."
5,Great Frankie Beverly CD,"Excellent Cd, has all his best songs and arrived in good condition. I would recommend to anyone."
5,Fantastic!,"This CD is awesome. I really like it. I am a huge fan of Frankie Beverly and Maze, the songs are classics. I would recommend it highly"
3,Maze Greatest Hits,"This CD is a comprehensive collection of Maze's greatest hits. If you are a fan of the group, you will love this CD."
5,Excellent,I had been looking for thisCD for some time and was glad to finally get it I am enjoying it very much.
2,If you want to write a musical. . . .,"But most of us don't. I bought this book expecting a history of the musical, and there are some interesting chapters on historical antecedents of the modern musical. But when it hits the 20th century, it bogs down in technical details of interest only to aspiring professionals: how to write good lyrics, how to structure the plot, even what's wrong with the NY theater district. Deadly dull stuff. No discussion of great performers, no analyses of individual musicals, nothing."
3,Hit-and-miss overview of American musical theater,"Richard Kislan shows care and concern in his research on the subject, and the facts he reports seem accurate. He is at his best on his chapters about the elements of musical theater, including the book, lyrics, the score, dance and design. Here he provides some nice insights, and the objective character of these topics compliments his writing skills. Unfortunately, his more subjective chapters on the history of the American musical reveal a turgid, laborious writing style that mitigates the effectiveness of his good research and organization of information. The paucity of information about musicals after 1980 (despite the 1995 revision) is an additional liability. The reasonable price of the book makes it still a good value despite the shortcomings."
5,Oxygen Healing Therapies,"I first read this book years ago and found it very insightful, but never did anything except take peroxide baths. I've suffered from a severe case of nasal congestion and lung problems for almost 14 years and nothing the medical profession has done has improved it. They have kept me breathing, but I never improved. Then I rediscovered H2O2 treatments after chelation did very little for me. I have had 5-6 treatments and immediately felt an improvement in my health. First my lungs cleared up within 3 days and then my sinuses cleared in about 10 days after my second treatment. I have much more breathing capacity now then ever before. I am continuing the treatments because I still feel there is something deep within me that needs them. Everyone who has seen my face says I have far more color than I've had in years. This book is excellent at laying everything out clearly and concisely. I highly recommend it and the treatments."
2,Quite Interesting,"An interseting book, but I much prefer the work of Ed McCabe, the real master of Oxygen Therapies. His latest book Flood Your Body with Oxygen which I could not put down, gets to grip with the subject in a fascinating way and style that Altman does not have. Overall it is a fair book."
5,Something Just Clicks,"This album means Christmas.From the beautiful opening rendition of ""T'was..."" to the rousing closer, this is a collection to remember.Much has been made of the quality of Como's voice. He was never better than here. But what truly separates this from all other Christmas albums are the arrangements. From the soft chorals of ""Silent Night"" to the inspired counterpoint of ""The 12 Day...,"" the musicians blend with Como's warmth and create a texture rare in pop.As an added bonus, even the 'original' tunes are inspired. ""That Christmas Feeling"" is certainly not out of place among the more traditional favorites.All of this adds to up delightful holiday listening year after year."
5,One of the best!,"I grew up listening to Perry Como every Christmas. My parents had the vinyl album. If you like Christmas music, this is a definite plus to have! Perry Como's soothing voice makes these songs so much better."
4,Days of Christmas Past,"I grew up listening to this album and Perry Como's melodic voice singing these songs is part of my Christmas tradition every year - I listen while baking cookies or writing Christmas cards. There is nothing fancy here, just Perry's clear tenor singing old favorites with nice arrangements."
5,Echoes of fond Christmas memories for every generation,"This was one of the great Christmas albums my parents played every year while I was growing up. And it's probably one of the ones they heard growing up as well. Even as a child, I remember Perry Como's voice coming across like a friendly neighbor -- not as a voice faraway in another time, but like a good friend you may know. All of the songs are sweet, melodic, and almost hypnotic in a very Christmasy kind of way.Perry Como begins with his classic rendition of ""'Twas the Night Before Christmas"" and does so as naturally as if he had written it himself. Most people find ""The Twelve Days of Christmas"" to a be quite frankly a very annoying song, but Como makes it sound as easy to enjoy as anyone's favorite Christmas carol. His version of ""Frosty the Snowman"" is my personal favorite of that song. It ranks right up there with Jimmy Durante's immortal rendition.I also recommend Perry Como's ""red"" Christmas album."
4,LOVEEE,"I absolutely love this belly button ring. I have gotten a ton of compliments!!! The only problem is the ball at the top got rusty like the gold comes off, so be careful with sensitive skin. Thank you so much and THE PACKAGING WAS PERFICTLY SAFE <3 thank you. great price as well!!!"
3,"Excellent service, decent product.",I am extremely satisfied with the service but the product was of fair quality. I purchased this for my fiance's sister who is 18 and she absolutely loved it and so did her mother. Thank you.
3,Belly ring,"Received it on time, it looked beautiful, two days later I lost the small screw on piece! Very disappointed because I really liked it."
3,It's okay,I liked the look of it a lot but when I wore it the part that goes in bottom infected my belly-button. I took it out after two weeks. I wouldn't really recommend it.
2,uninspiring characters,Combine a completely unbelievable male character with a fairly unlikable female character and you get a novel which is a struggle to force yourself to read.
4,A needed update well done,"Other opinions notwithstanding, Charlie Wing has done a much needed update on a classic, innovative reconsideration of housebuilding. Wing had the benefit of 20 years of hindsight on what worked and what did not work among Rex Roberts many sugggestions for fundamentally changing the basic American house. Wing, educated in physics and experienced in the building trades, helped found an owner-builder school prompted by Mr. Roberts' original book. His buildings and Mr. Roberts are the basis for his update. The tin-foil insulation is not mentioned because it was a disaster -- it did not insulate but it did cause condensate and rotting, even on Mr. Roberts own house. Enough said. If you insist on reading the original, take no action based on it until you determine whether it's included in Mr. Wing's update. Otherwise, enjoyable and thoughtful reading all round. I've built a house based on these principles and thoroughly enjoyed it."
4,"Nice toy, could've been bigger though...","The latest (along with the arcade) of the World of Springfield Simpsons environments, the First Church of Springfield does well on appearances. Reverand Lovejoy looks great, comes with a conductor's hat & a toy train in addition to the standard Good Book that we have seen before, and says some good phrases (""I'm a Shepard without a flock."") The biggest problem is that the two character slots by the pew are so close together, it's tough to get two characters on them. I found it impossible to fit Bleeding Gums Murphy & his suspected long-lost brother Dr. Hibbert on at the same time. As they have it set up, I suppose the only way they could have made more room for the figures would have been to make the playset itself bigger...which Playmates is likely not wanting to do. But, it is a Simpsons toy, with a great figure, which makes it a must-have."
1,Fabric is way to cheap.,"Nice flag, but the material it is made of is very weak. Definitely not for outdoor use. However, I am even wary of hanging it in the wall. I feel as if even some sunlight will tear the material. It is so thin, you can almost see through. Its really an insult to use this material in such a nice flag."
4,Whew,"This was the kind of vacation I always wanted to take. Cressida meets Draco on a Greek island & woo-hoo! Seriously, I liked this book. It was a typical Harlequin & pretty well written. In fact, I have read other Sara Craven Harlequins and I think this one is her best. I didn't find Cressy weak, as some other reviewers did; just confused."
3,MEB,"The basic plot of the book is that the heroine vacations on a Greek island and falls in love with the local billionaire. They hit it off and decided to get married. However, the heroine gets a call that her dad is dying and has to return home. She does not pass this information on and as a result he follows her home, gets her father out-of-debt, and basically forces her into being his mistress. While the book is good, you do wish the heroine would speak up!"
1,Huge disappointment for this longtime fan,"Apparently I'm the only one who feels this way, but this album is a bore. I appreciate the concept, I guess, but this thing is going right into the box. The title track has a little bit going on, but it's downhill fast after that.Hiatt has made some amazing music over most of my lifetime, but this isn't it...the rhythms are pedestrian, and frankly, I was so stupefied by the music that I can't focus on the lyrics. When I want to hear this genius, I'll put on anything from the mid-90's through Tiki Bar and be a lot more satisfied. Sorry, but if you like Perfectly Good Guitar or even Cry Love, you're going to find this one tedious."
3,Not too bad but not his best effort,"Coming off the last two releases (Crossing Muddy Waters and Beneath this Gruff Exterior) I was looking forward to something better. Unlike many of the other reviewers, I'm not blown away by the band.The album opens up ok with the title track, but then moves into a couple of songs that are pretty lackluster. I can't remember a Hiatt album that has so many boring songs pieced together in a row. Neither ""Howling down the Cumberland,"" ""My Thunderbird"" nor ""Wintertime Blues"" live up to the high standards I've come to expect from Mr. Hiatt.It's at ""Love's Not Where We Thought We Left It"" when he finally finds his groove. This is the first time he really seems to let loose on the album, singing with emotion to the beat of the tom tom drum. The rest of the songs on the album are definitely up to his standards, although there is nothing special."
3,Master of Disaster,Master of Disaster being Hiatt's 18th record and 2005 release is a sound that I have heard so many times and whilst it is not bad it is not that great either. Hiatt's vocals sound scruffy and like he smoked between the recordings of songs. Allmusic gave the album 3.5 stars but I think this is a little to generous so I give it 3/5. The booklet has all the lyrics included but they are not easy to read because of the clunky font. 3/5.
3,A Mixed Bag,"It's a pleasant enough record with several songs that are really excellent (Love's Not Where We Thought We Left It, Ain't Ever Goin Back and Find You at Last). The rest reming me of Crossing Muddy Waters."
5,Very Solid Effort,"I'm a huge John Hiatt fan even though I must admit that I generally find his albums uneven, or something like that. Master of Disaster is great and it's Hiatt at his best. My other favorite John Hiatt albums are ""Slow Turning"" and ""Crossing Muddy Waters"", and the DVD ""Live From Austin TX"" is superb."
5,Awesome,"John Hiatt is an incredible musician, songwriter, singer and artist, and this album is spectacular. Full of wisdom, wicked humor, great guitar licks and lots of heart."
2,Listened to it twice,"and put it in the cabinet. If I get 3 more, I'll make them a coaster set.I have been a John Hiatt fan for years, and this just doesn't measure up to his usual high standards. I found it to be a pretty boring listen."
2,Only the title track...,"The title track, Master of Disaster is a blaster! Great hard-hitting Hiatt tune. It is as good as, if not one of, his best! But the rest of the tracks just don't come up to this same level of quality. A one song hit album..."
4,John Hiatt does what he does best!!!,"I have had other favorite artists over the years, but this cd hits home. I could go through each track and give you the pros and cons of each. I don't want to do that...because for the most part it is meaningless for someone who hasn't heard the cd. Let's cut through the B.S. All i suggest is that you give this one a listen. Make up your own mind. Play it a couple of times, let it sink in, and i am sure that you will agree that John Hiatt is making some great music at this time in his career. No frills, buzzers, bells, or smoke and mirrors. Heartland ballads and white blues at its best."
3,Another poor recording by producer Jim Dickinson,"The sound quality of this recording is awful in stereo in either sacd or cd mode. The sound improves substantially when listened to in sacd multi-channel mode, but still not as good as his past recordings. Producer Jim Dickinson did the same botched job on Steve Forbert's ""Evergreen Boy"". It seems Mr. Dickinson prefers acoustic guitars that are buried in the mix with barely a hint of the sparkle that the instrument normally possesses. The same goes for the drums which sound like they're being played in another room most of the time. Although, this is not among Hiatt's best song writing efforts it is still very good, and worth having. If you have tone controls on your system I suppose you can improve the sound (I don't have them). If you have an sacd player and can listen in multi-channel, then you can get a substantial improvement."
1,Received an empty CD case.,"Very disappointed opening this CD package when I saw the package was empty, no CD.Will be returning the CD case for another. Hope this one is not empty."
1,master of disaster,"I had great expectations of this CD after reading the reviews; the John Hiatt CD ""Greatest Hits: The A & M Years"" is a must-own for any music lover. This M of D offering really is a huge, great, awful disappointment. His voice is so gravelly he cannot hold a tune much less sound melodious. Quite a change from his wonderful lyrics and great music on the afore-mentioned CD."
1,"Good CD, bad techology","This slipped thorugh my radar screen until I tried to rip my legitimately purchased CD onto my computer through I-Tunes. This CD is a hybrid disc, meaning CD/SACD format.The fact that it is released in a CD/SACD ( dual format) prevents it from being ripped to a computer. THIS IS A RIPOFF of my rights to legitimately do what I want with the recording.SPEAK UP, otherwise all CD's will be done this way. I don't understand...this makes me want to ONLY buy through ITUNES in the future. I can burn my own platable CD from that should I want to"
4,Another Fine Set of Songs,"Hiatt has been without doubt the most prolific songwriter in pop music, with few rivals. His songs, covered from NGDB to Mandy Moore are generally simple but tell great stories.I once wrote years ago that Hiatt had the irreverence of a beat poet. And while I'm still trying to figure out what I meant, I think it had to do with his style of putting words together that didn't always seem to make sense, but then just did. He does it again here with ""Master of Disaster.""With members of the North Mississippi All Stars backing him this time, there is a very different feel, but the gritty, nasally tone that Hiatt brings to his voice also brings the tunes to life.""Master of Disaster"" is a great kickoff, ""Thunderbird"" and ""Cumberland"" are all well-written, with a bit of rhyme and a sense that these are real people, or as close to real as Hiatt can get 'em. All in all, a great joy to listen to, as most of Hiatt's recordings have been."
3,Some of the articles are Ok.,"It's kind of a continuing education course for a mid level brand managers.I highlighted about 5% or this book so there is not much to sink your teeth into and have anything hit the ribs and stick.The good news is that it was worth the 2 hours it took to complete.John HalloranCertified Gold Exchange, Inc"
2,Aspern? Not Waterloo?,"I am a little bit surprised, I thought that British author can be interested only at Waterloo. I agree with the other customer, this book is for beginners.This is a beverage. The REAL MEAL is Arnold's work!"
3,Not very romantic,"I saw this movie last night, but I has not left much of an impression. It was a weird movie, with some hilarious scenes, but there was just no way I was going to like the main characters. Sophie - an erotic writer - chases after Eddie, a jewel thief with a fiancee. There is nothing romantic about it. They willingly deceive Eddies girlfriend, Sophie knows about his illegal business and lies for him to the police. All ending in a very embarrassing scene with police listening in on them in a sleezy motelroom. This is not what I call romance...."
5,Very Happy,I was pleasantly surprised with this movie. It was very good and the quality of the product and service were great.
4,The Real Little Ultimate Jazz Fake Book,Man this thing has a lot of songs. It includes Christmas songs and some folk songs. The only thing I don't like about it is the print is a little small. But that is one reason the price was so good.
3,"Small Version of ""The Ultimate Jazz Fakebook""","This book is a miniture version of Hal Leonard Corporation's ""The Ultimate Jazz Fakebook"". It's got all the same songs, it's just notebook sized.I'm returning my copy because a) I already have the larger version and b) even with my glasses on, it's just too small to read on a music stand"
2,Too many mistakes to be taken seriously,"I've never seen a fake book with so many inaccuracies. ""So What"", the Miles Davis standard, is presented in D dorian with the chords half a step too high for the melody. ""Song for My Father"" appears in 2/4 time, with the A section being one measure (two counts) short. ""Basin Street Blues"" appears without chord changes. There are plenty of bad chord choices in this book that don't come anywhere near fitting the melody. Furthermore, with ""over 625 songs"", omitted are such essential jazz standards as ""Stardust"", ""I Got Rhythm"", ""Blue Bossa""... instead you get tunes like ""Frosty the Snow Man"" and pop tunes by Carole Bayer Sager. I gave up referring to this book a long time ago. I don't doubt that there are other mistakes I haven't come across. About as useful as a dictionary with misspelled words."
3,Not complete enough,"When I first bought this book i was starting out in Jazz and figured I'd be able to use this book to learn alot of rep.Unfortunately many requested jazz standards are omitted in this version which was very frustrating for me. I had to eventually buy the The real book (now legally published by Hal Leonard Corp) to complete the many missing standards. If all you do is jazz, this is not the book for you. If you play some jazz but round up the gig with other songs this is a good book - It's got a few country classics, pop tunes, songs from musicals and xmas tunes."
4,Small and Mighty,"Being new to ""Fake"" books I wasn't sure what to expect. I was attracted to this because of its titles which are many. If you're into playing jazz and big band standards, this book is very comprehensive. I would say that most of the songs don't seem to be ""complete"" and are a shortened version but they do include at least the main verse of lyrics. I guess the idea is that if they give you the main body of the song you can ""fake"" it from there. For one book to cover so many titles, its pretty amazing the scope of the book actually. I would however suggest that having a copier with an enlargement feature as a good idea if you are going to use the songs to learn from because the format is pretty small to use as a normal course of things.I like that it has a lot of well-known titles, it is relatively small and easy to pack and that it has lyrics."
3,"Problem today with spirituality, failure to launch/believe!","Thus far I will say this is a Good Read; however, the problem goes beyond the pages to applying new insights!."
3,"Pretty, but...","First of all, the item is very pretty, and in the long run my wife was satisfied. I couldn't give it more stars though, because when we opened the box we found that all the wreaths were bent up, and all the harnesses but one had come off the reindeer. My wife and I were, of course, disappointed, and we called the customer service line and were told, ""Try Super-Glue Gel.""Well, we were able to eventually fix it, but for the money we paid I think the QC leaving the factory should be a little bit higher."
3,This is simply porn prose in that the style was tired uninteresting,"I think that someone should say right up front, that this is a sex first book with plot, characters, and storytelling supporting the many, and very explicit sexual encounters as the main feature. I was not over excited by the ""tiny', nasty mouthed, hard hitting detective who could presumably, best a full room of hulking body guards. Oh, yes, that's right she was a witch, with powers even she didn't know she had, but then that was really very secondary to the creative sex and gutter language."
4,Insightful Guide to Interpersonal Relationships,"Wayne Perry's book, ""Basic Counseling Techniques,"" offers great insight on the topic of interpersonal relationships. While the book is subtitled, ""A Beginning Therapist's Toolkit,"" this is a publication and guide that will benefit an audience far broader than just beginning therapists.Perry covers an enormous topic -- counseling -- in a straightforward, user-friendly, and engaging manner. The book distills major working concepts such as how to ask effective questions down to workable and understandable terms. In essence, Perry has provided a ""Counseling Demystified"" guide for the benefit of all readers.You do not need to be a counselor to appreciate this book (I am not a counselor). I believe that the systems thinking templates, practical skills guides, and hints are very useful for anyone working with and interacting with other people.This is an accessible and useful guide -- I recommend it."
5,apparently very hot book....,"I loved this book, very helpful...especially for the begginer therapist. He tells you exactly what you need to say and do. I have about 100 books in my bookshelf at work... this is the only one that was stolen....intern I suspect."
5,Dr. Perry is an amazing Professor,"I am fortunate to study Ethics and do my Clinical Practicum under the direction of Dr. Perry. I have found his instruction and advice to be timeless and invaluable. I am thrilled that this work has garnered such positive reviews. He has a tremendous amount of wisdom stemming from his Air Force career, his position in the ministry, and his secular counseling experience to offer a perspective that is vast and broad ranging. I hope that many others can enjoy this work and those to come."
5,Lots of Fun and so Cute!!,"My 9 month old received this for Christmas and loves it! He is not quite crawling yet, he sort of scoots around and loves to grab and wrestle this toy. So far it has been very sturdy but yet soft enough for the baby to roll on and squeeze. The voice and phrases it says are so very cute too, we love the little giggle and when it says ""Hello Baby""!! This is an adorable toy!"
2,Cute,This toy is cute but it only crawls for second. If you blink the toys has already stopped. I was very disappointed that the toy only crawled for a second. However the toy is very cute.
4,perfect for little ones trying to crawl,"I loved this toy. I got it for my daughter when she was 7 months old and within a week and half of playing with it, she was crawling right after it. The music it plays is cute as well. My husband says when it turns its head and talks to the baby he finds it creepy, but I just figure he's being a typical guy cause I don't see it. I would recommend this over other learning to crawl toys. I got her different ones including the touch and crawl Minnie Mouse and this one worked the best."
3,"is good, not excellent","is an option for play with your children, i woud like the toy could turn sound on/off, or diferentes songs and word that the customer could choose"
2,Toy Sounds Like A Car Wreck!,"I recently purchased the Magic Touch N' Crawl Pooh as a Christmas gift for my best friend's 7 month old little boy. I was so excited to read the rave reviews (with only one mentioning a mechanical sound). To my dismay and disappointment when Pooh arrived and was started, he sounded like a car wreck was occuring every time he turned his head! I was extremely disappointed and promptly returned him. (I must note that Amazon.com does make returning a purchase extremely easy.) Please be aware of this terrible sound that is much louder than the music that plays when considering purchasing this product!"
3,Scares my Daughter,My daughter received thsi toy as a gift when she was 1 month old. She is now 7 1/2 months old. She loves it unless we turn it on. It has a fairly loud mechanical noise when the head turns and then it speaks and plays music and crawls which makes her cry every time.. My daughter is timid so if you have a timid little one this is not the toy for them.. But if you little one is more like my first child... outgoing and boisterous then i am sure this would be a great toy.
3,A little too loud,"I bought this product based on all the positive reviews. However, I feel that the ""Pooh"" voice and music is too loud. It makes me a little nervous to have some of the ""electronic/musical"" toys so close to my baby's ears. I wish it had a volume control. Aside from the loudness though, it is a cute toy and looks like it is fun to play with."
1,"boo hiss to lucy, queen of comedy","think you are going to relax, share a few laughs with your past and see some lucy movies? think again! this is a butchered retake on SOME I Love Lucy t.v. reruns, slashed and cut snipets with voice overs from commentators we don't care about nor purchased this dvd to hear from. sort of funny, but the ford co. comercials were often the best part. Know why? they weren't interrupted. i like ford, i presently own a ranger, explorer and town car. i note some of the used dvd's are selling for 2 cents, i'd say if they paid for shipping, that's what this dvd is worth. i got screwed in buying this. don't follow me. if you pay for postage, you can have mine for free."
5,Excellent movie,Could not find this movie. I know where to go wjen stores are outdated for available movies. Also delivery time was within time posted.
1,How in the Hell did that happen !!!,I bought this movie. It would have been a great movie if I could have enjoyed it. It was suppose to be brand new but I guess I received a defected one. How in the hell did that happen. And when I got online to try to exchange it I couldn't. I'm very unhappy.
4,A Really Good Movie,"This was a great movie. All of the actors played their roles so well that it's almost as if you aren't watching a movie. It's like you're witnessing these peoples lives as it unfolds. It didn't go into the real-real-grittyness of the streets but you get a real clear idea of it. Latifah was great, and I was also impressed with Evan Ross's roll.This was an all around great film and I don't regret buying it."
3,"Another work by ""Lawrence of Arabia""","This autobiographical book is written by T. E. Lawrence of ""Lawrence of Arabia"" fame. Dissapointed with the results of the World War One, he returned to England and enrolled annonymously in the RAF(Royal Air Force). He recounts the harrassing experience of boot camp and military life, with a few gems of human insight and reflection. As a cohesive narrative it fails, as literature to compare to his ""Seven Pillars"" if fails, but as an accurate and honest record of his life as lived in the pre-World War Two RAF it is highly illuminating. Miltary history and Lawrence fans will give this book an extra star, an important supplement of material on one the century's most fascinating people."
5,Fabulous !,"I don't know what that queen is complaining about, this book is the bomb. Huge colorful hardcover with all manner of unknown info and photos (the bios/stories of the album cover photographers is worth the price alone.) I didn't realize how much money this was getting on the second hand market, wow! (I would never sell mine even for a million bucks) I can't wait for ""Funplex"" to come out, I saw the B's in Charlotesville a few months back and they just get better with age. GREAT job Mats, and sorry it took so long to post this review. I only hope it's eventually updated cause i would buy it all over again!"
4,Works great!,"Works great with theWatts 500313 2-Stage Undercounter Lead, Cyst & VOC Reducing Drinking Water System.Save your money and get the above system and use these filters as your replacement filters."
3,discontinued,"this set-up worked fine for years, now the carbon filter (the one with the spigot and o-rings) is replaced by one with no spigot. the company says it will work the same. i wonder will unfiltered water leak thru as the spigot and o-rings were replaced with nothing!"
4,Filtering just fine...,This product seems to be performing as it was described to do. I just wish they would add the media to remove Chlorine and Fluoride as well.
3,"beware ""2-pack"" designation","Filter is just fine, at the same price as other major retailers. Replace them when your water filter starts getting really slow...I'm a bit disappointed that the double ""2-pack"" designation didn't mean it was two 2-packs... not sure I should have expected that, but I did."
1,Shocked and dismayed,"I was excited to read a new history of Kentucky, but I was VERY disappointed with the efforts of Harrison/Klotter. While the two historians are well-known and well-respected, they did an unfortunate job in telling the history of Kentucky. They have done what any good historian will not do, judged the past by the present, in assuming that Kentucky, in the past, was comparable to Kentucky today. It saddens me to think that the children of Kentucky will grow up reading this book, and one that I fear robs them of their history and heritage. The book does nothing for Kentucky!"
4,The Wanderer,Spohie a thirteen-year-old girl goes on a sailing trip all summer. Her adoption-mother is worried sick about her while she is gone. She goes with her two adoptive cousins and her three adoptive uncles. They are sailing from America to Ireland to get to her grandpa Bompie's house. They make it to Bompie's house and Bompie tells them his stories from when he was a child.On a scale from 1-10 I would give this book a 7 because it is about her life. It is a very good book. It has good details and strong words. This book has intresting characters and good settings that a lot of books don't have. I would recommend this book for kids the ages 8-12 years of age.
4,Amazing Soundtrack,"I loved this soundtrack when I heard it accompanying the movie, I love it even more now. The score chosen for the this movie was brilliant and the songs reach me every time I hear them!"
5,One of the best movie soundtracks out there...,"After watching the movie, it was really inspiring and the music was just absolutely amazing. I bought the soundtrack and I play it all the time in my CD player. My favorites are ""Crash,"" ""No Such Thing as Monsters,"" ""Sirens,"" ""A Really Good Cloak,"" ""Sense of Touch,"" ""In the Deep,"" and ""Maybe Tomorrow."" If you haven't seen the film already, I highly recommend it 'cause it makes you think about the issues surrounding racism. Afterwards, get the soundtrack...the music is definitely moving."
2,The movie was a lot better!,"I was disappointed. At the time of my purchase, my opinion was in the minority, but... This CD just doesn't do it."
5,An objective study,"Professor Burgwyn's excellent study of the Italian invasion of Yugoslavia during World War II is likely to be the definitive work on the subject for some time to come. Chronicling Mussolini's invasion requires a great deal of patience and judiciousness, since the cast of characters is large and the main plot breaks down into numerous sub-plots. Moreover, giving an objective account of what happened is not easy, since many observers who write about this murky period have axes to grind. Burgwyn, however, does not base his work mainly on secondary sources. Digging in official archives, he has fashioned a concise and clear narrative out of refractory material. His book, as a leaading historian of the period has said, is an important contribution to the history of World War II."
5,Am I allowed???....,"To review my own book?I think its great. But don't take my word for it - comments from readers.""Super sonic speed on shipping! Outstanding writing, Love what i bought!""""Amazing person! Wrote a book in 3 days and an artist too!!! A+++++""""I'm still laughing over the Hairy Back Stories..."""
3,"Important, but flawed","The book is very important in that it gives a factual and detailed account of the ""creation"" of the refugee problem. He rejects the Palestinian claims that Israel carried out a ""master plan"" to expel all Arabs, and also the Israeli claims that the Palestinians exodus was some kind of accident, and that there were no cases of expulsion and violence. The flaw in the book is that he does not sufficiently capture the feeling of the Israelis at the time that the Palestinians would endanger the possibility of establishing their own state, and the fear of their fate if Israel lost the war, especially only 3 years after the conclusion of the Holocaust."
1,Changing History for the sake of changing it,"As Qouted in the book:David Ben Gurion: ""[We] must expel Arabs and take their places"" Appearing in this book, p. 25.Original:We do not wish, we do not need to expel the Arabs and take their place. All our aspirations are built upon the assumption -- proven throughout all our activity in the Land -- that there is enough room in the country for ourselves and the Arabs.We do not wish, we do not need to expel the Arabs and take their place. All our aspirations are built upon the assumption -- proven throughout all our activity in the Land -- that there is enough room in the country for ourselves and the Arabs.Beware of political agenda interfering with the Science of History and post-modern trends of ""breaking myths"" for the sake of it!"
5,A must for those interested in the establishment of Israel,"An excellent book that documents the origin of the Palestinian refugee problem using Israeli sources. Well researched and written, it is hard to debate Moriss's conclusions."
5,Well researched and unbiased,Mr. Morris lays out the particulars of a very intricate and sensitive issue with adeptness rarely seen. This book doesn't puport to be the final word but a factual statement of the matter at hand.A must read for those wishing to learn more about the Palestinian and Israeli issues that are as relevant today as when this book was written.If not more so!
5,Read This and Act!,"Marla Felcher has done something important. She's written an investigative book that unmasks the scandalous state of our federal regulatory system, and shows us what to do about it. This is a story that should outrage every parent who has used baby equipment -- from bath seats to portable cribs -- with blind trust. For there is, in fact, no insurance that this equipment is safe. Every year children and killed and maimed using products that their parents naively thought was designed to protect them. It is not adequately tested (if at all) and when it is found defective, recall advertising is half-hearted at best. This won't change until the Consumer Products Regulatory Commission has more money, and more legal power. Buy this book, read it and take action!"
1,"Not a bargain, arrived broken","Disappointing- crackers were shipped in a box without any protective packing either on bottom or top, just on the sides. Cracker packages arrived slip open and thus crackers were both stale and broken. Amazon usually does a better job than this. Not a bargain when the crackers can't be used."
1,Who Shook the box?,"Someone must have shaken the boxes violently while packing or shipping. 1/2 or more of the crackers are broken, which works out great if you like crumbled crackers in your soup or chili. For those of us who don't, it is irritating to find only 1/2 the box usable."
3,It's ok,Bought this item a few years back for my toddler. I thought it would be bigger than it actually was. It is quite small and can not fit much into it. He loved it though and would put some smaller toys in it and cart them around. The backpack is very cute too.
5,Cute little bag!,"Cute, and functional for a small child. Just big enough for a couple of toys, and light enough to not strain little backs. Vibrant colors. Purchased 2 of these."
3,Small!,"I should have listened to the first reviewer who said it was too small for daycare. I adore the colors and will probably use it to hold his snacks for when we step out. I put it on his back (he's 15mths) and it's adorable on him!! I can't believe I spent more for the shipping than the product, what a no-no!!"
5,Precious!,I ordered this backpack for my 2 year old nephew! I filled it with small John Deere Tractors and had his name put on it! Turned out as a great Christmas gift.
2,Fell Apart,"It worked fine for about 6 months. Then it fell apart. All the screws holding the metal section to the back plastic section came out of the plastic, and one plastic piece is severely bent. I believe that it overheated. There is a smell and dark residue inside the plastic section. I was using a 500 watt Westcott bulb. I might be able to put it back together, but am concerned that it might not be safe."
1,Mine fell apart too!,Pretty much exactly what the last reviewer said. It overheated and the plastic body holding the metal screws melted. The light fell about 8 feet to the floor.Extremely poor design. Mine didn't last 3 months. DO NOT PURCHASE. WASTE OF MONEY.
2,A Lost Masterpiece that Should Have Stayed Lost,"My parents saw Burton in Hamlet on Broadway in '64, from which this original taping derives, and I was excited to see that this was available. But no amount of appreciation of Richard Bruton's incredible acting or Sir John Gielgud's perfect directing can salvage this DVD. I have a large collection of early cinema on DVD (and am used to blotchy film & lousy sound) but the quality of this is so poor as to make enjoyment impossible. Forget any nonsense you have heard about ""theater in the raw"" or ""Hamlet stripped to the bare bones"". This is unwatchable as the picture is so bad. The best you can do with this is turn the screen off & just listen to the dialogue. It will give you an inkling of the brilliance of Burton ""live"". For a great DVD version of Hamlet, look for the BBC Shakespeare Hamlet series with Sir Derek Jacobi as Hamlet. Expensive but worth the money."
2,"Stale, flat, and unprofitable","I thought this was a very poor Hamlet. Polonious was the best performance in it. Claudius was passable. Gertrude was dreadfully dull. The staging was utterly unimaginative. Up front, I do not like Burton in much of anything, except for Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolfe. I think he's an egotistical, self-serving actor, and this performance is a prime example of that. His performance all facade and showy vocals, with no heart whatsoever. He's only minimally aware of the other actors performing with him. I even perfer Mel Gibson's honest if failed attempt to this showboating. The best Hamlets I've seen are Kevin Kline's uneven but brilliant performance and the classic Olivier. Buy one of those."
3,Performace ***** Technical Presentation *,"I was very excited when this release was announced. It is a fine performance though curious with a Welsh Hamlet against a backdrop of American supporting actors. It is much more complete than either Olivier or Gibson. A fascinating historical document of a Broadway event.The video and sound, alas, are very disappointing. The interview hypes ""Electronovision"" as some new technology for presenting Broadway to the masses, but it looks and sounds more like an old kinescope. Don't know what Evision was supposed to do for it. There was a Columbia (CBS, Sony) stereo audio recording (nla) made at the time...had it been of this specific performance (which it wasn't) then they might have synced it to greatly improve the sound.Meanwhile we must be satisfied to have a flawed (B&W) shadow of a marvelous night at the theater."
1,not happy,1.I ordered a new DVD as a gift for a friend who was extremely disappointed when it was unplayable. It was scratched and had a plastic tag attached to the play surface of the disc.2. I was unable to get a replacement and had to take a PARTIAL re-embursement instead!
4,"Brilliant production, bad production values","The acting and the purity of the performances (not just Burton, but all-around) are sublime and 5-star. But the buyer should be aware that this is live performance caught on film, and done on a shoestring. Thank goodness we have this record of what was a seminal production at all, so look past the technical quality and listen to the language. I am not sure why the price is so high, one might want to get a used copy! But a must for any student of theatre and/ or lover of Shakespeare."
5,Burton's Hamlet has aged surprisingly well,"If you're interested in Shakespeare on stage as opposed to Shakespeare on film, this is an excellent video. I taught an introductory theater course where we looked at several different Hamlets on video, and, in terms of getting a sense of the play's theatricality, this DVD and a recording I made of Peter Brook's recent production (recorded from German TV, I don't know if the video is commercially available or not) were the most enlightening for the students. I find Burton's performance considerably less affected than that of several modern interpreters, e.g. Branagh or Kevin Kline."
5,I enjoyed this adaptation,"I was a freshman in high school in 1964. The English Department purchased a bunch of tickets and we all went to see this. As it happened, the freshman class was studying Hamlet at the time.I have not seen the video, but I thoroughly enjoyed the original performance. It was just as the video reviews say - dark lighting, few closeups, etc. As I recall, there were only a couple of cameras positioned in or near the first row, so it we saw it as if we were in the audience. Quite different than anything else I have ever experienced. I also seem to recall that what we saw was live and without an audience. Richard Burton was a great Hamlet."
4,Gods living word,this bible is a study bibleI like it because its easy to understand God wordI have told friends about this bible
5,Awesome Study BIble,"This is the best study Bible I have ever had. It has the best layout, and bible study notes of any study Bible I have owned in 30 years.Want something you can understand? Check out this Bible.Bill & Victoria"
3,Faith in Action Study bible,"It depends on what you are looking for. I was wanting a Bible that had good maps of the Biblical region and explanations of how life was lived at that time, explanation of why some of their customs came to be, etc. While some people may be more interested in the info it has on today's world, that is not what I was wanting."
2,Not to happy,I'm not to happy with this broad head. It doesn't slice the deer open like it should they don't bleed out a lot hard to track
4,Braisheads for my crossbow,"These things literally 'drilled' a hole through the buck. I couldn't believe it. It looked like someone took a small hole saw to it!Blood trail? You better believe it. Of course, the animal expired after about 20 yards so no big tracking effort here.The broadhead is toast now. They are flimsy and not meant to be shot maybe more than once is what I'm finding out. Oh well, the venison in the freezer outweighs that problem though doesn't it."

5,Chomsky on politics and economics,I can call him an iconoclast but a brave voice in this world which is inexorably allowing itself to be swallowed up by 'freedom'. The most important thing about this book is that it makes a reader think about the 'norms' of our society which are taken for granted as truths or standard of practice. I am sure its going to disturb people like Mr.Kamm whose reaction to this book is evident by his searing remarks. It tells me that this book has shook him in a way he is not allowing himself to feel because it means he has to come out of his cocoon thinking.
4,reader's digest of Chomsky,"Short published articles by Noam, usually as South American pamphlets or leftist newspaper articles. Easy to read and to the point, quicker to get though than the comprehensive Understanding Power. A good short Chomsky to introduce his most important concepts. A good first Chomsky too see if you want more."
5,Superbly put. As usual Chomsky is at his best.,"A very provocative and mind stimulating work. At a time when this so-called ""information age"" of Corporate America is changing most of us to be desensitized, and the very gadgets that technology has made possible like the internate and cellular phone that is making human interaction obsolete, such books are a must read and long over-due for those of us who are concerned about the humanitarian aspect of this profit-oriented society."
4,Imperfect but effective,"Has some devestating, well-argued and well-documented arguments against free market capitalism, and the level of violence, imperialism, poverty and exploitation that runs with this. Also good in articulating some of the grounds for confidence in challenging this, rather than merely casting doomsday scenarios. However, suffers from the classic structural problem of being a collection of shorter articles joined into one book, which causes a lot of redundnacy and a focus that's over-focused at points."
4,True and depressing,"As usual, Chomsky nails it, and makes you want to jump off a bridge. I skimmed this after reading his book Occupy, and it seems to have predicted Occupy's emergence. It's unfortunate that we've come to the point of having to stage mass pointless protests just to point out the class inequality problem, but that's where we're at. Hopefully something will change in the way of autonomy and mutual aid, something Occupy Sandy is making a good example of right now."
4,Serious Reading,"I looked at the other reviews and it seems that either people love it or hate it. The people who hate it complain about the economics. But for me this book is more about the political culture. I found interesting the tibits about the history of corporations, quotes from Madison, etc. I think that you have to accept the basic thesis that the current system is corrupt to get the most from this book. For me, it is not a book about the application of economic theory but more about economic and political history and the current political environment."
3,Buyer Beware,"I purchased this product for my son who needed water testing equipment for his science project. Unfortunately, several of the test strips did not work and I was glad that I had ordered more tests than he required. As well, interpretation of the results requires visual observation to match the color of the strips to a chart. We called the help line number shown in the package for assistance with these two issues and did not get a call back. With shipping and duty to Canada adding another $100 to the cost of the 20 water tests we ordered, I told him that he'd better design a different type of project next year."
2,"For a rich, full surround sound experience buy a BOSE","Unfortunately I can't recommend this Sony product. 3 speaker (2 satellites & 1 subwoofer) systems are designed to take up less space than the typical 5.1 home theater systems while still delivering a respectable surround sound experience. While the Sony DAV-X1 is compact in size, it does a surprisingly poor surround-sound imitation on all audio sources with the exception of DVD. Audio output from all other sources sounds flat and is sorely missing the rich, full texture that you expect from a quality audio system. Spend a few extra bucks and purchase a Bose 3.2.1 system, the Bose delivers much of the home theater performance of a conventional five-speaker system."
5,Excellent System,I am happy with this home theatre system. It plays all the latest media type files. Sound quality is excellent. Can't complain.
2,Lame!,"FM tuner is horrible. But by far the biggest problem is that there is essentially ZERO bass when using the inputs for other devices (ipod, airport express itunes streaming, etc.) And the bass is NOT ADJUSTABLE when using any of these modes. So all other sources besides the built-in DVD sound tinny and ridiculous. Incredibly poor design."
2,Music = awesome; Movies = Mind-numbingly poor,"I have had this product as part of my home theatre setup for my family room [which opens into much larger room which is a dining room & kitchen]. To use this system to listen to music is very satisfactory but when we hunker-down to watch a movie, the sound quality, for speech specifically, is just horrible. My young kids are reading well-above grade level because every movie we watch can only be enjoyed with sub-titles on. If you blast the sound on a movie to try to capture the spoken word, then you will be blasted out of the room by the movie's music and sound effects. Conversely, if you turn the sound down to preserve your hearing, you cannot follow the dialogue. I acknowledge that my home's floor plan presents some acoustical challenges, but that does not account for the poor performance of a ""home theatre"" solution--especailly from Sony."
3,HDMI output broke twice,"The HDMI driver or whatever was repaired once when it was covered by warranty (1yr) but broke again within a couple of months. I get all red or red and white dots now. I wouldn't recommend this or any other sony player with HDMI output. Perhaps they use the same part everywhere. The audio is great and component video works, hence the 3 star."
4,Great Compact Surround Sound System,"This system has been superceded by a newer model but, at the current price, is a very good deal. It is a well built, high quality Sony product that delivers exactly what you would expect. Plenty of inputs and outputs make it versatile and ""obsolesence resistant"". The sound is great although, as you would expect, it doesn't equal a full six speaker system. I have it setup in our bedroom along with a 37"" LCD HDTV and I am thrilled with the result while my wife is thrilled with the system's compact dimensions."
4,very nice system,"I retired my junky RCA 5.1 system for this excellent 2 channel system. The sound is incredible, but you may have to adjust the bass-it's loud. The feature on the remote for the subwoofer is easy to use, but I find I need to adjust it for each movie I watch. So far, my only complaint. It is easy to set up and the simple design looks good on my gigantic Sony Wega T.V. I don't have my T.V. running through this system because my Wega has built-in Tru-Surround speakers, but something tells me that the optimum sound will be for a DVD. The sound for a CD is a little weak, and will probably be the same for the T.V. I'm a big movie watcher, so I love this system, and since I got it on sale for $400.00, the few faults are easily excused."
4,"Good, could be better","Happy with the system. Gave it 4 instead of 5 stars because the sub woofer, as others noted, is just too much ... but it is adjustable. I would rather they had put the power into the other speakers because I think they could stand to be louder (sometimes). There is no treble adjustment and no earphone socket but the good sound coming out compensates for these grievances. Believe I made out better then getting the similar, more expensive Bose system that I looked at many times in the store."
1,good product/inadequate accesories,"Good product, but Sony does not sell extensions for the proprietary cords that connect the satellite speakers to the main unit. So, if your installation requires an additional foot of speaker cord, the DAV-X1 is unusable. For lack of a ten cent piece of wire, Sony lost a $650 sale. Not smart."
2,A nightmare,"Save yourself the headcahe, find another system. All movies I have tried to view on this sysyem have shut down midway. Thinking that all my movies (which continues to play on my other DVD players)are either dirty or scratched, I have bought new movies with the same annoying result. Too late for me to return this thing that I bought in 1/07."
4,Great for DVDs!,"I read the reviews and saw that its good for DVDs and less good for tv (and music). I also read its less expensive than the BOSE 123, but more reliable and better quality. So far I have had the same experience. BUT I don't really want my TV viewing to be overpowered all the time with a big woofer sound - so its good for me. The surround sound may not be as good as the five speaker things - but much fewer wires, speakers and fuss. My only issue is I cannot figure how to plug my HD cable box three wires into the sound system. SO, I have the video going directly to the tv and the sound only going through the SOny. It involves a few more buttons to press - but seems OK. So far, so good."
2,"In the end, not worth the money","I bought this on sale for $750. I ended up returning it a couple days after receipt. The pros are: better picture quality while watching DVD's (via HDMI) and booming sound at times during DVD playback (explosions etc). But in the end I couldn't justify the cost because: faux surround sound wasn't impressive at all; not excited about having yet another box in the entertainment cabinet, another remote, and more wires.So I would recommend trying this if you get it from a vendor with a liberal return policy allowing you to give it a good try. Also, the $999 suggested retail is a bit crazy given the retailers who are selling it for much less."
3,Just don't get the Hype of other reviews,Why is Joe's WEB site so messy and crazy and poorly done yet write such great books. His other book spiritual sucess was outstanding and this book needs some help. Although it has great ideas he needs to give more examples and clear directions for using the secrets. I get what he is saying but feel he can add more. Since I am not 100% clear on how to be 100% perfect with some of the secrets more indepth coverage would be better. I should not have any question in my mind how to implement these secrets and this book leaves questions.I does have value though-Buy it used if you can.
4,Very good foundation for advertising. Practical concepts you can implement right away,A powerful book. Inspiring. Very good read. Easy to understand.Practical concepts you can implement right away. Good foundation from an advertising standpoint. Very good insight on J.C. Penny. This book will provide a foundation for focus. Good illustrations. I highly recommend.
5,Judo Box set....,I bought this Box Set from a Movie Stop for 3.99 and for that price it is a great deal. However it is not worth the 70 dollars + that it sells for here on Amazon. You would be better off paying for the internet and watching demonstrations on YouTube. You could probably find cheaper instructionals that are less expensive.
3,It works,It comes with the filters you need to replace 4-Stage filters for a year. It only comes with a 6 inch polisher which works fine. My Watts zero waste RO system originally came with a 10 inch polisher though. Next time I will be buying the filters separately at a local Ace Hardware store for the same price altogether but with 5 micron filters and a 10 inch Watts polisher.
5,Hägar is horrrrible,This is more than cool. The little lady I bought it for was definitely amazed (me too by the way).
4,Wanna get to know me better?,"This book is one of many excellent tools to use when trying to get to know someone, whether it be a new friend or your grandma! I mean, my mother and I have worked on a couple of pages from this book, and I've found out some interesting facts that I would have never known about her, had it not been for this book. I've also used this book on a date and it can be a lot of fun. It can be a total icebreaker when you have nothing to say, or it can be something to pull out when you and your date or friends are hanging out. It's a great book."
1,For those who can't think for themselves,"Unfortunate that people actually pay money for books like these. A book of questions for those who can't think of questions themselves. For those considering buying this book for $20, please sit back and try to come up with the questions yourself before wasting your hard earned money (and making this type of ""author"" richer)."
3,Super cute but doesn't work as expected.,"We were really stoked to get this adorable Trex, unfortunately it was a huge let down because after a couple of weeks the air was leaking out of his arms so the head did not fill and release. So we would cut the airflow then he would start working again. But after only a couple of hours he would drop and not refill. They need to seal the arms and have them move from an outside part, the holes that the arms are plugged into are what is leaking the air. It was also sort of a pain to have to buy an air pump for this guy, it does not come with one."
2,Not what I thought it would be,"I bought their 1st cd I thought ""Soul Survive"" was a great tune from this San Diego Band. Then I bought this and was dissapointed. I wish they would have kept their 1st singer because I liked him better. This CD isn't bad, it's just that...it's not very good either."
5,Know your own mind,"A fantastic insight into the unrecognized power of your mind. Full of anecdotes, it is almost an easy read. If you look beyond the author's personal perspective, this book provides many answers to making your life productive and fulfilled."
1,"Value of the ""Vending Start Up Kit""","Simple stated this product is certainly not worth $99.95. All you get is a ring binder with maybe 50 plastic bound pages containing mostly general information. One area I had been interested in was the need of a licence or permit for vending. This books answer was basically ""check with your local Town Hall"". Great advice! Other data consisted of lists of insurance companys, product suppliers and the like that you can find on the Net or Yellow Pages. Not much help at all. Buy ""Vending Success Secrets"" instead. I returned this book to Amazon for a refund."
5,the best game!!!!!!,i bought this game a few years back and it was the best playstation game i have ever played. its perfect for people who love monsterous creatures and solving puzzels.you can play as jill valentine or chris redfield. they are to stars members investigating a mansion after the alpha team turns out missing. i recomend this game to everyone
5,The Game That Made Me Buy A Playstion.,"Resident Evil is a mixed blend of action, role-playing, and horror. Imagine playing a horror movie, or even better, your scariest nightmare in a video game. Imagine playing a game that is so scary, you can't sleep at night without thinking about it. That's Resident Evil. This is one of those games that needs to be placed in the Hall of Fame. This is truly a classic!"
5,Still the best of the RE games,"This is truly one of the greatest games ever made! Forget the remake,the original has that B-Horror movie flavor that tastes goood! This is one of the most important games ever! It's got a scary soundtrack,2-D texture maps with polygonal 3-D characters(which were at the time considered revolutionary),intriguing puzzles and an involving storyline! What more could you ask for? A Next Gen console game? Good luck! Cause your next Gen consoles don't make em' like these anymore!"
4,Zombie.Scary.Bang.Dead.,"A series of gory attacks in the area surrounding a remote biotech lab brings in S.T.A.R.S. (Special Tactics and Rescue Squad) to investigate. On arrival, Bravo Team communications are abruptly cut off. Now it's up to your Team. You arrive at the isolated mansion under-powered and on the run. Arm yourself with anything you can find: knives, pistols, shotguns, flame-throwers - search for hidden rounds to stay alive! There are puzzles to solve, traps to disarm and mysteries to uncover while trying to avoid a blood-bath with the freaks of nature that populate the mansion. Each lurking horror you survive will bring you closer to the source of the Resident Evil."
4,Thank God for TCM,"This movie and another with Barbara Hershey, ""The Pursuit of Happiness""(1971), deserve at least a basic DVD treatment. There are so many entertaining films from that late 60s, early 70s era which I fear will be forgotten soon.The only place you can see a lot of these movies is TCM. Why can't they print their own DVDs? Even if you had to special order them and they had to be pressed by request, I would pay for it. I think a lot of other people who spend their time like me searching for old films would also."
4,My Review,"Great Book. It's got humor, parts when you don't know whether to laugh or cry, and best of all leaves a place in your heart. it's a must read for everyone"
3,Cool looking but lacks paddaing,I have worn these gloves on two occasions. They look good and they don't turn your hands black like some other gloves. When that paintball hits you right between the knuckles watch out because there is a lack of padding in that area.
1,no result,"this good no result, I drink it follow the instruction day 1,2,3 but no result.at the 4 day, I drink all make finish one bottle, but still the same. nothing happen"
1,"soap operatic, tedious, poor writing","I don't know which is worse, the author's sneering tone or the soap operatic situations that move the so-called plot.Mars-Jones (I pray that this is a stage name) strains to be hip but fails. I gave up about halfway through this exercise in tedium, so forgive me if the book suddenly got interesting just when I tossed it (but I seriously doubt the author could have found his way by then)."
1,"Interesting idea, poorly implemented","Don't let nostalgia cause you to buy this game. When people say it's hard to play, they mean it!I adore Lemmings games. I've played them all, and this is pretty much the only one I gave up on without completing.The controls are a mess. Much of the challenge here is just figuring out how to move around in 3D and view what's happening. This was a very early Playstation game - and it shows."
5,Good book for OFDM,"This is one of the best book regarding OFDM technology on the market. Its description of the OFDM and its history is concise, accurate, and intuitive. Lots of articles are cited, which is helpful for further studies. Also, the related industrial standards are referred, which make it a very practical reference, especially for the engineers in this field. It is basically product-oriented without too much rigid mathematical derivations. Whereas, it is not a book for beginners."
3,Its ok,"This coffee pot makes a quick cup of coffee and it comes out hot. I love the convenience of having a dispenser. My problem is that it doesn't seem to matter what my ratio of coffee to water is, it always seems to come out weak. I've tried different coffees, loading up on grounds...nothing seems to make a difference. Today I put 2 cups of water and 4.5 tablespoons of dark roast coffee grounds and I got watery coffee.Update (9/12/09): Apparently the valve that releases the coffee failed, because I walked into my kitchen and my counter was covered in coffee. It lasted me about 2 years, not long enough in my opinion."
4,Devoted to this brand ... and surprised at my new one.,"Despite all the bad reviews on this brand in the past, I am hooked on it. I like the way it brews, and I like the taste of the coffee. We've had a couple of these previously, and after a couple years, they developed leakage problems at the spout, requiring replacement. This is my third one. When I got it, the first thing I noticed was that Hamilton Beach had made some design modifications with this one. There is now a yellow washer around the spout, inside the coffee container, as well as a filter situated over the spout, which I assume was implemented to address the leakage problem with previoius versions. They even included a bag with a couple replacement washers for the spout. No problems so far, and with the design changes, I'm optimistic about this one."
5,Best coffee maker I've owned,"I've had a Brewstation for years, and I love it. It keeps the coffee hot, and it always tastes so good. The only problem I have ever had, and this seems to be a common problem, is the plastic handle inside cracked and broke. It's only a minor problem, that doesn't affect the pot itself."
2,"Great concept, not so great execution","I received this as a gift about six months ago, and I was thrilled because I am something of a Decanter Terminator--I am always managing to drop them or crack them or destroy them somehow. However, the plastic tank that replaces the decanter here is not dishwasher safe. I rinse it every time I use it, but it stains very easily so now I can't tell from the outside how much coffee is left. Also, the little white valve thingy at the bottom of the tank is warped or something now. Jiggling and pressing it back into place works only temporarily. I now have to keep a small cup wedged under the spout while brewing or I get coffee all over the countertop. I pulled my old glass decanter coffeemaker out of the cabinet to start using again.I understand this is an early-model Brewmaster, so these two issues might have been corrected. I hope so."
2,it leaks,"I have purchased (2) of these coffee makers in the past year. I love the coffee maker, but after owning it for a short period of time, it starts leaking all over the counter. I have followed the instructions, but it still leaks all over the counter. If it wasn't for that the coffee maker would be great. I loved my first one, but it leaked, so I thought I would give it another chance, but it happened again."
2,Bitter coffee,"I purchased this coffee-maker a few months ago and love the way it works, not having a glass carafe makes it easy, however, I am disappointed in the taste of the coffee. I am using the same kind of coffee as always, I am measuring accurately, but I always get a bitter after taste to the coffee. I am going back to my old krups which always makes a great tasting coffee."
3,From Good to Bad,"I've purchased seven of this model coffee maker for my office over the past three years. We usually run two pots each day, all day long, so they got some heavy use. The first two lasted about a year and the next two lasted about 18 months. The next two began leaking fairly quickly, one so bad I had to return it and get a replacement. The replacement also began leaking fairly quickly. What happened? Different parts or different manufacturing process? Don't know and don't care, but we did get tired of constantly wiping the countertops, so we bought a Bunn VLPF."
3,Reliable but BIG,"This thing is not for the avg. kitchen, it's a behemoth.It's been reliable for 3 years, however."
1,Defective!,The Coffee maker leaked right away. Contacted Hamilton Beach for a return;they had never heard of Ameridepot(the vendor). Hamilton Beach sent a Model 48464 but we had to pay a shipping fee for them to send it. Lost money and time on the deal. Very unhappy with the whole transaction. At least the new model does not leak.
1,Good coffee bad machine,"We gave this to my dad and his wife for christmas. They praised the delicious coffee. Easy to use, easy to clean. UNFORTUNATELY, the thing has had to be replaced four times! The brewstation just stops working. Hamilton Beach is very nice. All you have to do is clip off the plug mail it in and they will send you a brand new brewstation that will die very soon. It wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't suppose to be a nice gift to two good people who can't afford something like this. And then every time the manufacturer sends a new brewstation, it works great, for a bit."
4,Worth the Price,"My pot worked well, but as others have said after a while it leaks. I found if you run coffee cleaner through it as recommended it will not leak, I believe the problem is from hard water buildup on the rubber seal."
2,Leaks,I thought this product was great at first but after a few months it started leaking. After a few days of coming home to a coffee covered counter I went out and bought a Mr. Coffee. This one is not worth the mess.
5,Simple to use,"I have had this for well over a year and it works great! Makes good fast coffee, timer works as specified and keeps the coffee hot for a long time. The only suggestion is to make sure you clean the nozle where the coffee comes out because soemtimes you may get a coffee grain wedged in there to make it leak slightly. Other than that it is perfect."
3,Unique design & conveinent,"Love the fact that there is no glass pot to clean. REally like the way it dispenses coffee. Unfortunately have had it for about 2yrs now & the power button has broke. Only brews 2cups at a time so I am looking for a new coffee maker. Not fond of this brand but for the cost & use, it was good while it lasted."
2,A Great Coffeemaker,"I'll be replacing mine after six years of trouble-free operation. Can't ask for more than that. Unbelieveably easy to clean & convenient to use. I discovered a trick to getting the coffee to come out hotter: First, run a batch of water through the machine. That gets everything hot before the coffee brews. Also, have hot water sitting in your coffee cup while brewing.UPDATE 9-23-12: TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. The coffeemaker started pausing when I would turn it on. Then it completely stopped pumping the water. So it worked for one year. I don't know who's making them now, but the quality isn't there any more (like so many products today). I contacted Hamilton Beach & they ""offered"" to sell me another one at a small discount & with their ridiculous shipping costs added, it would cost MORE than a store's price. I said, ""No thanks."" For the way it worked for one year - 5 stars. For durability & customer service, I'm being rather generous taking off three stars."
1,Help,Love the coffee pot. Had one just like it but now need the coffer holder as this one leakes right where the coffee comes out. Maybe it didn't get sealed good when it was made. Where can I get just the holder for the made coffee.
2,Kind of boring softcore coming of age flick,"This review is for the Amazon VOD rental of this film. The story line isa young man gets taught the ways of love by an older woman. I think thisfilm fails on a lot of levels. The film trys to be arty with the dialoguebetween the two leads but it is just boring. I have a hard time believinganyone talks like that while having sex, in Argentina or any where else forthat matter. There is pretty much wall to wall nudity but the film is justnot very erotic. Antonella Costa is a beautiful woman and looks fantastic inthe buff but that can't make up for how boring the film is."
4,Foreign film review,"Absolutely awesome and a delightfully romp through sexual challenges of young adults.Totally inspiring for all ages I guess, thanks!"
5,Beautiful tantric film,"Being a student of tantra, I loved this film's story about beginning the path of tantra. It encourages us to dive into sexual bliss, and to find a deeper understanding of ourselves."
1,Can't remove them,"BMW sells these only in plastic now. Over time, they will fuse with your tire stem. I paid $70.00 a tire to have them removed and add new stems to my tires."
1,Can't remove them!,"I have to use pliers to remove them every time. They stick quite easily after a car wash, or currently, in the cold weather."
1,Interminable,"Regrettably, this book is far less than anyone could reasonably expect. Far from providing any insights to the tumultuous events of 1918 and the lead up to the Armistice, the book is a turgid rendition of confusing details. Indeed, it took great patience to reach its end.Thus, in light of the above, I cannot recommend this book to any general reader. Be advised, seek facts elsewhere."
3,So-so.,"This was one of the handfull of books I took to amuse myself flying from Sydney to Hawaii in June this year, I got nauseous and nearly puked, the cabin of the A330 seemed was rolling upside down with my stomach, but I dont really entirely blame this book for this, Id say that reading several hours in flight is not a good policy for me, maybe no matter which book. I grabbed for the barf bag several times felt just like an actual WW1 soldier grabbing for his gas mask when they yell Gas! Gas!!. False alarm, for me anyway. No Phosgene, no puke.It did disappoint me a little, is not as involving a non-putdowner as some WW1 narratives. Its nicely presented as other reviewers have said, probably for the intermediate WW1 student, which is probably my level, a good gift idea, but I would recommend something like ""TO THE LAST MAN, Spring 1918 "" as a more entertaining and insightful alternative, even though the terms of reference are in common but narrower time-frame."
2,I don't know who released this or why,"I'm a huge OCS fan but i refuse to buy this. With their studio albums, a best of, an anthology and numerous live CDs, all of these tracks are available.There doesn't seem to be any thought as to why these tracks have been chosen. They are neither rare, chronological, best sellers or well, anything. The jacket shows Damon, who wasn't even in the band when this was released. Someone is cashing in here and it smells a lot like the record labels.If you're new to OCS then I'd recommend starting withMoseley Shoals. If you have a few albums then you'll already have these tracks and they sound better played on the albums they belong."

5,A GREAT DIBISON WANNEBE,"I GOT GUN BLASTER ON SUNDAY AND HE IS A GREAT ZOID!! HE MIGHT BE A DIBISON WANNEBE BUT I LIKE HIM BETTER THAN DIBISON BECAUSE OF THE ANKLYOSAURUS TYPE, I LOVE DINOSAUR TYPES LIKE THAT.HE GOT A 5 IN EDUCATION BECAUSE IT SHOWS WHAT AN ANKLYOSAURUS WITH TOO MANY GUNS LOOKS LIKE.HE GETS A 5 IN DURABLITY BECAUSE NONE OF HIS GUNS FALL OFF(IT TOOK ME LONGER THAN 30 MINUTES BECAUSE THE GUNS WOULDN'T MOVE).OVERALL A GREAT ZOID!!!!"
2,Too elementary,"This book is basic...too elementary to be much more useful than plain common sense. You don't need a manual to exchange tubes, replace fuses, change cords...etc. It is, however, clearly written and well organized. Possibly useful for a player lacking even basic knowledge of electronic devices."
3,what a good book but poor choice in typesetting,"a book covering many interesting topics and i believe a student of turbulence will be very well-equiped in the basics of modern understandings of turbulence after reading this book. but what a poor page layout. the fonts are small and the book undoubtedly is bulkier because so much space is wasted on the wide margins! i think i had read somewhere that these margins would make the book a good study tools. readers can write on them. what nonsense! they could have just used a conventional layout, save plenty of pages and reading it would be better for my eyes. i can write notes and work out the equations, etc, on some notepad i have. i think it worths minusing two stars for the layout. you can say i judge this book by its font size."
5,Dated but still fun!,"Simply put, I purchased this game upon release for the original PlayStation in October 1995. I still have the game, and still play it on occasion. If that's not a solid ""thumbs up"", I don't know what is.Fair warning, if you have a decent-size HDTV, this game is going to look terrible on it, because the resolution was meant for 1995 tv's. That aside, the game is still as fun as it was the day it arrived in arcades."
3,"LACKLUSTER SEQUEL, BUT THIS IS THE BEST VERSION OF IT","THIS IS THE BEST VERSION OF MORTAL KOMBAT 3. THIS VERSION HAS GOOD GRAPHICS AS WELL AS SOME NICE FATALITIES AND NICE LOOKING STAGES, BUT THE SOME OF THE FUN AND SOME OF MY FAVORITES FROM THE FIRST 2 GAMES AREN'T ON THIS ONE. IT WOULD'VE BEEN BETTER IF THE MASKED NINJA SUB-ZERO WAS PUT ON HERE. THIS UNMASKED VERSION AIN'T AS FUN. AND, THE BABALITY IS VERY STUPID AND POINTLESS. BUT, THE PIT FATALITY IS THE MOST GRUESOME PIT FATALITY OF THEM ALL! YOU ENTER IN THE CODE FOR THE FATALITY, AND YOUR CHARACTER UPPERCUTS HIS OPPONENT, BUT INSTEAD OF YOUR OPPONENT JUST FALLING TO THE BRIDGE, HE FALLS OFF THE BRIDGE AND INTO THE PIT AND HIS BODY GETS CUT UP BY A GROUP OF ROLLING SPIKES!!! AN OK GAME TO PLAY IF YOU'RE INTO FIGHTING GAMES. BUT, FOR A BETTER EXPERIENCE, PLAY ULTIMATE MORTAL KOMBAT 3 ON THE SEGA SATURN."
4,Some beautiful moments!,"Kirsty's BBC sessions elicits some gorgeous tunes, like ""Still Life"", truly one of her all-time best songs that is not on ""Galore"" or any of the others I've come across. ""Let's Have Another Baby"" is very upbeat and fun(and Kirsty's impromptu giggle in the middle always makes me smile). ""Don't Come The Cowboy"" gets a very fresh, very nice reworking here(it's much slower and sadder than the studio version)and Kirsty as always is beguiling on the title track, one of her best songs. I'm one of the guilty people who waited too late to discover Kirsty, but if you're like me you have a lot of catching up to do. Find this one when you can, but perhaps after you're familiar with her studio output. It's delicious frosting!"
3,Puzzle,"I wish the size of the puzzle was on the box. Also,all the pieces were the same shape so the made it a little hard to put together. I did receive the item really fast."
4,Good CD for people who like all kinds of metal!,"How can you go wrong with 38 groups and songs of what's happening in metal and alternative of today. The only thing I don't care about these MTV CD's are that they're edited for cursing and they don't tell you. If you want the original version of a song you like, you have to buy the CD it's off of. But other than that, you have 2 1/2 hours of headbanging that will keep you busy on those slow days."
4,GREAT,I LOVE MY TOTAL GYM AND THESE VIDEOS ARE AWESOME. THEY ARE EASY TO FOLLOW AND I FEEL GREAT AFTER DOING THEM
1,Disappointing,"I am a PhD student in Portuguese history, and also the daughter of Azorean immigrants, and I have to say that I found this book lacking in any real historical work. The main thesis of the author is that the Mellungians have descended from Portuguese immigrants who inter-married with this tribe. His only evidence is to show pictures of Portuguese people and then compare them to pictures of Mellungians, hoping to show that similarities in facial features will prove his thesis. If you are looking for a book on Portuguese History, buy a History of Portugal by A.H. Oliveira Marques. It's much better. The author of this book is not even a historian."
1,cheap soapy scent,"I love Perry Ellis products for men. But if you buying for a woman, and you love sophisticated feminine scent, light and intriguing - don't buy this perfume. I applied a tiny amount and realized that it was a mistake. If you like Armani ""Code"", ""Blue"" by Ralph Lauren, Lancme ""Attraction"" then Perry Ellis ""Portfolio"" is not your style."
3,Portfolio By Perry Ellis For Women. Eau De Parfum Spray 3.4 Ounces,"Stars are base on the price and appearance of the product.My sistes likes it but doesnt love itYes, I recommend this perfum to all girls..."
2,cookies,"I am not too happy with this, the cookies are supposed to be covered in white powder, the powder is now brown, you have to buy in a large quantity and I can't send back the item after I saw and was not happy with it."
3,They were OK but not like the homemade ones,The cookies are a little dry and not a lot of taste. They are not like the homemade ones as the taste is lacking.
1,Ain't what they used to be!,"The Keebler Danish Wedding Cookie just isn't what it used to be. It used to be sinfully delicious - now it's just another sweet, tasteless, nothing of a cookie. It's just a shame, too. I ate these as a child. I bought a box today and ewe - somebody cut corners somewhere - they just don't have the flavor they used to."
4,I miss Sweet Valley Too!,"This book was great, but I miss SWEET VALLEY so much. I hate it that Jessica betrayed Elizabeth, I miss it when they are together."
5,Does Anyone Out There Miss Sweet Valley??,"I liked this book, I really did. It was very interesting, fun, and kept you reading. It basically continues with Lavinia and Max's engagement, and more adventures for Vanessa, Sarah (with Nick), and Elizabeth at Pennington House. I'd recommend it to anyone that likes the SV series. But my question is: does anyone out there miss Sweet Valley? Please, please, please, if you do, just write me a little note at the end of one of your reviews to let me know that I am not the only one! I really want to know what happened to Isabella, Nick, Danny, and Denise after the entire Clay DiPalma tragedy. Plus, I just think that the books should focus on both twins, not just Liz. It isn't that I don't like Liz, it's just that I'd like the books to be well-rounded and discuss both twins' situations. Does anyone out there agree? Please, let me know!!"
3,Go back to uni Elizabeth,I still have not finished this book.Its not exactly that I dont like it but I am uninterested in Chloes sexual decisions.I would rather Elizabeth go back to uni in the usa instead of carrying on in that stupid castle.
5,Cute anklet!,"I love this anklet. It's simple, but just enough for me. I also have a matching necklace. It goes with both my white and yellow gold jewelry, so it's versatile as well. It's definitely more of a dainty looking anklet, but pretty strong (I'm pretty hard on my jewelry)."
1,Too fragile,The ankle bracelet was very pretty but very thin and hard to see when on. It is so delicate that the clasp came undone the first time I wore it and I have not seen it since. Am very disappointed.
2,Deconstruct me one more time (yawn),"A depressingly predictable exercise in applying sub-sub-sub-Derridean critical methods to the novels of Thomas Pynchon. Pynchon, like the rocket that describes the arc of his most famous novel, deconstructs himself so explosively that it's hardly necessary for others to do it for him. The best writing about Pynchon has generally been starkly elucidatory in nature - these boys take Pynchon's already dizzyingly intricate web and dissolve it to a stupefying fog. No wonder it's out of print. Kind of fun, anyway, for the sheer shooting-oneself-in-the-foot futility of it all."
2,"Too much ""big band"" orchestration","I didn't care for the ""big band"" sound with the Christmas music. I guess I prefer a more peaceful type of Christmas music."
5,Liger Zero,A great model kit after built it walks on the floor still have not got the jaw right yet about 1-3 hours to build depending on you.
4,Liger Zero,"I saw the cartoon and I like the Liger Zero. My favorite is Schnider. I wish that the rest of the parts were available so I can get them too, but I will settle for the Liger Zero as soon as it comes out."
5,Another zoid review,"This is Liger Zero,Liger has 4 armors total. He has the Zero Armor,the Shnieder Armor,the Jager armor,and last but definetely not least the Panzer Armor. Bit Cloud is the pilot of this zoid. I personally think that Liger Zero is the best zoid ever. This zoid is electric, meaning he has a switch instead of having to wind it up. I recommend you get this zoid as soon as you can, but make sure it's not your first because you need more experience for this one."
5,LIGER ALL THE WAY!,This Zoid and the shadowfox are tied for being my favorite Zoids.I just love this Zoid's interchangable parts plus not one person I know doesn't know about this Zoid.
5,rocks the house,"The Liger Zero is my second favorite of my four models(Liger, Zaber Fang, Dark Horn, and Shadow Fox). It is the biggest and longest zoid I have. It only has two guns. A tail monted laser and a double barrel shock cannon. It is very fast but does not walk well on carpet. If you were getting your first zoid DO NOT GET THIS ONE!!! It is a great zoid."
3,Liger0,"This was the very first zoid I built.It only took me about an hour to make it.I really had a hard a time though,but it's pradticly the only zoid I haven't managed to break.I don't really like it since it only has 2 guns,and when ever it walks it makes a really annoying sound.Plus when it walks it leans to one side then the other.But, I very happy since Japan makes this stuff I could probavly get all the componets for it since this summer I'll be really close to it.At least there's one thing I can look foward to when I get the Panzer unit the whole thing won't cosaplape on me(well at least I hpoe not). Here's a list of things this zoid dose and the pilot.Stike Lazer ClawGun shot7th Blade attackBlade attackHidrige cannonMega BombPilot is Bit Cloud.This zoid will accect no one else but him.Has an organoid system.Part of the Blitz team.Hope this was helpful to ya."
4,the L0 is awesome,"easily one of the best toys i own. it can walk, chomp, and run into things. u can take it apart and put it back together. its easy to build and looks cool to. if u dont have it yet get it."
5,LIGER ZERO ROCKS!!!!,Well... liger zero was my first zoid i got (only have two...). ITS a MUST GET ziod you(if you want to be a serious model kit builder). Well any way when i got zero(for my birthday) it took me two days! I know its pitaful but that was then and now ... oooo nevermind! So when i finished i turn it on and it made this clicking noise and then its leg came off! It still does that so i dont give it very high on durablity. I suggest to get the different armors for zero like Panzer... IT really makes your collection look nice. So that pretty much anwser it all.
5,liger rules!!!!!,Next to dinosaurs the liger rules! The liger has plenty of cool features!features:1.posible body.2.nice color scheme.3.good durability.4.very fast & plenty of other things.Try to get liger0 when they are in stock because they are practicaly flying of the shelves.Be sure to get them!
4,Liger Zero isn't the best Zoid,Liger Zero is a great Zoid. But until the armors get here it doesn't realy have any weapons. So I suggest the Shield Liger or gun sniper. The Shield Liger has 21 guns and the Gun Sniper has 24 guns.
5,Liger Zero,"The Liger Zero is my favorite zoid. It's very cool, you can take off all of it's white armor leaving it looking very cool. It doesn't have very many weapons on it. But the strike lazer claw attack makes up for that completely. It's boosters look really cool and the gun on it's tail can be very useful. I can't wait for the Panzer, Schneider, and Jager units for this zoid to come out in America. Overall this is a really great zoid. The Liger Zero, Command Wolf, and Shield Liger make a great team to use in battle."
5,Who else than Liger to win me over!,"Drool...get a glass of water before you even think of building this, youll be dehydrated. The mobility is slim to none, but the windup makes up for it and then some. Soon to be joined by three other armors, this is already a great zoid."
5,this zoid is 1 u have to get,i love this zoid it is soooooooooo coolwith all the parts u can buy to make it look even betterit is truely a must have sooo if u dont have 1u better get it fast
5,Zero ManIA!!!!,"Hey every1! I cant believe i found a lyger 0!! This zoid is just about the same size of the sheild lyger. Every1 that said 0 is faster than sheild,was right.I suppose it's because 0 runs on 2 batteries. It was between hard and easy for building it. it took me 1 1/2 hrs. What's kewl about dis zoid is...EVERYTHING!! the armor can come off & he can just run ""naked"" O that reminds me... THE 3 ARMORS FOR LYGER IS COMING OUT THIS SUMMER!!(YAY)It also has pull out thingis when it does the strike razor claw. It has a small gun on it's tail, and on it's stomach. the only thing that stinks is that it realy doesnt have any main guns like the command wolf or sheild lyger. It also has adjustable boosters on it's back. All in all, this zoid rocks!!"
5,Liger 00,"Since it is my favorite zoid, I can't help but like it. Can't wait for the other upgrades to come out."
5,10 Year old model-master,"This Model Is awsome!! This was the first Zoid Model I got, But i reccomend that start slower. This is a great interchangable modle because of the 4 different armers you can equip it with, the basic Zero armer, the Jager, the shneider, and my favorite, the panzer. If you herd they are not selling american armor, I'll let you in on a little secret! ..."
5,LIGER ZERO IS AWSOME,"This is a very fun toy. I only have two Zoid models and they are Zero, and Iron Kong. the reason I gave a five is because it is very mobile and it is fun to play with.I only gave the Zero on educational value, because it fairly easy to build. Plus its not like you're building a sky scaper. I gave a 5 for durability because It never falls apart(exept when I first turned it on, all of the legs fell off.)WELL I hope you like this review. I aslo hope you want to buy this model because Is awsome"
4,bit clouds zoid.,This zoid is my favorite zoid that i hav.It has a dobl gun barrel on its stomik. and a gun on its tale.It allso has two roket boosters.And two wing like stablisere.On the sides of its head it has two things that flip out like win BIT uses his strik layser klaw.Its a grate zoid if you wont a good zoid the liger zero is the one you shood get.
4,The fast kat,"The Liger Zero is a good Zoid it was eazy to build and easy to put on other armor and all that good junk anyways. I like the way it looks i would give it a 6 if they asked how it looked. I have friends that own Zoids and we ""play"" fighte with them and i have always won. One of my friends has tons of Zoids and we battle he also has the ""FAST KAT"" and we love to duke it out with them. So i have have shared and all in all i think that this is a fine hunk of KILLING POWER and dont forget to tune in to Zoids at 4:30 on channel 42 dont let it die some kids need this stuff like ME and i dont want to see them go away"
5,Liger Zero KICKS,"Liger Zero is the coolest zoid model (next to the Shadow Fox). It was also pretty easy to build. It took me about 1 1/2 hours to build, and it was the first model I've ever built, PERIOD! The liger Zero completely holds my team (the max x team)together. My Liger Zero (by it's self) has almost convinced my best friend to start his own team, and he hasn't even seen the thing! I watch Zoids every week day at 3:30 pm central time. I am going to start watching the 5:00 am show soon as well. Here is a list of weapons that the normal Liger Zero armor comes with:1.Strike Laser Claw2.Hybrid Cannon (located under the belly)3.Gun located at the end of the tail ( never used in the show)4.Blade attack5.7 blade attack6.plus much more with the jager, schneider, and panzer armors ( which i do not have, but are getting soon)I hope this reveiw was helpful to you, thanks for reading!P.S.- This is the must have Zoid that will improve your battle record significantly!"
4,Liger Zero,"i love this toy but it's legs fall of and it is hard to build,but when you are done it is a good toy!"
3,Zoid good idea bad design,"They are a neat idea, but too fragile of a design.THe legs on the Liger Zero are only attached to the body at one point and so have a tendency to fall off. Second the plastic used in these models is very brittle. You have a toy that is supoosed to be able to fight and do battle but the model is so fragile that you have to be gentle with it."
5,LIGER ZERO,"I think that the liger zero is the best of them all. When I was putting it together, I just couldn't put it down. I didn't even want to do my homework. There is two problems with this exctrem toy. One is that the plastic is thin, so I used a pair of scissors to cut the pieces out. None of mine broke. The ziod is my first and I have the command wolf coming in the mail. I would say that you should try the others kits firstbefore you do this one because this one is hard. I did have a little trouble putting together the jaw. The other problem was that the jaws on my ziod are sopost to move, but they don't. Even though it has 2 problems, I still think this is the BEST ziod of them all."
4,------------------------------------------------------------,"this toy is a pretty good toy but the peices are fragle and will break easly with a little force so be carful............bot it is realy fast because the moter is powered by 2 triple a batries.you can also go to ebay.com and find transformation parts for it(yager,sniter,panzer) so you can have more fun with it."
4,The Liger zero,"You know whats annoying? People who claim to be zoids experts. Nobody is. (...) Still, its not too bad a zoid. It was fun for the few hours it took to build. The only downside I can see is that its kinda small, and it's walking isnt very good. Once the armor units come out, I'll look good with the schneider armor. (...)"
5,The Best Zoid On Planet Zi,"I just got liger zero a few days ago and im still playing with it today!!! This is the best zoid to get. Its the only zoid that can change into different units like Panzer, Snchieder, and Jager. I cant wait till summer when these parts will come out for the motorized liger. i also have gun sniper, raynos and shadow fox."
5,liger reveiw,"yea it's fun to play with , and teaches alot about mechanics, and is pretty durable, but it doesn't go very fast and looks weurd when it walks. what we need is a kool schnieder ( the orange liger) model that would be awsome"
4,Liger Zero,"I think this zoid is not as good as it could be. Sure it's cool, but there are just two weapons, one on the tail and one under its belly. It's legs come off while walking, and it walks in circles. Also, the armor falls off a lot. But as soon as I get allowance I'm getting the Schneider transformation parts. And that should be soon. This zoid was the second zoid I put together...so I had no experience, except for gundams, which don't walk, are poor quality, the peices snap in half, and they are all exactly the same except they are different colors and have different weapons. So this zoid took me a while and I got frustrated a lot, so I recommend this zoid for people who are more experinced with zoids..."
4,Cool Man!,"I like this one because it is easy to build and very fun, But the leg armor falls off easily."
4,Liger Zero,"Out of my three zoids the Liger Zero is without a dout my favorite. I'm leader of the Beast Fangs Team, a Zaber Fang, a Command wolf, and a Liger Zero (soon to include a gun sniper). The Liger is the best and the strongest of my zoids, but the least durable. The more expensive a zoid is the more noise it makes when it moves (and the more of a chance that the plastic's going to be coarse.) All in all it's a great zoid."
4,easily sustains battle damage,"okay this was my first zoid kit I put together, so it took me quite a while, 5 hours.Not durable! buy a spare kit for the lost parts! my rottie bumped the table it was on and my Liger fell, and battle damage in the form of missing paw.instructions are not entirely correct, when put together how the diagram shows for the back legs it won't walk, infact it will fall appart.All in all, put it in a display case and make sure its outta the reach of small hands, dogs, cats, windstorms and anything else for battle damage.but it does look COOL."
5,Liger Zero Rocks!,"Liger Zero is an awsome zoid! I got him about 2 days ago. It's really fun! It's stable but its parts sometimes fall off. But other wise its awsome. Here are advantages and disadvantages.Advantages1.Easy snap on armor so when the Jager,Panzer,and Shenider Units come to stores you can put them on fast.2.Walks realisticly3.C00L designDisadvantages1.Feet and armor often fall off.I really recommend this zoid. It rocks overall. If you see one be sure to get it they go quick.(Mine was the last one in the store I went to.)"
4,None,The Liger Zero is pretty cool toy. and it's pretty fun putting it together.hehehhe they guy who owns the Liger Zero is named Bit Cloud :-D...
3,It so-so...,"I have a liger zero, and its cute and all. But I think it is really a pain. Everything falls off al over the place (including its head...). But my friends liger walks, parts stay on....Just BUY IT! See for yourself! Go to media play, they usually have zoids at 75% off! Its only 8 dollars! If you dont have a Media play buy it here"
5,jager and schnieder and panzer oh my,"liger is a very good model and is phisically indesructable and i can't wait until it's three armor componants jager, schnieder, and panzer come out than i would lke to see somebody say that it is stupid or corny"
2,Standard Cataloging Book Review,"I have rated the Standard Cataloging textbook with 2 stars. The information was not ""user-friendly"" for someone that has never cataloged before. I needed to read the text twice to fully understand what the author meant. The examples were very hard to follow. Each example gave the contents of the examples with bullets, however, for someone that does not know what a CIP data is or looks like, it is difficult to determine which line consists of the CIP data (for example). It would be helpful to have corresponding numbers to match the example given. Then, the information written in the text would make more sense."
1,Review of Standard Cataloging for School and Public Librarie,This textbook in my opinion deserves only one star. It was difficult to read and understand. I had to read other books to get an understanding of simple concepts presented in the textbook. My understanding of cataloging was not helped at all by reading this textbook.
2,Book Review,This textbook in my opinion deserves two stars. It was very complex to read and comprehend. The textbook was not understandable. I had to use online resources to understand easy concepts stated in the text. I would not recommend this text to any future media specialist. The author(s) should re-write the whole book and explain cataloging in simple terms.
1,Uh...,"So incredibly boring. I guess if cataloging is your kink, it *might* be entertaining. Maybe? Probably not."
4,basic cataloging intro,"This is a good basic introduction to cataloging for anyone, not just school and public librarians."
1,I wasn't sure what to expect for the money.,"I have had these mats for a while and wouldn't recommend them. They curl up, warp, and slide all over the counter even with a damp towel underneath . They also don't stand up well to cutting as the knife marred the surface quickly. I should say that all I use them for is pounding cutlets between 2 of them. I purchased another mat from a cooking store and it was $10 for 1 but offers a backing that doesn't slide. It works MUCH better than these."
3,A funny fun game.,"This is one of the first games I ever got for my playstation. I broke it out again a little while ago and replayed it, and I found that its a really fun blast fest, all over again. One of the redeeming features of the game, is that it has a story, a really stupid story, in FMV, luckily crystal dynamics realized it was stupid, and put in a mystery science theatre 2000 aspect to it, and there are the shadows of the guys (no robot) commenting on the FMV. Its really funny. I played it all the way through again just to see the FMV. It has head to head driving/blasting action, as well, and its pretty fun too."
5,Excellent Choice,"This book was a gift to a dear friend who provides vegetables to our home all season long. He had asked for a book that would help him with a few problems he was having in his garden. He told us just last week, I keep the book by my bedside, I have learned so much. Thanks for such a great gift, I wanted to thank him for his generous bounty that he shares willingly with us."
5,Coombs maple candy,This is the best maple candy I have tasted! Others just don't match up to the taste and quality. Reminds me of the maple candy I had when I was a child.
4,I was satisfied with Gunsniper,"When I first received the Gunsniper and built it, it was tiny. But don't get me wrong I still like it but if I were you I'd buy something more complex and bigger. My 2 gunsnipers aren't my favorite Zoids but they are Zoids nonetheless. I enjoy it from time to time."
5,Gun Sniper Rules,"This zoid may look wimpy but it's powerful. It all maters on the pilot and the equipment. All I can say for this zoid is it runs really well but its simple and easy to put together. I do wish that it cold come with more optional components or be easy to find or something. Also Lena, you know the pilot for the Debison but then switched to the Gun Sniper, is a very outgoing girl but she's nice when you get to know her (she's pretty too). Anyway yes, I know bit and them too, and I just want to say I cant believe that I wasn't in the show!( I pilot the Razor claw its not in the show...DARN!)"
4,the gunsniper by me,"I LIKED THE GUNSNIPER ALOT, IT WAS KIN OF HARD TO BUILD BUT THAT'S BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW WICH SIDE TO PUT THE PEICES ON. THE ONLY PROBLEMS OUR FOR SOME REASON NEITHER MY GUNSNIPER OR MY WAR SHARK WILL WALK. NOT LIKE I CARE THAT MUCH ANYWAYS. ALSO ONE OF THE ROCKET LAUNCHERS KEEPS FALLING OFF.ALL TOGETHER THIS TOY IS COOL WHAT I REALLY WANT TO KNOW THOUGH IS WILL THERE EVER BE SOMEKIND OF UPGRADE ON IT TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE THE ONE ON T.V. OH WELL UNTILL THEN I'LL JUST HAVE TO STAY WITH TH ROCKET LAUNCHERS. THAT'S IT I'D JUST LIKE TO END BY SAYING...THIS TOY ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Next Zoid please!!,"Leena and Naomi are my fave pilots in the show and they pilot such a pathetically made Zoid. I have a lot of complaints about this zoid:1)The legs require practically no assembly. They are basically hollow casts with feet attached to them. That makes it VERY unattractive.2)Same problem with the hands, they are very low detail one piece castings.3)The head has some redeeming qualities but the fact that the jaw doesnt open easily or very far is annoying.4)The spring coil on this zoid is incredibly WEAK!! This zoid CANNOT walk. It is very unbalanced.Go buy a Rev Rapter."
5,Rocks,"This Zoid rocks. It is a velociraptor with guns and missile launchers attached to it. The three guns are removable, so you can put them aside when they sort of get in the way. The educational value on this toy is based upon the building of it. My guess is that it's a bit confusing for younger children, but it should be a breeze if you're over eight years old. Also, the durability is amazing. It doesn't break into a million pieces if you accidentally drop it, unlike Legos. This Zoid is one of the greatest and I'm lookin' forward to more."
5,Gun Sniper rocks,"I only have one zoid and this is it. Gun Sniper is really cool and fun to play with. The educational value depends on who is building it, if an 8-year old built it, it would be really educational. It is also very durable, if you drop it on the ground only one of its missle pods drops off. I'm looking forward to more cool zoids."
3,An easy toy to break,"It is an easy toy to break, and when u build it u can easly break it. for a normal zoid it is very short,(about 4 inches(see what i mean!)). but if you are obsesed with Lena from the blitz team on the tv show (like my sister is) get it.This is the truth!!"
5,the GUN SNIPER,YOU CAN MOVE THIS GUN SNIPERS TALL UP OR DOWN. WHEN YOU GET WILD WEASEL UNIT YOU COULD HAVE LENAS GUN SNIPER. IF YOU ARE A BEGINNER YOU WOULD LIKE THIS ON. IN THE GUNS ON ITS BACK IT HAS HAS SOME GUNS IF YOU PRESS THE BUTTON A PIECE WILL POPE OUT BUT IT WILL NOT FLING OUT THOSE ARE ITS JETS. I HAVE THIS ITEM AND 7 MORE TO MY COLLECTION. IT IS A COOL TOY AND MODEL. IT IS A WIND-UP NOT MOTORIZED. IT WAS MY FIRST ZOID I HAD EVER GOT. MY FRIEND CALEN GOT IT FOR ME.
3,hmm well it needs work,if u got this model in hopes of geting leenas zoids yours going to be disaponied in order to get it like leenas you have to get a wezal uint for it beleive me i allrealy have
5,Sweet Zoid,When I got this zoid I Knew it would be a good one. I took me About 25 minuts to put together because I Have a broken finger and it is kinda hard to write this review too. This zoid has an Awesome gun on its tail and two really cool boosters and missle'sthey have 3 guns in the front two on the hands and one on the chest. it is a way awesome zoid If you are just starting out I would get this one Seeya!
3,Gun Sniper,"I got the TOMY Japanese Gun Sniper and...well...it's OK. My Gun Sniper doesn't walk when I wind it up, so it's not very fun. It's not very educational. It's WAY too easy for me and it was my only third Zoid model. Can you beleive it, only third? Really, I don't know how durable it is cuz' I hardle even touch it. But when I was playing with it after building it some parts kep falling off. I recomend it to begginers cuz' it's soooo ez. Really, only get it if you want it as a model. This is kind of a boring model, so I got the Wild Weasle unit for it. Other than that it's not so great."
1,the gun sniper is kewl on the show but this toy is very sad,ok i bought this toy because the gun sniper on both show's are awesome.i did not expect it to be as good as the motorized zoids but this toy gives all zoids models a bad name.it breaks easy.it looks like it's drunk when it walks.(if you can keep it wlaking without it getting stuck)i guess i should buy another and take better care of it maybe if i bought the weasle unit all direction missle pods to pot on it i would like it betterbut if you want to buy a zoids model don't get this one.
5,nice zoid,this zoid just dosent have enough wepons. The missle packs are a nice touch. It could use some close range wepons though. I love the windup key. The new motor with the windup dey works so much better than the average windup motor. over all this is a awsome zoid.
5,gun sniper,"the gun sniper roocks i got the wild weasel uint for mine its for x-mas mine doesnt walk but its still cool (i olso have the liger zero,shild liger,war shark,pters)"
4,gun sniper,"This republic zoid is piloted by a traitor against Van and Zeke. It is also also used by Lena. It is a wind-up zoid that works better with Wild Weasel unit (really fires missiles.) Naomi has one. All and All it's okfrom, Raven of the imperial army"
5,I love this music!,"I love the use of instruments in this CD to play music that soothes the soul. I especially like the song about the Sea World. I have a CD which brings in the sounds of the sea; whales, dolphins, etc., but Celestial Winds duplicates the sounds of the sea using instruments! It sounds so wonderful! I am very pleased and grateful for this CD."
2,Previous Releases Are Better,"Celestial Winds' ""Bliss"" falls into the lackluster category where, unfortunately, much of the ""New Age"" music has fallen over the years. This album sounds shallow and lacks passion. It is missing the dynamics and depth of Celestial Wind's previous releases. David Young's recorders lack melodic ""bliss"", soul-less empty notes, ""muzak"" quality. Rather noticeable is the difference in the harp playing (comparing ""Bliss"" with ""Celestial Winds I"", for instance). Maybe it is the way it was mixed but the sound is rather wimpy, for lack of a better word. There seems to be little enthusiasm or feeling for what is being played by all involved. The musicians seem to be just going through the motions to lay down the tracks. It appears that Celestial Winds is no more but should they decide to re-group, let's hope they can bring the fire back into their sound. In any event, better to purchase the earlier CDs first before this one.2 stars out of 5."
3,"Good, but not great.","I just finished reading this book, and have to say it was good, but not great. I think part of the problem was the bad editing that left a lot of weird sentence structures, and the occasional double word, etc. The overall story was good, a tragic story of a lost, neglected person and his struggles to fit in as he has grown up and ultimately his bad choices leading to worse consequences. If this book had better editing done I think I might have rated this as four stars."
2,Not Hot Enough,"I read previous reviews extolling this Cappuccino Maker, and the price was right for a home pump machine. However, I received and returned my first one because it barely heated the water past lukewarm temperature. I called Hamilton Beach and customer service said temperature should be at least 170 and usually higher. So, I returned the item to Amazon and they sent a replacement. This one was functioning and a bit hotter, but didn't satisfy. I ran a cooking thermometer in the cup and the brew is only 140. I am not impressed with the quality and wonder if we are getting refurbished models as new ones. Also, the machine does not produce crema. I rated the product 2 stars in hopes that my experience is not universal. The second unit is being shipped back and I will look for another brand."
1,You get what you pay for!,"I bought this espresso maker for my husband for Christmas. We enjoyed it for awhile, until it started leaking (just turning it on caused it to leak). We sent it back to the manufacturer, and they sent us a 2nd one.The second one worked ok for about a week, at which point we started having problems with it. This time, no matter how light the tamp, or how course the grind, the portafilter was full and overflowing with water after pulling a shot. I called the company, and they offered no help-just offered to send a 3rd machine. I declined, and am considering purchasing a Rancilio Silvia (about $450.00)I guess I should have spent the extra bucks to begin with!"
2,Deceptive Machine,"This Hamilton Beach espresso machine is sturdy, looks good, and the wand froths well, but that's about it. The espresso has ZERO crema on it, and this results in a bitter, untasty shot of espresso. I tried absolutely everything -- fine grounds, coarse grounds... everything. The espresso flows too fast. Perhaps I bought a lemon, but I would steer clear of this machine.I have since returned my Hamilton Beach, and I bought a Delonghi Treviso, an infinitely better machine. If you are interested in a high-quality, pump espresso machine in this price range, buy the Delonghi."
4,Finally found the one,"I have read review after review, tried and returned machine after machine, and have now finally found the one. This machine works better than anything I have ever tried and, in the few days I have owned it, has already provided cup after cup of outstanding cappuccino and latte. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the lack of room between the drip tray and the spout. None of my current cups will fit so I have had to be creative (I wound up using a low profile, one cup measuring cup). Other than this one minor complaint, it is ideal especially at this price."
5,"Grimm is ""The King of the (Trash) Heap""!","""Possibly the most informitive comic book ever written"" -Me""Five stars, three thumbs up"" -Me""Tells historical information, left out of text books, in a funny way (may not be true)"" -Me&quot..;."
5,Certainly one of my favorites,"After I completed my test, I turned out to be a Physical Tan. I was astonished by how well it described my personality. This book means a lot to me because it made me realize that I'm ok the way I am. I don't have to change anything to be happy. I give my most sincere thanks to Barbara Bowers for writing this book. It's a true gem."
1,Doesn't give a very good summary of colors for quick reading,The use of this book is not for unexperienced aura readers and is not created for quick explinations of colors that you see in the aura. It is long and drawn out and does not cover the many different kinds of colors you may see in someones auras.
1,Waste of time,"I found this book to be a waste of time. I also read Life Colors, which is similar but better written and more uselful."
3,Colour Awareness,Easy to read. well presented. Lots of detail. The test gets you thinking and if you answer it honestly it will lead you to your predominate colour.
1,Very disappointed,I've read many books on aura. This book just contain very limited information on aura. The intensity and the different shades of a color is not even mentioned. I'm thinking about throwing it away.
5,Grand Sophy,At this price I would buy all of Georgette Heyer's books. I have read her books since I was 12 years old and have not found any other author for the regency period as good as her.
5,Brilliant,"This has always been one of my favourite Georgette Heyer books. Sophy is an amazing character. So likeable and endearing. You always end up wondering what she will do next. I love how she tackles all the househld's problems one by one in order to bring about a suitable resolution. Also the other characters in the book are masterfully drawn, Hubert, Charles, the disagreeable Eugenia, beautiful Cecilia, the vague poet and a whole host of others. A fantastic read that you will want to come back to again and again."
4,Delightfully charming,"Find one household with a jovial but irresponsible father with a penchant for gambling, a kindly but easily flustered mother, a daughter engaged to be married but who deems herself in love instead with a poet, a rag tag assortment of other younger siblings, and a grim eldest son, betrothed to an ultra-conservative puritan,and on whose shoulders lie the responsibility of keeping the family in line. Add one independent, intelligent and well-meaning niece into the household and watch the carefully constructed house of cards tumble.A wonderfully humorous caper that will leave you gasping at the audacity of Sophy, smirking when the cold fiancee gets her comeuppance more times than can be counted, laughing at the shenanigans and in awe of the Grand Sophy.Delightful!"
5,The Grand Sophy,"Probably one of Georgette Heyer's best Regency novels. Anyone who's enjoyed Jane Austin will love Heyer. Like Austin she excells at illustrating compelling images of her characters, from those you love to those you love todislike. I've spent thirty years reading novels set in the Georgian and Regency periods and Heyer's aredog-eared from frequent use."
3,disappointed,"hard to understand why in an 18th century English novel the word ""ain't"" is part of the dialogue. ruins the reading experience."
2,Definitely not my favorite,"I have loved most of the other books that I have read by Heyer. However, there are a few that leave me with a bad taste in my mouth. It annoys me that so much of my favorite authors turn out to be racists. I used to excuse this by saying that the writer was a product of his or her time etc. Still, whether or not someone is a product of his or her time still doesn't make them any less racist or prejudices any less wrong. Also, I understand that cousin love was common and marriages in the family were acceptable but it still makes me dry heave. I will continue to read Heyer but I will make sure to stay away from her books about incest!"
3,Not what I expected,"I bought this book believing it was written recently, when it was actually written in 1950. The style of speech was very dated and felt awkward, although maybe realistic for the time period of the book. The story was interesting with many plots which was a nice change of pace, but not what I was expecting based on the other reviews."
5,Great character and a wonderful book!,Sophy is the girl with the spirit you would like to see in every girl! This is one book that you could not bear to put down after finishing the story.
1,Grand Sophy,This book slanders Jews. It is okay aside from that but the tainted portrayal alters one's impression of the author.
3,opposites attract,The charm of this one arises from the outrageous heroine turning the stick-in-the-mud hero's life up-side down. The hero being said stick-in-the-mud detracts a bit from my overall liking of this story but it is told with GH's usual humor and still a very good story.
4,"Very well written, but have a few qualms about ending - spoiler alert","Yes, this book by Heyer is well written and I do prefer it above other books of hers that I have read. The characters were well developed, good banter between them, nice plot, etc. All in all, a very good read that I had a hard time putting down. I will spare you the long, eloquent review and get down to the reason why I gave it a four star rating:SPOILER ALERT1. The two main characters are forever chafing at each other, so it's hard to believe they've fallen into love at the end.2. I know it's trivial, and it didn't seem to bother most of the other reviewers, but it bothered me that the two main characters that fall in love at the end of the novel are first cousins. Not second-cousins-twice-removed-step-sister, etc., but FIRST cousins. I had a hard time finding romance in in-breeding and, even halfway through the novel, still held out hope that the author would introduce a new love interest other than Sophy's cousin. Yuck."
4,So funny!,This book was so funny!!! I LOVED Sophie and all her schemes. My only complaint is that it ended too quickly. I can't believe I haven't heard about Georgette Heyer before now. I can't wait to read more of her books.
4,"delightful novel, except for . . .","I have been a Georgette Heyer fan since the early '70s, and this novel is one of her best. However, I found Hubert's anti-Semitic comment about his brother Charles' stinginess, as well as the usurer Goldhanger character, extremely offensive. In fact, Goldhanger was so stereotypical, combining elements of Shylock and Fagin, that I might have been amused if I hadn't been so offended and saddened. And the novel's postwar, post-Holocaust publication date made this even worse. Hence, I gave the novel four stars instead of five. I only hope Heyer regretted this during her final years."
5,A lot like liking it!,"A cute movie. My son-in-law did some graphic artwork for this movie...his name is in the credits...of course, we had to buy it the poster and frame it! It's hanging proudly! Quality of the poster is what one would expect from a movie poster."
4,fertility aid,"I bought this to regulate my cycles. I take it with herbal teas and a prenatal vitamin (see my other reviews for info). I can't say it definitly does the trick, but I do believe it is helpful."
1,the low down on the warshark\wardick,i dont like this zoid for one good reson i cant deck it out no extra guns no nothing look out [other online store] i be salein this thing soon
4,"Learn, play and get clean too!!",This Zoid is downright fun (...). The Zoids War Shark is a good bathtub toy (it floats-rinse well) with lots of mechanical moves (and no batteries!) and is a marvel to observe on the dining room table. Talk about your anime battle vehicles! What makes it even better is that it is in 1/72 scale.
1,this zoids is bad,well i think this zoids should be able to swim better tahn it does it aslo walks really slow and i really dont like it at all
2,WarShark........,I think this zoid is alright easy to build but not alot of fun. I personally DIDNT REALLY LIKE IT.
4,WAR SHARK,"This is a great zoid. I own it and i love it! Guess what, it actually swims.!!!! This is one of the coolest zoids ever. U wont regret buying war shark."
4,"Battle mode 0999, ready, fight!","Not exactly a Liger Zero, but it's still a fun model kit. I would recommend this Zoid to those who are just beginning their collecting and are having trouble putting models together. It normally takes a half-hour to put this kit together, perfect for beginners."
4,terrior of the sand and sea,"when I finished it, it looked so cool. this thing comes out of nowhere. it attacks from both sand and sea. with its high powered cannons this thing takes a bite out of zoids. I'm getting two more for my own War Shark team"
5,This Toy Is AWSOME,This toy is AWESOME. It's In My FAVORITE TV show.Me and My freind looked and looked for this toy and it's right here.
5,war shark,"this zoid is awesome!!!this zoid can be made for water or for land.ther's not much to say, but this zoid rules!"
4,Sweet!,"This is a cool zoid. When I heard it swims, I thought it was even cooler. Now my Blade Liger has a partner. Ive heard its very durable so I gave it a 5."
4,The Backdraft's Warshark,"It comes from the sea. Being one of the very few aquatic type Zoids, this one carries a pretty good arsenal of weapons: a missle pack, and a hidden weapon, which I'll leave to you to locate ^_^. This one has water absorbing foam so it doesn't leave the Zoid to be full of water. The only downside is he has no upgrade slots. Bottom line, it's a great Zoid."
5,Zoids ultimate review,"The WarShark was my first Zoid and compared to the Comand Wolf he walks better,floats in water,and looks cooler. The only Problem i had was puting the foam block in his head.Also a beginer could build it. U might have problems when puting the parts that hold on the legs."
5,phat fish,war shark is a very fun zoid.it is my first so it started to were out .it has a stronge moter but is kinda slow. it has two big laser cannions a missell pack and a mouth gun.i gave it a 4 because it's tail some times comes off if you play to rugh.it swims good and is easy to build.i have 6 other zoids(dibison raynos sheild liger terris and zaber fang).it is a very good zoid to have an a teem because it can swim and dig very fast.
3,Super Pac Man not the only hit,"This is volume 2 of the five volume set of Namco arcade classics. It includes: Super Pac Man, Xeviuos, Mappy, Gaplus, Grobda, and Dragon Buster. Super Pac-Man is the best of these for those that remember it. Xevious was a great space based shoot-em-up that can be very addictive. However, Grobda was the worst of this lot, just another dungeon crawl with unappealing graphics. If you can find a copy, it might be worth a play or two to relive the classics, especially Super Pac-Man. However, it is =very= hard to get and considered collectible."
2,an okay game,"this collection of games were okay, the best one out of them all was super packman. the rest were not worth playing. :("
2,"usual story, weak characters","This is the typical boogyman story. Would anyone in this day and age let a stranger into their house? I think not. These were weak people and the perfect victims. I, too, was hoping one of them would shake off the confusion that seemed to engulf them, and defend themselves. Oh well, I will not read her stories again."
2,"Over the top...too much information and will Carl and Jesse ever ""grow some?""","I am currently listening to the audio version of this book. The book has it's good spots, but I can't wait to finish it. I find myself skipping portions now to get through the slow agony of wondering when Carl and Jesse are EVER going to regain THEIR sanity and really do something to stop the mentally ill ""visitor"" who mysteriously shows up at their home. It seems like they keep making excuses and rationalizing how they can't stop him. In reality, most people, even more spritely elderly folks would have made more efforts to stop someone from torturing and rape, even though ""he had a gun."" And then the stories of Carl's memories of his ""real"" childhood, is just too much being interspered with crazy Jonah and his bag of torture tricks. I just want this to end."
4,where to buy,"I saw that someone was wanting a copy of this realy feel great movie that you could watch over and over again, a real rarety. Once I saw it I just had to have a copy of my own. After much searching i found a previously viewed copy(used)but guaranteed. Im not allowed to tell you where I got it from (hint its not in australia)but if you search you will find. Hope this helps."
5,I love this movie!,"We've been waiting forever for this to come out on DVD. I still laugh till I can't breathe when they're trying to be inconspicous and they both duck down and it looks like the car is driverless. Maybe I'm pathetic but this and ""Sibling Rivalry"" and ""Soapdish"" and ""Delirious"" all came out at around the same time, and I think they're the most hilarious movies ever. They don't make them like this anymore. This one is my favorite of all of them. Buy it, you won't regret it."
5,Sexy Lobo!!,"I saw this movie a long time ago, and thought that it was the greatest. When I found out it was going to be on DVD I had to see it again. It was even better! I am a huge fan of Steve Guttenberg and I love him as the sexy motorcycle riding Lobo. In the beginning of the movie he is looking really rough, but boy does how look hot with the long blonde hair. This movie is just pure 80's romantic fun!"
4,Ordinary people - extraordinary situation,"This is a favorite for me and my wife. Though not as slick and witty as Hanks and Ryan (who we love), this movie has a chemistry and simplicity that makes it unforgettable. Set in Charleston the story has believable and approachable characters that let you suspend your disbelief just long enough.... A real Romantic Comedy. Lets get it back in PRINT!"
5,Great movie finally coming out on DVD!,"Good news! This movie's coming out on January 24, 2005 on DVD, and it'll be called ""Boyfriend School""! It's such a great, hilarious movie!"
2,Disappointing,"This has the potential to be a really great movie. There are some funny scenes and the general message about not judging on the basis of appearances is good. However, I only give it two stars due to a gross ""sex education"" scene somewhere towards the middle of the film. The characters hopping in the sack together was another reason. So, I ended up donating my copy as I have young children and don't want that kind of stuff in my home. Too bad, though...if they'd just take out the trash, it would be a fun flick."
2,Read the book instead!,"This rather forgettable movie was based on a very hilarious book by a lovely woman named Sarah Bird. The book is called The Boyfriend School, and if you have the time, save yourself and read it instead of watching the movie. I've done both, and would unquestionably recommend the book instead. The movie was originally titled Don't Tell Her It's Me, an odd choice even given the inherent plot reference. I guess if I'd seen the movie only, I might have found it entertaining, but the book was SO wonderful, the movie was just a disappointment."
4,what can I say??,"What can I say, this cheesey movie is fun to watch. Love the way Shelly Long's character talks to her young daughter. And always love the underdog to win in the end. And the main characters are like old friends."
5,love prevails,"this is not your typical rom-com,it is however a feel good movie,i love jamie gertz,and she does an excellent job of acting.the steve guttenburg transformation is nothing short of unbelievable.this movie will not disappoint."
3,A perfect gift for any romance-novel freak.,"This movie was a total surprise to me. Steve Guttenberg was hard to see compared to his beefcake co-stars in the ""Three Men"" movies, but here he commands center stage as a lonely young cartoonist seeking romance. The first twenty or so minutes are painful to watch - I've never known anyone personally struggling with Hodgkins Disease - but his transformation into a biker dude from new Zealand is a joy to watch. My sister is a romance novel fan and I kept thinking of her as I watched Shelley Long apply her ""advice about what women want"" to her younger brother (Long plays a romance novelist in the film). The exterior shots of Charleston are nice. This film is not up there with Schindler's List or anything, but even my husband and 16-year-old son thought it was funny. Good, light humor, and nothing inappropriate for youngsters."
3,The Male Makeover...,"Finally, we get to see a guy change to get the girl for once. All the other movies have a girl going through the Cinderella makeover to get the guy. In this movie, the leading man, Gus (Steve Guttenburg), is transformed by his romance-novel-writing sister, Lizzy (Shelley Long) from a recovering chemo-patient into a Lorenzo Llamas look-a-like. ""Dud to stud in 12 easy lessons."" A comedic romp with not just two, but four great comedic actors."
2,Evil by Design? How nice,"A book I found interesting for art of this period is ""In Morbid Colours: Art and the Idea of Decadence in the Bohemian Lands, 1880--1914"". I don't agree with the authors main thesis period. Evil by Design has a very tasty cover."
4,tasteful reconfiguration of 50's jazz,"Extreme ability to render classic jazz seamlessly. However, it is lacking the cutting edge ""rawness"" of great performers. The performances seem to be a cross between Julliard talent and easy listening."
5,Great for Pasta Salads!,The flavor of this pasta is delicious paired with marinara. And the shape and colors of the noodles make such a pretty pasta salad! High quality organic ingredients. I will be purchasing more soon!
2,They didnt work for my dog,My dog had mites which then caused a fungus infection (I think from all teh product i put in his ear). i ultimately had to go to the vet to get meds
1,Pheromone,this product does not smell very good. I had no response from women. Would note by it again.
1,Molasses...,"I am very surprised to see all of the positive reviews on here. I have twice now tried to start reading this book and got about 15 pages in before canning it. It is painfully slow, repetitive, and mostly obvious. The narrative style just doesn't work for this type of book. And as new faculty, the last thing we need is to trudge through a dull text. I would recommend chapters 10-12 of 'Tomorrow's Professor' by Reis, or the latter half of 'What They Didn't Teach You in Graduate School', both of which are done in an easy-read manner with more practical hints."
1,Fire the proofreaders?,"Although I have not yet read the text, the egregious misspelling of the Latin title, which evidently escaped both the author and everyone who proofread the text prior to publication, is not a good advertisement--at least not for anyone who knows even elementary Latin. The correct spelling of the title should be ""Nihil NimIs"". If I do in fact decide to read the book (I am hardly a ""new"" faculty member), perhaps I'll be inclined to write a more favorable review of its contents. Meanwhile, let's hope that a new printing will correct the spelling error."
4,Not Too Bad,"I've had this gun for 4 months and it still works great. The FAKE silencer and flash hider dont do anything and broke in about ten minutes and the same story with the stand, but it doesnt effect anything. It shoots at about 375 not 390 because it only goes through 1 piece of cardboard and dents another. The cocking mech. is kind of hard to pull back so you cant shoot very fast. This gun is also kind of heavy. The two clips that it comes with hold a lot of ammo. the red dot scope is also useless. It is made of ABS plastic, but dont use it in the winter because if you drop it, its done. the shipping is slow(1 week to ship, 2 1/2 weeks to deliver. Very good gun for 20 bucks."
2,There are much much better guns,"i will try to be as honest as i can in this eview, even though i have seen much better guns. first off, this gun can shoot a mile! it can probably shoot 200-220 feet straight ahead. and you do not want to get hit with this. it hits hard. but, it is not as accurate as other sniper rifles. from 45 feet the bbs start to curve a little bit, so if you get a scope like i did, you cannot zero it. you can however put the impact point of the scope within 3-6 inches of the bb up to about 100 feet. bottom line, save your money up and buy an M324 or a dragunov."
1,Do NOT get!!!!,"What a terrible excuse for a bb gun. It has good accuracey and hits hard. However, when i got it, the bi-pod was broken. The red dot sight that comes with it is not adjustable, and can not be seen in daylight. After a few uses, the bb's started to fall out of the barrel when it was tilted down( not even all the way down). I thought i could fix it so i opened it up. I discovered that all of the metal berrels were rusted completely out. Who knows how long it had been sitting in a factory. Overall, its not worth the money and i would recomend a clear airsoft gun so that you can easily see the broken parts. DO NOT GET!"
1,Don't make the mistake I did.,"Well this is what happened. A couple of weeks ago, I ordered this gun. The next day I recieved an email from from airsplat, telling me it had shipped. Funny thing they did that, because the next day another email from airsplat said that it was out of stock, so I sent an email that said to cancel that order and to replace it with the black one (which was $10 more). The next email says they got my email and they planned on answering it tomorrow. Ha,good one. Several days later, no email. I call them and they tell me they'll send it. A week later I get it, lightly pull the cocking thing........ and it's broke. My dad shakes it, and whadda ya know? A loose piece rattles! All in all stay, away from this gun. I'm currently trying to get a refund."
2,Broke in the first week,"I purchased this for my teen son. Within the first week, the handle, the cocking mechanism, and the stock all broke. Plus the speed loader which came with it broke after the first use. The gun still functions as a gun and shoots powerfully, but what's next to break?"
1,do not buy!!!,"Well,i would be able to give this item a review, but i can't. This componey that ships this item is HORRIBLE!!!! I got a call a week or two after it was going to be at my house that they were out of stock. I left two messages on there phone and never go a responce, so i emailed them another two times and about three days later I go an email back saying that the was not out of stock anymore and was being shiped. Another week pasted no item. I then got another message on my phone saying that my orde has been canciled. what I'm trying to say is that this compony can not ship and are very unrelable. I strongly recomend going two a different componey. It may cost a cupple bucks more but you'll actually get what you asked for."
4,A pretty good gun,"This XM8 gun was a pretty good gun. But the bad thing that happen was that the thing that you cock back broke off the first day:(. I was very dissapointed with this gun, now i use my fingers to cock it back its not imposible but it kinda hurts your fingers. (ITS VERY HARD TO COCK BACK if your under 13). The fps is great it hits 390 fps. it an accurate gun i recommened it."
5,"the best dirty ,grityy blues album possible, unbelievable","this is simply the best album for swinging, dirty late 40's-50's blues , you can't beat this, junior watson ,is one of the all time greatest blues and swing players in the world the band is the best , california's best players this album kills me , and i listen to it every day he's a great singer too listen too franky and jonny absolute filth, at its best , buy this album, if you don't , your mad"
4,her latest,"I've followed H. Mel's books from the very beginning. The character Polly Deacon is sure to be a Canadian superhero. She's different from the rest of the world she lives in as a puppeteer and now as a single woman she's pregnant.In Polly's latest adventure she's traveling to England to present at a puppet conference. She is quickly tailed and her puppet case becomes a constant interest to some looney who pops up in airports, trains and graveyards trying to make off with it! Then a woman, who bares a strong resemblance to Polly --inlcuding pregnancy, turns up dead in a local English church. Will Polly be next?This book isn't Mel's ultimate book in the series but it is a fabulous page turner and well worth the time.If you like to laugh with your heroine and care about her at the same time I highly suggest you start at the beginning of the series and add each book in turn! Her writing is brisk, believable and oh so Canadian!"
5,Great basic cleanser,"This cleanser lathers up nice and leaves your face feeling refreshed, clean and tight, but not dry. I've used it for two weeks now, already see smaller poors and a more radiant and clear complexion and I'm at the age where I still need to worry about preventing acne, and wrinkles (UGH!) You only use a tiny bit, so don't let the price fool you, it's a bargain!"
3,good if you mix it with your favorite other cologne,I like to mix this with my favorite cologne and it does give it a nice compliment. I get comments all the time about how good I smell (but not when I wear it alone).
3,"Guiltless? Why so much salt, then?","I don't understand why a ""guiltless"" baked chip has to have 180mg of salt in 1oz. The commentator who complained about the small amount of oil is missing the bigger issue. The small amount of oil in these chips is healthy oil. It's not really a negative. The negative is this level of salt."
4,Good crunchy chips,"I like these Guiltless Gourmet baked blue corn chip. I can't eat dairy so I can't have the flavored varieties. Even the Black Bean blue corn chips, which are really delicious, have dairy so I depend on this plain variety.I just wish Amazon offered them at a price I could afford."
4,Variations on A Theme,"Okey-doke.If you are buying a copy of the soundtrack to JFK, just realize you're basically purchasing a compact disc with 64 minutes of music that has six repetitions of the main theme as the basic buying feature. The Theme To JFK is one of the most beautiful and patriotic pieces of music that John Williams ever committed to paper. You are going to hear it six times, in piano solo form, and slow adagio form at least twice, and as a concert suite. Add one track of precious theme music, and two or three more tracks of spooky menacing music, and at least six tracks that John Williams did not compose. These non-Williams tracks consists of mostly jazz inconsequential pop music from the early 1960s.If you can get this at bargain bin prices, by all means, go ahead and buy it. But again, you're basically purchasing this for variations on a theme."
3,Not REALLY part of the Kane&Abel saga,"Nice summer reading.Enough suspense to keep you going, and I actually liked the characters!Funny how fast things have changed. Archer gave us a 'modern version' of this book, and it's STILL remarkably out of date. Imagine FBI agents with pockets full of quarters to make phone calls!Not much about Archer's heroine Ms. Kane in here, which was fine. This is a definite ""stand alone"" book in his ""Kane and Abel"" series, dealing with an assassination plot on America's first woman president."
2,Ho hum,"I was introduced to Mr. Archer by his two most recent books, ""Only time will tell and ""The sins of the father."" These were such incredible novels that I went in search of more. By the time I got to ""Shall we tell the President""I found out that some of the best authors can sometimes have clay feet. This is one of those times. This is an ordinary novel which can be put down at any time. For me there were no page turners. It was full of cliches and has a silly love story which adds little to the plot. No surprises at the finish. Could have been written by any number of hacks."
3,HUH?,I don't understand the book description of this novel as it has nothing to do with Florentyna Kane or the families of Kane and Abel. In fact it doesn't even mention them. I found this very misleading and it should be revised to tell the right story.
3,All Depends on When you read it!,"For those of who don't know, Archer has re-released this book as the third and final installment in the Kane and Abel trilogy. While it does have a good and exciting plot, it fails to live up to Kane and Abel and The Prodigal Daughter. If you read this book stand alone, you will enjoy it. However, if you read this book as part of the trilogy, you will come away slightly disappointed. Florentyna is really a minor character in the book and the only really new piece of information that we learn about her is that she defeated a former New York congressman (Jack Kemp?) in 1996 to win election in her own right. I wish that Archer had left ""Shall we tell the President"" alone and written a completely different book as the third installment."
4,Shall We Tell The President,I thought the author did an excellent job in weaving the plot into an exciting and interesting story. The only criticism I had about the story was we never learned who the Chairman was.
5,Outstanding Novel,Well written and exciting page turner by Jeffrey Turner. Puts you up close an personal as it navigates the Washington political scene.
5,Great book!,"""Shall we tell the president"" is a very good book! Once I started reading I couldn't put it away! Jeffrey Archer is a very good writer."
3,New author for me,I enjoyed this book but I have not been able to finish reading it. I kept loosing my place on my Kindle.
4,Jeff Archer's talent shines!,One of my favorite books for 2012! I am an avid fan and look forward to a new novel by one of my favorite authors! Read the entire book in less than 24 hours!
3,Tweaked,This tweaking of a storyline just so it would bump sales of this book seems like a rip off. Having said that I have enjoyed rereading this and the other two books in the series.
3,Very disappointing for a Jeffrey Archer novel,"As a Jeffery Archer fan, I was disappointed in ""Should We Tell the President?"" The characters were not that well developed and their relationships seemed contrived especially when compared to other Archer works."
3,Not as good as...,"""The day of the jackall"". Forsyth's story about a plot to kill De Gaulle is much more frightening. Archers' book is OK, but not on the same level. ""Shall we tell the President"" is perfect on alonghaul flight, or a long winternight."
5,What Goes On in The Senate and The FBI,"While Jeffrey Archer's previous 2 books, ""Kane & Abel,"" and ""The Prodigal Daughter,"" are are romance, politics, business, and a blend of history, with creativity, ""Shall We Tell the President,"" is a blend of politics and law enforcement on a level that most of us probably haven't considered is possible.I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, because Mr. Archer, being a master at his craft, created so many word pictures that you become part of the story.Watching Senate hearings, as a result of reading this book, I have more questions in mind.There are many surprizes, especially in the last 50 pages. And there are some speeches in this story that provide the readers with a great deal to think about, in terms of homeland security.It's a fast read -- not too heavy, yet this book will stretch your mind, as a good book should."
3,Not a review but a question I hope someone can answer,"Jeffrey Archer published this title in the late 1970's, and it concerned a plot to kill then-President Ted Kennedy. Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis quit her job at Viking over publication of this book. How is this 2008 version different from the original? It appears as if Archer has re-written the book, using the same title, with different characters. Can anyone opine on whether this is the case?"
5,"Fantastic, Fabulous, Fascinating!","This is certainly a must-read! I have yet to award any books that I have reviewed with 5 stars and this is certainly the first and most deserving one!The President is about to be assassinated and the FBI has 6 days to track the culprit. Archer uses twists and turns in his writing and together with love and lust, bringing the story to a thought-provoking culmination giving the story more thrill and meaning.Appreciate this authentic mystery story, read ""Shall we Tell the President""! I assure you a sweaty time reading at the edge of your chairs!"
4,Insightful,I found the book to be exciting and suspenseful. The author does a good job keeping the reader's interest throughout the book. It has been a while since I have read this author but I really enjoyed this book and will read more of Archer.
3,Predictable,"Predictable. Nothing earth shattering. Bland character development. I'm usually reading Scandanavian murder mysteries now and I'm spoiled, this was just a mystery, versus having the depth that I'm finding in the Norweigian, Swedish and Icelandic mysteries that I've found."
4,A SOLID THRILLER...,"This is an updated version of one of the author's earlier novels. First published in the nineteen seventies, the book caused some of controversy in its time, because the premise of the book revolved around an assasination plot against a newly sworn in President Edward Kennedy. In this updated version, the newly sworn in president is a woman, Florentyna Kane.When FBI Agent Mark Andrews finds himself to be the last man standing, he suddenly is made the point man for a very real plot to assassinate the president in less than a week's time. The problem is that the trail leads to Capitol Hill. Can Agent Brown discover who the mastermind is in time to thwart the plot?The author weaves a suspenseful, interesting story that will hold the attention of the reader. There are enough twists and turns to keep the reader engaged. Those who like cloak and dagger thrillers will most definitely enjoy this book."
2,If you could only get started,"When I first looked at this book, I thought `Finally, a knitting books that I can actually understand and love.' WRONG!!! Even though this how to do resource had information about materials, techniques, easy patterns; I couldn't get through the first step. There are tips on how to start your own teen knitting club even though I'm not sure how many New York City teens are eager to actually have one. There are patterns on make sweaters, hats, handbags and scarves. It looks like a very attractive book. Unlike other knitting books that use confusing abbreviations, the directions are clearly written out. Either I'm an idiot or this book makes knitting look easier than it really is."
2,"Not for ""Everyone""","I was a little disappointed in this book because of the limitations in sizing. Although it is well presented, some of the projects are elementary enough that you can figure them out for yourself. But the two girls I was going to get the book for, one is an XS and the other is XL, there wasn't much in the book for either of them. And not a lot of direction on how to alter a pattern. ""Teen Knitting Club"" implies that is for ages 13-19 and there are quite a range of sizes in those years."
2,Disappointing Lack of Challenge,"Being a teenage knitter, I was given this book as a gift and was very disappointed. I have been knitting for several years and the projects in this book were entirely too juvenile. I concede that they may be more appealing to someone who is just starting to knit, and that the authors have made a sincere effort to create projects that are creative and eye-catching. Unfortunately, this book seems to be written under the impression that teenage knitters are also not good knitters, and that challenging them would be unwelcome."
2,not even a year old,"I bought this hairdryer for my wife in March. It is now December and the heating element stopped working, so it now only blows cold air. It did a decent job when it worked but I am very disappointed that the product lasted less than a year."
2,Not a durable product,Bought this hairdryer almost exactly a year ago. Have loved it in every way until yesterday when it lost all heat.
4,Quality Dryer,"This Remington D-2009 T-Studio dryer may be the best value on the market for this type of dryer.Pros: Low-pitched, quiet motor, not too heavy, variety of heat and speed settings, very well made, dries with relatively low heat.Cons: High setting so powerful I couldn't use it to style my hair, and although my hair was very straight and sleek using this dryer, I felt it dried out the ends.Neutral: I prefer a wider barrel opening; this one is quite narrow.If you want a powerful, quiet, well-made dryer, this is it.If you want a gentler dryer, this isn't it."
1,Returning this,"I ordered this dryer specifically for the diffuser shown in the picture. Instead of the diffuser, it came with a cheap hair brush that you could purchase at a dollar store. :/"
3,Fine....if you're not expecting the same quality as a REAL tourmaline.,"I bought a T3 tourmaline dryer a while ago from Amazon and quickly found out that the seller (folica.com) is not an authorized dealer for T3 dryers and do not come with a manufacturers warranty. I returned the dryer thinking I could find something else down the road, and I saw this one for much less. I thought that since it had ""tourmaline"" in it, it would work pretty much the same as the T3. Needless to say, it didn't work any better than my old ceramic con air. So, if you're expecting this dryer to perform like a tourmaline/ceramic/ionic hair dryer, think again. Good for the money, but not spectacular."
1,FIRE CAUTION!!!!!,"I purchased this exact blow dryer a little over a year ago from a local retailer where I live and at first I love it!...It wasn't as heavy as most hair dryers I've had in the past and loved the attachments it came with...I have somewhat frizzy dry hair but after applying my styling products, this dryer was amzing the way it smoothed my hair and in half the time that my previous blow dryers took!...Until yesterday when I was in the middle of normal routine blow drying, the dryer started making popping sounds and immediately then started sparking on the base of the dryer where the cord connects to the dryer itself! There were small flames and smoke coming out of it which I immediately shut the dryer off but a couple of the sparks hit my arm which BURNED as well as my shirt!!! QUITE SCARY to say the least. I plunged the dryer under water after unplugging the unit and letting it cool down for a period of time! I will NEVER buy another Remington product EVER AGAIN!!!...BE WARNED!!!"
2,melting disaster....,"This product is not good. The concentrating attachment that I use to blow out my hair is melting on the inside causing it not to stay on. The attachment keeps blowing away. It is very annoying and I didn't even have it for a year. Besides that, it still didn't do a good job in blowing my hair out smoothly from the beginning. I should have returned it. My next hair dryer purchase will not be ""made in china,"" perhaps I will not have the melting problem."
5,Unbelievable Low Price,It's only about the half price of Big 5 with free shipping. It works great and lasts longer than 12 hours.
5,FUN FUN FUN,My son received this a a chritmas gift. He's nine monthS old. It is his favorite toy. When his cousins come over he doesn't want anyone else to ride. While I'm cleaning the house he will ride over and over again. He can turn it on/off by himself and he loves to push the button to turn the music on....hearing the music is a must. GREAT TOY......
5,Video of train in motion,"Length:: 0:58 MinsSee this fun train in use! This is the best ride-on train on the market. It is durable and fun! We thought the Perego train was junk. With this Step 2 train, you strap your little one in and away they go, weeee! An older child (2 or 3) can work the button by himself. This is my favorite toy. The video shows a horse toy first for a few seconds."
4,"Fun, easy to put together, and not as complicated as people are making it out to be","Ok, I read some of these reviews that were negative, and I can't find one bad thing to say about this roller coaster...my son has been riding on it since he was about 8 months old. He loves it! A little girl who is 2 comes over who is REALLY energetic, and she would ride this thing all day...I think the motion soothes her. Anyway, I had no problems with the directions (and I HATE reading directions). Didn't need to call customer service, so I have no comment."
4,Nice Toy,"My husband & I were so excited to give this to our 11 month old daughter for her 1st Christmas. We hid it from her & showed it to her last (after she opened all her presents). To our dismay, she screamed while on it and didn't want anything to do with it. Later in the day when family came to the house and everyone cheered for her, she rode it more but wasn't sure about it. Now 6 months later, it still isn't her favorite toy. She will barely ride it, but loves the music. Other kids that come over, however, love it. Right now I have it put up and will get it out again in a month or so and try it again. The tracks don't lock together and it does take up a lot of room. I just wish she liked it better because I think its great! We had no trouble putting it together and I take it apart fairly often to vacuum."
5,My daughter LOVES this toy....,My mom actually bought this for my daughter when she was only 6 months old and she loved it!!!! She rides it all the time and every kid that comes to the house LOVES it too!She is 2 now and still rides it just as much. I would HIGHLY recommend buying this....My daughter rode it so much that at 10 months old she could get in it and turn it on herself.We had to bring it home on a trailer cause she lives afew hours away and on the way the box ripped open from the wind - it went everywhere but we stopped and picked it up and it was totally fine barely any scraches at all. THIS TOY IS GREAT!!!!!!
2,My daughter is terrified of it,"I bought this for my then one year old. She is tall and into everything, no fears whatsoever, so I thought great toy. In my opinion, it just goes too fast for smaller kids. She would scream hysterically and want off. Even today, she's 2 now and will ride rides at amusement parks, chucky cheese, but is still scared to death of the coaster. I also think part of it is because it's very loud when it runs. I'm not talking about the music, the coaster itself is loud and then it runs fast. On the other hand, it's very durable. I myself took a couple of spins around on it and it did great. Very fast to put together or take apart."
2,Very disappointed. What a dull toy,"You need to push a button near the bar in front in order to play the music. Keep in mind you must push it while the ride is going. Quite annoying. My 10 month old is just bored by it. From the start, he would just stare at me as it went in a circle and yawn. It was so ""thrilling"" that he fell asleep on it twice. Other children in the neighborhood (from 7 months to 2 years) have ridden it and also not liked it at all. To be blunt, I could not even give it away. For people interested in buying it, I would suggest waiting and getting the Perego train."
1,Step1 Music in Motion Roller Coaster,We purchased this for our daughter for XMAS. Opened it up to set it up and the track doesn't fit together. Called Step2 and they acted like I was nuts saything that the track wasn't fitting together. They have made me take pictures of it and send them to them. Still haven't heard what they plan on doing about the track. If I don't hear from them by tomorrow then I will take it back to the store. I don't want to miss my window of opportunity to return it after Xmas. Very unimpressed with their customer service department. Would think twice about purchasing another Step2 Product. Would it really have been a big deal for them to just send me another track? Don't think so!!!!
1,Dangerouse!!!!!!!!!!!,"He got it for his birthday and after 2 weeks the music stoped working!not much fun without it..step 2 sent a new music box replacment free of charge 2 weeks later so that was fixed.My son is 15 months old and weighs 25lb. the rollercoaster has tipped over twice and hurt him bad enough,mind u he was just sitting there being a good boy with his hands on the bar (if they wern't on the bar he could easilly brake an arm)he's had this thing for only 3 months!Oh yeah after the thing tips over with your kid in it it keeps going and trying to spin don't forget he's also strapped in the thing screamming SCARRY! the battery compartment is were the music is all you hafto do is lift (its velcroed down)it up to expose all the wireing were your little one will insist on openning and risk a shoking if he gets his hands in."
1,Unsafe Toy,"My son has tipped over on this toy several times. The last time he got a bump and bruise on his head. Step 2 the manufacturer would not exchange this product for me, Sharon Werstler, customer service manager told me to put pillows around it, which I thought was absurd. I would not only not purchase this product I wouldnt buy any of there products since they are not concerned about the safety of our children."
5,Wonderful Toy!,"My daughter got this for Christmas from her Aunt! (My sister loves to spoil her nieces!) It is a great toy! If your child won't sit down in it, of course they will tip over. My daughter has no problem with sitting since she's having such a great time! It's an awesome toy & worth every penny!!!"
5,Great Read!,"This is one of the best books I have read, it ventures into areas previously overlooked or ignored. A wonderful book!"
1,Slanted NonHistory,This is the very worst in historical writing by someone who is not an historian. Irving makes no secret of his admiration of the Nazis and his charge that W.C. was a pawn in an international Zionist conspiracy will say volumes to any intelligent reader about the author's mindset. This book is strictly for those who read in jackboots and polished coal-scuttle.
2,Interesting View,"Irving is as biased as most writers (he's hardly an ""esteemed historian) and he specializes in Nazi apologetics. This book is interesting, if only as an example of Irving's curious personal views. He has dined on his own cooked-up controversy so long, twisting the truth comes naturally. There is always an audience for these ""theories"" and Irving plays to it like a virtuoso."
5,DEVASTATING!!!...TRULY,"I am French, and I read David Irving's book with a sens of great relief...at long last, historians like DI starts to appear on the scene to tell us the truth about WWII and what really happenned. Even so, one can still imagine what has not been said. Although the 50 years period has since long gone by, the British archives are still not willing to release the documents about that time still in their possession. One wonders why !!."
1,Incredible,"As a curiosity, this book deserves a 2. As for scholarship, accuracy, and depth, 0. At times it reads like it was issued by the Nazi propaganda office in 1940. Should more than satisfy the squarehead crowd who believe Hitler was misunderstood and the death camps never existed."
1,Nonsense,This certainly isn't history as Irving's writing reeks of propaganda. His well deserved reputation precedes him and is proven true with this book.
2,A Flawed Historian,"I used to be a convinced Irving reader. Convinced that is that he represented an alternative view of history. This book is the one where he really departed from reality.All of Churchill's faults, alcoholism, cronyism, poor financial judgement, are high-lighted. The fact that he saved civilisation as we know it is ignored.The early Nazi leaders biographies and Hitlers War were interesting. I never even picked up on the holocaust denial views in there at the time.One is judged by the company one keeps......inspect the ranks of Irvings defenders nowadays.....This is not rational objective history."
2,Interesting Curio,"Irving is a discredited ""historian"" of dubious credentials and poor reputation, but this book is fascinating in the creative manipulation of supposed new information. In that, Irving is at the top of his game. Sadly, one simply can't believe what he writes."
5,Superbly written and documented. Fascinating reading.,"Irvings original research and writing style combine to make Churchill's War a most enjoyable and thought-provoking read that I found to be intensely humerous and ironic at times. Irving practically chain-linked the words of Joe Kennedy, FDR, Herbert Hoover, Churchill, and a host of others to build paragraph after paragraph of free flowing, engrossing and controversial text. This was the first of Irving's work that I have read but certainly not my last. After reading some criticisms of this book I question whether the same book is being discussed and/or there is some animosity toward this author that is not related to the quality of his work."
4,Eeyore will play for hours (and hours and hours ...),"My 11-month-old loves Eeyore. She grabs him by the tail and crawls around with him and swings him around. She has the Baby Pooh version of this toy, too. She plays with him (his music is much less annoying), but he can't beat Eeyore's tail. The button on Eeyore that is suppose to trigger the music has broke, but a good swing against the floor, and he plays anyway. When he turns his head, he sounds like a visit to the chiropractor is needed, but it still works. His voice is a little creepy. One thing I really, really wish they would have included -- volume adjustment."
3,cute toy but not eeyore's voice,"Having many eeyore toys myself growing up, i always like to buy them for my 8 month old daughter too. This one doesn't really rate that high for me. Whoever supplied the voice is not the same person whose done it for every other animated feature and toy. It sounds a little like Vincent Price to me. A little creepy actually. The mechanism that move the head is a little loud also. But i'm sure that matters not to any baby learning to crawl."
5,My niece loved it!,We had previously given our niece pooh and tigger and thought this would be an excellent addition. She loves eeyore just as much as the other two now.
3,Eeyore is awsome!!!,I just bought this for my daughter last week and she loves it. She especially likes the bow on eeyore's tail. it actually does give her incentive to crawl. you push the button near eeyore's back and he says a cute phrase which catches my daughters eye.the only complaint i have about this product is it is LOUD!!! i guess it may be loud for when it is far away trying to get the child to crawl towards it. but all that matters is my daughter loves this toy.
3,In the bottom of the toy box,"We were just not impressed at all with this toy. We were trying to motivate our son to crawl. I think this scared him away more than it encouraged him to follow. It was a bit difficult to start and did not move on the carpet. It wasn't helpful to try to get our son to crawl on the ceramic tile. Oh well, he is walking now, so all is fine anyway."
2,Poor Quality- Light Brass,"It will have to do, until I find out where the made in the USA 3/4 hose bibs. Cheap 'spare'. Brass is so light it feels like spun aluminum. Made in China."
2,No Streets Of Rage but better than that Batman Forever on SNES & Genesis,I'll admit that this game isn't great it ain't as bad as the Batman Forever games on the 16 bit systems at least I can go across the screen & kick peoples a$$es I don't have to enter a weird button combination to use weapons. I mean there are better beat em ups out there this is an ok game it doesn't follow the movie that well the ending was kind of lame. Basically the story is about Riddler & his boxes that read peoples minds & Two Face killing Dick Graysons parents. The game is 2 players you can play as Batman & Robin it's ok but for a better beat em up with Batman play Batman Returns on SNES.
2,Simply Disappointed,"It is true that this camera has a lot of features, but you would expect that the more advanced products would perform better than the old ones. I own a PC-CAM 750 that I enjoyed using a lot. When the 880 came out I bought it on July 2nd 2003. I didn't use it until I went on vacation in August, what a mistake I made. I should have tried it sooner, so I can return it quickly. As a web cam, it requires a lot of light coming from behind it, and it doesn't like fluorescent light. Taking videos indoors requires a lot of light too. I am making these comments in comparison with how the PC-CAM 750 performs, the 880 is a step down in quality in my opinion."
2,not as clear Pictures as my pc-cam600,"Well i just got the pc-cam880 and it should be better then the 600 but that's not so, the picture's i took with this cam notas good and clear as the pc-cam600 so i'm thinking about returning this pc-cam880."
2,not as clear Pictures as my pc-cam600,Well i just got the pc-cam880 and it should be better then the 600 but that's not so the picture's i took with this cam is just not as good and clear as the pc-cam600 so i'm thinking about returning this pc-cam880.
1,not worth the time and the money,"Attracted by the title, I thought it could be a could follow up to ""the secret"". As a matter of fact it's just a poor and pale copy of it. It just seems the producers wanted to ""surf the wave"" ""the secret"" created. It's just a riddle on a pond. All the contributors are from the same walk of life, all are consultants or coaches, no new idea, the illustration stories don't match with the subject and seem to come out of the blue. It's all the same old things that our teachers have been taught : work hard, very hard and believe in it. No hard work, no pain, no gain. That's it. A very christian thing ! If you liked ""the secret"" don't waste your time with ""the answer"" because it won't give you any ... answer !"
5,Powerful and Lifechanging,Dutch Sheets is a wonderful author and teacher. He easily conveys God's truths in everyday language and plenty of life stories to illustrate his points. This should be a must-read for every Christian.
5,Effectively Powerful Information,"Currently I'm on chapter five and already my spirit is learning and confirming God's listening ear from Prayer. This book teaches biblical principles with confirming testimonies. As a author myself I appreciate sharing God's word through books, forever grateful. Shari Pettiford, Author of The Altar book & Play and Quiet Time."
5,Splendid- absolutely breathtaking,"Mary Sears did a stunning job writing this quaint charmer about window boxes. A lover of window boxes myself for many years, I found this book both helpful and inspiring. Truly worth every cent."
3,A few good ideas.,"The book is somewhat dated.Still, there are some good ideas, and ideas for different seasons, which is a nice addition."
1,Boring!,I've read every book on the topic and this is by far the most elementary. You don't need a degree in marketing to see the author has no experience or insight on this delicate market.
2,Marketing 101,"I had great hopes for the new insights I'd get from this book, but it was like the author hadn't been to Marketing 101 and thought she'd figured out the virtues of direct marketing all by herself. Some interesting case histories and anecdotes, but was it worth the cover price?"
4,"No ice in the bucket, so that's good","It seems to work as expected. No ice in the bucket so that seems to be the point. I have had 3 other ""electric dog bowls"", two of which have stopped working. Only time will tell if this one is any better, but I am very happy so far."
1,Wasted my money on this one,I bought two of these for my dogs. They have only been used about 6 weeks and they do not work well. The buckets are not outdoors but in an insulated garage type building. Water freezes on the top and the cords get stiff and rigid in the cold weather. They are not easy to wash because the cord hangs out the bottom side and gets in the way if you want to wash the buckets in a sink. The flat sided bucket would be best if you need to place the bucket against a wall or fencing but I cannot recommend this item and would not purchase again myself. One of the dogs also chewed on the top edge of one of the buckets and the dog is not a chewer. The plastic is fairly soft so tempting to chew on I guess.
1,Great....if you live in Miami or LA,"I live in a cold climate where it routinely gets below 10 degrees at night. I have this bucket next to a windowed door on my patio, so I know some heat leaks from the house to it at night, and it still freezes over the top when weather gets below about 20 degrees. The bucket is working because I can feel that the bottom is warm--water still freezes over. Makes it easier to break ice in the morning, but pretty much worthless if you need to leave for a day or two and want your dog to have something to drink other than a popsickle."
4,Well Crafted/We need more!,"I own two of this and and another and although I am happy to have them, I really was unhappy that they were ""chopped"". Also, Of all of the full episodes I think there was just one that I didn't absolutely love, so why not offer the FULL episodes as a set? I would surely buy it...the DVD quality is really good, I just wish the episodes were complete!"
5,good but to short,I enjoyed this DVD and hope that more are released.The only downside is it only has a running time of 66 mins.
3,SO_SO,It was good for that type of design. Shabby chic is on it's way out of style. I would not reccommend it if you plan on selling your house.
2,Clever stories but no handbook,The book benefits from amusing anecdotes but is very light on actual help for putting in place a workable framework for managing business innovation.
4,I'd highly recommend this book!,"As a martial artist and consultant, I found this book to be very helpful in conceptualizing the connection between martial arts and leadership. I would recommend it to anyone seeking to become a better leader."
5,Perfect !,"I love these things!I have weak wrists and needed a glove that standup to lifting weights, bike riding and other activities (that it really was not designed for, I get that). Normally I wear through biking gloves like mad and can almost never get ones that protect my wrists. These do all that, are comfortable, stand up to (well) me.The only complaint is that the finger lengths are a 1/4 inch too short, especially on the thumbs. I even got the x-large to see if that would help (it did not). After they get a bit worn in, the fabric on the fingers loosens and they shring loosing at 1/4 inch and exposing my fingers to a bit more wear and tear than I would like.But still, even with that - the best."
1,Not informative,"While these authors have examined themes related to Schwarzenegger, potential readers should be aware that this book touches on themes, but is not a detailed or scholarly work. For example, one chapter consists of the authors' dreams about Schwarzenegger over the years."
1,Just a long list of Arnold appearing in our culture,"""Why Arnold Matters"" is a poor title. I bought the book based on the title, hoping to learn why Arnold matters. A better title would be ""A long list of where Arnold shows up all over our culture and how really, really popular he is."" I'm fascinated by Arnold, but frankly this is not interesting reading."
1,Why this book DOESN'T matter.....,"Circular arguments. ""Because we say so"". The same thing repeated over and over and over and over and over and over and . . . . .Nowhere in this book do the authors address any solid reasons for Ah-nuld's popularity. They're out there, it's just that the authors posit reasons and then dance around justifying their opinions using - are you ready for this? - their opinions.In the first 50 pages I must've read the same thing 50 times, just stated slightly differently each time. You made your point in the first paragraph, please please puh-leeze move on to something else!Don't bother. Don't even bother borrowing it from the library."
3,Rainbow star Bulletin Board Set,"The item was received before two weeks, which was great!! However, it was too large for the area that I had planned on using it. It is very bright and colorful."
1,"The worst that money can buy: beyond primitive, naive and boring","I bought this book because of the good reviews. It is a huge disappointment. Baseless, primitive fantasy about Utopian world, marketed as a practical strategy, yet, devoid of any practical proposal. I have not learned anything that I did know about: that some day we would have urban air transportation (there goes fuel economy and green design), underwater cities (is Mr. Fresco himself going to be the first resident?), democracy without corruption (and how is it going to be achieved?). Do not waste your money. You can get the same information by googling around for free."
4,Times and Trail has changed,"Earl brings you back to when The Trail was at its beginnings and took a very different route than it does now. The reader joins him on his ""walk with spring"" through towns and bushwacking. It is an amazing account of what the trail was like before it became the AT! If you are looking for a reference...this is NOT your book...but if you want to know the real AT beginnings...definitely pick it up!"
3,worked ok,"It works OK, and it is nice to watch TV on your computer, especially in small living spaces.It does run REALLY hot though, as another reviewer mentioned. Be careful it does not get too hot, and damage computer components."
2,unremarkable,"This guide offers a concise overview of the cultivated trees (mostly fruit trees) of SE Asia. The narrow size of the book suggests that it was designed for the glove compartment of a car. I can well imagine it may come in handy as a first check. The distribution maps are a nice feature.Nevertheless, in such a guide I would really expect more in the way of illustrations. The plates are dominated by tree silhouettes (often in black) and the watercolor pictures of flowers and fruits don't get as much room as would be desirable: often they are printed rather smallish.In this day and age of glorious color photography this 1995 guide looks rather modest, certainly at this price."
4,"New Zealand, Here We Come!","With Rhys Darby and Sally Hawkins in a somewhat subdued romantic comedy/dramady taking place in Middle Earth, how can one lose?Rhys Darby loses his love- she walks out, a wounded duck crashes in. He seeks help from a reluctant Sally Hawkins. Will love bloom and conquer all? Of course, enjoy the ride and the obligatory bumps in the romance and happy ending- well, perhaps, happy. Stay tuned.We loved Sally Hawkins in Happy-Go-Lucky and, even more so, in the zany, romantic comedy, Happy Ever Afters. Here, she is much more reserved and cautious, but still charming, funny and vulnerable. Just don't expect the intensity of those other flicks. This is a gentler story with some silly duck antics filmed in a beautiful country with Queen music to pick it up now and then.Nice change of pace."
3,Review snoopy IT tie,"This is a very nice tie, humorous and elegant at the same time, made by a really very good silk fabric. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is that as a collector I think that 4 & 5 stars should be given to exceptional ties like Leonard & Fornasetti.Thanks Amazon for providing this product!"
2,Half a life,"This book is a mildly interesting account of a self-absorbed environmentalist. His descripitions of the canyonlands are sometimes exquisite, I wish he would have stuck to nature."
4,Brought back memories!,I really enjoyed the movie. I hadn't see the movie since I was kid! This is going to become another family favorite.
4,Adventurous ground for the pedal steel guitar,"California composer Sasha Matson is a modernist with a sweet spot for harmonious timbres. As a steel guitarist, I was most interested in ""Steel Chords"". Incorporating a pedal steel into a small chamber orchestra playing modern music is an interesting premise, and Matson proceeds cautiously. The pedal steel part is rather tame, suggesting that Matson doesn't fully understand the potential of the instrument.Steel guitarist Doug Livingston performs the part flawlessly, and the entire ensemble embraces Matson's score lovingly, though. This is fine listening for a late afternoon, and it relaxes the senses in spite of the dissonance we have come to expect from modern music.My only complaint is that the steel guitar could have been louder in the mix. ""Steel Chords"" is the only modern classical piece I know of that features the pedal steel. It's a pity that we can't always tell what the instrument is doing.-Bob Lee"
1,pilgrim's progress,I purchased this book for my husband as a Christmasgift. He was in the process of reading it and found that pages144-177 were missing. The book is useless to us.
5,Antiphone Blues: Music of Ellington,"An audiophile recording. I don't like most of the recordings in terms of content, but it's very useful to test your audio set-up."
4,My daughter loves it!,"My 4 year old daughter loves this stroller. It was a little pricey for the quality, though. Before she even used it, one of the wheels was broken. I hope if you order this, you have enough lead time to order a replacement wheel from the manufacturer (which they will gladly supply--in about 5 more days).The only other thing to note is that this stroller will require some additional sewing on of velcro to make the carrier strong enough."
2,Nice looking quality is so so,My daughter loved the carriage but two wheels were broken on day one. The toy store owner offered to replace them but it's hard to explain that to a two year old who wants to wheel her babies.
4,Big hit with granddaughter,"I bought this for my 21 month old granddaughter for Christmas and she absolutely loves it. It was very easy to put together, very cute and easy for her to manouver and push. She can't operate the bonnet yet and she doesn't know how to take the bed part out to use as a carrier, but that's just as well. She's pretty rough with it, piles it high with all her dolls at once, and it appears to be holding up."
2,NOT a genuine Kirby part,The item I received was not a genuine kirby part but with a little bit of work I made it fit in my Kirby.
3,Cheap replacement showerhead but it's noisy,"This showerhead is cheap yet it outperforms the original unit in my apartment which was just pitiful. For the price it performs OK producing a fairly satisfying stream but it also is pretty noisy. I don't use the ""massage"" setting but whatever mechanism they have in there must be responsible for the noise even when set to the normal mode. I'll probably replace it with something else if I ever find myself in a hardware or home improvement store but for now it does the job."
5,A great start for a Yoga home practice,"This was the first book and CD I purchased when I became interested in yoga a couple of years ago. At the time I had little access to yoga classes and wasn't sure where to start. I encountered this little gem and have since established a steady home practice; I count this beginner set as a turning point for me. The really terrific thing about this book and CD is the gentle pace at which Tara Frazer moves you through the elemental postures. Her focus on ujayii breathing helps the beginner to learn not only the postures in their proper form, but also the necessary breath work - most important in helping the concentration and ultimately in helping the meditation in motion that is yoga. Anybody who wants to get started on a yoga practice, forget the videos (after all, who can do yoga and watch a video at the same time?) and get this set."
1,TOTALLY NOT WHAT THE TITLE SAYS!,"The DVD itself is talking about vintage clothing, not romance or gifts or sentiments. I had to return it twice, thus no review really."
5,Excellent !,I got this CD when I was fourtheen and felt in love with it. I am now twenty five and I am still sleeping with it !
5,Another good album,"Another good album by Gilbert. I bought ""Himself"" some weeks ago and now I've bought Back to Front. I note ""I'm a writer"" will be released soon and I will also buy it. Can't wait for ""Stranger in my own backyard' to be released."
5,Excellent vanilla tea,"Twinings tea is almost always better than what can be found elsewhere, and this vanilla tea is no exception. Smooth, rich, and with the perfect touch of vanilla, its full-bodied flavour is elegant and creates a wonderful aroma."
5,Another Great Book!!,"I have been a fan of James Mason since 1954 after seeing ""A Star is Born."" In the past four or five years I have wanted to see as many of his movies as I can which Turner Classic Movies has helped a lot on this need.Of course, I did not know he had written a book so I had to have that. Then a book showed up ofsome of his movies, except the last ten years of his life. Then this book, James Mason, Odd ManOut. After I ordered it, I was naturally impatient to hold it in my hands and it arrived sooner than anticipated. I read it in two days, loved it, learned a lot about the man I did not know before. It was very sad to find out he had such a miserable life, but fortunately, he met hissecond wife and I understand this made up for all his life before then. If you are a fan of James Mason, this is a must read, then you have to read ""James Mason: A Personal Biography byDiana De Rosso. It also was great."
5,We had Good Music Thwn,"I bought this to replace the sounds on my missing 33rpm collection. This small part is as great as the original recordings and, of course, much more convenient in contemporary format. Desmond is always great."
3,Flawed gem,"Another brilliant performance by Paul Desmond, enhanced by Ed Bickert's guitar and the rest of the combo, however spoiled by audience chatter. I suppose one must contend with the sad fact that a large proportion of the population does not comprise music enthusiasts, however you would think they would have the decency to shut up during performances. These monkeys had probably had a bit to drink too. There are numerous live performances which are marred like this, yet you can get some in which the audience appreciates the talent before them. Due to the venue, the sound seems to lack clarity too. Still, it was worth the price."
4,Replace Take Five with a better take!,"When I first heard this live on double LPs in the early 90s, I thought Desmond's playing was feeble. His usual ""slow"" playing didn't sound ""smooth"" or ""polished"" but ""tired"" and ""vanishing."" This was understandable, given the fact that he was suffering not only from creeping old age but also from lung cancer, as we know now. But this CD reissue has given me a completely different impression. He sounds great with a lot more energy that I failed to catch in the LPs.But what on earth happened to Take Five? Vulnerable Desmond is back. His sax sounds ""off microphone"" as compared to other tunes whose Paul's solos are captured much more clearly ""on microphone."" Since five evenings worth of their performances were recorded, much better take of Take Five should have been included in the LPs and this CD. OR, I welcome the box set issue of ""The Complete Bourbon Street Sessions,"" as we have seen with a number of Bill Evans Trio club sessions."
5,Agood investment,As far as pneumatic oils go I cannot see a difference between brands. This same stuff can be purchased at the HD for the same cost or less than it is here. While I cannot recommend any one brand over another I will recommend that you oil your air tools as the alternative is costly repairs.
3,"High quality earphone, microphone is anemic","Sounds come through great on this headset, but on both of two phones I tried the microphone's output volume was very weak (people would ALWAYS ask you to speak up, even with the microphone right in front of your lips). Perhaps I got a bad unit, but this ones going back to the store. I wish it had worked out!"
3,"OK, except for mute","This headset is comfortable and has good sound quality.The only thing I do not like about it is that the mute button has to be held down to work. I prefer one that is more like a switch. That way I can listen to a conference call or do some task with my hands free while on the phone. I have had to use a large paperclip to try and hold the button down and this is quite inconvenient.If you don't need a mute button and you like this style of headset, it is better than the others I have tried."
4,Smart Managing for Smart Managers,"Managing Smart is a book for new and experienced managers alike. It is well organized, has an excellent index, and a comprehensive list of references. It can be read from beginning to end, or can be picked up and used as a quick reference. I found the sections on time management and quality management especially helpful. And, although no one enjoys disciplining an employee, tip #159 offers some positive principles and behavioral approaches. I would recommend this book to anyone in a management position, be it in a large firm or small, from health care to manufacturing."
5,Why did I spend two years at business school?,"A simple clear and insightful book that goes to the heart of the critical information taught in business school and the academy of life. I have benefitted from hundreds of the clear messages put forth by the authors. While I have put it down, it is not forgotten as the business fundamentals discussed make this a daily resource in the management battlefield. I highly commend the team and look forward to their next publication. Hooray!"
5,Forget Drucker and Deming,"Forget Drucker and Deming. Drs. Milgram and Spector along with Mr. Treger have provided a succinct summary of most of the important issues that managers at all levels deal with in both day to day operations and stategic thinking. The book is easy to understand and should be required reading for all entry level managers and professional athletes. If John Rocker could read and had read this book before he talked with Sports Illustrated, he would be a guest on Letterman and Nightline rather than the object of public scorn and ridicule. For the security of the future of America, Jesse Ventura should not read this book as it has the potential to make him extremely dangerous."
3,Nice Compilation,"Putumayo releases some enjoyable compliation albums, Caribbean Playground included. However, not all the tracks on this collection are strong. This album is worth adding to your collection---but it not one that you'll continue playing over and over again."
5,Love this CD,"I got this for my daughter when she was about 6 months old. She's 2 years old now and still loving it. We dance to it all the time. It's not the typical kiddie music which I love. It even has a version of ""Three Little Birds"" by Bob Marley. Simply love it."
5,Legend of the Smokies...,"I bought this book as I had read Molloy's ""Trial by Trail"" book about his adventures in the GSMNP. I knew that by living in this part of East Tennessee for 20 years, if anyone would know a good overnighter to do in the GSMNP, it would be Johnny Molloy. With over 900 miles of trails in this national park, his knowledge of the Smokies environment, writing style, and accuracy has, once again, impressed me. You can tell that the writer himself has a love and appreciation for these mountains. As a reader and a resident in the Smokies foothills, I can't tell you how I appreciate that! I have a collection of outdoor guidebooks, and Molloy is becoming the major author on my bookshelf!"
1,not very informative,"This book was not helpful in planning the trip are looking for (2 night backcountry). There are others that are much, much better."
1,Ron B's review,"My sleep problem is that I fall asleep with no problem, but any wake-up event is almost always followed by hours of NO sleep. I've tried the usual; meditation, sleep-aids such as melatonin and the latest Sleep MD, and Dr. prescribed Valium to return to sleep mode.Sleep MD has had absolutely NO effect for my problem.Valium works but is followed by drowsiness and drugged effect after morning wake-up, and does not eliminate additional wake-ups.I would appreciate any advice for my sleep problem.I am 3 weeks shy of my 71st birthday."
1,sleep md,"I had a terrible reaction to this product. After about a week I experienced severe lethargy to the point I could not go to work or do anything. I stopped it and am back to normal.Sleep MD- Iovate Natural Sleep Formula, 40ct"
3,OK For Half Retail Price?,"The Sleep MD box appeared to be assembled by the distributor in bulk - not like you would see from a regular store.The lid flaps were obviously hot-melt-glued in place,no printed expiry date on the carton,no documentation pamphlet inside,and the expiry date printed on the sealed blister-packs was only 6 months away.OK for paying half the regular retail price?"
1,A bunch of herbs that don't work,I bought this because I have trouble getting to sleep and it doesn't work. I even got desperate enough to take 3 pills (don't try this! I only did it out of sheer lack of sleep craziness and the fact that I've go extra weight to handle the dosage). It still didn't make me go to sleep. I didn't want to risk taking to many because it contains Valerian which in high doses is deadly. What has really worked for me is the Maximum Strength Unisom softgels. I sleep straight through the night after taking one of those.
2,Awful for me.,"I would STRONGLY recommend NOT taking this product, it actually caused the opposite effect, near insomnia in my case. Take with caution."
4,good as a prescription,I have taken several prescription sleep products and the last one I tried was rozeram. It worked pretty well but cost around a $100 and I have no prescription coverage. Well I found sleep md and I have to say it worked just as good as rozeram and at a much lower price. I have been taking it for 2 years and it is a good alternative to pricey sleeping pills.
3,did not work for me but....,"as someone that has been dealing with insomnia for years, I can suggest that where SAFE and possible, try *everything*.Everyone is different and being that there are many positive reviews here, obviously SleepMD has helped some people to get the rest they need. I am adding my result to the mix so people can have a better idea of how many people feel helped or not by this product.While this product did not help me sleep I did not feel any negative side effects either like being groggy the next day or otherwise.Hope this works for you."
3,SleepAid,"I have been using this for about a month. It does not work for me, but this does not say it does not work for others. It does relax me prior to going to sleep, but it does not keep me a sleep as advertised.Again, for me it does not do a good job, but it may work with others."
1,The Nightmares!,"I did not like this product at all. It did not help me fall asleep any faster than usual. When I did fall asleep, I kept waking up every hour or so. Then I kept having nightmares, which are something I almost never get. I woke up feeling like my head was cloudy and had wild mood swings for the first part of my day."
2,"Helped, but be warned of serious side effects!","My husband and I both used this product for several weeks. It did help us fall asleep faster but not necessarily stay asleep, in fact seemed to interfere with normal sleep patterns. My main concern with the product is that I started experiencing sudden sadness, near depression-like symptoms, which is not like me at all. I reviewed the ingredients again and after researching online realized that the main active ingredient is Melatonin, which has been linked to depression (among other side effects) for some users. My husband did not experience this, but he does take a heart med, and Melatonin counteracts with heart medications! A lesson learned -- even if a product states that it's ""all natural"" you should consult your physician before taking it."
3,sleepmd,i got this iteam fast it does work well though i get an upset stomach from it so if u need help sleeping try it
1,SleepMD,"I had no luck with this at all. It actually had the opposite effect. I kept waking up and had wild dreams. After I woke up, I felt drugged until lunch time. I'm 66 and still looking for something natural that works."
2,"Only standard, not great.","Call me a jazz snob if you want to, but don't expect me to gush when gushing isn't warranted. This is decent, but not great. Solid, but not mind-blowing. What can I say? I feel like they are trying too hard to be straight-ahead and swinging, yet they don't really swing, but fill all the groovy spaces.Arbuckle plays non-stop. When Barron is laying down the vamps, its just too much. Nothing I haven't heard before elsewhere... so why bother, you know? A Bop wall of sound that has not enough finesse. And don't get me wrong, I wanted to love it. I am not one of those dudes who thinks that in order to sound good, I have to cut people down.Here's what I will say positive about this album though: I only paid a dollar for it used at the local buy-sell-trade store... so nothing lost really... I am gonna give it to someone who isn't as particular as I am."
2,Save your money,"Save your money. The entire contents of the study guide are already availible for free on the text book website. Chapter outlines, case summaries, chapter overviews, and practice tests are all there."
4,Easy read,"This book is a fast read. It is enjoyable, but superficially so. Max finally succumbs and kisses Elizabeth. However Sarah, the spoiled brat, hates Elizabeth for spying on her and conspires with that annoying twit Victoria, against Liz. Liz is forced to spy by the Lord. (She is only the scullery maid with no other home or connections.) I like James Leer and Vanessa. They interact finally and that was the best part of the novel. Max is torn between the traditional conflict: duty and desire. Max is getting annoying. Make up your mind already!! While his desire is whetted by the kiss, duty still overrides and he is still going to marry Lavinia, who is shown even more to be a big, big , witch. (please think of the other rhyming and alliterative word.) These books are like I said, easy and fast, and superficially enjoyable."
5,A Good Book,"Downstairs, Upstairs was interesting, and well written. I liked it a lot. It was worth buying, if you are a fan of Sweet Valley, but particularly of Elizabeth. I prefer the Elizabeth series to the SVH, and I liked this book. It has an interesting plot and is worth the money."
1,BUYER BEWARE!,"I don't know about this particular model, but I bought a similar model, one with the removable insert, and the glass door exploded. Please read my web page before purchasing this item, at www.selectsmart.com/explodingtoastmaster.html Other people have reported fires and the exploding glass door on several similar Toastmaster models with the removable insert."
4,Ignore the naysayers...,"Detailed and practical this book is filled with great information and exercises to get you thinking about the ways we invite and the ways to work out of the grasp of the varied vampires, Machiavellians, narcissists, sadists, or combination there of that might have infected YOUR LIFE.Chapters1-Overwhelmed, Enmeshed and Manipulated2-Emotional susceptibility and Seduction3-YOU ARE NOT ALWAYS RESPONSIBLY FOR OTHERS (I LIKE THIS ONE A LOT!)4-Let others have their feelings.

If you don't do them it won't effect your ability to get through the rest of the material either.Just what I needed to boost me out of the caregivers rut and narcissistic family.Read and get on with YOUR LIFE! ;-)"
1,Save your money,"I took the title of my review from someone else who wrote about this book.I expected intelligent essays and all this book has is a shopping list of ideas. The author does not explore any of her ideas.This book is a sorry excuse for a book; it is more like a brainstorming activity or a better phrase would be, it is merely like a shopping list.I read it twice and was afraid I was missing some gems. The fact is the book is missing any real content. It is a real joke that the publisher put this book in print.One of my favorite authors is Elaine Aron who wrote the Highly Sensitive Person. Elaine has more useful information on her web site than Ms. Brown has in this book. Save your money!!!!!"
4,A fun read,"Sam has had to deal with a lot of loss in her life. Her mom left her and her father when she was a baby, then her father disappears, she sends the love of her life away after a misunderstanding, and then her good friend disappears. She is coping the best she can, taking over the family business as hostess on a private island, leading dives, and giving vacationers a few weeks in paradise. So, when the love of her life, Adam, shows up again just in time to rescue her from a kidnapping attempt, she wants answers!I liked the book, it was a fun read. The romance was good (if a little volatile) and the book was definitely filled with mystery. The onlt problem I had was that there were just too many sub-plots going on at the same time. I had a hard time focusing on the main characters because I was so busy trying to figure out what everyone else had to do with the book. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in mystery/romance books and to anyone interested in diving."
2,Enough Already!!!,"I love a good story, and on the story line I would give this a five star rating! But I found myself skimming the page after page of sexual content to get back to that good story. A little sexual tension is good even a little sexual suggestion but not three four and five pages in a row of explicit sex."
1,Disjointed,"Too many characters and no continuity. She jumps from one set of characters to another without ever completing a thought. She is trying to create suspense, but half way through I found myself frustrated, wanting to read a ""normal"" conversation with some story line to it. Too many incomplete sentences. Too many subplots with no substance to help get a grip on the story."
2,A read in one sitting book.,"This slim memoir tells the story of Helga, a woman, who as a child was abandoned during WWII by her mother. Since her mother left her, her brother and their father to join the Nazi party, Helga has had questions she needs answered. After a brief meeting in the `70s, Helga is visiting her now ninety year old mother again, in order for some closure. The story goes back and forth from the present conversation with her mother to flashbacks from the war. The story is an emotional rollercoaster. It's the sort of book that needs to be read all in one sitting to get the full effect. Not the best piece of Holocaust literature I've read, but you still take something away with you."
1,control springs,Before you purchase these springs check the measurments. It is said for heavy duty shocks but not. The 3 inch is the outside measurment. I needed 3 inch on the inside. My vehicle is a f 250. As the other review it is 26 dollars to return and I paid 23.88 so I'm stuck with them. My final words are as written on the box MADE IN CHINA.
3,Load Levelers for truck,The product worked but not without modifications. The box had both metric and SAE screws mixed and matched. The instructions were useless. Quality of material was OK after some mods.
5,great pen,"great repalcement for the one I lost. of course I found the one I lost2 weeks after getting this one. So now it is considered a spare, but exactly like the one that comes with the tablet."
5,absolutely terrific!,"i own several bad religion albums! this one is one of my favorites! ""overture"" is probably one of the best openers to an album i've ever heard!"
5,Bad Religion is back!,"...not that they ever really went away, but this is their finest album in years. This album packs a quick, fast, angry punch like the Bad Religion we know and love. Bad Religion fans and any fans of loud, fast, melodic, angry, smart punk rock will not be disappointed."
2,Eh...where is the Bad Religion I used to know??!,"This album is very pop. Some of the songs have music that resembles the new Green day album (yes that is an insult to BR). There are a good five songs on this disc but altogether the BR sound and spirit seems to have died years ago unfortunately. This seems to be the trend now...look at Pennywise!Even Greg's lyrics have been dumbed done. His vocab used to be incredible and was one of the things I always enjoyed in a BR album ...now it seems to have been dilluted.Have I mentioned there is a rap part in one of the songs? Yeah...pretty weird...If you want a good, more passionate Bad religion album get: SUFFER (one of the best punk albums of all time), the 80-85 discography, GENERATOR, AGAINST THE GRAIN, NO CONTROL, STRANGER THAN FICTION, or GRAY RACE."
2,Pop goes the BR,"I hadn't listened to BR in 7 years or so, and the stuff I remember listening to was far more punk than Empire Strikes First. They seem to have gone the way of Green Day pop/punk junk."
1,WORST B.R. YET!!!! WARNING!!!!!,"I am a long time B. Religion fan and went to their shows in the old days. Loved Process of Belief, and of course Suffer, No Control, etc.This is not those albums.This is nothing but a rush job put out so the boys could get in their two cents in about the Iraq war. Predictable left wing Chomsky parroting drivel set to uninspired cliche B.R. riffing and ooh ahhh ing. Not a memorable song here.Its a shame there is apparently no such thing as original, undogmatic thought in punk rock or on the left wing. This record could be a John Kerry speech! Real rebels. Go back to the heroin, Gurwitz, it made you think better.AVOID."
4,Bad Religion's most political CD,"Okay, this album was one I didn't originally care for too much. For whatever reason, I didn't find it as easy to get into its lyrics, and the second half of the CD isn't (in my opinion) nearly as strong the first half.But that said, after giving the CD a couple other times, I've reversed my opinion on it. Definitely one of the heavier punk CDs Bad Religion's done and I give them props for the first half, which powers ahead like a freight train. The 2nd half contains duds like Boot Stamping on a Human Face Forever and iffy ones like The Quickening and Beyond Electric Dreams. But this is overall a strong Bad Religion CD.I guess my problem with it is that its overly grand and often political lyrics are harder for me to relate to and get into than their other works. But that doesn't take away from a strong Bad Religion CD that isn't one of my favorites but it's better than I gave it credit for in my original 3-star review."
4,GREAT ALBUM,Haven't listened to Bad Religion since No Control was new. I came across this album by chance and I wasn't even sure they were still around. Boy oh boy! This album kicks ass! Now I have to go back a few albums to see what I've been missing.This album gets 4 stars because it is GREAT but not PERFECT!
5,Like a Fine Wine,"There have been many critics to Bad Religion, that their new albums may not have been as hard hitting as their older albums, Suffer for example. If Bad Religion would have kept putting out albums that sounded the same as the older ones they may have faded into the punk rock wash ten years ago. Bad Religion gets better with age, and continues to improve themselves, like the true renaissancial thinkers that they are. All of the tracks on this album expand the way that their sound has evolved, much like the difference between How can Hell be any Worse, and Suffer. There will always be critics, but this album is one that should be given a good listen to before you shelve it, because much like a good red, the songs get better with time."
4,"Awesome as Usual, but a little too political","First off let me say I have been a Huge Bad Religion Fan since the No Control days. They are without a doubt my all time favorite band. This album is really good but the political overtones get a little old. If I wanted to hear that I'd listen to some new NOFX. The songs themselves are fast and aggressive in classic BR fashion with Los Angeles is burning and Social Suicide being my favorites. So why the 4 star rating, seems like every other song is about the government, which I guess is what punk essentially about, but seems like it's over done on this one."
3,Leaves you wanting more,"Ok to start off this album is not terrible, but compared to most other bad religion cd's its not that great. Most B.R. cd's you listen to and you feel its complete well with the empire strikes back, you feel like you need more they left something out. Usually with a B.R. song you get the main song with a creative bridge or something added extra to complete the song with this album there is little of that.I would say this cd is good but not great. there is one flawless part of this cd, it has the song boot stomping on a human face forever. This is quite possibly one of the best Bad Religion songs.If you are a long time fan defiantly buy this album but if you are not you will be solely disappointed."
3,Dissappointing but it's Bad Religion...,"I've been into Bad Religion for at least ten years. I'm convinced that No Control is their best album and Stranger than Fiction was their last really good album. They seem to have been writing hits on all of their subsequent releases, which is fine, but they don't really stand up as albums. This new one falls in with their last few...some great catchy songs but pretty weak compared to their early stuff.Also, the guy who has a problem with Epitaph's left-wing politics doesn't seem to understand that Brett owns/started Epitaph and Bad Religion is one of the most consistently left leaning bands out there...they did a split with Noam Chomsky. I don't understand how people can be so confused about this stuff. Go listen to the new Metallica album or something."
3,sorry guys...not quite there,"I have every Bad Religion CD and don't rate this one too highly. I don't care that the band retreads familiar territory -- as long as the tunes are great. Unfortunately, on this disk, much like the Gray Race, the song writing leaves a lot to be desired. Stick to Against the Grain, No Control and Recipe for Hate. Even The New America is a more realized album. That said, this better than 99% of what is out there. Only buy if you are a real fan. For the unitiated see above."
3,Good but too spicy for me...,"Even though I did enjoy this item and the quality was fine, it was just a little too spicy for me to thoroughly enjoy it. I might look for a less spicy version next time."
4,Moonlight Secrets,"Well, I thought that Moonlight Secrets would have been better but it was good.When Candy always used to rub the stone I thought that she would have been doing all that stuff.When ever things used to happen she will be rubbing it and saying words nobody can hear.When cockroaches came out of his mouth that was gross!But the ending was very shocking.Once I found out the stone was fake I was suprised. I will be reading Midnight Games to see what happened."
4,Echoing the praises and complaints of others,"I was a bit concerned that this older card wouldn't run under Lion on my MacBook Pro, but it's doing just fine. I had been using a USB2 external drive to keep files I was working on, and it was just to slow. Now, not only can I transfer files across faster, but the access is actually fast enough to work off of live. My only complaint is the complaint that every else has... it doesn't stay in the ExpressCard slot securely. It's very easy to accidentally unseat it, causing lots of errors if you're in the middle of writing a file out. Other than that, it's certainly worth having, and is a noticable bump faster than the FW800 interface."
3,Relatively Technical,"Not everyone is founded in logic. Actually, most everyone is not. The author attempts to immeadiately aquaint the reader with arguments and inductive strength, when most readers are not prepared for such technical language right off the bat. It would have been better for Robert Johnson to have supplied modern textbook highlighting and sectional delineations and conversational language the reader can relate to rather than plain text and examples that read like computer programming. He does give examples that are easy to understand, but when you are not eased into it, the examples don't help."
3,Basic hand-held shower head,"Not bad, but very basic. Inexpensive, works well, but can not adjust position when mounted."
3,Who Designs These Things?,"The price was right, but the showerhead handle does not fit well enough into the indicated holder to keep it from shooting out and flopping around the bath when the water pressure starts. It also will not stay pointed forward under low pressure unless you wrap a rubber band around the base of the hose.You get what yoy pay for, I guess."
3,"Good quality, complete set ready to use.","I'm on holiday in the USA and will be using this product on my return to India next month. I am particularly happy that it came as a complete kit, ready to use ideal for DIY fans. Unfortunately I have not been able to try it here but feel I will not face any problems with it. Would be happy to give a review from there after using it."
3,User,"Cannot really rate it, because I've received defected item. Returned it to Amazon pretty quick with full refund and no shipping charges. 1 star to product, 5 starts to Amazon customer service."
4,works well but could be not so heavy,It is easily installed and works well but could be not so heavy
5,Clear and Concise,"I picked up this book a few weeks ago and TORE through it. It reads very well, and has lots of other book recommendations in it. Murphy is both funny and clear. I've been studying economics for years and have read many of the popular books. This one is one of the best."
5,Really great reading,"My husband is an economist, and well, I'm not. I like to know what he's up to though (and understand his conversation), and this book is incredibly entertaining and informative. He enjoyed reading it as well, and he has a PhD in the subject, so I think this is a must-read for anyone with a hint of interest in markets."
4,Solid Info for the Masses,"Like others in this series, it is intended, more or less, as a beginner's guide; it's basic material for those who know just a smattering about the subject (which includes anyone who went to public school, or had a few college courses in economics).I can't agree with the author 100%, but he presents the subject briskly and succinctly, and he properly defends true capitalism as the only economic system that can possibly succeed in the real world."
1,what?,"where did they dig this guy up from? is he a stooge for the romney campaign or ? this book is full of rightwing assertions, half truths and out right lies! shame, just shameful. this is just another example why i dislike the neo conservative right wingers as much as i do. if they are so right about everything, then why lie all the damn time. the sad reality is that so many fall for this bunk? i want them to know, i know better and they ain't pulling nothing over on me."
1,Don't pay for this...,"If you feel a need to read about his fictitious market humorously described as ""free"", you can go to the Mises website and not have to pay for this terrible, politically motived book."
2,Cheetah could've written a better story,I have gone about 1/3 of the way through this book and have been very disappointed. The events are told unevenly and there is little insight to this potentially great story or stories behind the man. I thought I would get greater insight from his son but so far very little is revealed. The writing is very choppy and I am surprised that the professional writers helping JR couldn't write more fluently. It is like they took all the notes and forgot how to put them into words. the book is extremely short and is more like a magazine article. There seemed to be so much waiting to be told. Amazon should send half my money back because all I got was half a story.
5,Jam packed with goodies!,"This is one of the greatest computer books I've ever owned.If you are a beginner, you can open this book, and find all kinds of great tools and techniques you never knew about before. Everything is described briefly, in just a page or two, so you can immediately get something out of it. If you are more advanced, you will find yourself flipping through pages, saying, ""Yes, I knew that. Yes, I knew that. Oh, I didn't know that!""This book is jam packed with tips, techniques and tutorials. If you're a serious UNIX user or shell programmer, this is an extremely handy book to have around. It's only negative might be that there is just so much in here, it is sometimes overwhelming. On the up side, there is an excellent index at the back."
5,Very Good Reference Book.,I found this book very much useful as I am not a regular unix programmer. This book is good for knowing all unix commands and shell scripting.
5,After a Thorough Search We Picked This One!,"This is a solid, compact ipod ""boombox""(15"" w, 7"" high, 4"" deep)for desk top, shelf, or picnics. Runs on batteries or AC. Comes with built in dock, and easy to use adapters to accommodate any model ipod. Charges ipod when using AC. Has a wireless remote. Most importantly, the sound is terrific! We listened to about 10 similar devices in the $130 to $200 range. We tried opera, country, heavy metal, reggae, jazz tunes on each, to check out how they handle different sounds. This is the one we bought. We're completely satisfied."
4,Won't work IPhone or newest Nano on docking station,The sound is great. Disappointed that I cannot dock the I phone or newest Nano. Have to use auxiliary jack which is fine but I was hoping the docking station would work with the Nano so I could use the remote while at the office. Can only dock an I Touch and the older version Nano. Great sound though.
2,Good sound baddesign,Good sound but wasted money because you can't use any ipod but the original to charge. Gets two stars for sound.
5,IMPRESSIVE!,Was impressed by the good reviews so I took a chance on a cheap product since this will be used at the beach anyway. The sound is much better than I would have anticipated. As many people said it does distort when played very loud but I was surprised that it even went that high to begin with. For the money I am buying another one!
3,Not THAT great,"Just got this boom box and I'm a bit disappointed -- the sound is not nearly as good as the other reviews and the writeup here indicated. Really sounds like what it is, a boom box with heavy bass, not a high-fidelity speaker docking system. And there is no button on the unit for fine-tuning, adding more treble or otherwise creating a different mix. The sound is nowhere near as good as the Logitech system that I bought when I got my iPod Nano 3G, and for the listed ""true"" price of $179 I'd be returning it! But for my purposes (ambient music for healing bodywork sessions) and a modest $25, it will be fine. Still better than the iHome clock radio I tried recently..."
2,READ THIS BEFORE YOU BUY THIS ITEM,"This boom box cannot have batteries in it when it is plugged-in to an electrical unit. It says this explicitly in the user guide that comes with it. So that means, you have to take the batteries out if you want to plug it into the wall. I know it's hard to believe, but it's true. It also didn't come with an adaptor for the new smaller Nano. It just comes with an adaptor for the old Nano - but there's no way to know this when you try and put your new Nano in, it just doesn't fit and you don't know why. The unit is very heavy after you put in the 8 C size batteries. I'm returning it and getting a Logitec unit instead. Bummer that Amazon is making me pay for the shipping to return it because they say the reason for return is my fault. I wouldn't have bought it if I had known what I know now."
3,recv wrong watch,hello there. I recv the wrong watch. what can I do to return and recv the right item.problem with watch is arms in watch are orange color.
3,"beautiful, attractive, precise, but rubber strap is disappointing","Its a great looking watch, accurate time always, reasonably priced for its counterparts Swiss watches. Only issue is the rubber strap. It broke form one side after 13 months of gentle use. The replacement is not available easily and I had to order from Skagen cost me $25 with shipping. Next year same piece broke again. The design of strap attachment is unique so can't install any generic/standard strap."
2,Strap is CRAP,I'm a Watchmaker and I have one of these (same strap as the 350). The rubber strap is rubbish. The watch was new but the band ripped at the mounting point. I've been trying to get a new one but Skagen don't do them anymore (according to the agent here in NZ) and Internet seller wants over $100 US for one.Paul ;-(
3,Nice watch...I hope it's just the battery,"Looks like a nice watch... the face is one of the few LEGIBLE chronograph designs that you can actually see the hands position without constantly squinting and reexamining. The watch is thicker than it appears to be, but that's fine. Initially adjusting the time with the crown is pretty confusing.It stopped working after 5 months; I hope it's just the battery"
1,Agree with everyone below - terrible watch!,"This was a birthday gift from my wife, and no sooner had the grace period for returning it expired than the band broke. Nothing out of the ordinary happened; as near as I can tell the rubber that connects to the watch face just disintegrated.Avoid this one at all costs!"

3,not sure yet.,I bought this thinking it was a small sand like particles...but it's much larger. Hasn't shown any change with moisture...don't know if this will help my plants unless the roots are touching it. We already have clay soil here where I live....I don't know why I bought more clay.
3,My Little Demon,"Having read and enjoyed Sanami Matoh's ""FAKE,"" I checked out another one of Matoh's works, ""By the Sword."" The story begins when Asagi the Karinin, a bounty hunter of demons, runs into Kaede, a strong but nave young girl carrying the magic sword Moegi. Unfortunately, Asagi also meets Kaede's father Kurenai, a notorious demon who lost his body, leaving behind its irritable spirit. When Asagi discovers that only he can draw the Moegi, he joins Kaede and Kurenai on a quest to recover Kurenai's body.No matter how much they may differ from each other, these samurai-themed manga all look the same. Whether it's bandits or demons or warlords in your way, you're always on this long journey, slicing through your foes and stuffing your face along the way. But what saves ""BTS"" from being a total loss is the unique blend of action and humor that only Matoh can bring to the table.This comic is rated for ages 13 and up: Graphic Violence, Adult Language."
3,Brutally Honest Look at Family Life,"While this was not my favorite of the Today Show book club series, I have to say that the one thing that really impressed me as I read The Sleeping Father, was the brutal honesty. At times I would cringe, or be embarrassed for a character, or feel their pain. For that, I have to give Mr. Sharp kudos!"
1,Don't bother!,"This book is one of the worst I've ever read. The characters are unlikeable, the writing is stilted, the plot is completely unbelievable. Hospital sends the father home, with no responsible adult to care for him? Church accepts large donation from a minor? Doctor becomes WAY over involved and acts unethically (OK, maybe that isn't unrealistic, but....hopefully very rare)? The ending is equally unrealistic, and made me think the author was desperate to just end the book, and contrived the big drama to just get it over with. It made me cringe. This book is not funny, it is not entertaining, it is not inspirational or even heart-felt. I'm really not sure what the author's intent was. I read this as part of my book club, and we all hated it."
4,A good youth reader,"A better youth reader than Catcher in the Rye. The young people in this book are finding their way through adolescence. The adults seem like relatively real people. Plot is stretched a little beyond the reasonable for dramatic effect. Often what the boy, Chris, says and reflects about things is too verbal and penetrating for his age, like he says stuff that only years later would one realize might have been just the right reaction in the moment. But that prescience, that spot on, delicious riposte made the book delightful to me."
2,Not worthy of a National Book Club,"Very disappointed. Bought this book because of the Today Show Book Club award. Very sarcastic, mildly funny, but I am disappointed because the family structure here is completely simplified and unrealistic. I find Chris and Cathy to be spoiled and unlikeable. They have the rebel without a cause syndrome of rich spoiled kids who have never had a real tragedy in their lives. Not horrible, but definitely not worth the $14 I spent on it."
4,Witty and insightful family drama,"The writing is incredibly funny at times. The situation is interesting and poignant, and Sharpe handles it very well without becoming maudlin. Sharpe's insights are on target and extremely well crafted. My only dissatisfaction with this novel was that the main character kind of wore on me after awhile. However, it was a very good book, and I recommend it, particularly if you are looking for something unique."
2,Few highlights,"The novel was recommended in a Swiss newspaper and it sounded like an interesting book. However, I found it rather disappointing. The plot is weak and the ending contrived and implausible. To my mind Sharpe didn't succeed in mixing satire, social realism, psychological insight and fantasy into a literary satisfying text. There are some real highlights, individual scenes and descriptions and dialogues, in which the author shows talent. But there are not enough to create a great novel."
2,lousy and depressing,"This book is basically made up of several people who are caricatures of the most negative traits a person can have. If you think people are essentially flawed and unpleasant than this is the book for you. I, however, found it to be depressing and pointless. The story line was so promising..."
1,One star is overly generous.,"Contrived, marginally written at best, and wholly unoriginal I would have sued the school board if I were forced to read this book for credit. The characters are as one-dimensional and wooden in their caricature as a picture of the novel itself. This was clearly the author's vehicle to immpress readers with his delusional ""gift"" of dry wit, sarcasm and feined adolescent angst; Mr. Sharpe, you are no J.D. Salinger. At best, you make Dave Barry look like (worthy) Pulitzer-prize material."
3,Another hit on Jews,This book wasn't bad but having a major theme of Cathy's following Jew to Catholicism Edith Stein was another hit Jews didn't need right now.
3,Only for diehard fans,"I love Take 6. Their ministry is an incredible blessing, and listening to their music has brought me a lot of joy and comfort.Having said that, I really think that although the performance on <i>Live</i> CD is amazing, the CD is hugely disappointing from a technical standpoint. The miking is terrible -- popping P's and nasty sibilants and gobs of prox effect on the bass. Just listen to ""I'm On My Way"" -- the bass is in your face and the lead line sounds like it's being sung from the back of the hall. (Yes it's live, but miking for a cd should be different than miking for sound reinforcement.)I get the feeling that this CD was rushed to market. If Reprise/WEA really cared about the quality of their product, they should have given the project a little more thought. If this is your first exposure to Take 6, buy another of their CDs first, like <i>So Cool</i> or one of the two Christmas CDs."
5,Cool!,"I really enjoyed this CD. I've seen Take 6 in concert three times before and always wanted to have a live recording. So this CD made me happy. This group never ceases to amaze me. If you like harmony, soul, gospel, jazz and accappella, you will like this CD. Take 6 ""Live"" may also impress you to buy their other CD's too!"
4,Primal Rage,"One of the best 'FIGHTER'S"" around,where else can beat up on dino's. and other fantastic creature's!"
4,Good protection,I have a black one of these and and highly recommend them if you want reasonable protection from moisture and EXCELLENT protection from scratches. Toss the plastic LCD protector and buy a stick-on film (Exim makes a good one) and it won't add any bulk to your camera...stick it in your pocket with your keys w/o worries!
2,Doesn't quite fit,"It has all the right features. It looks just like the picture. I love that I don't have to remove the camera from the cover to take a picture, but the openings for the controls don't *quite* line up. The LCD cover is a hard, clear, plastic piece that floats over the screen and is not connected to the rest of the camera cover. I wouldn't buy it again."
5,Nice protective case,"I am very satisfied with the camera skin. The skin looks just as it does in the picture, and is just like those various ipod skins. There is a hard plastic screen cover as well. The skin covers the lens. I also like how the skin is not so thick that it interferes with the camera's usage; all buttons/dials are still accessible and easy to use, and the camera still fits into my camera bag.My only issues are that the straps included look/feel cheap, and despite the skin being worth the money, this seems like the sort of item I could get cheaper at a brick and mortar store, especially considering that shipping is like 25% of the shipped price."
3,Gaps in the explanations limit this book' s effectiveness,"Not bad. Not great. In the middle. The problem is that there are significant gaps in explanations of techniques, with ""buzzwords"" thrown in in place of detail (eg, ""Follow through""...Cluck needs to explain HOW to follow through and WHAT's involved in following through, not just to follow through). On several occasions, I would turn the page and think I'd gone a page or two too far because the explanations...would...just...END!My son did the SDSB program...it was overpriced for the benefit received. Don't be fooled by the endorsements...Gwynn and Trammell are part owners of SDSB, so of course they are going to endorse the book!"
1,battery cheese grader ?,"The only thing it grated was my nerves ,a total waste of money.It didn' do it. slower than molasses this december,Don't buy it ..It was so bad that I threw it in the garbage!! Warning,you've been told"
3,It's still Tecmo.,"As a Tecmo Bowl addict since the very first game, I too was really dissapointed when I first played this game.I was mostly set back by the lack of advancement. After the Special Edition and the Final Edition, the Tecmo Series grew from it's early days with putting realism of the roster management into the arcade play. The onfield graphics were improving, too.This game just didn't take the jump you'd expect from SNES to PS.This game is almost an exact copy of the NES Tecmo Super Bowl. The only upside to this game is the unlimited roster editing."
1,Terrible,"I have always been a huge fan of the Tecmo bowl/Superbowl series, and I bought this hoping it would be the best one as it came out in '96 on the playstation, yet it's one of the worst games I've ever seen. I'm sure it's playable once you get ""used to it"", but the graphics and sounds are the worst of any game in the series. I find it hard to believe Tecmo released this"
2,Don't Buy,"You cannot learn how to snowboard without actually being out on the hill and actually putting ideas into action. Take lessons on the hill, don't bother buying this book. I've been snowboarding for a few years and am fairly good, this book did not improve my riding anymore than one more day on the hill improves my riding. my suggestion...instead of buying this book to get better, take a lesson. If you can already ride fairly good, instead of buying this to get better, simply go shred as much as you can, try a few new things (such as rails, jumps, and powder) and you will get better."
4,good material for people who want to improve,"I just came to Amazon to order this book based on a friend getting it for her nephew. I told her to get Warren Miller's Freeriders video, but when she couldn't find it she settled on this, and showed it to me before she gave it to him. I'm an intermediate level boarder, 31 years old, who just started riding this winter and even just skimming through the book for ten minutes before I had to hand it back I picked up several useful tips I'm going to try out at Smuggs in all this fresh snow we're getting. Then when the book gets here from Amazon, I'll find some more things to try."
5,Great Help!!!,"This book is great for beginners like me. This one includes lots of illustration, so it's extremely easy to understand what it's trying to explain. After reading this, I got a lesson for beginners. The instructor just repeated what I read from this. If you intend to start snowboarding this winter, read this first. Then, you'll get to know what you need to prepare and expect in practice."
5,Very Good Instruction and Info,"This actually is a very well written and thorough book. I also have ""The Complete Snowboarder"", which (to me, anyway) is not nearly as insightful and useful, although it is a good book.Of course, it is obvious that the best way to get better is to ride, but . . . if you want to read some of the best descriptions of the mechanics of snowboarding, this book has it.Get some lessons, of course, but I really think that beginners thru intermediates can learn at least a few things from this book. I personally learned a LOT. Highly highly recommend."
1,The Koran (Everyman Paperback Classics),"For my first look at the Koran, I chose this book because of the price and the Everyman reputation. However I cannot recommend this translation to any one. Any translation is only as uplifting as the consciousness of the translator, and Rodwell translates in the most negative terms. This translation is full of infidels and how terrible people are. I tried hard to find two consecutive sentences that I could quote that would show beauty or spirituality, and it was almost impossible. Try another translator! In contrast is Cleary's translation which gives one a sense of wonder and understanding. He has translated other texts and can impart the underlying spirituality."
1,Bad tranlation,"The Koran (Bantam Classic)I bought this version of translation out of curiosity. i have read the Holy Quran few times. After leafing through this book, i came to Sura (chapter) 30. The Arabic tranlation and correct name of Sura is "" The Romans"" but in this book just says "" The Greeks"" if the translator does not know the diffrence between The Greeks and The Romans it makes this translation work very weak and questionable."
4,I miss this game.,"My little brother had lent this game out, and I never saw it agian. This IS the best game in its genre (which I guess falls into action). You get to take over a cities population, steal some flying cars, and rob a bank when you get low on cash to fund your new developing weapons. Definatly worth checking out even with it being as old as it is."
1,Frustrating,"There are a lot of typographic errors in my copy of this book. The errors in cross-references are merely annoying; those that appear in equations are likely confound the novice. There are, of course, exercises presented in each chapter, but no solutions. Not even a simple appendix containing the final answers."
1,PChem,"This book is a waste of money! I am currently an under-grad looking for some tutorial help for my Quantum course and purchased the book without reviewing Amazon's feedback reviews. Wish I would have done so before I bought it. Although this book provides some example questions with solutions, they are few. And the chapter problems don't have any answers to examine. This author or publisher needs to re-think their approach."
3,Mathematics for Physical Chemists Third Edition,This textbook was pretty expensive and is pretty easy to understand. But it doesn't even have colored pictures.
2,do not use on tagheuer,"this does not work for a tagheuer watch that has the sleeve/tube and pins. It jammed the pin and i ended up having to go to the jeweler for repair, first littmans's then fortunoff was finally able to fix and polish the links that were damaged. I read a review on how this worked for a tag but it does not work for the 2000 series women's. I didn't return it because the shipping would cost as much as the product. It does work for cheaper watches, it works on my fossil watches. overall i ended up paying double for link removal and not saving money by purchasing this item."
4,Nice for the price,"I like it and it work, need something that open wider with longer pins for bigger watch bands."
1,It fell apart before I could even try it.,"No wonder they discounted this product from 19.95 to 3.95, it was a piece of junk. A knob immediately fell off which caused the spring loaded bed to fly across my desk with the two springs also flying out of the device. This rendered it useless so I could not even try it. Now I can send it back and pay more for shipping than the refund I will receive. This is a very bad deal and I am very dissappointed in both Micro Tools and Amazon. (added 3 days later) However, in response to my email, Micro Tools has given me a full refund including shipping costs. So product was defective, but customer service was good."
2,ho hum.,"I used 2 times to remove the pins for the links in my watch, the inserts for it bend pretty easiley, it did what I neede it to do before it bit the dust, I guess for 4 bucks it's ok."
2,Doesn't Work With Wide Bands,"This product may be a decent product, but it does not work with wide male bands. It definitely did not fit any of my Swiss and Nixon bands. Because of this limited functionality, I can not recommend this product to anyone other than someone who has narrow band watches."
4,nice and cheap tool,I have fixed 5 watches so far with one tool pin brokenPROS:1) easy to fix a link2) Quick to get startedCONS:1) Difficult for broad watch bands. It still worked for my over sized Fossil. This is clearly mentioned in on the site that it is to be used on bands less than an inch thick - so I think its alright.The housing for the pin is wide open as a result the pin rotates with some displacement instead of rotating at one fixed point. as a result pointing this pin with the link hole can be tough some times.but still very good tool - considering the money you can save. Just make sure that you are removing the links in the direction indicated on your watch.
2,Didn't get what I paid for,"I purchased a product titled Heavy Duty that clearly shows via picture which is heavy duty. Nor sure why they say either one is orange. However, I recieved the standard duty one. [...]Looking at the reviews, I don't even believe there is a heavy duty product other than the one used in the picture. No one seems to ever have gotten one. Therefore, I paid for a product and recieved the wrong product. I think I may advertise something at a ""mark-downed"" price and swap it with soemthing cheaper and count on people being too unconcerned with such a small amount to complain. Oh, wait. [...]"
2,Why is Blue considered Orange,"Thanks I received the pin pusher in the mail. I thought that It was going to be the orange pusher that I looked at. Is this the same as the orange one that I ordered . This pin pusher, Is blue. Do you people call your orange pusher, this particular item JT6305A. I am confused. I have this item already, I thought that I was upgrading. Dennis Howarth......."
3,Have to work at it to get the job done,"I purchased this tool thru another retailer. So far, what I have seen is that you have to very careful lining up the needle tip with the watch band. A shot of WD40 is also in order. I will try using it in daylight and sitting it on a workbench. With a wide watch band (I am stuck with a Relics man watch), you don't have alot of space to engage the pins. It will be interesting!Update: I got the tool to work by using one hand to adjust the angle of the band while turning the screw handle. Don't rely on the base of this tool to align the pin correctly."
1,heavy duty watch band tool,recently i purchase this item i will never buy nor suggest any one to buythis item.i tried to remove pin from watch bend which has link pin @45 angle there is no way i can remove pin with this lower grade pin removal.g patel
1,Barely fits my bands,"I was surprised when I saw so many positive reviews on product and went ahead and bought it. Unfortunately the opening is wide enough to barely fit on bands 20 to 22mm size, so if you own watches with larger bands this won't be of any use. If you have smaller watch bands this tool should work ok, out of my collection of 15 watches I could only get 2 to fit in this tool."
4,Watch Band Tool,"Great Tool for anyone who has ever needed to adjust a watch band.I have used the tool on several watches, with great success and savings. My wife has small wrists, requiring adjustment to all her watches. Watches which I have not used for years are back in service, after a quick adjustment. First watch I worked on, paid for the tool."
5,Seiko Watch,I am very pleased with my purchase. This is my second kinetic watch andI have never had any problem. Very accurate and great looking!
5,Gets the job done,"I read where others say, just use a small screwdriver - well, I tried that and somehow it is hard to get the leverage/force to get some pins out (plus ""protect"" the side of your watch band) - maybe it works on some watches - but I learned long ago, ""get the right tool"".I got this and this worked within seconds - it was soooo easy. Plus if you have an expensive watch, do you really want to rig up a little screwdriver or use a specific-made watch tool ?I already know this tool has paid for itself than having to go to a jeweler - I can use this for friends and family, too."
2,"It works, but just barely","The problems with this item are lack of instructions and the quality of the steel pin. Luckily I found some instructions on how to resize watch bands online and solved this problem. The pin for this tool is very soft steel and will quickly bend, forcing you to bend it straight again. You can usually get it to work but its extremely cheap and not recommended if you are doing multiple watches."
2,You get what you pay for,This didn't cost much so I guess I got what I expected. The inserts broke under the stress of pushing the watch pins.
5,"Work as described, easy to use, well worth the money",Adjusted my Citizen Eco Drive with no problem. Quick and easy with no confusion. Just follow the very easy to understand instruction and you will be fine.
3,Maybe I'm missing something here.,"The product description is for a heavy duty orange tool. The product illustration shows blue. I ordered it anyway. Upon arrival I saw that the tool was indeed blue and did not seem to be 'heavy duty'.Trying to use it I found that the driving pin is very loose. It just flip-flopped around, I had to jiggle the tool while screwing down the knob and hope that it would line up with the watch band pin. There is no room to reach in and guide the alignment. After several tries it did line up and I was able to drive out the retaining pin. For such a cheap price I guess I can understand that it's not accurate, orange, or heavy duty."
3,Watch Band Tool Link Remover for Watch Bands,"I don't regret buying this widgit because it actually did help me resize my new watch band. But it doesn't come with any instructions. The seller included some internet references on watch band resizing that were somewhat halpful. If you know what you are doing, a small paper clip or safety pin is also helpful."
3,Ok for the price.,"Made of cheap plastic, but it works fine for adjusting watch bands. For the price it is ok."
5,The hottest CD for this Fall 2004,When I first heard this CD I was like I had to find out who it was. I loved City Streets the first time I heard it and that was about two weeks ago. I listened to the album and it's hot. I ordered it and can't wait to get it....Looking forward to the next and the next and the next one.ThanksLee LeeNew YorkMuch thanks to CD101.9 FM - Dennis Quinn for playing it!!!!
3,too small to carry much,"I wear XL dive fins (about 26"" long, 11"" wide) and that's all you can fit in here with effort. With smaller fins you may be able to fit something else in it. Material/construction seems OK."
2,"Repetitive, endless sex scenes","These books are back to back very similar sex scenes, most involving explicit anal sex. I prefer more of a story line and more originality when it comes to the sex scenes. I was disappointed because I liked the premise of these books and bought the first two in the series. I'll check out the second book, but if it's the same as this one they'll both be going to the second hand book store pronto."
5,Story line comes first...,"Dont' get me wrong. If there is a sex scene in a book, I want it steamy !!!! But, if you are like me, and the story line is the main reason that you buy a book, you won't be dissappointed with Shiloh Walker's books.I originally read both stories in ""Hunters: The Beginning"" as individual e-books. I much prefer paper books so when this book came out I ordered several. One for my keeper shelf, and others to introduce friends to Ms. Walker.The interaction between the characters in this book is searing. Their love for each other undoubtable. As other characters come into play you will find yourself hungering for a book that tells their stories. Witches, Healers of the Earth, Vampires and Werewolves fill the pages.Ms. Walker's book is steamy, soft, hard edged, and exciting all at the same time.Any book by Ms. Walker will be an automatic buy for me !Karen ""K"" Farmer"
2,Not Free SF Reader,"Ok, this is porn. Or, erotic romance as the publisher seems to call it. When you look them up, you will see that all becomes clear.A cop and a guy are dancing around each other, but the bloke is a werewolf. The girl gets vampirised before he can stop it, and the circumstances surrounding her first feeding (him) and other things means she becomes some legendary mythological Huntress.Super supernatural, and super hornbag. Seems the werewolves are pretty much like that already.Given this is not porn reader, we will rate it as such."
1,No story here at all,"""Hunter's Choice"" was a free novella in this series. I thought it was pretty good, even if the characters were a little under-developed. Hey - what do you expect from a novella? So I figured I'd start the series. This was awful. I couldn't finish it. There's a moderate thread of story between a whole lot of sex of all kinds - mild domination, anal, I gave it up when it looked like we were headed for a three-way. If you're into all that and don't particularly care if your read has a plot or likeable characters - this one's for you. If you're actually looking for a paranormal romance - keep on looking."
3,Stronger than paranormal romance,"This first book is very hardcore. It is much more sexually graphic than the rest of the series. This first book makes JR Ward's Black Dagger Brotherhood series look like Twilight in comparison. If you are a practicing Catholic, it will make you feel guilty enough to think about going to confession. Even though I felt guilty, I read both books and enjoyed them."
1,Boring after a while...,"I began to read this book and liked it, but after some pages I began to grow bored because it always was the same: sex, sex and more sex. Ok, I'm not a prude, and I like a book that has hot scenes on it, but usually I prefer my books to have a story and sex on it, but always leaning on a story that keeps you interested in the book. In this book I got the impression that the story wasn't important as soon as they were having sex. As I said, I like a book with a story and sex, not sex as a story.Sorry, but after reading the first story and beginning the second one, I couldn't keep reading because the second story on the book hinted to be exactly as the first one: all sex with some second or third thought to an idea of a story that should keep all the sex tied up. I mean, that had to have all the story tied up. This book felt very much as a porn movie: after some time it all seems the same. Not a keeper for me."
4,Great read.,"I've gotten to the point where reading the sex is no longer necessary to me, I sometimes gloss over it. I loved the characters and the snarky dialog. Point of fact, I liked this book so much I ordered the others. I do wish there were more details given about the main character, as well as how the 'Hunters' came into affect."
3,Extremely Fun-If U Dont Mind The Graphics!,"This game is absolutly hilarious, if u dont mind the pour graphics.Your worms dont have alot of options but have enough to stimulate.One thing thats sad is when u play against the game itself u almost always lose!PROS:Fun.Bad graphics make simple, in a sense.Easy to learn.CONS:Extremely bad graphics.Least amount of Weapon Options.Game will always beat u if u play against it."
2,Book of Majors,A waste. A huge price for something that is immediately out of date. Don't buy it. Find it in your counselor's office or at the library instead.
3,The Girls Next Door,"Those cover girls look familiar... ah yes, they are both tour guides at Trinity College. I heard they were in a a doublemint ad recently, so I guess they're pretty typecast. If you ask me, I think they ate a little to much hay growing up."
5,Classic and a favorite!!,"Cannot say enough about the episode of ""The Cabin"" - such an original plot involving our Matt Dillon! It's true we don't get all the characters together in this one but hey, once in a while it's okay to break the mold! This episode is one of my favorites and am so glad to have it on VHS! The unforgettable Harry Dean Stanton and Claude Akins star as the baddies...and Matt has to go up against them himself.....watch it, you won't be disappointed!"
2,Old news. Next.,"I work in the business but not on Wall Street. I have read quite a few books on the business and this is one of the more forgettable. It possibly would be interesting to someone who doesn't know much about the business and it does attempt to be funny, but frankly, it's really not. Pass on this one and look for the next Liar's Poker. This one has been done before and better."
1,A half-hearted attempt at best,"What looked to be a promising collection of tales from the street fizzled almost from the start. Fairly lame stories, told with almost no writing style or flair whatsoever. And to top it all off, no appearance of editing at all. References made to ""Truman winning the election of 1946"" (he beat Dewey in '48) and ""Home Depot, the home office supply store"" (that would be Office Depot). I felt ripped off, and I got it from the Library! Save your money and re-read Liar's Poker or A Piece of the Action."
1,Just a bad book,The book is of little value to anyone whether you are a professional investor or an amateur. Most of the stories are bland and simply not funny nor do they provide any insight whatsoever into the world of Wall Street. Bottom line: don't waste your time and money on this book.
3,Wall Street Lite,Read the book if you want to be entertained. Find another one if you want to learn about investing.
1,Traders' Tales is literally worthless,There is nothing of value in this collection of a 1-2 page stories for either the novice or experienced trader or investor. It is beyond me how this book was seen as attractive enough to actually publish. There is nothing useful whatsoever that a trader or investor can use in his or her market strategies.
1,Abscess makes the heart strings falter,"I can honestly say that I have never read a romance novel in which the hero and the heroine first meet over the huge pus-filled mass in his abdomen.Exchanging glances over the mangled body of toddler impaled on a tree limb, ooooh romantic.Believe me, escapism in romance is still allowable."
2,This Is Not Resident Evil,"The Alone in the Dark series has actually been around longer than Resident Evil. Acknowledged as pioneering the ""survival horror"" genre, Alone in the Dark did not keep up with it's imitators. This installment (One Eyed Jack's Revenge) on the Playstation has poor graphics and unbelievably long load times. You can be shooting at monsters and the system will seemingly freeze as the game has to load a new screen. Resident Evil beats this game in every way. If you've beaten all the Resident Evils and have a lot of patience to wait for the loads, this may be a fun diversion but don't expect it to ""wow"" you."
3,Good for Morphological Studies,"Not for the timid of heart! A good lexicon, esp. for morphological analysis. Try Perschbacher's for parsing and others for semantics."
4,very usable,This lexicon although not complete or exhaustive is a valuable resource for those who need help in translating biblcal greek but are not going to engage in very extensive research.
4,The Analytical Lexicon of the Greek New Testament,"I have recenty studied New Testament Greek and this is useful for tracking down words not in the limited lexicon at the back of my textbook. It shows the lexical form and the actual form used which is helpful, as I cannot always indentify the word. I was hoping it would show relationships between words and nuances, but it does not seem to do this.It is inexpensive compared with another recommended lexicon.I have only had this for a few weeks."
4,Badass speakers,"Man all I can say is these speakers rock! I have a set of 4-6.5"" and these 4-8"" speakers with a amp pushing the 8""s and damn you can hardly hear yourself think! I definitely recommend these speakers as a good purchase! Once you have these jamming out you won't want anything different!!!"
3,No driver updates !!!,Purchased for a new notebook with windows Vista. Yet drivers for kyb are not available. Company responded that they are not going to update drivers soon. Too bad !!! I have no use for the product.
4,great for typing on PDA,"i bought this for my college age son and he loves it! he uses it to take notes in class, hooked up via bluetooth to his cellphone/PDA"
3,Provides good coverage,"Easy to apply, goes on smoothly and provides good coverage. Not noticeably different than other brands."
3,Clever but corny,"The only reason I went to the cinema to see this film is because I was in it! (Very briefly) However that was quickly forgotten as early as during the opening credits. What an explosive beginning! It is a very clever story. It flips backwards and forwards in time so it is not clear what is going on until about two thirds of the way through. Unfortunately it is unnecessarily wordy, unrealisticly so. But if you can bear that it is worth sticking around until the end. One of the highlights is Captain Pickard LINEDANCING! Though I wasn't looking at him, I was too busy trying to see myself! (My part was uncredited, big BOO HOO)"
4,"Before the organization man, there was the super-organized desk system","This beautiful little book (94 pages) does a fine job of documenting the physical culture of mid-to-late 19th century office culture, with special attention to the masterful joinery that created intricate pigeon-holed desks. The photos in the back show gorgeous examples, including the Rockefeller Extra, the elaborate desk used by John D."
5,Great Value,"Brake pads from: SOL'S AUTO PARTSThe brake pads arrived in a timely manner (about 3 days) and for free shipping from this seller was great!The brake pads I received are asbestos free and are the metallic brake pad type.The pads did not come with any grease compound but I am not entirely sure these need grease but you can always get a pack from your local auto parts store.I paid a little over 13 dollars for these when my local auto parts store is selling them for $23. I may have waited a couple of days but the shipping was free.Besides, if you check your vehicle regularly and know when to replace these types of items waiting and saving go hand in hand because you are in no hurry."
5,Very Personable and Deep Book...,"I think that this was an awsome read. It talks about how African American women relate things with psychology, culture and hair. To me this book was very personal. For many women hair is more than just hair and there are lots of complexities as to why we wear our hair the way we may, or who makes those choices and how society may feel about ourt hair (rather straight or kinky)."
2,Christmas story collection,Please note these are not stories written by Pearl S Buck but favorite Christmas tales like A Christmas Carl and Gift ogf the Magi; it's a nice assortment
2,"Nice but flimsy, disintegrated after 15 months","After 15 months, this sheet has disintegrated--just worn right through in a large area. It was nice while it lasted but not worth buying because not durable."
3,Its okay,"Its a good general purpose sharpener. Will get your knives sharp for most uses. I use it on my mothers Henkles. Can scratch the blade if not careful. Too gritty for a razor sharp edge.The guide is useless, the honing solution runs out quick. I used running water instead."
4,A good basic MP3 player,"The SanDisk Sansa M260 is the highest capacity (4 GB) flash-memory based MP3 player currently available that takes standard AAA batteries. I have found it easy to use, both for listening to MP3's and the FM tuner. (I have not used the voice recorder.) I have used the player only with MP3's ripped from CDs I own, not with a subscription music service. The sound quality is good.Pros: Easy to use, good amount of storage space, takes standard AAA batteries, FM tuner.Cons: A little bulky, although it fits in a standard shirt pocket; the headphones did not fit my ears and I replaced them with the Sony MDR-EX51LP, which are very comfortable; the LCD display is hard to read when the player is in the plastic case that comes with it and you are wearing sun glasses (which I usually am when I am using it outside)."
3,love/hate relationship,"I, a 40 year old, finally got with the times and got an MP3 player. After doing the necessary research and asking advice of others I bought the Sansa 260. What I do not uderstand is the complete lack of a ""how to"" guide with this products. Maybe it's my age (wow, that sounded ""old"") but to me, this technology is not intuitive...in other words, I don't know what to do nor how to do it. The website is no help, and the ""quick start"" included is worthless. I've had lots of learnings that are trial and error and hit and miss...if there was a way to troubleshoot this thing -- either online or through a manual, I would be less tempted to throw it out the window. Right now I'm listening to it; I tried to switch songs and selected one, but instead the CD that I downloaded started playing over...but the song I selected is showing as ""now playing."" Argh! So, yes it's great for convenience, but from a practical standpoint it's a pain in the...."
3,Overpriced compared to the m250,"Now that the m250(2GB) player is so cheap, it doesn't make sense to pay almost 200 dollars for this unit.Don't get me wrong, i love the player, and nothing beats the long lasting battery life, and utilizing a single AAA battery is its best feature if you ask me.BUT you can get 10 m250's for the price of ONE m260 right now.."
3,a little dissapointed,"I bought my original Sandisk m260 and ran into a lot of trouble trying to cync music onto it from my computer. After lots of technical support e-mails I sent it back and Amazon sent me a new one. I've had some trouble with the new one as well but finally got it to sync most of my music library. I don't know what will happen when I try to add more music, since I've only used about 2GB of the 4GB available. Every time I try to add music I am forced to reformatt the player which wipes everything off and I must start over. I am not pleased with the inability to see the artist's name on the player, everything is listed as unknown. I would also like to be able to select an album at a time but can only scroll through the 412 songs one at a time."
2,Dissapointing,"Great looking and easy to use, but when the unit came, it wouldn't play any of the songs, WMA or MP3. When I pushed the play button, the pause icon wouldn't go away. Didn't want to exchange it, returned it fast and easy."
1,Died After 6 Hours,"I was attracted to the M260 as I could Drag&Drop my wma files. That was easy. I also liked the use of rechargable AAA bateries. Unfortunately, my M260 went into a ""reformating disk"" mode, then a ""rebuilding library"" mode for a couple of hours then DIED. I had used it for aobut 6 hours total. I returned it to the POP and will research iPods!"
4,Good you must upgrade the firmware,"pro: I really like the player...it is cheap, small and easy to load music on...cons:I had to upgrade the firmware to get it to work and when locked think I hear clicking when music is playing."
1,Don't buy this player nor anything from Sandisk,"I was happy with this player in the beginning until I began having problems with some WMA and MP3 files. They just won't play on the device unless I reformat it and copy them back on. Sandisk support always say it's a normal process to reformat a device once in a while. I don't think so! Well, at least not every 2 weeks... Now my warranty is expired since a week and Sandisk completely refuse to exchange it. They just say ""sorry for the inconvenience"". Well, I say ""sorry, but you lost a customer!""Also, be aware that they only support Windows XP under the MTP mode. I tried putting some files on the device using the MSC mode which is compatible with Windows 2000. The device will play the files but when you try to play a complete album, the songs will play them sorted by title instead of track number!"
3,Long and slow,"The book is written very long and very slow to get to the point.It seems that some pages needed to be filled.It ultimatelly get to the point, but could have been better written."
3,Good performance - horrible dusting,Centric makes good performance brakes - but do not use if you have customers wh0 complain about dusting - they make this crazy red dust color
1,No such album,"There is no such album called Misterioso by Rob Mullins. The cover is from ""One Night In Houston"" by Rob Mullins. This is obviously an Amazon problem. If you want to buy this music, get the actual Rob Mullins album called ""One Night In Houston."""
2,Maybe it's just me...,"... but I thought this book was poorly written! Okay, it has a great premise, but that's IT. Seriously, there's hardly ANY character development, and the details aren't very, well, detailed. Okay, I'm only 15, but I've read enough books to know what's good, and what's CRAPPY. When I first read the summary of this book, I thought it would be great. But no, it was not. It was like those cheap books you buy at the grocery store... you know - those dime romances or whatever they're called. So don't waste your money. If you still feel compelled to read it, just check it out from a library."
3,Well Known Story Retold,"The story of star-crossed lovers Tristan and Isolde is widely known; even Wagner wrote an opera based on this love story. Ms. Miles book is light years away from this masterpiece, but of course, we cannot expect everyone to have Wagner's genius!Both Tristan and Isolde are well-developed and likeable characters, but when it comes to the rest, let's call it ""supporting cast"", you are left wanting for more.King Mark and the queen, Isolde's mother, are two-dimensional characters, and even the Priest and Andred, King Mark's nephew and heir apparent to the throne of Cornwall, are lame and not the type of villain one loves to hate.I would have enjoyed less fantasy, and a lot less thinking from the characters.And then, if there would have been less of: ""Oh, Mother, Goddess"""
1,Moronic,"Okay, this story throws in a bunch of Goddess/feminist/mother-rite stuff, but the main female character is nothing more than a stupid girl. To sum up the entire series, she does not care about the land she is ruler of at all. She abandons the land practically and I really can't blame some of the characters for trying to overthrow her. The only way Miles can make any of her female characters seem powerful is to make the men weakminded and half retarded. Tristan is a pansy who happens to be good with a sword. And while Tristan and Isolde is supposed to be set in the dark ages, Miles makes Isolde disgustingly wealthy as far as jewels go. She also makes all Christians look like vindictive zealots. Not to mention that although she is so obsessed with the mother rite and plus she is a princess/queen, she will not stand up to her husband. Don't waste your money on this book about a selfish, stupid young woman who is in love with an equally stupid guy."
4,Well done,"This is the first of the Roslind Miles Tristan and Isolde trilogy. I have read other versions of this legend, and Miles' version is one of the best. She takes her time with the story and attends to the details that enrich it. I am more than ready to read the rest of this trilogy.I especially like the maps and glossary that are included with the novel."
1,Very disappointing,This is not really playable. You get two ships and no pegs to track your hits and misses. The board is very tiny (5x5 pegs) and you reasonably really can only put one of the two ships on the board. I recommend you pass on this one.
2,FOGGING GOGGLES,"Tried them out very disappointed fought fogging all day, switched with a friend she experienced the same problem. Also goggles were too small for my adult normal size head. These could fit a teen."
5,Best Goggles,I bought my first pair of these A Frame googles when I ski raced in high school and college. Twelve years later I finally wore them out and needed new ones. I already owned the changeable lenses so I wanted the same frames. This was exactly what I wanted and it still fits all the lenses I already own. The lenses are easy to pop out and change for day time and night time skiing. I am now a ski coach and instructor and I do not go out without them. They are comfortable to wear. The lens it comes with is perfect for day time skiing.
3,"A soundtrack, yes.","This music is certainly appropriate for a planetarium full of people who wouldn't think twice about the commercial nature of it. For that it deserve three stars. Otherwise, it's nothing spectacularly original or especially beautiful. In simply listening to it, without a space show, I can't help but feel that I am missing something. I was sorely disappointed with this cd. It was recommended to me based on other artists I listen to, but as with most recommendatons, it missed the target."
2,terrible item,terribleit is small and looks so fun but the pieces kept on felling aparttrust me this is a terrible deal :(
1,A Piece of Junk!,After purchasing this item and using it for less than a month all three of the tabs that hold the lid in the pot had broken off. This was normal use only using the coffemaker for an average of three times daily. After using the original for several years one of the tabs had broken and no longer served to hold the lid in place tightly and this was the reason I purchased a new one. This item deserves NO stars but the system won't allow a review without at least one!!!
3,"Not Perfect, but it works.","I was happy to find a replacement for my older Krupps espresso machine. The black plastic lid had melted when it dislodged in my dishwasher many, many years ago. I finally got frustrated with it and searched for a new one. The fit is perfect and the price fair. Yes, as other readers wrote, the little side tabs that secure the lid to the glass cup do break off easily. Even with hand washing, both tabs were gone within a couple of months. So, I now hold my finger on the lid as I pour, but it's become automatic now. I have been pleased with the selection of hard to find items from this company."
5,Very nice Bread Machine BreadBook!!!,"It is a very nice recipe book. Got many, many recipes for your Breadmachine. Some need to be baked in the oven. Some on a pizzastone in the oven. A book I sure will keep forever."
3,Presentation was not what I expected,"The book has a very nice front cover photograph but there is no photos inside to show you the bread types or presentation you're going to bake... I felt very depressed when I had it in my hands. Although the recipes seem easy to make and very well explained, I feel the support of a good photograph is missing !!"
5,These recipes really work! Artisan bread by bread machine.,"When you have exhausted all bread machine recipes, you get bored with the same kind of bread and eventually stop making bread... Well, if that is what's happening to you, try any recipe in this book!I tried several recipes from this book, and they all came out like pro's. Rustic, chewy, and unlike many bread-machine breads, my bread tasted very good even after a few days. The recipes are quite simple, but it is more than measuring ingredients and pressing button. Still, even for a complete beginner (I just got my first machine a couple weeks ago), he/she can enjoy the process and the outcome!Hightly recommended for any level of bakers."
5,Lovely companion to your bread machine,"For those who love to bake (like me) but don't want the mixing, kneading and first rising steps (no time for these with two jobs), this book is a winner. Basic steps are achieved with the dough cycle of the bread machine, then you personalize your loaf by shaping it and baking it in your oven. We all love bakery and restaurant bread, and you CAN have it at home! Best of all, you know what's in it. Whole grains make you smarter and healthier---your family will think you are as divine as the bread you make. Buy this book for great ideas."
4,Well written,"Even though this book says for bread machines...most of the recipes are cooked in the oven. But for the most part...that's okay because the bread is good and excellent in some cases. You do have to watch the dough cycle in your bread machine more than I would have liked....but the authors tell you that. You have to watch for too dry or too wet dough. As a novice I wasn't sure what it should be like, even though the authors tell you. You have to develop a skill for what that's like. I hope to develop more skills to be able to try more of these recipes.Bread machines don't usually produce ""rustic"" types of breads...this is one way to accomplish this."
5,Save money on artisan breads,I like artisan breads but they cost so much. This book helps you make them at home from inexpensive ingredients.
3,Metric measurements make it a little challenging,"I purchased this cookbook for my husband and father-in-law thinking that it would be a great way to create crunchy artisan bread with the ease of a machine.I was unable to preview the book online, so did not know what to expect:- All the recipes are in metric measurements, which means extra time and thought are necessary to convert them before baking.- Most (nearly all) of the recipes require making and storing a sour starter ahead of time, which means they are not so great unless you start the process a day or so ahead of time.- There are no pictures or diagrams to ensure that you are shaping the loaves correctly or that the final product is just right.- There are, however, quite a lot of recipes to choose from and the instructions seem fairly detailed.All in all, I wish I had purchased a different book for both of my bakers."
3,"Nice ideas, but more work needed","On the surface this book provides a multitude of ideas from its enthusiastic authors. Sadly however, the book suffers extensively from contradiction and inconsistency. Points made in the introductory section are not followed through in the recipe section. Particularly confounding are incorrect cross references and mixing of terminology to the point where it becomes very difficult to understand what they're on about!More extensive proof reading and testing of the recipes would have ironed out these problems.If you're experienced in the world of bread baking, then you might still find this book useful from an inspiration point of view. If, however you're looking for recipes which you'll follow to the letter, steer clear of this one: you'll be in for some not-so-pleasant surprises."
4,A very nice gift,"This book contains a facsimile of the hand written draft of the original relativity paper by Albert Einstein. The quality of the facsimile is great, and it is quite interesting to see the corrections made by A.E. to the draft.The paper itself is surprisingly readable as the mathematical notation used is still very much current. Reading the paper requires first-year calculus and physics, so this book is definitely not for everybody.The left side of the page contains a translation in English of the facsimile of the original in German, which appears on the right side of the page."
2,Not that great...,"I found The Enchanted Astrologer to be very ""chance"" driven. You have to pull from a very large paragraph, the answer you want. The chance of finding something related to you on each card is highly likely, so therefore, I feel that its not that accurate. You are also limited to only the answers that are written. Sometimes the cards can be fun and useful, other times you'll feel that its not worth your time."
3,Cute early Jayne Castle(Krentz) work from October 1981,"Hunter Manning has been plotting a revenge on Paul Rylan for destroying his father 14 years ago by a takeover of his father's business. He begins his revenge by trying to seduce Paul's son Eric's new wife in hopes to ruin the marriage. Stacy Rylan, Paul's daughter, offers herself in an immediate marriage to stop the threat. What could be better than turning a Rylan into a loyal Manning! As silly as the plot sounds, it actually works, and the sexist story is fun to read."
3,One screwed up love story,"The Last Circus is definitely one of the more interesting foreign films to come out recently. It takes two clowns and places them on opposing sides of a woman. While one is supposed to be ""happy"" and the other ""sad"", they have much more to their characters than those base states. What plays out is an intense romantic drama that dips into pure insanity before the end.At its core this is a tale of unrequited love. It just happens to be covered in a thick layer of blood, bullets, and madness. While I personally did not fall in love with the film it's clear to me that many will see it as excellent. The cinematography is great, the characters are well-acted, and the tale is compelling.If you're looking for a different kind of drama (with clowns) then try this one out. Just be warned: it's brutal."
1,Not worth seeing,"I wish I could undo my watching of this movie. It felt like it existed for the sake of those making it, not for the audience. So much of the plot advanced illogically. I can tolerate violence in movies. If you want violence that means something, watch Antichrist. I get the feeling that the director simply wanted to shove a large amount of violence perpetrated by clowns into a movie that felt way too long."
1,Terrible,"There's 1 maybe 2 funny parts in this movie so that's why I gave it 1 star instead of just not reviewing it. I'm aware it's not a comedy movie, but thankfully I laughed a couple times because that was it's only redeeming quality. Every character in this movie sucks and is so unlikable I started to not like myself even. For 1/3 of the movie the fat loser clown runs around naked in the woods, so enjoy tasting your own vomit. The movie starts out promising then gets progressively worse until you're too deep in to just shut it off, but trust me... shut if off at your first inclining (you won't regret it).It has an option of watch in an English dubbed version, and has English subtitles so that's nice at least."
4,Clowns SUCK!!!!,"My Score for The Last Circus is a 4 out of 5. This film doesn't hesitate to make you uncomfortable. Then again, that's exactly what you want. Using different avenues, it consistently demonstrates the varying degrees of mental illness lurking beneath humanity itself. At points I watched with my jaw dropped in sheer amazement. The gore level is a gritty 7 out of 10, providing more than enough greyscale to splatter some red on. The violence of both love and hate depicted offer plenty of room for blood and guts. There are points where I wondered if this movie was running long, but it was quick to bring back the excitement til' the very end. Being a Spanish film, it may not be for everyone with its dark and gritty nature, but if you are looking for something out of the ordinary, this is it."
1,fresh out of box and didn't power up,"I got this because I was tired of horrible compatibility of my Netgear WAB102 dual band 802.11a/b access point (Centrino laptop won't transmit data through it and 802.11a doesn't work with WEP enabled). I got the D-Link unit home, pulled it out of the box, plugged in the antenna, and plugged it into the wall... no lights, no ethernet connection, DOA.The specs for range were impressive, but after reading some reviews of compatibility problems, bad support, and having the DOA unit, I don't trust D-Link products any more than my shoddy Netgear.When will the Wi-Fi sticker actually mean the products will interop? As it stands right now it is pretty meaningless. I guess you have to go with the masses and get an ugly and basic (but functional) Linksys."
1,False advertising,"Be careful. This AP in repeater mode does not support WPA only WEP. Dlink support can't get their stories straight. Before purchase, an email inquiry regarding WPA support in repeater mode was answered in the affirmative. Upon receiving and installing the unit in repeater mode, WPA options were greyed out. A subsequent email to Dlink met with a referal to phone support. A phone tech gave me a convoluted explaination why the repeater should work, but soon it became clear to himself that the explaination made little sense so he checked with another person. Finally, he simply said ""It doesn't support WPA in repeater mode, return it to your point of purchase"""
3,Didn't perform as expected,"I purchased this product to extend my present wireless network. I found that (after numerous calls to dLink support) that it would not work in the ""repeater"" mode unless it received at least a 50 percent input power. It therefore was not what I needed to ""extend"" my network to my shop. In the end I used the unit in the ""access point"" mode. That required installing cat-5 cable from my router to the DWL-2100AP. Works great in that configuration."
3,"Does the job, but...","It (or a combination of it and my wireless router) intereferes with bluetooth. Now if I want to use the bluetooth on my phone, I have to unplug all this stuff ;(. VERY ANNOYING!!! Installation took 3 hours with 2 different reps. D-link customer service is outstanding, by the way. Also, my download speed seems to be limited to 75 kbps on the WAP end. Upload is more than double that, which is wierd. Looks like I need another few hours on the phone with tech support.Bottom line...works kinda well when you actually get it set up. However, getting it set up can be an exercise in patience. Expensive for the speeds I'm seeing :("
1,Broken out of the box,"Read all of the negative reviews here and foolishly ignored them. The unit would not connect for configuration, despite being tried on three different systems. I configure WAPs for a living and it was a huge disappointment to have absolutely no response from this unit. Technical support was also worthless and I spent more time educating the agent about the product than he spent addressing any problems. Returned same day as purchase. Avoid this inferior product!"
1,Most miserable experience in computing,"I purchased a DLink networking system last month and I finally gave up and switched to another brand.I was online with their tech for days spanning three weeks of hell. I would spend an hour with a tech only to find out that the access point would not work with my router.I purchased what I thought was the correct access points and stayed online with tech for two days. After two days, they said that this access point would not work with my router.Finally, we were able to key in on the right product and I spent all afternoon and into the night with it. Still would not work.All the PC magazines I have read rated the DLink as the best on the planet. I buy as much as I can with Amazon and just ordered a networking system by Linksys.I hope to God this system works.Never been so miserable in all the years with anything PC related.If you are busy and cannot take the time to be on the phone for three weeks with tech, do not buy Dlink."
1,Does not work as advertised,"The DWL2100AP worked OK as an access point, but does not work as a repeater. Other reviewers suggest that it works only with other D-Link products, because of proprietary protocols. All I know is I wasted a lot of time trying to get it to work as a repeater, and was unsuccessful. I bought a Hawkings repeater, and had it working in 15 minutes. If you need an access point, you can find a cheaper one. If you need a repeater, buy something else."
4,updated firmware,"i've had these access points for about 6 months and i wanted to get them to work, one as a repeater. i could never get them to work even with dlink support. i put them on the shelf and used my old netgear 602 aps. the other day i was on the dlink web sight and downloaded the 2.0 firmware. plugged the access points back in, upgraded them, rebooted them both, and they just worked. all of my settings were saved after the upgrade. they work great. they fixed lots of issues."
5,this is an excellent product,"this access point is very fast, faster than my cable connection. it has a great range and it is very easy to set up, plug and play."
2,Discontinued by d-link,"As of April 2012 there are no instructions, no support, so you better know what you're doing. Check their site to verify."
5,Words do not do this book justice,"Edward Steichen's 1955 exhibition preserved in book form. The Family of Man is a touching, beautiful, horrifying, funny, tragic, poignant collection of photos. Loosely grouped by subject; birth, death, laughter, fear, hunger, the pictures strike us like sudden blows. My father gave me this book when I was fifteen and I must have bought twenty copies since then, presents for people I cared about deeply.I cannot recommend it highly enough."
5,What a way to see the world,"The only thing that could be better than this book would be the actual ""Family of Man"" exhibit. Steichen displays the character and humanity of the world as seen through the lens of some of the most famous (although unknown to the general public) photographers. For the reader\viewer ""Family of Man"" give a humanistic tour of the world while introducing famous photojournalists. If you enjoy getting new perspectives on life and the world in which we live, this book is a must have. The photographs in this book are stunning and capture the subjects naturally, which adds to the feel you get from each. I liked this book because I found myself looking through it over and over again each time discovering something new. You too may discover something - a new outlook, something new about yourself, or maybe something in a photograph that was overlooked."
3,The Nuclear Family,"In American we are centered in our universe. This book, and it's re-printed edition, supposes a scientific norm of ""family"" for the world. This definition hardly fits even today's American culture, let alone today's world culture. While the pictures are beautiful, they can be deceiving and should been seen as an appropiatly dated anthology of 50's ideology of family in light of the threat of nuclear war and Communism. I gave it three stars because it was funny."
3,Good - but...,"I bought this ""Best Of"" selection for one particular song - ""Morning Dance"" that I heard on the radio. The rendition of ""Morning Dance"" included here is a live recording made in 1997, not a studio recording done in 1979. Otherwise, a pleasant selection to listen to, similar to Kenny G. I still wish companies would put ""Original Recording, Original Artist"" on the label. If not, indicate that it is not on the song selection."
4,Not Enough Tracks to be the Very Best Of,"I was expecting more out of this album. There are still many best songs unavailable on this album especially their previously unreleased tracks (then) such as ""Catching The Sun"", ""Old San Juan"", ""Incognito"", ""Shakedown"", ""Mallet Ballet"".I don't know how many more ""Best of"" labels do wee need to get in order to cover for the ""Very Best of"" because some 'best of' have repetitous songs in them.But it's Okay though. Whatever it is, Spyro Gyra is worth listening to. Try downloading ""Florida Straits"" - they are still the best ever. Way to go Spyra!"
4,Fun Sequel,"A year has passed since the events in ""Moonlight Secrets."" The night people are still recovering from the death of one of their own. Jamie's cousin, Dana Fear, arrives in Shadyhigh. Dana is going to finish high school there. And yes, Dana is a descendant of the Fear family.Dana starts hanging out with the night people - a group of teenagers who hang out at 3a.m.. She befriends Nate, who is still getting over Candy's death in ""Moonlight Secrets."" Strange events start to occur, and the body count rises. Is Angelic Fear back from the dead?""Midnight Games"" is a fun, fast-paced sequel. There are more screams and scares than the previous installment. It was clever to bring in Dana Fear, as she is connected to Simon and Angelic Fear. I can't wait to read the final book."
3,Review,It was a decent book good suspense. It started off as a little slow and got faster then went to slow and boring and confusing. It picked up and got to be faster and easier to understand.I'm going to show you a little bit of the book to get you a little taste of it.There were these friends and they heard about this mansion and the family that had lived in the mansion. The family knew all about magic and witchcraft. The wife named Angelica Fear was knew all about witchcraft and had a blue jewel that gave her immortality. So she used it and came back in a body that wasn't hers... It was Jamie's...One day Dana Fear came into the town for the summer to spend with her family and Dana is related to the Fears and Bad things started happening and they all blamed Dana ....so read the rest of the book to find out what happens......it'll blow your mind.
3,Ok but could have been better,It was good but less interesting than its prequel. The characters were well... predictable. The end however was an enjoyable twist
3,The Evil Continues,The horrors continue for the Night People.Jamie's cousin Dana Fear comes to Shadyside to spend her senior year at shadyside high.Yet the Fear name isn't popular at Shadyside and with good reason for the Fears are consider Evil murderers.This proves true with Dana's arrival for evil things start to happen and people are dying.Yet Dana claims she innocent is she?Has Angelica Fear returned?To find out you'll have to read the book
4,Arthur's Truck Adventure,"Great Book! My boys (ages 3 1/2 and 20 months) loves this book! It is a great tool to teach them the alphabet, letter recognition, etc. The only down fall is they use it so much the reuseable stickers are starting to tear and loose their adhesive.Terrific gift item."
2,mediocre,"I've had one about 3 months. It works I guess, but it doesn't do a very good job and you either have to move really really slowly or go over and over and over the same spot. The dirt tray is maybe about the size of two packs of cards side by side, so don't expect much. And the manufacturer never ever ever answers the phone or responds to email. And like the other reviewer, my handle would fall off too... I ended up putting screws through it."
1,WHAT A PIECE OF JUNK! DON'T SPEND YOUR MONEY ON IT!,"I might as well just burned up the money that I spent on this Scunci Sweeper...It is a piece of JUNK! I have to ""hand feed"" it to have it pick anything up, and even then sometimes it won't pick small pieces up even when I put it right in front of it and go over and over and over. And you can't pull back on it while your are vacuuming or everything that it has just picked up comes shooting out... A real nice mess. It does not do edges...at all. It has a tiny little slot to empty, and if you have any kind of fur from a pet that it has picked up you have to reach in the tiny opening and pick it out by hand as the slot hole is so narrow that the fur will not shake out. A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY! DON'T buy it...you are just throwing your money down a rat hole!!! I am thoroughly disgusted with it."
1,Beware of this item,"I have had the sweeper for about 3 weeks now... First the handle keeped falling off..... So I epoxyed it on, worked fine then for a day or so .. now my wife just used it in the hall and it wont shut off... I told her to just let it run down... I should have known for 20 bucks you could not get much... I does pick up great when its working.. but I wont even bother to return it... Just toss it in the trash... just junk... Surprised Amazon lets it to be sold on its site..."
1,junk handle = junk machine,"opened box, assemble product, handle broke, broke visor in the fall, no more scuncii sweeper. No customer service when calling in.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT."
1,Really?,I never get it. I called and emailed but no body could help me! I can't believe that.. my money is gonee!!!
4,Atmospheric.,A well handled account of Dahmer's crimes that is more atmospheric than visually revealing. The actor playing Dahmer becomes more and more acceptable as being him than at first.
2,Such a terrible movie,"Seriously, this movie is awful. The acting is awkward. The filming is low quality. And it is frustratingly inaccurate. Second star is only because it's not so bad if you are looking for something to laugh at."
1,WASTE OF MONEY,I heard the song on Area 33 - sat. radio and bought this cd thinking that would be the track on it - you would think the version that everyone hears would also be on the cd - right - well WRONG!. None of the 5 versions are the one that is being played - and this version was the best one. I think the artist has totally cheated his fans ( former fans). DO NOT BUY THIS - IT IS A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY.
3,Not as good...,"I really like McPhee and her voice, but the songs on this album are not the best ones. Some of them are great!, but some of them are songs that's not easy to remember. So unfortunately I only give this record 3 stars... And I do miss ""Over the rainbow"" on this album... :)"
3,Not what i expected.,"Her cd is not a bad cd. It just seems like I've heard the songs before. Dangerous sounds like Britneys, Toxic, and Home sounds like Christinas, beautiful.I really dislike open toes.Im not your girl, and over it are great, fun songs.In the ballads I felt like she was holding back with her voice, like just a little more power would have made it more emotional and fantastic. She reminds me of Christina A, without the emotion and power."
3,Good album,"Before you get on me for only giving this CD 3 stars, remember that I've been a Kat fan since the top 24 on Idol last season. The CD is good, but isn't what I'd hoped it would be. ""Over It"" is a great, bouncy pop song. But too many songs sound so much like trendy modern R&B that she can't develop her own identity. I wish more songs were like the more old-fashioned ""Not Your Girl."" Kat and her handlers did get a couple of the ballads right: ""Home"" and ""Ordinary World"" show the Kat I loved - they are ballads that aren't bloated like ""My Destiny."" Her voice elevates both ballads. To sum up, Kat could be like Kelly Clarkson - makes a decent first CD, but really breaks free from Idol on the second one."
1,Over-rated!!!,"this girl is seriously over-rated. in all honesty i did not like ONE song on her album. very boring, and shes supposed to be a pop/country singer? haha yeah..."
5,Great CD!,"I'm not a big fan of American Idol and the singers. I like Kelly Clarkson's CDs, but the rest of the Idols just have good SONGS, not whole albums. The only reason I even got this CD was because I liked her voice, but I wasn't expecting much. However, when I listened to the CD, I was instantly hooked. Every song for me is great! Some of the lyrics are a little corny, but the production/beats of the songs and her VOICE are too good to pass up. She sounds great, and I've listened to the CD over and over in my car for 3 weeks straight now! GREAT CD!"
3,"so-so, as you might expect from Idol","The first time I heard Katharine McPhee sing on American Idol, I knew that she had an outstanding talent. Unfortunately, in this album, she sells out to the white-girl hip-hop movement that is creating regurgitated music from samples and high song-writers.There's simply nothing special on this album. From a talent that could have become the next ultra diva, in the footsteps of Celine, Whitney, and the rest, she really disappointed me.Of course, I know that Idol is set up to find people who are easily marketed to 9-11 year-olds (it's a fact, look it up in the music business books), it's sad that someone with true potential like this could be reduced to simply a mediocre release. I hope she fires her producer & starts to find her voice."
2,I don't know.......!!!!!!!,A beautiful girl and a great voice who could ask for more???The material is not only below par but subterranean a HUGE disappointment.And her record company execs are obviously a bunch of slimy idiots because they didn't have the insight to even promote the best songs out of the bunch of trash that was recorded and produced.Katherine take your life/career into your own hands or else you're going to really fail in the long run.
2,Blah,"I am not a fan of Katharine McPhee but I will admit, she has a great voice! Someone let me borrow this CD and I am so glad because I would have wasted my money had I bought it! I thought this CD was to..........loud for Katharine. She is at her best when she is singing soulful music. Somewhere Over the Rainbow was amazing and I don't think anyone will ever top her on this one. Katharine needs to stick to the soft, powerful, soulful songs, maybe then I would buy her CD."
4,A very good debut for Kat!,"I really enjoyed Katharine's debut cd. I also think it was smart her for doing pop songs that people will often listen too on the radio rather than jazz and standards like she did AI, which wouldn't have done well. The best three sings are the first three on the album, ""Love Story"", ""Over It"", and ""Open Toes"". With ""Over It"" debuting at #48 on the Hot 100 and #40 on the Pop 100, it is sure to be a big hit. The other two have alot of potential as well."
4,Enjoyable debut from Katharine.,"I'm not sure where the bad reviews are coming from here..I just bought the CD today, listened to it all the way and I hear many likeable songs and beats. She sounds like a lot of today's popular artists that I love and that is not a bad thing in my book. Ordinary World shows her voice off, Over It and Do What You Do have that smooth R&B flavor, Home is a strong track..Dangerous is my favorite, I have no idea why the dissing on that song because it's really good. I would say Kat did her thing here and this is worth a purchase. Side note: I think this album cover is better than the one that I saw on this site before they changed it, but of course, that's just my opinion."
2,Eeeeeek!,"Katharine needs to write her own music. These songs are shallow and obviously targetted for the younguns! She and Kelly both are wasting beautiful voices and talent on ""hip"" edgy songs. Hopefully, Katharine will discover her depth soon....Good luck, but it's not going to happen with this one."
2,Wouldnt buy this cd til a music change in style,"Better luck next time around wrong songs for her. Lets see some pop,smooth jazz or easy litening songs ones better suited & right for her voice.George"
2,Disappointed,"I voted for Kat but feel that there is nothing on the CD that shows off her talent. She has a great voice and the ability to shine, but it's not shone on this CD. Maybe her next CD will reflect her talent. Her handlers wanted her to appeal to people who listen to generic pop music - and it will. Few idols have been able to escape this pop fate and stay true to their ""soul."" (a few exceptions: Kelly & Clay)."
3,Alright!,"I purchased this cd on January 30th, 2007. I was surprised by a few things with this cd. The cover shot and font used was just awful, the back of the cd with the tracklisting looks like it took 5 minutes to produce. The booklet features no lyrics and a minimal amount of pics. As for the music itself, I think it was an alright cd. I don't think it showed the character Katharine portrayed on AI as the good girl, but still an acceptable cd. With all the issues I had, I would recommend this cd."
3,Katharine is talented,"Katharine is talented, however this CD does not display the true power and beauty of her voice. It is a not bad 1st effort. However, I look forward to the time the true Katharine is allowed to emerge. For pop, it will sell for the younger crowd, but as an oldie, I am looking for more main stream non girl pop music. The CD is entertaining. Worth a buy for the teen crowd"
4,wow,at first i thought ok heres another stupid dirty pop princess. but u know aside from the song being alone she's not that dirty. my favorite song is over it. there are alot of songs titled over it....ashley tisdale annelise van der pol and everlife but this is the best one. it's awesome! she could do a bit better though especially with her album cover:(
2,She can do much better.,I was disappointed in this c.d. She has a beautiful voice. On this c.d. the songs sound alike to me and her voice is not distinctive. I did pass it on to the a family that is a mega fan of hers and they really enjoy it.
4,Good Album,"I bought the Cd because I like the song ""Over It"" when I heard it on AOL first lsten. I didn't know how good the album was going to be until I heard it. Most of her songs are good. The songs are pure pop and r&b, you won't find any hip-hop sound here. I have to admit, when she sings the ballad songs, her voice reminds me of Christina Aguilera. My favorite songs are Over It, Open Toes because it's catchy, Each Other, and Track 12. I didn't give this CD a 4 star because the songs are not spectacular, it's just good. Another thing, if you are looking for a dance CD, this CD is not it. There are probably only 2 songs you can dance to."
3,Kat does Beyonce,"I was bummed that this album was such a copy of Beyonce Knowles style, and overproduced musical backing, that Katharine McPhee's unique abilities sort of get lost in the mix. She has such a rich voice, and I was really looking forward to her bluesy style. This is very commercial and may make her some money, but I feel she sold herself cheaply. It could have been made by anybody with a passable voice and lots of sound backing."
2,material doesn't suit her,"I liked many of Katharine McPhee's song choices on the show but am disappointed with her debut album. She has a beautiful voice but the urban, teenybopper pop music is not the right style for it. She's best singing some standards/adult contemporary type material."
5,Awesome!,"This CD is up there on the best debuts from an American Idol contestant. There is something on there for everyone and I cant get enough of it. Buy it, give it a listen, and you wont be disappointed. Believe me you will be dancing and singing along in no time! I love it!"
3,disappointing,I was very disappointed in this CD from Kat. There were only a couple of songs that I liked and the others were not my kind of music. I was hoping for more song choices like she did on American Idol. I listened to it and gave it away. She however has an awesome voice and this CD does show it.
3,"Not at all what I expected,....","This album is not at all what I expected, but then again, I didn't know what I expected to hear. I surely didn't expect Katherine McPhee to go the pure R&B route. This album is probably pretty good to someone who likes this genre of music, but I don't. I expected more of a straightforward pop album. It has some pop undertones, but it's primarily R&B. As much as I liked Katherine McPhee, I couldn't alter my musical preferences just for her. :)"
3,Just OK,"I really thought Katharine would produce a great CD. She was awsome on American Idol. Sadly, it's just ok."
1,IT STINKS,Good looking lady with decent voice goes into recording studio and churns out a terrible cd.....Weak material equals a stinker.....save your $$$$$
3,GREAT VOICE; SO-SO SONGS,"After watching Katharine McPhee on American Idol, I was eagerly awaiting her solo album. I enjoyed her electic mix of song choices on the show, ranging from ""Over the Rainbow"" to ""Black Horse and Cherry Tree,"" and was anticipating more of the same in her debut album.Sadly, though, this album has mostly the type of mainstream pop you'd expect to hear on albums by Christina Aguilera, Mariah Carey and others. There were a couple of tracks I did enjoy, though, such as ""Home,"" but, for the most part, the bulk of the tunes are forgettable.Thankfully, Katharine has the type of voice that can rise above these songs (she could sing the phone book and make it sound fabulous). I'm hoping that her next album will showcase that voice and the electic mix of songs that endeared her to her fans."
3,:(:(ew...,"Stars are so depressing lately. she is really pretty, she has a good voice, but she likes to wear immodest clothes. 'open toes' is a cute song but with some suggestive themes, like flirting in her miniskirt and putting herself above everything else. 'love story' is a sweet song, but the music video is horrible. And more than gross, it's just plain wierd. Call me conservative, but i don't care for plunging necklines, shortSHORT skirts, and some of the other themes in this album. She sang 'Connected' in Barbie and the Diamond Castle and that's where i heard of her :0)"
5,Amazing!,"I love this album...every song is my favorite!!! The songs have so much meaning behind them, and are so easy to relate to. Amazing vocals!!!!"
3,I have a question,Why did Katharine stop singing songs like Somewhere over the rainbow and why is she sitting like that on the cover of her cd? My sister's babysitter has the cd and I listened to the whole thing but at first I didn't believe her that it was Kat and then she showed me the cover and it was. I liked her better before. :(
4,This is not the music I would have chosen for Katharine.,"I would have liked an album of Broadway and adult contemporary songs because Kat sings them so well. This album has a strong R&B flavor which isn't exactly my favorite genre. Still, what Kat does she does well and for those who are into pop and R&B, they should be satisfied with this effort. Kat's vocals shine on the ballads. They were enough to get me to buy this album In addition, ""Open Toes"" is a catchy tune. I do hope the next album goes in a different direction."
2,McPhee and HipHop,"Album was produced with so much bass you could hardly hear her voice. It sounded like a version of hip-hop. She needs a new producer to present her beautiful voice, Striesand style. Her duet with Bocelli on the ""Hit Man"" was great"
3,Katharine McPhee,"Katharine McPhee has a marvellous persona. Not only can she act, but she can sing really well. She also has a good sense of social responsibility. And that smile! This is a pleasant album by Katharine with a good mix of tunes. My favourites include the up tempo 'Love Story' and 'Over It', but the more melodic tracks such as 'Home', 'Better Off Alone' and my favourite track on the album 'Ordinary World' really allow Katharine's voice to shine. I look forward to following her career. It'll probably be a ""Smash"".Katharine McPhee"
5,Finally - Some VARIETY,"This is the first debut idol CD that actually has REAL variety in the style of music, and pretty much the first idol CD to actually respect - what radio refers to as - rhythm / crossover - if I'm not mistaken.Anyway... Upon first listen or two of this CD, I would've given it a 4 stars rating, but I have since listened to this CD a handful of times, and I tell you, I LOVE IT! This one might end up being my favorite idol CD (knocking out Latoya London - poor Latoya).My favorite tracks are (I'll limit, so's not to track nearly the whole CD)DangerousNeglectedOpen Toes (especially the middle - end - VERY UNEXPECTED)Not Ur GirlOver It (which grew on me).I first heard Over It on AOL months back and was like, ""what the heck is this?"" I wasn't expecting that sound from Kat, but now I adore the single. I don't know how well this CD will do, but I think it's HOT!"
3,Well...,"...I'll give it 3 because I think KM's just a great singer. However, this is a typical pop album produced by a marketing department with no soul, no sense of music. McPhee is a significant talent. Her soulful jazzy voice is nearly completely missing from this album. Only when she slows it down on songs like ""Ordinary World"" does she really have a chance to differentiate herself from the hordes of corporately produced junk singers. For the rare moments that she's able to emerge from the cookie cutter, the album's worth buying. I suspect AI still hasn't learned from its experience. I also suspect that Katherine McPhee next album will be more McPhee and less stiff suits driving the boat."
4,GREAT POP CD,THE ALBUM IS GREAT IT COULD BE EVEN GREATER IF SHE WOULD ONLY WRITE HER OWN SONGS . THOROUGHLY ENJOYED THIS ALBUM . ONE OF THE BEST AMERICAN IDOLS FROM LAST YEAR . [...]
2,False advertising,I'm sure this is a great disc. Unfortunately the picture shows it as a gold K2 recording when it arrived it was the silver version so I sent it back. So just be aware of what your buying and I'm sure you'll be pleased with the content.
1,"An ""unfriendly"" book","My first point is that C takes a lot more time to learn than 24 hours. My second point is that in the book, when it's explaining say how to do a algorithm etc, it only describes the basics and leaves out the much needed in-depth stuff. I don't recommend this book."
5,it has excellent examples of c programs,the book is well arranged in the order of simplicity to complexity. it is very easy to understand. i really enjoy reading the book to improve my programming in c.
4,A good start in programming basics for the |beginner|.,"I got this book free with the Borland compiler and read it concurrently with a second C programming book, ""C By Discovery"" by Foster. Tony Zhang went through the basics in a clear and easy to read manner. However, if you want an in depth intro to C programming, this book is not for you. Try Foster's book, instead. Also, if you have never used a compiler before, the Borland one is for you. It's point and click heaven. It even has an online book that is twice as long as Zhangs'."
2,it is not a complete starter kit,"I bought this book because it marks ""complete starter kit"". However, the first problem for this book is that Mr. Zhang used Visual C++ version 1.5 as a C compiler. I can follow his instruction from his book using TC compiler from CD-ROM. Thus this book is not a ""complete starter kit""."
2,didn't get past the introduction,"I bought this book a few days ago. started reading the intro, noticed a vivid mistake in an example of what the icons were. the author was describing them and accidently reversed two that were being described. they're only icons, but the fact that such an obvious and easily avoidable mistake can show up before page one makes me lose confidence in the authority of the book.another problem I had with was the first C program the book guides you through. it's called ""02L01.c,"" but it doesn't explain why. why such a complicated name? why not ""first.c""? maybe that's a personal pet peeve irreverent to you, but it doesn't make sense to create something like that and not explain its origin.I returned the book and bought ""Absolute Beginner's Guide to C"" by Greg M. Perry. though I haven't gotten far, it seems far less complex and ideal for the ""absolute"" beginner."
2,Worthless CD-ROM & Sloppy Contents,"It's one of the worst C/C++ books I have ever read. The CD-ROM pratically doesn't have anything. The author mainly concentrates on the libarbary of <iostrea.h> which is very unpopular. An very bad chapter on Pointers and Array Sizes. No explanation what's ever on Windows Development and it's published in 1997 and its compiler is one of the worst!!!! TRUST ME, YOU DON'T WANA THE BOOK!!"
3,Could be better,"The compiler is for c++ and the book is for c, make your mind up Mr Zhang. The software is old and date requiring a lot of clicking and hours of frustration. The book is quite clear."
1,where's the #@$%&* appendix?,"I'd give it zero stars if I could. At the end of each chapter it says the answers to the quiz questions and exercises are in Appendix E. Well, where in carnation is Appendix E!?!?!?!? I'd love to see if I'm learning this stuff and check my answers. If you can't put all the content in the book, then what's the use????"
1,The source code is in c and the compiler is c++. Change one,"At first look the book looks great for the beginner. However, the user needs to have first hand knowledge of the use of source code and compling the code. The author needs to give directions to the user."
3,Misleading Title,"24 hours..hmmm, not sure thats very accurate. Maybe to someone familiar with C programming, but if you are a complete 'newbie' to C, you really need to learn the _basics_ before buying this book.There are mixed reviews, but you have to consider what you really want from this book.If you have practiced a bit of C and want to widen your core skills, this is the book for you.I found this book better to use as a reference, rather than a learning source."
2,"Vage, Uninformitive, Badly Writen","I got this book thinking that I could learn c in 24 hours. Instead I got drastically frustrated with it, learned very little, and wound up getting a good book like Teach Yourself Borland C++ Builder in 21 days. Tony should have explained how pointers and references are used in the real world."
1,Disgusting pile of junk,"Bought this 3-hole punch because of the difficult-to-find 11/32 hole size.Frankly, I should have paid attention to the other reviewers opinion!This contraption is a pile of trash. Springs stuck, paper wrinkled because of punch and die excessive tolerances, difficulties to position the paper (sharp edges everywhere), very cheap construction of stamped sheet metal and a miriade of other problems and defects. Very typical of cheap Chinese manufacturing demanded by American companies...Beware of this product."
3,A True Horror Host Movie,"If your like me, you might have seen this film on a Horror Host show of some kind. Not a great film, but, if MST3K was still around, they would have fun with it for sure and so will you. This is truly a B-Movie treasure and recommended for fans of vintage drive-in."
4,Graphic SF Reader,"There is some classic work here, as the team of vampire hunters is working solidly together, and Dracula runs across some powerful antagonists of his own, in the weird Dr Sun, and the powerful sorceror Dr Strange. Rachel Van Helsing, Quincy Harker, Frank Drake and others are still trying to put wooden arrows into him, giving him further problems to deal with, as he runs into more Marvel characters, including the Silver Surfer."
4,Like A Soap Opera,"This was the best of series. I have read the whole series and it was the best. Reading this series was like watching a soap opera. It made up for all of the soap operas I miss during the school year. It was like watching the ""Sweet Valley(Elizabeth)"" version of ""Day's of Our Lives"" or ""Passions"". If you read this book you will definately have to read the last book. You will just have to know what happened. It hooks you just like a soap opera. It is a great read."
