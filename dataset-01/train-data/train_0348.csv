1,Pick a different stroller,"I bought my daughter the ""Little Mommy"" doll and asked relatives to purchase the accessories as gifts at Christmas time. The doll is adorable, but the plastic accessories leave a lot to be desired. The stroller seat is made of stiff plastic, therefore the doll will not stay in the seat unless the velcro straps are fastened. The is a difficult feat for a 1.5-2 year old. To make matters worse, one strap broke about six months after she received it. So now it is pretty much worthless. I have found all of the ""Little Mommy"" products poorly made. She also received the Baby center (it is a diaper changing station/bath/bed/potty/high chair in one). The little booster seat is too small for the doll, making it nearly impossible for my now 2 year old to get the doll in and out of the seat.My advice it to buy the doll and then purchase the Graco products to accompany it."
2,Stroller is way too flimsy,"I purchased this for my 22 month old granddaughter for Xmas along with several other Little Mommy products. Dolls are great;however accessories are not good as I am used to from Fisher-Price. Two year olders tend to put their weight on what they are pushing. Because of this factor, my granddaughter fell over this toy falling forward several times. On the last time, she cut her forehead open. This was the end for us. Do not recomnmend for other parents.d"
3,VERY pricy !,I ordered this Lego pack just because my son really wanted to have it. There was NO description available on the page and I did not know that it's just like other packs which we can buy for much less and there are no special thing about it except being manufactured 6 years ago. Some rare characters are included but that's not worth the price at all. My son is happy to own it but in the mean time he learned that he could buy 10 other packs instead of one.
5,A great biography!,I read this book with the same excitement that I would a... thriller. It is exciting to find out so much about a manwhose music is among America's best! Barbara Heyman has captured thespirit of Samuel Barber's life and compiled it into a readableorganized format. Be sure to read all of the footnotes/endnotes.They contain some of the most wonderful tidbits of information.Authoritative writing!
5,The authoritative biography on Barber,This is the authoritative biography of Barber. Heyman is a first rate scholar and has published an incredibly comprehensive work. It covers every detail of his life. It also corrects several inaccuracies of the previous coveted Nathan Broder publication. (Completion dates of several works that have been researched through his letters.)
5,FANTASTIC book!!!,"I'm currently researching Barber for my Masters Thesis. This is the best book available currently on Barber. The variety of information and sources she offers is excellent. In addition to the biographical information, Heyman presents each of his pieces in reference to certain time periods of his life and goes on to discuss these pieces in depth. An incredibly valuable resource for me and anyone interested in Samuel Barber."
4,Great for infants with dysphsia,Product was recommended to me for my child that was found to have a severe problem with aspiration and required formula thickened to a pudding consistancy. It works great. My only regret is that there isn't an 8 ounce size.
5,Great for Travel!,This is a great product for those with busy travel schedules. I waited until my daughter was already taking food by spoon comfortably before introducing the baby food nurser. It has been great for those long car/airplane trips and when you are not at home and don't want to make a mess. I wouldn't recommend using it to introduce food before your little one is ready. Babies aren't ready for solids until at least 4 months of age. Happy feeding!
5,I've never colored my hair before so I ...,I've never colored my hair before so I wasn't sure how it would turn out. The directions were so easy to follow that even a beginner like me could do it. I loved the way it made my hair look afterward and it didn't make my hair feel slimy or stiff like I thought might happen. Loved this product and so did my husband. I'll buy this whenever I need to cover my roots.
4,I'd buy this again. The directions are easy ...,I'd buy this again. The directions are easy to follow. And I liked the results I received with this hair color. And it leaves your hair soft and shiny.
5,I really liked the color of my hair ...,"I really liked the color of my hair after using Clairol Hydrience Color, but better yet was the toll it didn't take on my hair. Normally, after dying my hair, it loses its luster and takes a few weeks to recuperate. This time, though, I didn't experience that. Another benefit was that the fumes were not too noxious while dying. I recommend it highly."
5,Christmas Prayer is just that... a prayer answered,"I am a huge fan of Aaron Neville and just got back from seeing him perform live in a special holiday concert. His voice is that of an angel. Upon hearing his some of his new Christmas songs performed live, I purchased this CD after the concert. I must tell you that listening to this will really make you reflect on what's important in life. Especially the title track ""Christmas Prayer"". I feel privileged and special to have heard him sing and I am so full of joy after listening to this new CD. Trust me, put this on your Christmas list, and you won't be disappointed. Happy Holidays and I too will say a Christmas prayer. Thank you Mr. Neville for your Christmas gift of song and voice."
5,Wonderful,"Everything from ""Aaron Neville"" is wonderful. His voice is definitely a Blessing from God. Another plus is that he is a great guy and a devoted friend. Pick any of his albums and you will not be disappointed, including this Christmas one, just beautiful."
2,Fell Short,The selections were primarily untraditional arrangements. It did not provide a sense of Christmas.
4,The Last Time I Saw Paris,"Elizabeth Taylor is a bit younger in this movie, with Van Johnson, and Donna Reed. Taylor is a playful young lady, in this end of the war drama who sets her sights on Johnson. They act like life itself is one great big party. Eventually the couple get married and have a child. The party is over at least for Taylor, but Johnson has trouble taking his new responsibilities seriously. This movie has been released previously in much cheaper versions, however Warner Brothers has restored it to its original beauty. The colors and picture quality are breath-taking. If your an Elizabeth Taylor fan, then you definitely want to add this movie to your collection."
1,Incomplete parts provided,"These wheels and brackets are sturdy and all, but the instructions call for six washers and two axle nuts THAT ARE NOT PROVIDED. Perhaps Pyramid assumes that I have those pieces (in the right size) on hand in my toolbox. Well, I don't. They should at least inform what size components are required if not provided."
2,Roman,"Not good product. My daughter ride her bicycle two or three times and one weal became very curved, rubber slip away, outer weal fastening (screw) got lost.Metal by itself is pretty firm, not curved even a bit. That's good but first negative fact eliminates this positive one."
3,Mixed feelings,"Alright, i want to first say that I purchased this CD by mistake. I thought the band was ""All That's Left,"" but I kept the order anyway. I was surprised when I heard the CD. The lyrics are extremely powerful, as with any emo-rock group. However, the songs all sound like they were recorded in the group's basement. There is a lot of echoing, and sometimes the words are hard to hear. Now, I don't know if this was the effect they were going for, but it doesn't quite work for them, in my humble opinion. I haven't listened to the entire CD, so I cannot express my full feelings for the group. But, from what I have heard, it sounds like they need a little work in the studio. I don't recommend rushing out to your local music shop and buying this CD. Maybe you could buy it on accident, like I did."
3,Around the World,Pretty decent album. Always good to support local talent (Florida). I met these guys and they are all humble and put good effort into what they do. Their live performances are solid and in my opinion better than this album.
3,"I agree, the sizing is a bit erratic I guess...","I ordered a size 7 and this isn't a 7, it's some larger size, but otherwise is an attractive ring. It just can't be worn by the person intended unless we pay more $$$ to have it resized. We've ordered at least a half dozen various, other size 7 rings on amazon and other si tes, so I'd have to guess the sizing method for this specific ring isn't the most accurate.It's ended up in the ""pass it on to someone else"" gift pile. As I said, it's a nice ring; if you really like it and want to take your chances, go for it, but realize, there's a chance you won't get the size you're anticipating."
2,disappointed,Simply said the ring fell apart after a month's time. Felt it was poor quality espcially after stones were lost.
3,Very pretty but big and uncomfortable to wear,"I was looking at this ring for quite awhile. When it went on sale, I finally bought it. When it arrived and I took it out of the box, I was very excited - it is beautiful and stones are bright and colorful. But when I tried it on, I was somewhat disappointed. It looks chunky, not feminine at all, although it was right size. I tried it on with the matching bracelet (from Kohls) and matching earrings (from amazon). The flower on the ring is so much bigger than the flowers on the bracelet and earrings. It does not look like a set (I was confident it would). In addition, it is rough on the sides and uncomfortable to wear. I have not decided yet if I am going to keep or return it. Will look at it again tomorrow."
2,stone missing,"Regretfully, the first time I wore this ring was in December, which is beyond the return window. The first time I wore it, I looked down as I was leaving home & noticed there was a stone missing from the setting. The prongs on the ring were not pushed down very well on any of the settings. Once I noticed the missing stone, I adjusted all the other prongs."
3,Multistone Jewelry Fans,"This multistone ring is pretty and I bought it to complete my set. I already have a multistone bracelet, earrings and necklace. It looks fine alone, but when you compare it to other pieces of multistone jewelry, the stones are not as colorful as they appear in the picture. Maybe I just got one that wasn't as colorful because it was on sale. I'm not really sure if these are available as ""seconds"" or not. All I know is that the green and yellow stones are especially hard to see and the other stones shown are much lighter than they appear in this picture. I guess you really do get what you pay for!"
3,Vacation to Croatia,"I bought this book second hand and it was in mint condition. Quite interesting to read, no way to tell if the information is accurate or not, since I haven't gone to Croatia yet."
4,Great Movie!,"This is a great movie! The story line and acting are both good quality, and it's just a fun, heart warming, upbeat and funny story. It's kind of a crack up the way that the actors play off of one another. All time fun movie to watch."
4,A good addition to the series,"I adore this series; indeed, it is one of my all time favorite cozy series ever, as it combines my two loves: Victorian England and a cozy mystery. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the author drops a huge clue - almost a giveaway - in the first few chapters as to who the killer is. In the previous books, I've always been surprised at the killer's identity when it is finally revealed, but in this one, Brightwell practically gave it away fairly early on.Other than that, I enjoyed the book. The staff at Upper Edmonton Gardens have become like family and Brightwell is superb at painting a vivid picture of Victorian England. Even though Luty and Hatchet weren't there, we got to see more of Ruth Cannonberry.Overall, this is a great book that fans of the Mrs. Jeffries series are sure to enjoy."
5,Book,Mrs Jeffries series are excellent!! I just love reading about her. I wish they had all the mysteries in hard cover. Hate to pay for shipping of paperbacks.
3,Short in Theory Description,"Being a graduate student, I don't much like this book. The theory description is not nough, and there're some mistakes in the Matlab programs. For the propose of partice and technique application, this book is not bad, but for those students really want to know much about data analysis, this book is not quite enough."
4,Good Music but Tooooooooo ssssllloooooooow!,"This album is awesome musically and a great acheivement by all the musicians involved but the songs are just too slow. Only three songs 'Wild one', 'Walk on water' and 'Why are they watching me' are what couild be described as 'upbeat'. Every songs is superbly written, all the musicians play very well, Ronnie James Dio is on top form but most of the songs are very slow. If the band were to re-record this album, my advice would be for the band members to drink lots of black coffee and take lots of caffine tablets to speed them up a bit ('I am Cornhol(D)io, I need T(em)P(o) for my (al)bum-hole!' - Sorry I know that was an awful joke but I couldn't resist it.).This is a great album but it is sssssssssssoooooooo ssssssssslllllloooooooowwwwwwww I had to deduct a star. Dio fans and metal fans in general will enjoy this music."
4,if you like RAINBOW you'll like this,"this is a good album. not as heavy as the first two or the stuff w/ SABBATH but a return to the blusier stuff with RAINBOW.EVIL ON QUEEN STREET,WILD ONE,HEY ANGEL,LOCK UP THE WOLVES and MY EYES(which is the classic DIO ballad that seems to be on every album) are a few of my favorites. worth it."
4,Heavy but slow,"I think this album was a start to a string of Dio's albums that were heavy, but slow. After this we had: Strange Highways and Angry Machines. Most of the songs on here are well-written and a few of them are more faster and upbeat. ""Wild One"" and ""Walk On Water"" are more reminiscent of old-school Dio. The title track, in my opinion, is an 8:30 metal treat! I can understand the lower review numbers, it is a slow album. If you liked the rest of Dio's 90s releases, then you will like this."
5,Dio Rocks!,"I like this CD, This Cd isn't played maybe as much over the air, but is hard and great! Lock up the Wolves is a great song and is cool cranked loud! Great CD!"
4,Lock Uo The Wolves,"Not one of my favorite Dio albums, but it is Dio and it will go great with my Dio collection. Thank you for tour fast service."
5,Truly a lost DIO classic,"I can't believe I missed out on this one back in 1990. It is a great album, in fact one of his three best. If stranded on an island with only three DIO cd's, I would take Holy Diver, Last in Line and this one. Yes, I am saying it is better than Sacred Heart.It is better than Dream Evil, too.It's one of Dio's best albums - Robertson plays extremely well and Ronnie is in great form here. the semi-autobiographical lyrics of ""My Eyes"" is worth the price of admission alone.Only one track on this didn't do much for me, but everything else is very worthwhile.Essential DIO, is this!!!"
3,SOUNDS GOOD BUT.............,"The Ronnie's albums are strong, fasters and contains very good vocal sound of Dio, but in that one, the songs are very similars, ""Wild one"" it's the best song of the album, it's faster and the guitar solo it's incredible. It's not a bad album, but the other's Dio albums are better than this one."
2,Not a good album,This album isn't good. It is too slow and bluesy. I think it's much worse than his earlier albums. I wouldn't buy it.
2,Dio's decline,"I was excited to get this CD. I was much pleased with Dio's last album Dream Evil, and judging by the cover art, I was going to enjoy this album. But I should've remembered never to judge a book by its cover. I was actually shocked by Lock Up The Wolves because its so darn SLOW. The only real rocker is Wild One, a good song in its own right. The title track is stomachable but the rest are just forgettable. Only Die-Hard Dio fans should get this, but even die-hard Dio fans, like myself, will be disappointed. I would venture out and say that this is Dio's worst album as a whole, but again that is arguable with any fan."
1,what an awful cd,this is easily the worst cd i ever heard dio sing on.this is a far cry from dio's work with black sabbath and rainbow.is this really the same guy that sang vocal's on sabbath's heaven and hell album.there is not one track on this cd that even comes close to being good.musically it isn't all bad but right when dio open's his mouth the song's are ruined.now don't get me wrong i'm a big dio fan{i loved his sacred heart cd} but his vocals on this album is plainly bad.for new comers to dio i recommend you buy sacred heart or any of his work with black sabbath or rainbow before you buy this sorry excuse of a cd.
4,The Greeks,"This DVD would have been better titled The Athenians as it almost exclusively dealt with Athens. Specifically it centers on several specific Athenians who were influential from the late 6th to the late 5th century B.C. For this period and the individuals highlighted it is fantastic. However, the title is very misleading as the DVD almost completely ignores other Greek cities and periods of Greek history."
4,A useful film,"The Greeks is initially overly dramatic, focusing on one man, but it appears historically accurate and offers some interesting scenes on the whole - useful for high school and college classes.Dr. Roger Peace"
3,"Good Introduction, but...","As a high school English teacher, I find this DVD to be a very good introduction to Greek history. It's basic, and it covers all the ""bases""-art(pottery), literature(Homer), politics(Aristotle), and philosophy(Socrates).However, most of the treatment is a bit too superficial for anybody who already has some familiarity with Greek history."
4,Excellent! but very biased towards Athens and it's history.,Very well done. I enjoyed it as a novice of Greek History. I would very much like to have seen some of the other players in Greek history like the Spartans.
1,Low Budget Pulp,"Lot's of dramatic music, words like ""astounding"", ""astonishing"", ""amazing"" and endless close-up shots of ancient pottery, trees blowing in the wind, armour hanging on walls etc makes this a boring DVD. They obviously had a low budget. The idea of telling the story of the Greeks is good but this DVD doesn't do it any justice. Skip it."
3,Cute storage cabinet,"The shabby chic cabinet looks good from afar and similar to the picture, but it is extremely lightweight and 'delicate'. Prior to opening the package, I thought there was a mistake, as I was able to carry the box practically with one finger. It wasn't the sturdy piece I was expecting, but the dimensions were perfect and I did like the look."
4,"Desolate but Beckoning, Promising Hope","Open the cover of this book and slip into the early part of the past century. A lively 18 year old has adventures no one could quite imagine when she leaves behind her sheltered existence to teach school out in the dust, wind, and sun parched plains of West Texas. For every step taken forward, Lucinda Eliza Richards becomes aware of the detours the must take to get there. Nature and humanity are ruthless and capricious and the plethora of obstacles and hardship is occasionally overwhelming. A very frank and fair look into these lives and times. Well written and honest."
4,The Train to Estelline,"TRAIN TO ESTELLINE is the second Jane Roberts Wood book I read, after A PLACE CALLED SWEET SHRUB. Both are delightful. The letter/diary style of TRAIN chronicles the life of a young woman leaving home to begin her teaching career at the turn of the century. The reader feels like something of a voyeur following events while being privy to the private thoughts of the young woman. It is a charming book which leaves one a little envious of the innocence, the naiveté of Americans living in that period."
4,"Reminds one of the Mitford series, charming and sweet.","In this first book of a trilogy, we are introduced to Lucy Richards, a young girl of 17. Her first job takes her away from her family and friends to a town where she will meet some endearing characters. Written from the point of view of letters home, the book is filled with comedy, tragedy and romance. All in all a very sweet book that reminds one of the Mitford series, but this one's set in the early 1900s in Texas."
2,Disappointing and odd typesetting,"The book was highly recommended to my twelve year old daughter. Because Annie dislike fantasy and science fiction, I purchased the trilogy based on a brief overview. Annie likes adventure, problem solving, and ""chick flicks"" She adored Legally Blonde and I hoped that <The train to Estelline would be a story about a career girl. What we had instead, was a series of thefts, double dealing, prostitution, murder, child abuse, and manipulative people. I don't need a book for this. Our newspapers and country lyrics are filled with the disappointment, heartache, and lowlife depicted in the book. It is a page turner, but for the wrong reason. I read the book to see how the author would write her way back to anything resembling good story telling. It was also very odd the way the typesetter consistently wrote al1 with the numeral one at the end. I classify the book as a less well written Cold Mountain."
1,BEAUTIFUL BUT ONLY LASTED 1 DAY.,"It so happened I clapped my hands together one time on the first occasion that I wore it, and the ring fell off my finger, broken in 3 pieces. :-("
4,"Pretty, but not what I wanted","The ring is beautiful, but very thick and chunky. Not really for a ladies hand at all. I will continue to look for something a little more delicate, and perhaps use this one as a pendant."
3,:-/,"The ring I received matches the color of the picture only in bright light - otherwise it is much darker, almost black at times.While somewhat disappointing, this does make for a very interesting effect when viewed from different angles/under different light."
5,AWESOME!!!,"A fantastic CD. Though I've only played it a couple times, I can tell I'll will ""know"" this CD inside and out before too long. I'm not just playing this CD, I'm listening to it and appreciating all the hard work."
1,Nice but doesn't match other items in collection,This is a very nice soap dispnser but I bought it with the toothbrush holder from the same collection and the oil rub bronze finish is quite different between the 2. Moen said they can not guarrantee any items in the ORB finish will be similar and thats that. Really disappointed because now can not return to amazon as the return window has closed.On a positive note i was able to spray paint these in a nice bronze metallic crom krylon so not all was los
2,Finish comes off in first 4-5 months,"Looks nice and works well. However, the finish on thebronze-colored top around the porcelain base comes off with exposure to soap. It is not a durable finish and won't look nice for very long. I'm going to call Moen and see what they will do."
3,Unique,"This tea is very fresh and is not too fine that it will wash into your cup with normal infusers. This tea's taste is very unique as to the flavor, it tastes like a fermented cucumber mixed with a mild black tea? It's so hard to explain. It's not particularly to my favor. I still have nearly 4 cups left of it on my burner. I tried it with soy milk (lactose intolerant) after trying it plain; I can't quite create a cup to my liking (I will keep trying). The single pack tea bags that came with my purchase from the Davidson's Tea vendor were unexpected and delicious, thus the tea price with the combined fedex shipping was well worth it for the fantastic trial pieces that I plan to purchase in the future."
1,Warning!,"This film blows!If you're looking for a good zombie movie, pass this one up in favor of any Romero film. The plot is non-existant (did the little girl grow up?) and almost nothing the characters do makes any sense. You actually cheer for the monsters in this one, becuase you think it would make the movie shorter if they kill all of the people.Some movies are so bad they become funny, but this isn't in that case here. With inconsistent (ninja?) zombies who like to duke it out and succumb to punches in the stomache (since when do the living dead get boo-boos?)you're sure to regret wasting over an hour of your life.I write this warning becuase fans of the horror and specificly zombie genre are only going to be angry at watching what might have been a halfway decent film with better actors, zombies that behaved like zombies, an actual story instead of none and characters that you kinda understand."
4,Better than Zombie 3,"Some cool deaths espessially the first one (face mutalation ouch) Half decent story, can't complain too much for what it is."
4,Still a good Zombie movie!!,"This is another Zombie movie that i recommend a lot for the Zombie movies fans, It got bad acting, cheese, and some good gore scenes!!..As a die hard Zombie movies fan, I really enjoyed this movie. So, if you liked movies like Burial Ground, Zombi 3, Nightmare City, Zombie Holocaust,.. you will probably like this one...The only bad point is that it could have been a lot gorier, because a lot of Gore in the middle of the movie was cut by the producer before they released the movie because he tought it was too gory (as Claudio say in the interview)So the goriest scenes are just at the very beginning and at the very end..But i'm sure Zombie movies fan enjoyer will find somethings to like in this one..."
2,"Like Zombi 3, just not as entertaining","If you take Zombie 4 for what it is, you will find entertainment in it. It is, of course, a poor Italain gore epic. It portrays poor acting, poor gore effects, poor directing, etc. Muct like Zombi 3, it entertains for all the wrong reasons it was intended for....it makes you laugh. It takes place...oh my goodness....on a tropical island! How original! The dead rise and attack some scientists on the island and then some visitors. The zombies aren't your typical zombies; these ones run, jump, THINK, and use weapons. Again if you take this film for what it is, you will find some entertainment in it. One complaint is that the actual title in the film says just ""After Death"" and the box art says ""Zombie 4: After Death"". I hate when company's release movies like this. Please put the title of the actual movie on the box! No more white lies!"
4,Cheesey Zombie Fun,"I liked this Italian zombie entry. It's a typical plot - a group goes to an island where the dead are rising and get caught in one space trying to fend them off. This is an enjoyable ripoff of Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead, where they get stuck in a house for awhile and keep fending off the dead. I like really good zombie movies like Dawn of the Dead, Zombie, The Beyond and Night of the Living Dead as well as the bad ones like Zombi 3. If you're a zombie aficienado you should enjoy Zombie 4. Gay porn star Jeff Stryker stars. A voodoo priest's girl gets killed and he curses those responsible to have the dead rise from their graves. This is low budget with some decent gore effects. All the zombie cliche's are here."
3,Marvin the Works,"An interesting book to read,but very negative in parts. The best thing to do is see Marvin's films then read about it in the book, so you've already made your own mind up. The book brings across the authors own likes and dislikes about Marvin's films and career,i felt that it was a bit to influenced by his own likes and dislikes. At the end of the day you either like Lee Marvin and his film's or you don't. Personally i love the bloke and enjoy his film's and the many characters that he played. Marvin maybe dead but he'll never be forgotten with the work he left behind for us all to enjoy."
1,"When ""FLAT"" does NOT mean flat.","This ""too good to be true"" deal is.They actually use a regular curved CRT and simply hide it behind a flat piece of glass.If you are looking at a very bright over the whole screen image, it actually looks very nice.But if there are any dark images on the screen you'll get this bizarre halo/ghosting effect.And don't dare try to look at a mostly dark image with any bright images or text ontop of it because the reflections caused by the curved screen behind the front glass will drive you batty.I REALLY wanted to like this monitor because it does have very good resolution for the price, but it is fundamentally flawed by the ghosting/reflections."
5,Tommy is amazing!,He was a young guy when he wrote this album. He's an amazing song writer both lyrically and musically. I highly recommend this CD and all his others!
5,A Masterpiece.,"Tommy Page's song ""I'll be your everything"" is the most wonderfully written love song in history. It has that special magic that no other song on the album has. Noone can sing a love song like Tommy Page. I recommend this CD."
5,Impressive and highly recommended,I first listen to his songs when I was about 14 and till now he's has been a singer I always look up for his debut album. Beautiful voice with a talent to write beautiful songs. He's really remarkable in everyway. Listening to his song has never been bored to me.
1,Dreadful Warbling Voice!,I was listening to Yahoo's music radio and the I Want to be Your Everything song came on. I had to look and see who was singing as it was so horrid! His voice seemed to warble and crack at every turn. I can't believe he is a professional singer. It sounded like one of those dreadful American Idol auditions.
3,"Interesting, but old.","This book provides much information on early exploration. For ventures in the late 19th century and later,it lacks much up-to-date info; e.g.: it ascribes scurvy to salt meat not vitamin C deficiency.Amazon should make clear the original date of publication."
1,Don't waste your money!,"This book is an analysis of a non-sexual folk-lore tale. There is nothing 'erotic' about it. The first chapter is the actual commonly known tale of a miller tricked by a water fairy (nixie)into losing his son to improve his fortune, yadda, yadda, yadda. The rest of the book is a break down of each part of the story as it is 'interpreted' by the author. Very dry, very disappointing. Even the analysis is done poorly. You want decent fairy tale analysis read ""Grimm's grimest fairy tales"", you want erotic...don't read this."
2,review of villa and Zapata,the book itself seems to be well written. the download to my device was flawed. there is a whole section of pictures missing. so the weak rating takes that into account.
4,Great biographical history,"Starting a big book about a subject as complex as the Mexican Revolution can be a chore, but McLynn turns a complex, socio-economic crisis into the tale of two arrogant men. For that reason, his book is priceless. Although reading a biography about Villa and Zapata can realistically just skim the surface of the Revolution, the verve with which thje author tackles his subjects, and the respect he clearly felt for them make his book an enjoyable read. Romanticism does cloud his judgement - although he presents Villa's banditry alongside his derring do - but that makes the book better. He escapes the rigorous pedantry which hangs like a millstone over so much history, but remains accurate.This book is a great start for anyone approaching the Mexican Revolution, and a fascinating comparative biography of two flawed and contradictory characters."
5,"Excellent product, great price","This is a wonderful product for coarse, thin hair especially. I highly recommend. I received it timely and in good shape."
4,Great toy for a long trip!,"We purchased this for a long trip with the kids. We didn't want them spending a 12 day road trip glued to the DVD or Playstation in the back seat and wanted them to see something of the world we were driving thru. This was great. They were able to look for things and the winner got to move to the ""best seat in the house"" at the next restroom stop. It couldn't have been better."
2,"Great Concept, Poor Execution","I bought this for my two girls to keep them busy on long car rides. They absolutely loved the game, and for that reason, I think the concept is fantastic.However, the round magnets used to mark the items you've found/seen are of terribly poor quality and barely stick to the pages. We went over one bump and my youngest child lost close to half her magnets on the floor. We found only two of them (no idea where the other seven went). We're going to end up going to the craft store to buy strong round magnets to stick on the board instead. Unfortunately, that will probably cost me almost as much as replacing the entire game outright. Kind of crappy when my kids only got to use it once.If the magnets were stronger and the pieces would actually stay on the board, I would have given this game five stars."
2,poor quality,"The old adage applies...""You get what you pay for"". The price was good, but the picture of inside (open) of the item did not match the actual wallet I redceived. Inside was not leather as it showed..I was replacing what I ""thought"" was exactly like another I had. Upon side by side comparison the quality and material of this item failed. However, The seller was very prompt in sending and the item was received undamaged. This bargain was NOT a bargain."
3,Big wallet,"This is a very nice ""wallet"" but more like a clutch. It's very big and it's too big for my purse. The fabric is awesome!"
2,slow learner,"It's so big, it's just like the one I bought a the discount store, It's living in a drawer now."
2,My wife hates everything,"My wife complained she needs a new wallet, I research on the internet and purchase this Big Fat Wallet. She says its too big. But before too long it will be full of crap. She likes the smaller wallet but overstuffs it with papers, cards and stuff. Personally as a tool I think this thing has a lot of utility and would rate it 5 stars, but what do I know I'm just a stupid man."
2,I RECEIVED A PATCH-UP WALLET,I DID NOT LIKE the wallet i received. I ordered a BLACK and there was RED STITCHING at the corner of the back compartment where the smaller zipped pocket is located. This is not my first Mundi wallet and so I expecetd BETTER...THIS IS A FAULTY PRODUCT and should not have been passed on to paying consumer.
5,FANTASTIC,"This wallet is AMAZING. I have never written a review before but after owning this wallet for almost a year I can't help but share my joy and satisfaction. The durability is excellent, the capacity meets my needs (I'm one of those fully packed wallets kina gal) and yet it is elegant enough to walk with as a clutch in a semi formal occasion. Don't waste time second guessing... this is a definite must have."
3,Didn't match pictures,"Bought this for my wife. Specifically liked that the pictured wallet had smooth black leather with white stitching that would match her computer bag. The wallet we received did not have white stitching and the leather was an embossed, alligator style instead of smooth. My wife likes the layout and interior space, so she is keeping it, but I was disappointed that it was NOT as pictured. If this wallet had matched the description, the rating would have been a 5."
5,"Mundi Big Fay Flat Wllet,Red","This is a great bilfold.It has a place for everything.I love it,and think every one would be happy with it."
4,Fits all my stuff,"This wallet is really well made. It is pretty big (bigger than I anticipated) so it holds all my ""stuff"". If you don't want a big bulky wallet than this is not for you. Overall I am happy with my purchase."
1,"Cheaply Made, Not Worth It","I had high expectations for this wallet. It appeared to be spacious, and well-made. When I received my package today, I was disappointed. The threading is falling apart at the seams, and you can see jagged edges around the sections that hold pictures. It's as if someone took a scissor and inserted pieces of plastic to make the frames. There's also a black stain inside of the wallet. This wallet is worth $5, and since there's a BIG sign that reads Made In China in the wallet, you would be better off buying a wallet on Canal Street in NYC. I DO NOT recommend purchasing this wallet at all."
1,Cathy,The chemical smell on this wallet's material is awful. I aired it for several days but the odor would not fade. Terrible.
5,excellent wallet,"While this wallet is a bit large, it is perfect for keeping all cards, checkbook, and miscellaneous cards all in one place that is easily accessible. I really like it!"
5,Mundi big fat flap,"I love this wallet. It has room for all of my stuff, it's easy to find everything, and the green is really pretty. The wallet appears to be fine quality and is not showing signs of wear at all. I do think the check book area is a little tight, and the register is hard to write on because it isn't flat like I'm used to. It has the rest of the wallet underneath it. So, I will probably keep that separate, but it's always been separate for me before, so that's no big deal. I like it better that way. I don't have any problems with the size of this wallet. I like that all of my stuff is in one place. My purses are big so the fit is fine. If you like teeny little purses, this may not be the wallet for you. For everyone else, I would highly recommend this wallet."
3,leather wallet,"After 3 weeks, the wallet holds the items I need to carry everywhere which is exactly what I needed- it has plenty of room for everything but my checkbook. I can remove it from its case and load it into one of the pockets, but there is no place to tuck the ledger so it's easy to access. The main thing is that one of the pull tabs has already broken off and the zippers are a little tough to work even when it has very little inside."
5,Great Size to hold all my stuff,"This wallet is well-made and has secure zippered pockets for cash, coins, as well as a generous amount of slots for credit cards, a pen, a clear window pocket for my driver's license, and more. It could accommodate my checkbook too, but I don't varry that with me every day. I have been using it for more than a month and looks great."
3,Mundi Big Fat Wallet,"This wallet carries a lot of stuff, ladies. The best part of it is that you can consolidate all your credit cards, pictures, and paper money/coins with your checkbook. My wife likes that a lot. The downside to this wallet is that it STINKS! It has a heavy smell that is chemical in nature... so watch out for that. We called the company and they said that sometimes the packing does this- i doubt this. I think that it is the black coloring of the wallet or something to do with the leather process. They are sending us another one- which is fine with us... but not sure the result will be different- Good Luck!!"
3,So-So,Convenient compartments. It did not hold up as well as I expected. Tabs pulled off of the zipper. Nice red color.
5,A Great Wallet,This is a replacement for a Mindi Big Fat Wallet that I have used for years. I love it! It holds everything with easy-to-find accessibility. Very organized and well made. I love the bright red - easy to find in any purse. This is a big wallet but it is designed with so many features that you don't need anything else.
4,Compact,"very neat and compact. i really dont need to carry around a bag with me having this purse. it holds my cheque book, all my cards and i can even put pics of my daughter in it :)"
5,What a deal!,"This wallet is everything it is advertised to be, and more. The workmanship is great, the leather is nice and not too thin, and it definitely has plenty of room and slots to hold much more than just your spare change!The best part, though, has got to be the price! It is incredible to be able to purchase a leather wallet of this quality at this price. Even if it only lasts me a year, it will certainly be worth it's cost to me (I've owned leather wallets that have only lasted that long and they were 4 times more expensive than this one).The wallet is definitely BIG, as its name implies. Fortunately, with the large handbags now in vogue, this will not be a problem for most women! I plan on purchasing several more as gifts. Just a great product, all around!"
5,This thing holds it all!,I'm loving this wallet. There is room for everything which has never happened to me before.
5,Very distinctive to load all your things with you all the arrangement,at first NOW ICAN put all things and I'm very glad I found the Men wallet I can Carry All My Stuff in Order. I highly recommend especially holds multiple cards with him every dayThank you
5,The Browne Sisters,"I have all the Browne Sisters' CDs and this one is my favorite. This is the next best thing to getting to see them perform live. They are not typical folk singers - they are actually good! My two favorite tracks are ""Couldn't Have Come at a Better Time"" and ""Back Home in Derry"". This is a great CD!"
5,A terrific handbook for every Access developer!,"These guys know their stuff. First of all the layout is a masterpiece. I don't know if the publisher should be thanked more then the authors. The font styles, size; page design is very pleasing and professional to say the least. The material is presented with a first person view. The ""Event Model"" is broken down so that you really know what happens when you create event driven functions. Coverage of VBA classes is a charm. An entire chapter for printer control is an award winner. I can't sing enough praises of the Access Developer Handbook. Pick up a copy and you'll see for yourself. Note: The book assumes you know some VB or VBA, and a light knowledge of the Access environment.P.S. I only wish that the authors would co-develop a book such as this on MS Visual Foxpro --We desperately need one!"
1,Not an Introduction,I'm sure this is a very insightful essay about a very arcane topic in Existentialism. However it utterly fails as a primer for the whole philosophy. Only seasoned PhD's will get anything out of this book.
2,If I can make it to the end I might feel smarter?!,"I agree with the other 3 reviewers. I picked this book up at my local bookstore and thumbed through it quickly. Seeing pictures I naively assumed it was laid out more like a graphic novel, and thereby an ""easy read"". Not so. I was expecting clear definintions and a buildup of theories and ideas but instead was thrown headfirst into Nazi occupied France and bombarded with seemingly unrelated events and people who I guess are pioneers of this philosophy? As in my title, I think I should feel pretty smart if I can just make it to the end of this book and have a fraction of an understanding of what existentialism is. If not, I'll at least expand my vocabulary use. Unless you are a college graduate, you'll need a dictionary to to follow along with all the verbage, and maybe even wikipedia to lookup all the people referred to so you'll understand how they pertain to the story."
1,Painful,"Please, please if you're considering reading this book.......go to your cupboard and pull out every box of cereal you can find and simply sit down and read the nutritional info for each: the reading will be much more interesting. This book is so incredibly unfocused, rambly and banal that at times I actually thought I might die while reading it!!! Please, someone tell me who edited this book, because he/she deserves to lose their job. This is the first time in my life where I read about a topic and actually felt like, after having read the book, that I knew less about the topic than I did before I ever opened the book. Really, honestly, don't bother."
3,"Good introduction, could be better.","While the comic-strip style of the ""Introducing..."" series can be entertaining and beneficial when it comes to breaking up the monotony of dense philosophy, it also tends to be rather distracting and can make the survey of existentialism (which is complicated enough) even more difficult to understand.I found this volume to be interesting, but it is also not the most clear of the ""Introducing..."" series. If someone would like a quick read that provides the basics of the development of existentialism, I would suggest picking up a copy of this book. It can be read in a matter of a few hours and will provide a sufficient taste of the material which can lead to further research."
2,So much for the Reluctant Dragon,"Mr. O'Brien's treatment of fairy tales, Tolkien and Narnia is interesting and informative. His list of recommended books at the end is very useful. However, he is too rigid in his interpretation of dragons. Dragons are not necessarily symbols of Satan. What about the dragons in the Psalms (in some translations at least) that are exhorted to praise God? It would be unfortunate if children, on Mr. O'Brien's advice, were to be denied the pleasure of reading ""The Reluctant Dragon."" Or Laurence Yep's Chinese-dragon series. Or Patricia C. Wrede's delightful ""Dealing With Dragons"" and its sequels. There is nothing harmful about these books, or about Madeleine L'Engle's, Lloyd Alexander's and Stephen Lawhead's fantasies, all of which celebrate virtue and the victory of good over evil."
4,An outstanding book for homeschooling parents. . .,". . .and other concerned parents who want their children to read good literature.Mr. O'Brien does a great service with this book by demonstrating the secular and pagan influences in much of what passes for children's literature these days. He carefully explains the difference (for Christians) between acceptable and unacceptable fantasy in a clear and cogent manner (and he sets quite a high standard!)Portions of the book could have stood more detailed analysis. I agree with a previous reviewer who suggested that the ""Pern"" series was given short shrift. I also disagree with O'Brien's analysis of C.S. Lewis' ""That Hideous Strength"". But these are minor points.Of special interest to the homeschooler is the detailed appendix which provides literally hundreds of safe and age appropriate titles for readers of all ages.All in all, a remarkable and timely book."
3,Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Dragon,"Much of Mr. O'Brien's book is very interesting, and he is correct that how we use myth and legend reveals a lot about us. I found his comments about the movie ""Dragonheart"" very interesting. He also provides many good recommendations for parents. I depart from his reasoning when he seems to imply that if a dragon or snake is handled as a good character makes a book anti-Christian or anti-God. He seems to feel that snakes and dragons are inherently evil. He even comments negatively on people who keep snakes as pets (not something I want to do, but not because snakes are evil). Creation was made by God and has now fallen. No one part of creation is any worse than any other part (Acts 9: 9 -16). It is man's acts that are evil or good."
5,Best photo editor there is!,"If you do any kind of work with photography or imaging, this is the most essential tool in your toolbox. With nearly endless options, you can extend your creativity to the max, once you figure out how everything works. I would recommend this program to anyone, but only if you want to cough up $550."
1,Photoshop for the consumer?,"This is a very good program in the hands of a photography expert and software guru who has the resources of a company behind him. For the average consumer? I don't think so. For example, try to print a picture from your digital camera. The documentation is inpenetrable and the messages from the program are undocumented and useless. If you want telephone help with this $299 program, that will be another $299 thank you. There is no e-mail support of which I am aware.If you need the ultimate photographic software and you don't care how many dollars you spend or how much time you spend trying to figure out the documention, this is a good program for you."
4,Amazing,"Photoshop 7 is a great program even for amateurs. It is not very user friendly, but there are classes and manuals available to help teach how to use all the amazing features of Photoshop.When I installed the program, it bugged my computer (Windows XP) and I had to uninstall it to make my computer work again. Installing it in safe mode fixed the problem, however. Other than that, the program is definitely worth the money."
5,The right choice,"Well, to start off Photoshop is the best image-editing tool in the business. I learned Photoshop in school and from I can tell you that to purchase Photoshop is worth it. Photoshop is a tool for younger people who know more or less how to use certain tools like maybe some have messed around with Paint on your computer well Photoshop is really an upscale to that a professional tool and really I think it is one of the easiest programs to use. Sure, people say that there are other programs that are better. Well, I have news for them there isn't any better program out there I mean I have Paint Shop Pro 8 the latest version and well it does not even compare one bit to Photoshop. Sure, Photoshop is more expensive, but let me tell you for the price it is worth it."
1,Pirated copy sold to me,Amazon should not sell pirated copys of anything. I bought this in good faith from you and could not access it after installing. called Adobe and they said it was pirated and I could not use it. Spent $189.00. The seller did not respond to my request for my money back through Amazon and Amazon did not help me any also. I called American Express and they said they would ask for a refund. have not heard from them yet but have sent the pirated copy back to the owner with those words written in a sharpie on the disc so he cannot sell it to anyone else. I think that Amazon should be sure that anything sold through them is legal to sell.
1,HORRIBLE! DO NOT ORDER FROM THEM!,HORRIBLE! DO NOT ORDER!!! They took the money out of my account and I never received the product! Can not get into contact with anyone. Bad experience!!!
2,Very good Product but...there is something better,"Ok so i bought this product after being enthralled with v.6 but some thing else caught my eye. Fireworks MX, the wonderful interface of Fireworks MX has me only usig photoshop to export as .pdf, the ability to download ""extentions"" as they are called is amazing it adds new features galore. So if youre considering photoshop go with Firewoks MX its much better"
3,"warm base layer, but odd sizing","This is a well made base layer. The fabric is soft and warm. The construction is somewhat contoured to avoid binding or letting cold air get underneath. The sizing is intentionally wider than many other athletic brands, however. If you are skinny, you will probably have to buy one size smaller to get the chest to fit correctly, but then the length may be too short. If you are not familiar with this brand, try it on before you buy if possible."
3,Necessary for the nature photographer - and horrendously overpriced.,"The Panasonic Lumix cameras don't ship with remote controls. So if you're doing nature or other types of photography where you want as much control over the moment of exposure as possible, you either risk the self-timer or buy this vastly over-priced item.What it boils down to is that if you want a vibration-free exposure at a moment of your choosing (disregarding the inherent delay of the camera) it's the DMW-RSL1 or nothing.At least the product does what it supposed to, even it it is grossly over-priced. I'm sure you could build one yourself for far less, but I haven't been inclined to try to figure out how.Jerry"
3,Great add on to a superb camera....,"The Panasonic Remote DMW-RSL1 is a true value addition to the Lumix FZ200 camera which caters for certain specific requirements. A remote such as this one is of great help for macro pictures where you need to avoid camera shake which results out of pressing the shutter release button and it is also handy for self portraits if you want to control the precise moment at which you want your photos to be taken (with a wire dangling from your hand) without using the built in timers. As for the quality of the product itself, well, it is what one comes to expect from an established brand such as Panasonic especially when you are paying a noticeable amount for it...overall a convenient, useful product that finds a place in fulfilling some of your picture taking requirements."
5,Remote Shutter,"Panasonic remote shutter for Panasonic DSLR Cameras.Model: DMW-RSL1great product, genuine panasonic product!now it's so easy to take pictures from far."
3,Works fine but way overpriced,"Sixty bucks for a switch and five feet of wire? One that doesn't even allow you a ""bulb"" shutter control feature? Come on, Panasonic, that's absurd!"
1,Gee - Lucky Me,"G.T. Water Products, Inc. 157 10-Foot Drain King Hose and Brass Faucet KitBought this hose along with a Drain King to unclog my bathtub drain. Tried to attach hose to water source and discovered that there are NO threads on the end that needs to be attached to the water. Great quality control. I'll bet it where it was made! LOL Will return for refund. Had to go to hardware store for a hose with threads on BOTH ends."
3,"Broke after 4 months, otherwise pretty great","I really liked this headset for the 4 months that it worked. It was comfortable and had excellent sound quality on both ends. The only problem was the wind noise when using the headset outdoors because the mouthpiece picks up sound so well. However, after 4 months the headset developed a very strange glitch--whenever I used it, my phone would hang up on the person I was talking to, put them on hold, redial them on the other line, then hang up on one or both lines. Considering that there are no buttons on the headset, I think this is awfully bizarre. I tried the headset with a motorola v300 and v188 and had the same problem with both. Neither phone has this problem when I don't use the headset, so I concluded that problem was the headset.In spite of this problem, I'm still considering buying another Plantronics headset because most headsets out there have such poor sound quality or such an uncomfortable design that I can't bear to use them at all."
3,I really liked this earbud,"it was useful while driving. However, it snagged on somethingthen snapped! I no longer have this item, was good while it lasted."
2,No wonder this has been discountined,"I'm a creature of habit, so I kept buying this specific earpiece for my cell phone, since I liked the way it was designed. Small, simple, and I didn't have to look like someone from ""Star Trek"" with that dumb thing blinking in my ear. It works well, and has excellent sound quality both for my voice and the earpiece. What I liked is there is this rubber ""hook"" that keeps it in your ear, and is very comfortable. However, every one I've bought (and I've bought a lot of them) has the same problem which is the ""hook"" breaks off no matter how gentle you are with it. So then you have to sort of stick the earpiece in your ear, and hope for the best. For a while they were very cheap so it wasn't that bad, but now they are hard to find. Soon they will all be gone, and I'll have to find something else. So should you."
3,comfortable but no-frills,"Weak rubber is very comfortable on the earlobe. No windscreen on the microphone, so it can be a bit noisy - but at least it's useable. Not high sound quality, but more than sufficient for speech.."
3,"One broken, one working fine","Items were shipped separately. What a waste on postage. The first one received was not as pictures and what I had ordered previously. It was also defective and I returned it. Still waiting for a replacement.Second one received is working great and I love these. I had re-ordered this type, because they are very comfortable and work great for the price and size."
3,"Fits Well, But...","Yes, it fits well. But it seems to have a major flaw: the earpiece cover. It comes with 2 covers and 2 small rubber bands to hold it on. I've found that the rubber band tends to slip off the ear bud and the cover stretches out after repeated reseatings. And if the cover isn't tight, the bud doesn't fit properly in the ear, defeating the purpose of the design."
5,great product,havn't had one issue with this product nor have I had any problems with anything made by Plantronics. great headset.
4,"Comfortable, decent voice quality","I purchased this headset earlier this year to use primarily at home. The design is comfortable for an in-the-ear device, and it stays in place quite well. The speaker sound quality is very good, but the microphone leaves something to be desired. When I use it outside on the street, my friends often cannot hear my voice, and even in a quiet room, people complain that it can be difficult to hear.All in all, a useful headset."
5,Perfectly Plantronics,"I have so dang many headsets at home I could open a store. A friend gave me this one after he listened to me complain about the one I was using. This is the BEST headset out there. The sound quality is superb as is the voice quality (no one even knows I am talking on my cell). And I LOVE the earplug set up! When I finally figured out how to put it on so it would be comfortable I have to say it's so comfortable I forget it's there. I hate to admit it but, I frequently make a fool of myself getting out of my Cruiser then getting my head yanked back into the car because I'm still hooked to the phone. I highly recommend this headset, more so than the one that looks the same but has a short adjustable boom mike. Of course, I am a diehard Plantronics fan. Best quality headsets out there. Can't beat the quality of sound, lack of interference or comfort. Go for it."
2,"Poor voice quality, microphone","While I like the form factor of this device, it has poor voice pick-up. I have an LG VX6000 with voice dial. I cannot voice dial with this headset--the poor voice quality does not allow the phone to recognize my instructions. *In order for a person to hear me clearly, I have to bring the mic over so it's right next to my mouth.Also, the earbud ""bands"" continue to pop off--very poor design. It's fairly comfortable as far as earbuds go, but it's a pretty low-quality device. Skip this and buy something better."
2,Good but..,"This is a wonderful design for your ear, clean sound / snug fit....but the quality seems to be less than desirable; they keep failing, after just a few months. I think the wire is too thin if you wind it up and put it in your pocket too many times it develops a short and starts to cut out. Too bad i love how it works when it works."
1,Do not buy Plasmaglow!!!!,"One of the worst buying experiences in my life. I just burned out my 4th set of bulbs, after buying the original set 7 months ago. I've paid for shipping to and from Plasmaglow each time, filled out the paperwork, and wasted hours and hours mailing them back to Plasmaglow. These bulbs lasted between 3 - 7.5 weeks, not months, not years. 40 years worth of warranty, but I can barely get 40 days worth of life out of them. I am an aircraft mechanic for 24 years, I am installing them correctly, but the filaments keep burning out in the exact same spot. They are deamed faulty by the company, and after I pay shipping both ways, a fill out the paperwork then they'll send me a new set. They refuse to help me, now that I refuse to keep paying their postage! They won't answer my voicemails, emails, etc... This company in horrible, do not deal with them!!"
2,not for me,i think i didnt mean to order this but i listened to it all the way through anyway. i dont know anything else about josh ritter but there isn't too much that separates him from your standard coffee house hanging depressed guitar wielding fella that needs the love of his ex-girlfriend or something. i'll give it a few more spins but i'd like to hear this guy make me feel it without having to listen to the words.
1,"Wow, he ""makes a statement""","I'll admit that I am not the biggest Josh fan, but I do own one of his albums, the other I gave away. Now onto this new one. I just don't get it. It's been done so many times before and so much better. This is a terrible disappointment from a writer and singer who I was expecting much more from. It seems that he's run out of things to say and lost the emotion in his voice to convey even these mundane things. Wish we could be more positive, but this is definitely a case of: Save Your Money."
4,"Black, intelligent and beautiful","i just bought this book about two weeks ago because of the title, and I am impressed at how he writes. Black authors nowadays are shying away from social satire and critique and we are the worse for it. All of it is real safe, but this book takes many chances. Some of the romance pieces are good for reading to your lady after a fight (I know this from personal experience). This is a solid first book."
5,A novel that proves golf and life often mix,"Rick Reilly juggles absurdity and every day realities into a book that you'll never forget whether you're a one handicapper or a muni course hack. Reilly knows he's funny and shows it , but the sentimental parts of the book hit the bottom of the cup as well.If you don't laugh you probably flat-lined weeks ago.There's a good chance you'll cry as well , but laugh and cry is a cliche , and Missing Links doesn't fall victim to the cliche (sand) trap. Highly , highly recommended."
5,The funniest golf book ever.,"This book is hilarous. It is for anyone who wants to take a more light-hearted approach to golf, or for people who need to relax a little."
1,Not as funny as everybody thinks,"I read this book in an hour & don't see what all the fuss was about. You see every joke coming - it's as if each one is picked off a joke factory conveyor belt. Rick Reilly has to be the most over-rated, over-hyped writer in the history of sportswriting. Missing Links made me nostalgic for a time when humor had subtlety and actually made me think."
2,Missing More Than Links,"Wow. I'm really surprised at all the positive reviews of this book. Did we read the same novel? I had to force myself to finish this, and I'm a big Rick Reilly fan. Another page, another recycled joke written a much flatter tone than Reilly normally uses. Maybe if he'd gone with a 3rd person perspective instead of a 1st person I would have been more receptive. As it was, I never really got the sense that this was a real person/character telling this incredibly predictable story. There are some nice touches in this book, notably when he's talking about golfing with his uncle and really developing a passion for the game. But, more than anything, those touches are way too few and far between. Unless I'd recently received some sort of lobotomy, I'd move on to different book."
2,What happened between the hardback and paperback versions?,"The hardback edition of Missing Links is the best novel written about the game of golf. Rick Reilly captures the fun, friends, and atmosphere of the game with amazing clarity. To capture this setting a certain number of off color words are required.Imagine my suprise when I bought the paperback version and found that it had been edited. Now we can ponder the deep literary meaning of the words ""frick"" and ""boink"". Buyer beware! The paperback version is not the same.I have never known of a book to be edited between the hardback and paperback versions. I urge readers to obtain the first edition not this edited watered down version."
5,Must Read for Golfers Who Can Laugh at Themselves,"It's about time someone wrote a book as funny as Caddyshack! That comparison is most obvious after one reads the jacket of Rick Reilly's hilarious look at municipal golf, class envy, and the ecstasy known only to golfers as a good, long, hard driver. Non-golfers can pass on this book. Golfers won't be able to put it down. Witty, sharp, and full of new golf expressions (as if the game needed any more!), this book should not be passed up by any golfer who can at least read on a TV Guide level. Rick, we're anxiously awaiting your sequel!"
5,Surely the best book I've ever read!,"All I can say is that if you are 30 something and play golf with the guys or gals every week, you HAVE to read this book! Not only is this the easiest reading book I've ever put in front of my eyes, it's also the funniest, the wittiest, and the most inspiring story of life I've ever had the pleasure of reading. Thanks Mr. Reilly!!!"
3,even par,"I liked the book. I like Reilly's style, even as it borrows generously from Jim Murray and Dan Jenkins...I thought the characters were overly broadly drawn..having waited tables at a posh CC outside Washington for 7 summers, I can tell you I never ran into anyone like everyone he describes... the first several chapters, Reilly tries too hard... I almost put the book down... you don't need to make a joke every paragraph...once he got into the very appealing story, the writing got a little tighter... i think Reilly is pretty good at exploring what makes us tick and as such shouldn't feel the need to try to make us laugh every few seconds... this isn't a golf book... it's a book about relationships with golf as its cover... well, done, Rick... next time, write less self-consciously..."
1,Missing Substance,"Being an avid golfer and having been employed in the golf world I could not believe how repetitious and boring this book was. I could not finish it, nor could my girlfriend who has the same background as myself and was a reading teacher for 25yrs. There are much better books available and we found this purchase to be a total waste of $."
3,Mixed Feelings . . .,"I loved this book, and I hated it. I'm not a golfer, but Reilly manages to communicate the spirit of the game in such a way that even somebody who doesn't know what a ""balata"" is can understand why people love it. It took me awhile to figure out that this book is not about golf. It's about the importance of relationships and family over the things money can buy. He is really an excellent writer with something to say, and golf is merely his vehicle for doing so.Why did I hate this book? The foul language and crude sexual references were really unnecessary. I found myself wanting to read passages to my wife and children, except I couldn't because of the language. I think the story could have been told just as effectively without it. YMMV."
4,Gollf nuts will love this book,"Good book about the kind of golf most people play- not the exclusive country clubs we see featured in golf magazines, but the run down muni's who could use a few extra groundskeepers, a little more grass on the fairways, and a ball washer or two. Reilly does a first rate job of describing the world of a bunch of blue collar hackers, with all their foibles and eccentricities. The plot is well crafted, too, although maybe a little storybook in the end.The one criticism I have of the book is that while he does a good job of including women and ethnic minorities among the regulars at the muni, he resorts to every cheap stereotype imaginable when it comes to describing a couple of homesexual characters. While a writer wouldn't dare use cliches about women, african-americans, or the disabled for cheap laughs or as plot devices anymore, apparently Mr. Reilly sees nothing harmful in portraying gays as sexually deviant, deceitful, lisping caricatures."
1,Swallow the Olive,"The author comes off like one of those cocktail party bores whose unfunny jokes get increasing painful to listen to. He can't stop, less his audience walks away. Guess what: They will."
1,A Real Snooze,"Occasionally Rick Reilly deigns to actually ""write"" for Sports Illustrated, though usually he seems to toss off the first thing that comes out of his head. Which makes for some pretty uninspired prose. Which is what he seems to have done in this rather flaccid, predictable book. Alas, strings of assembly line one-liners do not make a good read."
4,"What's better than ""Who's your Caddy""?",Lots of insight to the game of golf. Rick has a tremendous sense of humor and it shows itself well in this book.
4,I'm Still laughing,"Great book by a great writer.This book has left me in stiches every time I have read it. I think it could make a great movie, based on its great dialogue and character interaction.If you want to laugh out loud, this is a great book, but it also melds a nice story about love, fun, and redemption nicely."
4,Golf with your friends - that's all that matters,"Rick accomplishes something special here - tells an entertaining story about a group of regular hackers, amongst whom pretty much anyone would be welcome, who play their dog track course and love every minute of it. At the same time, through the characters, he emphasizes that the grass may be greener on the other side, but getting over to the other side may not be worth becoming another person. Can't wait for someone to write a screenplay for this to get the movie out!"
4,"Humorous, yet crude, golf fiction","This is a fun story that pits the slobs against the snobs (ala Caddyshack). I liked it enough that I'm going to read the follow-up novel, Shanks for Nothing.Appropriateness: If you or your child like Reilly's writing in Sports Illustrated, a word of warning, he's writing for a different audience... there is a pretty fair amount of swearing, crude humor, and sex references."
4,easy to use,"1st time treadmill owner, i didn't know what mntc to do so i bought this product. really easy to use and no mess."
3,leaking lube makes mess,The product works well though the bottle of lube had leaked in the packaging.
1,Not worth the money.,Do yourself a favor and buy this locally. The entire bottle of lube had leaked out into the package before it got here. It's not worth $20 for a cheap sponge/stick.
3,Does the job I guess,"I just recently purchased a treadmill for the first time, and it was recommended to me that I wax it every 3 months, not the every 6 months indicated in the manual since I run on it alot.I ordered this wax kit and it received it pretty quickly without any complaints.The instructions were pretty simple to follow, and the actual application of the wax on the ""wand"" and then on the treadmill, in thoery, were fairly simple as well.I only gave the product 3 stars for the following reasons:1. the lube is quite runny and it did drip on things as I maneuvered it onder the treadmill belt.2. the applicator wand is NOT designed for wide treadmill decks (I believe mine is 22"" wide) so it was VERY hard to move the stick up and down the deck because my belt was just slightly wider than the stick. Now only was it difficult to move, the edge of the belt tore my fingers up in the process.In the end, the lube does do it's job, it's just not super easy getting it there if you've got a wide deck."
2,What is this stuff,I have a Sole F 83 treadmill. I am glad to see someone actually found out this is a vegetable oil based product and not silicone. I have never seen their label state what it is. Stay away from this unless you just want the applicator wand which is very helpful. I'm not sure why Sole recommends this product. Their own lube product is silicone based!
3,OK,This is rudimentary cheap lube equipment. The product was shipped on time and came to my home intact and ready to go.
5,Does the job!!,Bought this product and it does what it says. I use this product for maintence on my treadmill. Was very easy to use and has directions as well. No mess! I would recommend this product for anyone looking to maintence their treadmill and not looking for something that is messy in the process! Plus very fast shipping seems like I ordered it and got it the next day!! :)
1,Very disappointing!,"I ordered a copy of this book hoping to discover new information about the PRO that would help me plan my research there. This *very* slim volume barely skims the surface of the topic, and contains much out-of-date information, such as references to the Census Room and St. Catherine's House. At the very least a new edition is called for, and this one should be withdrawn. I think all researchers would be far better served by one of the publications directly from the PRO (such as Jane Cox's 'Never Been here Before?') or the excellent guide to UK research, with vast amounts of information on the PRO, by Mark Herber - 'Ancestral Trails'. Save your money for one of these. My copy of Ms Prowse Reid's volume will be in the mail back to amazon.com in the morning."
2,What a bore,"I am a big figure skating fan. I have read every skating book out there.I thought Katarina's story would be interesting. While not my favorite skater, her background would certainly be worth the read.I was wrong. For one thing, this book seems to be set up in a way where Katarina is giving advice to a fictious up and coming skating star. Never quite sure if this girl actually exists or not.Also, this book is preachy and....boring, boring, boring.Where are the great skating stories, the background info on skating in Germany?What about Katarina's fears and thoughts on life in general.None of this in this book.Skate right by this one."
5,A wonderful read for fans and non-fans alike...,"A book in English from this legendary skater whose celebrity transcends her sport is long overdue, and this one is a most welcome treat. While not strictly autobiographical, it feels like an extended, intimate conversation, and Witt is remarkably candid about her life experiences and opinions. Swift ably captures his co-author's voice, as he has done to great effect in his other works. This is a thoroughly pleasurable read for the skating fan, and should not be missed by anyone who admires strong, independent women."
3,not about writing your will,"I bought the wrong book, so just to let you know: this is not about making those decisions about what to put in your last will and testament. Unless you want to give to charity,of course, this book is about philanthropy."
4,A wonderful documentary series about the 16th President,"This series which originally aired on ABC in 1992 is an excellent documentary about Abraham Lincoln. Using period pictures and the words of Lincoln and his contemporaries, this series produced by the Kunhardt family covers the full span of Lincoln's life, focusing primarily on his Presidency.The only difficulty one might have is that the video often jumps around through Lincoln's life. One moment they are talking about the Emancipation Proclamation and slavery issues and then the video jumps back 5 years to the Lincoln-Douglas Debates.Overall, though, the series is well-produced and has wonderful narration, photography, and includes discussion by Lincoln historian David Herbert Donald."
5,The Man who does it all...,"Jude Cole is an amazing performer. From the first time I heard the first few riffs of ""Baby, It's Tonight"" on the radio, I was in love. _A View From Third Street_ is one of those CDs you will memorize. You will sing along to every verse of every song at the top of your lungs in your car.There is a reason Jude Cole is respected the way he is throughout the musical community. There is a reason why new artists such as Lifehouse are collaborating and recording in his studio. He's a writer, producer, singer, and plays multiple instruments. His work goes greatly underappreciated and under-recognized.Buy this CD -- you won't be disappointed."
5,Jude Cole,Jude Cole is one of the most underated artist of all time. He helps cowrite for Lifehouse. I love the laid back sounds of this artist. Bryan Adams had nothing on him.
4,Great Bar-Band Music!,"Good, down-home American Rock and Roll! This, and all of Jude Cole's albums are good listening music. It's the kind of music one would listen to when tinkering in the garage on their classic car or motorcyle. He has three other great albums and I can't wait for his up and coming new one."
1,"A brief review of ""A View From 3rd Street""","You know how you walk by a creek, see the body of a beaver in the water, and wonder if it's alive? You find a long stick, give the animal a poke, hoping it doesn't jump at you.Imagine a beaver named ""A View From Third Street"". I poked it with a stick, and it merely bobbed.....What were the people who have written reviews of this album listening to? I heard dull arrangements, mediocre singing & songwriting, the same basic boring tempos throughout. There is nothing on this album of interest, or that challenges the listener. Not one track is notable, even in a negative way. This CD defines bland.Please, please spend your money on ANYTHING else."
5,Hot star Hot sound Cool Album,"This CD became one of my favorites from the early 90s. The sound is original, the songs all have serious grove, and there's not a filler song in sight."
4,First Rate Talent on Jude's 3rd Street,"Out of Jude Cole's several solo albums, this was his most consistent and tuneful. Much in tune with the times it was recorded in, Jude was modeled after the likes of Bryan Adams and John Cougar Mellencamp. The great thing is, Jude Cole holds his own as a writer here. The hit single, ""Baby It's Tonight"" was a fresh air blast of radio pop in 1990. Oddly enough, it was the ballads here should have made him a star. In particular, ""Time For Letting Go"" squeaked into the Top 40, but sadly, that was his last near hit.It left several great songs adrift. The Elton John styled ""Compared to Nothing"" has smash ingrained into it, and both ""House Full Of Reasons"" and the rootsy ""Heart Of Blues"" got brushed aside as grunge became the conquering force. But if you miss a finely honed basic pop of the great singer-songwriting variety, find a copy of ""A View From Third Street."""
4,A dying breed,"There are not many musicians left like Larry McKenna. If you like tenor men like Stan Getz, Scott Halimton and Harry Allen, then you will love McKenna. He can swing with the best of them, but he also plays beautiful ballads. His version of ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"", a classic tune that has been recorded hundreds of times, is really outstanding, as is the whole CD-- every tune is well done. This is not challenging music, but it's a joy to listen to and is highly recommended."
3,It's not all there!,"Interestingly enough, I first bought this album on tape in Spain, 1990 just after it first came out. It was a double tape set and contained 30 songs on it. I buy this, it has only 20 songs and 4 questionably translated and sung English versions of songs. Must be the international version?!Despite this, however, Duncan Dhu always produce consistently high quality songs. While nothing may be chart busting, at the same time no song is so terribly questionable. They are such a consistent group in their songwriting, that I know any new albums will be worth the purchase price. Too many artists or groups produce an album with 3 or 4 high quality songs, and the rest not up to the same standard. Not Mikel and Diego.Que pena que no escriben juntos todavia!"
3,Dance with me,I knew what the product was like when I ordered it so there is not much to say. We liked the music from the movie and like it as much on the CD! The only thing I have to say is about the service of Amazone.com.The speed in which I received the product was phenomenal! I barely ordered it when it arrived! That was wonderful!!!!Thank you!!Gitta Arvola
1,Unreliable performance,"I bought the unit less than a year ago [...]. Right from the beginning it had trouble recognizing different discs and would seize when switching between CD and DVD-A for example. The video and sonic performance of the unit are excellent when it is working.Today I tried to open the disc tray and it wouldn't open. I disconnected the power cable to ""reset"" the player as per the manufacturers instructions but I am getting no response. I have a ten year old Sony DVP 7700 that has given me zero problems. The Yamaha is made in China and considering that it is their ""flagship"" player I expected better. Hopefully it is under warranty."
2,Has Tracking Problem,"I just bought Yamaha player for Xmas.It has great sound quality.However, it fails to track some (not all) CDs and makes loud noise as laser pick-up is trying to adjust itself.As the other review indicates, this problem is worse at the beginning of discs and improves for later tracks.Have to take it factory service.Disappointed."
2,universal player? not!,"Yamaha touts this as a universal player however it has a very hard time tracking dvd-rs, SACD and other formats. I hope yamaha has worked out the bugs on the newer dvd-s2700. by the way, my player is back at the repair shop for the 4th time in 3 months. let's hope Yamaha corrects this situation"
2,Audio not sync'd to Video,"I've owned a DVD S2500 since July. Sometime within the last two months the audio and video on commercial DVDs have gone out of sync. This is most noticeble at the start of a disk, but seems to improve later. I don't think that this happened when the player was brand new. I use the HDMI output to a Denon receiver. Looks like I will have to return the player for factory service. I'd be interested to know if anyone else has experienced this problem."
2,Nice but not big enough,"This bag was recommended for a Sony digital camera (DSC v-1), but it is not nearly large enough to hold the compact camera plus the extras (charger, cables and manual). I wanted a compact carrying case, but this is too small to be functional. I do not use it at all and will have to purchase something a bit bigger. Not recommended unless you plan on carring just one thing and no supplies."
3,Nice bag but you need powerful thumbs to open,I had to return the bag because I had the worst time opening it. Otherwise it's nice looking and seems practical inside. Why ruin it with that awful closure?
1,Not for Olympus C-720,"This is the case listed as an accessory for the Olympus C-720. However, the camera does fit in this case."
5,Great value!,"I bought this camera bag based on the customer reviews. I have had it for over two years now and I love it. I can fit my Nikon Coolpics 4500 and the charger with room to spare. However, it is never too big or bulky. I like the divider in the middle and the zippered compartment on the front. I have never had any problems with the quality of the bag or the buckle. Overall, it is a good value."
2,"it's ""okay""",this tiny bag's just okay. it doesn't cost a lot so don't expect much. when you open the bag there's a junky little velcro divider that you can move around to conform to what you want to put in the bag. i yanked it out because my little HP 812 camera didn't fit too well with the divider in there. the picture on this site made me think the bag was going to be bigger. now that i yanked the velcro divider out of the bag i'm afraid the little velcro pieces left behind are going to rub on my camera and possibly scratch it. the bag has no decent room for the battery pack or manuals. bottom line is it's an okay bag that will hold your camera but it's small. samsonite is a good brand and the bag looks nice but i guess i just expected more.
3,Works fine but ear hook self destructs,"This worked pretty well for me as far as making a connection goes, but it fails the test as a usable piece of aparatus because the ear hook is so fragile. I broke both of mine after a few days of not very intensive use. I received a replacement from plantronics but I can see that the plastic is already starting to show stress marks. There is simply too much weight on the plastic peg.The retrofit adapter is not viable for anything other than testing the waters or adding to a fixed phone. To get any advantage from bluetooth you really have to have the bluetooth capable phone. The earpiece works great with my HP iPaq phone.I would look at one of the newer models that has a more robust design."
5,Finally...,"For most of her life my mother suffered from back and neck pain, sometimes at the same time, sometimes separately. There were many surgeries and mostly she just had to lay flat and still. She tried exercise but always seemed to make it worse because no one had done what Suzanne has done here by specifically addressing these 2 key areas of our body.Tracy Piercy, Founder and Author MoneyMinding"
2,Good exercises but disappointing presentation,"I was looking for a DVD that had a lot of the exercises that my chiropractor wanted me to do. I was hoping I could get myself to do them if I could follow it on a DVD. This DVD does have a lot of those exercises but this DVD is so unprofessional I just find it annoying. Having seen that Suzanne Andrews had made so many exercise DVDs I was expecting a very professional and high quality DVD. Especially for the price. It is not. I have exercised to Winsor Pilates and Leslie Sansone and was expecting something of that quality. Instead it seemed like a video made in a basement, with no flow and it is very choppy. I also think she could have put a little more effort into choosing her exercise clothes. Yuck!"
2,"Thorough walkthrough, no color and bad examples","All of the functions of Illustrator are covered here, and they are reasonably well explained. But most of the book is in black and white, and the examples are pretty cheesy. The color insert section is there but it is dedicated to the display of some artists. What's sad is that the art in the insert is far better than what is in the example. I look for a book like this to both teach and inspire. It certainly taught the technique, but didn't inspire with it's form."
1,Nearly unrecognizable!!,"Let me first say that I don't own this recording. I do, however, own multiple excelent recordings of this work and in listening to the samples of this recording on Amazon there are only little bits and pieces of melody that actually exist in the music Bruckner originally composed. MUCH OF THIS MUSIC IN THIS RECORDING WAS NOT COMPOSED BY BRUCKNER AT ALL. Stick with more traditional versions such as those conducted by the likes of Jochum, Karajan, and Wand and listen to the samples first before buying!!!"
5,What do you think?,This book is AWESOME! Not unlike the other Foxtrot books this one has endured several readings on my part and lots of giggles.All of Amend's work is creative and hilarious. Overall: highly recommended
5,A book for a Beek's library,Well written. Has great information and easy to read. Every new beek (bee keeper) should have a copy.
5,Excellent for presenting the realities of beekeeping.,"""Beekeeping - a practical guide"" is is exactly what it says it is. It presents the facts of beekeeping in a way that fascinate you with the wonders of the hobby and mixes in the pitfalls that would, stated alone, send you away disappointed if you are are a beginner like me. By the time you finish reading the book and have weighed all of the information, the truly interested reader will be looking for another book to expand on all of the points Richard Bonney presents and also planning thier first colony. Good Luck."
3,"Good starter book, but lacking detail.","A very good starter book, but still needs more precise detail. For example, warns of swarms and to watch for, but does not say ""what"" to watch for. Assumes reader knows something about bees and their habits. I do not. Am a beginner from the word go, and need more information than this books holds. However, a good addition to the home collection."
4,Good for beginners,"I found Richard Bonney's book to be a great read for those who are interested in getting into beekeeping. The language of the book is clear and effective in communicating what a new keeper can expect to deal with in their first season of beekeeping. The book does not get bogged down in onerus details, but provides an effective general overview."
2,"The first match was awesome, but stop the tape THERE!","All I can say is ""How the hell did this get an average of *****?!?"". Let's look at this PPV logically. The first match was just awesome! Kidman/Misterio v. Raven/Saturn v. Benoit/Malenko? Can you say ""Five Stars"", because I can say ""Six!"". But, if you have any regard for your sanity, stop the tape THERE! I mean they go from 6 of the best wrestlers in North America to Stevie Ray vs. Konnan (2 of the worst). And it's all down hill from there. The main event is Kevin Nash vs. Diamond Dallas Page, with Nash winning the title (because god knows that us wrestling fans wouldn't be able to survive without Diesel as champ!). This PPV took a HUGE step towards the end of WCW. So, I recommend everyone to watch the triple threat tag team opener, but PLEASE stop the tape there! You'll thank me later!"
4,An event that lived up to it's name. A major slamboreeeee!,"What a PPV event. Georgeous George vs. ""Little Natch"" Charles Robinson was the most entertaining match of the night. I was kind disappointed when Kidman, Misterio, and Booker T lost their titles, and Buff Bagwell losing in his U.S. Title shot. When's the last time somebody won a championship on their own?"
2,ONLY *ONE* GOOD SONG ON THIS C.D.,"Well, the C.D., is well, ummm, okay, but there's only *ONE* good song on here: Track #12, Vogue. It has the best beat, lyrics and the best performance on it. The rest ... sounds completely ""WHINEY""! The other songs like, Hanky Panky, Cry Baby, and I'm Going Bananas, sound sooooooooo bad. Other than those ""MINOR"" flaws, Vogue is the only GREAT song on this C.D.. Do NOT bother with the others."
2,Only two good songs,"There are two good songs on this cd: Vogue and Something to Remember. Both can be purchased on other Madonna albums (the Immaculate Collection and Something to Remember - a ballad collection), both of which are much better albums. I would strongly recommend them instead of this seeing as it's her most boring album to date."
2,"Madonna's worst CD, even though I love her, she's a goddess!","Even though Madonna has the most kick @$$ CD's. I feel this was her worst yet. Songs like ""Cry Baby"" and ""I'm Going Bananas"" are just horrible. But, for 40's music i guess it's not that bad. And songs like ""vogue"" and the part two version of the song she does with Warren Baity are great."
5,I'm Breathless,Verry original Madonna album with tunes that remind us of romantic movies from the past. Madonna prooves with this album that she can sing any kind of Music.This album is funny and witty at some times and emotional at others.
3,Mixed Blessings,"The Soundtrack to Dick Tracy is better than the movie that inspired it. The songs are either very good: ""he's a man"", ""sooner or later"", ""something to remember"", ""back in business"", ""hanky panky"" or they're very bad: ""I'm going bananas"", ""now I'm following you 1 & 2"", ""cry baby"". The music is arranged in a big-band 40's style, but, with 90's updating. This was recorded pre-Evita voice training so Madonna's voice is not a great match with the material. But, the presentation is heartfelt, the photos are gorgeous and it includes ""vogue"", which, deservedly, was an international smash that can still get you to preen around like a demented runway model."
4,Ernstanator,This is an incredible sound track by Madonna. For whatever reason it's never been popular/exposed to the public except for the last song Vogue which wasn't even in the movie (Dick Tracy)
4,Different&#65533; But It'll Do,"While for no reason searching through my album collection I found this and popped it in the CD player. Right off the bat, this album has a much different feel and sound than Madonna's previous pop albums. It contains a more mellow, dramatic, dreamy collection of songs - ""Vogue"" is pretty much the only dance tune here. There's light jazz, 40's swing music, soaring ballads, theatrical, and even some campy Cuban (track #4). The best songs here are ""Vogue"" (of course), ""Hanky Panky"" and ""What Can You Lose."" The closing track, the #1 multi-platinum ""Vogue"" makes the CD go out with a boom. Madonna tries her hand at something a bit different, and succeeds in my book!"
3,Eh,"Madonna's 1990 album ""I'm Breathless"" is often considered her worst (for good and bad reasons), but there are a few gems on here. For example, ""Now I'm Following You (Part 2)"", which is a dancified version of the previous track. It's more than a little weird and VERY dated-sounding, but I like it. Other notable songs are ""Hanky Panky"", a somewhat bizarre song about spanking, and the obvious choice, ""Vogue"". However, the rest of the songs range from okay to just plain horrendous, particularly ""I'm Going Bananas"", in which Madonna sings in a high, nasal, Betty Boop-esque tone which is just painful to listen to.My advice is to buy this only if you are a Maddy completist; if not, skip it."
5,"The previous reviewers are ""clueless""","This is a great album! This proves that Madonna actually is a real vocalist. The funny thing is, no one bothered to mention that the majority of all this music is written by Stephen Sondheim. Of course, the reviewing disco divas probably will or do not care! Two thumbs up!"
4,She really is breathless!,"I'm Breathless is a great soundtrack to the film Dick Tracy. Madonna sings her out heart on tracks like Hanky Panky, More, Something to Remember, and Vogue. Madge's voice is so beautiful and strong, who knew she could pull of sexy jazz songs?! Get this oldie but goodie today."
4,Different but still good.,"Basically, whatever Madonna makes, I'll like it. But when I bought this, it did something that no other Madonna album did before, it surprised me. When you listen to some of the songs, you can't even really tell its Madonna singing. She does it so naturally. She sings like she's used to singing with trumpets and pianos in the backgorund instead of keyboards, drums, and other electronic instruments. Then ofcourse, there's Vogue. If I was going to rate each song, this would be the only one to get five stars. What's strange is that its the only song produced by Shep Pettibone, who proves he is one of the best producers Madonna has ever had in her next album, ""Erotica"". Shep makes Patrick Leonard look bad. Just compare I'm Going Bananas to Vogue."
2,Not one of Madonna's best,"Although as a Madonna CD collector it remains one of my least played, I'll go ahead and write a review. Here it is: The one bad thing about pop stars is that they always recycle their sound. Not Madonna. The good thing is is that she took a break and went jazz. Now the album is not 100% jazz, but the music did not quite fit her. I'm sure a lot of Madonna fans may agree with me on this one. Yes, I know she played a lounge singer in Dick Tracy. I'm glad though this caps off with ""Vogue""."
3,Dick Tracy Soundtrack,"I was nine-years-old when the Dick Tracy movie hit theaters in 1990. After seeing the movie, I scored a copy of the soundtrack on tape. Eighteen years later, I found myself wanting to sing along with Madonna's ""More"" lyrics. Favorites from the 12-song CD: Hanky Panky, Cry Baby, More, Now I'm Following You. Would recommend to a serious Madonna fan."
3,"The World Premiere of ""Vogue""","The edit version of Madonna's hit 'Vogue' is the last track on this album. It doesn't quite fit with the rest of the album, which is going for a ""40s lounge singer"" feel. ""Vogue"" was later included on ""The Immaculate Collection"" in its entirety.While this album is weak as a whole, there are some fun songs on it, like ""Hanky Panky"", ""I'm Going Bananas"", ""Now I'm Following You"", and the Oscar winning ""Sooner Or Later""."
3,"It's different, but where's the dance songs!","I like some of the Jazz on this album, like More, Cry Baby and Sooner Or Later. My favourites on this album are Hanky Panky (makes me laugh every time), Back In Buisness and Something To Remember. The worst is I'm Going Bananas! It's awful! But, the song that REALLY is Madonna is Vogue! Now, you can't beat Vogue.... I think that you should buy this album if you like Jazz, not Pop."
5,Something Different From Madonna,"I like every track on this album. It is good to hear Madonna do something like this. It shows off her voice better than do most of her other albums. She really does have an intriguing voice. My favorite track is ""Something To Remember"" but I also like ""He's A Man"" and ""Hanky Panky"". Of course, this is the album that gave the world ""Vogue"". And it does stand the test of time, along with everything else on this album."
2,Way too long for the amount of actual story,"This is the slowest moving horror story I have ever read. It's not that slow to start- the odd things begin fairly early on. But the events drag horribly- much of the book is spent in denial of what is happening. Worse, none of the characters is very likeable. Not that they are dreadful people; they are just people I couldn't care about. Even the protagonist, who I feared for at first, is portrayed too flatly to seem real. One character, who it seems like will be important to the protagonist's development, just disappears halfway through the story and we never know what finally happened to her. The story is frustrating, more than anything. Even the end seems a cheat; a Deus ex machina appears to take care of the monster. Ultimately, it doesn't really, but we're still left to wonder what the Deus ex machina was and why it intervened. This is a poor novel that might have been a good short story or novella."
4,Review of this Book,I read this book a couple of years ago...and yes it is confusioning @ times...I still liked it...But not as scary as I would of liked....More Occult and Astral Projection stuff...But a Mild thumbs up...
4,The inspiration for Captain America,"The Shield was the first patriotic superhero and served as the inspiration for all those that would follow, including the better known Captain America. This ""graphic novel"" collects the Shield's earliest adventures into a single volume. While the Shield may not have had the staying power of Captain America, his adventures are still entertaining. If you are a fan of classic Golden Age comics, you should enjoy this collection."
4,Atonement: The Beautiful Tragedy,"Atonement was one of the first movies in a long time to move me to tears. Keira Knightley and James McAvoy play Cecilia and Robbie, and young couple in love doomed to have their blossoming love torn to shreds because of a misunderstanding. The story is told mostly through the eyes of Briony, an overly imaginative 13-year-old who ruins her sister's life as well as her own because of this misunderstanding.The script to Atonement is fabulous, and all of the characters are cast perfectly. Knightley has definitely showed that she has matured since the awful Pirates movies, and James McAvoy is so devastatingly adorable that you can't NOT love him. the cinematography was outstanding; the whole movie glowed in the typical Joe Wright fashion. I truly believe it should have one best movie the year it came out.My only complaint: the unrealistic idea that such drastic changes occurred over the course of a few hours. Otherwise, the movie was perfection."
3,A slight disappointment-too short of a movie.,I am a huge fan of Keira Knightly in all the Jane Austin movies she has done and I was a little disappointed in the movie - she acted great - just wanted more to see more of the movie.
3,Should have been better,"It is 1935, and wealthy Cecilia Tallis (Keira Knightly) loves Robbie (James McAvoy), the housekeeper's son. A scandalous accusation against him by Cecilia's little sister separates the two lovers. And then, the War begins.I really wanted to like this movie. I'd heard it was a grand love story played out against the agonizing backdrop of World War II. Well, it left me cold. I didn't feel anything for Cecilia or her sister (they both seemed pretty shallow and spoiled to me), and although James McAvoy is handsome and sincere, I didn't know enough about Robbie to care about him. The movie's first third is shown in quick scenes with dialogue that wasn't always easy to understand. It was rather perfunctory and, with no backstory to show how this love developed or what they are like as people, I didn't connect with anyone.The manor house set is lovely, and the war scenes are well-done and suitably grizzly, but the story just didn't pull me in. I was disappointed."
3,can't decide...but this I know...,"I just finished watching the movie and I cannot quite put my finger on how I feel. I expected the movie to be heart wretching, but since I did not connect with any of the characters I found it difficult to have any feelings other than pity. For someone with easy flowing tears like me, this was not up to par.The cinematography and the soundtrack was outstanding though.I am heading out the door to get a copy of the book. Based on the other reviews, maybe the book will be a better representation of its title."
1,Apocaplyse Now redone in WWII?,"I didn't like this movie. It was as interesting as watching paint dry. And the scene that showed them waiting on the beach of Dunkirk - drinking wine, riding on a ferris wheel as artillery rains down around them, just having a great time - What junk! I got the distinct impression that they were trying to remake Apocaplyse Now set in World War II.I gave my copy away to someone who made the mistake of telling me that they liked it."
2,a boring Atonement,"I really wanted to like this film because of the actors involved in it. James McAvoy,who was excellent in ""The Last King of Scotland"" & ""Narnia"", Keira Knightly, and Vanessa Redgrave were the lures here plus the film had received excellent reviews. However, the direction was plodding and that was a big surprise to me because I had liked Joe Wright's direction in the previous film to this, ""Pride & Prejudice"" also with Keira Knightley. Because of this and despite McAvoy's and Redgrave's excellent acting, I felt disengaged from the film. Also Knightley somehow lacks that ""something"" that made the late Audrey Hepburn magnetic and so I felt little of McAvoy's passion for her because of this. So regretfully, 2 stars which means okay but no bonnets for this very over-rated film (check out ""The French Lieutenant's Woman"" for comparison)."
5,Among my favorite films.,"Can't say enough about this film, works on every level, Script, Acting, Cinematography, Sound.Among my favorite films, watched it twice in one sitting, it's that good. The two leads are wonderful.Blu-Ray is excellent."
4,Atonement,We recieved the dvd sooner than the date specified on the recept. It arived in great condition and we enjoyed the movie.
3,"Great Acting,","Great acting by cast members, but the storyline was long and slow..... Basically not my cup of tea!This story can be summed up by betrayal and two people truly in love are unable to be together due to the betrayal. And the betrayer who feels remorseful their entire life finds a way to make atonement for their actions."
1,"Boring, Boring, Boring!!!","I like Keira Knightly and James Macavoy, but they were not in very many scenes together at all. The movie was slow. There was not the romance depicted in the trailers shown. I was very disappointed to say the least. I am surprised that any five stars were given to this uninspiring movie. The only thing I can say is that the cinematography was nice."
1,Passionless and formulaic,"Atonement is a passionless, formulaic movie. One can see the director set out to make something along the lines of ""The English Patient"" or ""Out of Africa""; but sad to say, he has failed miserably. It has all the ingredients of an epic, but no soul. There is no chemistry whatsoever between the lead actors, James McAvoy and Keira Knightley. The war scenes could have been lifted from any other big-budget movie, complete with violins weeping in the background and all. The acting by Saoirse Ronan, who plays the 12 year old Briony Tallis, is very convincing and, to some extent, so is James McAvoy's. But the rest of the cast (not including Vanessa Redgrave) ought to enrol for acting classes."
2,A waste of time,"A relatively uneventful and unrewarding and pointless film with little romance, and not even any battle scenes."
2,unsatisfying,"I expected to love this movie. Kiera Knightley, James McAvoy, and Saoirse Ronan? 7 Best Picture nominations? It must be good. But it wasn't. The acting was good, it was interesting at times and picturesque, but it just wasn't that good a story, and it certainly didn't have a happy...or satisfying ending.Unlike other reviewers, I liked Briony Tallis, at least as a young girl. Cecilia Tallis was the one I didn't care for. She was the epitome of a spoiled rich young woman.The discovery near the end of the film of the true identity of the ""rapist"" was a very interesting twist, but nothing else about the story was memorable."
1,really baaaaaaad movie,"I was relly exaited to see atonement unforchenitly it was one of the worst moviesI have ever seen, I serisly did not no why this movie got so many awords or thatpeople even liked it the story wos bad and hard to see, I mean this girl made up alie that tour them apart tha she even had a crush on him or or that she even seenthem make love it was sad movie to wittnesss,but its only my openin, it wos dom."
1,Ridiculous coincidences,"This movie has so many ridiculous coincidences going on (imagine everytime you do something in private, someone is peeping in on you), it's impossible to take it seriously for one minute. A horrible adaptation of an overated book."
1,One of the Worst Movies I Have Ever Seen!!,I saw this movie the year it won the Oscar and I was bored beyond belief. The movie goes from child erotic/peeping-tom/I am gonna watch my sister get boinked/OMG! This movie has a great cast but the story is so chaotically told and disjointed you lose focus and interest almost from the get-go.
4,Atonement,"I read the book Atonement before I saw the movie so I understood what was happening. The director would show the scene from the viewpoint of Briony, the main character, and then from how it really happened. Had I not known that, I would have been puzzled for the first part of the movie. Since I understood that, it was easy to continue to watch the story develop. The movie was true to the book in almost every detail and I truly enjoyed watching it. The acting was well done, the storyline great and it was well worth the investment. This is an excellent movie to add to ones video collection."
3,Wife dragged me to see this and it was worth the watching. Weep Worthy.,"My wife read the novel and while she liked the story she did not like the writing style.I gotta admit that the dream like war scenes where nothing really happens helped to add a lot of gravitas to this one for me. The chaos on the beach at Dunkirk, the hospital and bunker/tube scenes were really quite powerful.I felt a little lost with all the flash backs showing what was thought to have happened and what had happened. The ending did wrap things up so you understood what was real and imagined but folks with less in the attention span department will likely come away confused.CONCLUSION, TEAR JERKER! Several well crafted scenes had the gals crying and I got to admit that they were sad to see at a high end level. All in all if you gotta get dragged to this by your gal and you have half a brain, then it won't be torture."
5,A very special film,"I agree with Jean, and will certainly be buying this on Blu-ray when it comes out. The movie was original, surprising (both in its plot and its unusual structure) and moving. It's worth seeing it just for the 5 1/2 minute steadicam shot halfway through the movie on the beach at Dunkirk. I just learned from an interview with the screenwriter that it was shot that way for budgetary reasons, but it's a superb example of a happy ""accident"" becoming cinematic art. Performances and technical credits are all top notch. See it!"
4,Ahhhh great movie,"Not what I expected, very well done. It is a must see, expected a romance and got a family drama and war flick all in one."
3,Atonement Review,"I ordered this movie as I am a fan of Kiera Knightly. She played the role in the same manner all her other films and fit the role adequately. The dialogue is sometimes hard to understand partly because of the English accent which is to be expected. It is a depressing story at every turn. Overall, it simply did not entertain as much as other movies starring K.K."
4,Almost a 5 star,"I felt this movie stayed as true to the original novel as it could. The book was beautiful and upsetting and so too was the movie. I didn't like the ""false"" ending of Robbie and Cecelia on the beach because I think it gave a too optimistic and happy ending. The tragedy of the story is that they NEVER got their chance together, that Briony made their homecoming up. The story is heartwrenching but I think that is one of the reasons the book is unforgettable. Also, for some of the viewers that didn't like the slow pace of the movie, I think if you read the book you would understand that it was a part of the story. As a stand alone movie it may not be a typical love story but as a representation of McEwan's novel it did a great job."
2,Tedious!,"I read a lot of great things about this movie, and I'm a big fan of Keira Knightly...but I'm really sorry I bought this DVD! Tedious, slow, ""like watching paint dry""! I really think the movie insults the average viewer's inteligence - it's all SO predictable! I guess this is my ""counter balance"" for ""The English Patient"" - a movie in the same vein - but one that I thought was absolutely brilliant (while I know that quite a few people found it ""tedious"" and ""plodding""). This movie just wasn't my cup of tea - I was bored absolutely silly with it!"
2,Not worth the price of admission. Very disappointing.,"Atonement starts promisingly and then dramatically declines. I felt the acting was fine...the location and cinematography were interesting...the story was imaginative and somewhat believable...but, I am just not into artsy period pieces. The flashbacks and flash-sideways coupled with the slow pace of the movie just didn't hold my interest. I was hoping for a little more action and this movie just crept by at a snails pace.Critics give this one rave reviews and I have heard Oscar rumors...but, as far as I am concerned...It is a rainy day rental at best."
1,Awful,"Awful. I wanted to shut the movie off in the first 15 minutes. But, I suffered through it. I have NO IDEA why this movie was even nominated for any award. I love period pieces and, still yet, could not watch it just for the scenery. The music was completely annoying with the typing brought into it. And where is the ""Atonement."" And when I kept hearing ""come back to me"" I thought I've heard that before with ""Cold Mountain"" couldn't they have been more creative knowing ""Cold Mountain"" used that phrase to identify to the movie ?????? It could have been so much better. Lot's and lots of unnecessary scenes and not enough scenes to see chemistry between the two loves."
1,NOT Oscar worthy,This is my first review because I felt compelled to disagree strongly with the majority of reviews. I agree with Doug Anderson: weak characters and weak story. If it were edited down about 20 minutes and we CARED more for the characters I could agree with the 4 stars rating.
1,bad bad bad,its a disgusting movie.. i kept waiting to find something interesting in the movie but NO it just got worse. very boring and a total waste of time.
3,A BIT DRAWN OUT,I HAD HIGH EXPECTATIONS BUT FOUND IT TOO DRAMATIC AND SURREAL AND NOT WORTH THE SIT THROUGH TO GET TO THE END!I WILL READ MORE REVIEWS AND LISTEN TO THEM NEXT TIME.
4,A film worth seeing,"This movie starts to my mind in a slow and confusing way. But it gets better as it goes along. And in fact its most powerful segment is the final one in which we see as an elderly woman the child- writer- sinner retell what has happened in a surprising and moving way.At the heart of the movie is a false accusation which ruins two lives and makes the romantic love - story also at its center- more poignant, wrenching and dramatic.At one point in the movie the hero struggles to be evacuated from Dunkirk and there is a vivid picture of the chaotic elements of the great historical event.I do not go to the movies much any more and I am not a great maven of them. My judgment for what it is worth is that this is a film worth seeing."
3,Good...but not great...,"This is a good interpretation of Ian McEwan's novel. I liked it...but I didn't love it. It's usually a bad sign when you think: ""It took me less time to read the book than it does to watch the movie. There are many good things about the movie - especially the acting. Kiera Knightly is fine and James McAvoy is fast becoming one of my favorite new actors.And yet...Part of the problem is with Briony. The actress who plays her as a young girl is fine, but for some reason the filmmakers felt the need to give her some apparent sexual hang-ups in order to give an (unsatisfactory) motivation. The actress who plays Briony as a young woman comes across as a cipher.As I intimated, there was also a problem with the pacing. Events are dealt with in a more heavy-handed way in the book than in the movie. The book was about the problems of perception, but the movie seems to sidestep this - implying that Briony knew the truth all along."
3,overrated,"Just overrated, gave it three stars. Kind of boring. I was looking for a romance movie and this was not it."
4,a cinematic journey of deep and profound experience,"a carefully choreographed visual and auditory spectacle that cuts into the heart of human emotions . . . emotions articulated in chords -- piquant, furry, soft, loud -- all at once . . ."
4,The erroneous accusations of a young British girl on the eve of WWII set the stage for tragedy,"A bright and observant young girl, 13 year-old Briony Tallis, sees and puts together events that have escaped the notice of her elders. Unfortunately, however, young Briony makes the fatal mistake of misconstruing events and accusing her older sister's well-meaning boyfriend of a horrible crime! Adding to the drama of these events is England's brave fight against the Nazis in the early days of World War II, and the differences of class that complicate the tragic romance of Briony's sister and the maligned boyfriend who is also the son of one of the servants of the aristocratic Tallis family."
5,Sneaks up on you,"Honestly, for about half the picture I was annoyed with the pacing and the time jumping. But boy, does Atonement have one heck of a pay off. In the end, I was more than a little choked up. Knightley and Mcavoy are perfectly cast and Saoirse Ronan is a budding star if ever there was one. IMHO, Director Joe Wright is more to be commended than screen writer Christopher Wright for this piece. I think he took some bold risks that truly don't pay off until the end. Highly, highly recommended."
5,Atonement - movie,This movie is stunning. It's amazing to see how something can be miscontrued and turn peoples lives upside down.
4,The high cost of lies,"Cecilia Tallis is the elder daughter of a wealthy Englishman in the 1930's. She finds herself irresistably drawn to Robbie Turner, the housekeeper's son whom her father supports. Her little sister Briony has a girlish crush on Robbie and she spies on Robbie and her sister and lies about their relationship. Her lies have far-reaching consequences and throughout her adult life she seeks to make atonement for her misdeeds. This is a beautiful film, wonderfully acted, which truly does justice to the novel upon which it is based."
4,I must have seen a different movie...,"I'm really surprised this movie is getting so many bad comments. Maybe it's the difference between seeing it with certain expectations and seeing it (as I did) knowing practically nothing about the plot. I found it fascinating, romantic, visually stunning, well acted, and, yes, tragic. It might be a bit long, but I wouldn't trim very much. Not everything has to be wrapped up in a neat bow in 90 minutes.I suspect some are annoyed or offended that the movie doesn't have a typical Hollywood happy ending and Briony doesn't truly atone and make amends for the lives she ruined. But that's the point, isn't it? We all have to be careful what we say and do because some things simply cannot be fixed."
2,Beautifully photographed but overrated,"Gorgeous photography, but the story really drags. Let's face it - this is a women's movie. Huge amounts of time wasted on sisterhood themes - jealousies and snooping and deception between Cecelia and Brioni. Robbie just exudes sensitivity - he goes to war and doesn't seem to fight at all - he just sniffles and cries and longs for Cecelia. Particularly annoying is time-shifting, which seems to be in vogue today. The story jumps back and forth for no particular purpose and sometimes events are changed. Confusing affectation."
2,No English Patient,"Now and again British cinema gets overestimated and this is one of those sad events. It maybe that the pairing of James McAvoy and Keira Knightley does showcase some serious talent but it is still a far cry from the Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet type publicity it got.We will be hard pressed to find such an original script that attempts romance, sexual deviance, war time shock surgery and delusions but after seeing it on the screen one can't help but feel that such concoctions end up mixing like coke and Alka-Seltzer, fizzing instead of sparkling, the acting is on par as is the lush cinematography, but direction and story leave pollution where sweetness should have been. We don't mind sad stories, but aberrations like this make storytelling pointless and blunt. Very dissatisfying."
3,Best Library Sex Scene Ever!,"""Atonement"" is a beautiful piece of filmmaking, from the cinematography to the sets and dress. And the story has all of the key elements of a great period romance: young love, betrayal, lies, mixed emotions, and sex in a library. Unfortunately, the characters aren't fleshed out much beyond their usefulness to the plot, so the ""tear-jerking"" aspect is somewhat diminished. Perhaps readers of the novel will appreciate the film on another level."
1,What Atonement???,The Oscar nominations are getting worse and worse every year. Who are these people. This is an awful movie from beginning to end. It is a shame because the actors are superb in their field. The story may have been great as a book but the movie version is disgusting. Don't expect ANY of the romantic scenes they made into trailors for this movie. It is all twisted. I can't recommend this movie to anyone!
1,no star revuiew,Twice I have ordered this movie and twice the order has been cancelled well after the order. The latest order was cancelled over a month after the order. This kind of service does not rate any star.
1,Horrible movie!!,"I don't even know what to say about this movie. It was shallow, dark, and without any kind of a silver lining. Keira Knightley can't act, which one could gather from watching ""Pride and Prejudice"". There was nothing in regards to any good conversation. It wasn't really a love story; it was a lust story. Ugh...I won't watch it ever again!!"
1,"Depressing, depressing and SLOW!","I can't believe that this movie was so highly rated. The ending was just plain miserable. I'll never get those hours back and I'm still angry that I ended up getting this movie. Most of the scenes were just plain SLOW. Felt like an eternity to get to the really poopy ending and the ride wasn't fun along the way. Costumes were OK, but the waify stuff they put on that twiggy Kiera was just plain bad. Guess it was easy to show off her really flat chest that way. Will someone throw that girl a Cheeseburger or something??? Just take her out back and feed her!For a really crappy evening, watch this turkey!"
2,Disappointment,"Couldn't understand what the British actors were saying and it jumped from one year to the next with no explanation. I had high hopes, but thought it was very mediocre."
2,The British Don't Know English,"I want to believe that I have a top of the line entertainment equipment. I guess I don't because the sound quality in this movie was crap. Every time the actors began to speak I had to raise the volume and try to comprehend their english. The whole movie I was rewinding trying make out what they were muttering. But the funniest thing is that every time the actors would stop speaking and the dramatic background music started, it would be so loud that I would turn the sound off. I want to believe that this was a great movie and wonderfully well directed and edited but I can't. I officailly declare this movie the worst...!!!!"
5,A Classic.,"King Diamond's album ABIGAIL is perhaps his finest moment. It is without a doubt his most musically diverse. There are soft songs, harsh songs, scary songs, beautiful songs. It's all here within this album, waiting for you to devour.But, it is not the songs themselves that draw you into this masterpiece of metal music, it is the story that they tell.Abigail was deemed a classic before it even became popular, it's future was fortold before it even had a future. Metalheads around the world who had not heard of King Diamond's previous band Mercyful Fate purchased the album after reading the reviews. It became an instand classic.Even today, years after it's initial release, Abigail remains one of the best TRUE black metal albums in the history of the genre.I make this kind of music for a living, and I know the good from the bad. This is the Best that there is."
3,This Album Is Worth A Listen.,"I've never been disappointed in Abigail ever since I purchased it a few years ago. It's not one of my favorite albums, but I still have quite a bit of respect for the songs, vocals, and musicianship contained on it. Compared to the other concept albums of King Diamond, I actually tried to understand the lyrics and story behind this album. The guitar playing on this album is better-than-average. Andy La Rocque is one of the better guitarists that I've ever. He's very good, but I also think that he's always been underrated and overlooked though. King Diamond also does well with the vocals. His vocals are very multi-faceted. His singing at different pitches has always been different and interesting. Best songs are ""The Family Ghost"" and ""The Black Horseman."" I think that ""The Family Ghost"" was the first song I heard from him back in '87. Abigail is worth a listen."
5,Great album,"This is a true piece of metal history. Maybe this is Kings most famous album, and the greatest too probably. The album starts out with killertracks like arrival, a mansion in darkness (which i totally love the opening riff in) and the family ghost. The others songs are great too, but not as good as the three first ones. Nothing you really can complain about here. Buy it today."
5,No point in saying anything....,"The complete review I would have wrote was summed up word for shining word by the top review from the Maryland, USA gentleman."
4,Pretty good...,"I've been a Priest fan and a megadeth fan for about 5 years now. But KD have a sound all to their own. With Diamonds vocals, he has a range that go to the halford style high, but can then go into a Mustain growl, so its pretty versatile. If your just getting in to metal, or if your a die hard fan, this is for you."
3,Not as good as Mercyful Fate,This album is good but its not as good as Mercyful Fate's Melissa or Dont Break The Oath. if you want to get a good album by King Diamond get one with him in MF cuz his solo stuff isnt that great. the concept of the album however is sweet as hell.
2,WHY SO MUCH PRAISE FOR THIS ???,"ABIGAIL's seems to be regarded as the best ever King Diamon album. It isn't. FATAL PORTRAIT and THEM are better. In this album, King seems to be free from any chains and screams like a madman all the while, totally hysterical, covering the guitar sound. The whole record seems buffed. The sound is annoying. As for Mikkey Dee, come on !!!! People keep saying how great he is. Mercyful Fate's Kim Ruzz was much better in feeling and much less ""glam"" than Mikey Dee !!! Have you seen the band photos in the booklet? I thought for a while that it was POISON !!! Of course Michael Denner's playing is a pleasure to listen, always, and that's why I don't rate this album one star only."
1,Worst KD,"First off, I'm a HUGE HUGE King Diamond Fan. I'm so tired of people regarding this as his best album, because it's not. The production is pretty bad. There is too much reverb on the drums. The vocals get annoying (and I like Fatal Portrait). None of the riffs really stand out. I used to listen to this along with everything up to The Eye back in the day, but never picked up his later albums as I assumed during the 90's he'd follow the trend of watering down the metal. I just recently checked out the new stuff and holy crap his new stuff blows the old stuff out of the water. If you want to get the best of KD pick up1. The Puppet Master2. Abigail II3. House of God4. Conspiracy"
2,HOW CAN IT BE?,"Since King Diamond writes lyrics abou horror and mystery histories, maybe he should write a songs called ""HOW CAN IT BE?"", that would deal about the amazing fact that how such talented musicians like La Rocque, Michael Denner and Mikkey Dee could work to such a singer like Diamond.King Diamond is a ""Love him or hate him"" kind of musician. I'm not on the hate side , but I just think is fantastic how this guy is capable of writing bery good metal stuff and them destroy them with his own vocals! It's like a father killing his own son!!!Ok, it's different, it's not commercial, the songs deal about horror stuff, but that's not enough for me. For me, Diamond is almost unbearable to hear. He's not like Dirkschneider or Brian Johnson, who have utterly weird voices, but manage to deliver them in a manner that fits the songs. Diamons does not do that. He screams, whispers, shout, talks, all of it without any talent, any fun. Blergh!"
5,A True Metal Classic Sounds Even Better,"Abigail is among the best metal albums ever recorded. The technicality, song writing, musicianship, vocals, atmosphere, plot are all divine in the most unholiest of ways. This remastered version sounds even better as it is easier to make out the notes while not losing the heaviness. Plus, a dvd is included that contains 3 videos and a concert.While I like every King Diamond album, some more than others, there is something magical about Abigail that puts it a hair above the rest. Long live metal!"
2,Stay Away!!!!!,"Let me first start off by saying that a lot of the rythm work on this album isn't bad, nothing really that stands out, but nothing that seemed horrible. Other than that the rest of the album is a let down. The melody work is the biggest downfall to this album. Instead of trying to work up some good melodies to his lyrics, King Diamond just came up with radom spurts of meaningless tunes that have no structure to them at all. The lead work doesn't stand out at all, and there are way too many boring solos for my taste. The concept for this album was pretty cool, but after listening to this album one time I didn't want to listen to it again. This album has absolutely no replay value. I would only recommend this to somebody interested in giving King Diamond a try. But to those just getting started in metal, and looking for some good heavy metal bands to start with, STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Good concept; bad result.,"I have to give this album credit for its concept. The lyrics are interesting, and the desired creepy and gothic atmosphere is generated effectively.Almost.I must admit that I am more of a fan of melodic death than anything King Diamond has ever done, so the guitars in this offering seem quite bland to me. The real kicker, however, are the hideous, hideous, hideous, HIDEOUS vocals. Someone must have been pumping severe doses of estrogen into poor Mr. Diamond's system when he was a child. Maybe he and Michael Jackson should make a collaboratory album...I would say that this band should dump their vocalist, but unfortunately they're fronted by said vocalist. King Diamond should stick to singing covers of ""The Lion Sleeps Tonight"" and attending face paint conventions, and leave metal to those who actually know what they're doing."
5,Led Zep,Just started using it and it seems pretty good....a little advanced but not difficult to follow.....would be better the more experience you have.
5,Brilliant and deeply moving,"This was one of the best books I have ever read. The descriptions and prose were perfect. The writer brings you into his world in a way that anyone, especially someone of his era, can understand. I wish there was more! I was an avid surfer in Southern California, as a kid. But then came college, a job, life in a big city, marriage, kids, and soon you just forget about the surfing lifestyle, how it feels, what it means. I was hooked on this book from the prologue. And if that was all this book was about, then it wood have been a very enjoyable, good read. However, this book is so much more. It not only brought back the emotions of surfing, but also the emotions of childhood and growing up. I am so stoked to have found this book, and will pass it on to all my friends and family. I think I pull my board down from the rafters of my garage and clean it off this weekend. Who knows what could happen!"
1,Contains Iron...,"It was my mistake to order the vitamins that contain iron. There are others of this brand that say ""No Iron"" on the label. My body's reaction after I began taking them caused me to check the label and discover the iron. I thought I could use them up by taking 1/2 tablet once per day; but I do not like the way my body reacts; so have stopped taking them. I do not know how I would like them if they did not contain iron."
1,Life force women's vitamins,"Extremely overrated. Way too expensive. had I known that I had to utilize 3 to 6 pills per day, I would not have purchased it at all.No difference, no change compared to other a lot less expensive vitamins I had used.Going back to old faithful for less than half the price and same results if not better.Again, over marketed and over rated. Not a customer at all."
1,Zero stars if I could!!,"I bought this vitamin after seeing several good reviews. I used Rainbow Light Womens Organic, and loved them but this one was spoken highly of so I thought I'd give it a try. HORRIBLE! As soon as I opened the bottle I literally gagged...they smelled just like urine...an old nasty outhouse. I took 2 and got sharp headaches off and on all day (I'm not a headache sufferer). If i could return them for a refund I would. I'll stick with what I know works from now on."
3,introduction rather than explanation,"This book should be considered as ""only and pure"" introduction to the subject. It suffers from the basic problem of social science oriented writing in mathematical issues: while trying to keep out ""complicated details"" it mystifies and obscures the subject and leaves out a lot of interesting topics. It would have been better to find ways to explain mathematical theory behind the concepts rather than frightening the readers by describing some issues as ""deep waters"". However, to be fair it is essential to say that the book with its concise manner and modest ambition still deserves some credit"
1,Too basic but complex,"It is amazing how complex is this book without the requiered formality for the field. As a very first approach, could be useful, but definitly, Tsai book is better."
5,COOL DOLL,"This doll is really cool,shes nice if you collect or play with dolls. She comes with a snow disk, its cool you can spin her on it. She also comes with a pair of gloves, a mug that has hot coacoa,a skirt, tights, a sweater and jacket,a scarf,ear muffs and a hat, lip stick and a small cell phone,two boots,jeans,a vest,a sweater,fluffy ends of pants that go on and off,a key-chain,and 2 backpacks. Shes tons of fun and sparks kids imagination. I have all the Winter Time Wonderland bratz and thy are fun to play with. They are pricey but I garentead you and your kids will like her."
4,Interesting find,"This doll isn't your typical doll. It doesn't have hair that automatically messes up after a week of it being out of the box. This isn't a type of doll where most people would be bored after ten minutes of play. But yet, people angerly say Bratz have these terrible qualities. I know these dolls aren't right for everyone, but they are right for girls who are too old for Barbie and My Scene, but to young to be called a teen. Because all those girls out there need a bit of fun..."
4,I REALLY LIKE THIS BRATZ DOLL,"I LOVE SASHA ANYWAY BUT THIS DOLL IS BEAUTIFUL. I LOVE THE HAIR, MAKE-UP AND CLOTHING AND I REALLY LIKE THE MATCHING HAT AND LEG-WARMERS. YEP SHE'S A DOLL ALRIGHT!!!!!!! ;-) 4.5 STARS. P.S. PLEASE ORDER MORE SOON AMAZON!!!!!"
5,Representing Great Music !,"Next to ""Let It Roll,"" this is favorite Little Feat CD. There is such a great mixture of flavors, styles, and textures here...from cool and funky with ""Woman in Love"" to slick and jazzy in the ""The Ingenue."" In my opinion Craig Perry is the best vocalist by far that Little Feat has ever had and during this period the band was blessed with creative and fresh songs. You can't go wrong with this one!"
4,Interesting,"Where this recording is not their best, the band explores some more interesting rhythms. Whether its the guitar driven Texas Twister, the jazzy interpretations of the title track and The Ingenue, or the heartfelt Feeling All Gone its all quite catchy. Craig Fuller comes pretty darn close to replacing Lowell's vocals on many of the tracks. A few ordinary tracks but the product is quite solid especially when compared to other music out during that year."
3,It's OK,"Not as good as ""Let it Roll"", which is immediately followed, but then again the disc would be hard to top."
3,one flash does the job,"I really dig this flash, although it weighs just as much as the camera and lens combined, and kind of puts it all off balance. It also doesn't light read as fast as id like, and takes a while after each shot to recharge the flash."
4,Slowly in recharge the power,"The flash works fine in all the functions. However, it only takes 2 AA batteries. The recharge the power seems a little slow."
3,large flash for a tiny camera,"I use withPanasonic DMC-LX3K 10.1MP Digital Camera with 2.5x Wide Angle MEGA Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Black)when I need more wide-angle lighting. GN 36. If you need more light, consider FL500 or use slave flashes. Larger than the camera, which is tiny. 2 AA alkalines offer flexibility. Can also use rechargeable Ni-MH."
2,Battery life is terrible,"The flash works, but only if you only want to take a few shots. I used the best possible batteries in this flash and only got 5 or 6 continuous shots before having to replace the batteries. Not good if you are shooting a wedding or something else where it is important to catch all the action without having to stop and replace the batteries. I returned mine."
4,"Great Phone, Many Features, Easy To Use, But BIG!","I have had at least 5 different phones, and this one is the best so far! It's got a lot of great features (all which have been mentioned from other reviewers), but let me tell you a few downfalls: it's big (very bulky); if you drop it, it seems like it would break easily (I haven't dropped it yet, but it definitely seems like it would break apart); it's camera is kind of hard to use (the lens is on the back, and when you flip it open its kind of awkward to see the picture), but other then that, it's great! Typing in text messages is easy, and it took ? the time to enter my contacts in the phone book (compared to other phones). I would definitely recommend this phone!"
4,Great deal for the features...,"I drive a tow truck and find its easy to use keyboard and GPS navigation great! Sound quality is good, MP3 player is a nice extra.. Works well with bluetooth headset, everyone admires it at work..Only Con I can think of is that playing games on it is not too great for lack of good way to control...If keys were re-mappable it would be ok..."
5,Good Phone!,"overall I love this phone! It has all the cool features that I want and i love the text messaging and the keyboard. But i am conserned about the battery life, but other than that minor worry, the phone is excellent! Good service and sleek and cool phone. Highly recommended."
3,Text messaging keyboard,"Apparently the designers of this phone overlooked the need to have the Text message keyboard Lighted. Or at least, we are unable to determine if it can be lit. The Verizon people told us it is not a lit keyboard, and I have found nothing to denounce their statement.So, don't buy this phone for what you THINK it might do...know before you buy."
3,Good for multimedia but not for calls,"I've had the phone for little over 4 days now and on at least 8 occasions I've lost service where my previous phone, the V710 did not. CHalk it up to no external antenna but when you consider this is a phone before anything else, you want guaranteed reception. I got this phone because of the keyboard and SD mini slot but unless you're a text maniac or camhog you won't really need this. I'll probably sacrifice the line in jack on this phone and go with the RAZR V3c which seems to not lose reception as much for a phone with an internal antenna."
4,not bad at all,"Everyone has their own taste(s) I happened to enjoy the movie. Like any movie, there are areas that need refining but I felt it was an interesting film none the less."
3,Better than expected,I've seen a lot worse with way more of a budget. I really liked the fake out in the middle of the credits. Thought it was over... Very cool
3,"not bad, could do better","It's an OK guidebook to Australia and I suppose it will improve in later editions. As a local who has travelled around Australia using it and the Lonely Planet, I'd have to say LP is better, Lets Go has a few fairly obvious errors such as names of towns on maps, and it lacks information about some ofthe more remote areas."
1,Mid-1980's technology and no playability... avoid this ripoff.,"Of all the toys my children have ever enjoyed, this one ranks at the very bottom. The box is marked as manufactured in 2007 but the pictures should have given it away to anyone that's been around Commodore 64's and Apple II computers since the 80's. Game play is similar to a mid-school computer science project. The sound is based on low-tech frequency generation and, frankly, the ""songs"" are not even recognizable. The scoring is more or less dicepherable but badly designed. To top it off, singing is not part of the game; kids can try to sing along the noise this toy makes but they'll only hear themselves through the amplified head set and mike.Save yourself the grief. This one was created to garner cash during the Christmas period and dissapoint your child. It's hard to believe major toy stores carry these and even worse that American Idol ever granted its license."
4,Nice evolution.,"I must say, other than the brilliant writing, that it is exciting to be able to watch, at my own leisure, the evolution of the Simpsons' characters. The loose, corny animation of the first season gave way to much more clean-- though, what's up with those mouths???-- and crafted animation just by the next season. Matt Groening reached into the brain of the public and pulled this out. Perfectly packaged with a nice assortment of goodie extras. I am so happy i added this to my dvd library."
4,Simpsons - old school style,See how america's favorite family started out. Homer wasn't as charismatically stupid. Bart more outspoken. Lisa more the stilted philosophical ideologist. Marge still undeveloped. The animation only barely getting to the level that we are used to now. See the first appearances of Dr. Hibbert. See all those episodes you completely forgot about. A must for any simpsons lover.
5,Kings of Comedy,"What can I say?... The second season has, in my opinion, 20 of the best chapters in all Simpson's history so far. If you enjoyed the first season, you're gonna love the second one. Worth every penny."
1,The Simpsons - The Complete Second Season,"I do not recall EVER having ordered this item, unless it was a LONG time ago and I gave it to a son-in-law. I DO NOT LIKE the Simpsons, so I know I would not have ordered it for myself."
1,horrible,"I've actually never seen it, I just wanted to provide information from a different prospective."
5,A must have for Simpsons fans,"How could you not buy this collection if you truly love the simpsons. The second season collection is a better bargain than the first, seeing how you get over 20 episodes compared to the 13 in the first season.The quality is great, and is slightly better than the first season. The first season DVDs would sometimes get the jitters (skip a little), but the second season DVDs do it less frequently and less noticeably.My one and only complaint is the need to press the select button three times (until spinning heads line up to their corresponding bodies) each time you put the DVD in for the first time. This is not a feature, but rather a distraction. Who likes endless screens that appear for 2-3 minutes before you can jump into a DVD? This is on the same level of annoyance."
3,They Cut out some of the greatest scenes...Why?,"...."" worst Simpson's Collection , ever.."" I hate to give anything with the Simpsons a bad rating, but on this I must make an exception. They cut a scene, in my opinion, from one of the funniest episodes. In the episode titled ""Bart the Daredevil"" the last scene where Homer falls into the gorge a second time, was deleted. In my opinion and according to the booklet included with the set, this scene was what made this episode a classic. So if you are a devoted Homer-lovin' couch potato like me, then you should expect to find not only the commercials deleted but also some of your favorite scenes as well. But overall it is enjoyable to see some of my favorite episodes from this season."
4,It would be perfect if it had a Spanish track,"I hope the publishers are reading this. The Simpson's is and will always be one of the greates shows EVER created. This DVD series has a terrible flaw....it does not have a Spanish Laguage track. That is a mjor omission since there are millions of viewers who love the show in spanish better than the one in English. Really....the translation to Spanish is so incredibly funny that, to us Spanish speakers, it is even better than the original English version. I hope in future releases they take into account this."
3,from a hardcore Simpsons fan,"The season as a whole I only give three stars. The shows are good at the beginning but sink into mediocraty near the end. This is definitely a better season than the first one. The jokes are better and the animation a little more secure. Many refer to season three as a ""turning point,"" but I see season two as the gradual evolution to season three and it's ""greatness."" The bad episodes near the end are the transition ones where the style isn't quite set. I'd have to say though, my favorite season of all time is season ten, but at this rate I will be lucky to see this on dvd around 2009 or so."
5,we were promised,I also remeber when we were promised the first three seasons by the end of the year and this one by christmas. First this one was supposed to bew released in June then July and now Augest its been almost a year since the releases of the first one why cant they be released like star trek's seasons are though i dont like that show and when is futurama gonna be released in the U.S.
1,They're not as funny as you think...,"I watched this with a big old group of friends. Let me tell you something from a (nearly!) middle-aged female point of view: you're probably laughing just because you hear everyone else laughing. It's not unlike being at a comedy club (which I'm no stranger to, having had some experience as a professional comedianne): at the club, the laughter is contagious, but if you see the same thing on TV, you don't even crack a smile.I think Julie Kavner has the most annoying voice this side of Fran ""the Nanny"" Drescher. And the less I say about Matt Groenig the better, trust me! Arguments broke out right and left when my friends invited me to their ""Simpsonathon"", an invite I will graciously turn down next time (and every other time after that!)."
1,What happened?,"I love the simpsons, but have no idea what happened. I wouldn't say not to order this set ,but just watch out. I Ordered mine and was sooo excited to watch my favorite episode , just to find out that they must have copied it onto the DVD wrong because the whole episode was in blocks and the sound was choppy. I quickly tried it in three othe DVD players with no luck. Yes some of the episoded DO work, and the Simpsons is with out a doubt the best cartoon series to date. Hopefully you have more luck with yours, but I will be pissed until I can watch ""Dancing Homer"" in peace."
3,check wally world,Hey I just saw this in Walmart for 19.99 full season/ boxed set....... also season 3 is for sale there for the same price........
3,Getting There....,"Though most people think that the turning point for The Simpsons was early in the seconed season, I think it hit it LATER in the seconed season. I bought the first DVD despite how bad season one was, to, and I have to say this season was not the best, but better than the first. The extras are similar to the first DVD's, but I mainly bought them for show anyways. I think the last two episodes were the funniest, but the others were okay, too. The charectors are developing more and more. Homer's getting stupider, Barts...well, Barts Bart, but he doesnt really change till later, Lisa's more laid-back, and Marge is more quirky. Over-all, it's a pretty good season, but there are better...."
2,NOT THE EPISODES AS ORIGINALLY AIRED!!!,"I guess I am a true ""Simpsons"" junkie because I gave this a 2-star rating instead of a 1-star rating as the collection allows me to watch 85% content unaltered Simpsons.The key crime here is that you ARE NOT GETTING THE EPISODES AS ORIGINALLY AIRED.In ""Bart the Daredevil"" the scene where Homer falls back into the Springfield Canyon while secured to the stretcher and then struck in the head by the stretcher is completely deleted. You only get to see children kneeling at the edge of the canyon listening to Homer's d'ohs.Had I known this I would have waited until I had drunk enough beer to render my memory so imperfect that I could enjoy this DVDand not notice the way it was edited."
4,Christmas gift,"Bought this as a gift for someone who is collecting all the seasons; also bought seasons 1, 3, and 4. He was happy with it, so I was too."
5,Awesome!,"I love this DVD collection, I've had it only days and watched every episode at least twice... it's an amazing collection, nicely done."
5,Another great season,I have watched the first 8 episodes on the DVD and so far so good. I hope to get the rest of the season sets. The Simpsons is still the best show on TV. Has been for the last 16 years and will be next year and the year after and for how long it goes on and in the future when it goes off the air.
4,Can't wait for season 4,"Don't get me wrong. I love this Special Edition but I've seen all these episodes hundreds of times. I don't believe the show really hit it's stride until the fourth season though, which I still think hasn't been surpassed. Note: Season 3 is out now! We're getting to the pinnacle of perfection! You'll want to own th first two seasons for reference."
5,simpsonsseries2bymjj_90,the first season of the simpsons was ok.the second season is my favourite though.the dvd comes with all 22 episodes with optional comentry.the menus are colurfull and fun.my favourite episode is dead putting socity and my least favourite is treehouse of horrer which dosent compare to later ones.the dvd case is also really good.overall its brilliant
5,<3,"Oh God I love this episode so much. I absolutely love the Simpsons, and this is definitely one of my favorite episodes. I love how the older Simpsons' episodes are so heart warming and emotional and almost always make me cry. This is no exception. Literally always brings a tear to my eye. It is just the sweetest I love it so much :)"
5,Great buy,"I've always been a Simpsons fan since I was little so now I've decided to buy all 22 seasons. I found this one for a great price, I received it fast, and in excellent condition, i had no problems with the seller. Thank you"
4,Vast Improvement,"22 episodes, Homer with his normal voice, and a higher quality of cartooning, all make Season 2 a great buy. The extras are great as they really show the timeline of the Simpsons history.Favorite Episode: Two Cars In Every Garage And Three Eyes On Every FishLeast Favorite: Old MoneyFavorite Feature: David Silverman on the creation of an episodeLeast Favorite: Bart on the American Music Awards"
4,PLEASE INCLUDE DUBBING IN SPANISH!,"The version in Latin American Spanish of the Simpsons has been recognized as one of the most talented and creative!!. Please, in the following collections include the dubbing in Spanish!!. I guarantee the sales of these collections will increase dramatically from all those Spanish-speakers living in the US and abroad"
4,Hooray for the Simpsons!,"I love this set and watch it basically daily--the quality of the episodes and the special features are great. However, the one thing that drives me up the wall about the set is that you have to spin the characters' heads at the beginning of each disc when you first put it in, before the list of episodes comes up, which is about annoying and useless, and only fun the first time. Other than that one little thing, it's a great set. The episode ""Lisa's Substitute"" is my absolute favorite of all time, and that alone makes the annoying spinning worth my while!"
1,Butchered!! Simpsons edited on dvd!,"Sadly I give this dvd one star because it is Edited. The season is great but they should have to print this information on the DVD. In BART THE DAREDEVIL Homer accidentily jumps the Gorge and falls and gets hit by the skateboard. Then when the ambulance hits a tree he falls again. On the dvd you just hear a scream and a lot of Doh's. On tv, depending on the channel, you usually get to see Homer banging his head, saying doh and there is blood. I assume this is edited for political correctness."
1,censored and edited,"Too bad. I have watched the first 2 dvds so far and have spotted two episodes that have been altered (censored) from the form they were originally aired in. Bart The Daredevil had a scene from the end completely cut (where Homer falls down the gorge while strapped to a gurney). Itchy & Scratchy & Marge sinks to even lower depths - for one thing the original reporter on ""Smartline"" (who resembles a popular on-air personality) was replaced with very poorly rendered Kent Brockman - and Krusty and Marge's scenes on ""Smartline"" were altered. To add insult to this, there is no indication on the package that such alterations were made. At least admit changes were made!!"
3,still not in its prime,this is a good dvd with lots of great features. The only reason that it gets 3 stars is that the simpsons had yet to hit there prime. The second season shows the simpsons rising towards the pleatue of greatness that lasted untill the late nineties. If you wanna have the best simpsons episodes on dvd wait for season 4 to be released.
5,The Simpsons Rule!,"This is the best that DVD has offered as of yet! The Simpsons always Rule, Matt Groening ( the creator ) knows just what to say and when to say it. Kudos to him and the Entire Simpsons Crew. These Cartoons rock, I cant wait for the next Set!"
2,Pulp science Fiction Magazine junkie alert!,"If you were/are a fan of pulp Sci-Fi magazine covers, then this a book you should get.But that is basicly all you get."
4,An auspicious start to a great group of early American novels,"Beautifully written and descriptive, this first of the Leatherstocking tales introduces Natty Bumppo as a raw backwoodsmen with exceptional hunting skills but qualms about fighting. His grappling with the issue as he protects a pair of maidens under siege begins to give birth to the 'Hawkeye' so well known in the follow-up novel ""the Last of the Mohicans'.The pace can be a little plodding, as chapters follow the plot's progress at almost hourly increments. That said, the action is gripping, the writing is otherwise crisp, and the characters have excellent depth."
1,Worst piece of early American literature ever written.,"Deerslayer is an absolutely terrible novel written by a rich swelled ego (Fenimore Cooper). There is no depth and no direction. It is a waste of paper and ink. Please, do not even waste your time even finishing reading this review for that would be too much time spent on the topic of Deerslayer."
3,"Pretty good novel, if you","Can get past all the verbage. I found myself skipping sentences or paragraphs because of the way the auther keeps going on and on about the same thing without a puase or even carrying through with the same thought in the same sentence (kind of like I'm doing now!).I really enjoyed the scenery images he paints, and the simple way of life portrayed. I also like the values the author held dear.The first few chapters and the anti-climax were horrible. I didn';t think I was going to finish the book because of the non-sensical talking that occur in the first few chapters. And the book ended in such a goofy non-realistic morose way, that I wish I had stopped reading a few chapters before the end and imagined the ending happen the way I would have liked it to.So I was dragging through the beginning, loving the middle, and depressed when I finished. Very odd sensation to read a book and get those kinds of feelings..."
3,OK,THIS MOVIE AS I REMEMVER HAD SOME BAD WORDS IN IT SO WE DIDN'T ENJOY IT AS WE DID THE OTHERS.MAYBE YOU COULD WORK ON THAT FOR THE AUDIENCE.
4,Pretty Darn Awsome.,"This little EP, while not Folds' best, is pretty sweet. The first track has one of the best solos he's ever recorded, besides being about the funniest thing I've heard all day. The 2nd track is made interesting for it's weird discoish string thing. The third track is probably the least good, it's a little boaring and reptitive. As is the next track, but it makes up for it in humor and style. The last song is a cover of a Ray Charles song, short but well done. A nice tribute. All and all a good album."
5,WCW Spring Stampede - Best PPV of the year,"This event was the best Spring Stampede ever and t best PPV of the year. The Bam-Bam/Hak match was amazing and the Kidman-Rey Reay match was unbelievable but i thought the main event was ugly. It should have been a lot better with four of the greatest superstars in the game. Anyway, dont spend 50$. A great PPV but for that much money i expected a lot more."
5,EXELLENT,"buy it,is an exellent ppv,the main event was fantastic,exiting,the whole ppv was the last wcw great moment,before the ratings were down,is one of the best ppvs ever."
5,Outstanding,I was there live at the tacoma dome for this event and it was the best I have ever seen here were some of the matchesJuvie vs. BlitzkriegBam BAM VS. HakKonnan vs. Disco InfernoRey Mysterio vs. KidmanSaturn and Raven vs. 4 horsemanBooker T vs. scott SteinerGoldberg vs. Nashddp vs. flair vs. sting vs. hoganBest PPv in WCW history and WWE history
4,Spring Stampede Review,All in all an ok show! Bobby Heenan's jokes in the hardcore match were funny as hell but then again The Brain is always funny though! The best matches of the night were the 4 corners wCw title match when ddp finally got what he deserved and Kevin Nash vs Goldberg was good too! The match between Hak and Bam Bam Bigelow was funny but slow paced. It sorta slowed things down that's why it doesn't get a 5 star review. All in all a good ppv and worth the [price] especially since wcw has shut down you need to have all it's memories. Rather you buy it used or new though used would be cheaper.
3,Not quite what I hoped for,"I bought this collection based on another buyer's enthusiastic review, and I must say I was rather dissappointed. The selection of songs is good, and all arranged in easily playable keys. The arrangements themselves are, however, fairly plain and unimaginative, with very (extremely?) repetitive basic rythmic figures getting boring after a short while. For really good pianists, this book may be a very good foundation for improvisations, but I'm unfortunately not on that level."
3,Elton John Piano Solo Collection,"Pretty on the mark music wise, but no lyrics. I was disappointed with that, but it's not a huge deal if you're an avid Elton fan like I am. I did not see anywhere when I bought the item that the lyrics were not included in this book, that should be corrected. Other than that, good book, on the mark music, but no lyrics."
1,Horrible,"It worked great for a few days, then as I got to the bottom of the batch of wipes, they were totally dry. Also, the whole thing flooded my changing table, not sure why, but I am returning this unit."
4,Bought it for Mom,I bought this item for my mother who is in assisted living and complains that the wipes are too cold. It works well. Wipes stay moist and warm. Haven't had any problem with the wipes yellowing or drying out. Mom loves it!
3,"Fine, but unnecessary.","This is one of those things you really don't need. This one works fine, but when the babies are so small that you want warm wipes, you really need a warm washcloth because they are too sensitive to the wipes."
1,Waste of [money],"I got this book as a price stuffer to [receive] free shipping at Amazon.com a while back. When I finally got around to reading it, I realized what a waste of paper it was. I cannot stress enough how outdated and lame this book is. The advise is amateurish and impractical for a website of any significant scale. It's a 56 page oversized pamphlet written in 12 or 14 font with no photos or screenshots. The illustrations are done by 1st graders and the entire ""commandments"" tone of voice is quite demeaning. There is hardly any useful advice here, you're better off finding updated knowledge online. The only joy I got was trying to find how many typos there were. Thumbs way down, I would not even donate this so called book to a book drive. I don't know what the other reviewers saw in this book."
5,Pleasant Scenery That Makes You Want To Come Back For More!,"I was on holiday in Montreal, Quebec City, and the Gaspe Peninsula in the Summer of 1999. This video captures alot of the highlights of my trip and points out many other great sites of this beautiful province. The resort and the water park are displayed very naturally. The background music just adds to man many pleasant scenes. I really want to go back to Quebec some day and see what I missed!"
1,A waste of paper,Thank goodness this book is out of print. It is at best a biographical novel and at worst a children's book. Hopefully it will remain out of print for many many years. Anyone want to buy my copy?
2,Buy the interactive hardback instead.,"This one is a cute little story, but the larger hardback is much nicer with interactive pieces to it that is much more intriguing to a young child. Spend a little more to get the hardback."
4,wheels on bus go round & round,"book arrived in excellent condition & in timely manner.books have been requested for baby shower ""special gift"", as they feel reading to a baby at a young age will keep the child reading forever."
4,Find the birthday girl!,"My 18 month daughter never tires of this one - she'll dig it out from amongst all the others on the shelf. There's a lot going on in each page for her to point out, with the continuity of the bus and the people that gradually fill it. It turns out the bus is going to a birthday party, and in the final page you can look for all the characters at the party, and try and spot the birthday girl. I'm looking for more books from this illustrator, because this one has been such a hit."
4,Good buy,Very nice illustrations. Every time my baby reads it she notices some new character and thats very exciting for her. Each page is packed with action.
5,sweet gloves,"These gloves work great with my weber performer grill. I only use lump charcoal and due to it's intense heat, it can be a little hazardous. These gloves allow me to handle a hot grate and move the charcoal baskets around, while loaded with red hot coals without loosing any more hair off my arms."
2,Almost like wearing nothing - not in a good way,"I like the fit and the manual dexterity. However, when I pulled a skillet out of a 450 degree oven today, it hurt badly, not much better than bare-handed. I am very disappointed. I look forward to using it with a grill when the weather warms up, but I won't expect a lot from it. In the meantime, I'm going to price welding mitts."
1,Misinformed,"I was informed that these gloves were available in 10"". I wanted to order a long pair and a short pair. What I received was 2 long (huge and clumsy) pairs of unusable gloves. When I called customer service at the vendor, I was told they are not available in 10"" - so they sent me two pair of the long ones. Disappointing for an Amazon vendor!!"
2,a waste,"Yes, it's got a great cast. Yes, it's got a fancy album cover. Yes, it's got the full libretto. Yes, you can hear the orchestra just fine. BUT, the sound quality is so bad that you can only barely hear the singers. So frankly, it's a waste of time and money."
5,blower motor,It was a grest buy and worked just fine. Shipped fast.Had no problems with the motor. Would recommend this blower motor for your car.
4,pretty good,"I have had an olympus 3030 for about two months now, I use it mainly for personal pictures and work (marine field biology). The pictures are sometimes great and sometimes not so great, and photoshop is fairly limiting. Resolution is of course very good, I use it on lower resolution for personal pictures and high resolution for digital analysis of marine pictures (with optimas software). Any possible marine housing would be extremely expensive, and I am sometimes worried about the camera dying from wave spray or rain. If I had it to do over again I think I would spend the extra $... and get a 3040 with the new ""brighter"" lens, or a sony camera with bright pictures and cheap housing. My major complaint is that if conditions are not perfect the pictures look washed out and can not be ""fixed"" adequately with photoshop."
5,"Great camera, Great price, Wait until you hold it to believe","When I was first researching for a digital camera (and it took a lot of researching) the photos for the Olympus C3030 were nice, but after we received it today and you actually have it in your hands - it's incredible! So small, so easy to use, and so versatile! Where can you find that in a camera. Olympus has done a fine job. I was very surprised though to find that on mysimon this camera was over $100 cheaper than Amazon. I guess you have to have that kind of profit margin to help bail the floundering boat, but why should we pay for it? I didn't have to buy two either to get my shipping free. But look around and get this camera. It is fantastic!"
4,"easy to use, good quality","I spent a lot of time researching digital cameras on the internet and found this one to be a good value. It's fairly compact, and it's lived up to its reputation. The Camedia software makes downloading the photos pretty easy. I just leave the cable hooked up to my computer and attach the camera when I need to download. No need for docking stations. As a digital camera neophite, I'm pleased with my purchase. I leave the 35mm camera at home now."
5,great product,"snapshooter convenience, professional level images. easy to use in default, amazingly flexible(complicated) when you delve into features. lens seems a little fragile when extended, but linked optical/digital zoom with one button improves greatly on c-2020, which i also have. this is my 5th digital, and i love it. with large-gig laptop, and pcmcia card adapter, it's easier than floppies."
4,Great camera...but,"I love everything about this camera except I must say to use a tripod. This camera is just awful if you have a shaky hand. You can't take any ""real time"" shots."
5,Really Great Camera,"I bought this camera after looking for a long time. It has many features. I also bought a 64 mb smartmedia and I can take up to 81 pics in HQ mode, and about 200 seconds of movie mode. The pictures are nice and crisp. Very Great camera for the price."
4,What gives it a star less?,"First, the bad things. Too much noise shooting under low light conditions. Also in low light conditions you'll find some green and white little points of light on the image.The camera has an almost useless flash.The good things: Video option is very useful. Output to see pictures and clips in TV's. Also you can use it if you want a larger view than the LCD display, just plug it to your TV, VCR etc. Great resolution for high quality printing.If you have some experience in photography you'll find great all the manual options."
4,Olympus C3030Z Camera,"Despite the problems with the optical viewfinder being off alot in the zoom mode, and the Quicktime sound falling behind the movie by a factor of 1 frame every 4 seconds, the Olympus C3030Z is an excellent camera for stills.Olympus has relased firmware version 80 which fixes the Quicktime problem, but they have no plans to fix the problem with the viewfinder."
5,Awesome Camera,"I have wanted a digital camera for a year and finally bought this one. I have never used one before... I simply opened the box put in the batteries and started taking pictures! Very impressive. It's so light weight you would think its a toy. The only complaint I have is the lense cap HAS TO BE OFF before you turn it on! I constantly turn it on without removing the cap, it makes this horrible crunching gear grinding noise. It takes true Olympus quality pictures! Very easy to upload without any extra purchase. It dose need rechargeable batteries NiMh kind 2 sets. I love it!"
5,it rules,"muahahha, i got this camera as a gift, and it rules.its nice, quick and easy and fun, and the batteries dont die down fast.i recommend it =D"
4,Nice for the price,"I own several cameras and had been casually looking at digital cameras for some time. My sense was that they are all much too expensive for their performance and that anything on the market today will be obsolete in a month. I picked up this camera as a close-out floor model for a very, very low price--- less than a quarter of list. I have found it to be a nice, convenient email photo camera with simple, easy-to-master controls. It's great for all those casual photos I don't want to spend a lot of effort or any money on. Limitations: slow action, LCD very hard to see in sunlight, and closeups are pretty much impossible, which was the biggest disappointment but not a huge surprise. I am very pleased with the camera at the price I paid, but I will stick with my Nikon SLR for quality shots. Judging from the reviews I have seen of even very high end digital cameras, the technology has quite a ways to go before I'm willing to invest much money in it."
3,Great camera for the price,"I'm an experienced digital photographer with a Nikon 990 for my personal use. I bought two of these for my grandgirls and was amazed at the quality and ease of use.1 megapixel quality is quite good for prints up to 5x7, and are great for monitor viewing and email. The camera is easy to use, the only problem the 10 year old had was accidentally pressing the ""quick time record"" button instead of the shutter release. Easy to do since they are close to each other. It doesn't have optical zoom, but hey it cost a hundred bucks. I added 10 meg of flash card memory which was a nice addition, particularly since I use a flash card reader. The included software seemed ok, with editing capability email sizing and easy install and photo downloading."
1,This camera ..,"Bought this camera in about 3 months ago for around $5o; I guess the pictures are okay especially when there's adequate lighting (such as outdoors). The flash totally washes the pictures out (wouldn't recommend using unless it was really dark). LCD screen is small but it works. Unfortunately the camera is already defective - it only turns on half the time even with new batteries, but what do you expect for $5o."
4,Nice camera for price,I am impressed how easy it is to use this camera. It uploads pictures very fast to my computer and color is good. Only minor complaint is the LCD screen is a bit small and washed out.I bought it on sale and good value.
3,HP PS120 1.0MP Digital Camera Review,Including a lens cap would have been useful. It is very easy to scratch the exposed lens surface. The LCD is weak but the camera makes decent pictures. I bought it for my son's second digital camera (he was six at the time) and he loves it. Now we need a CF card to hold more images between shooting and downloading.
2,The war above the trees,The first part of this book was very well written. but the last half of book took a nose dive.
3,"Beer, pork bbq, and this CD","This CD has much in common with the backyard bar-b-que from which it takes its name. Some of it needs to be thrown out, but most of it is so satisfying that as soon as you're done you start looking forward to the opportunity to do it again.You can never go wrong with Marcia Ball. The green bullet screams in that painfully pleasing way through BBQ at JD's. Hot Sauce will have you shaking your hips while you shake a little dry rub on those ribs.If you put sauce on your meat while you cook it don't buy this CD. You don't know BBQ so you probably don't know blues.By the time you make it to Heartburn, track 9, you should be ready to give yourself a little heartburn with what you are taking off the grill. Pop open another Bud and hit repeat on this disc. This is livin'."
2,NOT what I ordered @ all,I got a REAR MASTER Cover and not the Dress up kit as shown in the picturewhat was in the picture says 3 pc what i gor is 2 oc on the site says fits on all VTX and on the packing says just for Retro
2,"Nice, but one major flaw ...","the spine design, the case only naturally wants to open about as far as is shown in the picture of the case ... It *will* open further if you apply pressure to the front and back covers, but that is a very awkward and annoying operation to have to perform while also trying to carefully insert or remove a CD.It's unfortunate, because the construction of the cdProjects case and the CD sleeves are otherwise excellent. But Case Logic cases are also very nice, and they lay flat when open, which makes searching for and inserting/removing CDs much easier.I'll be sticking with Case Logic in the future."
4,Entry Level Cooling,"I installed this system on my i7 860 chip (not overclocked). There was no drop in idle cpu temps (22c) in a HAF 932. The full load temps are about 10c lower than with a stock air cooler in the same case (stock=45c new=34c). The radiator is larger than expected and needed to be mounted on the back of my case (fan is easily reversible). The cpu threading takes the longest time to install as they have the smallest threading I've seen on any type of screw. Overall, it's a great starter kit, and comes with all the tubing and fluid anyone should need for the initial install. Anyone looking for high performance liquid cooling should look elsewhere however."
1,For those that never read,"If you have even spent a little time in your life reading newspapers, magazines, the net, etc you will have seen 99% of these trivia lists and items. Save your money so you can buy a better quality toilet paper."
2,"Too cursory for much use, very often misleading.","Sorry to say but this book is a dud. While the concept of presenting interesting mathematical facts is great the presentation is so brief, so wrought with errors, and so incomplete that the work is not worth perusing.Some of the ""chapters"" have answers at the back of the book and some do not. It appears that the author could not make up her mind wether this was to be a ""math tricks"" book or a ""popular mathematics"" presentation substantiated by theory.There are many other excellent books that are more fulfilling. Journey Through Genius comes to mind.All in all a disappointing work."
1,A cursory look at mathematics,"This book may cover 147 topics, but each is only one or two pages long, much of which is taken up by illustrations. After listing a topic there is no depth showing how it relates to other topics, impacts our life, is useful or beautiful.After showing a topic of mathematics I'm left wonder why I might conceivably care."
3,Fun facts about math,"If you or your kid like math and how its applied, then this is a fun book for you.Its light reading with about one topic per page."
2,A bit of a letdown,"Finding this book, many people were estatic about it. ""Read it, you'll love it"" was the general feel about Anpao. Unfortunately, the book was rather weak in characters and plot; even the theme was not worth the short search to find. The goal and aspiration of this book is a good one, but it fails to deliver to its promising expectations."
1,What grade was this for?,I absolutely hated this book. The writing style was horrorble and I couldn't understand what he was thinking of when sometimes he would write one sentence and then jump to another which was totally different. It was so hard to read. I had to read this book for a book report and I hated it so much that I didn't finish reading it.
1,Let the series die in peace....,"This is one of those reviews where a person wishes they did not have to give any stars. As a fan of the entire Highlander series (movie and tv), this ""movie (if one can really call it that)"" is easily the worst thing that could have happened. I could not erase it from my DVR fast enough. As others before me have said, this movie makes the original cut of Highlander 2 look like the greatest thing on Earth. I certainly hope that if they plan on making another film and follow the story the set in the Source, the strongly reconcider and let the franchise die in peace. That would be the most humane thing that the producers could do for the loyal fans of the series and for the fine actors that that brought the characters we followed to life. Let it go already."
1,The Highlander Mistake,"I am a huge Highlander fan. I saw every movie in the theater, own them all on dvd, plus both series and the cartoon. This movie is truly an embaressment to the fans and creators of Highlander. Bad script, bad acting, bad editing, bad ending, bad writing. Awful all around. I hope it doesn't kill the future of the Highlander movies/shows but it certanly won't help it."
4,What Season 6 Would Have Been,"At first I had no desire to watch this movie, especially after reading all the awful reviews. However, I took the chance when Sci-Fi Channel reran the movie & enjoyed it. My reason for enjoying it was that I understood where the producers were going with the storyline as it realated to the TV series. Owning the complete Highlander: The Series on DVD, I was able to view the episodes with the added commentaries & saw the direction they had planned for the series had Adrian Paul stayed.The show was going to change to a darker version with a world falling into chaos and Duncan MacLeod searching for his roots & reason for being. This movie takes up where the series would have eventually gone. It was nice to see that Duncan's character continued where he left off in the series and continues his search & finds out who he really is, a member of the Clan MacLeod, who has a conscious and lives by it."
3,Not THAT bad.,"Taken by itself, it's not THAT bad. There is minimal continuity with the movies and the TV series, and it was made for television (the Syfy Channel), but it's entertaining enough to watch. There are several parts which are actually quite funny. There is some strong language, brief nudity, violence with plenty of blood, and occasional blasphemy."
1,Worst Highlander movie EVER,"Like someone else said, I wish I could give it 0 stars. I saw this for free, and while I didn't have to pay for it, I wish I had that 90 minutes of my life back. Honestly, the only good thing in this movie was that Peter Wingfield still sort of remembered how to pull off the Methos character. Even Jim Byrnes, as Joe, turned out bad. The plot was awful, and the ending didn't make any sense. And, okay, I admit it, I liked the ""renegade"" version of Highlander II, but there is no way anybody could ever, ever re-cut this movie to make it bearable. If you really need a Highlander fix, spare yourself and just go watch Season 4 again."
2,The End Of A Great Saga,"I will tell you right now this marks the end of the highlander movie series, This movie first came out via the internet as a torrent file as the russian cut leaked. Everyone saw this movie it was supposed to be originally released in theaters but the reviews were so bad that the producers were not going to take the risk of releasing it theaterically. So a couple months later the dutch cut of this movie premiered on the sci fi channel on september 15th. It was basically identical to the russian cut with very little editing. THe thing that hurt this film the most is its story line, Editing, quality, Dialogue, This film is missing so much. It makes the previous highlander movie Endgame look like a master piece. With that said i wouldnt recommend buying this unless your a die hard highlander fan like myself. If you are a new fan of the Highlander series i recommend only the first and third movie. Or the first and fourth movie and tv series/Good Luck"
1,Worst movie I've ever seen,"This is a review based on the version broadcast on the SciFi channel.I was so excited to see a new Highlander movie, though in reality I didn't expect much. Unfortunately, its every bit as bad and even far worse than Highlander 2. The story line is dreadful and (like the other movies) changes previous events. But in all, I think the main problem I have with the movie is the fight scenes. I mean, why did the creators all of a sudden decide to make everyone fight in super speed with ridiculous sound effects? This movie is absolutely horrid in pretty much every way possible.If only someone would make a Highlander movie worthy of the original (or better for that matter). Unfortunately, if it ever happens, I doubt it will be anytime soon."
1,Easily the worst Highlander film,"That's right - worse even than the disastrous Highlander II. The plot is laughable, the acting is either flat or cheesy, the directing is a mess, and the fight scenes are flat out goofy. People have been calling this the final nail in the franchise's coffin - and I think that's about right - unless someone comes along and decides to remake the original someday.RIPHighlander1986 - 2008"
1,This Nonsense Should Never Been Made,"I'm a huge Highlander movie and tv show fan. However:The plot was incomprehensible. The bad guy's acting and costume are laughable. Pizza the Hut from Spaceballs, a spoof of Star Wars' Jabba the Hut, makes an appearance. I kid you not. This movie was a waste of time and money for everyone involved in its creation. It was painful to watch, I felt embarrassed for every actor and actress in the credits. Avoid it if you have any positive feelings or memories left from earlier Highander incarnations."
1,Highlander: The Source,"The worst highlander film ever made. No queen song, no real plot concept, no real Highlander sense of being. I was utterly dissapointed. Good actors given a poorly layed out script. The guardian was a joker with stupid lines, no if and or buts about it. The end was empty and unsatisfying! Not worth a movie ticket, not worth 17.00, not worth 9.99, not worth 4.99 clearance price. MAYBE!! 1.00 buy at your own risk price."
1,Worst movie of all time,"As a die-hard fan of the series, and the original Highlander movie - I couldn't even sit through it, it was so very bad. Worse than Highlander II: The Quickening, really.If you are a Highlander fan, don't spoil the good stuff by watching this one.I agree with one of the previous reviews - if I could give it no stars, I would."
2,Sad but true,"I love Highlander. I thought this film a tragic waste of Peter Wingfield, Jim Byrne and especially Adrian Paul. I feel they did the best with what they were given. But I suspect who ever edited this movie was on drugs."
1,Highlander the search for fast cash,"(why doesn't amazon allow zero star reviews?)I understand they made this to try to get the last few dollars out there in this franchise. But come on what the****. I've watched everything highlander own all the movies,t.v shows, ect.... I decided to rent this rather than buy it after reading some reviews now all I can do is bring it back and pretend I never saw such a god awful piece of junk. Adrian Paul was an idiot for doing this film. It should be burned and never mentioned again in connection to the highlander franchise."
1,Only thing going for it are the fight scenes....but not by much,"I will imporle anyone not to watch this!This film was utter garbage. It tore apart everything that the ""Highlander"" series was. If this wasn`t the last movie of the franchise of the ""Highlander: series"" it should be. The Source was supposed to anwser our questions about the origin of the immortals and why they fight to the death. The anwsers are nothing more than confusing. In fact the enitre movie is a confusing mess!If you want a good and bit more original Highlander story, check out the animated ""Highlander : Search for vengence."""
1,Horrible movie,"""The Source"" on Sci-Fi sucked, and the DVD isn't any better. This is a horrible installment in the Highlander series. Just like how ""Rocky V"" was a killer to the Rocky movies, ""The Source"" might kill off the Highlander movies. It's just so horrible!"
1,A waste of 86 minutes!,I too am a big fan of the TV series so was extremely disappointed by this film. The film might star Adrian Paul but it has none of the production values of the TV series. Even the score sounds like it was recorded by a Queen tribute band instead of the real thing. The special effects are unbelievably bad. Don't waste your money or time watching it.
1,Not even a B film,"This movie was VERY, VERY, VERY bad. Not even worth one star but I had no choice. The acting, the sets, the story, the action and the flow of the movie is just awful. Seriously....anyone who says that this is a decent film does not know movies at all. This is an abomination of the whole franchise. I've watched better episodes from the TV series than this crap. The sets were so corny and fake looking. The budget must of been 3 million because that's what it looked like. This movie was cheaply done and it shows in every aspect. They should be ashamed of themselves for sending this rubbish to fans. I don't get it...it's 2008. The old story is so outdated. Here is a idea, REBOOT the character/franchise. Start over and do an epic movie with good writers and a good budget. Please, please do the first one over and start from there. WITH CONNER MACLEOD.Update: A new Highlander reboot is in pre-production. Conner MaCleod will be the character featured. ALRIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,What Were They Thinking? So Very Bad!,"I am a huge Highlander fan and was very happy ""Highlander: The Source"" came out to bring closure to the movies and various series. All I can say is, what a disapointment. This movie deviates in almost every important way from everything that was good about Highlander.Put this in the same pile as the second Highlander movie, and pretend it doesn't exist.NOT RECCOMMENDED!"
2,Peter Wingfield in leather,"Ok, ok, ok, it's not the best movie ever made. Years of Highlander mythology is kicked to the curb, Adrian Paul acts like he has a bad case of constipation, and they kill a major character for no very good reason. But people, this move features Peter Wingfield In Leather!!!!No movie which does this can be judged to be all bad."
1,Poorly executed sequel...,"After Highlander: Endgame I was expecting a film on the level of that movie, but what was released left me dumbfounded. The only thing I liked about this movie was the visual style, and the concept of 'The Source'.Now I'm not an expert on the Highlander movies, but every Highlander movie I've seen had flashbacks to the Highlands of Scottland where Connor and Duncan lived hundreds of years ago. I always thought that helped ground the movies and give reason to call it 'Highlander' in the first place.The use of colors and the way scenes were framed made the whole movie feel alot like it was a living comic book, and the concept of The Source is basically that the history of the immortals had gotten lost in myth and the original intent for ""There can be only one"" wasn't to be the last immortal standing, but to be the only immortal to pass the test by the Source. But even withsuch a seemingly good concept and visual style the producers used poor execution."
1,Don't waste your money,I wish I'd have read the reviews before buying this movie. I can't believe that the actors could possibly have thought this was GOOD after 6 seasons of the TV show. I'd be embarassed to have my name attached to this movie.
4,It really wasn't that bad.,Compared to the original release of the 2nd Highlander movie this last one was pretty good. It wasn't as good as the first but if you're a fan of the TV series and can handle some new characters that maybe weren't really needed then it was alright. The main villain was a bit cheesy and slightly confusing but I didn't watch it for him since it's a well known fact that the villain will always die in the end. There were some good scenes and I think the end allows for a continuation since the movie's website said this was the 1st of a trilogy. We'll see.
1,Bad. I mean REALLY bad.,"I have been a fan ever since the first movie came out. The franchise has definitely had its ups and downs over the years. This is not only a bad Highlander movie, it is one of the worst movies ever made. I found it to be as close to unwatchable as a movie could possibly be.The only reason I gave it one star is because Amazon does not allow zero star reviews. This movie deserves the introduction of negative stars for reviews."
1,Perhaps the worst movie ever,"If you are a fan of the TV series DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE. Besides having basically no plot, bad acting, bad fencing/fighting, bad cinematography, it destroys your favorite characters - figuratively and literally. I knew better than to watch this, but I fell into the trap during the SciFi channel Highlander marathon. It will take a while to get this horrid taste out of my mouth."
1,Worst movie ever. Really.,"I think this actually qualifies as the worst movie ever. It's certainly the worst I've ever seen, and I used to watch B-lot horror films (at least they don't have pretensions of being good). Seriously, the plot makes no sense, the acting is horrible, and the sets are ridiculous. It doesn't even pay to go into detail about how terrible this film is as doing so would require a comment on every singly line of dialog, every absurd costume, every nonsensical, contradictory setting (cannibals in huts with guns and motorcycles?), and every absurd violation of physics (planets coming into alignment makes them huge in the night sky). The only reason this gets even one star is that Amazon doesn't allow zero. Just recalling the movie enough to write this is making me stupider. I want my 85 minutes back."
1,WTF guys. WTF,"This is not only the worst installment of the entire Highlander franchise, but quite possibly the worst movie ever made. The acting is horrible, the sword fights are lame and impossible to follow, the soundtrack is awful, the direction is bad, the ending sucks, and it has officially hurt my respect for the series as a whole. Don't waste your time with this--pretend that Highlander: End Game was the end of things and be content."
1,This is how you kill a franchise,"Highlander was never set up to be a franchise in the first place, but that didn't stop them. Things just got worse and worse. I'm ashamed for having seen this movie. There is no way that anyone read this script and thought, ""Oh yeah, fans will love this."". And there is certainly no way anyone involved in this film thought they were making a good movie. Truly one of the worst films I have ever seen."
1,Painful,I love Highlander. Loved the TV shows and all the movies....until this one. It was so painful watching this movie (on Sci Fi network) that I almost cried. It felt as if I had undergone a trauma that I wished I could somehow forget but knew it would leave a lasting scar.
1,86 Minutes I'll Never See Again,"I think that if there had never been ""Highlander: The Series"", this movie would just be BAD. However, after how thoughtful and imaginative the series was, there are no words for just how bad this movie is. I wish I could be as sarcastic as the character of Dr. Gregory House in describing this movie but alas! words fail me as they must have failed whoever wrote this wretched screenplay who, I am convinced, never watched an episode of ""Highlander: The Series"". But at least they are releasing the series on Blu-Ray."
2,Methos,"After hearing this was a straight-to-Scifi Channel movie I had my doubts. The only reason I continued watching after the first five minutes was because I knew Methos was in this movie and I would walk through fire, or sit through this movie, for that ROG! This could have gone in such a better direction if only the ridiculous special effects hadn't been thought of nor the idea to go futuristic b/c that worked so well for Highlander movies in the past... I really don't have any words to describe the epic failure this movie left with me and I blame Methos for making me watch it."
1,Astoundingly terrible,"There really isn't too much to add to the other reviews; this movie is dreadful. The special effects are worse than anything I've seen since the 70s. The audio/sound-fx are horrific. The acting is uninspired. There is no story and what they've attempted doesn't fit in with any part of the Highlander-universe.The best part of of the series was, of course, the swordfights. Rather than choreograph a fight here, they've elected to take a picture of the characters and jiggle it at high speed around the set. Like seriously, I could make a better fight scene with my great-grandmother and a tortoise.Do not under any circumstances consider buying this horrific piece of nonsense."
2,"I'm a fan, but this movie was a let down","I hated the atmospehere as it opened. Reminded me of a bad attempt to used some of the stuff from a Terminator movie, or even Mad Max. There was no originality. I stuck through it and it just got worse. I enjoyed seeing Jim Byrnes as Joe, and of course Adrian Paul as Duncan and Methos...but after I waited years to see a sequel - the writing was bad for this movie. Endgame was a great movie, and so this one is dissapointing. I do like the end though. I wish they could have told us more about his wife - how they met, their life, their marriage, their troubles...seemed like it lacked character development. It's hard to vision Duncan separated from a 'wife'. I do hope they make another movie showing Duncan having a son, and make it more like the series Highlander and the movie Endgame. Then I'd go to the theatre and see it."
2,The Final Installment of the Highlander Saga,"I have to admit I was disappointed with ""The Source"". It just wasn't what I expected. But I also have to admit, I would watch Adrian Paul peel potatoes. Adrian Paul was wonderful as usual!"
1,Horrible Highlander Blasphemy,"Let me preface this review by saying I love Highlander. I own every season of the series, movies 1-4 and quite a bit of merchandise. However, I must concur that Highlander the Source was absolutely horrible. I sat through it only because I was in such slack jawed shock at the absolute substandard garbage that was on the screen, I was unable to reach the remote. I commend the actors for their professionalism in not walking off the set, but I honestly wish they had.In Summary:If you missed Highlander the Source it was probably because it never made it to the big screen, it was for very good reasons.If you watched Highlander the Source keep telling yourself that this horrible Highlander blasphemy NEVER happened! Eventually you can forget it, but then you see an ad like this one and the pain returns. This never happened. This never happened. This never happened."
4,Honest,"Many have complained about just about everything about this movie. My opinion is this, (by the way i have also seen every movie and tv episode as well), the budget is the only issue. Mabey Two over the top acting performances, and a general lack of set quality. However, The story was fine, they did do some history flashbacks (someone reviewed that they didn't, false) that were not up to par with previous titles, this is where i again fall back to budget. Some ok fights, (the main villains movements tacky, budget issue) and otherwise good movie.Conclusion,If you are a TRUE ""Fan"" of the ""Highlander Story"" and you can tolerate a low budget film, then you should enjoy this title.Just give it a chance and understand from the start that IT IS A LOW BUDGET FILM.I recommend this film with reservation in regards to viewer."
1,Makes Highlander 2 look like Lord of the Rings,"This movie absolutely sucks. Period. Should be zero stars. I can't believe Adrian Paul would make this. He must have been contractually obligated. It's time for a reboot. This time make a Highlander movie with sequels in mind from the beginning, instead of haphazardly putting this crap together."
1,The dregs of the barrel,"Endgame was a tedious but logical attempt to bring all the plot threads of movies and TV series to an acceptable conclusion. It really should have been what the title claimed, the ENDGAME for the Highlander series ! This straight to discount bin effort is a blatant attempt to squeeze the last dime out of a dead franchise, it's poorly made, stupid and feeble beyond belief.I rarely give one star reviews, usually being able to find some redeeming feature, even in the laughable works of Uve Boll. This however is a mercenary piece of junk that deserves incineration."
2,Bad Film,"There is no nice way to say this...this is a bad movie. It's not even one of those that's so good it's bad, it's one that's so bad I actually have to own a copy so when people don't believe it's that bad, I can show it to them & we can then mourn the loss of those hours of our lives together.The performers did what they could with what they were given, & the story line, while appearing dedicated to killing the franchise rather than rejuvenating it, is easy to follow. The direction and cinematography however...The movie has the look and feel of a poorly shot mid to late 80's music video.I have loved the Highlander franchise for years. This film is the worst of the worst of it."
1,Stop with Endgame,"As you may have heard, this movie is beyond bad.I will mention the bad acting of the original characters that will ruin any good opinion you ever had of them. And I love them all, have all movies, series, etc. But please spare yourself this desecration.And Adrian Paul looks like he's going to hit 50 any minute.Keep the memories in your dreams and skip this!"
1,Hilariously bad!!,"FOR HIGHLANDER FANS ONLY!!!I invited a few friends over. They knew the overall premise to Highlander itself. So we watched Endgame & The Source back-to-back. Everyone involved said they enjoyed Endgame. Fortunately, we had plenty of Heinekens to go around. By the time we got to The Source, we were relaxed, buzzing, & laughing our a--es off throughout the entire film. So, if you thought The Source was bad, grab some beer, & then re-watch it. You shouldn't be disappointed!"
1,Highlander II returns!,"For those who loved Highlander II, this movie is for you. This is supported by the fact that they even advertise Highlander II's newly enhanced DVD in the opening previews!For the rest of us Highlander fans who loved the original movie and the t.v. series, this one is at best a rental. Aside from the cast (Joe, Duncan, and Mythos), it lacks any resemblance to the t.v. series.This film takes place in the near future in which all government and law has broken down (aka Road Warrior). A few immortals remain and go on a quest to track down ""the source"". So scrap ""there can be only one"", forget about historical flash-backs involving Duncan or Mythos that develop their characters, and instead insert an immortal ""mutant"", loads of bad acting and generic scenes and *poof* welcome to Highlander V.This film is a great disappointment to this Highlander fan."
1,The SciFi Network Should Be Ashamed!,"This is an original production of the Sci-fi Channel and it's bad. Production values are incredibly cheap. The only good thing is that Adrian Paul and some of the other actors from the excellent TV series reprise their roles. Fans of the series, be forewarned. The idiot writers had the nerve to kill off Joe Dawson (Jim Byrnes)in this poor effort. They relegated Methos (Peter Wingfield) to a cameo appearance that is, thankfully, dignified and compelling. Effects wise, the main battle with the villain (wearing ridiculous make-up) is a Keystone Cops fast motion fight. Trust me, I have seen every episode of the Highlander TV series and ALL the films. There can be only one and this isn't it. And, yes, the other reviewers are telling you the truth: Jabba the Hutt makes a cameo appearance. This film is such a sad addition to the Highlander canon. If you are a Highlander fan you will be embarrassed."
1,This is as bad as it gets,Watching this movie you would think the producers are going out of their way to kill the franchise. None of the things that made the original Highlander movie or the TV series so good are here. They turn the entire mythology previously established on it's ear. I think this movie was filmed for theatrical release but then they could not get a distributer so went to TV instead. After watching it you can see why only Sci Fi channel would show this garbage. It fits right in with all of the bad B movies they make. Do your self a favor and skip this one.
5,Awesome Movie!!,"I had low expectations about watching this movie after reading all the negative reviews.....boy was I wrong! I have never watched the tv series, but being a fan of the movies this was excellent!"
4,"hello california,how are ya?","Thats right, each copy smells of lazy days out west.the sunhas done its thing and the langour of late evening has arrived.have beer,couple of smokes all you need is the soundtrack.this is where tommy guerrero comes in.mr guerrero hasdevised a whole new genre ,a hybrid of bill whithers,tom jobimand the mgs{all good}.unquestionably rougher around the edgesthan the a 'little bit of something'featuring many of the same tracks but its unpolished nature only adds to the charm of the whole package.of the tracks thaat dont appear on 'a little bit..''keep on keepin on' and' in my mind' are immediate classicsand worthy of the cover charge alone.the rest if not reachingsuch mesmeric heights will invariably bring a smile to the mosthardened scowls."
5,A very well written trip to the bayou,John Biguenet's Oyster is a deeply dark and interesting novel that tells the tale of two familes immersed in a deadly rivalry in the late 1950s. The characters are well developed and the plot is engaging to the reader. Biguenet reminds one of Faulkner and I would highly recommend this novel which is hard to put down. I was sorry when I finished it.
4,Blood on the Bayou,"Biguenet does a good job of taking us into the world of Louisiana oystermen (and women). As a Louisianan, the story made me wonder how much different or more difficult it is now to make a living as an oysterman, with the bayous disappearing and the lifestyle of the Cajuns being slowly squeezed out of existence. The in-book review likened ""Oyster"" to a Greek tragedy and I can see why, as power and revenge are played out among the characters. Be very careful of whose lives you try to control."
3,Some things are done well.,"Oyster is a tale of 2 families set in the backwaters of Louisiana. One family is rapacious, crude and successful, the other is decent but failing. Oh, the decent family has a murderous daughter, who is otherwise very appealing. The book is crafted at the level of a fairly well written crime novel. Biguenet is good with the fishing life, bayou version, and his scenic passages are very well done."
1,"Insipid story, leaden prose","This novel never went anywhere. It is hard to understand how such a weak story, poorly written, populated by so many one-dimensional characters, could find its way into print. Biguenet is a pretentious writer, with little to say, who offers up caricatures better found in made-for-TV movies. His dialogue is embarrassing; his attempts at ""regional flavor"" an affront; his plot utterly devoid of originality. There is a ton of Deep South fiction to savor -- Welty, Percy, Faulkner -- before turning to the likes of Oyster. I regret that I bought this book."
1,Food for thought,"[...]. Splenda is the culmination of experiments conducted in labs seeking to create new pesticides. Yes, you read that correctly.Diabetics, weight watchers, calorie counters, I encourage you to do a little more digging into refined sugar substitutes. I also encourage you to look into Upper Cervical Specific Care as a possibility in refining your health status. Many folks, through traumatic events (accidents, slips, falls), have caused damage to one of the most vital structures that is very little understood in the public eye--the brain stem. An injury to this area can lead to such conditions as diabetes, decreased thyroid function, and more.[...]."
3,Too much sugar,"Readers trying to eliminate sugar from their diet will be disappointed by this book. A high percentage of the recipes include ""real"" sugar in addition to Splenda: brown sugar, regular granulated sugar, powdered sugar; and also ingredients containing significant amounts of sugar, such as sweet or semisweet chocolate chips. The author should have at least provided alternate non-sugar recipes for all recipes."
2,Not what I had hoped for...,"I suppose it's a good book in it's own right, but I bought it with the hopes of finding some good low carb dessert recipes. Instead what I found are recipes that are low sugar, not the same thing at all. In addition to cutting the sugar out, she seems to concentrate on cutting a lot of the fat out of the recipes, which tends to add carbs in some form.If you're on Atkins, this is not the book for you. There are a few recipes that are lower carb, but nothing that I couldn't get from straight Splenda=Sugar substitutions, and often not even with as good of results. Custard and cheesecake are 2 that pop to mind that are simple enough to do straight substitution without sacrificing flavor or texture. I didn't need to pay for this book to get those recipes.All in all, rather a disappointment."
4,Unbelievable Desserts With Splenda,I think this cook book will help me make desserts I will be able to enjoy now that I have been diagnosed with Diabetes. There are several desserts that I will make & take to cook outs & parties.
3,It's okay,"I try to have a very low sugar diet, and this book had some good recipes. the cheesecakes were excellent, the cookies generally turned out pretty well, but all the cakes/cupcakes I tried were terrible."
4,Excellent!,"""Unbelievable Desserts with Splenda"" is a cookbook for sweet treats that are low in sugar, low fat, and low calorie. Splenda is used instead of sugar for sweetening and all the recipes are low in fat. The treats taste great!Why not five stars? Though Splenda seems to have an excellent safety record, I am not 100% convinced about all the safety matters, if one totally substitutes for all the sugar that conventional recipes require. I would say that one should read up on concerns with various artifical sweeteners.One of the nicer aspects of this book is that some of the recipes can be prepared by a creative cook, using other sweeteners in amounts calculated to give equivalent sweetening. Also the methods used to cut fat are applicable outside this cookbook.For diabetics, it is really nice to be able to have a treat in the refrigerator that will not harm one's diabetic diet. I do recommend this cookbook."
5,A fabulous read!,His only book? Tell me it isn't so! What a great new author. I can't wait for more.
5,COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN,I am in the process of reading all of Mark Gimenez's books. Hopefully he will have more new books coming. I live in Texasand am familiar with lots of the places he talks about.
3,Chips on his shoulder,"If you don't like the city of Dallas, lawyers, college football or anyone with money, you may enjoy the various slams delivered in this book. It's an easy read, but the many chips on author Gimenez's shoulder get in the way of what is otherwise a fairly predictable legal/thriller. You also have to accept the fact that a federal judge would appoint a civil attorney to handle a criminal death penalty case. Not likely."
1,DISGUSTED AND FURIOUS,"THIS WRITER, MR. GIMINEZ, IS A RACIST. IN HIS MIND, NOT AN AFRICAN AMERICAN ALIVE CAN PUT A SENTENCE TOGETHER. IN HIS EYES, THEY ARE ALL POOR, UNEDUCATED, AND AMORAL. I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT THIS RACIST WAS ALLOWED TO PASS THIS ""BOOK OF HATE"" OFF AS ""FICTION"". SHAME, SHAME, SHAME.BY THE WAY MR. GIMINEZ - THERE ARE PLENTY OF POOR, UNEDUCATED, AMORAL WHITE PEOPLE OUT THERE - WHY DON'T YOU WRITE ABOUT THEM SOMETIME."
1,Don't Waste Your Time and Money,"This book is not, repeat not, the legal thriller it purports to be. Instead it's nothing more than a book on race relations. Mark Gimenez is obsessed with race. Just in case you missed the fact that a rich, privileged white lawyer is defending a poor black hooker, he repeats it every two pages.It seems everything Gimenez knows about Dallas, he learned from watching the TV show ""Dallas."" I was shocked to learn that he is actually from the Dallas/Fort Worth area. I've lived in Dallas/Fort Worth for over ten years, and I can't believe we lived in the same area.This book doesn't have characters, it has caricatures. Characters appear, say their clichéd lines to move the plot along, then disappear until they're needed again.Don't be fooled by the fake reviews that proclaim Gimenez as the next Grisham or this book a literary classic. If you paid more than a $1 for this book (like me), you paid too much."
4,"A Good, Enjoyable, Although Predictable, Read!","Mark Gimenez's first legal thriller is very fast-paced and highly entertaining. With the exception of the two nine-year old girls (who are too ""cutesy"" and knowledgeable to be very credible), most of the characters are pretty well-developed and believable. The plot is interesting and exciting, and Giminez's cynical description of what being a top corporate lawyer is like seems very accurate. The Color Of Law, although ultimately mostly predictable, will keep the pages flying through your fingers. If you are into legal thrillers, I think The Color Of Law is a book you will enjoy."
3,Cynical on lawyers,"Wow, all lawyers are not that greed-minded. Guess it makes for a better read. I was married to a Dallas Lawyer for 50 years. And there are Dallas lawyers who don't always chase the big bucks, have integrity, and make a good living for their families. Guess the book is OK when you don't have anything else to read. By the way he is always a little cynical on Dallas..you can pick apart any city if you want to..we don't live in a perfect world. But I did finish the book, just wanted to see how he ended it. Ho-hum!!! Mary E"
4,A wonderful book Finding this author is a major find and i would rate him against John Grisham anytime,Once you put your nose into this story you will not be able to put it down This was the 2nd book I had read from this author and I have just downloaded another to my kindle
3,The Color of Law,"I found the overall story appealling and enjoyed the choices which the main character had to make. Although somewhat predictable, the plot kept me interested until the very end. Unfortunately, I was disappointed in the apparent need to use explicitives (f-bombs) and the common need to lower the characters to engage in menial sexual acts. I understand it sells but not for me."
5,Great Gift for the Holidays or Any Time!,"The Color of Law far surpassed my expectations. Mark Gimenez has written a fast paced, intriguing legal thriller that I lost a lot of sleep over because I couldn't put it down.It was easy to put myself in attorney, Scott Fenney's place and go through the roller coaster ride his life became right along with him.There isn't a dull moment anywhere in The Color of Law. I hope the next Gimenez novel is published soon. Losing sleep would be well worth it!"
4,No Cop Out,I liked this first novel from Mark Giminez a lot. It held my interest throughout the entire story because it was an honest story. The situations and reactions were real. The ending lived up to the rest of the book because the author didn't cop out.
2,An Early Attempt at Explaining Wicca,"Admittedly the goals of this book are fine, but it misses the mark by having way too many details about Wicca to serve the purpose of explaining this way of life to family and friends. The book WHEN SOMEONE YOU KNOW IS WICCAN does a much better job. Nevertheless this book is interesting and worth reading, but does not serve its intended audience."
2,Not good...like really not good.,"First a foremost, I bought this on a whim. I had no idea what this anime was about, didn't check out any other reviews, just wanted a surprise. Boy did I get one...Story: Was alright the first, um, 2 episodes, then it just never picked up and went south...fast. You won't care for the characters at all...AT ALL. There are just way too many characters, none of them are developed, just totally shallow and pointless. One positive note was the occasional funny bickering of the lead guy and two of the lead girls...but that's it.Animation: Not good. Just not good. There are a few fight scenes, and even then the animation is lackluster.Overall: Just not good!Save your money and buy something else. This was a waste of time, patience, and money. I'm surprised I even made it to the end."
4,Well Planned Out and Not too Complicated,"I purchased this book initially because of the great resource of exercises contained in the book. But, upon closer examination, I found that not only is there the aerobic and ""resistance"" training, but Roberts also gives concrete guidelines for diet changes . I think this is a really great book, and the breakfast energy smoothie that he recommends as part of his ""detox"" plan was Yummy! I wasn't hungry all day!! I am very excited about this book, and about the new body that I'm soon going to have."
4,Brother Quattro phone system,"A feature packed product with few disadvantages. Works well, is easy to set up and use. Range of the 900MHz cordless indoors is a little disappointing, and a 2.4GHz version would be nice. Build quality is not the best, but is commensurate with the important part, i.e. the price! The starter kit is particularly good value, but while it is capable of expansion to 12 extensions, it becomes pretty expensive to do that, although one has to bear in mind that it is a 4-line device! The addition of a headset of better quality than the ""free $20 value"" one that comes with the kit would be a nice touch.All in all, as a good 4-line system for a small premises, I can wholeheartedly recommend it!"
2,Prepare to be let down,"This CD sounded very appealing to me when I first saw it. Any 007 fan would love a compilation of the greatest Bond hits. However, there is one all-important factor missing from this CD: The original artists! Dont expect to hear Cheryl Crow belting out ""Tommorrow Never Dies,"" because it's not her. Hoping to hear Tina Turner sing ""Goldeneye""? Look elsewhere. In all fairness, some of the renditions are better than others; ""The World Is Not Enough"" comes across fairly well, as does ""Goldeneye""; However, ""Live and Let Die"" follows its own advice and ""The Living Daylights"" is just plain sad. (Who would have thought A-Ha would be such a hard band to cover?) Can somebody tell me why the chorus for ""The Living Daylights"" is in the background and panned to the right? If you're looking for a cheap version of 007's greatest hits, you've found a winner. If you're looking for the quality originals that made Bond great, keep searching."
5,One of the best sophomore efforts ever!,"How does that saying go -- an artist's first record is about their whole life, and the follow-up album is about the next six months? Given that ""Exile in Guyville"" changed my life forever, I was fully prepared to be disappointed in the second album by Liz Phair. However, ""Whip-Smart"" came through with another stunning lineup of songs whose lyrics sounded like she'd raided my brain (such as ""Jealousy"").The melodies are a little more catchy in a ""pop"" way than on ""Exile"", but are just as addictive. There are more radio-friendly songs on ""Whip-Smart"" than on her debut effort. However, these do not overshadow or outshine those songs on the album that are less ""single"" in nature. Rather, they are equal contributors to an incredibly satisfying whole."
3,The middle ground,"This CD is the middle ground, between her first and third CD. The songs aren't a sexually orientated as Guyville, or as much of a character study as Whitechocolatespaceegg. They're somewhere in between. This CD isn't so polished as Whitechocolatespaceegg either, but you can tell it's on a bigger budget than her first CD. Most of the songs are about relationships, be it before, during, or after. The only problem is that some of the songs sound the same."
3,A Solid Second,"While Whip-Smart does not reach the near perfection of Exile in Guyville, it certainly showed that Liz Phair would be more than a one-record-wonder. Her style unmuted, Ms. Phair sings about the trials of love (as with her first record) but in a more knowing voice. Radio favorites including ""Supernova"" and the title track made the record a plausible hit, though it never reached sales expectations. Indie gems include ""Shane"", ""Go West"" and ""Nashville""."
4,What's a real singer?,"I can't even believe the reviewer music lover had the audacity to write that Celin Dion is a real singer! She isn't crisp in her delivery and her songs are rubbage! She, Madonna, Britanny Spears and the likes are POP ENTERTAINERS. Don't write music, don't play instruments, they just dance and rely on marketing stunts to become big names. Now Liz Phair is an actual musician, talented and extremly sexy without resorting to marketing bull. I feel sorry for people who only know the music mainstream radio plays by corporate America. They will never know real music."
2,Whip-Smart,"I remember this from way back, but the songs aren't like I remember them to have been. I have to skip tracks alot to keep from going insane! All in all, there's still about 5 songs that I really love on the CD."
4,stands the test of time,"The song ""Nashville"" off this album still gives me goosebumps each time I hear it. Her voice overall sounds very cool on this album. ""Whip Smart"" is also a really fun track. I got this in late 1995 as a promo when I worked for a college paper and I still have it in my collection! It's probably the only CD that has survived that long, and I just downloaded it to my itunes -- no scratches, all these years later! thanks Liz! (cool album jacket too)."
4,"Cool ""Whip"".","Even though her debut is considered to be her best album, and I really like ""Whitechocolatespaceegg"", ""Whip Smart"" is my favorite. It could be because ""Supernova"" is one of the best alt-rock songs of all time, but I think it's because the whole album is super. ""Chopsticks"" is a good intro, and ""Support System"" is fun to whistle along with. Then there's some slower tracks like ""Shane"" and ""Nashville"" that are still cool. Not every song is a winner, but overall this sounds as good as she looks. It'll go great with your ""PJ Harvey"" and ""Juliana Hatfield"" cd's."
4,This pop-type recording without the lame pop style lyrics,"Liz Phair has a style all her own. She throws a great song together for the simple lines of chopsticks, yet her lyrics make it so more in depth. She can easliy make her point about relationships, love, and issues, without the same old way of telling it. She inevitably paints vivd pictures of situations with abstract words and phrases. Not your same old love song. Her music captures your attention."
5,Healing and Transformation in this book!,This book transformed my life......I always had difficulty reconciling what I believed with how I was able to live it out as a Christian. I lived with a constant sense of guilt and failure feeling stuck in old patterns of behavior. My prayers seemed to bounce off the ceiling. This book epxplains why we so often have difficulty living the Christian life and how to experience healing and wholeness in our total being. A must for those serious about spiritual growth and prayer. Too bad it is out of print!! This book needs to be re-issued.
5,Use this for English Genealogy work.,I do a lot of Family History and I use this for my English side. Great resource for finding answers to hard questions.
3,Flex Clear Instant Roof Repair,"My high priced patio cover leaks like crazy at the seams. I have tried everything to stop the leaks but so far nothing has worked. I read the information on this product and got it and then read the label and now I know that I need to get the ""mesh"" to properly have the product work. So, now I am going to order the ""mesh"". Then I hope and pray that all of this stuff will work."
4,Yoga for Arthrits,"I have never done any Yoga before,I've found this to be really helpful. It's a good workout and I loved the relaxation portion. Am looking forward to being able to do more and helping to control the stiffnes and pain of my RA.Glenda"
4,New as promised,I love this DVD. It arrived in a reasonable amount of time. It was sealed; I have no complaints.
1,Slow Slow,Do not offer item if you can not ship. 17 to 20 days after I buy is much too long to wait for a shipment. Should disclose this problem as part of the offer.
2,To Easy,"This video is more for chair bound and frail persons. I find a Beginning Yoga class too hard for my age (73), but this is more for the truly disabled."
3,YOGA,"The video is good because it shows you different levels of activity, ages, etc. It's a little slow (as is Yoga) and I have a hard time sitting through the whole thing..."
3,I Like...,"Bought this CD for 2 songs. Lady Marmalade and Sex Cymbal (which are rare and hard to find Sheila E's versions of these songs......but alas, I found it!!!Rick"
4,Bought for my boyfriend...,"My boyfriend loves werewolves. So I saw this series and thought, why not? Well we've both sat and watched about half of it, and we are not in the least bit disappointed! Great for those who love werewolves, and like British tv shows!"
3,Gets Ho-hum,"Starts out engaging but ends up ho-hum. The series changed its name for She-Wolf of London to ""Love and Curses"" most likely to save the series. I am not sure it worked but there are some good moments in the series."
3,"Cheesey, but fun","This series will bring you back to the ""80's in a big way. I do like Forever Knight better, but this was good too."
3,She-wolf,"Vendor was very quick to process and send series. I'm stationed in Iraq,with about 1TB of movies.Found this while looking for anything different. Well this was different,I'm a little suprised it lasted a whole season. If you want to watch a campy 80's werewolf series this is it. After the premier,the wolf thing becomes secondary to the stars becoming paranormal detectives. The Wolf is pretty awful. A wolf's head with hair suit and bare human legs. I'm not going to ask for a refund, because I didn't like the quality. I also wouldn't recomend this for serious werewolf buff's"
3,cheesy but fun....,"i was excited to find the whole series. I remember watching the first few episodes way back when when it was first televised. I'd heard that the show had fizzled and lost its way once they moved it to LA.... but I was pleasantly surprised! did it get a bit farcical and campy? yes, but even the original England-set episodes had their campy moments! all in all worth watching!"
2,She-Wolf of London,"I'm a big fan of werewolf and vampire shows/movies, but I could not get into this series. I was truly disappointed, however, my son loves it. I feel tortured every time he requests that I watch an episode with him. He get's some enjoyment from watching it, so it isn't a complete waste of money. It was just too silly and outlandish. On the plus side, I'm pleased that my purchase price was less than $10 if I recall correctly."
1,Don't waste your money on this rubbish,This show has the worst script and the worst acting of any TV series I've seen. It has all the appeal of a low budget softcore porn movie. I knew it was an old show (1990). I didn't expect it to creak so badly as it moves slowly and unimaginatively from one cliche to the next. Don't waste your time or money on this series
2,didnt realize how old this series was...,"this may be a great series, but when i bought it i didnt realize how old the series was, seems like it was filmed in the 70's or early 80's. dont care for the main character. didnt get very far into it and not interested in watching any more ot if and i am a huge fan of these type of shows! so i was quite dissapointed."
1,Terrible!,"Absolutely dreadful! An eighties/nineties hangover. The characters and plot and are cliché, the acting is terrible, the soundtrack some sort of eighties electro-synth, and the special effects ridiculous!I don't even wish to prolong any longer this review since this series doesn't deserve one, I do wish though I never bought this dvd... I couldn't even get through the third episode."
2,"OH, COME ON!","From what I can remember about this failure of a television series was that it could never settle-down and decide if it was going to be serious or funny.The fact is...it was supposed to be serious, but turned-out so badly that they decided to laugh along with the audience and make in tongue-in-cheek.The ending has the two leads turning into bunnies...right?Or did I dream that?I've tried to ""bury"" this in my memory cells.Nice ""Box Art"", though.Where's ""DARK SKIES'"" box set?We get this crap and no ""DARK SKIES""?"
2,"Love The Songs, No Doubt About It, But Why Are You Releasing Them For The 80 MILLIONTH TIME?!?!?!?","Any true fans of Chaka Khan will avoid this silly rehashing of all the material she has done since 1978! This dosent even belong in her section at all! We all love the music believe me, but Warners and Rhino wanna be cheap. Generic. COST EFFECTIVE.....Even at the cost of one of the most legendary female vocalists of our time! Frankly, Ill say what a lot of us think: Why keep wasting money on these rehashes when you could make money on a nice 4-6 disc boxset with all of her rarities and maybe a nice dvd with some videos and deleted ones? at least release Dare You To Love Me and Chaka Khan (1982)! Chaka Khan dosent deserve this neglect! POWER 2 THE PEOPLE, KEEP PRESSING ON MUSIC LOVERS!!!!!"
5,I really like this cutting board.,"This is the second one that I've had. My first was lost in a move and I was delighted to find a replacement on Amazon. This board is durable, spacious and easy to keep clean. I like that it has little knobs on the back that elevates it slightly above the counter top which makes it easy to move around as needed."
2,A bit flimsy,The rubber nubs underneath this board appear to be well secured and the product arrived in good shape. I would have preferred a heavier construction however. I bought this to straddle my sink so that I could cut and wash all in the same place. The plastic is thinner and bows when I cut veggies. Good design (large) but too flimsy to rate higher. I now just use it for a counter board so that there is support under it.
1,Missing Foot,"Previous Acrylic Plastic Cutting Boards I've bought, came with 9 non-slip feet for stability. The picture of this one on Amazon only shows four, but I bought it anyway, thinking that maybe four is all it needs. When it arrived it only had three feet."
5,Expensive for what you get,"This may be a good board, but my reaction on opening the package was, ""This looks like something I could get at the dollar store. And I paid almost $30 for it??!"" Thought it was very pricey for what you get. This is the first time I've ever been disappointed in an Amazon item and I returned it."
4,Invaluable resource,"This book was developed from the proceedings of the first major professional symposium of aging with a spinal cord injury (held in Denver in 1991). The content is very comprehensive and focuses on different body systems and how normal aging of these systems effects the person with SCI, and how SCI may modify the aging process. While this book was published a number of years ago, it contains most of the research to date, and is based on collaborative data from major SCI centers in both the USA and England. While heavily focused on the medical model, it can be a valuable resource for both professionals working with people with SCI as well as those with SCI and their families."
5,Does what it says,"I now own three of these machines. They keep my, as well as my childrens' lips from chapping. It has even helped my husband with his dry hands. We have force heat in our home and weren't quite prepared for how dry it would feel. These machines are perfect and quiet. Easy to maintain. We run ours 24/7 and clean it every two weeks. One we have had for two years and works just as good as the two new ones."
3,This isn't the children's story,"The children's book of the same title was written by Phyllis Green. This book, published by Kensington Publishers, is a horror story."
5,His greatest '70s album; a harbinger of his album-based work,"The album is a transitional work, but also a masterpiece. ""Jackie Wilson Said"" is a great pop song, in the style of his hits like ""Domino"" and ""Brown-Eyed Girl"". The two long, searching mood pieces, ""Almost Independence Day"" and ""Listen to the Lion"" hearken back to _Astral Weeks_, and look ahead to the next phase of his career, when he abandoned the pop charts in quest of the ""yaarrgh"". The title track is just perfect, the best soul song by a non-American ever waxed. Even the cover art is great--I had the lp cover framed! If you've heard Van on the classic rock station, and would like to dig a little deeper into his catalog beyond the hits, this is the place to start."
5,One of his greatest,"For some reason, this is one of his lesser known works. However, it is comfortably one of the best - alongside Moondance and Astral Weeks. However, the cd remaster is pox. There is no bass. Zip,Zero. Nada. To qualify that comment, I am a bit of an audiophile, use great sounding components - Arcam, Plinius, Magneplanar - and have the album on vinyl. The vinyl sounds great - rich and warm. Why are there no decent remasters of such an important, revered and basically great artist?!?"
2,The Lion Has Little To Say,"Trust me, you are not going to listen to ""Listen to the Lion"" and ""Almost Indepencence Day"" more than once. Van sings these songs and then tries to stretch them out with improvisation and ""scat"" singing. Believe me, Van is no scat singer. He grunts and groans as if he is turning into the lion he sings about. It is pointless and irritating. When someone becomes as respected as Van; his fans start cutting him breaks when he makes bad decisions. I think it should be just the opposite. We should hold him to a higher standard. Most of the music on the CD is either uninspired or self-indulgent. When Van sticks to songs, he's great. When he tries too self-consciously to make ""art"", he fails miserably. Download ""Jackie Wilson Said"" and skip the rest. This is Van at his worst."
4,A winner for 6-8 yr old boys,This book has been very interesting to read together with my 6yr old and 8 yr old sons. Actually my older child listens in too. We have learnt all sorts of interesting things about rainbows and lightning etc. There are some simple activities to go with the information presented to aid with understanding. A great little book.
3,woohoo! go back to the early 90s.,"Wow, what more can i say other than this album sure brought me back to being 7 years old! But I will say that the album does have it's good moments for reflective sounds *Valentine's Day* it's a good song yo!"
5,Fun for kids,"Well I actually purchased the McDonalds cash register which comes with all of these items except the apron, my son loves it and now my 1 yr. old is playing with it. The review about it causing children to get fat is stupid, my kids play with this regularily and they aren't fat..lol.I can't stand when people think a toy is going to screw up a kids way of life! If you feed your kids healthy they will be healthy, playing with fake McDonalds food isn't going to make them unhealthy, are they going to drive themselves to McD's? no.Get over it and let your kids have some fun."
4,Mckiddlet,"I wear this Server Set to work everday & it's very comfortable! No need to bring underwear, I'm covered. The McBurgers taste like the real deal!Although I wish it came with glue-on acne spots, and something to drink, like a coffee.I highly recommend this for all Community College Culinary Arts Majors."
4,Great Accesory,I would recommend this product to any Colts fan looking to show support for their team. Great addition to replace that old license plate cover.
5,Queerly Brilliant,"This book was a fantastic idea to begin with and lives up to its promise. I can't think of a better depiction of junior high school for anybody, gay or straight. I wish they'd do a Queer 14, 15, and keep on going."
4,Out West,"First the Disclaimer: I grew up horseback in SoDak and the Nebraska Panhandle. I saw this movie when it was first released, at the Orpheum Theatre in Aberdeen. When the folks drove us kids to Scottsbluff to visit the kinfolk we always stopped for pie in Pierre at a cafe that had displays of Casey Tibb's stuff.That being said, I think it is a classic period piece.The color and quality are not the best, but that adds to the character. I reckon some people might think the narrative and obviously spliced in wildlife shots are pretty corny, in a ""Wild Kingdom"" sort of a way. And Henry Fonda mispronounces ""Ft. Perre,"" just like everyone else.But if you are into the Great Plains, good horses, and getting Western, this is a good one.There are a number of Really Good shots of lots of horses moving through belly deep grass under a limtless sky.And when was the last time you saw somebody swim his horse across the Missouri River?"
3,Yet Another Upgrade that you Don't Need!,"I like the ""heal"" brush, but this upgrade isn't necessary in order to achieve the same results without it. I noticed several glitches when using the Rubber Stamp tool when you are working close to the edge of the document...it doesn't clone from the precise spot you indicate sometimes and this is VERY annoying (Photoshop 5 is more reliable in this area). I like the larger previews in the Filter windows (they are over twice as large as in Photoshop 5.) The brushes are nice and are easier to select sizes, etc. than previous versions. Overall, the added features are nice, but they aren't necessary and don't justify the upgrade cost. It seems like software is updated now just for the heck of it and the extra money they generate. Adobe should wait until they have something major to add before releasing another upgrade to this program."
5,Linked short stories,"Kieth Robert's novel, ""Pavane"", is an alternate history that reads like literate fiction. Told with linked short-stories ala ""Erdrich's Love"" Medicine or Kincaid's ""Annie JohnP"", this underappreciated classic ended up on Anthony Burgess' list of 99 great novels.Highly recommended"
3,Dreary Alternate History,"PAVANE is made up of six interconnected stories, all taking place in an alternate universe where Elizabeth I was assassinated and the Spanish Armada defeated the British navy, thereby paving the way for the Catholic Church to keep a stranglehold on Europe until the twentieth century.All the stories take place in the gloomy region of Durnovaria, starting in the 1960s and stretching out over thirty years or so, recounting the events which lead up to the final revolt against the Catholic Church. A very interesting concept and well written, but dark and depressing, I had to force myself to finish."
3,"very strong on atmosphere, very weak on plot","I'm usually a sucker for alternate-history novels, and this one is a classic in the field, but I found myself less and less interested in it the more I read it. The first few chapters are quite strong at setting the stage, but after that, though the book is very strong on atmosphere and descriptive plotting, it's extremely thin on plot. This is not ""lean"" writing by any stretch, I would term it much closer to ""rococo""."
2,Maybe better as individual stories than as a whole,"The overall premise is fairly interesting: an alternate version of the world, all resulting from the assassination of Queen Elizabeth I. The book is a collection of short stories set in this world, showing how society functions within the scientific boundaries imposed by the Catholic Church. The individual stories are fairly well-written, especially the first. The big problem for me was my having settled into the premise of the book, and then getting to the end and realizing that things aren't what they seem. While I normally like surprise endings, the particular twist of this one was just too much to accept. I think readers would have a better time with the book A Canticle for Leibowitz, by Walter Miller."
2,Poor,"I was very eager to read this novel after reading numerous wonderful reviews about it in magazines and online, so when I finally bought it I was quite disappointed. Although a very dense and intricate novel, it was ultimately very boring. Even individually, the ""measures"" barely stood up alone as short stories, and together made a poor body of work. The ""twist"" in the Coda makes one wonder whether the preceding stories were a waste of time. Yes, worldbuilding is fun in science fiction, but it does not necessarily make a good novel. I am not surprised that this novel has not achieved a higher status or circulation. It doesn't even have a cult fiction quality to it. Go read something else."
5,Pavane: Keith Roberts,"Pavane is a masterpiece of creative imagination. In this alternative history, Roberts has constructed in graphic detail a late 20th century England that missed the evolution in technology and civil liberty that the industrial revolution stimulated. This is an England whose renaissance was stunted by the victory of the Spanish armada after Elizabeth""s assasination and has endured three centuries of the dictatorship of the Church of the Inquisition, which permitted no more advanced machinery than the steam engine & the most elementary radio.The social mores and the individual personalities that are the result of such an environment are biopsied in Pavane in lucid, plausible detail. & the revolution, when it comes, is messianic as it must be, from a dissenting frior.Keith Roberts is a strong, literate writer. He made me think, my greatest compliment."
5,THE KING...of not only POP....but MUSIC,"Michael Jackson has always amazed and stunned us in more ways than one. His amazing vocal talent that no one compares to, his unbeatable dance moves that no one but himself can do, his some what hectic life style, and just his pure innocence and love for life has made the whole world crazy about him since the day he was born. No one has ever compared to Michael, no does compare to Michael, and I know for a fact that no one ever WILL compare to The KING, MICHEAL JACKSON. This book, like his first autobiography,MOONWALK, will leave you in tears. Before I read MOONWALK, I was not a fan of MJJ. After I finshed the book, I could feel i had changed. This book is no different. Michael means the world to me, and I know so many others who feel the same way too. Read DANCING THE DREAM and meet the REAL MAN IN THE MIRROR!!!"
4,GOOD BOOK,"The book was in good condition, the only thing I was not happy about is that it did not have it's dust cover as pictured. Other then that I was very pleased with the book."
3,It's okay,"You get an insight on Michael jackson. I'm not really interested in poetry and essays but he did have some lyrics from the Dangerous album in it. I don't think he made lyrics that's why I originally liked the book. It just sits on my shelf most of the time though. The pictures are excellent reminders of moments that you might remember seeing in a book, magazine, on t.v. etc. It's cool though, if you want like trivia information or something like that check out a biography or his autobiography."
5,DANCING THE DREAM,"THIS BOOK WAS FANTASTIC!!!!! MR.JACKSON IS,WAS AND ALWAYS WILL BE THE MOST CARING,GENEROUS AND COMPASSIONATE AND LOVING MAN. HIS CHILDREN ARE VERY FORTUNATE TO HAVE A FATHER LIKE HIM. KEEP HIM ALWAYS IN YOUR HEART AND IN YOUR PRAYERS.I ENJOY POETRY VERY MUCH, I ONLY WISH MR.JACKSON HAD WRITTEN MORE BOOKSOF POETRY,THEY WERE BEAUTIFUL, YOU REALIZED HOW MUCH HE CARED AND ALL THE LOVE HE HAD FOR CHILDREN. THIS BOOK IS A MUST FOR ANYONE WHO LIKES POETRY AND IS AT LEAST A LITTLE ROMANTIC AT HEART."
5,Incredible Michael!,"Michael Jackson's dancing the Dream is wonderful. The writings show the side of Micheal that only his true fans knew existed - but now, the world can share his deepest, innermost feelings, his outlook on the world, his love, his talent. What a genius! Loved the book and recommend it to everyone! It is a true tabletop piece.Love you Michael."
2,chic but...,"First, I have to admit the shoes look gorgeous. That is why I ordered them and gave 2 stars here. But it is so difficult for me to walk because the wedge heels lack elasticity so for every step the shoes would slip off the heels of my feet. I kind of feel myself like an acrobat on these high wedge heels. Have to return them although they look beautiful."
1,Sooooo Disappointed!!,"The shoes are great looking, but the heels are very heavy. The style of the top of the shoes is flattering, however, there is nothing to help keep the shoes on my feet. There is no flexability to the heel at all, so when my foot bends...the heel stays down and I walked right out of the shoes. I don't care for ankle straps, but I think this shoe needs something. I usually LOVE the comfort of Nine West shoes, so I was disappointed."
2,OUCH!,"Looks can be deceiving! This shoe is so cute and stylish, but it hurts my foot like crazy. I used shoe stretch, asked my daughter to walk in them, hoping for some kind of relief. The sole is hard an does not bend making me walk very strange and uncomfortable. NOT a walking shoe, but if you want to sit and be cute, nice shoe! Sorry Nine West."
3,Nice look,I bought this backpack for school it sucks it looks great but holds almost none of my books. In addition the single strap is padded but if you have a lot of stuff in there your back feels awful. Bottom line if you are going to use this for short trips and light loads get it if not then don't.
5,Beautiful,Both Delvevante CD's are as beautiful as a warm summer day in the country...Let them take you away!
3,Slickly Produced Country Rock,"The brother duo The Delevantes have obvious talent. Unfortunately, on most of ""Postcards From Along the Way"" that talent seems to have been submerged under a glaze of slick production in what was most likely an attempt by Capital Records to make them radio friendly. As a result, though all of the songs are pleasent enough country rockers, none of them really stand out. At least until the finale, ""John Wayne Lives in Hoboken."" This fine story song still suffers from overly precise production, but the lyrics have a definate impact.Overall, an over-produced country rock album from an apparently defunct band that probably would have been better off recording for an independent label."
4,$250 ?,"Saw Robin live years ago before she became Robin McKelle. Her performmance was stunning. My girl and I bought her CD at the show and played it often. I've sought it out ever since we broke up and she took the CD ~ to no avail. I see it above for an astonishing price, and if I was rich I'd buy it.I hope she or the powers that be reissue it someday, so I can put it back in MY collection where it belongs.A beautiful lady with a beautiful presence and a beautiful voice."
2,Blowing their own horns..again,"All I would want to know is, 'Why'? These guys aren't Finnish but opt to work hard at preserving a form of Finnish folk music, the seven piece brass band. But, the attraction of listening to brass music at the same volume, same format only has just so much appeal. This definitely does not have the polish or precision of their earlier issues. Did they blow too hard? It's a cd eclectic for the eccentric."
1,Really stupid ideas,"I am willing to believe impossible things before breakfast, but not really stupid things.All of the physical science premises of the book are ridiculous. Many of the other premises are silly: The Russians are going to fly an alien space capsule from Southern Russia to California, but only let the US have it for one day? Give me a break.I didn't get past about 50 pages before I threw it away."
2,"ok, but pricey","the earpiece is a bit loose, for the price I figured it would be more secure. Overall, it is a good product"
1,A book for people with tabloid mentality.,"This book is a ""trash-fest"" that should appeal to people who think what is printed in the supermarket tabloids is true. The so-called affair between these two stars is nothing more than an extension of the author's vivid imagination. It is very unfair to trash the reputations of two fine people who have been deceased for more than 30 years and cannot defend themselves, and I found the ""sources"" very questionable."
5,Gift for Mom,My mother could not stop raving about this book. I think it was the best gift I ever gave her. I still love her even though she made me watch ALL of those black and white opera musicals as a kid.
1,This book should be listed under the FICTION section...,"I am a great admirer of both Nelson Eddy and Jeanette macDonald, and I was happy to see a new book about them be published. That was before I read it! This book seems to belong in the FICTION part of the library, as Ms. Rich has done the unforgiveable thing: waiting until practically everyone involved is dead and then writing a trashy ""supposed"" biography. The only good thing I can say about the book is that it has some very nice photographs. Otherwise, I think it is a collection of embellished and fabricated stories."
5,Classic!!!,I love the Yardbirds!!! This is a must have album for all Led Zeppelin and Yardbirds fans. I highly recommend it!!!
2,We want King back...,"This whole Metal Plane thing seemed dumb to me from the beggining, and neither Mr. Mcderrmott, or Mr. Lebow are showing the skill they had in previous books, and are no longer worthy to follow up on a genius like J. Robert King. I don't care what happens to any of these characters, I just want the cycle over so we can move on."
5,IDIOT!!,"CAME ACROSS THIS REFERENCE BOOK BY READING ANOTHER ARTICLE ON LINE..AS WITH MANY, PLAN ON WRITING ONE DAY!!!"
3,The Complete Idiot's Guide to Writing Well,"I thought that this book is a good summary of the requirements necessary to become a good writer. It is simply written, but I think it could elaborate more on the topics. Also, I felt the humor was a little strange. I think that this could be a good start for those interested in learning how to write better."
4,"The best atlas, but has room for improvement","I own several of the DeLorme state atlases. They are great resources for the planning of non-motorized touring (biking, hiking).Strengths include: (1) Physical land features: topographic contours, water resources, vegetation, etc. (2) Off-road options: trails, abandoned railroads, ferries. (3) Recreation: Parks, outdoor sports, points of interest.DeLorme's atlases have two shortcomings: (1) Road naming is too creative. Many of the printed names bear no relation to actual road signs. (2) There's no indication of whether a road is paved, gravel, dirt or sand--every road is shown by a thin, red line. Consult ""The Roads of North Carolina"" for pavement info.All in all, a ""must"" for the do-it-yourself traveler."
2,Nice idea BAD design,"The epilator heads work well BUT there is a HUGE design flaw: the cord plugs in to the side, not the end of the device, which means you really cannot get a decent grip on it. It works OK for underarms, OK for legs and is TOO CLUMSY for anything more delicate ""down there."" I love the product line, wore out my former Gold Touch epilator in the course of 8 years and hoped this model would be just as good. The technology is better: the design is DREADFUL. After 4 months of struggling with it I'm looking for a replacement with a better design."
3,"Emjoi, joy or no joy!","I bought this because I liked emjoi's older eplilator products, which I used to own. Well, this emjoi is a replacement for my older emjoi, and now I wish I kept the older one. The optima is harder to handle, (no grips on it) my hand slips down it all the time turning the unit off, so I have to turn it back on again. I have small hands so I find it harder to manage.Anyways, it does the same job my older one used to do, and I must admit I have gotten used to it."
5,works great,"I purchased my emjoi optima from sharper image for $100. At first it was a little intimidating - It's scarier just getting started than it is painful. The first day I used it it hurt a little, but I got used to it within the first few minutes. It felt as if I was receiving small shocks at first with every hair being pulled, but once I convinced myself that it was hair being tweezed and not shocks I felt a lot less pain! My skin feels so soft and smooth. I opted for using it a day or so after shaving so it was pulling less hair out at a first. I then used it every day for the first week, getting those hairs that were slower growing. I will never go back to shaving again. The underarm area had me scared because so many people said it was so much more painful than the legs, but I found it felt no worse than razor burn when using it at first. Unlike razor burn, though, the discomfort didn't last after I was done removing the hair from that area."
5,Excellent transaction,"I have used this same epilator for several years, and this purchase was because my other one was worn out. For me this product works, does what I need it to do."
4,Overall I am satisfied with purchase,It covers a larger area so it takes half the time. Its a bit uncomfortable to use in curvy location such as underarms and bikini line. However it comes with a sensitive skin shaver attachment which is painless and removes unwanted hair quickly. Can't use this product on face (at least its not recommended.Overall I am satisfied with my purchase.
5,Great epilator but caveat emptor,"I'm now on my third Emjoi Optima Epilator after my previous two stopped operating properly so obviously I think they're great epilators. However, each of my previous two stopped working correctly after about a year and a half, so I highly recommend these epilators with one caveat: expect to receive one to two years of great epilating action but don't be surprised when it stops working after that time."
5,Greatest way to get rid of leg hair,"This product is the best thing since zip up wallets. I love it so much I bought one for my daughter and my sister. No more blood in the shower, and it takes so long for hair to grow back, that when it finally does it's a surprise. I love it!"
5,Love this produce!,I love this product. It really works. The only downside is that it only runs for about a year. I'm now on my fourth one.
2,Bad result,"Optima epilator cuts more than it removes hairs. Plus it didn't catch all hairs. Awful, stay away..."
2,Ouchy Ouchy Boo Boo,"I think I will just start shaving with a machete. This son-of-a-beach hurts. I know some people are into pain (you dirty little sadists!) so you will probably like this thing. I, on the other hand, have sensitive skin to go along with my sensitive soul and couldn't tolerate this devil devise. Be warned, friends. . .be warned."
4,Emjoi AP99 Optima Epilator,I have been using epilators for many years and I find this product to be very easy to use and fast with the new double heads. The only thing that would be an improvement would be a travel bag instead of the nice box in comes in. I also prefer the epilators with a cord because that last one I had the battery didn't last very long. If you haven't tried a epilator in many years you need to try it again. They are not that painful as before. I received my product in a timely manor. I only wish Amazon would take paypal. KRK
4,Works Great,"This is a great hair remover. I am not going to lie it is not painless, but it gets less painful the more you use it. I use it weekly so there is less hair and it is finer. Also, use a exfoliating sponge daily to prevent ingrown hairs. I had an earlier model and it seemed to be a little easier to grip, but this one works fine."
2,High Expectations,"I bought this epilator about 3 months ago and here are my thoughts on it.Pros- saves money on razors- good on large areas- entertaining if you're boredCons- no matter how many times you use it, the pain does not go away (you have to be drunk to use it on your bilini and use tranquilizers to use on your armpits)- ingrown hair can be a problem (especially in the bikini area)- hair doesn't grow back that much slower than shaving (after two day you have to shave anyway to be smooth)- the epilator doesn't pick up fine hair - if it does, it just rips it."
3,"Good product, but only lasts one year.","This shaver is really good for about one year. I use it once every 10 days, but after one year of use, it gets worn out. I wish it would last longer... This is the second time this has happened to my razor..."
4,very nice,"It is grate she loves it, it dose what it clams, I will recommenced to others. good items to have"
3,Emjoi AP99 Optima,"A good product overall, but didn't like the following things about the product:1> The charging chord is a little short than my previous Braun Epilator.2> The charger is a heavy one compared to the one from Braun.3> The charging chord connects at an uneasy place on the Epilator; this causes the handling of the epilator a little difficult especially if they are on the sensitive areas of the body. We wish the chord was connected like in other Epilators at the rear."
5,The Best Epilator...,"It is indeed the best epilator ever, I had it many years ago and last for many years too, and was very happy with the product and the result...I decided to try a different epilator product recently and was very disappointed, then I AM SO GLAD TO PURCHACE A NEW ""EMJOI"" EPILATOR AGAIN TO HAVE THAT EXCELLENT EXPERIENCE AGAIN.Thank you Amazon!Sha, California"
2,Won't Last Long...,I've being using Emjoi for the past 7 years and they work great at the beginning but for some reason they start loosing speed until they die completely. This is probably the reason why they only give a one year warranty.
2,works okay but not worth the money,I found that the optima generally broke off the hair on my legs more often than it removed it from the root. This results in a need to either shave or use the epilator again within a short period of time. I also found that it wouldn't even pick up some hairs despite my going over the area repeatedly. Overall I had hoped that this would replace shaving which it hasn't so it was generally just a waste of money.
1,"INCONSISTENT, WILL NOT BUY AGAIN","While I found the device to be somewhat effective in removing hair (I did eventually grow accustomed to the sensation and it did indeed become much less painful than the first experience), I found that the rotating tweezers would break down and stop spinning after just a few months. I foolishly thought I would give it another try, so I bought another one and the same problem occurred. I might add that I noticed that the best results would occur when the product was new, and that it actually seemed to gradually spin more and more slowly over the course of use, until it actually just stopped working just a few months later. Perhaps my experience is unique, but I will certainly not buy the Optima again."
5,Worth it,"Hurts like #$$%^ Worth the pain. I don't have to sahve under my arms for 2 weeks!!!! Love it. Still hurts never got used to it. But 2 weeks, I think it's worth it."
5,Good for sensitvie skin,"I read so many reviews before buying this product and there wasn't many out there about sensitive skin. I decided to give it a try and if it didn't work I'd send it back. I'M IN LOVE. I works wonderfully. The first couple times I used it I only did small sections, I wanted to see if I would break out in rashes, which I do when shaving(no matter what I've tried). I had the red bumps at first but they were gone within a hour. With shaving I would have to shave every two days or the hair would irritate my skin. I actually got lazy an went two weeks, and it did not bother me!!!"
3,Not Great on Legs,"This epilator is the only one I have tried. It does well on the bikini area, but the legs is where it's not great for me. It seems to break a lot of the hair off rather than remove it from the root. I don't know if the hair needs to be longer before I remove it, but if it has to get THAT long then what's the point??"
4,Awesome!,"I received my epilator approx. two weeks ago. I wish I would have known about this years ago as a teen. I would have prevented cuts and several scars from shaving, not metion having to shave everyday to keep smooth (hair free) legs, bikini and underarms. I agree with most reviews, it does hurt at first. I was able to tolerate it. No worse than waxing, at least you know it comes off the first time, unlike waxing that sometimes sticks and does not come off-ouch. Advice: let your hair grow out a bit to make sure you get all of it, it pulls it from the root. I removed the bikini area, legs and underarms. It's been a 7 days and I have not had to use the epilator since. The legs is a bit different. I have had to use it every other day on the ones that grow unevenly. Absolutely worth every penny! The hair that is growing back is smoother and finer. I really like it."
2,Poor Ergonomics,"I've used a few other ""epilators"" and I liked this one least for several reasons. I found the tweezing plates revolving in 2 directions, as opposed to one, rather uncomfortable. Also, the plastic pieces at ends (bordering the tweezers) were sharp and often scratched my skin. The biggest reason that I don't care for this product is it's size and shape. It's small and thick and difficult to hold comfortably, often grazing my fingers during use. While this wasn't painful it was certainly annoying. Of the products commonly found on the market, I prefer the emjoi ""Gold Caress."" It's easier to hold and use, and it's less expensive. (The Gold Caress, however, doesn't include a shaving head.)With this model you also have the choice of AC or rechargeable. Hope this helps."
4,No more shaving!,I love this product! I was so sick of shaving that I decided to give this a try. I have a low pain tolorance and I have to say that it did hurt ALOT the first 2 times. (I admit I had a glass or two of wine before doing it the second time lol) but after that the hair is much finer and since it grows back at different speeds its not as concetraited in one area...which is why it hurts. I use this all the time now. My legs are soooo smooth. I usually do this once a week while watching tv. It actually lasts for 3/4 weeks or so however since hair grows back at different speeds and depending upon how much of the hair was taken out by the root or if it just broke off I like to use it weekly. It doesnt hurt at all now...although I read someone used this on their underarms. I tried it and will NEVER do that again...that was painful!!! the bikini line is less painful than that. This product works great and I'll never go back to shaving!!!
3,does the job,"The emjoi has no joy involved, but it does most of the job. You have to get used to the feeling of it. It also takes a few times of going over the same spot before it gets everything. I still can't do the entire leg, too painful. But, for quick, do it yourself hair removal, I still recommend it. Just remember to exfoliate ladies!"
2,Emjoi Optima is VERY VERY painful!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I am a 24 year old male in great shape(just so you all know im no wimp). When I used the trimmer on my Arms the pain was so bad I about passed out(not joking). This may work out better for womens legs because their legs are used to being shaved so the skin is much tougher. It will irritate your skin(similar to when you get waxed: red bumps). It for the most part removes the hair at the root. I myself am going to stick to waxing/Nair. It is much less painful and MUCH Much faster. I would recommend taking some pain pills prior to trying this it will make it much more pleasant. If you do decide to buy one then make sure that you are able to return it for a refund in case it hurts you as badly as it did me. Hope this helps you all out.
1,Emjoi AP99 Opitma Epilator - Torture Treatment,"This product may be exactly what it is supposed to be, however I used it for aproximately 2 minutes and could not stand it any longer. Despite the fact that I followed the directions given for maximum efficiency and for least amount of pain, it was extremely painful. The amount of hair that was removed was almost unnoticable and I was bleeding to the point that it was on the epilator. If more hair had been removed I might have suffered through but it was clear it would have taken at least an hour or more to complete the process. I was unwillingly to endure the pain for that long. My hair was not extremely long and so this could not have been the problem.Again, the product may be a good one, maybe it is supposed to hurt this much. My pain tolerance is fairly good. I have had several surgeries and managed high pain levels with minimal pain meds. I cannot imagine anyone enduring the epilator process though. Waxing never sounded so good."
3,Emjoi AP99 Optima Epilator,I did not purchase this product on December of 2006. The product was purchased ealier that year but failed so I had to get a replacement since it was still under the warranty period. It works fine at the moment but I am not sure how reliable it is overall.
3,Great idea!,"I bought this product a few months ago to use on my upper lip. I'm still waxxing, I just can't get myself to use this thing. I've tried several times, but dang it looks like it's going to chew me up and spit me out! Maybe someday. I feel I wasted my money for now. I did investigate the different epilators and this one rated as one of the best, especially for the money. Good luck!"
5,Works great -- Less hair!,"I have tried several different products to tweeze the hair from my underarms and legs. This is the best product I have used. It is far from painless, but it is also effective and quick. I feel confident enough to use it on the delicate skin under my arms and know that I won't hurt myself. I have worn two of these out over the years and given others as gifts. I rate this as highly as possible. Forget razors. Forget the splashy ads that tell you that their product works under water (it doesn't, I own it), or a spring works (it doesn't, I own it), or a sanding disk works (it doesn't, I own it, and you don't want to see my legs after that fiasco!), or a green gel from Down Under will pull your hair off (it didn't pull the hair but it did pull the skin!). This is a good product, sturdily made, that will last for years."
4,Emjoi,This is my second epilator. I wore out the first one because I used it for years. I don't shave my legs. I use the epilator and the leg hair has thinned and is easier to maintain a smooth touch.
3,Stopped working after 1 week,"Emjoi is a great epilator but I gave it 3 stars because it is not comfortable to hold and it quit working after 1 week. The product works great for it's purpose, I would love more it if it had a better way to handle- it's a little small. That aside I will continue to use until I find a better product. Amazon quickly replaced the broken one- I am pleased with Amazons customer service!"
3,State sales tax on Postage?,"I do not know about this particular product but someone needs to inform SI that charging state sales tax on federal postage rates is illegal. I am curious if the states have been collecting this illegal tax. Yes, I called SI and was told that not only are you charged state sales tax for handling but also for the postage as it says when one checkouts, and since states do not charge sales tax on stamps I am curious where this money has been going all these years."
3,Is this the way to go?,"I currently use products like NAIR to remove facial hair on my upper lip and side-burn areas. I think that it's effective, but I'm in those teenage years where if I put oil on my face I break out! I was wondering if this product would be better being that it doesn't include putting oil on your face or will it give you bad in-grown hairs? Also I was a little confused- It's not like shaving right? More like plucking? I would really appreciate a response, Thanks!"
4,lightening fast,"I have owned other epilators before, and this one is definitely the best. It does the job twice as fast as any other. I usually took me about 20 minutes, and I did it in less than 10. I gave it only four stars because the shape is not all that great. It is somewhat difficult to hold because it is so different from other epilators. But eventually you probably get used to it. Also, the packaging is too much, and it is not easy to put the cord away, and it is not portable. I wish it came in a zipped pouch like most of the others do. But overall, I am very happy wiht the way it performs. It is the best epilator I have owned."
5,Excellent product,"You need to have courage or a margaritta before you do this, becuase it does hurt the first time- but after that its a breeze. Long lasting results. Highly recommended."
4,Good Value and Protection,"This is a great sunscreen and a good price. It contains Parasol 1789 (avobenzone) which protects against the upper UVA spectrum that many sunscreens dont, even if they say they are broad-spectrum. The only effective uva blockers that are FDA approved are avobenzone, titanium dioxide, and zinc oxide."
5,Local and global go hand in hand,"Thinking locally and acting globally, or vice versa, are not any new Web-slogans.This book published in 1987, already connected the threads of what is local (physical, personal touch) to global (biological, physiological, and metaphysical).The book ends with its primary thesis:Between experiencing cosmic joy and alleviating local pain there is a path that each can follow. It it is a narrow path, it is at least wide enough to walk on, just like the finger pier I am now about to traverse, beginning the return from cosmic concerns to the responsibilities ahead"" (p. 303)."
3,Good as a webcam. Horrible as a digital camera,"I've had the Clicksmart 510 for about a year now.My main use for this camera is mostly as a webcam.The quality is really good if used as a webcam.If using it as a digital camera, the quality is horrible. Using excessive light might do it some justice. Batteries last a long time with this camera as well."
5,Definitely a classic,I lot of people slept on this album. This one of the only few albums that I have bought that every song is tight. Grand Daddy I.U really did his thing on this album and I got to give it up to Biz Markie on the production side. I totally again with one of the reviewers this album has to be re-release to show these new head listener what a good album suppose to be like. A must have for everyone and a definite classic.
5,Great product,Super fast delivery and great product. My kids love this poster...it helps them with their math homework. I hung it in the room.
3,Ok not the best !,"I ordered this product to help my 5 yr old learn and recognize her numbers .. So when I received it I was excited but first of all the shipping sucked , the poster was rolled into this tube and was so hard to take out because it was all wrinkled and after at least 10 minutesOf tugging on the tube I finally got it out only to be a lil more disappointed ... I was not laminated ... Product says its laminated but it's not !!! She still uses it and she is learning except some of the numbers she can't really see because of the damage that was caused while trying to unpackage :( .... If only it was laminated this would have been a different story ."
3,Missing Episode!,"The first episode listed on the first disk, AUTUMN WOODS, is NOT on the disc. The second episode listed, Winter Frost, is on the disc twice, shown as both the first AND the second episode.Since I bought this set primarily for the Autumn paintings, you can imagine my disappointment. I guess I'll have to contact the Bob Ross company to see if they will make this right. I doubt Amazon can do anything about it.I haven't yet checked every episode. The ones I have watched are the same Bob Ross shows you've enjoyed on tv."
5,Excellent look from the Defense prospective,"I have enjoyed true crime books for many years, and this is the best I've read. Seeing what went on behind the scenes, the considerations of the defense attorneys, dealing with a serial killer on a daily basis, attempts to look inside Ridgeway, the toll it took on those involved in the investigation and defense, all make for fascinating reading."
1,The Incredible Lightness of Being a Defense Attorney,Any defense attorney who finds room to include more than one full-size photo of himself in swim trunks while consigning the photos of some of the Green River killer's victims to thumbnail-sized rows squeezed into two horrifying pages (noting that several other victims' photos have simply been left out) is perhaps not as much a victim of bad media and resentful families as he depicts himself here. The very premise of the book seems to be that it is Prothero and the Green River Killer himself -- and not the raped and murdered women -- who are to be pitied for being misunderstood. Morally repulsive and embarassingly self-indulgent.
3,It's good,"This book is really fairly good at introducing easy to remember math solutions. The author takes nothing for granted and teaches from the beginning so that you may ""learn"" the material. The only down fall is that there are a couple of type-os in the algebra section answers which really drove me crazy second guessing myself. Fortunately for me, I work with engineers who confirmed my answers. Having said that, the book redeems itself with usefulness. I give 3 1/2 stars."
4,Math for Dummies,I found this book very helpful! My math skills have never been stellar so when I decided to brush up....I got this little book which is full of useful tips and hints to make math a bit easier!! Highly recommended!!
2,Bee Careful,"Buyer Beeware, I bought the 2 part DVD package thinking this was more of a documentary or ""how to"" from New Frontiers. It is a recording of a 3 hour seminar that covers very advanced subjects in advanced beekeeping. It was fair production value at best and very dry material."
3,A Mixed bag,"""Mutineer"" contains some great Zevon songs. ""Seminole Bingo"" is a funny story of a ""junk bond king"" who falls for bingo in Florida. ""The Indifference of Heaven"" tells us the story of a life where ""nothing is left but the sound of the front door closing forever."" ""Piano Fighter"" starts us off with a toy piano and has fun describing a man addicted to making music no matter what. These great tunes are surrounded by some odd tales of unhappy clowns, pirate symbolism that just isn't clear to me, and finally ""Monkey Wash, Donkey Rinse"" which appears some sort apocalyptic statement that I'm willing to admit left me puzzled. Worth it for the good stuff."
4,Up and Down,"Certainly not WZ's best, but enough good stuff to make it part of your collection. Lyrics are chock-full of humor, wit, irony, and occasional tenderness as usual. ""Indifference of Heaven"" is a masterpiece, but I think the live version on ""Learning to Flinch"" is more powerful. Same can be said of the ""LTF"" rendition of ""Piano Fighter"", compared to this over-arranged yet ragged studio version. Beyond that ""Seminole Bingo"", ""Poisonous Lookalike"", and ""Monkey Wash Donkey Rinse"" are solid compositions lyrically and musically. The rest of the tunes have excellent lyrics but are musically rather flat."
3,A 3-star Warren disc is better than what's on the radio,"A good Warren disc but not particularly strong compared to others. Five of ten songs are really pretty good: Seminole Bingo, Indifference Of Heaven, Piano Fighter, Rottweiler Blues, and Mutineer. The whole disc has an unfinished feel to it, which I found lacking here. On Life'll Kill Ya, the production works much better because of the more personal nature of the whole disc, so you might want to try Life'll Kill Ya first.Still, Warren Zevon is one of my favorites, and one of the few artists whose disc I will buy without hearing anything from it first. Mutineer doesn't change that."
4,Still strong material.,"""Mutineer"" Did not chart (1995).As more and more fans left the fold with each release, Warren gave us another strong platter. 3 of the songs came from his 1993 live disc ""Learning To Flinch"". ""The Indifference Of Heaven"", ""Piano Fighter"", great song and ""Poisonous Lookalike"". The title track is a winner as is ""Monkey Wash Donkey Rinse"", two other tunes also struck a chord in ""Something Bad Happened To A Clown"" and ""Rottweiler Blues"". In five years, Warren would release his last 5 star album in ""Life'll Kill Ya""."
3,disappointing,"I'd agree with some of the other Zevon fans who were disappointed with this album. Overall, I think it's one of Zevon's weaker offerings. I'm a huge Zevon fan, and I've also read every one of Carl Hiaasen's books (very, very funny stuff), which perhaps hightened my expectations of this album. A good idea that just didn't click."
1,A rare weak offering from Warren,"I consider myself to a be huge WZ fan and for me, this one just doesn't stand up. Relatively speaking (everything is relevant, right?), Mutineer is nowhere near as good as Exitable Boy, The Envoy, Sentimental Hygeine, and other masterpieces from Warren. Highlights are Seminole Bingo (in the mold of classic Zevon), and the poignant Indifference of Heaven. On a good day, I may find Something Bad Happened to a Clown amusing, but otherwise, not much here.Sorry Warren. You were the best!!"
3,One Oar In The Water,"This was Zevon's least interesting album. His rascal wit is sheathed and a couple of the songs are complete throwaways. That is not to say that his usual tendencies are completely buried, since this CD opens with the funny ""Seminole Bingo"" and closes with the brilliant title track. Unfortunately, you have to sit through the puzzlingly awkward ""Something Bad Happened To a Clown"" and ""Jesus Was a Cross Maker"" (which he didn't even write). Most of ""Mutineer"" sounds like his heart really wasn't much in it.The best of the rest, ""Piano Fighter"" and ""The Vast Indifference Of Heaven,"" make for better than average listening. If you are looking for prime Warren Zevon, start with ""Genius,"" ""Excitable Boy,"" ""The Wind"" or ""Sentimental Hygiene."""
3,The 'b-sides' from the 1940's,"Not quite as fresh as the previous volume - ""Archie Americana: Best of the Forties, Book 1,"" but still a must read for the die-hard Archie afficionado. While Book 1 was lovingly crafted to showcase material with historic value (e.g. - the first appearance of key characters, locations, etc.), Book 2 comes across a bit more lightweight in comparison as the stories seem selected more for the zaniness of its humor and the timeframe that the stories were selected from (1946-1949) seems somewhat narrower. Still, this being Archie comics and all, it still manages to be an enjoyable read all the way through, but do make sure that you read/purchase Book 1 first."
3,If Nostalgia is your compelling need....,"...then you will enjoy this for about an hour and then pass it around to old - I mean old - friends.It's kind of like cotton candy -sweet and ephemeral. Good color, okay story selection, you get to know Mr. Andrews, his father."
4,David Lee is a Rocker,I must admit that back when Van Halen and David Lee Roth split I sided with Van Halen and became a Sammy Hagar fan as well. Since then I've gone back and listened to the old David Lee Roth stuff and I'm impressed. In my opinion he had one of the best voices in rock ever.
3,DLR and the last resort CD.,"With the breakup of VH, DLR started out well and big with his firstalbum. The more he made the worse it got. Title track is great but falls off after that."
4,great disk but...,"i think the re-mastered version sounds better although it may sound too much like van halen for some. this disk is the same musically but sonically, i liked the remaster better."
1,Not George's Best Work,Not the best work by George and the Destroyers. Probably would have been better served to release as an EP. Last half dozen tracks wouldn't even have been suitable B-Sides. First half is decent Thorogood material.
3,Expensive,"The content is without question five star, however the fact that there is no copyright on the original material means that a number of persons have done their own variation of it. Amazon sells three versions of this work. This one has some alterations to the original work to try to make it a little more consistent with his knowledge of the Bahamas, mostly wording. Sealey has has also corrected some proof errors in the original and done some other editing. My complaint is that it is simply too expensive. Buy the other versions on Amazon they are less costly. These are photo copies of the original and cost less than the used versions of Sealey's book. I still have to complete my reading of each of them and I will update my comments should I feel there is some additional information that would be useful."
3,Great Chicago-Style Blues,We used to go see Pappa Chubby when he fronted the house band at Manny's Car Wash in NYC for the Sunday night blues jam (part of which can be heard on this disk). He plays with passion and hard (he breaks a lot of strings) and sweats in your beer from the stage as he pounds out electric blues.
1,Title Misrepresents Product,"The product title says ""5 Deck Boxes in White"" and $9.00 for 5 would be a very good price, but it's a lie. They in fact send only 1 deck box. Shipping this back for a $9.00 refund would be a waste of my time, but if you're looking at this product page be warned."
4,Holds up ok,"These boxes are ok. They stay shut pretty well and survive a little abuse in a bag. However, after several opens they start to wear and the hinges crack."
2,Disappointing Novelty Item,"This is, as it claims to be, a novelty item. After the first use, the metallic finish was visibly chipping off. Although the vibrator worked fine, there is not a wide range of possibilities. It also requires 2 size ""N"" batteries (included) which I have no idea where to buy from after these run out. I wish I had read the fine print!"
3,Exotica Made Into Celluloid,"Although Jame's L wolcott's bizarre film will NEVER be seen as anything but a campy joke, I actually found it kind of cute. The ""story"" as such revolves around the men of Wongo being rather plain, but the women attractive, and the men of Goona, being a bunch of bronzed ""Bo-Hunks"" in leotards, but the women being plain....you get the idea.It is like a cheesy slice of ""exotica"" music, done as a late 50's jungle/beach romp, with absolutely terrible ""acting"" literally the worst I think I've ever seen, and the most stilted and ludicrous dialogue ever written, complete with the dumbest, most atrocious story as well. B grade, more like zilch, but it is still fun, with some nice underwater shots of the girls to boot.A classic of BAD cinema!"
4,AN ADMIREABLE TRIBUTE TO JOHNSON'S WORK,"I'VE ONLY HAD A FEW EASYDISC CDS THAT I CONSIDER A ""BELL RINGER""....THIS IS ONE OF THEM. I'M A BLUES MUSICIAN AND LOVE THE SOUND OF THE SLIDE GUITAR. ALL THE ARTISTS ON THIS CD GIVE AN ACCURATE TRIBUTE TO JOHNSON'S STYLE OF SLIDE. I USUALLY DON'T CARE TOO MUCH FOR CDS THAT HAVE THE SAME ARTIST DOING MORE THAN ONE SONG...JOHNNY SHINES, JOHN HAMMOND AND RORY BLOCK ALL COVER 3 SONGS APIECE...BUT THEY DO IT SO WELL THAT IT DOESN'T AFFECT THE ESSENCE OF THIS WORK AT ALL. PAUL RISHELL, KRISTINA OLSEN AND BOB BROZMEN COMPLETE THE REMAINDER OF THE 12 TRACKS. OLSEN AND BROZMEN ARE NOT WELL KNOWN BLUES ARTISTS, BUT STAND RIGHT UP TO THE REST ON THIS CD. MY FAVORITES ARE TRACKS 3, 5 AND 12. I GAVE THIS CD A 4 STAR RATING. IF YOU ARE A FAN OF ROBERT JOHNSON AND SLIDE GUITAR, YOU WILL REALLY DIG THIS CD. JERSEY SLIM"
1,We passed on these,"After looking at these Imaginarium blocks up close, we passed on these and bought the (albeit more expensive) blocks from Uncle Goose. The type face is Courier, and the odd letter distribution makes constructing words hard. The colors were very nice, but these also had a lightweight feel to them. The Uncle Goose blocks, however, are made of hardwood, have a classic design, animal pictures and names, and chew proof paint! We've been very pleased, and notice that friends who've bought these Imaginarium blocks always ask us about our Uncle Goose blocks."
2,Ok for adults,"It's rather difficult to grasp what the author is talking about, due to the fact that she does not include very many details on how to put the characters together, or how much clay to use. It's pretty difficult for kids since the projects are very specialized and involve A LOT of clay for anyone who's not a ""professional"" hobbyist. It's good for getting ideas or checking the basics but I would not recommend this book for the projects or for a novice, like me."
3,fun,Love the book and the pictures but the instruction lack dimensions of how to make the characters. Love it though and have made a couple of the characters. Love the story about the dragon that lost it's scales
4,Great book for kids,"I just got this book today. I love the pictures, so vivid. I think kids will love this book so long as there is an adult around who can help them finish the project. I would have given this book a 5 star, but some details are left out of each project. I do like the fact the book does show the use of toothpicks to hold up parts of the sculptures."
4,suitable for all ages,"This was my first ever polymer clay book I was very pleased with it. It is suitable for the young or the young at heart. (Especially mothers with toddlers/young children, something to do on a rainy afternoon!)"
4,Fun place to start.,"My 8 y.o. daughter and I are on cat #3 in her planned family of 5. I agree with other opinions that there could be a little more details, but we're adaptable sort of folks, so we just ran with it and used our imaginations. Other figure books are too detailed in sculpting for kids so I think this is a great place for a kid to start especially as a project to share with a grownup."
2,"Ok, but lacking in details","I've worked with polymer clay for a few years, but found this book to be lacking in step by step details to make the characters. The directions for each character are vague and leave most of the steps in getting the design up to the sculptor.The pictures and story are cute, but I think some of the other artists write better directions for replicating their designs. Other artists include amount of clay needed, how to add character and details to the clay so the final result is more professional."
3,Okley Dokley,"Hearing this seminal 90's indie rock band at their most unhinged can be both a blessing and a curse, as many outstanding fragments can fade into a general haze of academic debauchery."
5,pavement's worst album? whatever. this album rocks,"Steve Malkmus is the Pablo Picasso of songwriting. The way his obscure, fragmented lines mirror the guitar and the sophisticated arrangement of his songs are unmatched by any artist today... Wowie zOWIE is a rock and roll masterpiece."
5,Silly critics.,"Despite the favorable blurbs quoted above, rock critics didn't seem to care much for this album. That's their problem. This is the band's most eclectic album to date, and there's nothing wrong with it. Fuzzy stomping rockers (""Serpentine Pad""), sprawling epics (""Half a Canyon""), lazy chimers (""Motion Suggests"") and even some steel guitar for good measure (""Father to a Sister of Thought"") Just buy it."
4,tough love,"this is not an easy record to like, but like it you will. in fact, you may even worship it. because it's a beast of a record: brave, stupid, baffling and brilliant. someone below compared it to the White Album, but no: it's more like an updated Exile on Main St. -- sinister undertones and all...."
4,The best uneven album in recent memory,"Rarely has an album whose quality flucutates so dramatically sounded so indespensable, so fascinating. You know the boys in Pavement aren't druggies, but they sure do a convincing interpretation here. This album goes all over the place. Part Exile on Main Street, part Tusk, part London Calling, part Zen Arcade and a lot Pavement, Wowee Zowee keeps you listening or consciously ignoring, depending upon your disposition. Ten to 15 years out, when critics look back at the 90s through the lenses of a crazy, new millenium, they will make special mention of this one."
1,"Another poser, dangerous product avoid",A load of blarney like all this posers's drivel. Keep your money and buy a half pint. The memory lasts longer and make better sense.
4,Nice and warm!,"I am a utility meter reader and have to do plenty of walking in my boots. These are nice and warm, even with thin socks. I wish they had a bit more support, but as boots go, they do have more support than most I've tried. Also, I have very wide feet and would have preferred to have the boots in ""wide"" width if they had been offered, but I am managing OK with the ""average"" width."
5,warm and light,These are the most comfortable boots I have ever had. They keep my feet dry and they are very easy to walk in.
3,If they were comfortable they'd be perfect,"I got these boots for Christmas as I requested on my wish list and they keep my feet warm and toasty dry. The only complaint I have is they feel stiff to me and don't flex enough. They hurt the top of my feet if I wear them snowshoeing or walking for more than just a few minutes at a time. It's like they have no ""give"" to them. For taking the kids out to play or shovelling they work just fine."
3,CD -- New or Used?,"I ordered this CD as a gift. It arrived without ANY shrinkwrap or normal security packaging. I'm sure the recipient thought I was passing along an old CD. When he opened the gift, I was there. We were both surprised. It played just fine (thank goodness!).So, did I buy a USED product at a NEW price?I felt so embarrassed (and duped by Amazon)."
2,Very good except the range is terrible,"This phone is almost perfect. It has all the features you might want, is easy to use, and priced reasonably.Unfortunantly, it has the smallest range of any cordless phone I've ever tried. Even 15 feet from the base station my reception isn't perfect. At 75 feet it is unusable.Two caveats: I haven't checked the manual to see if there is a magic incantation that's required to get it to work properly. I have only played with two base stations and three handsets so I may have just had bad luck."
5,"nights, seeds...","the winged seed is probably the most poetic book i have ever read. li-young lee's quiet, condensed writing style is almost sedating. he is one of the most interesting people i've met and one of the best poets i've ever read. he is what many poets strive to be."
4,great tonneau cover,"I purchased this cover after comparring a few brands and models in the same price category. the feature i like is all steel or aluminum construcion as oposed to others that had plastic clamps. at first i wanted the tri fold. but choose the seal and peel. because of practicality. the folding feature seemed nice, except anything put there in. would have to fit with cover closed. only advantage is access from front or rear. anything i want to fit in, i just slide in, w/ tailgate open. leaving cover alone. happy with the covers material, seems real rugged. installed in winter and it went on ok. i would suggest insatlling on sunny day though. rails and bows are strong, and again clamps are metal not plastic."
4,Great book for children learning English,"Even though she does not fall within the age range for this book, I think Touch and Feel Colors has been a great book for our 9-month-old daughter.Our daughter is internationally adopted and we are trying to get her used to hearing the English language. Touch and Feel Colors has large pictures of easily identifiable items in vibrant colors that catch our daughter's attention. While she looks at the pictures, my husband and I can point and repeat different words so that she can start to make the associations.She does not quite understand the ""touch and feel"" aspect of the book, but I think that will help to keep the experience fresh and engaging as she gets older. Older children would also benefit from the critical thinking opportunities for each color. For example, the page with the color brown asks ""how many brown animals can you name?""I think this is a great book that will continue to grow with us and I recommend it as a great introduction to colors."
1,Terrible Mix,"The mix on this package of CD's is horrible -- if you have a decent stereo you will get a headache from the kick drum, which is so far forward in the mix it dominates thoughout. More prominent than Dave's voice, more prominent by far than the bass guitar, more prominent than anything else. It is like listing to the band with your head 3 feet from the kick drum. Thud, thud, thud, thud (etc.). I like Dave, but I couldn't listen to all 4 CD's because of the kick drum. James"
5,SOOOOO GOOOOOOOOOD,Have ever single dave cd every made and this one is by far one of the best ones. The quality and sounds are so good its like your right there listening to him. Dave is one of the best of all time and if you like dave then this is a essential to your dave collection.
3,"Not their best, but not horrible","I have every album these guys have put out, and I must admit I was a but dissapointed when I listened to this concert. The thing about DMB is that they are always changing and trying new things. The addition of Rashawn Ross is great for the new songs, but hearing him play on the old songs takes some getting used to. Out of all the songs my favorite would have to be ""Break Free."" It is by far their best new song in a long time. Another problem with this show is that they made separate tracks for some of the songs that lead into other songs. I like to hear ""Pantala Naga Pampa"" go right into ""Rapunzel"" and ""So Much to Say"" go into ""Anyone seen the Bridge."" If you have it on an MP3 player it doesn't flow all that well. If you want a really good concert pick up ""Live at Central Park,"" it's their best live album outside of the Live Trax Series."
5,Excellent!,"The cds weren't for me, they were bought as a gift, but I am continuously reminded of how good they are! I am told it is their best live cd to date."
5,Excellent!! Excellent!!!,"This Live Trax Collection is amazing, and this one is the best!!!!!! DMb is growing up everyday.."
1,Herbert Armstrong -- Church of god,You will be puzzled by this book until you find out that this is a rehash of the slanted perspective of Herbert Armstrong.
2,Don't waste your money,"I rushed into buying this book, but later checked the wrioter out online and foudn him to be a cultist and a date setter. This past week, he was on the news beign brought up on criminal charges! ARRAGGGHHHH!"
4,Must have!,"If your into ""End-Time"" prophesies, this is an excellent book to read and have in your Library.I have already recommended it to my friends."
1,false,"this book is full of lies and deceit, we can not know the day or hour of our Lord Jesus immenant return.we can know the season and we are in it from all that is going on in the world."
2,prophesy review,I found this author's opinions too far off from Bible scholars who have studied over the span of hundreds of years.
4,refund policy,"I was wondering if there is a refund policy if the world does not end this year. Also wondering what is to become of the money he makes off of the book if the USA goes under the money will have no value. One editorial comment concerning the content. He states the the end of the world, WWIII is man created. If this was foretold thousands of years ago how can it be caused by people who were not even alive at the time? Perhaps everything is the result of a prior state of mankind and like the inertia of a spinning wheel and thus the end time is just the conclusion of an inevitable chain of events to mix my metaphors. My advise , don""t sell your time shares."
1,Worthless Trash!,I gave this book one star only because I could not give it zero. Rehashed garbage that isn't worth the ink and paper to print it. Anyone giving Weinstein any credence is not a reasoning person.
5,Great cooking show!,"I love Pepin, the cooking is direct and amazing. The video is very clear and watching the episodes makes me hungry!"
5,Masterful,"Jacques Pépin's expertise is displayed beautifully in this comprehensive segment. The recipes range, as he says, from simple to elegant -- each of them coming alive and easily replicated, thanks to his informative commentary. He is the ideal host for one of these shows and this series has quickly become one of my favorites."
5,Jacques Pepin is my favorite Chef!!!!,I love Jacques Pepin. He is my favorite french snob. I love his personality and his cookingtechniques are amazing! I highly recommend anyof his videos. He will teach you how to makeTibetan pan bread in 15 minutes. Amazing!His techniques for fast easy loaves of bread areimportant to learn in todays economy.Wonderful chef!
5,Works Beautifully!,"These are great radios especially for the price. I ended up buying these after my Motorola T289's both broke almost on the same day after haivng had them only a year. The charging base and the price on this set is what attracted me most, and I am very happy with the product!"
2,dissapointed,"These radios do not actually have 38 sub codes, clip fell off while in use, did not work after lying in suitcase. Not worth money."
2,They are not too good... 2 mile range??? I don't think so.,The radio is compact but it does not have 2-mile range. It is about only one mile range. And the channels have interferences with other radios.
1,Incorrectly advertised,"I purchased this 2-way radio to use in my office. I need the 38 CTCSS subcodes per channel, since we are near a highway and frequently get interference from other users. Though Amazon.com indicated this unit had this capability, it did not. I now must go to the trouble of returning it. I would not have ordered this 2-way radio if representation of this product's features were correct."
4,What's done in the dark,O my God I really laugh in watching that DVD it contents a lot of moral lesson in it. And I stongly recommend you to buy it you won't regret if you are someone who takes time to listen and learn through comedy. God bless
4,THE PLAY WAS GOOD EXCEPT FOR ONE ACTRESS,"I ENJOYED THE PLAY, EXCERT FOR THE NURSE D'ATRA HICKS WHO KEEP YELLING AND MAKING FUNNY NOISES .AND SHE OVER SUNG THE SONG AT THE END OF THE MOVIE. OTHER THAN THAT THE PLAY WAS GREAT . GET THE DVD AND FAST FORWARD THRU HER PARTS AND YOULL ENJOY THIS PLAY."
2,What's Done in the Dark,In my opinion this is Tyler Perry's worst play. It was worst than the Meet the Browns play.
1,Sucks,My god the garbage Tyler Perry puts out. This was unbearable to watch. Tyler Perry should be imprisoned to prevent him from putting out more filth like this.
1,Terrible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This Dvd was terrible the movie was scratched all up and would not play the whole movie I was very very very disappointed!!!!
1,Stereotypes,"Contrary to those who think that recasting negative stereotypes into something laughable gives you control, lessens the impact or gets rid of the stereotype - it doesn't work. The problems embedded in stereotyping still exist. The road to productive black pride is hard and contentious and is not found in pandering to sit-n-watch entertainment escapism. The producers, directors, actors & writers of film and televised programs that make money off of scripts of this type are no different than the black-faced vaudevillians of the late early 1900s."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!,"This play was very disappointing to me. As a black woman, I am offended at the perception of black women at this point in his plays. I have bought his plays in the past to support him in hopes of better character development of the women. If what was displayed in this play is how he views women and the type of interaction he incurs, that is a sad circle. I have met plenty of women from various scopes of life and have never encountered a woman acting so desperate for a man. The more I watch of his plays, the more I feel he has put black women in the ""stereotypical"" role this society has already placed on us. This play is as predictable as the previous plays. Please no more lines from ""The Color Purple."" A little comedy goes a long way."
3,What's Done in the Dark,Decent play. Not as good as other Tyler Perry plays I have seen. All and all pretty good. I would watch it again. It was worth the money.
4,Good stage play,"I liked this play. I seen it before I bought it and still wanted a copy of my own. The seller was prompt with the shipping as well. For thespians that can appreciated great music, I would recommend this play, especially those that are of high morale."
2,Poor Quality and Ill Humor,"Having enjoyed most of Tyler Perry's films and plays, I was not pleased this play. Though some parts were funny, I regret to say that I do not recommend this film for viewing. However, if you should decide to purchase it be sure to have on hand a set of ear plugs."
3,Few have seen,"I've been waiting to get my hands on this video, and I loved it. However, I'm not sure if ""few have seen it"". It came in a package that looks like it's been passed around a bit. Nevertheless it's a great buy. Thanks."
1,Not funny,This movie was a skunk. It was not funny at all. Just some crazy woman trying to flirt with the doctor.
2,Way to long and drawn out!,"I purchased this movie on DVD with high expectation from Mr. Perry. The only good parts of this play were when Mr. Brown came to the hospital. The nurse with the crazy speaking was totally ridiculous to me, I was so annoyed with that. Unfortunately not everybody can pull off stage plays and the woman that did the young man's mother, didn't do too well as far as I was concerned.Lastly, there was no Madea. What is up with that?I will continue to support Tyler Perry, he just needs to take some time and do it right."
2,If your a Tyler Perry fan than buy it.,"I am a Tyler Perry fan so it was only natural to add this my collection. It's the usual TP stage fare. So if your a fan, then just buy it."
2,Not for me.,Not what I thought this CD would be about...not enough moments with Mr. Brown and it was kind of boring.
3,I LOVE all Tyler Perry movies and plays but.....,I have to be honest this play was long there were some funny parts here and there. I feel asleep and when I woke up I saw Mr. Brown and Cora had came into the picture and thats when it was really funny. Mr. Brown and Cora made the movie. I really believe Tyler Perry movies and plays are better when he is in them just like for instance when House of Payne first started it wasn't really that good (it has improved) but when Madea was on there like one or two epsidoes it was really good. I love Tyler Perry and will always support his movies and plays so if you feel the same way you should buy this DVD.
4,What's Done in the Dark,"It begins slow, but becomes hilarious when Brown enters. One character who plays a nurse is over dramatic and acts too silly when the new doctor arrives. She has dated the doctor before in college and have three children, but she acts like a teenager. Brown brings a lot of laughter to the show."
3,and not because Madea was missing.....,"I love (and laugh with) Tyler Perry's work. I thought this production was a bit uneven, although the principles ""taught"" are very worthwhile. And of course, Mr Brown's misspeak is always a hoot. I would give it a B-, and would recommend it to anyone already familiar with TP works. If this had been the first I had seen, well, I would maybe or maybe not have made a point of seeing other DVDs. As it was, I purchased this on the strength of what I had perviously enjoyed."
3,"Good play, but not his best","It was good, but not better than Meet the Browns, Diary of a Mad Black Woman or Madea's Class Reunion. I would recommend it to people because Tyler Perry plays are worth watching."
5,Tyler Perry's What Done In The Dark,Another outstanding work of art from Tyler Perry that is both inspirational and down-to-earth. It was thoroughly enjoyed by my entire family ranges in age from 4 to 48. Highly recommended addition for every household.!
2,Not sure about the distressed look,"Received these shoes for Christmas and like other reviewers, was more than a little surprised at the extent of the ""distressing"" that Sketchers has applied to the shoe. These shoes literally look as thought the UPS truck that delilvered them actually ran them over a few times. There are strange and rather non-stylish black smudges all over the shoe. People have commented that the shoes look like those of someone that has been changing oil and rotating tires all day. The pictures do not show this. Indeed, I think online is the only mechanism that these shoes will be sold...if you saw them in the store you would probably throw up!"
3,disappointed,"I was disappointed in these shoes. They look whiter in the picture. When I got them the are much more beige - almost tan. What was really weird was, they looked very dirty. The shoes looked like they had been scuffed with black shoe polish or something. I returned them and the replacement pair were exactly the same. Obviously, tha's the way they are supposed to look. I would prefer if they didn't have the scuffed look. Otherwise, they are very comfortable."
4,Skechers Siege BROWN 10.5 M Men,Skechers Men's Seige Lace Looped OxfordExcellent product recominedo 100 % from Caracas - Venezuela.Excelente producto lo recominedo 100% desde Caracas-Venezuela.
4,"Great, after breaking-in","These shoes are quite comfortable now, but they took about two weeks to break in properly. In the beginning, I actually was considering returning them because of how uncomfortable my feet were by the end of the day. I'm glad I kept them, though - they look good, they're comfortable (now), and they're definitely made well.Other reviews have mentioned that these shoes don't look exactly like the picture, which is true - they are a little bit darker and have a fair amount of scuffing and marking done by the manufacturer out of the box, but I purchased these expecting them to be like that. I'm satisfied with them, to be sure, even with the initial rough period."
3,A little tight fit,"The shoes were better than I expected. Going by the reviews for this product, I was expecting a lot of dark spots on the leather, but surprisingly there were none. :-)However, the shoes are a little tight and narrow for me. I hope it improves as they are worn more often."
3,Misleading Color,"I bought the Stone color as a gift and was a bit taken back when I received them and opened the box. The shoes have black streakish marks across them on all the cream areas...almost as if they were broken in and distressed for you. Since the picture of the shoe does not show them to be that way I am unsure if it is just my pair or all of them. I would prefer them not to have the ""marks"" all over them. Oh well :("
1,Ugly and waaayy too wide,"I have to say that the distressed look is fairly ugly. These do NOT look like the pictures on amazon.com. Also, these shoes are so wide on my feet. This is ridiculous honestly. I wish I could return them for a full refund including them paying for my shipping, because if I could, then I would. There is absolutely not support in these shoes. I can't even still my own orthotics in these shoes to fix it because they are so wide. I normally buy wider shoes like new balances because my feet are wider than normal and my feet fall right out of these. There is no way that I could wear these for more than fifteen minutes without them hurting my feet or just pissing me off since my feet keep popping out. Unless you are into what looks like worn shoes that are extra wide, then do not buy these."
1,DISTRESSED LOOK SHOULD BE SHOWN IN PICTURES,"Hey, if these shoes are supposed to have the 'distressed' look, then it needs to be displayed on the picture and told in the description! Like the other two kind ladies who gave their review, I too, received the pair with black streaks and they looked filthy. I didn't expect that so I returned them and although I want to get another replacement, I see that the other woman ordered a pair and got the same streaks again on her second reordered pair so I'm hesitant to proceed with another order. I too will be pursuing a full refund for these shoes."
4,Read!!! Product Features,"Reading product features --""Stone color is distressed for a worn in look and feel""Yes, the picture does not reflect this. Although doing a little research at Sketchers' website, you will find that their picture represents the product a whole lot better.Personally I didn't read the part where it says distressed, but who can pass up a bargain like this. Either distressed or not, these shoes would look like that in a few weeks anyways. They are shoes."
4,Nice looking (but definitely pre-distressed),"I like these shoes and they look & feel great (especially for $20.90). But the other reviewers are definitely right in that they come out of the box with black ""distress"" mark son the sand or cream colored leather. While it's disappointing that the pictures don't clearly show that, the marks are applied way too evenly and carefully to not be intentional. I still think they look good, but if you want a ""clean"" looking shoe, this might not be the one."
1,Deception,"I bought this sneakers because I considered Skechers a big reliable brand. I was so mistaken... I have owned them for 2 and a half months and the sole is already worn out and one of them has even a small hole in it. I am not much of a sportsman y I use them only for work (at the office). I have had similar sneakers from another leading brand for more than five years now. You see, I am not like a ""shoe-destroyer"" or something.Conclusion: first and last time I buy from Skechers"
5,awesome,I LOVE this CD!!! I grew up listening to this music and I was so excited to see all of my favorite songs on this album.
4,A good collection,"I'd already bought and seen ""The Four Feathers"" and ""Lady Audley's Secret."" The first is not bad, the second is excellent. What I really bought this DVD for was the two films I had not yet seen: ""The Cater Street Hangman"" and ""Poldark."" If you take the ""Cater Street Hangman"" as melodrama with a modern socially concious twist, it's a gripping film: Taut, suspenseful, and fairly mystifying till the end (I guessed the killer's identity fairly early on, but many viewers may not). The production values are excellent. ""Poldark"" is another story, a historical with a very thin connnection to reality, complete with many problems such as the young lady who always rides bareback--even the lower classes used saddles. The worst problem, though, is that this ""Poldark"" is so very much part of some series not given elsewhere, that not only are most plot lines entirely unresolved, but it ends right in the middle of a scene!"
2,2 were good - 2 were not!,"I thought that two of these mysteries were entertaining and fairly well done, however two were not. Poor quality of film, and they seemed to be quite old - I did not like ""Four Feathers"" and ""Lady Audley's Secret"". Very poor."
1,There is only one good thing about this album,"And that is, those who purchace it are epistemologicaly self-concisous about their depravity and can seek therapy or conversion at any time."
1,False Advertising!,"When I got the book, it was a completely different book cover than the photo! Not only that but it's not even the book I ordered. The one sent to me was titled 'International Student Edition' and that was NOT what was in the original description on amazon.com! I think it's completely ridiculous that I have to pay for the return postage when it wasn't even my fault that they sent me the wrong book.DON'T order from dv_bookstore!"
3,rating,"When package was received, although seemingly packaged well,, the cover of the book and the first few pages were torn and ripped."
3,a few concerns,I love Cynthia Rylant books. I collect them by the dozens for use in my classroom. I was a little concerned with this book because the character was sneaky in getting his pet on the train. I don't like to give my children the idea that it is okay to be sneaky to get by the rules. I'm not sure that I will put this one on my shelf.
4,A Cool Book!,"I liked this book because it's a good and funny book. The way Mr. Putter keeps on saying, ""Are you sure? Are you sure? Are you very, very, sure? "" is funny. It's it a little easy to read. It reminded me of Poppleton. Most kids would like this book. (age 8)"
4,"Low-key, effective erotica","This series was made in the mid-90s and I remember watching it around the millenium on some local stations that no longer show such stuff.It's mostly set in a ""spa"" where both clients and service providers can live out fantasies. Despite only average lighting, the episodes still look fairly good, with some nice female figures and, I suppose, male ones.The music (by the un-erotic sounding Herman Beeftink) sets an appropriate mood to the action that, being soft-core, depends on touching as much as thrusting, thus enhancing an appeal that would be less so with anything stronger."
4,The Report Card,The story is about a girl who has bad grads and she took a test and she did not do good. Also she got all D's and one C in spelling so she is tring to bring that C to a D.I think people sound read it because it is a really good book andd it is like what happen to other when that got bad grads.
4,The Report Card,"Nora is trying to help her best friend by getting all bad grades on her report card. This was a very interesting book, especially for someone who likes to be surprised with a little humor in between. Recommended for all people who like to read!"
1,Just a Bad Book!!!,"This is a kid's book, so why not listen to a kid's views? Andrew Clements just seems to me like not a very good writer. What he does is he has all the interesting stuff at the very beginning, and then stays on one subject for the rest of the book. And, the views in the book are just plain stupid."
2,Oh Dear! Pretty Disappointing!,"I know I will sound like an echo of the previous reviews, but I must chime in, in complete agreement. While I find the author's position on testing absolutely on target, it disturbs me that Nora ends up deciding that she will continue to hide her abilities in order to have and keep friends.I am *hoping* Mr. Clements wants us to be disturbed in this manner, that he actually is putting this sad finale in place to make teachers, librarians, and especially *parents* consider that this is what our testing community has done to children like Nora.Please, Andrew Clements! Let us know!"
2,Just not impressed,"I read this book alongside my son and wasn't impressed. Its started off very slow and I found myself quite annoyed with Nora early on. She just wasn't believable and I found it hard to connect with her because everything about her was deceitful for mostly superficial reasons. I think she could have served her ""best friend"" alot better by actually helping him as best she could instead of on the sly here and there. Her parents were one dimentional, no insight or plausable parenting qualities. Some of the points of view were worth discussing but the execution was poor. My son (10) thought it was ok. He said it wasn't ""too bad""."
3,The Report Card,"I love Andrew Clements, however, I really struggled with this book. It was very hard for me to get into and once I did, I loved the plot and the flow. I just thought everything went a little fast. There were also times that I felt like I was on a fantasy planet. The adults did not seem true to life for me and I wasn't really comfortable with the motive behind Nora's attempt to sabotage her educational record. I mean, I needed something a little stronger. It was very well written and I liked all of the characters, I just felt very rushed while reading it and I felt that I had to buy into some ideas and actions that were hard for me to buy into in the short amount of time this story took place."
3,Review of the most popular book,I love this book but I have to say it is not my most favorite book.I'd give it 3 and a half stars. Maybe 4 stars.3 and a half stars and maybe even 4. And that is my star rating.
4,The Report Card,"Have you ever met a genius that has kept it a secrect, up till fifth grade, that she is smarter than your average student? In this book the main character, Nora Rowley, does just that. She gets C's and D's just because she wants to make a point on the importance of grades. She thinks that the grades that you get don't classify anyone as ""smart"" or ""dumb"".As soon as Nora's whole school finds out that she is genius, everything changes. Her school tries to put her in ""enriched"" classes, but she doesn't want to be classified as ""smart"". So in the end she does make a difference in her school by a speech, telling everyone that they should be treated equal. And that, is how the story ends."
1,prose,"This book is a collection of short haikus, poems and one page observations. I was very disappointed with its structure: it seems to wander all over the place. This is not a proper guide book for the newcomer."
5,Great heated eyelash curler,"I have tried a lot of heated eyelash curler: from Talika's which is really pricey (and not curling the lash very well), to Sephora's which is just about the same price as Emjoi but its curler case would split and the battery would fall off after using for a while. Emjoi is by far the best heated eyelash curler I've used. It heats up in seconds and the heat is just right to curl the lash. It also comes with a cleaning brush. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a heated eyelash curler."
1,lashes looked no different,I bought this item because it was one of my gold box offers and it had a couple good reviews. I don't think it works at all. My lashes didn't look any different after using it. I would not recommend this item.
1,Unusable,"Never got the hang of it, there is no grip for the curler to go on the lashes. Very UN user friendly. Hot Lashes is much better, it ios the only one that works."
5,SHE'S BACK BETTER THAN EVER,Free To Be is an amazing dance remix CD from former Expose member Gioia Bruno. This new sinlge has amazing remixes. As soon as you hear it you'll love it. Can't wait for future releases from this talented DIVA.
1,problems not addressed by Newair,"I first purchased this dehumidifier in 10/06 and it quit working almost immediately. Newair did replace it and the replacement worked until June, when it suddenly quit functioning. I contacted Newair re the warranty and got no response."
3,A little small,"This unit works its little heart out, but it's just too small to do much good in my RV. If you've got moisture/mold problems, bite the bullet and get something a little bigger."
4,staying dry,"I recently bought a house in the country and converted a shed into a study room. I purchased the Newair ADS-300 Dehumidifier to keep my books and furniture dry. It works like a charm. It is compact, silent as well as effecient. It maintains the room dry and free of the usual wet smell in high humid areas. The low price is another plus as well as the free shipping. Much satisfied."
1,Doesn't work,I was really excited to get this product however it has not worked since I have received it....... I'm still contemplating returning it.
2,Stopped working after 2 months,I have had the same problem as others - this unit worked fine for 2 months and then one day I went to empty out the pan and it hasnt worked since
1,On and Off Switch Broke within a month of purchase!,"Although the unit did a marvelous job in the three weeks I owned it...the on and off switch suddenly froze and then literally broke off. Upon further examination, I discovered that some plastic attachment in the switch area had kind of melted inside it...(This could have been the cause of the malfunction but I am not an expert!) I would not recommend it for the sole reason that an investment in a devise such as this ought to last longer than one month. I am deeply disgusted and disappointed."
2,Not strong enough,"I'd read previous reviews of the ADS-300 dehumifier. They accurately conveyed that the dehumifier is quiet, small and uses (I assume) little electricity. I purchased two and placed them in my bathrooms. However, I haven't been impressed with the quantity of moisture they removed from the air. Although I haven't measured it, it appears to be in the neighborhood of 4 oz/day."
5,Nice Dehumidifier,Small and somewhat quiet. This is a string hum but nothing that can't easily be ignored. I've had it running for a couple of weeks straight with no probably and it fills up every 2 to 3 days.
1,It doesn't work!,"I bought this product because I take very long showers, and then once I open the door to my room and let in all the steam, it is hard to sleep because it is so humid. I left this in my bathroom for weeks, making sure to even leave my door closed. Well, by the end, there was not one drop of water in the bucket. Obviously very disappointing."
3,"Great,but","A great recording, but I don't know this artist and have nothing to compare it with. I will try to get other performances by this artist to uase as comparison"
2,I just don't see the attraction,"I've heard so much talk about Marie Howe--the next wave, some have said. I read this book and I don't get it at all. A couple intersting poems, but in the end the book did little for me."
2,very uneven collection,"I do not think I would give this book two stars were it not for a few poems that were quite good (there is one about bullies and another about a hideout in the woods). The rest is, as other reviewers have said, very over the top and self-indulgent. I met the poet once in a workshop and found her demanor to be very similar to her poetry. Asking always to be impressed with a courage to face things that are made important only by insistence. Very diasapponting."
1,THIS EMPRESS HAS NO CLOTHES,"Let us not be fooled any longer, you and I, for this poet's vision has always been myopic. Ms. Howe embodies what is wrong with American poetry today being self-centered, reliant on bathos and self pity to elicit the ""poor me"" syndrome of much maudlin literary expression. They once refered to Lope de Vega as ""el monstruo de la naturaleza,"" Ms. Howe's poetry seems to have been written by a Monster without the beneficence of the aesthetics of nature. Not recommended!"
5,Left me speechless!,"I was actually alerted to this book after a composer who had actually set one of the poems as a song. I knew I had to read it right away after he told us about it. So when I returned home, I bought it. I couldn't put it down. I've since read it several times and everytime it makes me see the little things we take for granted in our lives. The connection she makes with the reader is absolutely amazing. Buddy is one the best poems I've ever read."
1,Defective line of phones was discontinued,"Nice idea--4-line system, intercom, caller id, cordless, speaker phones, etc. But in practice, these phones simply broke down. Brother no longer sells these.We spent ~$900 on a system of these with both speaker phones and cordless variety. Cordless failed after an exchange, and cust service blamed our airwaves (radio station or something, perhaps). They swapped our cordless units for more speaker phones. But one-by-one, the speaker phones failed, with symptoms being cracking, popping sound on speaker and handset, or simply not being able to hear anything at all. We now have only 4 functioning speaker phones, and I fear they will die too. Problem is, I'd have to buy a whole new system to fully cover our house.Be careful when buying a multi-line phone system for your small office or house--make sure it has been proved reliable, or you could get burned."
5,exceptional value for the small office,"We have a four person work environment and three starter kits (four line desk sets, wireless, w/caller ID); for the money, I don't think there is a better deal. We came from a 30 station major phone system and the only thing missing (when you add the phone company's VM) is the music on hold. If the quality from the customers side did not look professional, if we were not all pleased and proficeint at our own desks.......... the system would be worthless. It works well and we are masters of its potential. Good Deal."
5,One of the best psychobilly albums ever!,"This is Mad Sin's first album, and it's not have any ""heavy"" songs on it like their more recent stuff. There are no ska songs on this album like the other reviewer indicated. Cramps fans will enjoy the cover of ""Human Fly"" which wasn't on the original vinyl release of this album. My Favorite song on this album is ""Vampire Slut"". Soundwise this album sounds similar to the Nekromantix."
4,Not their first album,"I hate to make a stink, but amphigory is actually their 3rd album I believe, I always get it confused with Break the Rules as far as the sequence. It is great, not real heavy, but I do prefer Thrills and Chills or their newer stuff, Survival of the Sickest is great..."
2,My tedious little book...,"Not a fun read. I enjoy a Victorian voice in literature, but the author's attempts at humor and cuteness within this voice made it necessary to reread passages. It got to the point I almost did not finish the book. I gave this author a second chance after Louis Drax, but will not read her again."
3,"Great premise, disappointing ending","The beginning of this story held so much promise. A prostitute from the 1800's and her mom (?) find a time machine in the basement of the home where they are supposedly working as housekeepers and go to 21st century London. There they find the supposedly dead husband of their employer and other people from their time, who time traveled rather than commit suicide. However, once in London and the 21st century, the novel dissolves into a love story and becomes like many other romance novels. Sigh. However the writing was very good and there were enough interesting and funny little items in the book to make me finish it even though I knew where the plot was going."
2,My Dirty Little Book of Stolen Time,"Usually love Liz Jensen's writing, but didn't particularly enjoy this book. I didn't like the ""accent"" of the main character throughout the book, and the story line waas too wandering. Sorry Liz. LOVE all your others. Cecilia"
4,A Fun Book To Lose Some Time In,"A somewhat formulaic time travel adventure is elevated by it's plucky and hilarious narrator: An 18th century Dutch prostitute who ends up in twenty first century London. I found by the end logic went pretty much out the window, and the suspension of disbelief was stretched thin, but still, it's a fun quick read, and the voice of Jensens heroine makes for an entertaining time trip."
2,Updated review - 4 stars.,"This product went on easily and looked great. My first application resulted in a tremendous amount of spin-off, for which I originally gave this a 2 star rating. However, I realized that I did not follow the directions of waiting to drive a full 15 minutes after applying. I reapplied it this weekend, let it sit overnight and it made a world of difference. There is still a small amount of spin-off, but I attribute this to the Goodyear Fortera tires on my Jeep. These tires have grooves on the sidewall, which holds more gel than you really need for the tire.I recommend this product, but give it time to dry before you drive."
1,Writing - A Forgotten Art,"This is a compliliation of some of the worst writing I have even seen, which seems to be leading nowhere. If there is a theme, which has yet to emerge three-quarters into the book, it is buried in sentences such as: ""In one part of Northern Europe, however, little was only briefly large.""Only if that sentence means something to you would I recommend buying it."
3,It's been done before by the same author,"The author has an earlier book which I have entitled ""Napoleon and his Artists"" covering most of the same ground.I did not buy this book for the above reason and a quick browse confirmed that suspicion.Thus this book rehashes almost the same topics - Napoleon's life, his achievements especially in the artistic sphere and thru Josephine's patronage, his relations with the savants, during and after the Egyptian campaign, specific anecdotes on Vivant Denon, Jean L Gros,and of course Jacques L David. Nothing new."
4,Monie was icon of oldschool female rhyming,One of the dopeist female emcees.....monie is a classic female artist every hip hop lover should have in there collection
3,Monie Love-Down to Earth,"I purchased it for the songs:It's a shame/Monie in the Middle,which were the jams back in the day.And guess what,they still jam!"
4,Utilitarian File Folders,Folders are pretty nice. Some what reinforced. Black in colors but not rich black. A bit washed out. Almost more of a dark charcoal gray. Has the slots to put in a label tab on either side. This was important to me. I have some folders already that only provide those slots on one side. I will most likely buy again.
2,"A complete dud, which isn't a surprise","Maybe I just didn't receive the surgical implant, but I don't understand why Gunter Wand is celebrated, much less why he deserves a multi-volume ""Wand Edition"" on the Profil label. The definition of a stolid Kapellmeister who leads every piece in the same lockstep of cautious conventionality, Wand does the same here. I've never heard a duller Brahms Serenade #1 -- Wand drains it entirely of sparkle and youthful energy. The Weber clarinet concerto is a winning piece, and it comes off resonably well, although the soloist is no great shakes. I admire Mr. Morison's reviews, but his admiration for Wand leaves me baffled."
5,River of Tomorrow (Wabash River),"I enjoyed this book so much, as I am a resident of the areas where the story took place. The book was a page turner, could hardly put it down. I would recommend this book."
5,River of Tomorrow,This book was great and I got it at a great price on Amazon. This book is part of a trilogy: Dream River and Lonesome River. You need to read all three.
4,A real Plus,"If you use the Clover mini iron, this is a very good accessory. It holds the iron while not in use and is much more stable and safe than just setting the iron on the board. It's pretty clever."
4,Clover Mini Iron Holder,The product arrived and it was as described. The delivery service was very fast. The iron holder works very well.
4,"Just some hex bits, but a good price.","There is nothing special here. These are some hex bits. The price was good. Nothing to say beyond that! If you want a simple set of hex bits, these are as good as any. We are happy with them."
4,Quality 80's melodic metal- with Jeff Fenholt on vocals!,"This was a great melodic hard rock/metal album from 80's band Joshua- whose leader/guitarist, Joshua Perahia, was an outstanding shredder- as fast as anyone in metal- and also a good, solid songwriter. This is also the only album where youcan hear former Jesus Christ Superstar broadway lead throat Jeff Fenholt singing heavy rock music- and he has an absolutely amazing voice- a huge range and incredible power. This was a classy production- the songs are anthemic, uplifting and catchy, the musicianship, vocals and production are all top notch. It is getting scarce these days so pick it up while you can- it would appeal to fans of classic 80's hard rock and AOR bands like Whitesnake, Journey, Kansas and Van Halen."
4,Decent early Heinlein.,"This collection of early Heinlein works is worth reading, though the somewhat formulaic stories contrast sharply with Heinlein's later works. It is a great example of early pulp short stories, but the works are largely technology driven and the collection really shows its age.On the upside, this collection's most character driven story is ""Requiem"", which chronicles the aging title character's desperate quest to finally fulfill his lifelong dream. This tale seems to foreshadow the style that would eventually land Heinlein amongst the ranks of the great masters of the genre.If you are at all interested in the history of science fiction, or how the genre got to where it is today, read this collection. It is definitely worth it."
1,Boring,"The first two short stories seem to have nothing to do with the main story. I couldn't stand Harriman. If an enginneer says it is impossible or the plan needs to be changed, he should agree with them and change it. The story itself is boring because you never learn much about the main characters."
5,"Good, enjoyable Heinlein fare","Part of the future history group of books, this is a solid set of stories. I like these books as much because they have an optimistic vision of the future as because they are great stories. A fun, enjoyable read for any Heinlein fans or for people who want to read science fiction from a time when people had high hopes for mankind's potential."
3,"A good read, but Heinlein has done better","I consider myself a Heinlein fan, and normally like his books, but this one just wasn't quite as gripping as some of his others. I'm not specifically referring to action, just the ability of his stories to hold on to you. It's still a good read, and I generally agree with the other reviewers when I say that Requiem is my favorite, and the one about the transportation engineers is also very good. There is a good amount of political and social commentary in this book(which, with Heinlein, can vary significantly from book to book), but I've just seen it presented better in some of his other works. Don't get me wrong, I still think this is a good book, just don't let it be your only introduction to Heinlein."
5,Had to buy this just for memory sake.,The reason I bought this album was not to open it but to have it once again in my possession. I grew up listing to all the artists on here.
1,A history of witchcraft,I am now in the process of returning this book...as to whether I receive a refund is of no consequence..it is totally useless to me if I cannot read it. The type set is so very small. A magnifying glass is needed. I wear glasses..they are up to date.
3,Fun but not as good as the original,"More Mancini and more ""Gunn."" If you're a Mancini fan or just like 50s big-band/jazz, you'll enjoy it, but all in all, the music's better on the first ""Gunn"" set. Excellent sound on my European pressing of the CD."
5,More Music from Peter Gunn,The music on this CD is totally relaxing. Henry Mancini was a great jazzartist.
2,Not up to the original.,"This CD does not live up to the original...Music from Peter Gunn...CD. It actually contains four of the same tracks as the original, and the tracks that are different are uninspiring."
4,Its a Mancini but not that Mancini!,"A second series disc on the same material is always a dangerous project for an artist. The strong reference of the first original Peter Gunn album made expectations on this too high. This is a Mancini but not as brilliant a Mancini as the first Gunn. I have both and oh, I have also the soundtrack for Peter Gunn, the film. But I am a big fan of The Man. If its to be your first Mancini, I suggest you prefer the original which is also here @ Amazon. Ave Mancini."
4,Sonn of Gunn,"This CD contains all tracks from the original ""More Music from Peter Gunn"" Soundtrack LP. It includes 5 additional redundant or unrelated Mancini tracks. The music here is every bit as good as in the first Peter Gunn volume. The two Peter Gunn albums plus the Mr. Lucky album make a trilogy of cool TV detective music from late 50's television."
3,Intriguing,"The negative reviews of this album are likely too focused on the race and background of Berry. Truth be known, if he didn't include his picture on the cover, you wouldn't know he's a white kid from Kansas. He blends styles of artists like John Brown's Body, Lucky Dube, and Bob Marley with adept skill and an exuberance that shapes an authentic reggae sound. Sure, it's not GREAT, but it's an engaging debut that WILL satisfy true reggae fans."
2,Hard to say...,Got this for my grandson - thought the story line was weird and my grandson soon lost interest about 7 minutes into the movie. Maybe if I had watched the entire show I would rate it differently???
5,Love at first sight,"My son fell in love with the little toaster, and the movie was no disappointment either. Wonderful movie for any child despite age of the film."
2,Mediocre Kids Movie,"I recently watched this with my 3 year old son and was mostly disappointed. The film doesn't display any real heart or creativity to make it stand out and I doubt this one will garner any repeat viewings. It felt like a second rate Saturday morning cartoon rather than a movie in terms of the animation and overall production quality. The story is an odd mix of wacky pratfall antics, serious subject matter like animal cruelty, and left-field songs about things like the internet (seriously, no kidding). This film just pales in comparison to releases from Pixar or most of Disney's other major movie projects, and isn't even on par with other more creative TV programs for kids like Charlie & Lola or Little Einsteins. Not recommended."
5,satisfied customer,we are thrilled with the value an quickness we recieved our order an will be a repeat buyer
1,Disney's animal rights message?,"I was enjoying this movie until I noticed that part of the plot involves villains stealing animals to be sold to an animal research lab (that Toaster and his friends rescue). This not only perpetuates the myth that scientists walk the streets trying to steal your pet for experimentation, but conveys the message that animal experimentation is wrong. If you are are an animal rights supporter, then this movie is for you and your kid. Instead, if you support the responsible and humane use of animals in medical research avoid this movie at all cost.I can't believe Disney's writers didn't notice the underlying message in this movie. I can only conclude this represents their opinion on the subject. Very sad."
2,Kept Making Me Look at the Clock,"Just how does one combine the great Samuel L. Jackson, a crack team of commando police officers, and a villain willing to pay $100 million for freedom and make something as clunky as ""SWAT""? Well, if you want the answer to that question, this laborious ""action"" thriller is for you. As with most contemporary films, check your brain at the door; in fact, the only thing you'll really need it for is ticking off all of the other movies you'd rather be watching. Of course, you could also spend the time cataloging the many films this one seems to raid for ideas . . . ""Heat,"" ""Bad Boys,"" ""Licence to Kill,"" ""The Right Stuff,"" ""Executive Decision,""--not to the mention the 70s TV series upon which it is based. The story--an international gangster gets nabbed and the SWATsters battle former team members to keep him--is just a flimsy excuse for some ho-hum action sequences and lots of tiresome macho posturing. Even the usually ultra-cool Jackson seems bored with the goings-on."
2,N.O.T.,"The first hour is a complete tedious snooze. You know you're in trouble when there's a shot of LL Cool J shopping in a grocery store. Training, training, TOP GUN-type posturing, training.Michele Rodriguez starts off with the same scowl she's had in every movie I've seen her in, then smiles a couple times in scenes that make me think there might be a love interest--then nothing. Whatever humanity was hinted at (and there wasn't much, believe me) is quickly jettisoned for the by-the-numbers action scenes.I give it two stars for the action scenes in the last hour, but that's being generous. No surprises to be found."
2,pretty typical action movie,"not bad, but nothing really stood out... typical action movie formula...-hero does right but is in trouble.(the rebel)-bad guy introduced (foreign accent)-hero, good guys build team (training ""in action"" sequences)-twist in plot / backstabbing-big fight scene-hero winsnot bad really but predictable with a few ok jokes. rent it."
2,Less plot than Black Hawk Down,"It seems as though if I enjoyed any movie to come out in the past few years, I better be a fan of Colin Farrell. Has anyone else noticed that he can't say no to a movie, even if it is a mindless action movie with little to offer in terms of plot. SWAT is just an excuse to blow things up and shoot everybody.This movie is more predictable than 80's horror movies, but despite these major problems, Samuel L. Jackson and Colin Farrell manage to do a good job as members of SWAT. I only hope Samuel L. Jackson begins to realize that the mindless action movies he is in are awful. At least Vin Diesel didn't grace this movie with his presence."
2,Saw it for the first time on TV last night....Bad Film!,"I skipped this one in theater because it looked cheesy and man is it ever. Colin Farrel and Sam Jackson's talents are wasted in this mess of an action movie and the dialogue and realism of SWAT is below-average at very best. Don't even rent this stinker, catch it on cable for free."
3,Overrated,"The fact that this story is hardly plausible undermines it, and you have to take it for what it is.... An action film with a thin excuse of a story."
2,"no impression, whatsoever","Poor Colin Farrell ... I thought this actor was a little more picky with his role choices, being quite the controversial celebrity. The poor actors in this film tried to work with the dialogue given, but this movie left no mark, emotional nor intellectual on me. Someone mentions S.W.A.T. and I think ""I haven't seen that. Oh yeah, I have, but I don't even remember what happened in it"", because I totally zoned out. This is not good. There was quite a bit of character development, but this went nowhere, because in the end nothing was really concluded properly. (Probably a sequel is on its way). I have never seen the 70s television show, but would definitely not watch it after seeing this movie. Talk about boring. Action gets boring when there's no proper character and romantic development to go along with it. This movie was disappointing, to say the least, and Colin Farrell was immemorable as a sexy S.W.A.T. member."
2,S.W.A.T.,"When I picked up S.W.A.T. at my local blockbuster this morning I obviously wasn't expecting a perfect film - I more or less just wanted an easy way to be entertained for 2 hours. I unfortunetly wasn't even really entertained.S.W.A.T. is plagued with problems from the start. The film is chock full of plot holes and gaps, it's filled with characters you know extremely little about and to be honest, the action is that intense. There's nothing here we haven't sen a million times before, and there's really no unbelievable directing flare to speak of either.There are some talented actors in this one, but it feels like they're just riding the wave through it. Also, there's plenty of corny cop lines in the dialogue and some cheesy music to boot.Overall, there's really little to like in this one. A couple good one liners and a decent explosion or two, but that's about it.Film: D+"
2,Every American stereotype in bold relief.,"You have seen this movie before. No really. You have. Maybe in different movies, but you have seen it. Every cheesy stereotype that typically is part of the Hollywood film experience is here and you will groan in recognition. The rebellious protagonist, the tough single mom, the insufferable, paper pushing boss, the team of people that no one believes in who prove themselves in the end, the evil foreigner and oh, the weak link in the group who betrays them. The only stereotype missing is the Jewish best friend. Even the dialogues are full of what the script writer thought were smart one liners. The action scenes are slick and the movie moves along at a fair clip, but you've seen it all before, and better rendered so why bother watching this?"
2,S.W.A.T,"Aint nothing great about this movie. I think it moved along real slow. Not even that much action. This movie kinda sucked. If you want to save some time, just stay away from this movie. It isnt nothing great. It isnt worth the rent either. Wasnt really an entertaining movie, thats all I have to say about it."
5,SWAT,"I never saw this movie in theaters, but after watching it on TV i had to buy it, it has a lot of fun scenes and is generally good."
3,good action flick not spetacular,"This a better film than what most people will lead you to believe although not spectacular it is very entertaining in its own right. Has some subpar acting and a weak dialouge, but if you like action and colin farell then you should see it."
5,Great Action Movie to have,"This is a great action movie that you want to have. Great picture, great story, Great discount price ($10) and very good movie you want to add into your blu-ray collection."
3,Low-stress summer fun,"If you're the kind of person who hates movies where the plot is relatively obvious, the quips are somewhat jaded and the acting takes second place to special effects and action sequences, I have some advice for you - DON'T GO SEE THIS MOVIE.This movie is aimed at the mass-market, easy entertainment crowd where the eye candy is more important than the plot. I liked it for what it was - 2 hours or so of no-brainer fun."
4,Not just a shooter,"I went into this film expecting another cop shooter, which is fine. However, I was left with a sense of greatness. I am not saying this is a top 5 film in the action enre, but it certainly is a must see for action film fans. A lot of fun and worth watching over again."
4,S.W.A.T. (BLU RAY),THIS REVIEW IS FOR BLU RAY. JUST RECEIVED THIS BLU RAY DISC 2 DAYS AGO AND WATCHED IT ON MY PS3. MAN! IT BLOWS ME AWAY WITH PCM AUDIO AND CLEAR PICTURE QUALITY. LOADS OF CLEAR GUN SHOOTING AND EXPLOSION SOUND. 1 STAROFF FOR SIMPLE STORY.
3,Slickly produced mainstream action fluff,"Based on the 70's cop drama TV show, S.W.A.T. is pure slickly produced mainstream action fluff of the highest degree. Beginning with a rebellious and disgraced SWAT member (Colin Farrell) who is picked to join a new squad (which includes Michelle Rodriguez, LL Cool J, Brian Van Holt, and Josh Charles) by a fresh out of retirement sergeant (Samuel L. Jackson). Soon afterward, the head of a European drug cartel (Unfaithful's Oliver Martinez) is captured and offers 100 million dollars to whoever breaks him out of prison, and the crew ends up having their hands full when anyone and everyone comes out of the woodwork to claim the bounty. The film looks great and his some great action scenes, and the cast is nicely assembled, but it's an ultimately shallow experience. If you're a mainstream action fan, this is worth a look, but there's better, more character driven action films out there that are more than worth your time."
2,COULD HAVE BEEN A WHOLE LOT BETTER!,"Mr. Jackson is a true Great actor. However, he needs to be more selective in his roles. unless it is about the money.I mean I am a big fan of his. But what impact did he have in this movie. Plus,The plot was weak. And the Villan was really boring. And You love to hate. I don't mean that in a Good way. No you actually hate his role and wish they could replace the actor along with his boring dialouge.Movie should have been a TV movie."
4,Another fine Samuel L. Jackson flick,"Great fast paced action movie with incredible sound. I am not a movie expert, but I don't believe there was, if any, computer genrated images. This is important because I like somewhat real action (even if the plot is unlikely in the real world).The characters have a great raport with each other, and there were many laughs in this movie. I didn't LL Cool J could act!Don't wait until it comes out on DVD; see this movie today!"
1,People call this action!!!,"I didnt waste my money going to see this at the show.Knowing it would be the tripe it really is thank god i hada free rental are i be kicking my self in the arse. This isso lame I won't even bother talking about it insted i willname some ""REAL ACTION"" flicks with an actual story and notjust a bigger budget sequeal to speed. Try Hard Boiled,The KillerA better tomarrow 1 & 2 John Woo works of art before doingAmerican movies. Heat, Ronin, All of Tarantino's works and Leon you know movies that are closer to reality then anything else and don't have to have music in every scene to make up for crappy dialogue so if you want real action check em out but if your another teeny stick to your mindless dribble."
3,ALEXS CAPSULE MOVIE REVIEWS,"Highlights: Confident debut direction; well-adapted to the show; witty screenplay; griping action.Lowpoints: Absence of one single novel thing.Conclusion: Unless you were a huge fan of the show, or simply adore Colin Farrell, chances are you'll find SWAT just another action movie. It does not falter or go wrong at any time, but also does not exceed expectations the least bit - enjoy the slam-bam action and laugh at the never-ending flow of humor (how else to keep an audience intrigued but placing handfuls of Sam Jackson/LL Cool J/Collin Farrell puns inbetween relentless action?) - you'd be better off watching 'Heat' or the original '48 Hours' though."
1,D.U.M.B.,"I will put this in 8 words: I WOULDN'T WISH THIS ON MY WORST ENEMY. My brother just brought it home a few weeks ago and I wanted to see it. Boy was I dissapointed. It's basically a group of barely trained wild young men(and a woman) who end up on S.W.A.T After accepting the offer from The Leader(Samuel L. Jackson.) Colin Farell is the take in charge talented favorite, L.L Cool J is the black guy with muscles and Miguel Rodriguez is the beautiful one the hero falls in love with. They are assigned to escort a prisoner( Who has just offered 100,000,000 to any one who breaks him free.) To a jail. In short words, All Hell breaks loose. Bad acting, O.k plot but slow, Terrible."
2,WEAK.....,"""S.W.A.T"" had an actual storyline and character development?....you could have fooled me. The movie was full of unnecessary choppy scenes and lacked any sort of flow....I have seen and enjoyed many action movies, but this was just a lousy waste of time. SO...why not one star??....Two Words...Colin Farrell....*Yum*"
4,One hundred millions bucks for anyone who rescues me!,"Swat (special weapons and tactics) was for 2003 probably the hottest and most exciting film of that year. Samuel Jackson is in very good shape as well as Colin O' Farrell who leader the main tactic command in L.A.After several explosive sequences, the great end is about to come when a dangerous and requested thief once captured is sent to Federal Prison and twice he evades the legal fence.The astonishing sequences, underground chases and the climax sequence run for you, but over the years they have become a referential cult movie, and like the good wine has overcome the acidic test of time.Funny, exciting and entertained from start to finish. Kudos for Olivier Martinez as the French capo (Do you remember him in Unfaithful?)."
5,S.W.A.T.,"This movie is realistic and heartening, the escape plan is exciting. This movie gives excatly what it promises; it's a shoot em' up, high action thriller. Samuel Jackson and Colin Farrell were great as was the rest of the cast."
2,Random movie that goes nowhere,"Finally saw this. I like action movies, but this one didn't have enough going for it to make it worth watching again, let alone earning. Some good actors here, but ultimately, the random pacing and poor plot build up just killed it. And for action, these are unforgivable misses. The pacing was slowed down by attempts at character building that had nothing at all to do with the plot, and when the betrayal happened I couldn't help but feel that it came out of nowhere. The escape of the bad guy was too well orchestrated with no basis at all. Where did those resources come from? The people? What brought them together? Money? I certainly watched it to the end, but now that I've seen this, I couldn't recommend anything about it."
5,S.W.A.T.,I love this movie and all of the action that it has. I would recommend this to anyone to buy and watch.
3,3.5 STARS to be exact,"Good action film, quite entertaining...yet wouldn't say its my favourite. Have no specific complaints...I'm just not as ""involved"" into movies like some are. I'm sorry, I won't get offended if a movie doesn't have a perfect dialogue and such. Regarding the movie itself, go for it!"
3,Action ...,"Fast paced, and entertaining; this was a good movie; although some parts were predictable."
3,Saturday Afternoon Fare,"SWAT, like many action flicks, has little in the way of plot. What it does have is hokey, already done, and (worst of all) predictable. Theoretically, that's okay, because we don't really watch action films for the great and meaningful story, now do we?Of course not! We wanna see stuff blow up! Unfortunately, SWAT just doesn't deliver in the blow-it-up or burn-it-down department. Rather, the movie begins with a momentary bit of interesting character development, that the director leaves behind and never picks back up (a real shame, since it was the best part of the movie), continues of with an hour of nothingness, and then fizzles to a conclusion, having failed to deliver any thrill.While SWAT is not the worst movie in the world, it certainly doesn't rank in the ""just for fun action flick"" genre. Rather, I would place it neatly in the ""Saturday afternoon, rainy weather, nothing to do"" category."
2,Painful,"This movie had promise, at least I thought from the preview, but I was pretty much disappointed. It lacked originality beyond what the preview offered, a guy offering some millions of dollars to anyone that could get him out of prison.I will give it a bit of praise in the action/adventure part, it certainly wasn't boring, and in fact, I've actually watched it twice, however, because of all the problems I just can't bring myself to call it average, so I'll stay with the two star review."
3,O.K. Movie,"this was a good movie, but if you really want to see it- rent it, don't buy it. it was just one of those movies that was just...there. it didn't go anywhere, it just sort of ended and was done.it's worth watching once, but to buy it??...probably not."
1,SWAT,"A waste of Colin Farell & Samuel Jackson's talent.A lame action film with PG13 violence, PG13 gangstas and PG13 language. Unconvincing nonsense that marginally passes the time, with your diet coke and sweet popcorn!"
2,"A long, long movie",At first SWAT starts out with a promise of an exciting action film. However the first two thirds of the movie ended up to be all dialog. It was long and boring and I couldn't wait for it to end. It's a DVD rental.
4,"Not An Oscar, But Still Fun","While not an Oscar-worthy film, this one is just plain fun to watch. The action is good and for once the stunts are believable and not absurdly over-the-top. The dialogue was solid with wit and humor to it. There are some good lines and funny situation-based dialogue. The acting is solid. Nothing seemed to be forced and the actors worked well together and complimented each other's performances.The plot was solid, but there were a few ""I knew that was going to happen"" moments. Almost like a quarterback telegraphing his pass. They don't, in any way, detract from the fun of the movie. This movie is worth seeing, not necessarily a must see, but definitely worth the cost of a video rental."
4,Better Than Expected,"An arrested drug kingpin is transported by a Los Angeles Police Department SWAT team led by Jackson's character out of the city and into federal custody. Plans go awry when the kingpin offers $100 million to anyone who can free him.This was a fun and excellent take on the '70s TV series where a wily SWAT sergeant returns to assemble, train, and lead a group of five officers who have to escort a notorious international criminal. Director Clark Johnson who has worked as a director (""NYPD Blue"")or actor (""Homicide"") on a TV police drama doesn't go over the top and lets the movie remain faithful to original source. The cast here is great with Jackson as ""Hondo"" and Farrell as Street and Olivier Martinez brings a weasel-like charm to his character. Even Steve Forrest, who portrayed Hondo on the TV series has a small role here which is nice to see."
3,An ok action movie....,"I was kind of disappointed with SWAT but not to disappointed. I mean the movie didn't really get started until the end. Some movies can pull this off with leaving the audience wanting more, but unfortunately SWAT wasn't one of them. Jackson did a really good job in the movie and so did all the actors but where there's no plot there's no movie."
2,"Ok, but not the greatest of action films","The movie starts kind of slow and then once over half way through the film you finally get to what it was supposed to be about, protecting a criminal who will offer lots of money to anyone who can save him. If I can recall correctly, the first half of the movie has nothing to do with this. Disappointed with it since was hoping for more I guess with the movie getting a lot of attention on either Cinemax or HBO where it's played often. Then the ending I thought was kind of strange as well. Nonetheless, it could satisfy the average action buff.Peter J. Miller"
5,WHAT,An imprisoned drug kingpin offers a huge cash reward to anyone that can break him out of police custody and only the LAPD's Special Weapons and Tactics team can prevent it
4,wonderful!,"this movie was excellent. i didn't give it 5 stars because the plot could have, but just barely, been better. the action was wonderful and the ideas ingenious!"
3,meh,there was one really cool action scene that involved none of the stars. some gansters attacked a police convoy with a lot of heavy weapons. The main characters were not interesting and the action wasn't that great.
3,The movie about nothing,"Okay, this movie was alright. What it lacked in plot,orinality,and what-not, it made up for in action. The whole time, I was looking for some plot,I didn't find anything.This movie was seemed to have been written by some mediocre middle school student for a ""Creative"" writting assigment. The best thing about this whole movie was these model looking actors to keep both the women(F.Y.I. Collin Farrel) and the men( F.Y.I. Michelle Rodregez) almost paying attention to the movie. You can tell by the way that Collin has his shirt off alot in the movie and the fact that Michelle is this strong female role model who can take care of herself, which by the way makes her even more appealing to guys. Although, full of action sequences, car chasing and all of the nessesary elements to make an 'edge of your seat thriller' falls flat on its face."
1,BAD BAD BAD - does not do justice to the original TV series,It was with great anticipation that I went to see this movie. But what a disappointment!!! The original SWAT TV series was 100 times better than this movie. This movie is just a thrown together action film without any plot to appeal to low intelligence audience. AVOID at all costs.
2,The Let-Down of the Year...,"By the looks of the tv spots and trailers I thought this movie was going to be better than Training Day, but I was wrong. This is a pathetic excuse for a movie. It has decent action, horrible acting, virtually no plot, and the ending is a disaster.This movie is about a SWAT Team member (Colin Farell) who gets kicked off of his SWAT team only to be put back on another SWAT Team led by Samuel L. Jackson. As luck would have it as soon as the team is assembled a terrorist escapes from prison and they drag on for about an hour before they kill him in the end.Special Features include Audio Commentary, Deleted Scenes, Theatrical Trailer, Gag Reel and Five Featurettes."
2,A waste of a great ensemble of actors,"Although I was warned by a friend that this movie wasn't that great, I went ahead and rented it anyway.The big attraction to this movie for me was the top actors. I love Samuel L. Jackson, and Colin Farrell, and figured with these two involved the movie couldn't be that bad.Well I was wrong (yawn) after enduring predictable dialogue and action scenes that seemed unexciting and very repetitive to say the least, I wish that I had saved the money and spent it elsewhere. No real story line, boring scenes, and nothing that even slightly got my interest, I would say that this was a fine set of actors used in a very disappointing way.Don't waste your time or money on this one."
3,The action saves the film,"As a Police officer I generally give Hollywood a handicap when it comes to Cop movies and how they protray us. I will say on the bad side. The plot here is far from 100%, and it was not in line with the tactics, nor the action of the film. It does not do for S.W.A.T. Officers across the country what Backdraft did for Firemen. However, on the up side it has some great action. The weapons, and devices are state of the art. It is great to watch the team in action, and the wit of dialogue between characters is very good. It will keep you entertained if you ignore the plot. Also, S.W.A.T. or E.S.U. (Emergency Services Units) are all about team concepts. The individual Officer who saves the day at the end of this movie was not the way to finish it. The team should have won together. See you at the movies TC"
4,Good Action Flick,"Really entertaining! Farrel does a good job of portraying a cop with a brain and a conscience, and perhaps a shade too much loyalty to partnerships. Jackson is always a pleasure to watch with his on screen intensity, and truly likeable personality and attitude. The movie starts out fast and furious but slows down to get you acquainted with each of the players. It picks up nicely and moves on briskly through to the end. I think this is better on the big screen, but probably will view well on your TV."
1,"Horrible, horrible, horrible","This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The dialogue is comedic, the story is comedic, and the scence when men dressed as ""cholos"" and street thugs attack a police escort with RPG's and automatic weapons is rediculous. How it ended up getting the thumbs up by the director and/or producers of this movie is beyond my comprehension. Comedy is funnny usually becuase it is obsurd, unfortunately the obsurdity in this movie wasn't planned, or, perhaps the joke was intended to be on us (the viewers). I regret knowing that the time in my life spent watching this terrible movie will never be retrieved."
3,Eh...predictable,"I've seen alot of movies, beleive me. This movie is worth watching, but it's very immature and predictable. First off everyone communicates with each other like they're all in high school. Everyone wants to fight. Secondly, there are several things about the movie that are predictable. (Betrayals, bulky hobo concealing guns (duh!)) This is action packed and suspensful towards the end, but don't expect anything intelligent."
3,wwweeeelllllllll its ok,looks ok sounds okits an ok movieits a movie you watch 1 or two times a year
3,Not the TV show (good) Not Great and Not Bad,"It's an enjoyable movie. Watch it, enjoy it, then toss it out of your head once you're done. Fans of the TV show will see little resemblance but that's best. Jackson is very good, the whole cast is. Regular movie goers will be able to figure out most of the plot before it happens but that's ok also, this isn't deep literature."
3,SWAT IS DEFINELTY NOT WORTH GETTING.,Cant say that I completely disliked the movie but it simply is not good enough to be in my collection.Some of the action scenes are okay but they are too sporadic and the story was very weak.The acting by the cast was decent but I did not care too much for some of the actors.This is just another mindless action movie which may appeal to people who liked bad boys 2.TRUST ME AND SAVE YOUR MONEY BY NOT BUYING THIS AVERAGE MOVIE!!!
4,S.W.A.T,"Well, ok, so it wan't much for character development or emotion, but to tell you the truth if I wanted character development and emotion, I would have rented The Invisibles (again). When you pick up S.W.A.T., you're looking for action, a few laughs, and the hot guys in body armor. (And girl as well in this case). And S.W.A.T. delivers. The training sequences are spot-on if you like that kind of thing (which I do) and the good old fashioned mayhem is top-notch. There are a few good jokes that kept me laughing. I mean, come on, ""Lakers purple""? That's good. And the teeny tiny hint of military humor was great fun for the Navy girl in me. (Even though Colin Farrell is waaaay to young to have retired from the SEALs.) You kind of have to be in the mood for action, humor that's clever in the way that's kind of not, and a non-existent love interest, but if you are, S.W.A.T is perfect."
1,SWAT - Sorry Waste of Actors' Time,"There was no story here - it seems like they went through and took bits and pieces of the 70's show to come up with this film. It was a waste of some pretty good actors' time - it was just plain dumb. The writer(s) and filmmakers figured they had a prefab hit so no creativity went into its making. It's your basic - outsider is brought in to build a team of rebels who, in the end, beat the bad guys and impress the authority figure they were rebelling against. Even the borrowed use of cutting to video screens (as a ""hip"" technique) was old and tired."
5,Voices of Sarafina (VHS),I saw this video in 1988 on TV and recorded it on on my Beta. Don't laugh...I knew I would want to watch it again and share it with my children and now I can share it with my grandchildren. It has a message that is expressed in a delightfully entertaining way. I am having it transferred onto DVD. The Music is wonderful and fun. The seller (Eric) from PA was great in processing and shipping my order and then following up with an email to ask about my satisfaction. I am very happy!!!!
5,kids love it,"My girls are 2 and 4 years old and of course are avid lovers of mcdonalds. This toy has provided them hours of fun. It is nice because it doesn't have tiny parts instead it comes with table, cashier counter, oven, drive thru menu, ronald, customers and workers. its really very cute and I think most kids would love it mine sure do.."
4,I CAN'T IMAGINE...,"I can't figure out why my 4 year old daugher wanted or loves playing with this toy! She loves it! I think it's boring. But, then again it's not for me! HA!She plays with it all the time, and drives her care bear cloud car and little people vehicles thru the drive thru. Is it just ours or do the arms not move on all the little girl figures?I'm still glad she likes her Doctor kits better. HA!"
4,saucy s. watts,"you are not very nice mr or mrs Watts. shame on you for calling your review ""a perfect way to make fat kids fatter"". who says fat kids will get fatter? this toy doesnt promote fatness. the reviewer who said ""we use our manners to order the food and you certaily don't see a lot of that nowadays!"" is so right. you are rude, Watts. dont come on amazon until you can learn to respect people and behave. you need a slap on the wrist."
5,beatiful ep,this ep is bangin better than the ... they try to pass off as black music. She is a true artist. i MEAn her voice is as smooth as water. the beats vary from drum and base to jazz. i just cannot wait till her debut is released i bet it will be an instant classic just like this ep
5,Best of her Best,"Bonnie helped me make it through my seemingly lonely years at college. From this album on, I became a lifelong fan of hers. ""Love Has No Pride..."" Geeze, it just doesn't get any more achingly beautiful than this. The other songs on the album really round out her diversity. If you like Bonnie now, you would have loved her back then. Try this one out, you won't be disappointed."
3,"Super cute, but very small. Make sure and read measurements prior to ordering.","great seller, this is really cute! But make sure that you are in complete understanding of the size prior to arrival so that you will not be dissappointed! Great for self contained water gardens, etc."
5,Oh what a night!,"I grew up on this album. Whatever happened to Diamond Shell? This album was pretty good. This is his one and only; no follow up, so enjoy."
1,Cheap scissors that leave baby's nails ragged.,"These are terrible. The blades are the cheapest things imaginable -- so blunt that they leave nails ragged, making it even more likely that your baby will accidentally scrape himself with his nails. And the rounded edges make it nearly impossible to use them on the tiniest nails. And they are larger than regular adult nail scissors, which I now use on my baby instead of these.Don't be fooled as I was by the fact that they're marketed as baby nail scissors. Nothing about these scissors suggests they were actually designed to be the safest thing to use on a baby's delicate, small nails. The only thing about them that says ""baby"" is the (admittedly cute) butterfly design. If all you care about is how they look in your medicine cabinet, these will do fine. If you actually want to use the scissors, definitely get something else."
1,SUCK don't buy,"I don't know if it's bc i'm left-handed but most scissors work just fine, not these. I can't cut anything with them. They are dull metal parts that should be sharp don't even touch."
5,Great Way to Cut Baby's Nails,"For some reason this nail cutter is listed under toys. So when it came to rating, of course I am going to say this toy is not much fun and does not have educational value. Must be an Amazon error.Other than that, I love to cut my baby's fingernails and toenails with this. It is simple and makes cutting nails painless. The price is also something I love. I don't know why parents use the metal nail clippers when baby scissors are so much safer and easier to handle.My only complaint is that the finger hole is a bit small for men's fingers, if daddy wanted to cut baby's nails."
4,good scissors,Pros:good gripblunt tipCon:extremely sharp bladesEither/Or:sized for a medium to small adult handPersonally I prefer baby scissors to not have such sharp blades.
1,Scissors,"The scissors are not a toy, and I was asked to review them as a toy. Hence, my rating may be of no value. I was a bit disappointed as they don't work very well to trim an infants nails."
2,I returned mine today.,"I don't know if it's common with this model or if I just got a bad one. In either case, I returned mine today. On several different movies, the picture and sound would just start to break up. I had it for a week or two. At first, I thought it was the movie - but it continued to happen too many times. I also have an older Panasonic A210 which doesn't have this problem (on the same movies). I'll most likely buy a different one from Amazon.com. They've always offered great service and were very helpful in providing me information to return this item. They even sent the UPS label out to me, pre-paid for the return."
5,One of the Best DVD Players,"The Panasonic DVD-RV30 is a solid machine, with many useful features. The picture quality is amazing (especially on my big screen using the S-Video connection), and the sound is great. Just bought X-Men last night, and have tried several other DVDs, and they all work perfectly (even X-Men's seamless branching feature). The on-screen menus are logical and easy to use. As others have stated, I guess it couldn't hurt to have a lighted remote, but I've already got a feel for this one after only a few days. It's not a big deal at all. I would definitely recommend this player, especially considering the rebate through Panasonic (I have not sent it off yet, so I can't say anything about it). Happy viewing."
2,Problems Playing Some DVDs,This DVD player ocassionally freezes in the middle of playing some movies. The only way I have been able to get it to continue to play the movie is to skip to the next chapter. 2 movies that I can think of that this player has problems with are Gladiator and The Princess Bride. Both these movies play flawlessley on my other DVD player which is 2 years older and by another manufacturer.
3,Disappointed,"I received this dvd player for Christmas. It worked really well and then about 9 months after having it, it began to freeze on certain chapters in movies, but it happened on the ones I rented, so I thought there was something wrong with those, not my player. Then I got the Moby Play dvd and when I put it in, it would say ""No Disc"" and wouldn't play. After about 30 times of ejecting and putting it back in, it finally played. Then I figured, maybe it's the dvd. But then just after Christmas the next year it wouldn't do anyhting. It just said some code on the player itself. I called the company and they said that they couldn't tell me what was wrong with it, just that I had to drive about 30 miles to take it to a repair center to have it shipped to Minnesota for them to fix it, and since it was after the warranty I would have to pay. I was very disappointed. I don't think I will buy Panasonic again."
4,Great for my beardie,"This worked really awesomely for my bearded dragon. It made him more lively and really brought out his colors, and he seemed overall just a happier dragon after putting this bulb into his tank. The only problem I had with it was that it burned out after less than a month of use, so I had to contact Amazon for a replacement. I wouldn't use any other bulb."
5,Great product,"One of the best UVB bulbs on the market. The one petshop I found that had these wanted $50 for it so buying it off here saved me a great deal of money. I was worried about shipping a bulb as they are fragile but it made it in one piece due to great packaging on there end. I purchased a standard housing for it at Walmart (about $10), took the plastic cover off (less obstructing of UVB) and mounted it inside my 40 breeder tank. Definitely will purchase again as they are to be replaced once a year."
5,ARRIVED IN ONE PIECE,"This is the new 'skinny' style energy efficient bulb and it did not work in my old style fixture. My old fixture used a fatter around light tube. This new tube plugged into the old sockets, but did not light up. Once getting a new fixture, it lit up just fine. I don't know how necessary UV-B is for my iguanas, but the lizards are doing well so I use it. I was concerned about breakage shipping this bulb, but it arrived undamaged."
2,Started Out Well,"The light bulb was great! At least for the first day. The day after we put it in our turtle tank, it burned out. Very disappointing."
4,I Hate Bugs.,"In short, a woman is raped by a human cicada. She gives birth to a son and 16 or so years later her son turns into a giant grasshopper and rapes another woman. It's a fun movie. It moves quickly and has some romantic drama, until the son becomes an insect. Its a little over dramatic, and the acting needed some fine tuning, but the writing wasn't bad and the concept was interesting. It was hoaky and campy in places, aren't all these movies at some point? Check it out. You'll like it."
5,Way Cool !,I just odered the movie and have not seen it in many years. But let me tell you. It is such a fun movie. The rape scene when it begins is so trashy. And I love trash in movies. I am a big John Waters fan. But getting back to the movie. There is a scene where a dude is making hambugers. Totally creeped me out. Every time I hear cicadas during the summer I think of this movie. The book was good also. Happy Horrors !
2,Not worth the time.,"Nothing new here just rehashed and done so poorly. The movie gets 2 stars only because House of the dead holds the title for worst zombie flick. The birds in this movie apparently don't do anything but fly around you annoyingly, and you can fall 4 stories and walk away as long as you land on someone else.Don't waste your time."
1,The Beast Within,This is the word for word description from the back of the Blockbuster case:In the Southern swamps a woman is raped by a demented subhuman creature. 17 years later her son goes beserk and begins a transformation into a cicada-like monster that takes revenge on the townspeople involved in a grim secret.I've been sitting here for like twenty minutes and I can't think of anything to say that would be funnier.
1,Total Turd...deal with it.,"OK, let's all be honest here...for a change. What this movie has is a mythic beast having sex with defenseless women (knocked unconscious by banging their heads into trees), lying alone in the wildnerness.Anyone who watches it and enjoys it, is a freak. Anyone that purchases it online (or on any other ""line"") is likewise a freak.If this is what you want from entertainment then rent two hookers and an ape costume.S. Daily Warren"
4,"silly, but a great movie for it's time!","This was worth renting. The original box says: We dare you to sit through the last 30 minutes of this film without covering your eyes, screaming, or running from your seat! A good movie for its day. I added this one to my collection."
2,I Love A Cheesy 80s Horror Movie But...,"This movie is just really dull. You just can't take the movie seriously, and this movie tries hard to be some kind of serious revenge story. By the time it gets to the monster scene, you ended up not caring and just want the movie to be over. I have to say, this movie does have one of the funniest monster transformations I have ever seen! At one point, I thought he was about to turn into ET!"
2,"If you're a female, don't buy this for running","My wife bought this to use while trail running and for races since she hates having to mess with the crowds, etc. at water stations. She 5'6"" and 130 lbs and on every run over 10 miles, the Alterra has literally rubbed the skin on her hips off leaving her a bloody mess after her run. The reason I say that it won't work for a female (unless you are a female with no hips or butt) is that it continually rides up and bounces around, no matter what adjustments you make. It is perfect for biking and hiking, but don't even think about using it if you plan on running comfortably!"
2,Not for running...,"I bought this pack so I could run for longer periods of time without getting dehydrated, but the first time I tried my Alterra I was really disappointed. One of the zipper cords broke the first time I opened one of the pockets, and then when I went for my run I had to continually tighten the waist strap. The Alterra also bounced around a lot and was uncomfortable, and it kept hiking up my shirt. So while the Alterra does a poor job for running, it does work fine for bike riding and hiking- although I probably opt for one of the Camelbak backpacks, then."
2,Disappointing,"I bought two of these last year when I started trail racing. From the beginning the seal leaked. I was also never able to completely get it filled with water, which was slightly annoying. It is very hard to clean, as the reservoir does now come off of the pack. The worst part is the seal leak, though. As I run, I can feel drops of water on my legs, which is extremely annoying and distracting. I would not suggest this pack. I recently bought a Catalyst and am much MUCH happier."
1,Leaking after first run,"Started leaking from the fill cap (closed as tight as possible) on my second run. Leaking as in most of the pack that holds the bladder, as well as my lower back, was soaked in less than 10 minutes of running. Afterwards I emptied it, let the entire pack dry out, (the next day) filled it again, and hung it over the shower rod in my bathroom. After a few minutes the area around the cap was soaked. After a few more the entire bag was soaked and dripping water into the tub. I see that at least one other person reports a similar problem with this model. Sent it back to amazon for a refund. Very disappointing as this would have been an excellent hydration pack. Would be great for running, given the various storage pockets, clips, compression straps and the volume of water that it can carry comfortably- WHEN IT'S NOT LEAKING! But it leaks...and so it looses. ;-)"
4,Possibly the best deal on Amazon,"If you like Guitar and you like Ragtime, then you will really like this CD. The Artist very closely copies the piano arrangments of these standards and plays them at a tempo that is not hurried, so you hear all the notes. You will probably end up as I did, playing it over and over again. It is really a fine piece of work. The only negative I have is the artist did not use the greatest guitar in the recordings. I've heard much better sounding instruments. Also, the quality lacked a little, but what do you expect from a budget CD."
3,It's pleasant enough.....,"This cd is pleasant enough, especially for the price. However, for those of you who want a bit more spirited renditions of ragtime guitar music I would recommend players such as Duck Baker and Mary Flower. The classical background and precision of the performer on this CD creates a technically pleasing rendition of the tunes but they really need more of a ""Blues Attitude"" to be more than 3 stars to my ears."
4,lovin' louvin,"Songs of the Louvin Brothers is a nice cd at a great price. While I am not an expert by any stretch, for my money this cd is a good collection of songs beautifully played by some pretty impressive musicians. Radio shows with the likes of the Louvin Brothers I am a long time fan of, this cd will open the doors for more of this wonderfull music to find its way into my music collection."
3,"An easy read, but superficial","This is a short, easy-to-read book -- which is good because it has very little to say and, if it were longer or harder, it wouldn't be worth the effort. I've never read Proust, but I have to imagine that his philosophy life wasn't as thin and banal as it sounds in Botton's description of it."
3,Interesting Hybrid,"I came to read this via de Botton's fictional work (Kiss and Tell, On Love, The Romantic Movement), which I loved. Proust was a name I certainly knew, but the notion of sitting down and reading his seven volume Remembrance of Things Past was (and is) rather distasteful. Here, de Botton has applied his imagination and deft, witty prose to using the Frenchman's mammoth novel as a sort of self-help guide cum literary biography. It's a strange mix, and the pleasure comes in seeing how de Botton pulls it off, rather than the actual ""lessons"" drawn from Proust, which are rather obvious pieces of common sense (at least to me). It's worth a quick glance--if for no other reason than to see a very unusual hybrid of a book--and it's very short in any event."
5,Formative and Entertaining,"De Botton has a way of making great artists and philosophers what they are - human. He doesn't mock or over play faults to make void the entire, but shows that due to this fault they may be great but human, if not great observers on the nature of what it is to be human. This is also the type of book that if in parts you feel like it doesn't speak to you then you might consider yourself fortunate. Some of it was a bit hard to swallow, like Virginia Wolfe's suicide being attributed to Proust the way it was. Ruskin's influence on Proust as intensive as it was is believable, however. Ruskin had a profound influence on many from Gandhi to Oscar Wilde and Ruskin's style strikes an intimate immediacy to it that might motivate anyone to action.I like how De Botton respectfully humanizes his subjects the way he does."
4,how ro be like me,"If it weren't for his graceful writing, graceful thinking, graceful gracefulness, this book might, like De Botton tells us Proust was, be too ingratiating. But it isn't. The book is enjoyable to read. Makes you feel a little refined in your head. Makes you feel like being gracious to the whole world, except, possibly, those not so gracious as yourself....Still, I'd recommend it, even relatively highly. There's information, a refined style, and more than a few points one could do worse than to take to heart."
5,Illuminating reading!,"A lifetime can be spent reading Proust's entire masterpiece.A lifetime can be spent reading one of the seven volumes. And one canspend a lifetime reading just one paragraph. His work is endlesslyfascinating, moving, and frustrating. Alain de Botton has flawlesslyextracted the essence of Proust and adapted it as a ""self-help"" book.I can think of no better therapist than Proust, whose uncanny psychologicalinsight unfolded the human condition in bare white light for the worldto see. De Botton has written a definitive critique and laugh-out-loudfunny condensed version of the definitive ""difficult"" novel. A mustread for serious literature lovers."
5,A self-help book which actually respects its reader!,"I have found myself enthralled by de Botton's language, ideas and observations. We all know that the market is flooded with How-To advice books that purportedly teach us how to stay positive, make a ton of friends, etc. However, this book does something totally different and surprising - it takes on a typical premise of a How-To book (in this case, ""How to Change Your Life"") but does it in such an intelligent and incisive manner that one is tempted to create a brand-new Book Category called ""Cliche-Free How-To Books Which Don't Insult One's Intelligence and Actually Manage to Educate and Entertain at the Same Time"". Anyway, I'm beginning to sound like either a book reviewer or the author's close relative, which I am neither. But don't listen to me - just buy it, learn from it and enjoy it"
2,Impenetrable and maddening,De Botton pays homage to Proust by making his prose almost as impenetrable as the prose of the man he writes about. Reading Proust is worthwile; Reading De Botton is a waste of time.
2,Too Precious,"Mildly amusing for awhile, and certainly original, the book becomes tedious for its cuteness, its archness. Proust will not change my life or yours."
1,A book lover,"This book is a very poor attempt by what I have grown to call a ""self appointed intellectual"". The book totally falls flat of any target."
1,This is not a self help book.,"The book covers the life of Marcel Proust, which is pretty uneventful. Alain de Botton tries to draw out wisdom from Prousts writings and life experiences but doesn't elaborate enough. He also throws in a lot of distasteful British humor. If your interested in Marcel Proust, then read through ""In Search of Lost Time""."
1,Nice Try !,"I Like the way you promote your book...write a bad review about ""Tuesday with Morrie"" and leave a link to your book...I guess anything goes on the Net!"
2,Didn&#65533;t do much for me,"Sorry but although I persevered and read this through to the bitter end, it just didn't do anything for me."
4,wisdom and wit,"I was skeptical about this book because of its ""self-help"" flavor from some reviews but it really is not self-help at all. It is really a book about reflections on some life issues through the writings and life of Marcel Proust and I enjoyed reading it. There are alot of lessons, of course-- keeping mental acuity and interest and finding beauty and stories in all of our environment, (I enjoyed still life paintings by Jean Baptiste Chardin that I looked up in the internet). Take time and make effort in describing ideas slowly and in your original way and detail, ""N'allez pas trop vite"", Experience the actual reality, instead of ""notion"" of reality, with the example of impressionists (also had fun looking up all the paintings he loved."" I particularly liked the last chapter, ""how to put books down"" with his perspectives on reading ""Reading is on the threshold of the spiritual life; it can introduce us to it: it does not constitute it."" It was an easy read with delightful wisdom and wit."
2,Deceiving Title,"I bought this book because of its title. I have always wanted to read ""In Search of Lost Time"" , but got discouraged because of its length.I thought this little volume would sort of distill the wisdom of the original work. I was wrong! The book contains bits and pieces about Proust's life and book.I found it somewhat boring and not helpful at all, but perhaps my dissappointment stems from having a different expectation from this book, that is emplied from a deceiving title."
1,McProust,"This ""not a novel"" can be advertised as a self-help book to the same extent that McDonalds can be advertised as a health-food store. You are left wondering in either case if it is just a joke that you did not get. Botton's attempt to compartmentalize Proust into a Happy Meal is certain to offend any thoughtful reader, whether he has ever read a word of Proust or not.Proust's life and his novel are worth learning about, even though it is debatable whether Proust's novel itself is worth reading. Those who have the misfortune of finding themselves trying to understand Botton's impenetrable writing might find a return to Proust easy going. Just to show us he is a regular guy, he even includes a picture of his girlfriend in his book. Issues, indeed!When others purport to explain art to you so that you can understand it, beware. If you want self-help, go read Proust himself or a diet book, or better yet, Walker Percy."
5,Superb read,"This is a brilliant book. Written with great humour and understated but piercing intelligence, its a really enjoyable work that riffs off Proust with dazzling style. Enjoy this early work from one of Europe's rising literary stars."
1,a collection of smarmy platitudes,"It's hard to imagine how Proust can change your life if you don't actually read Proust. Never mind; the author really wants to tell you how Alain de Botton can change your life. If you remember that in the natural course of things change is usually for the worse and that the road to hell is paved with good intentions, you'll probably manage to avoid this collection of smarmy platitudes. Why didn't I? The title intrigued me. (This book deserves one star for its title, however disingenuous.)But how did I come to hear of the title? An acquaintance recommended this author to me. The acquaintance and I are both fans of another author: Milan Kundera. So instead of ""Not Proust"" I recommend to you in turn the works of Milan Kundera, particularly his, yes, a novel, ""The Joke""."
3,Slim but nicely written,"I have to appreciate Alain de Botton's graceful prose and neat (if somewhat arbitrary) categorizations of human problems. The title is more or less a joke--this is not liable to institute sweeping changes in your life, but may change your perspective on certain matters, which is more or less changing your life, I suppose. It made a very good before-bed book."
5,"Wonderful, smart, a lover of books AND life","Not that De Botton needs my 5 stars, he seems to be a power force of his own. But I just closed this book and loved it from start to finish. It was witty, intelligent, joyous and very very much made me ready to go read the MAN. He achieved something miraculous for a frightened self-taught reader, he welcomed me into the world of Proust. For that I doff my cap."
3,Pleasant book with a misleading title,"The title is misleading. Neither Proust nor the author have much to say about running one's life. ""Random observations on the life of Proust"" would be a more accurate title and under that banner it's a charming, short read"
1,Weak and almost insipid,"I realize I am in the minority but I thought this book was a very weak extraction of some of Proust's concepts that almost seemed insipid after de Botton removed them from their context. I was not impressed with the flimsy essense that de Botton derives from Proust's work. The concept that original observation requires self editing and avoiding stereotypical labeling and categorization is not new news. The concept that reading allows us to reflect on our own circumstances and experiences is also not new news. The third theme that the best artists observe the world in a unique way, allowing others to appreciate their vision and possibly develop a vision of their own was the last straw for me. There are some adolescents with limited life experiences that may find this book of interest. For a more experienced reader, go to the source itself, not this weak distillation."
3,Hmmm...,"Someone writes, ""I have read Proust, thank you very much. And I've read this book as well."" I, on the other hand, have read neither. I give ""How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel"" three stars, meaning ""neither good nor bad"" because I don't know--yet I have something to say, something I think important. Regarding: ""I haven't bothered to proof-read this message for grammatical or spelling errors, so feel free to criticize these at will, if it helps distract you from the actual content of the message."" Criticizing grammatical errors in an amateur review (mine, for example) is very different from criticizing them in a published book. If the reviewer below who finds them in this book has quoted it accurately, that is reason enough to avoid this book or to review it unfavorably. Unless we start at some point to worry about language, the means of expressing ""actual content"", it will soon become impossible to do so intelligibly."
2,"Can you say, self-love?","Rambling comments about Proust. The author lacks content and the ability to bring together the larger picture of Proust's work. I do not recommend this book, but to those who *love* Proust and their own ego, as the author does."
2,lovin life seat covers,"Alhough the product is ok, I am very dissapointed in the color, it is supposed to be purple, but it is actually PINK, if I had known that I would not have ordered since I do not like Pink. But it is not worth the hassle to return. The matching mats are great though. They are actually PURPLE. Don't expect matching items with this one."
3,Bob's Opin,Good variety & some great tunes. Liked most of the songs. Disappointedin about 4 of the tunes / not what I expected of a greatest hit album But I do like it for travel CD
5,If you have hardwood floors get this book,My wife and I bought an Arts and Crafts era bungalow with hardwood floors. Neither of us grew up with hardwood floors and were at something of a loss as to what to do with them. This slender volume concisely but fully explains how to care for these floors. It includes methods for assessing the floor and determing what measures are needed for its preservation.
3,"Useful, but spotty depth of detail",Good overview of cellular operations. Seemed like a bit too much cut-and-paste about communications theory. I was looking for for more depth about cell phone operations. This book did not provide what I was looking for.
5,In Love,"I am in love with this little camera: easy to use, great quality (at least for my needs), excellent price. I could not have asked for more."
2,"Cheap Camera, Cheap Features, Bad Value","Let me just say the only reason the Olympus D-360l digital camera gets even two stars out of me is for picture quality at this price range. I will say that for the six months I had it some of the picutures I have are O.K. for what the camera is. Ok enough mild mannered praise, let the bashing begin!This cameras LCD display never did work right from day one, it would do what it wanted, working some days and some days not. The lack of USB interface is so outdated and slow its just a shame. Never could take more than ten picutres with it before the batteries would die. The LCD display, when it did work was nearly imposible for the novice user to understand. This Camera is just a plain old waste of your hard earned money, but a Kodak DC 280 zoom instead, its only a few more bills, and its soooo much more camera. Avoid the D-360L like the plauge though."
1,"Probably as good as people say it is, if it works.","I can't give many stars to a product that has been returned to the manufacturer. I haven't received a replacement yet. If the replacement works as well as what other reviewers say, I will happily return here and upgrade my review. Until then, a single star will suffice."
4,USES LOTSA BATTERIES!!,"I love the camera and the software, but it uses batteries up WAY to quickly. If you buy this, be sure to get some rechargeable batteries, too."
4,Excellent quality photos,"I have had my camera for about 1 year now and truly love it, I never use my 35mm film camera anymore. the pictures you get with this camera are great and it is so easy to upload them to your computer using the USB cable. This camera is very user friendly and very easy to use. I had never used a digital camera before this one!!!!!!!!"
2,halfway to 5 stars because it halfway works,"I bought this for a friend, and so far it's had to go back twice, both for recurring problems (the rear display screen goes dead) and new problems (blue line that appears embedded in photos). It's a great little camera when it's working. the shots are good and clear, it's easy to use, and the price is right. But I'm shopping for myself now and wouldn't buy this camera again."
2,Not worthy of the trash heap!,"This camera has a very log shutter lag (meaning it takes several seconds from the time you press the button until when the actual picture is taken). Within 6 months of purchase, it suddenly stopped working. After getting it repaired from this still mysterious malady, it never took as good of pictures. My second D-360L exhibited the same weird shutdown withing 2 months of purchase. I would never recommend this as a purchase!!"
5,Great camera,"I am very please with the camera. I looked at the new top-of-the-line ""prosumer"" models (Canon G1, Nikon 990, etc.) and came to the conclusion that they had a lot of features I would never use. I am into point and shoot.I bought a 32 meg memory card (the 8 meg card that comes to with almost any digital camera is way too small) on which I can shoot 73 photos at the SHQ (1 megapixel) setting. I get a good 8 x 10 print at this setting.Another thing I bought is a Sandisk external USB Smartcard reader (about $50). Downloading photos from the camera using the serial port is very slow, and eats up batteris. The card reader is easy to use and transfers a whole card full of pictures in a minute or less.The only thing I miss with this camera is a zoom lense. The more expensive cameras come with 2x or 3x optical zoom."
3,"Great Camera, but eats up batteries","This is a great camera if you are just starting off... but I must say, beware of using the LCD screen too much, it will eat up your batteries. I personally like to view the my pics right away and use the LCD screen to take pics so the short battery life was getting on my nerves. But all in all, it is a good camera."
2,Complain,This camera is very good but in the last few days a yellow lineapeared in almost every picture. You can see this in. . . my web pagephotos. I am writting now a complain letter to the Olympus company asking for a new camera or a total refund.
4,Great for the price.,"Whether you're new to digital or a pro, this camera is so easy to use. The software is easy as well as downloading them to your pc. I've taken some of the best pictures with this camera. The nice thing is that if a picture doesn't come out, you can erase and take it over. I will say that if you use the screen to take pictures, it will use the batteries much faster. So have many handy. Thanks...."
4,"Great camera, OK Mac experience","I bought the Olympus D-360L for my wife as a birthday present. Literally right out of the box we were both taking great shots indoors and out. The quality is great for our amateur needs, and some of the shots even look professional to our untrained eyes. We have yet to read the manual for tips, no doubt the pix will be even better then. My only complaint is that Olympus and all resellers that I'm aware of advertise the camera as platform-independent. However, an 'optional' cable adaptor is required for Mac connecting, and even then only to an older (non- G4, G3, or iMac) Mac's serial port. If it doesn't plug and play for both PCs and Macs, it's not platform-independent. ..."
4,Fun Camera,"I like the camera alot, although I had to send it in for repair (CCD went bad - caused a thin blue line to appear in every photo - I noticed another reviewer had that same problem). Fortunately the warranty was still in effect (1 yr). Tech support guys were were courteous and helpful, but customer support was not - something Olympus needs to be aware of (customer service rep was rude, also emails never returned). Colors in photos are very bold and bright."
3,MAC buyers beware!,"I have purchased this camera and find that I cannot use it as it came out of the box. I have 2 macs (Power pc6500 and Imac) and there is no cable to connect to either one. Olympus Tech support tells me it cannot be used with a usb cable, and you need an adapter to connect it to a mac serial port. They will send you one if you use a couplon which is in the box. (think 6 weeks). The alternative is buy the floppy adapter for the film reader. List price $70.00"
5,Excellent Pixels Per Dollar Digital Camera,"I bought the Olympus D-360L because I wanted a digital camera and I didn't want to spend a lot of money. And the Olympus D-360L have very good ""pixels per dollar"" resolution.The picture quality in the Olympus D-360L is much better than I expected it to be. And it is really very easy to use. I was also impressed with the software that comes with the camera. Its amazing how good pictures come out in low light with no flash.The 1.3 Megapixel resolution is excellent not only for the range of 'entry level' digital cameras. It is also enough good for professional use: rather often we use my pictures in layout of the Home Computer Magazine to illustrate product reviews and so on. The colours are great!The *****-star reviews this camera has been receiving are right on the money. The Olympus D-360L is an excellent digital camera."
4,PALM USERS - BE AWARE,"I received the D360-L as a gift and it has performed admirably. I have even received reasonable battery life by using the view finder exclusively. A major problem was downloading via the serial port on my PC. I have the Palm V software on board and the Palm V synchronization software kicks in whenever the PC is turned on. This in turn made it impossible for the computer to find the camera and download pictures. The solution was very simple but was not to be found in any printed matter available from Olympus or Palm. I found the solution in an ""oh by the way"" comment in a product review magazine. Simply select from the Palm synchro menu the option that requires synchronization to be manually activated. Re boot and the download will run flawlessly albeit somewhat long."
5,Best Camera For The Price,"First, all digital cameras with an lcd eat batteries. that being said, this camera is without a doubt, the best bargain in its price range. having used the camera for the past two months heavily, it has performed better than i expected. the image quality is flawless, even in low light situations. the 8mb card that comes with the package is ample, giving 36 pictures at better than 35mm quality (in my opinion). ease of use? you bet, the camera, once the batteries are installed, is very simple to operate, just open the lens cover and snap away. things to consider when you buy this camera are a USB reader to greatly reduce your uploading time, and either rechargable batteries or an ac adapter. I also purchased another 8mb card to give me a total of 72 very high quality pictures, but being able to review and erase unwanted pictures with the lcd screen, one card might be enough for most people."
1,Shutter Release problem,"When I got the unit, it immediately had a shutter release button problem. I had to press it severeal times before I could take a shot. Sometimes it works and most often than not it doesn't. I was hoping for a better quality from this camera based on its review but got the worst instead. I also noticed that the label says that it's made in Indonesia, I thought it was made from US."
5,Perfect!!!,I knew next to nothing about digital cameras or the software needed for them. I bought this camera and in less than 10 mins. was taking pictures. The quality is very good. I was able to make my way through the software shortly after taking my first pictures and found it very easy to make projects. I'd highly recommend this camera. The price is hard to beat for the quality and it has many features for professional photographers that would make it perfect for them as well!!!
2,Worst $300 digital camera,"beside from its 2-way image output, and its easy-to-use features; this camera has to be my worst investment ever! first of all, this camera takes really really crappy pictures under the dark! my $40 digital web cam can take ever better pictures than this $300 under dark! secondly, it's slow! it takes a whole second for it to store to the smart media. and get this: it takes more than 10 minutes to store its included 8MB smart media! slower than floppy transfer! thirdly, as porbably all d-360l users know and are tired of-this camera consumps battery like crazy!! if you leave the lcd on, you'll use up your 4 AA batteries in no time! in order to get the full advantage of this camera, you must spend at least a few hundred more dollars for a bigger smartmedia card, a USB connector, and packs and packs of super-long lasting AA batteries(rechargeables last about one-half as long) why not reconsider an alternative?"
5,Best Screw-less Plate I've seen,"I've bought some from Lowes and Homedepot, and most are not as seamless as this product. I've replaced my whole house with the Cooper Aspire Screwless Wallplates and love them.While I replaced all my outlets and switches along with the Wallplates, these do not require you to unscrew the existing outlets to put the insert behind them. These also fit much better and are flush to the wall, while other brands were not one solid piece on the sides and gave a ""layered"" look.I've also found these are easier to take off than other brands (yet secure enough I can't pull/pry them off with my hand) if you ever need to paint or replace the outlet."
5,Cooper Wiring 9521DS Wall Plate,"Aspire gangle plates are very nice, clean lines and sophisticated when converting to screwless light controls."
5,This is the best tasting syrup on the market bar none,This is very high-quality syrup with consistent flavor bottle after bottle. I'm pretty sure they've won some taste test with this syrup also.For clarification the difference between grade 8 and grade be is not quality but rather flavor profile. Grade B is the dark chocolate of the Maple world.
3,"Good Movie, Weak Transfer","Massacre at Central High is a very interesting film. Not exactly a slasher. Not exactly a high school flick. It's actually very hard to describe the movie. Since others have already done so, I will simply describe the quality of the dvd. It's obviously a vhs transfer and not a very good one at that (I'm referring to the DVD-R). I don't know if this one will ever get a decent transfer and I really like the movie, so I bought it. If you plan on watching this on a large HD TV, it's gonna look absolutely terrible. It's up to the buyer to decide if the movie is worth putting up with the terrible picture."
2,Back to the Blues,"""Recycler"" is the album in which ZZ Top began to turn their backs on their MTV generated 80s success and return somewhat to their bluesy roots. Unfortunately, it was also about this time that the band began to sound burned out. While ""Give it Up"" sounds like an outtake from the 1983 album ""Eliminator,"" the song ""My Head's in Mississippi"" attemps a hybrid of their old blues sound and their more modern synthesizer material. Little on the rest of the album resonates, however, and by the end you get the feeling that the Little Ol' Band from Texas has passed its prime."
5,zz top recycler,"Full throttle blues at its best.The only way to hear this masterpiece is set your volume to ten,and enjoy!"
2,Worst than the last.,"ZZ Top attempts to turn their back in the MTV that helped make them so hip just 7 years earlier. This album is probably the worst they had done up to this point. It attempts to be half old time blues and half Eliminator, but it just misses the mark both ways.The songs are simply weak and tired. This band sounds like it aged 35 years between 1983-1990. They songs just have no fire... Nothing even catchy with the exception of Doubleback, Give It Up, and My Head's In Mississippi.. Truthfully, none of these three songs would be singles on Eliminator or Tres Hombres.The weakest song on the album is probably Burger Man. Just mediocre and stale like the other 6 songs."
1,not worth buying,"if you like the bluesy sound of early ZZ Top...dont buy this record, its terrible....even the one ok song, my heads in miss. is a peice of crap......i mean come on, you guys cant come up with better songs than this??? if not, than break up and put out some solo albums"
3,Interesting but academic,"I was very interested in the topic, and the book provides the information, but it is not an easy read. There is more information than style. It was sometimes rather tedious to read - but provides lots of specific examples to back up the author's premise. I read some of the chapters out of order, as the later chapters were my main interest, and the chapters were stand alone to a certain extent."
3,Clasic Cheapo Dino Film,"A classic cheapo dinosaur movie with guys in rubber suits that sometimes look pretty cool, but often pretty crappy. The plot is thin, the script is not too swift, and the acting is campy and melodramatic at best. Plus, the color does look more like two-strip Technicolor than an actual modern color process. Yet, despite all this, the movie is good, dopey fun, and a must-see for any connoisseurs of dino movies, rubber suit monsters, or 50s pseudo sci-fi. While not nearly as good as The Land Unknown, this is still a fun flick that I'm glad to have in my collection, and this Image DVD is a very good print of it. Look for the star of The Creature of the Black Lagoon as the former drunkard hero and the cop from The Maltese Falcon as the drunk and out-of-control captain. Enjoy!"
2,A CURIO,"This film features Tyranosaurus Rex on valium. To be sure, it is preferable to having magnified lizards, but still, it is no ""King Kong"" or ""Jurassic Park"" as far as the dinosaurs are concerned."
2,Boring and uneventful....,"I'm usually a sucker for this genre but I found myself agreeing with Maltin for once. The acting and dinosaur effects were good enough for this type of movie. It was the storyline and lack of creativity with the effects that killed it for me. I also feel that this being filmed in color all but destroyed the b/w Saturday matinee atmosphere that makes these movies so fun to watch. Overall, worth a watch, but I'd recommend investing in 1957's 'The Land Unknown' with Jock Mahoney before you spent a dollar on this one. It is in glorious b/w, has a similar storyline with more action/adventure and was handled much, much better."
3,Matinee Fun,"Call me crazy, but I actually like this movie. It's a reminder of a time when a good adventure story was all it took to keep a kids attention glued to the screen. The special effects are far from special, but that's part of the charm of this rather obscure man vs. dinosaur film.I've been an enthusiast of b-movies for years, but wasn't familiar with this one until I caught it on AMC recently. I was intrigued by the well-worn story, the wretched dino costumes, and the truly horrible acting. (just watch the ship captain!) All this and color, too. That must be the cause of the total lack of budget for the remainder of the production, as color was something special in the '40s, and usually reserved for only the high-end films. This isn't art, but if you're in the mood for a bit of mindless retro-adventure, this may be the ticket."
3,the past catches up,"An amateur photographer journeys to a faraway island where natives claim to have seen dinosaurs. Modern man confronts Earth's prehistoric past every day on the Galapagos Islands and in the Amazon forest, so there could very well be dinosaurs.In Indonesia, an expedition to an isolated jungle turned uo new species of frogs, birds, flowers, and large mammals thought to have been hunted to extinction. In January 2004, Indonesian villagers captured a 49-foot python, weighing in at one and one-half tons."
3,Rubber Monsters,"Comment: Well I decided to take a brake from watching my ever growing collection of Blu-rays to watch an ""oldy moldy"". If you feel like you are in the mood for ""rubber suite"" monsters, back projected monster fights, ""Hollywood natives"" and back lot lagoons... this is your movie. Once I discovered this movie was dated 1948, it all fell into place. Although the film is watchable... the negative has definitely seen some wear... as had some of the actors. If you don't have too high expectations of the film, it will somewhat entertain... in a hokey type of way."
4,Unknown Island,"I first saw this movie around 1950, and in my opinion it still holds up well today. The dinosaurs are not up to computer generated standards, but at least they are not lizards. And the movie avoids my least favorite cliche, that of an exploding volcano. The movie does follow the template for a lost world story, with the deliberate buildup, being stranded, character conflicts, attacks by monsters, etc, but it has a good script within these limitations and the characters are well acted. I was also pleasantly surprised by the tape quality, the colors especially not being faded. All in all, a classic movie of its type."
5,Fats Domino Hits,"Purchase was smooth. The CD arrived in new condition, and has so far, not had any problems with listening to it."
3,This book is not for beginners,This book is not for beginners and not presented well (for a beginner).
2,Another Bleak Book,"First, what kind of designer would have an endless amount of time to study every inch of DRAW? Only if you are limited on DRAW only or few other applications. That is not the case with a good designer today, field is full - Illustrator, Painter, Freehand, xRes, ... not to talk about image processing and 3D software that exploded on the market. If you are writing a book you need to be able to make illustrations attractive - how else one can believe that you have something to teach anybody? The book here is another example of poor design that want to earn quick buck. I trully feel sorry that DRAW has such a miserable field presentation in comparison with Photoshop or Painter but I am begining to believe that is the case because the software itself is inferior."
1,My Opinion about this book,"As being an Azerbaijani, I also claim to the picture which is on the cover of the book. Azeri men dont wear this kind of dress which is called ""turban"" or whatever.It shows that how much the author knows about Azerbaijan, its history, people and respectively, their culture and traditions. Standing from this point of view, in addition, i would say that his ideas given in the book more likely dont reflect the reality as the cover picture. It might not be truth (i wish), yet still i highly recommend the picture to be replaced by a picture, in next volumes, that represnts real Azerbaijan, Azerbaijanis and the culture, history and traditions that they possess."
2,Azerbaijan (Cultures of the World),Look at the cover of this book!Turban is a part of Kurdish national dress.Why Kurdish Man on the cover of book about Azerbaijan?Very interesting.
3,Not for the casual supes fan,"The Elseworlds titles place defined & familiar characters in new situations and/or timelines. They are usually strong enough to standalone. Being passingly familiar with the main character typically helps, as you can then more readily follow the reimaginings and nods to events in the main continuity. This title is a good entry in the series, the premise is interesting and points to an innate 'good' in the central character no matter where he might grow up. However, lacking a good understanding of the 'New Gods', Darkseid et al, will impact the average reader simply looking for a 'different' Superman tale. They'll still find it a good read, with some pretty good art, but not exceptional. The ""Red Son"" variant, with Superman growing up in the Soviet Union, might be a more readily grasped book for casual collectors when it becomes available in a trade."
4,A Homesteading Historical Must,A very good Legrand Cannon book that everyone should read to get a perspective on homesteaders in New England pre-Revolutionary War.
3,From the past,My husband loved this book when he was in high school so buying it was an act of remembering as he is now 77yo. The book is in relatively good condition but the cover is nearly destroyed. We are satisfied with it.
1,Sunken Pirate Ship,"This book is a huge disappointment for the price.It only has a few pages, and is not interesting at all.The price charged was almost double the list price on thebook itself. It is only about 4"" x 5"" and not very good."
4,"Fun, Soft Hair Lovin Fun!","I bought a set of these for my kids for Xmas... The laughs wouldnt' stop as they wore these hilarious soft wig hats while opening the remainder of their presents. They are soft, like nerf football foam? and could tear if crammed onto a head that is not the right size. These are ""kids"" wigs... not adults ( though they did fit on my our heads... but tightly). I can already see them trying to incorporate these into their next halloween costume. Note: they also are not ""strechy"" so you really can't tuck hair up into them, etc... they sit on your head like a hat."
1,Waste of money,This article was a total waste of money; there is nothing in it that can't be found online for free. There was no preview or description available and I thought that for ten dollars I would get an actaul article about her life. Instead this document is just a short list of facts that are not even in complete sentences. I am really dissapointed and wish that I could return this.
3,"Dock works great, rechargable batteries don't last","I've been using this dock with my HP 812 for a couple months now. Dock works great for unloading pictures and recharging batteries. Much less hassle than using a cable. Only complaint is the batteries, Energizer NiMH AAs, don't hold much of a charge. Regular alkaline Duracell AAs last longer."
2,Problems with Batteries,"I was very happy with my HP 850 and its charger base until about two weeks ago. The problem started when my camera would not go on, when I turned the on switch the only thing that would happen was the memory card light would flash about five times. After some time trying to get through to teck support I was told by them that batteries were causing the problem. It seems very silly to me since they were the ones supplied with the charge base. but sure enough when I changed the batteries the camera worked fine. this is the only problem I have had with the camera or the charge base in the six months I have had the camera."
1,Camera doesn't fit on the dock,"Camera doesn't fit on the dock as specified (HP 850). Supplier agreed for return, but cost of returning is too hight and already spent money for something that doesn't work, so I scrap it. For other customers, please inquire for fiting before purchasing."
1,Cheaply made item,"I bought 9 of these registers for my home renovation in progress. These registers look cheap, feel cheap, and work cheap. I'll be looking for a better quality register elsewhere. I'm not sure where I'll find them though as this same brand is carried at Home Depot and Lowes."
1,Where's the Candelabra?,"Strictly speaking, this is a recording for people who miss Liberace. It reduces opera classics to Andrew Lloyd Webber-esque Sunday brunch background musak. Dreadful."
5,Aria Sings,"In ""Aria: Opera without Words"" Jean-Yves Thibaudet has chosen arrangements, and sometimes co-arranged operatic melodies in a way that allows the piano to enhance the original rather than being a substitute for the voice. I had thought I would never buy an instrumental arrangement of arias, especially after hearing the sentimental renderings of a certain popular classical violinist, but I heard several tracks of ""Aria"" on KUSC-FM and immediately purchased two copies, one for me and one for a Christmas present."
3,For the initiated,"This book is valuable for somebody who is well grounded in advanced mathematics and has a serious interest in the subject. However, when one's mathematical basics are a bit shaky, it requires a lot of learning. I am quite familiar with computer algorithms, and I have studied quite a bit of mathematics, but this book is quite a challenge for me."
5,The Real Throwing Muses,This is the best Throwing Muses cd. Hersh and Donelly are both in top form. This is the one that made me a fan of the Muses. It's creepy and exciting.
5,They should make hope chests for men!,"Dear World,Energy, swooning guitars, lyrical passion, and great musicmanship between the players. Easily their best and indefinitely their ""Swan Song"" so to speak. With the departure of T, the muses have never been the same formation of sonic strikers. This indicative issue has always been ""bagage"" and yet confirmation for the young Miss Donelly. Anyway, if it wasn't for decision, this interconnected world would cease problems, peace, self gratification and entropy. Yes?Best Wishes and Kishes Mad World. FJE"
4,The sound of 80s Indie,The Throwing Muses never meant much in the U K with just 4 below 40 entries in the Guiness Book faring better on the album chart where this one is listed at No 26Like that other pair of half sisters Voice Of The Beehive who are very similar this is pure Indie guitar pop and very accessible.Typical 4AD liner where you get minimal information and a sleeve photo which ought to be bigger
3,LIKING OLDER OR NEWER BETTER,"This last recording with Tanya Donelly is the least appealing of the Throwing Muses records. Despite the charm of ""Counting Backwards"", ""Red Shoes"", and ""Not Too Soon"", I was disappointed with this record. Later Throwing Muses records (Tanya-less) are incredibly powerful and will be a cornucopia for the senses. Get those instead!"
5,All things considered it is among the best,"Each supporting character is strong and memorable as is the principal character Jack himself. His many phases of individual interaction brings on increasing interest as he struggles all through the West. This film brings out Dustin Hoffman's earliest performance and sets the scene for all those that follow. Pathos, pride, pity, pettiness as well as pretty darn good are his many moods of Jack. You cannot go wrong with Native American philosophy coupled with White American sensuality. M-m-m-m good."
2,Lame,After reading the book- which was excellent- I could not even finish this movie. It tried unsuccessfully to follow the book. The book was so good that even attempting to get it on film was not wise.
1,DVD did not play!,We tried the DVD in several DVD and Blu-Ray players without success. The DVD is corrupt and we would like to return or exchange it.
5,Great Movie!,"There are tons and tons of factual info in this movie and the tongue-in-cheek delivery is superb. I could choke Dustin for some of the poor lines he delivers, but all-in-all it is one great film."
5,A must for DVD-release...,One of the best movies of all times - but why isn't it available on DVD??? Uncomprehensible...
5,Best movie I ever watched,"Really good movie, and as a western, it will never go out of date. Not like the new stuff where they feel they have to throw fists full of blood at your face to get a reaction out of you."
2,ehhh,"I've read the book, so I'm definitly biased, but I'd like to think that even if I hadn't read the book I wouldn't like this movie. It gets two stars for Dustin Hoffman and his Indian wife, who was really hot."
4,"History , comedy , and drama all rolled into one","Little Big Man is a classic , with a story how frontier life was a means of suvival, both physically , and mentally . Rugged , lonely , and sometimes downright suicidal , a young man emerges and lives to tell a story that spans 100 years of the days of Wild Bill Hickcock , and Gen. George Custer and the battle at Little Big Horn . He reflects the lives of Indians and Whites, the similarities of the races , and how protective of their heritage they were .Entertaining from start to finish , with an excellent cast . You can't watch this movie just once .Danny Meacham"
1,Bad deal!,It is not identified that it will not play in U.S. The vendor should indicate that the product is not formatted for playing in the U.S. if it is selling in the U.S. This is the 2nd time this has happened tome and it is not right. My family was looking forward to watching this and now we can't. Very disappointed.
5,still 5 stars after all these years,A beautiful movie that handles the genocide of the American Indian in a truthful tragic manner. The best western movie because it tells the truth.
5,All time favorite!,"This movie has it all, actiom, adventure, comedy and tragedy. It also isn't shown much on TV- a real plus! It also is by and large historically acurate, and a good choice for mature kids 11 and up or so."
5,Little Big Man,A semi-historical classic film I needed to add to my collection. Along with a pespective of western expansion from the points of view of the resident native americans ('Human Beings') as well as the settlers & armies this film showed the continuing and growing acting achievements of Dustin Hoffman.
4,Little Big Man,I've viewed this movie in it's original release. This release has deleted portios I fuess for time sake. This Still is a very well presented movie. I would recomend it for family viewing PG13
5,Great,"LITTLE BIG MAN was what DANCES WITH WOLVES was not; a intellegent, well-crafted account of the 19th-century American West and the state of affairs between the Native Peoples and the White Man...and a great story to boot. Jack Crabb is still Dustin Hoffman's best role and the movie should've up-ended PATTON for the Best Picture Oscar in 1970, but no matter. The picaresque adventures of Crabb and those he encounters along the way still resonates today and still speaks volumes about how this country was conquered and how its original inhabitants were betrayed. A classic."
5,THE OLD WEST LIVES,"An excellent fictional picture of the trials and tribulations of an old man from childhood until he is and old man of 121. How he was raised by Cheyenne Indians, his entry back into the white world and various stages of his life including Custer's Last Stand. Great movie rent it buy it or wait for it to be the movie of the week on TV"
1,Beware The Region Codes!,"I didn't really ""hate"" it. Just couldn't watch it on my DVD player because it had the wrong region code on it. It was made for region 2 which is Europe...needed to be region 1 for North America. Returned it for one with the correct region code."
1,Little Big Man Wrong Region,We never got to view movie it was the wrong region we do not live in Japan. I didn't know there wasa difference where you view the movies I thought the only difference would be language.
1,Little big man,Bought is for my ex mother in law and sat down and watched it with her. I could not wait for it to end and gave up and didn't finish it. She loved it.
3,Little Big Man Movie,"The disk was fine, but the case was crushed when I received it. The movie played fine."
2,Little Big Man,"It seemed more interesting when I was younger. I guess my memory played tricks on me, or my taste in movies have changed!"
1,Thinly Veiled 60's Free Love Video,"This film was simply annoying. The depictions of Native American culture seemed pretty ridiculous, and I find it difficult to assimilate the concept of a white guy being the center of a native community. Perhaps it was ground-breaking at the time of release, but to watch it today one receives an unhealthy dose of stereotypes, sexism, racism and patriarchy. Wish I could un-watch it. Product arrived on-time and in condition advertised."
2,Should be listed in fiction & comedy,"Not what I was expecting. A little too long also. It had funny parts and sad parts, but mostly was a little ""low budget"" and almost put me to sleep. It was in Dustin Hoffman's early years, so I give him a break there."
5,Good viewing,This is a classic as far as I'm concerned. Dustin Hoffman is one of the best actors of our day and this movie doesn't fail to entertain.
4,Excellent Buy!,"Despite the fact that it had a KBToys price tag for $4.99 on it, I am impressed. It was brand new still in shrink wrap. This was one of my fave cartoons/movies when I was younger and now my son is totally into TMNT! He was thrilled to receive this for his 6th birthday and asks to play it every weekend! TY"
1,All parts not included,"I bought this game for my children for Christmas, but it does not have any instructions. I can not find them on line anywhere. Can you help?"
3,Good but not awesome,"This sampler is as good an entry into amplified blues harp as any, but it lacks a certain something in the choice of tracks that ultimately makes it ""not as good as it could have been"". In particular, the choice of ""Three Harp Boogie"" as an opener to put three famous names up there is disappointing since all three of the harp players (Arnold, Cotton and Butterfield) have done way better on their own. Still, if you're curious about the harp sound, there are at least a few excellent tracks on there, the best being Tret her Right's ""Come Back Baby"" with Jim Fitting on Harmonica.Worth your while if yoou want to discover new harmonica players, not if you're out for the best these guys have ever played."
3,Not bad but help could be better,After receiving the PVR-H160 and following al instructions it worked quite well. My beef is that it does not alphbetise transferred videos or pictures. I e-mailed Mustek in Irvine but after almost 7 weeks still no answers to my questions.Wonder if I ever will...............
5,What a great book,"I home school so we buy and read a lot of books every year. So as I was packing up last year's crop of books, my 12yo son picked this title up and said,""Oh that one -What a great book."" That is the best review you will ever get from a kid."
4,Entertaining History,"Making ancient history entertaining? For children?!? You bet.... Enhance your history studies by reading books that are written specifically to a child. Great book complete with historical accuracy & lively illustrations. Approximately 3rd grade reading level, interesting to even older elementary students. Don't rely on it for a primary source, but include it in a study of Greece. Nice book."
4,Don't judge a book by the teacher who assigned it,"Written by my son Zach: I was very disssapointed when my history teacher gave my class this book to read. But when I started reading it, I just couldn't stop beacause I kep trying to figure out what was going to happen in the story. I also learned a lot about Rome by reading this book."
3,Not Bad,"Usually novels set in ancient times are really sort of boring but not this one. The charactors are cool and the plot moves along just like if it were set in modern times. The author said that the idea for this book came about because he had heard of a kid writing graffiti on a temple wall. The sentence was ""Caius is a dumbbell"" only written in Latin. Yes, they had a problem with graffiti in B.C. days too. Detectives In Togas takes that one sentence and builds a pretty good story around what might have happened if whoever wrote the words was someone important in the town. Could it be true? Did someone frame one of the kids to take the blame for something? If you like your mysteries with a little bit of cultural history thrown in this book will make you want to find out more. The historical parts might even make you want to learn about how like was back then as well. So it's like a 2 for 1 thing. Not too shabby for a book you might not otherwise read."
5,Recommend,Two of my children read this and couldn't put it down. They loved it! I would recommend it to those that like historical fiction/who-done-it thrillers!
2,Not so great,"I had to recently had to read this for school(6th grade) . Me and most of my friends would end up talking , eating mints, and yelling at our book by the end of class. Now I am a good student and got in A in that class. But I found the story very split. I either couldnt follow it at all or it was to predictable. Not a good read. I found myself dreading reading it."
4,Good and Bad,This book is full of adventure and mystery. However this book have a lot of grmmer mistakes. I recomend this book to young readers that likes mysteries.
2,If you can stick with a slow book this is the book for you.,This story can be slow at times you just have to stick with it becauseit can be good at times.
2,Detectives in Togas,Dectives in Togas is a very boring book. It has very little action and even when there was action it was not very intense. People who like none violent mysteries would like this book. This book takes place in ancient Rome. Most of the action takes place at night in the soothsayers house.Rufus is convicted of a crime and sent to jail. His friends try to find some evidence that he is innocent. Their main suspect is a soothsayer. Then they find the real culprit and set Rufus free.I would not recommend this book people would be better of reading Eragon or Deltora Quest witch I read and loved but this book was rather dull.
1,Not Worth the Money or Time,"My sixth grade English class read this book and it may be the worst book I've ever read. The story is boring. Except for mabye one or two, the characters seem lifeless. Three in particular seem to fade into the background. The storyline is the same of any other mystery like this: some kid gets accused of something he/she didn't do and his/her friends try to prove his innocence. It's extremely boring! This book is a waste of your time and money."
5,GREAT Creativity and FUN!!!,"My son dragged me into his preschool classroom to show me this toy and the things he could create. I decided to buy a set to have at home. I never dreamed how MUCH fun he would have playing with this toy. He literally will sit down and create things for hours. It is the most played with item of all the toys we own. It really encourages creativity and my son loves following the recommended patterns as well as coming up with his own creations. The pieces are very durable, yet flexible, and will not come apart as small legos sometimes do. The pieces fit together well enough to stay together, but yet aren't so hard to fit that a preschooler would struggle with it. The storage box is very sturdy and the hard top lid keeps pieces from getting lost. Definitely a good purchase!"
5,Well worth the effort!!,"Dominic Streatfield presents us with a beautifully crafted and written piece of work. Even though this book contains nearly 500 pages, I suspect it could have numbered far more. Nevertheless, I appreciated his chronological presentation of the role *coca* played in pre-Columbian South America up to the contemporary use and abuse of *cocaine* by Americans and Brits alike (the author is in fact British!). And even though this book is non-fiction, the author's injection of his personality and experiences while researching the book were refreshing and comical. In short, a great read that can provide hours of conversation fodder!"
4,Great History Lesson,"If people took more time to read, perhaps we could avoid the idiotic things like the War on Drugs, or, the War on Terror."
4,ah...rememba those crazy-azz daze...when miami bass wuz king?,"Had this on cassette back in da day...da explicit version cos datz how we rolled. driving dat blue Pontiac 6000 from da mid eighties, had da two 6x9's, dat Realistic brand after market AM/FM Cassette playa I bought @ Radio Shack and the EQ/Power Booster I bought from a friend. This was before Luke veered way into the novelty act side afterwards with As Nasty As They Wanna Be. Lemme also give props to Luke's collaborators The 2 Live Crew: Mr Mixx, Fresh Kid Ice(there wuz plenty o sightings of dis cat in Miami Gardens. Saw him once at da gas station), and Brutha Marquis. Good songs, well let's see: P..A.. Ni..., Ghetto Bass, Word. This was da real Miami Bass Sound."
3,Good book,I wish this book came with a CD but is a great beginning book with favorite folk songs. Many of todays children don't know the tunes so a CD would be helpful. It breaks down learning the guitar into small steps.
4,Great for the right age,"I bought this for our 4 1/2 year old who is already doing fairly high level puzzles, is very good at rhyming and is reading basic words. This game is just too easy for her but she has enjoyed playing with it anyway. For her, it would have been perfect about 6 months ago."
4,nice concept,"My four age son loves it. He actually will come up with more words that could rhymes.So it help kids learn words, think of more and understand the concept of rhymes. Also it is a puzzle so he is learning how to connect them. All of the puzzles are differnt shapes so you only can fit the correct piece with each other. Still it is hard and makes kids think to get the right shapes match. I like this idea better than just reading rhymes books."
2,not great value,"There is no way this nightstand retails for the $300+ price indicated. I paid about 120 for it and it is not good value for the money. On the positive side...it comes fully assembled, the finish is ok, the drawers work. On the negative side, the piece may contain some wood, but is certainly not solid and the drawer pulls are very cheap looking. I tried to find replacements and could not find modern pulls that lined up with the holes in the drawer."
5,very nice!,"very nice piece.. we bought 2 sidetables for our bedroom because we didn't like the ones that came with our bed and dresser. it is a pretty dark espresso finish (not black, but close). looks modern and drawers go in and out very smoothly. they are also pretty deep drawers that will fit a lot."
3,The screws were all over the box,"Con's - When I received the package, two rails were flopping around inside. I looked through packaging and found the screws which were suppose to hold the rails in place. This was the bad part about receiving the product.Pro's - It's real wood, easy to screw down the screws which fell out during shipping (I would assume they checked their quality before shipping) not sure that's a Pro, good height with respect to my bed, looks pretty good, no scratchesoverall it's an ok deal. I would also like to mention that this problem with the rails only happened to one of the nightstands, the 2nd was ok."
1,Cheaply looking not worth it.,Price was compelling and finishes look better in the picture. Thought the hardware was actual metal... false! Looks cheap and worth under $100!BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!
3,Cappuccino night stand,"I would have given it a higher rating had it not been for the cheap handles on the drawers. They are wood that is painted silver. Thankfully another reviewer had mentioned this, so I wasn't surprised. I chose to buy anyway as it went with the bed and the price was hard to beat. Coaster packs this furniture extremely well and it was only very slightly dinged in a few places, but nothing big. If I had the energy and time, I would go get new hardware for it, but the other reviewer has warned that this process isn't that easy due to the holes in place. Besides the hardware, I have no complaints. Solid wood construction and the drawers slide in and out smoothly."
4,Just beautiful,"This piece came VERY well packaged and in excellent condition. It is gorgeous. Very sturdy. I would give it 5 stars but it does scratch easily so I am using protector disks under the lamp, phone, etc. Very nice piece for the money. I am looking into the matching dresser."
3,Wife Loves It,"My wife is learning the dulcimer. True we had to scramble to find a cassette player, but the music lessons weren't too bad. This text is better suited for someone that has some experience and not a new beginner."
2,Not impressed,I'm a faithful Garmin user and own 7 of there different products and hope they don't make any more like this one. It glitches on me all the time and I can't trust it to get me out of my harbor. Stay away from it as I bought 2 of them and they both do the same thing.
2,This book is as realistic as unicorns!,I had to read reviews to see what I was missing and I still don't get it. The hero is no 16 year old. He reminds me of McGiver on horseback. Descriptions are the only realistic element to the book. I'll pass on the rest of the triology.
2,Too much praise,"The reviews of this work leads one to believe it is a great piece of fiction. How it won the National Book Award is beyond reason. Though McCarthy paints a good picture in one's mind, the content does not flow well. The story is boring and leaves one hoping the end will come soon. The love story is not believable and goes nowhere. The book moves too slowly and lacks suspense. Reading this after any great classic is a mistake for it leaves one wondering what all the praise is about."
5,book - All the Pretty Horses,Good book. Purchased for summer reading reguirement for high School. Will keep for next kids coming up through those classes.
3,This Midwestern gal doesn't miss the good ol' cowboy days!,"I'm not knocking this book at all ... but I had a heck of a time starting it. Once I got into it, it was ok. It's not the best read which really disappointed me as I had been waiting for years to read this book. I also had a hard time reading it because of the lack of quotation marks, puncuations and so forth. I also lost track of who was who in the story. Otherwise, his description of Texas and Mexico, the lonely life as a cowboy, waxes lyrical. I would recommend this book for those who really likes cowboys and westerns. It just didn't appeal to me very much!"
3,Slow going,"It's not that I didn't enjoy the story, but I feel it could have been told in 1/2 the words. It just didn't keep my attention and took about a month of forcing myself to stay into it to finish. Also, if you don't know Spanish, you may want to keep a dictionary handy. It could be frustrating otherwise."
2,It wasn't as good as some people are claiming,"I had to read this book as one of my summer reading assignments for AP English. I doubt I would have even finished this book if I didn't have to. Personally, I was annoyed by McCarthy's style. Many of his sentences would either be really short (especially the dialouge) or a paragraph long. It seemed to me like the author would try to throw in a few really long lines once in a while just to be pretensious. Additionally, the style of the novel (especially the first 15 pages) was confusing. There were shifts in time and setting without even a break in the paragraph. I also didn't understand McCarthy's reasoning for leaving out many punctuation marks including quotation marks, some commas, and apostraphes. I may have been biased against this book from the start though because I don't like reading westerns."
2,One Way Trip to the Glue Factory,"I am a big McCarthy fan but I was not engaged by this story. The writing, as always, is phenomenal. But that wasn't enough to pull the story through for me or keep me interested. It pains me to write this review because I have read some truly great work by this writer. But All the Pretty Horses is not one of his best, not by a long shot.I cannot recommend this novel."
4,unexpectedly mesmerizing,"I picked up this book, having seen it listed for readers who enjoyed ""Cold Mountain"". I was stunned by what I consider pretty lush prose, considering the barren landscape and lifestyle McCarthy is trying to describe. The stylistic choices in this novel (the use of Spanish, no quotations) that seem to have bothered others (and in ""The God of Small Things"" drove me batty) seem perfectly matched to the story itself; the starkness of the very appearance of the page matches the story. McCarthy did a wonderful job, in my opinion, of showing us people who just manage to keep going - they persever in spite of all the obstacles. I loved this book, and plan to follow up with the other two volumes in the trilogy."
4,Spanish 101,Excellent reading. Some people complain about the use of Spanish in parts of the book. I think it ads to the realism. You can log on to cormacmccarthy.com to get the translations for all three books in the border trilogy.
2,Lacks romance!!!,"This was a great book, very detailed on all aspects except on the romantic side. He used more words to describe plains and grasses than Cole and Alejandra's relationship. However, the moral lesson was very realistic and moving."
2,"Magnificent story, poorly written.","McCarthy's intentional misuse of written English is annoying and doesn't lend anything to the story. The decision to omit quotation marks is particularly perplexing since it diminishes the immediacy of the tale. The Spanish language quotes are excellent for adding flavor, but too lengthy and non-contextual for those of us who aren't bilingual. Attributes are insufficient to keep track of who is speaking. The story is one of the finest I've read- and I've read a lot of excellent books- but it's a shame the author didn't respect his readers enough to write so that his work was a pleasure to read."
4,School assignments usually bite - this one wasn't so bad,"I was required to read this book this past year as a school assignment. First off it's rare for such a new book (it was only published 14 years ago) to be a school assignment (well at my school it is). I suppose that says something for this book. It's the easiest read but not bad. Rather boring in places. It leaves a lot of the story up in the air a little which I didn't like so much, and I definably found the end rather rushed. All in all, not my favorite book, but a good book in general."
2,An excuse for a book,"There are several books which I recall reading, being an english professor, none of which are this aggrivating. There are several objects of my disliking contained in the composition: nullified usage of quotations, run-on sentences, and the overwhelming ammount of conjunctions. Did this fellow fail English 101?"
3,All the Pretty Horses,"I read the book, but don't recommend it. Why the two cowboys took off was not clear to me. They weren't doing anything constructive, like cattle drive, and had no destination in mind. Just took off and endured the desert.I did not like the way he broke horses. I've seen horses broke to saddle by the great Ray Hunt NEVER anything like hobbling them. I thought it was a pointless adventure. The more I read the less I liked the characters."
2,All the Pretty Horses,"I was disappointed in the style of this book. I had just read ""Water for Elephants"" and was blown away. The reviews I read lead me to this author and the above book. The story line is good however he is slow to develop it. I appreciate discriptive text however a paragraph (or more) it seems to descibbe a dry river bed is a bit much especially when there is one on every page. Alas the last 1/3 of the book will go unread. And I will search for the next W.F.E."
2,All the Pretty Horses,"I thought the book was rather hard to understand and extremely slow-moving. The author didn't use quotation marks when characters spoke, and he used Spanish in dialogue. I think that the book was disappointing."
1,Ugh!,"I'm not commenting on the book, because I put this book down after the first page. Why? It would be nice if I could read the book clearly. As in, bloody quotation marks, commas, little details such as that. No, that wouldn't be hip and cool, that would be conforming to this silly tradition of (can you believe it?) legible writing. Oy vey."
1,Sucks,"This book sucks,way to much description. Just kept on turning pages without reading them. Do not buy this book!!! Can not believe a 16 and 17 year travel throught Mexico and knew so much.. Hard to believe he branded himself with a gun barrel to stop the bleeding. How would a 17 year old know how to do that."
1,And... and... and... One too many!!,"Ugggh! This has to be one of the worst books I've ever read in all my years of reading young adult literature! For one, what's with McCarthy not putting in quotes?? I mean, I knows it's a style and all, but I never really did know what was going on!! And the ANDS... uhh, I've never seen so many in ONE book! It was absolute craziness! I wouldn't recommend this book to ANYONE!!"
3,guess I'm not ready for this yet?,"I found this book an effort to read. Confusing at the start, yet did grab me midway but I was ready to discard with about 1/3 left, but thought better of it and completed. Yes, his writing is very descriptive and captures the essence of every sense the reader needs to be placed within the story. However, it just seemed to skip and jumble along, the ending wasn't anything like the many my mind conjured up, it wasn't really anything special at all...Grady continued on rambling as did the book. I perhaps need to read another of his works to get a better grasp of the talent of this writer, as so many have applauded his style."
2,Hohum.,"I've been told that other McCarthy novels are better, but having started with this one, I have not been inspired to explore his oeuvre any further. My annoyance with this book probably has something to do with its being vastly overrated. I picked it up expecting, based on what I'd heard, to be astonished on every page, only to come away from it bored and puzzled. What is everyone so excited about? The plot is thoroughly conventional, the prose is some kind of dried-up, left-over concoction made up of one part Faulkner and two parts Hemingway, and McCarthy has a bad habit of constantly singing the praises (in his chiseled, understated way) of his insipid hero, John Grady Cole -- what a horseman! -- all based on an antiquated and irrelevant code of manhood, or something. Who cares?"
3,Not my favorite,"Cormack McCarthy's All the Pretty Horses seemed somewhat too affected for my tastes. His hero is somewhat one-dimensional and there is a sense of a desperate search for significance within the novel - in the end most of the themes appear trite and I could not convince myself that this novel was very significant at all. McCarthy's The Crossing is a much better novel - a more finely tuned existential treatise, but still with too many stale ideas"
3,Skip the movie,"The book conveys a sense of personality and depth that actors never could. And Penelope Cruz's insufferable preening does nothing for the character she attempts to portray. You will find the book steamier, more seductive and far more believable than the film."
3,Good Read But Some Problems,"I read this book after I read No Country for Old Men and was disappointed by the slow pace. Language and the description of the setting are fascinating however the long dialogue in Spanish, while authentic, were annoying because you felt that you were missing something important in the exchanges. Also there was a certain deus ex machine aspect to the story near the end that I was mystified by. In the end it was worth the read but kind of shoulder shrugger in the end."
1,Paid for new book got a used one!,I paid for a new book and received a used book. This was to be a Christmas present!Do not buy!
1,An OK book with distracting grammar,"I love to read, and I usually enjoy my summer reading assignments. However, I found All the Pretty Horses very hard to get into. The first few chapters are very slow, and frankly, quite boring. The rest of the book is dizzyingly action-packed. There is also a lot of dialogue in Spanish, which makes some of the story hard to follow if you don't speak Spanish.McCarthy also has some grammatical eccentricities that I found very distracting. The book begins with pronouns that lack antecedents, completely lacks quotation marks (not even dashes a la Steinbeck), and has the longest run on sentences I have ever seen."
2,"Interesting story, difficult to read, see the movie?","I almost gave up on this book after the first chapter featured several paragraph-long run on sentences with no punctuation. I was determined to try though. Once I got used to the almost non-existent editing I was able to enjoy the story. It is a challenge, but the reward is an interesting glimpse of the cowboy life. I'm not sure the effort was worth it, though. Note to writers--employ editors so that your story isn't lost due to hard to read prose! It added nothing to the book to create a new ""style"" and made reading very cumbersome and frustrating. This is one of the few times that I wish I had just watched the movie instead."
4,Great Book by a Great Author,Cormac McCarthy is one of our greatest living authors. I love Southern Gothic style and he executes it brilliantly. This book is part of a trilogy that is challenging if you do not speak Spanish since so much of the action takes place in Mexico. I used online translation sites to get the most out of it. It took extra effort but was worth it.
5,Wow.,"This book was assigned reading in an English course I took about a year ago. It blew my mind. The writing style is very simplistic, even more so than Hemmingway, in that there is very little punctuation. There are no quotations, but they really aren't needed. Once the main character, John Grady Cole, finds his way to Mexico, there is some Spanish, but it isn't neccessary to know the language, as there is no exposition in it and a decent explanation is given soon after. It also helps to make you feel a stranger in this land, as Cole is. What is tragic is that Miramax has cut the original four hour film translation of this masterpiece down to a piddling hour-forty-five. Read this. You won't regret it."
4,A coming of age tale of a young man's adventures in Mexico,"All the Pretty Horses, winner of the National Book Award and National Book Critics Circle Award, is fiction of the highest calibur. The story recants the travels of John Grady, a boy from Texas, looking for adventure and his future in Mexico. The journey to and within Mexico parallels the young Texan's own inner quest and search for self. Admittedly the book is lathargic in the beginning, but a particularly poignant passage in the last third of the novel in which an older Mexican woman offers her hard earned wisdom regarding life is well worth the wait. McCarthy has written a rare book which avoids cliche, predictable plot evolution and merely guides readers along as the climax methodically builds. Events and misfortune befall the unemotive John Grady yet he continues in stride, not out of hero bravado but rather because that is the only response he can muster. In the end, life has shaped John Grady into a man and his journey is complete"
5,A great book,"I find it amazing that some of the reviews I've read here have found McCarthy's prose difficult.It is his supreme achievement that he is able to intensify his storytelling and brought such vividness and economy to his scenes like no other writer.This is done through a hard, laconic and spare style that allows him to roam and stretch his story into the epic without unnecessary length.In the hands of hacks,this story would have ballooned to 700 pages but McCarthy kept it down to a lean 300 without sacrificing tone.What was it that Hemingway said about prose; that it should be architecture and not interior decorating.This book is verbal cinema on a grand scale."
5,Just read it,"I don't know what to say, except that it's almost shocking to read something so beautiful and tragic. The book, like life itself, is full of wonder and full of pain.How can an author write such a book? I don't know, but good for us that he did."
4,All The Pretty Horses.,"I found the book ""All The Pretty Horses"" by Cormac McCarthy to be an exciting and compelling story of a young boy going out into the world and doing what he loves best, and that is to ride horses. On his journey, he comes across dangers, love, and friendship, as he learn that the new world he has come and love is not what it always seems to be."
3,challenging,"Clearly ""genius"" is in the eye of the beholder. Sometimes reading through even a classic is slogging through muck, but ya make yourself do it, cause you know it's an established classic. I felt like I was reading great writing, but did find it fairly difficult to understand in places. Even after rereading passages (especially dialogue-who said what), it seemed not terribly clear. The genius of his style (if that's what it was) was lost on me, although I did like it allright. Also, while I appreciated the authenticity of Spanish dialogue, I felt like I could have been missing something significant, which annoyed me (I broke down finally and used a Spanish dictionary). Thought the story was brilliant, and the characters soulful. There do exist in this world precocious people, but John Grady Cole must be the most maturely drawn 16 year old in the history of literature. 18 woulda made a little more sense. I'd say it's a great book that I only liked a whole lot."
3,A Finely Honed Bone,"My least favorite of McCarthy's works. I found this diorama and even the words he used extremely fine and spare, like the elegance of a bone found bleached white in the desert, but I personally prefer the rich gothic settings and language of his earlier work. Despite my dislove of the Border Trilogy McCarthy is still one of my all time favorite writers."
4,"I liked ""The ""Road"" much better.","He sure writes a pretty story, but in the end it all seemed like there was no meaning to it all. A boy has an adventure, and then it's over. That's it? I guess I missed the point."
