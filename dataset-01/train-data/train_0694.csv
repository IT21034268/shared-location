2,Energetic,This 10 minute solution DVD is very fast and hyper-active for me. she goes to fast that I couldn't keep up with her. My suggestion is that if you want to have your heart rate up tp the sky and you energy is equal to 10 tablespoon sugar this is your best fit. I love the 10 minutes solution workouts but this is not one of my favs.
2,"Unfortunately, not for me...","I bought this DVD last year and have used it once so far. Here I would like to mention that I am not new to workout DVDs and I have been pretty regular with a couple of them in the past (one was Karen Voight) - even got results that I was happy with. I wanted to try something new and ordered three - this being one of them. I ended up disliking all three of my new choices (the two others were by Tami Lee and Denise Austin, respectively). This one does come with a band - flimsy as it is, it works ok. After having been disappointed by these three poor (boring and dull) choices, I have recently joined group exercise classes at the gym."
4,Strength Training Using Resistance Band,"This is a great way to get some strength training in especially if you haven't been active for awhile. I like that the sessions are done in 10 minute increments. This way you can break your routine up based on how busy your daily schedule is. Also, you can easily target areas that you may consider your problem areas. Another plus is that the DVD comes with a band and you can use that instead of purchasing weights. Bet you're thinking ""how effective is a band"". It is very effective. You will feel the resistance as if you were using actual weights. I always feel my muscles tightening as I do the workouts. Nothing painful. More like the burn that you hear instructors speak of. Finally, the instructor is encouraging. She appears to enjoy the workouts as she does them. I also feel that her routines are pretty easy to pick up. I normally watch exercise workouts at least once to get an idea of what I will be doing. Give it a try. You may like it."
4,Great Workout - Harder Than You Would Think!,"I'm pretty sedentary because I work at a computer all day, though I do walk and garden whenever I can. So I'd probably rate myself as a beginning exerciser. This DVD and accompanying band give me a nice stretch/wake-up if I just do a 10-minute routine, and an exhausting (in a good way) thorough workout if I do the whole 50 minutes. I think it's great for those of us who work at a desk, as the band helps you stretch out all the muscles that have contracted while you were hunched over. It helps me be more aware of my posture afterward too. I also think the strength I'm gaining will help me out in my daily life, with chores, gardening and just generally feeling more fit. Though the workout isn't intended to be aerobic, my heart rate and respiration definitely go up on the longer sets just from the intensity of the exercises."
3,"Some innovative combinations, but moves too quickly for beginners","Amy Bento is a good at combination moves so you get the most out of your time, however she moves too quickly from one exercise to the next...there is not enough time to get the band in place. Also, there is no instruction on proper form, therefore beginners will struggle. People who have been exercising with a band will probably like this one. Beginners or people who have not exercised in a while should start out slower,and with an instructor who teaches you how to perform the moves in order to prevent injury. I have put this one on my ""try it again"" list for later."
5,Great DVD,"This DVD has five fabulous different 10 minute workouts. I am really glad I purchased this, well worth the money."
3,Just OK - Not Challenging Enough,"I own all of Amy's workouts and I find her very inspiring. This workout provides some ideas on how to use a resistance band and would be a good one to take along when traveling, but that's where it ends for me. It is not challenging, the muscles don't feel worked and the segments are not long enough. The exercises themselves are ok, but it's definitely a beginner's workout, especially in comparison with her other videos."
5,Great DVD! I love it!,This is a very good DVD! I can't believe how much of a work out just ten minutes is. It gets my heart going! Thanks!
3,Moves to fast,"This is my first video from this series, and I'm disappointed. She moves way to fast for me. She was half way through before I even got the band placed. I wish that I had bought a different video, but I'll keep trying."
4,Good Value for the Price Point,"For the money, this unit does a good job. With a gigabit connection, image backs are now quite practical over the network, and daily backups of critical directories like My Documents can be automatically scheduled so they are painless. And I have found any amount of pain will eventually cause you to stop taking regular backups. My unit is fairly quiet, although to be fair I have it in a computer room that already has a pretty high noise level. I also appreciate the plugin software apps for Bit Torrent and Media Server. On the negative side, the firmware and support software must be upgraded from the support site before it all works reliably. The driver carriers are somewhat flimsy, I think a better solution would be carrier-less drive bays, but I understand that is found only on much more expensive NAS, at least so far. All in all I am very happy with this unit and I plan to buy another when I fill this one."
2,Dimensions Not As Stated,"The dimensions are not as large as they say. The dimensions of the actual screen is 12"" x 16"" x 1/2"". The stated dimensions, ""16.1 x 19.8 x 2.9 are the dimensions of the box the filter arrived in! There is a 6"" overlap on my 21"" screen!"
2,Unhappy,Bought the black frame standard filter to remove the glare on the computer screen. Still have glare. It didn't eliminate the glare. I am not happy with product.
3,"An interesting ""how he got here"" book","If you are fan of Daniel Quinn (I am) then you will be interested to see his background. His monastic life seems more like an attempt to hide from the problems of the world than a desire to serve God, and he recognizes it. If you want to read the story of how a man could get from feeling as powerless and victimized as the rest of the world to finally seeing alight at the end of the tunel, this is your book. If you want to know what the light looks like for yourself: read Ishmael, The Story of B or My Ishmael."
5,A insightful book about a insightful man.,"If you want to know about the man behind Ishmael, The Story of B, My Ishmael,and Beyond Civilization. Quinn reveals his life story and ideas, which of course has led to Ishmael.A great book!!!"
5,"Answers a few more questions, gives a few more insights",Quinn details his spiritual journey towards his current beliefs and takes us along with him. An interesting tale about the personal journey of the author of the revolutionary book Ishmael.
5,"For the price, it earns a 5","Some of the peg hooks are a bit off, clearly leaning to one side or another, but overall, I'm extremely pleased with them. They seem to be thinner than the standard peg hooks, but that actually works out well for me. I'll likely purchase more in the near future.Update: I have been so pleased with the hooks that I ordered another set of 100."
5,Works good,Worked as expected for some metal hooks. Seems like the same stuff that they sell at the big box stores only this is way cheaper.
4,Good garage mechanic tool...,"This is a great tool for the typical garage mechanic needing to work on a fuel injected Ford or GM vehicle. The glass lens seems to hold up to fuel spills fine. This fuel pressure gauge is the same as the Actron 7838. In fact the package had the Actron logo on the back, as well as SPX. I also have the OTC fuel pressure kit but this one is small enough to fit in a typical tool box, whereas the OTC is not. The package is not labeled as to where it is made, but the quality is pretty good."
5,Sterling silver beauty,"This bracelet is so pretty, delicate, yet sturdy, well made, yet comfortable. It was so reasonably priced I was not sure what to expect, but it is very pretty, and the entire process was positive. I will definetly be a repeat customer and recommend them to my friends."
2,I dont remember buying this...,Idk why i bought this or if i did buy it.....I cannot access the memory of having this is doing anything with it.... -.-.... ummmm yeah.. so idk what to say about it... its a chain.......... what can really go wrong with it...
5,cute ankel bracelet,"Plain classic silver bracelet. I wear it 24-7 so it is durable. I wear it in the pool, in the shower, to work out, to mow the grass, at the beach, as well as when I dress up so it is also versatile."
3,Confused,"This book left me confused. I found the story-line interesting insomuch as the time period it takes place in was interesting, the characters were engaging in personality, and the weaving of the gods of the time works well. The main plot worked for a while but about half way through I started to get lost in what was going on, who was a positive character and who was negative. It also lost it's way somewhere toward the end.I would recommend the book to anyone who is an avid Doctor Who fan and is interested in reading all the novels. However, if you're a casual reader and only interested in more characteristic stories, I would avoid this book."
5,311 Grassroots Tab Book,"This is a great tab book, and a great assessment of the album. It has all the songs, and it even correct me a bunch of times. Brand new book, and it was again, a great deal."
3,"Works, but not elegant.","I tried another card that had a much better interface than this card, it showed you the serial number of drives instead of merely the bus #. Unfortunately that card had issues with the bios drivers. On this one I was a little afraid that I might mirror the blank drive over the full drive. Once I had established for sure that my data drive was bus #0 it copied over fine, and seems to be problem free. If used in a new install I'm sure it would be easier. Would be nice if it included an ide raid as well, a feature I've seen on similarly priced cards"
5,Great card,I bought 3 of these cards for my machines in the house. All worked flawlessly to run DVD burners. Would buy again.
2,Ok but is not real RAID,Could not get it to work out of the box with Linux. After doing research I found the chipset is really FakeRaid. I ending up getting a 3Ware card which is true RAID and works great with little effort for setup.
3,subtle.,"chicks really love this scent. it's true, there have been numerous studies and women respond favorably to the scent of baby powder. so, there you go."
4,Well Presented Medical Information,Easy to follow format. Easy reading. Graphs in the appendix could be bigger. Outstanding information for personal health.
5,"Great book, great condition","This book arrived as ordered, in great condition. I haven't used any of the recipes yet, but I have looked through the book and I believe the recipes will be very helpful in preparing ""square meals."""
1,Don't bother,A very disappointing read. There are so many opinions expressed in this book without further explanation ... it is pitiful. Example: the author claims we should not use the natural thyroid medication Armour. Why not? No further explanation is given. This is extremely annoying and therefore a complete waste of time. This book is going into the recycling bin.
1,moderation of old program to keep up sales with societal change,"I feel that Dr. Schwarzbein is just interested in $$. Her old program doesnt sell that well anymore due to the fact that alot of people started eating GOOD carbs and went away from high protein/fat diets. She then had to modify the program to keep up with what people would actually read and buy. The whole adrenal burnout jargon sounds like a lot of hoopla to me and the way she says you have to be careful how you cook meat fat in order to not DAMAGE it, is just a tedious task that people do not need in their lives. PLEASE!!!! To me she lost professional credibility with this one."
1,What a piece of crap,"If I could give it Negative 5 stars I would, or at least 0 stars. Maybe this could work for you if you eat unhealthy (as some people like this book), but what the hell happened to Dr Schwarzbein and her ""principles""?????? She did a complete 180 from her other books: The Schwarzbein Principle and The Schwarzbein Principle II. She was all about eating lower carb in those books and gave a great story on how she came to discover why eating that way was better, along with eating real butter and cream. Then in this book you'd be eating like 400 grams of carbs a day. It's like the media finally got to her and she wanted to go with what was ""in"" instead of tried and true science on lowering your carbs. Complete waste of time and money. Stick to her first books and anything by Atkins and Dr Eades."
4,Good ideas,"I've tried the program before and had trouble. I really committed to it, and did great. My problem was trying to eat a midmorning and midafternoon snack because I work with people. I admit that I felt better on weekends when I could spread my meals out. Good ideas for gluten and dairy free menus."
5,My dr. recommended this book,"I searched out this book after my dr. made the recommendation. Now I'm working on the transition - and so far, I'm enjoying eating again, and have lost both weight & inches."
3,Read The Schwarzbein Principle first,"This is an excellent program and has helped me to feel better and lose weight on a diet I can maintain. It combines the best of low carb diets with lots of vegetables and some healthy carbs like fruits and grains. The cookbook is also excellent. I read The Program first and thought it was great until I realized I was not sure what to eat and what to avoid. Then I got The Schwarzbein Principle and found it MUCH easier to read and implement. I do not think there is much else to gain from reading The Program except some of the information on exercise and specialty diets (like gluten-free). However, the diets are downloadable for free on her website. I found The Program somewhat confusing and The Principle much more clear and concise."
1,she should make a christmas list instead,and ask for clothes cause she's obviously missing them on the cover of this CD. haha
2,hahaha,"THIS CD IS NOT ALL THAT GREAT FOR STARTERS SHE CANT REALLY KEEP UP WIT DA BEAT SHE CANT HOLD A NOTE AND THERE IS PLENTY MORE I WOULD HAVE TO SAY WINTER WONDERLAND AND HEY SNATA ARE THE BEST SONGS ON THE ALBUM AND THEM 2 SONGS AINT EVEN THAT GREAT, BUT I AM USALLY AN ASHANT I FAN I LOVED HER FIRST ALBUM THAT WAS SELF TITLED AND I LOVE THE SONG RAIN ON ME ON HER 2ND ALBUM CHAPTER 2 BUT I HAVE TO SAY ASHANTIS CHRISTMAS ALBUM IS THE WORST OUT OF ALL THEM CAN SHE CANT REALLY SING AND IT SHOWS TRUELY THAT SHE CANT"
5,Ashanti brings it!,"Soothing & relaxing. Look out for Ashanti's future performances from this album, because you'll be sold as soon as you see them! It's like a female Nat King Cole album, for real!!"
1,"If I could rate below one star, I would.","This CD sucks. The music industry is no longer making music based on talent but looks alone. Ashanti is as much a singer as I am. I actually think that I sound better.Don't waste your money! If someone gives you this as a gift -- do not open, return immediately."
2,It was catchy,"I admit ashanti does not have the vocals or whitney, mariah or christina but her songs are catchy. This album seemed rushed and put together all the songs were catchy the only goood one on the cd is Hey Santa.In some of her songs she really tries to sing above her rate which is a nono.instead of buing this album buy her first cd ashanti all the songs on it are catchy and easy to listen to thiers no bad songs on that cd my fav song was voodoo it shouldve been a single.Her second album was garbage .hope this helps"
2,NOT Worth IT,I was doubting whether to purchase this cd and now I wish I hadn't!! I tried giving her the benefit of the doubt but I sorry this is a BIG disappointment. She could have done alot better. You might want to pick some one else's Xmas cd if you truly want to feel the essence of XMAS
1,"""This Christmas"".....stay AWAY from purchacing this album!","I bought this album thinking that it would be cute, although I had heard bad things about Ashanti's voice. Well those bad things came true to me when I first heard this.Her voice is a joke! She totally puts no effort into this and obviously is not a good singer at all. iF THERE WERE 0 STARS I would rate it that for real.On the other hand, I picked up Whitney Houston's ""ONE WISH: The Holiday Album"" last week and I was BLOWN AWAY. You can't even compare the two!Last word--Do NOT buy this album it is a waste of money!"
2,Terrible,"This CD wallows in the seas of mediocre. I was very disappointed with this album. I do not enjoy the sound of Ashanti's upper register and this is what she relies on for the first several songs. Most songs I couldn't wait to be over. They are repetitive and boring and grate on your nerves. There are 2 tolerable songs on this CD, ""This Christmas"" and ""Silent Night"". These tracks standout but don't expect much from this CD. Save your money and buy a true holiday classic instead of this money waster. Ashanti should stick to what she does best - singing the hooks on a Ja Rule song."
1,WHAT?? THIS SHOULD BE A SINGLE NOT ALBUM,"first of all, the whole cd lasted 29 minutes!!!! and all songs are under produced.. u will know if u listen to this cd.. all songs sounded like cheap homemade computer music and yet selling at $16.98!!"
2,WOW,"Ashanti...what more can I say, she needs to recognize the degree of her talent and try to make it better. I would guess thats what she's trying to do, but it sounds all the same. Her ""ooh babys"" sound just as annoying. She can sing, thats a fact, just like saying Bush is President but there are certain notes some singers just can't hit, she sounds like she's straining...very hard. The cd is ok, yes ok, just like any other cd she's brought out, but not refreshing or exceptional. There's nothing different about it, nothing that makes it stick out from the rest. I wouldn't buy the cd, seriously, i'd spend the money on something else. I'm yet to listen to Whitney Houston's but i'm sure when i do, it will be better. You can't possibly go wrong with an old favorite."
1,Can you make no stars an option in (dis) honor of this CD?,"She's even more talented than Aaliyah.Are you bloody serious?! She wouldn't even have ANY kind of career if the true ""Princess of Hip Hop and R&B"", Aaliyah had not passed, and I'm not alone in saying that she is TRULY missed.And comparing Ashanti's Chistmas CD to Whitney Houston's, even at her worst, is like comparing a Yugo to an Aston Martin. I mean sure, she's great to look at, but come on. If you want to even go as far as comparing her to Britney, at least Britney has stage presence. Have you seen Ashanti trying to dance? It was painful to watch the video for her song ""Happy"". She is NO WAY in Whitney's league.This cd is a hot, steaming pile of crap. She butchers the classic ""This Christmas"". I wouldn't even get money for this at a used CD shop. Save your money or buy Whitney's CD if you want to hear a TRUE singer."
2,skip it,I bought this CD last night and gave it away this morning. Ashanti's limitations as a singer are completley exposed on this album. She's trying to sing great and beloved songs with a voice that just isn't suited for it. I think the producers realized this so they orchestrated each song to sound like a slow jam club mix. I'm sorry I wasted my money on this really poor products. I have to say it's the worst Christmas album of the year.
2,Ummm... I really dont have nuttin to say on the cd,"Okay sumthing is different wit this cd it sounds like she singin on a karyote machine and burned the cd. It doesnt sound to professional at least not to me. And i'm not sayin that cuz i dont like her I just wanted to hear her christmas album and its stinks really bad. She doesnt have vocals 4 this type of music. She needs fast music and lots of background singers because shes not gettin it. And she cant dance jus 4 the record :) And one more thing you cant compare whitney to ashanti no matter what whitneys personal life is she can sing 100,000,000,000,000,000 times Ashanti. Thanks all I gotta say buh-bye :)"
5,MUCH better than Whitney's Christmas album,"I used to dislike Ashanti, but now I realize that she's the most talented female r&b singer out there. She's even more talented than Aaliyah. Anyway, this album is MUCH better than Whitney's horrific Christmas album, which is bad enough to turn anyone into a Scrooge. Whitney's voice has deteriorated big time; but Ashanti's is so full bodied and robust and able to hit just about any note. If you really want to do the right thing this holiday season, you'll pick this up. Ashanti is, was, and always will be the princess of R and B."
3,Nice CD - Not worth it though,"It's a good CD as far as christmas music goes. However, 25 minutes of music is definetly not worth the price. This is just Ashanti and the record label seeing some easy money. Definetly not worth it, though she does do a good job."
1,Immature,"I really wanted to by this cd today but after listening to it I realized that it was done with no creativity and once again she is singing out of her range. Ashanti has talent but Irv Gotti is making this girl reallly look bad. The music sounds like it was done for young kids. Ashanti, is pretty, and has talent but she needs to work with someone else to help accentuate what she has. Except for the first track which was good the rest is bad. I would love to see her work with another group of producers that knows how to market her talent. Sorry Ashanti, you need to evaluate what you are doing before you look simply foolish. This industry will eat you alive!!!! She needs to take sometime and realize she is being used for a quick buck."
1,Ashanti's Dreaded Christmas,From the snippets I heard this CD is trash. I have a few words: NOT! Actually I have one word. GARBAGE
3,A easy-to-swallow Christmas album,"This album is has a nice, jazzy feel. Something that is essential. There are little tingles of bells, and minor instruemnts, but nothing that makes it seem ""boxed up"". There is no ""power house"" vocals, or some earth-shattering singing. But it wouldn't fit. It has a nice feel. Something that you would listen to when you are having some hot cocoa, reading a christmas book, and bundled up in your christmas quilt.On a ascale from one to ten for a christmas album I give it a 4 . But for a MUSIC album, i would give it a 3."
1,Not the season to be jolly.,"This cd is horrible. She misses tons of notes, and can't sing in tune to save her life. This is a pathetic excuse for a cd. Horrible. 1 Star is more than this CD deserves."
4,Good Christmas Music,"This CD is a great addition to my Christmas music. I liked the smooth, laid back vocals and the way Ashanti didn't try to do to much. She delivered a good one !"
2,UMMMMM,She could have done way better than this. It sounds like this album was rushed and recorded in a basement with cheap equipment. Ashanti is really a good songwriter and she's cool but this album really didnt get it for me..I was very dissappointed c'mon girl u could have done better... I reccommend Mariah Carey Christmas instead of this!!!
2,LOL. This is NOT gonna bring You a Merry Christmas. Trust me. 2.5 stars.,"I love Ashanti as well as the next shallow music-listener, but this is ridiculous. I would pay 2 bucks and no shipping for this because I enjoyed one song, thoroughly and another one, half-heartedly.Christmastime Again (classic X-Mas tune)Hey, Santa (good...enough)And some other tunes here are passable....but...The vocals are weak and somewhat strained and YES, She hits the wrong note in a song. I swear, that Day, I wanted to retreat into My own shell when I heard it. I really was gonna leave my Bro's house. But something crazy made me stay. And endure. I could've used ear plugs, People! Why weren't You there??Allows You to have a very average X-Mas.2.5 stars."
5,this is the best album yet and she is way better than beyonc,i swear yall be hating on ashanti she's fine and she can sing really good she is way better than beyonce and aaliyah put together only reason why yall like aaliyah so much is because she died so stop hating on her im a true ashanti fan and this is a realllllllly good album i wish i could rate a hundred stars then i would beyonce is (...) ugly and aint got no hair plus ashanti sold way more albums than beyonce in its first week knocked beyonces album down to the last spot comeon ashanti fans lets be supportive and buy those albums i know i got three of each one she made
5,Beautiful,"I love Ashanti's Christmas album. It's so much better than other ones put out by R&B singers, like 3LW and B2K. It's really old school sounding and there's NO sign of Murder Inc. on it at ALL..not even on the back of the CD! (""The Inc."") You need to listen to some of these clips. Also check out the entire This Christmas, since she really lets her voice go wild at the end! It's off da chain! I recommend it to anyone who likes the old school soul Christmas songs and any Ashanti fan, of course!"
1,XMAS? MORE LIKE HALLOWEEN CD,"THE CD WAS JUST FULL OF MISSED NOTES, AND HORRIBLE RENDITIONS OF ONCE BEAUTIFUL SONGS. TRY AGAIN ASHANTI"
2,"We Dont Want An ""Ah Baby, Ooh Baby"" Christmas, Ashanti","I didnt even waste time saying NO to buying this CD after hearing the previews here at amacon. She really needs to stick to those little fluke songs she has been singing. ""Ah Baby and Ooh Baby"" wont do for a christmas album... also i want to say to all of those who were beating down on Whitney Houston's Christmas Album, --- compare that to this... that is NO COMPARISON AT ALL---Whitney, even not at her absolute best (which is very close to being) is WAY BETTER and i was VERY SHOCKED because i was expecting to hear crap and i heard PERFECTIONI Definitely recommend One Wish By Whitney Houston as a CD to make everything a little brighter...no a LOT BRIGHTER this christmas"
1,This is just awful!,"This CD is unbelievably bad! To begin with, at 29:28 minutes long, it's a shameless attempt at making money! I was unable to listen to most of it. I'm sorry someone wasted their money to buy this for me."
5,I love the christmas medly video she has,"I aint bought the album yet but i love the christams medly of hey santa, It's xmas time again, and chestnuts roasting!"
3,Ashanti singing could have been better...,i like the album but her high notes i'm not really liking. she sound better when she not trying to hit those high notes but the album is good i'm a fan of her music and i'm gonna always support her i just sometimes wish her voice could be more powerfull like beyonce... but i give it 3 stars good work ashanti...
1,Arguably one of the Worst Artists Ever,Ashanti is fastly on pace to go down as One of the Worst Artsts Ever.She messes these track badly.for all the Hype She gets you'd think maybe She would cash it in for some Studio tricks to enhance that lemon of a voice She got.
4,For specific purposes,This book is very well presented and clear; very useful for students of architecture in their early years of study. It covers a comprehensive range of words used frequently in the discourse of architecture.
4,Haiti Window flag,Came in on time and hangs by a thin string. My roommate is using to decorate her car on the rear view window and it fits great and the string is holding up very well.
5,WHAT???????????,"I don't know what the previous reviewer is talking about, but Dr. Gardner's Stories About The Real World are wonderful examples of real life problem-solving for kids. There's nothing about sex or sex with fathers. That's just ludicrous! I use these stories in social skills groups to help children cope with common problems. The kids remember the stories and actually use the ideas in their lives."
5,Great book for kids and parents,"I used this book for nearly 30 years as a Child Therapist. I found the stories appropriate for kids of many ages. They present real issues, with logical, reasonable solutions in a way that kids can understand. He present stories that parents can read and discuss with younger children, or let older kids read them then talk about. Dr. Gardner's companion books are equally good."
1,Slip N Slide,"For me, this mat was a failure. Sweating and staying put for me are the worst issues w/ yoga mats. I could not keep my hands or feet in place from the get go with this mat. It was also very heavy and it just overall was not the mat for me. I did return it for a full refund however which is why I continue to purchase through Amazon. The peace of mind in knowing that if I am unsatisfied with a purchase they have my back is second to none."
5,Great Mat,"I have used this mat for over 2 months now and absolutely love it! It is sticky enough to hold positions and I have improved my downward dog because of it. However, I have noticed that when I start sweating I slip a little but not as much as the other mats that I own. This is lightweight and easy to carry which is another thing I love about it."
2,Not what I expected for the price I paid.,"I tried to use this mat on a carpet floor and it did not work well. It kept moving and getting all wrinkled up, so it may only work well if it is used on hard floors. I don't plan on taking it to yoga class since it is too heavy to carry. I purchase it to use it at home on a carpet floor but that did not work well."
4,Great Yoga Mat,I am new at Yoga but the mat is better than the mat at the gym and they have great colors.
4,Jade Harmony Yoga mat,"I purchased this mat because I was told it is ""stickier"" than most, i.e, meaning that even with excessive perspiration, one wouldn't slip. The mat is sticky, alright, but I find that halfway through class I am still slipping. However, it seems to be a great mat otherwise - the natural rubber gives it a sturdier, different feel than most other mats I've tried. I like that they plant a tree with each yoga mat purchased."
1,Disappointed,"Sorry, but this book is off the mark. As a grandfather if you don't own a dog, or take your grandchild fishing this book will not make sense. There are only five pages so I consider the book over priced."
4,From Small things to great music,"I had purchased this CD with the intention of getting one song, From small things big things one day come. I was pleasently suprised to find so much good music loaded onto one CD. From Crawling from the Wreckage to Slipping Away and some of the gems in between, I found the album to ROCK. Covering songs from Elvis Costello, Phil Spector, and several others, Edmunds reminds us of what he does best (and no one else seems to do anymore). I would recommend this CD to any music fan that appreciates straight ahead Rock on Roll, Blues, or Rockabily. There is something for everyone here."
3,"Good cook book, but nothing new or different.","This is a good cookout, but not very many or varied recipes. I was hoping that the cookbook would have some of her best recipes she does on her television program."
5,Great Cookbook,"This cookbook is awesome! Not just because it's Paula but it is the simple recipes, this is a must have for sure for anyone..."
4,Slightly better than OK,"Classics for Ms Deen aren't classics for everyone. Pick and choose, but expect to adjust the recipes to your own tastes."
4,cookbook,The cookbook is just like I thought it would be--Great. I love Paula and her southern recipes.
5,A Paula Deen must-have,"For fans of Paula Deen, this book is essential! The recipes are concise, well written, and failsafe. It should be a staple in every southern cook's cookbook library. Her stories will grab you as much as her recipes!"
4,Two Spoons Up for This Book!!,"My family needed something new and creative for dinner. I have been watching Paula on the Food TV Network and have enjoyed her true southern cooking and hospitality. In this book she shares personal stories and the meaning behind several of her ideas and recipes. It's nice to know how the idea was created. I ordered this book because it stated it was a combo. of the other 2 books. With limited space, I like the idea of less books. My family has truly enjoyed ALL of the recipes served so far. The Mac & Cheese is the BEST I have ever eatten in my life. Several of my son's friends have eatten at my house and ask when they can come back. What a variety of recipes in this book. Simple instructions and common household products. You don't have to go out and spend a small fortune for one dish. This is a Must Buy. Two spoons up!!"
2,There's no pictures!!,I was very disappointed that there were no pictures to go along with the recipes although the recipes are very good.
2,I purchased a NEW book,"I purchased a new book so I expected it to look NEW. The jacket cover was folded in half, creased, and the edges of the pages were scuffed and soiled.It was not real bad and if the book had not been purchased for a gift it would have been fine. I emailed Amazon about this but never received any reply. I am sure that I will buy again from Amazon but I won't be purchasing any more books for gifts."
3,"Good, but not great","I made a few items from the book and everything has been easy to make and came out good. However, I was a bit disappointed because I thought I would've used the book more for recipe ideas."
1,Terrible recipes,"What a disappointing cookbook! Canned soup is often used instead of homemade sauce. Bisquick based breads & rolls. The absolutely worst recipe for collard greens (one of the tastiest dishes on earth if made right). Pattypan Summer Squash is cooked into a casserole mush. I thought surely the Southern Fried Chicken would be authentic and delicious, but sadly the only bit of seasoning in the entire recipe is a small bit of pepper. Really? Skip this book."
2,too many shared recipes,"Love Paula's recipes; however, this is a two book deal and they share many of the same recipes. Should be a complete second set of dishes."
3,Paula Deen,"I liked this book, but all of the meals are for loads of people! I had to cut everything down from like 18 people to 2! this made some of the recipes not turn out well. Also, as i live in england, some of the ingredients were really expensive. This is probably due to that fact though, i guess if i live in america i would have had to buy imported foods!"
5,Blues Master,I heard some of this on the radio and was so pleased to learn that I could order it on Amazon.
4,Son is the man,"For all those pursuing deep blues this is essential listening. Sound quality is excellent. Guitar playing is rough and ready by modern technical standards, but hey - that's the way it is - all feel. Vocals are stunning. Great to hear his homage to Patton's 'Moon going down' -'Empire State Express'. This is your chance to hear real deep delta blues sans the crappy dynamics of 78RPM recordings. If only more of the old Delta players had survived long enough to be able to be re-recorded with such quality."
4,golden oldie,This is one of the original roots of R&B and Rock'n'Roll. So far its importance in the development of popular music post 1965 has only been recognised by the modern- 1970's giants -Eric Clapton - Keith Richards - Jimi Hendrix to name a few.
4,Old school blues,I needed a Son House for my blues collection because he has his own style. I love his guitar playing. Old time blues at it's best.
3,"Good, melancholy blues","This is a great album, but hard to listen to too often. Maybe I'm not a real blues fan. Son House's mournful, direct songs and instrumentation are great studies of the ups and downs of life, but I find I have to turn back to other music to get motivated again.I got into this via Jack White's frequent praise of Son House's music (and man, does White re-purpose a lot of it), but I kind of prefer modern revamps of that smoky scratchy bluuuues sound."
2,plagiarism?,"I just listened to this CD. If you listen carefully, you'll notice that this dude stole a lot of riffs from old Led Zeppelin records."
4,Good Purchase,"never having heard Son House before I had no expectation. I enjoy it a lot. I'm glad I purchased it. If you enjoy original Mississippi blues, you should like it."
5,Amazing,"This is as good as it gets, performance, playing, content, it's all here. Bone-chilling slide, and vocals that'll stand the hair up on the back of your neck. Add songs like ""Death Letter Blues"", ""Preachin' Blues"", and ""Grinning In Your Face"", and you get the musical equivalent of time travel. For people new to blues, stop here first before going on to Robert Johnson. He learned a lot from Son House."
1,"Poorly written & full of errors, typographical and otherwise","This author holds herself out as an expert but lacks objectivity, which leads me to question the accuracy of her research. The book uses numerous footnotes which are distracting and sometimes poorly tied to the text intended. In some cases, there is no tie in at all. Some of the research reminds me of what you might see in a news tabloid, possibly okay for a newspaper article, but not acceptable for what is supposed to be a serious reference book. Seriously, although this book is the first that I'm aware of on the subject, it wouldn't have a chance getting published by an investment publishing house in it's present form. It seems to me that since the author had to pay to get this book printed, (it's self published) she would have paid a qualified editor to help her write and put it together. On a positive note, kudos to the printer and graphic designer. The cover is attractive and the hardcover printing is well crafted."
5,"Good information for insureds, investors, & REGULATORS",Please get the word out to investors that these type of investments are VERY risky. Although there are probably legitimate viatial companies and viatical brokers out there - I have yet to find any. This book is very informative and explains an industry that not too many people know about.
2,Chunks are too big for my terriers to enjoy!,"My dogs did eat this variety of ProPac - but definitely prefer the smaller chunks/kibble size! Would be fine for medium to large dogs, I think."
3,Too thin,"I like the pattern, but I feel the pad is a little thin. The bumper pad is all in one piece making it impossible to lower the front of the crib. The set I had for my daughter came in two pieces, the front part was seperate making it easy to lower the front of the bed."
5,Love It!,"I love the bumper! It seems a little taller than one's I have seen in the stores, giving more coverage to the crib sides. The simple patterns with rich color will make for great focal points for the baby!"
4,If you need pointers for Single Player,"The Strategy Guide helps you out on the Campagin. Nothing more, but what you learn there you may bring over to Multiplayer or battles later on after the campagin, note that there are many patches created after this book."
3,Autopsy,"Really enjoyed Jenette Goldstein's campy performance. Some great lines, lots of gore, twisted humor. Too bad the young performers played it straight."
3,The Doctor is in!,"From the producers of the Final Destination movies comes Autopsy that was released to theaters as part of the 8 Films to Die For during the After Dark Horrorfest III. A group of friends hit a man with their car while they are on their way back from Mardi Gras. An ambulance soon arrives taking the victim and the group to a strange hospital. To find out, Dr. Benway (played by Robert Patrick) is experimenting with humans at the hospital in an attempt to save his dying wife.The movie starts out a little slow with average acting for a horror movie. The movie is a splatter-fest with blood and gore around every corner. The doctor isn't afraid to split your stomach open or drill into your skull. I give the director credit for not using CGI special effects. The movie isn't perfect, but it is better than the majority of other torture porn that is out on DVD."
1,SUCKSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS,THIS ALSO SUCK I WAS LOOKING FOR REAL AUTOPSY VIDEOS THAT SHOW THE REAL THING JUST A WAST OF MY MONEY IT ALSO WANT IN THE TRASH................
5,"5 star fun, not a re-hash","This movie was definitley watchable. It wasn't as bad as some ""wanna be critics"" say it is. Yeah, it was all done before, but this movie had scares, gore, good acting, and a very decent plot. It doesn't all have to be all brand new material, for it to be good does it? Alot of the Horrorfest movies in the past were boring and dull, but this new batch is much better. From Within and Dying Breed were also, decent flicks."
1,Rip. Render. Repeat,"College kids leave Mardi Gras. They are in a car accident. They are taken to a mysterious hospital by mysterious EMT's and staffed by mysterious people. In a farm-fresh plot twist you won't see coming most are autopsied! While alive! Wow!Other things do happen. But I admit I was only paying attention for about 40% of the time. For most of the film I was wondering what to wear to work tomorrow, where I'd left my keys and why the producers of ""Bewitched"" thought no one would notice when they recasted Darrin. Let's face it: You can only see so many rows of intestines yanked out of a person before you ask ""Yeah? And?""""Autopsy"". Well, Horrorfest had to come up with an eighth movie. Too bad this was it."
3,autopsy,"It's another hospital film, which reminds me of the film Room 6. A group of friends are in a car accident, one gets hurt more so and out of nowhere and ambulance appears and they go to this hospital with a creep staff and strange things are happening. Nothing new though never old, since i enjoy them hospital films.. like how in silent hill games, the hospital parts are the best and to be expected.. There is some good gore, like the guy patient falling on a girl and his insides come spilling out on her. The best scene is the end, where the main girl sees her guy on the operating table and... well you have to see for yourself but it's my fav. scene. I like the ending where you discover whats really going on and the charcters are cool too. It's worth renting it.."
3,"Scary, but not much else going for it.","As a horror movie, this is pretty good. It disgusted me and kind of scared me, although I was more disgusted than anything else. But I didn't care about any of the characters, and the plot was really, really thin. It was too dark to see details sometimes. But, they did a fairly good job with the dialogue. If you want to be shocked, this is a good choice, but it is not the best movie ever."
2,Ordinary and gory,"I've read the other reviews and I can't agree with everything said. To me this movie was your typical 'evil hospital, mad doctor' story. The acting was fine, but I was bored. The only thing that was unusual about this movie was how the doctor used the boyfriend as life support. It was full of gore, I'll give it that, but it was so typical. And as far as being ""campy"" or ""laughable"", ""Dr. Giggles"" was funnier."
3,"OK, 15/16"" tall","Nothing fancy or pretty (black crinkle cost finish). Taller than a typical toe stop, but not as tall as some might wish for. Perfectly usable."
5,Vintage Va Va Voom!,"I purchased the DVD by the same name and purposely waited to crack open the ""companion book"". It's a really cute coffee table conversation piece. I totally get it! It looks exactly like an old vintage photo album - chock full of stills from the movie and more, complete with side laces. It even has a groovy autograph page at the end! There is no copy in the book, other than a letter in the beginning, but that would have completely ruined the concept as there is no copy in a photo album! I love it..."
3,Usually great coffee arrives stale,"I usually buy this at our local Kroger. Unfortunately, the beast known as Wal-Mart recently killed our Kroger store off. Wal-Mart carries Folgers in whole bean form, but I refuse to ""feed the beast"". So, I took a chance and order a 6-pack box from Amazon. It took several weeks to arrive, not that it matters, because the coffee is literally within months of its expiration date and it shows in its taste and lack of aroma. Should have known better."
4,My favorite,This is my favorite Luther Vandross album! It brings back memories of my college days in the 1980's. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves listening to Luther's smooth voice!
1,Not for Novice Builders,"This is definatley not a book for novices. I bought this book for my 13 year old son for the Iron Clad models to be built for a school project. We found the ships extremely difficult to make. The book recommended model cement for plastic models to glue the ships with. We tried 3 different kinds of plastic model cement and the glue would not dry. Our chubby fingers made it impossible to work with the smaller pieces of the ships. Our MONITOR looked so awful we chucked the entire idea of using the paper models and he made his project with Legos. In the end, I felt this book was a total waste of money from the modeling aspect. However the information provided in the book on each of the 18 boats was very good. Overall was a good book to read, but the models were a flop."
3,A lot of the songs do sound similar,"I would have to agree with C-Nice below when he says that the songs sound the same. Yes, you're getting the kind of beats that you would hear with most Hip-Hop and R&B songs now, but it still sounds good. However, it depends on your tolerance level. Even though, I feel that some of the songs like ""In the morning"" and a few others have their place, they do wear thin a little too quickly. And none of the songs are memorable whatsoever. I was playing this in the car for someone I was riding with and they replied ""Is this the Mary Mary""? I said ""Yes"". And they replied, ""it sounds too much like their first CD."" The CD has a lot of energy and probably was made in an attempt ot get more radio play, but it still sounds good. I just wish they would've varied some of their songs a bit. A lot of them do sound too much like all of their other songs. I don't know whether or not to recommend this CD or not. If I had my choice again, I probably wouldn't buy it."
3,'Doesn't live up to the title,I bought this one as my sister's Christmas present (she's a big fan of the duo).I listened to it in its entirety.She's still the BIG fan.
2,Awful!!--Sophmore Slump!,Awful!!--Sophmore Slump!! thats all i have to say.....where's the hit song? if they not one hit wonders?
5,Outstanding,This is truly and outstanding CD from these two very talented sisters. This CD has something for everyone. I can easily sit and listen to every record without skipping through to the better tunes. If you are deciding if this CD is worth the money it most definitely is.
5,Gon' Mary Mary,"This cd is da bomb, it was well worth the wait. My favorite songs are ""Incredible"", ""God Bless"",""Ordinary People"", and ""Thank You"". I love this cd because that get the message of how good God is, without losing that gospel music touch. I thank God for Mary Mary and all the other gospel artists who make music their music understandable to all people. Get this cd and I promise you want be disappointed."
4,"If you liked "" Thankful"" you'll LOVE "" Incredible""","If you liked ""Thankful"" you'll LOVE "" Incredible"".This CD has the Mary Mary style,delivering a very important message. My favorite songs on the CD are "" Ordinary People"" and "" In the Morning""."
5,Definitely Uplifting and Motivating!!!,"I'm stationed in Iceland and while listening to this cd, it made me wish that I was back in the U.S. enjoying the summertime, either out at a park or a beach somewhere. I can't think of one song that I would remove from this album. The beats and their voices flow so very well together and they are not afraid to lift up Christ in their lyrics. This cd doesn't take you to the Holy of Holies, but it definitely takes your mind off of any troubling situations. Very seldom can artists top their previous work, but this album hits hard and right away. This is the best that's out there right now."
5,yes they are incredible!!!,"For those who thought Mary Mary would be a one album wonder, you're totally wrong. Mary Mary show they are the most innovative groups in Gospel Music today by blending traditional gospel, R&B and Hip-Hop. They show their flow in songs such as ""Incredible"", and ""ordinary people"". They also show their traditional roots in ""God has smiled on me"". A worthy album for any music collection."
2,I Agree,"This cd is alright and younger crowd's will buy it just for the beats, but to me this album sounds alot like their debut album thankful. I recommend Pam & Dodi and Trinitee 5:7- ""The Kiss"" over this album."
3,like there voices but the music gets too predictable,i like there voices on a few of the songs here but the music never seems to go beyond a very formula driven style&vibe for me.Mary Mary are catchy&that helps them Spread the Word but the Music overall kinda saps that Spark through a whole listen.
4,The case was cracked...,"Although the case was cracked, the CD is in good condition and I can always put it in another container. I love Mary Mary and had to get this again since my original was stolen. This is a CD worth buying twice. Thanks."
2,Did not like it.,"This book is horrible! It tries to cover such a vast subject in such a concise way, that unfortunately it ends up saying not much at all. At the end, I think it leaves you with more questions than it answers, which I also know, it's not necessarily a bad thing in education. About the questions under Cuestionario at the end of the book, the questions given are usually very specific after the subject was treated very briefly or sometimes even barely mentioned by the author, like it was the case in chapter 5, questions 2 through 9. I do not know if there is a better alternative in the market for this subject, but I certainly did not like this one too much."
2,It's have several mistakes,"Inside the Argentina's description, this book have importants mistakes about the activities in the principals cities."
3,Used.,"It was in worse shape than I expected, but it was used and a lot less than I would've had to pay for. It was for grad school."
5,Cultural Dimension of International Business. The (6th Edition),This books captures all the intricases on culture. It is a wonderful book to read before making aq business trip abroad. You would like to read it again and again!
2,Lots of information - pretty boring approach,I bought this for my MBA program and found this book having good contents but the approach is not good.... I would have done the layout much differently to make it more interesting.....I had to read this book and so read it..... not greatly impressed.
5,Profound information with personal solutions,"I was impressed with the compilation of the massive amounts of information about the environment put in a way that creates an illumination of the actual problem that exists on earth. More impressively, it gives practical solutions that each of us personally can work to do in our lives."
2,No new insight that compliments other sources,"I have read many books on this battle. One of them was a very good book called 'Battle of the Bulge' by Danny S. Parker. In addition to a high reguard for Parker, the Amazon's professional review and reader's review were both excellent. So, for me, this was a 'must buy'. I was disappointed. The book has six chapters. Each chapter is an interview experience with an important German officer with real responsibility in the battle. Some of these chapters are hardly comprehensible. One, General Kramer, is poorly translated. There is personal puffery, poor memories, and precious little real insight into the battle. Only General Brandenberger's narrative is concise and informative. The bottom line, if I had gone to Borders or another of the big book stores and had reviewed the book before buying, I would have passed."
1,Too basic and incomplete,"I just finished doing a major remodel. I'm not a contractor so I bought a few books on the subject - this being one of them. I knew I'd be working with experienced tradespeople, but I wanted to know enough to make sure they were doing things right. The information in this book was too basic and incomplete. It might be more appropriate for someone who has a contractor building their home and wants to understand the scope of their work rather than as a guide for doing it yourself."
4,Very specific information on limited areas,I used it to write specification to give to contractors so we can get bids. The specs are detailed but I still added lots of my own stuff to customize it for my needs.
1,"Obsolete, Incomplete",The first thing I looked up in this book was siding options. What can you say about a book that fails to list the single most common and cost effective option: Fiber Cement (aka hardiplank). I think this is a book inexpertly updated from the 80s. The book has NOTHING on Windows. It has a little section on finding info on the internet that pre-dates Google. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. It's a waste of time and money.
5,"Great Book, Highly Recommended","I built an addition onto my home, and what I learned from that is, it is easier than you think. A friend of mine just had extensive work done remodeling an older home that he just bought. New electric, plumbing, heating, landscaping, garage-shop addition etc. What he learned from that is the General Contractor he hired was busier making everything more expensive, rather than running the job. Now he is finishing the job himself, and doing a good job of being his own GC. This book gives you step by step instructions> great hand holding every step of the way. With checklists for each stage of the game: What to look out for, what is needed, and what works. This book can save you a bundle, and keep you on top of what is going on. Definitely worth every penny. Highly recommended."
2,The Complete Guide to Contracting Your Home,Book has many outmoded products and procedures. Needs updating.
5,A very useful book for first-timers,"I bought a number of books on construction contracting prior to having a new home built. This was one of two that I found very useful, and I would recommend it as a reference for folks building a home, especially if you've never done it before. The book includes basic construction techniques and terminology that I found helpful in communicating with my builder; a rough timetable for steps in the construction process; and a wealth of sample documents that helped me think about how to manage my paperwork, especially the change order process. Glad I bought it!"
1,save your money,"as professional contractor, I can tell you that if you're looking for a book to provide the latest building techniques using the latest materials, look elsewhere. It does provide management info, but in a word:lame."
4,"""Real Artists"" can't catch a break!!","This cd is tight, musical poltics really sucks. There're alot of R&B groups that can't touch this cd at all, not because i know one of the members personally (shout out to Tony ""T-Bone"" Hightower) but it's that good. Real music has become a thing of the pass :("
4,Lively biography,"Joe Meek. Definitely a colorful character of the 19th century fur trade era. Whenever reading books about the early American West, one always comes across the name Joe Meek. He came out west in 1829 at the age of nineteen desperately wanting to be a mountain man/fur trapper. Adventures were many up to the last rendevous of 1840 with the typical Indian fighting, grizzlies, starvation and thirst, etc. He then helped guide the first wagon train to Oregon and had much to do with the first government of Oregon. This is a delightful story of a charming individual. He loved life and people loved Joe, just beware of the oftentimes ""backwoodsy"" grammar in the book (I could have done without that)."
4,Dion and The Belmonts - Greatest Hits,"I bought the cd for a friend's 60th birthday. He really likes it, he put it in his van's cd player right away. I just hope he doesn't mind me singing along with Dion and the Belmonts. It is fun and light-hearted!"
4,Almost 5 stars,"All the great hits are here, though a few lesser known songs fill up the CD with extraneous material. My own personal favorite, ""When You Wish upon a Star"" sounds great, and the original ""Diane"", with kazoo solo, was perfect."
5,The best group out of the 50's and 60's,They are the best group in the world and let me tell you that this is a good CD if you are a truly Dion fan like i am.
4,Classics,These songs will bring back nostalgic memories of some good times when the world/living was a less complicated.
4,Some extra info about it - - what I do have,"Mine is just one book - Volume eight ""Bombers and reconnaissance aircraft""Third edition, October 1969Made and printed in Great Britain(c) William Green, 1967Dimensions 5.5"" x 5""160 pagesb/w photos and contours, tecnical details about planes"
1,Buy a better sandwich instead of this book,"I notice that no reviewer has claimed to have ever traded the ""system"", made a dime from it, or even invested a dime and lost it. Just as well.The problem is that if you need a book to tell you about finance.yahoo.com, it's very unlikely you'll find day trading easy--at least this year. It's like saying that getting into the olympics is easy: just go down to the swimming pool and practice, then win the us championships and you are on your way to an olympic gold medal. If you could win a gold following those instructions, you can make your million waiting for your lunch to be served. It'll be easy."
4,Excellent survey book on Ontology,"The book is well organized in introducing the subject in a coherent manner and weaving in all important criteria of ontology together. I especially like to read the comparison of different languagees in light of knowlege represenation and knowlege reasoing. The book is great in terms of getting a broad view (survey) and is also great as a reference. In many pages, there is so much information packed in each sentences. Great book."
1,"Complicated, Boring, and Irrelevant","The subject matter is much too complex, does not follow a logical order, is a slow and arduous read, and is not practical.This book was the subject of a book club where I and a small group of software engineers wanted to learn more about ontologies. Most of the members of the group had some experience with ontology languages. In each one-hour lunch session, we were not able to discuss more than 10 pages at a time due to the complexity of the writing and the subject matter. We finally gave up and none of us has finished the book. Although we read over half of the book before giving up, we gained no practical knowledge from it whatsoever."
2,"enjoyable, but nothing special...","I got this CD at a discount, so i don't feel that cheated, but it's not a cd to buy at full price...the songs are catchy, but only as background music. I love ska, but breakthrough ska is always more appealing, and this is quite mundane. the only songs I truly like are ""human pinata"" and ""walkin' frustration."" And who wants a CD that there are only two truly good songs on? If you get it at a discount, more power to you. If not, pass it by."
3,What are we doing wrong?,"I ordered these to go with the Aquadoodle mat that my 2 1/2 year old already had. I'm not sure if it is just the nature of the mat or if we are adding too much water to the stamp pad, but the stamped images do not come out very clear. My son still enjoys playing with the stamps."
4,Comfy sock,"I needed some new socks for work and got about four pairs of these (2 black 2 blue). My boyfriend liked them as well and took the 2 blue. Both of us agree that the sock was comfortable to wear (I wore them to work, he wears them on a night out) they keep feet cool and dry and your feet didnt feel like they were squashed into the shoe. The only ""issue"" we have with them is that they come very high up the leg - right up under the knee and the elastic is a bit tight there so a bit uncomfortable in that region after a while."
5,Cecilia - Amazing Grace,I heard Cecilia's version of Amazing Grace after the World Trade Center tradgey. Our local radio station DJ played it on air and since that time it has been requested regularly during the day.It is the most moving rendition of Amazing Grace I have ever heard. I have purchased several copies of her CD just to give to friends and family. I do not normally recommend music but this is a must have album for anyone.
5,Soul-wrenchingly exquisite,"A beautiful voice with a beautiful message. It's impossible to listen to Cecilia's incredible voice and the words of the songs contained on this CD without touching the very heart of your soul. A must, not only for the feminine spirit, but for the caring part of all of us."
4,Simply exquisite voice!,"Hearing this lady sing Amazing Grace made me want this CD, but all the music is beautiful. My only complaint is that there isn't more! Please find more of her recordings, Amazon!"
3,Great voice...but lacking music.,"i am not a fan of New Age music, but she has an amazing voice.however, i say if you want MUSIC buy something by Evanescence.there is no real music here, whatever her voice sounds like."
4,Beautiful sounds,An unusual album with sounds that will transport you. I bought this CD primarily for Cecilia's version of Amazing Grace. It hits every fiber of your being and has to be one of the most beautiful renditions I've ever heard. Wayne Dyer can take the credit for raising awareness about Cecilia as he mentions her on one of his audio CDs.Other tracks include wolf howls and whale calls along with her own inimitable style of songs.
5,Angelic Heights,"owling winds and animal cries appear from soundscapes of voices in this sophisticated and tribal feast of musical dreams. At times the music creates desolate landscapes and at other times you feel like you are in dense forests or angelic heavenly vistas.Suddenly as if out of nowhere, we move from primal cries to a contrasting spiritual moment of Amazing Grace.Tracks:Solveig's Song; 1st verseThe Sacred HumLove of a Silent MoonTwo Swans Matched in FlightDaughter of the Midnight SunAmazing GraceSilver WingsThe Lion and the UnicornThe Eternal HeartbeatUnite the TribeSoveig's Song; 2nd verseCecilia Bartoli has such a clarity in her voice and she soars in every track. She reaches such angelic heights it is stunning. Every song is a masterpiece.The songs end in an ancient dream, with echoes acrossempty landscapes where Cecilia's voice is the musical textureof the world.~The Rebecca Review"
5,Best canned clams I've ever used,"My local grocery store has stopped stocking Crown Prince canned clams and I'm forced to buy them online instead. I've opened cans side by side with Snow's and have been shocked that the Crown Prince cans contain more than twice as much clam meat, drained, than Snow's. In addition, the Crown Prince clams are pink and look cleaner than Snow's. I actually opened, drained and weighed a number of cans of each variety so I'm sure it wasn't a fluke."
2,Are these really clams?,"Linguini with clams is a staple in our home. These clams appeared to be a great deal...they indeed are cheap, but a significant tradeoff for quality. We're going back to snows. I purchased this 12 pack case here on Amazon and am donating the remainder to a canned food drive. I give it two stars, which is generous, rather than one because of the price and it resembles clams.Pro's:CheapCon's:Texture - there are not really full pieces of clams in here...it was a mealy mix of ""ground"" clam. It appears to be what's left after every other processor takes what they want from the clam.Flavor - It faintly resembles clams but I couldn't bring myself to finish the dish. We even mixed this can with a can of Snows but that was still not very good. There is a very ""processed"" flavor to these clams.Net net...you get what you pay for."
1,worst clams ever,"The liquid smells of chemicals and the clams taste the same. I doubt these are safe to eat. Either the clams themselves, or the waters they are packed in, are coming from some polluted source. Since Amazon won't take responsibility to refund on these, I am throwing them into the municipal waste."
3,Good clams...,"These chopped clams are good- not great, but good. I add them to canned clam chowder to boost the protein content, and they are quite adequate for that. They aren't quite as sweet as my previous brand- but pricing was good, and because I'm disabled, the delivery to my door is also a perk. I'll use them, but will probably go back to the ""clammier"" brand I was buying."
1,Minced not chopped,"I should have believed an earlier review about these being advertised as chopped, they are more like minced, very disappointing, returning to chicken of the sea chopped"
5,"Once I started, I couldn't put it aside.",I'm sure it took a lot of research to make the book both exciting and readable by someone as unscientific as I. I'd recommend this book to everyone.
5,An exciting and eye-opening read,"I hearyily recommend this book for every adult, every youth over the age of 12 and anyone interested in our pioneering efforts in space. Cammick has given you and me a space-eye view of Amierica today and in the not to distant future. Kudos also to Bob Cassell who designed the cover."
4,Old school British blues,"Bought this cheap as a download. Always been a Stone the Crows fan, thought it was about time I added them to my iTunes library. Maggie Bell is in fine form here."
5,Join the Circus,"""Frontier Circus"" was a western that aired on CBS in the 1961 season. A circus traveling through the untamed west. An interesting concept."
3,"good show, poor box.","I like the show, it is good and has good actors guest starring. I have noticed that many of the episodes center around a guest star and not the regulars on the show. The stories are a little predictable, but at least not childish. In fact some are very mature and deal with social issues, like child abandonment and alcoholism. The 3 stars is for the horrible box the DVD s come in. Terrible package. I have bought several TV shows from this company and all ahve this same problem. While I am happy these shows are on DVD, I would think they could at least try to put them in a box that you can get them out of without nearly tearing thte flimsy thing."
1,Nobody does it worse.,"This album joins an elite group of 00's releases that haven't a shred of real emotion or innovation but are mistaken to have both. Along with ""I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning,"" this is quite simply the worst music has to offer. In every possible prefabricated way."
3,bela lugosi is not dead,"Main singles ""tear you apart"" and ""out of control"" are definitely catchy but the whole album has that dejavu feeling that can be rather annoying...they?re not ripping-off joy division or bauhaus here they?re ripping off interpol that did in my opinion a better interpretation of the 80?s...it?s certainly fun but don?t take it seriously."
2,gothic chipmonks do be lurking in the night,"1st things 1st. This has the emotional appeal of a paperweight sitting on my desk .. none at all. Contrived, but maybe he'll kill himself lik Ian did, it would be the end of a oh so tragic 15 minutes of faim.But let's move on people. The grunge sceen has been repeting itself with Pearljamisc repetity, so why not goth? At least it's not another winy band sounding like Default, or .. fill in the blank. So in that light it's listenable.Some bands do a good job of covering a style. Let's look at The Merry Thoughts. They sounded a hell of a lot like the Sisters, but were able to inject their own style to give it originality.Maybe, in a few years, She wants revenge will find the dark soul they are striving for. I find this to be a comforting and darkly posative outlook on which to end this review."
1,Please...,"Come on, people. Spend your money and time on the Best Of Joy Division, Bauhaus -or- Sisters Of Mercy instead of this recycled/redundant nonsense that's basically a way for the band to pick up chicks: ""We just wanted to make a record that would make girls dance and cry."" Someone wrote on here that SWR is, essentially, better than Depeche Mode and Joy Division... unbelievable."
2,Not trying to bash the cd...,"I didn't really know how to rate this, I'm not trying to bash it. To be honest I haven't had much interest in listening to the entire disc. I really like ""Tear You Apart"", so I thought I'd check out the album. I actually wanted to find the remix of ""Tear You8 Apart"" by DJ Icey. I like that remix much better, but I don't think it is for sale anywhere right now. I highly recommend you check out the remix though. It played on Sirius ""Boombox Ch. 34"" for much of July."
1,And people thought Interpol was ripping off Joy Division,"Wow. I've never heard such a blatent rip off of a band before. For all of you who've never heard the album ""Closer,"" but love this album, you're in for a bit of a surprise. EVERYTHING, and I'm not exaggerating, is taken directly from Ian Curtis and his band Joy Division. From the pointy sounding bass to the monotone-deep-nervous voice, to the abrasive and non-melodic guitar parts...it's like someone reinvented sliced bread under a different name and everyone rushed out to buy it again.You've all been duped.""Closer"" is light years better than this stuff. Do yourself a favor and buy that album instead."
2,"Ridiculous, mostly pathetic zombie dance idiocy.","Hey, that's a pretty good title! If there's any life to this drivel, it's in the drum machine. Monotous, goofy, apparently serious (thus making it ridiculous) undead haircut robot music. Intense deadpan ruminations on dancing, sex and breaking up with girls over a.m. radio Depeche Mode beats and Joy Division guitar. Stupid, really. Save your intense deadpan ruminations for things like nuclear holocaust, the exploitation of children, and the Rape of Nanking."
5,Not love at first listen...,"but this album has grown on me like a bad fever. At first I was like ""oookaaaaay Interpol wannabes,"" but after a handful of listens, I really love this album and am becoming addicted, in the same way that I become addicted to Interpol. There is only one or two tracks on her that I am not that into, but overall its a great album and it is more electronic than interpol. This is a great combination for those of us who tend to lean towards 80s dark-wave and goth. I certainly wouldn't call it post-punk though. I will say though, that if I was Interpol, I would be a little sketchy of these guys."
4,I like this album,I like this album. It is very different from what I normally listen to.This band kind of reminds me of Cake.
2,What on Earth?,"The music was awesome, but the vocals were just plain awful. Like an 80s wannabe vocal style with bad reverb effect thrown in. Hard to believe that Depeche Mode and Placebo had these guys open for them, I love both of them, but the vocals on this album were painfully bland. Unfortunately, I don't know if its editing or what, but the way the vocals are laid over the music it can't be disguised. I mean, music like that should make the vocals fairly irrelevant, but the music is kept at a level that puts the vocals on display. . .and because the vocals aren't WOW it comes off as cheesy at best."
2,SHE WANTS SOMETHING NEW....,"I LOVE ""TEAR YOU APPART"", BUT I DIDN'T FOUND ANOTHER GREAT SON IN THIS ALBUM, IF YOU ARE UNDECIDED, BUY THE SONG YOU LIKE."
3,Killing the Meme,"The ""ripping off Interpol/Joy Division"" meme must die. If you are too cool to like this band, then you are one insecure loser. This album won't go down in history, but it has two songs that completely rip (""Don't Wanna Fall in Love"" & ""Tear You Apart""). The rest is mostly filler, but together the hits are worth $8.99.Joy Division only ever had like 3 good songs anyway..."
3,Tongue in electronic cheek...,"I think a lot of people have missed the point here. There is a song about popsickles and [...], for Christ's sake!Is this a good band? That's debatable, but they ape the late '80s electronica pretty competently. If anything, they tend to show why so many late '80s electronica bands couldn't make it while artistes like New Order could.It's for fun, and it's not bad imitation as flattery. But don't think it's even near as good as semi-serious post new wave bands like Interpol, Killers, Rockethouse, A Place to Bury Strangers, Bravery, etc.It is what it is. And that's just decent, with a sense of humor."
2,"Decent music, laughable lyrics","My friend suggested I give them a listen being a Joy Division and Bauhaus fan and a fan of some things 80's gloom/goth rock, so I did. And while musically they are quite good, and better than I expected (but still far too derivative), their lyrics were so inane they border on parody (a lot of goth music is like this, and I can easily put with with the lyrical excesses of bands like Sisters of Mercy, etc., but this has taken it to a new level). Oh, so girls are mean to you, you poor thing, why do you have to pen incessantly cliched lyrics whining about such, and ruining what would be a decent song with your ridiculous moaning. Perhaps if I were a 13 year old girl I would find this entertaining."
1,she wants revange,i am looking to return this item.the box was damaged (cracked).there was 66 tracks on cd.the first 12 were playing and the last 66 showed as a hidden track.is this not an orginal cd or what?
5,track # 66,I Like It ! But what's about track # 66 ( after last song #12 and 5 minutes pause my CD play to me track # 66 ( 7:47 ) - what it is ?
1,Losers In Black...,"If the comics on Saturday Night Live ever wanted tospoof the current line of mascara-painted '80srevivalists such as the Killers and Bravery, it'sunlikely their efforts would be nearly as successfulas She Wants Revenge. It's not that the Los Angelesduo made up of party DJ Adam Bravin and former De LaSoul copycat Justin Warfield means for its self-titleddebut to be funny. But the group's one-note impressionof dark new wave acts like Joy Division, The Cure andBauhaus is just so blatant--from the ominousbass-lines and fawning band name (Peter Hook's NewOrder side project was called Revenge) to song titlessuch as ""Tear You Apart"" (Ian Curtis fans would beright to notice the similarities to their beloved""Love Will Tear Us Apart"") and Goth 101 lyrics (""Takeyour hand, and smack me in the mouth, my love"") --it's hard not to laugh. --Aidin Vaziri"
2,ah 2.5 i guess,"ok, i really WANT to like this band. i try and listen to it over and over again and convince myself that i like it, but i don't. it is good, i mean i couldn't come up with this stuff and they do sound as good as joy division and ""JD rip-offs for emo so-cal and NYC (no-means-no eyeliner boys xHxCx) kids"" interpol on 2 songs, and that's GREAT cause I love those bands! but for some reason i can't dig it ... so yeah. garlic breath at the bar for this CD."
4,better than you'd think.,"Yes, this has all been done before. But that doesn't matter, because it was great the first time around and these guys pick the best parts and stitch them all together in relatively new ways. Plus the songs are just fun to dance to, and sometimes that is all you really need."
2,Goth beginner?,"If you are a teenage male or female ""Goth in Training"" this is the cd for you. However if you are older and listened to bands like Bauhaus or Joy Division or Depeche Mode when you were a teenager don't waste your money on this cd. The music itself is good, but the lyrics are bad and most of the time just painful to hear. Every song made me hope the next would be better. If these guys can get it together, spend more time on better lyrics and less time on the ""image"" maybe the next cd will be something I can listen to without rolling my eyes."
3,3.5 stars. Forget the Similarites.,"Putting aside all the obvious similarities to any band, this album is actually not bad. She Wants Revenge said on their website that they wanted to make a release that would make people dance and girls cry (or something to that effect). I'm not so sure about the girls crying part, but the dance-ability is definitely there. Almost all of the songs on this release are extremely catchy, and they really do make you want to move. It's easy to see why some people are angry that She Wants Revenge is a ""rip-off"" band, but it's also easy to see why so many people like them.Decide for yourself.NOTE: If you buy the actual hard album (not a digital version), there is a hidden track. Ironically enough, the song is probably the best on the album."
2,Who is this?,"Is it Bahaus?....is it Sisters of Mercy?...is it Joy Division?...is it New Order?....is it Interpol?...NO!!!There is more than just an ""influence"" of the listed bands in this album. There is, in my opinion, blatant thievery. I don't know what makes a music downloader any more of a thief than this band!!! Even some of the lyrics (themes) are copied!!If you want to hear this band....just put on one of these other bands' records. It's the same thing only original and with talent."
1,yet another successful cloning,"Everything is recyclable nowadays, including music. To call these guys bad would be an insult to the bands that they ripped off. You'd have to be a 14 year old emo/goth wannabe to think that there is anything original about them. Im not going to recycle the names of the bands that they ripped off, it's all been said in previous reviews.Just about every song on this cd sounds like something previously recorded by a 20 year old band. What I will say is that they remind me of an american idol scouted, wannabe goth boy band; kinda like the backstreet boys on heavy doses of xanax.Too bad they'll never make waves on they're own, they have to play in the wake of the real bands that left their mark over 20 years ago."
1,tired and ridiculous,"I just don't know how anyone could take this cd seriously. But then here I am reviewing it, too.Its because I find it so repellant, and I hope to save somone, at least, from wasting their money, and missing out on the much better musicthat are it's influences, mentioned many times already here.This is simply one of the most contrived, pretentious soulless andirritating cds I have ever heard.The guy cannot sing, and its not cool , or sexy.If somone thinks it is, thats kind of sad.It just sounds like a desperate stab at fame.I am even embarassed for them a bit, but not too much, because I'msure they are thrilled with their success.Dont waste your money!! There is so much actually GOOD music out thereto listen to !"
1,Not the worst thing I have ever heard..,"All and all the entire album is pretty much a Bauhaus rip-off. The lead singer does his best to sound like Peter Murphy which actually attacted me to the CD but upon hearing it I was dissapointed. The whole album tosses out horrible cliche lyrics that even the youngest of goth kiddies will get bored with quickly. The one song on the album ""Tear you Apart"" which is constantly played on the radio is sadly the best thing on the album. If you're thinking of getting this, just get the 4 song EP instead, there's actually a couple decent songs on it and it costs less."
1,LOOKS LIKE A BURNED CD!!!,I would not buy from this vendor AGAIN!!! The product came but it had 66 tracks! Many of the songs were mislabeled and missing. I tried contacting them to see if they would refund a portion of the money and no response. BAD customer service. If I would have seen a comment about them like this I would have just downloaded the copy from amazon! Don't buy them!
2,good bassist............not so good musoc,"I have never heard the ablum, but i saw them live when they came to chicago with one of the best bands ever (british or otherwise) placebo. All there songs sounded the same aside from one dance song they played. everything seemed to just run together. it was so bad that when the tour first started placebo was playing first and then them but half the crowd would leave so they had to change the order. one thing i must say is that live they have a good bassist and he he has a nice style and look"
1,"i dont usually do ""sounds like"" reveiws, but","rip off of interpol. interpol was ripping off enough (and doing a fine job) as it was, but this is just awful. i cant believe this is getting more radio play than interpol. awful."
4,"Not bad, but a bit contrived","It's a bit of a catchy sounding album but the vocals are a bit too contrived. It seems like they are trying too hard to sound like Interpol, Bauhaus or Joy Division. It's ok to be influenced by other bands but you should have a unique sound too.That said, I do listen to this album and I kind of like it."
4,Hate is sometimes pretentious,"Someone once said to me that the lead singer of She Wants Revenge is trying too hard to sound like the lead singer of Interpol. To which I replied, isn't the lead singer of Interpol just trying to sound like the lead singer of Joy Division? One of the origional post-punk groups? Who cares if a group sounds like some classic band who did it better?...as long as said band does it pretty well too? And She Wants Revenge does it pretty well. Their music is interesting and so are their lyrics. And who cares if if it gives a nod to Section 25 or Joy Division or Depeche Mode or whoever? The songs COULD be a little more varied but the fact they aren't doesn't diminish their entertainment quality much. Just enjoy it and stop trying to be cool or hip by name-dropping classic groups that She Wants Revenge may sound a little like."
4,At least some new lyrics to learn...,"Such harsh reviews for a good, not great, but good cd. Give it a chance. My point being... I already know all of the lyrics to Joy Division, New Order, and (of course) Depeche Mode. At least it is something new to spin.Someone quoted ""We just wanted to make a record that would make girls dance and cry."" and, it turn, bed some band chicks. Duh! What band isn't?"
4,Sounds like bands I like? Great!,"I'm always surprised when people say things like,""They sound just like my favorite band XYZ! Rip-offs! Burn it!""We're living in a world where art is waning and people are desperate for it, and yet everything is required to be absolutely original. Ha! To be a good band, I don't think that you have to be wholly new. And how could you?!Try to think of it more like this: if a band is coming out with music that sounds a lot like so many of your favorite bands... maybe see it as you're getting to listen to more music that fits your favorite genre and enjoy it."
3,Get over it,"Yeah they were obviously influenced by Joy Division, Bauhaus, Sisters of Mercy etc but speaking as a total music snob I didn't dislike the album at all. Pretty much every band out now essentially ripped off Gang of Four. Does that make them suck? Absolutely not. I think if Ian Curtis were still around for New Order they'd sound something like SWR with better lyrics. By the way if you like Joy Division listen to the band Ian was in before JD,Warsaw."
4,"Derivative, but cool","Yes, there are vaild comparisons with early/mid Depeche Mode, Joy Division and Bauhaus and to a lesser extent The Cure, but this a really enjoyable album, taken on it's own. If you're open to this kind of music, give it a few listens and you'll be completely hooked. Besides, Joy Divison and Bauhaus broke up a long time ago (revival tours excluded) and any new music that brings this kind of electronic/dance music back in the the mainstream has to be welcomed with open arms."
5,These guys are gonna be big!,"Imagine the singer and guitar player from the band Interpol playing with the guys in Depeche Mode....THAT is what She Wants Revenge sounds like. If you like either one of those bands, then you're sure to like this band too. It's actually only two guys in the band, but what a great sound they have!"
5,!!,"i've been eagerly awaiting this release since september. what a fantastic album; it blows away every single one of its counterparts, especially if your 80s taste runs along the lines of joy division, sisters, bauhaus, and new order. just fantastic."
2,"Generic, mediocre","When listening to music or looking at art, I sometimes ask myself: ""Would it make the least bit of difference to the world if this had never been created? "" In the case of this record the answer, inescapably, is ""no."" These unremarkable songs are just generic brit-pop clubbish music. You'll hear it in bars in the East Village of NYC... people think they're being cool by picking it off the jukebox. With its ""scantily clad model holding a knife"" cover photo it wants to be edgy and cool... but it's just a yawn."
2,A remarkably mediocre album,"This album isn't nearly as bad as some of the reviewers have said on here yet it's not nearly as good as some others have also said. How could anyone even compare this to interpol? thats a HUGE insult to what is currently one of the most influential bands in the world. on the other hand, they do have some catchy stuff that might appeal to fans of joy division and depeche mode. unfortunately, the high school lyrics tend to negate most of the manufactured meaning of this record, so I couldn't really get into it. my advice...listen to it before you buy it."
1,can't get over it,"Just listen to the bands SWR got their music from. If Ian were alive they won't sound like SWR it would be the other way around, but he is not. Warsaw is Joy Division they just changed their name. If you like SWR it is to your likings. Just save your money."
3,"Too Many Characters, Too Much of the ""F"" word","This book sounded promising, but after about 20 pages and the upteenth instance of variations on the ""F"" word, I gave up. I couldn't keep the characters straight, and I don't think it's just me. If you read the book description on amazon or the inside cover description in the book, Emmy's daughter is listed as ""Lila,"" whereas Lila is really her friends' daughter. Emmy's daughter is named Maia. If even the blurb writer can't keep them straight, how can the average reader?"
4,Engaging British Read,"This is a lovely book that tells the story of several families living communaly in Cornwall, England. The adults and children's stories take turns from chapter to chapter, yet you feel as if you are getting to know each character very well. This book will not change your life, but it will allow you to escape into their world for awhile. I also enjoyed the ""British-isms"""
3,closer to the pain,"I would not be surprised if this album had a title ""Black Vanity, part II"" since it has a sound similar to the first album's , though they are still different. ""Elysia"" is a good song, catchy, mensurable and emotional, but ""Closer to the pain"" is tuneless. I had never heard before that Mathias Lodmalm can only sing ""hey, hey, it's a last transmission, yeah"" the whole song, third is also monotonous, the same as ""Primal"" where lyrics contain only one word. And also it is usually there that one riff repeats itself a hundred times during one song. Of course, album has positive moments as well, and ""Sundown"" is the best song of all day long. ""Ophidian"" and ""The embrace"" are great , too, deep and emotional. I gave this album three stars because it has plenty of weak songs and I still prefer two previous albums ""Black Vanity"" and ""Godless Beauty"" a lot more."
3,worthwhile Euro-metal,"Like many Swedish bands of the 90s, Cemetary started out death then got more melodic and gothic. By the time of this album, they were full-on into gothic mode. These simple metal grooves are powered by choppy power chords, gothic keyboards, and Maidenish leads. Apocalyptic lyrics are barked out in a semi-melodic gruff voice. Good, solid, straightforward metal, the kind that only seems to get made by European bands these days."
5,Excelente equipo al mejor precio.,El equipo llegó completo en un buen empaque. Su instalación es sumamente fácil. El CB emite un sonido de recepcion alto y claro. Excelente compra a un buen precio.
1,Not good,"Not what was expected.I have had heaps of trouble since I ordered this item - really needs more info.I do not proclaim that I am an expert on CB, but i have had problems from day one..."
2,cant hear it,This CB SUCKS spend a little extra $$ and buy a better one...everything is Garbuled....Dont buy it.....dont dont do it
2,"I love the CB, but I am very up-set that a antenna didn't come with the CB.","I got a scanner at the same time I ordered a CB. the scanner came with a antenna, but I was highly disappointed that a antenna didn't come with the CB that I ordered."
4,i am happy,"the product is good and i am very happy because the midland 1001z is good radio whit my antena i can do DX and i have comunication whit people in Puerto Rico, Costa Rica, Mexico an south USA, my locate is in Ecuator. The product is good"
3,Can I get a radio check?,"I have been unable to get a ""radio check"" since installing my new Midland, and live right off the turnpike with plenty of radio traffic. Midland suggests driving to a truck stop. I decided rather than drive my rv clear across town and spend 3 gallons or more in stop and go traffic, I bought a Midland portable to test my installed Midland... waiting on its arrival at this writing. If it doesn't work, you can bet it will be shipped right back to Midland for coverage under their warranty."
4,I like it,"This is a good, inexpensive little radio. I bought it to use in my 4x4. So far it has held up nicely and it works better than I thought it would. I have been using it with a magnet mount whip and have found it to reach out about 2 miles with ease. It even worked very well in the canyons we four wheel in. If I need to I will buy another."
4,seems to be a nice little radio,"Purchased this radio based on reviews. Received it and hooked it up to find only power. No volume, no transmit and no receive. Sent it back and Amazon sent me a new one and received it in two days. Hoooked this one up and so far it appears to work fine. Nice little basic simple radio no bells or whisles. Using it for traffic info when I travel...Very pleased with Amazons return policy.. easy and fast... no problems returning item, they provided me with all the return RA information and pre-printed address form."
3,"Works, irritating channel 9 return",This was an easy install and it works reliably in my Jeep. The only irritating feature is that it returns to channel 9 every time it loses power so if you hook it up to ignition hot leads then you have to deal with that every time you stop and start the car.
4,A good bang for the buck so far,"I've just mounted it up and tried it out for the first time. It's hard to judge thus far because I haven't received my whip antenna yet, but a functioning cb with PA cabilities for $40 is tough to beat. The construction is a little cheap, so is the mounting hardware, but it functions like it's supposed to and install is about as straight forward as it comes. It's a smaller unit too so if you want to throw it in a cramped cockpit you should be able to find a spot."
5,the best little CB,"we have two of these, one in the RV and one in the Jeep. THey have worked flawlessly for years."
4,Customer Review of Amazon Purchase,"I am satisfied with the product I purchased thru Amazon.com. The radio does look like the advertised picture, works fine and I consider it a good value for the price."
3,My radio for camping and vacations,Cheap little radio that is more for around the lake or when going on vacation- road trip.Dont buy a cheap antenna or the radio wont perform as expected.
2,You almost get what you pay for.,"Save your money, The digital display doesn't show the numers anymore, it has really bad reception, tinny sound quality and doesn't put out it's rated 4 watts...save some money and buy a better radio, this one is not good."
5,GREAT CB RADIO FOR THE PRICE,"Great product for the price, able to pick up stuff from miles away. You cant beat this cb radio. AWESOME!"
5,This is a great buy for the price!,This is a great buy for the price! I hooked it up to my suburban with a pa speaker and it works great. The only thing is the wire it came with was not long enough to reach the battery so i spliced it. Other than that its good!
4,Works great,Can't beat the performance for the price - Don't let the price fool you. - I've paid a lot more for radios that don't do as well as this product.
4,Nice inexpensive cb,"I bought this cb for my husband to use for hunting with his father. It works great and he loves it. A good basic cb, paired with a decent antenna it should work nicely for you."
4,Good CB for the money,"I bought this CB for my boyfriend, who's an OTR truck Driver. This little CB has made his life a little easier.I read the reviews before purchasing and it had a better rating for the money. Good job Midland!!"
1,You Get What You Pay For...,"The Midland 1001Z is an overall decent radio at first glance. The compact size and easy installation was a plus. I thought that you couldn't go wrong with that price, and maybe that is still true. It worked great for a month. Then one week after the Amazon return window closed, it stopped working. Completely dead. Every other piece of electronics in my vehicle was functioning fine. My recommendation, save your money up and buy a better radio. Sure, you can always send it in under the three year warranty, but after the shipping and handling costs, you might as well have just bought a new radio."
1,installed 3,"I have installed 3 of these radios, two have malfunctioned one is still working after a month. Spend a little more and buy a Uniden."
1,Does not work properly,"Spent about 25 mins installing, when all was done the radio did not work properly. Stuck on channel 9 even after you hit the emergency channel 9 button. Should of forked out the extra couple bucks for a better one :/"
1,Sorry soldering,Had this for about 3 weeks. Had to put slight pressure on the mic connection in order for volume to work. Opened up the unit and found some cold solder joints. Do not recommend this product unless you can solder.
1,Poor quality control,Purchased a Midland because I thought it would be of good quality. Upon receipt I found it had severe audio feed back in transmit mode with squeal. Spent several weeks with Midland Customer Service and still not satisfied. They agreed to send me another one but I still don't have it after several weeks. Very poor customer service. I would not buy another Midland product.
4,good radio for the money,"i bought this radio about a week ago and ive used it a few times. when i first got it hooked up i called for a radio check and got a guy about 4 miles away and it sounded fairly clear. i asked how i sounded and the driver said it sounded like a high dollar radio. i paired this with a k40 superflex 4' whip and it works great. the rf gain is really nice to see on such a cheap radio. i only gave it 4 stars because the mic seems kinda cheep and flimsy and the cord is only about 3' streched out. but for only $35, i cant complain. i would definatly buy this radio again."
2,Cheap and has low audio!!!,"I purchased this radio so i have something for ch 19 on the way home from a trip out of state. The radios transmit audio was low....VERY LOW, so i purchased an amplified mic from a truck stop. Still way too low, so i went on the internet and looked up mods for this radio and ended up peaking out the audio and cutting the limiter. It didnt do a darn thing!!! The audio sounds like 30% modulation, and the receive picks up alot of static and splatter.Ive been a CBer since the 1970's and a Ham Radio operator since the 1980s, and ive been an Extra Class Ham for over 20 years. Ive owned many radios, and this radio is seriously low on the audio section.There are many more radios that are much better. I realize its only a $30 radio, but the audio has to be at least acceptable, and its not.I dont need blasting audio, but even with an amplified mic and the limiter cut, it still isnt as loud as some of my other Cobra and Galaxy radios with a stock mic."
2,Disposable consumer radio,"Bought this on Amazon three months ago. Compact size fit nicely into my Jeep Wrangler, the weather scan was nice, had lots of trouble getting connection with other members of my Jeep club. Had SWR meter reading on antenna reflection, nice low numbers but the I had to install a power lead choke to keep ignition noise from blowing away my transmissions. Almost had it fixed, then I left the window down when a small sprinkler storm passed by. Couldn't have been more than a few drops blew in the open window, my seat wasn't even wet, but now the output is gone and nothing displays in the LED meter for either transmit or recieve. So now it is throwaway trash.Going with Cobra for my next CB. We'll see"
4,It's ok,"Its ok, I can't seem to ever get a clear chanele. The adjusting nobs don't really seem to make a difference. Once I. A while lill pick some one up who is clear. But that is extremely rare. I rated this a 4/5 reason is that I'm new to cb's and this could just be user error but I don't think it is. I will say it is fair for the price."
5,Used as an extra,Product was just as stated. I am satisified with the purchase. It was purchased as an extra unit when someone travels with me.
2,Sucks for close group riding,I bought this product for use during trail runs with my ORV club. While the product performs ok on the highway once you get in a close bunch like on a trail there is a lot of howl that you pick up. There is an RF Gain control that should help but in my experience it does nothing or at least not enough to make a difference.If you want this product to use during trail rides I would suggest getting something like a Cobra 25.
2,I can't believe ratings for this radio,"This radio--when it comes on or is turned on, just picks a channel, in mine, usually Channel 33. So each time I have to turn it manually to #19. When you start and stop allot it's a real pain. Mine also has a squeal when I talk (people reply back, ""hey your radio has a bad squeal."")You get what you pay for."
4,Great deal on a good CB,"This is an awesome CB radio for the price. It's compact, has RF gain control, others can hear me clearly, and it's loud enough for me to hear others clearly too. The only bummer is that I connected it to a switched power source, and it defaults to channel 9 when you turn it on (rather than your last used channel) but I can't complain about that since it's the least expensive radio I found!"
3,3 stars means the album is good!,"I have noticed that a 3 star review somehow gets interpreted as a bad review sometimes. It is not. Most users give away 5 stars to every CD they like. I try to only give it to the best ones. This is a fun, straight-ahead rock-your-socks-off record that will please fans of the new rock revolution. Not worth comparing to the White Stripes, because they are much different bands now."
3,"Good, but not my favourite","Chances are, you heard ""C'mon C'mon"" and that's why you want this cd. There are a several tracks on this album which you'll love, but the rest are either boring or just typical songs any band could have. ""C'mon C'mon"" is definitely an outstanding track, and ""Been Swank"" is also rather enjoyable, albeit a bit repetitive. Despite it's shortcomings, the album is still good for the most part-- if you don't mind skipping over a song or two."
3,Cass and Henry,"I'm a big fan of the Von Bondies. They are a fantastic band. 'Pawn Shoppe Heart' is an ok album with some catchy songs, but please do not overlook 'Lack of Communication' and 'Raw and Rare.'Detroit Free Press music critic Brian McCollum made a statement saying that the Von Bondies ""make it ('Pawn Shoppe Heart') one of the better major lable renditions of the new old-rock sound that has been negotioated less succesfully by acts like the Strokes and the Vines.""I heard a local radio DJ say that 'Pawn Shoppe Heart' has enough energy to light up an entire Detroit city block. Well sure, maybe if you count the abandoned buildings with out access to electricity.Yeah, the Von Bondies may have finally created a breakthrough album, but both of those are quite the over statements for a band that can't get past their fear of living in the shadows of the White Stripes."
1,holy disappointment batman!,"If anyone heard their first disc it was very mysterious and smokey...packed with energy and emotion...I really thought they would keep that mood but embellish the songwriting but the writing sucks, the mood is ""look at us"", and they hammer home the point that the ""neo garage/punk/blues"" scene is finally ending as it has ran out of steam and ideas....RIP"
3,"Von Bondies ""Pawn Shoppe Heart""","""No Regrets"" (3/5): The opening track, nothing too great.""Broken Man"" (3/5): Another rather ""blah"" track.""C'mon C'mon"" (5/5): The first really great song on the album.""Tell Me What You See"" (4/5): An exciting fast tune.""Been Swank"" (4/5): You can feel the emotion in this one.""Mairead"" (5/5): A slow, bass driven song. Kick back and enjoy.""Not That Social"" (5/5): The first song sung by the chick. This one might be my favorite.""Crawl Through The Darkness"" (4/5): Another great track.""The Fever"" (5/5): A really catch tune.""Right Of Way"" (3/5): Not really one of my favs.""Poison Ivy"" (4/5): This one is gets you moving.""Pawn Shoppe Heart"" (3/5): A poor closing song."
1,whatta SELL OUT!,"...not that there was a lot to sell in the first place. The Von Bondies first album, ""Lack Of Communication"", was a pretty decent album - not incredible, but it definitely rocked in a garagey/Stoogey kinda way. Now on their major label debut they have all but completely disgarded what rough edges they had in favor of a slick production that has them sound like a cross between The Cult and the Simple Minds, and that ain't a good thing. Even the photos of the band are over done in the air brushing and stylist department. I've never seen a more clear cut case of a lame attempt to grab the brass ring. I'm willing to wager that when the garage rock trend has faded this time next year this album will be polluting the used bins like an oil spill in the ocean."
2,Pawn Shoppe Garbage,"This album completely sucks. I don't even care about the White Stripes association, this is a far cry. The instant I played it I was put off by the production. I thought that garage rock was supposed to be part of the solution! This album is boring at best. It's not the worst album I've ever heard, if it was I would have to give it some credit. The problem seems to be that the Von Bondies wish they were as famous or as respected as most of the other bands from Detroit are. So it's clear that they've made a lame attempt at commercial success. I give this two stars just because their first album was pretty good, but Pawn Shoppe Heart makes that seem like Sgt. Pepper! Oh well, better luck next time.If I were you, I'd think twice before I waste money on a band whos claim to fame has Jack White's knuckle scuffs all over it.Think about it."
2,"Please, no more.","Before buying this album I had heard only the few songs from the VBs' website. They all had that dirty echo I love so much, the same one you hear with the White Stripes, the Strokes, et cetera.I buy the album and make it through the first seven or so songs...then the girls start singing. But they can't really sing too well. It's, erm...well, the first part of the album was good, so maybe this will--well, no, it's not going away. In fact, the girls keep singing. Oh no, my eye's twitching and I can't get it to stop.I guess what I'm trying to say here is that about half the album's good and the other half is crap. I cannot stand the girls' voices. They're painfully monotone and leave this horrible dry pink taste in your mouth.But Jason's voice is so full of passion that in some cases you have to hold your heart together. It can get a bit old though...So if you buy this one, buy it used. Pay only for the good half of the album."
4,No mute,"No mute, otherwise it would be awesome. We use this with h91. The QuicckDisconnect telephony headsets are far more convenient for training purposes, so we use QD headsets with these adptors for our voip applications."
1,DISAPPOINTED,"This book was rated as being in ""VERY GOOD"" condition. I went to open the book and the cover almost fell off. There's only a little bit of glue holding it on the spine. Also there were a lot of crayon marks on the inside front AND back cover. Definitely not ""VERY GOOD""!"
3,Very Disappointed,"The Basic of basic books on Visual basic 6, mainly concerned with the visual basic 6 controls and use, few samples of code and no 'hands on' practical programming. I would not recommend this book as a learning tool for writing VB6 code."
3,Better than Volume 1,"This book is much better than vol. 1 (Dodge, Ply. and Chrysler Police Cars 1957 - 1978). That still doesn't say much, as the writing is elementary, repetitious and it's quite apparent that the author thinks that Chrysler never made a bad police car. I'd like some objectivity here. The info is there, you just have to hunt for it and make use of peculiar table formations (although again, at least there seems to be a modicum of uniformity in the tables versus the first volume). I had high hopes for this book, and I'm still waiting for an excellent book on police vehicles. I've yet to see one!"
5,Includes A History Of Models From 1979 On,""".....The book INCLUDES A HISTORY OF MODELS FROM 1979 ON, including the Dodge St. Regis, Chrysler Newport, Dodge Diplomat, K-cars Dodge Aries K and Plymouth Reliant K, Jeep Cherokee and Dodge Intrepid.....""[from the book of the back cover]"
4,"Castrol CST06460 GTX High Mileage 10W40 Motor Oil ? 1 Quart, 6-Pack",This product was purchased for a friend. He was having trouble finding it in local stores. It has always worked well for him.
5,Solved my oil loss,"I have a nine year old vehicle which was losing about 1/2 quart per 1,000 miles. The problem was small leaks through gaskets in multiple locations. I changed to this oil, and after 1,200 miles, no loss at all."
3,Definitely not the Super Deluxe I remember,"I saw this band live in Minnesota back in the 90's. Their live show was incredible, but this cd is not. The singing reminds me of big bird."
3,A look into Jimmy Page before Led Zeppelin,"This CD has two parts. The first 14 tracks are of various singers with Jimmy Page playing guitar on the recordings. They're tuned to more of the ""oldies but goodies"", pre-Beatles listeners.The last 6 tracks have Page, Bonham, and Jones blasting out 1970 atomic metal with Screaming Lord Sutch on vocals. The difference between the 14th and the 15th track are quite contrasting, so be prepared for a jolt.The entire CD is a great exposition of Page's development as Britain's axeman, and is well worth a listen to by anybody that admires his fretwork."
3,No intro needed,"The 1st part of this disc is a great little compilation with the various session guys that were big in England in the '60s just doing some songs they all liked. John Paul Jones is featured on some tracks along with Jimmy Page and Albert Lee... The last stuff is the Screaming Lord Sutch songs... If you want these two compliations get them in their proper way, No Introduction Necessary without the Lord Sutch stuff...and then get the Lord Sutch complete album which should have songs by both Jimmy Page and Jeff Beck."
3,A Fitting Title,"To begin, if you own ""The Masters"" or ""Lovin' Up a Storm,"" then you own this album, but under a different name. The idea behind this, was to promote the unknown Albert Lee (singer) by advertising Page and Jones, who were the studio musicians. Mainly, unless you are into late 50's or rockabilly, this is not for you. If you are, however; jump in head first. Dixie-Fried has a ""let's all get wasted,"" but humorous context. My personal favorite is One Long Kiss, because of its smooth and low groove.This CD earned three stars because the guitars and drums are okay and Lee is actually an accomplished singer, but it gets no more, because this is not the Page and JPJ that everyone loves."
4,Late 60's curiosities,Page plays on 6 songs with Keith de Groot that sound like the rockabilly Elvis was singing in the 60s. They're done well enough but for the most part it just sounds like a cover band. Its just too bad Page wasn't around for the 9 minute blues tune(One Long Kiss.) Both de Groot and Sutch are only average vocal talents. Apparently their talents were mostly visual. Page does sound pretty good on Burn Up and most of the Sutch material of which he co-wrote 4 of the 6 songs.
4,Some nice tips,"There were quite a few techniques in here for relaxation; however, I found that The Anxiety and Phobia workbook by Edmund J Bourne had the same techniques and more information to offer me."
3,Over kill,"I bought this book for my mother and my mother in law (whom I love by the way)as a reference to stress management. The comment they both gave me was while it was a comprehensive book It was a bit overwhelming. The book had so many different approaches to the problem that they didn't know where to start or what part to focus on. I then recently sent them another book calledInvisible Valium: The Philosophy for Overcoming Stress and Anxiety (Volume 1)and they loved it, because it was short and to the point with real life examples. So now they keep one in their library and the other in there purse for quick reference."
2,Unimpressed.,This book was a required text for a health psychology class. I was pretty upset when I found out it was packed full of exercises that more often than not amount to a placebo effect or just distract you from whatever stressors you may have. None of the information in this workbook needs to be paid for. I'm sure you can find all of it online with a simple google search. Save your money for a vacation instead.
4,"Really good, but I found a better one yet","This book is really good, but I bought another one around the same time on pretty much the same subject and I think I like it better. It's called The Anxiety & Phobia Workbook. It has alot of the same information in it, but I like the way it's layed out a little better. It also explains more about where phobias and anxiety disorders come from and helps you figure out what catagory you lie in. This helps you treat your condition more effectivly. As I haven't read much of this book as I have the one I like better, I can't honestly say what is or isn't in it. Though I get the impression that it's mostly for people who want to deal with everyday, generic stress and not so much real, irrational disorders. Alot of the same techniques are used in dealing with both though and that's why I still give it a respectable 4 stars."
3,good enough,"The book was o.k., but had more handwritten comments on the pages and highlighted marked sentences than I expected from the description. Considering this, the book should have been cheaper.."
2,Borring Book,"Did not get past the first few chapters, exercises did not work. Waste of money. I use it to hold up my window."
2,Beginner Relaxation and Stress Reduction Workbook,The principles that this workbook carries the reader are correct and logical. But books like those make me skeptical that by filling out a few lines about a major problem in your life will make a difference. I would recommend it for someone completely unaware of relaxation and stress relief principles. It could open the door to begin a journey.
4,Great Overview,This is probably the first self-help book I ever read and it was very helpful in reducing my stress. I'm happy to see that the authors have done a nice job of continuing to update the principles and tools. I think this is particularly useful for someone who wants an overview of the strategies that are available and not so great if you have read a lot of self-help books about stress and anxiety. The workbook format is also helpful as reading a book is minimally effective if you don't make an effort to enact the tools provided. You will get a lot more out of this book if you use the workbook -rather than just reading the material. If you are having a hard time relaxing or don't want to take a lot of time out to practice stress reduction strategies - try the book Active Relaxation.Active Relaxation: How to Increase Productivity and Achieve Balance by Decreasing Stress and Anxiety
5,Stress Be Gone,"This book is a great tool to use in finding out more about yourself and how your own body responds to external stimulants that have been creating symptoms unawaredly inside yourself due to a big bully (STRESS). Its not eternal truth but definitely a good resource to assist you in understanding your human body and your default coping methods to our world while helping you in learning how to manage these issues through clinically proven techniques that can now be done anytime or anyplace with the help of ""The Relaxation and Stress Reduction Workbook."""
4,Great techniques for stress reduction,"I really liked this book. It presented multiple techniques plus gave me the approximate time period it would take to learn the technique. I was able to fit my particular stress reduction and relaxation needs by taking a little ""test"" at the beginning. Since stress is a normal part of life, having techniques at my disposal, especially those I can do while still sitting in a meeting, are very helpful."
2,Kindle version of this is terrible,"I downloaded this yesterday and later when I went to read it, the Kindle format is a disastrous mess. The pages are incomplete, some are missing, cut off at the bottom and the exercises don't correspond with the correct pages or chapters. Very disappointing and ironically a bit stressful considering its subject matter is stress REDUCTION and relaxation....This book was recommended to me so I'll just have the download refunded and buy the paper version."
5,Great price!,"This a rather large book that is required for my class. It is a workbook, so I wanted a new one. I was pleasantly surprised by the price. As always fast shipping with prime and brand new just as promised."
4,Pretty good.,"I have panic disorder with general anxiety and this book was recommended to me by my psych. I have been using meditation and self hypnosis for years so I decided not to use those techniques. For my panic disorder I decided to try the chapter facing worry and anxiety. I spent a few weeks learning the applied relaxation techniques and Have recently started visualizing stressful situation. The techniques have helped, but I still have serious anxiety issues."
5,BRILLIANT!,This book is amazing. I have used it for school and with my clients. I highly recommend this item for personal and professional use. The activities are helpful and easy to understand.
4,Good tool,"This book contains exercises that can be done as a lay person or professional, with groups or individuals - even on yourself. The exercises are designed in such a way that they can be customized to your need. I bought it to get a technique to use on my classmates and one guy got so relaxed, he actually dozed off! I think that shows the effectiveness of relaxation therapy! This is a good tool to get ideas and helpful exercises for personal or professional use."
3,Kindle for PC version needs improvement,"I purchased this book trough kindle for pc, the material is really useful being a compilation of many different approaches to introduce relaxation as a part of your life. The only thing i didn't like about the kindle version for pc is that all the pictures and worksheets proposed are not properly displayed and there is no zoom feature to increase their size therefore making it not useful. I'll definitely recommend the printed version of it."
5,"Complete, easy to follow guides for reducing stress","This book is wonderful for teaching people how to relax and cope with stress. It has practical exercises for learning the different techniques.Workbook covers such topics as: body awareness, breathing, progressive relaxation, meditation, visualization, autogenics, self-hypnosis, refuting irrational ideas, thought stopping, worry control, goal and timemanagment, assertiveness training, job stress management, nutrition, exercise and how to stay on track with a stress management program. I've had therapists tell me they use this book all the time in their practice. I'm currently using it as a guide for people in my Wellness Recovery Program. The exercises are easy to teach and practical to use."
1,This book is a great disappointment!!!!!!!!,I don't like this book at all. The author has made this play so confusing. I was confused trying to figure out who is speaking. The author also included so many poems that makes it hard to try find out what the character meant or thinking. I don't think dis is a very good book. I regret my decision of buying this book.
3,"Sounds great, improves performance?","Was easy to install in my '04 RX8, fits good (had to make minor adjustments so that the engine cover would fit) it sounds really cool, but sometimes too loud at higher revs..... feel like i lost a bit of low end torque on my rx8 compared to the stock air intake, but haven't felt any increase of power so far. Get this if you want some extra sound wont do much on performance side."
4,Good,Sounds good notice a gain in HP and Torque at the higher RPM which is fine by me. They didn't add the allen head wrench you need i forgot what size it is but you'll see.
5,BIG and Easy to Clean,"Title says it all. I've already used it twice; like the even-ness (is that a word?) of the baking. The pan looks like new after a gentle cleansing; love it ! Breads, meatloaf - it's all good."
1,Product Better than Shipment,"I recently purchased (2) irons for Fathers Day - same iron for 2 different gifts. I clearly stated that I needed it by Fathers Day and was willing to pay whatever shipping costs (xtra) would be - I placed my order a week prior to Fathers Day. It took over three weeks to recieve the product. When I e-mailed the company they stated that they were busy -then when I did recieve the box almost 4 weeks later - there was only one in the box - I then e-mailed again with a carbon copy of the reciept where I was charged for two - they said I was only charged for one - they later shipped another one, after numerous agervating e-mails - all in all this process was ridiculous - I would not recomend to anyone ordering."
4,Satisfied Customer,This is the first time I ordered a used product. I was pretty desperate as this book is fairly old and out of circulation. But I really wanted to give this book to a very good friend who lost his mother suddenly and very unexpectedly. I was pleased with the quality of the product and was most happy it was in good condition.
3,Some pretty good extras...,"Nothing really wonderful but a commentary by the director which covers the bases (without going once into its troubled production and post-production history) and a couple of documentaries (one the electronic press kit and the other produced by the Sundance Channel) which aren't bad. If you're already into this type of film, it's probably worth the outlay."
1,Waste of Time,"The acting was lame, the dialogue unbelievable, and the story far-fetched. Comparing this to Catch-22 or ""Three Kings"", as the cover reviews do, is like comparing a cheese-burger (with the emphasis on ""cheese"") to a sirloin steak. Although it may keep you just interested enough to finish it, by the end of the movie you'll realize you've just wasted the past two hours."
1,This movie just plain sucks,"The plot is stupid. The actors are all ""phoning it in"" except for Scott Glenn who does his best but in the end is just wasted in this piece of junk. The ""jokes"" aren't funny and the horror is unending.The characters are all stupid and unbelievable. There is no humour in this movie just lame boring scenes that follow one another into oblivion with an ending that makes no sense, and isn't the least bit plausible. The only I thing I came away knowing for sure about this film is that its creators despise the American Military and use every single scene to beat you to death with that fact. Don't waste your time on this worthless piece of garbage! My real rating = 0 Stars But I gave it 1 Star simply because that was the lowest rating available."
4,A caracature of military life at the end of the Cold War,"I had never heard of this movie until it was recommended to me by somebody who was stationed in my unit in Germany. My basic reason for purchasing the movie was to see recent pictures of where I was stationed -- Siegelsbach Army Depot. I was a ""Tower Rat"" there with the 556th Military Police Co.I found the movie to be a caracature of military life, and I found many of the situations a bit hard to believe, but there is such a thing as artistic license. Other reviewers have said that there is a ""dark theme"" to the movie, and I agree. HOWEVER, both my wife and I found the movie to be entertaining. This is not a movie for everybody, but I would recommend it especially for people who were stationed with the U S Army in Europe at any time during the past 30 years. You know, immediately after seeing this movie, I sent an e-mail to a friend in Cleveland and told him that he absolutely MUST see this movie."
2,Fighting on Arrival?,"Joaquin, dear heart, what were you thinking?This is another film that had a great cast with no synergy whatsoever. I can't imagine what the original script must have been like to get these talents to sign off on this film, or what must have happened in the process of shooting it that rendered such an awful product."
3,Pretty Good movies for the era they were made.,"These two movies are quite entertaining. They have been upgraded to blue ray, so the cinematography seems better than the old DVD's. Treat Williams, in Deep Rising, is funny in all the right places. Humor, action, and horror....nice combination!The Puppet Masters was my favorite book when I was younger. The movie is not a bad adaptation and the acting was pretty good from Donald Southerland et al. Good Science fiction."
2,didn't like it,did not realize it was about sea creatures or would not have bought it. not my style of movie I guess
4,"One is great, the other is OK","Love the Puppet Masters! Well done sci-fi movie, good acting, good action. This one I saw before and enjoyed it again....The first time for Deep Rising....it really did not impress me all that much, but was watchable"
5,Two Highly Underrated Sci-Fi Horror Flicks!,"Both these movies were murdered by the critics of the time but they offer up tight plots, great actors, action and horror - all the ingredients for great 'B' horror flicks that hover most of the time around the 'A' level. Treat Williams and Donald Sutherland (Keifer's dad) headline Deep Rising And The Puppet Masters respectively and do a bang up job in both cases. The transfers are great in blu-ray and there's enough action here for a double-feature evening that will curtail your bathroom visits to the intermission between films. Two pros with great supporting casts adding their personal touch to the genres. You'll have a blast!!"
5,A Celtic Frost Classic,"I've had ""Into the Pandamonium"" for quite some time now, and can't say that I'll ever tire from it. This was and is one classic groundbreaking metal album! I'm very picky when it comes to listening to metal, but this one fills all of my requirements. This album has a variety of everything. ""Inner Sanctum"" is pure Celtic Frost at its heaviest on the album. Their cover of Wall of Voodoo's ""Mexican Radio"", is a cool album opener. Tom G. Warrior pulls a vocal surprise which I happened to like on ""Mesmerized."" There is a lot of experimentation on this album. The metal mixed with classical music songs ""Oriental Masquerade,"" and ""Rex Irae (Requiem)"" are both great. There's even a song with a woman speaking French on it mixed with classical instrumentation. Plenty of surprises on this heavy metal classic album."
4,PA-BOWHUNTER,"For the money, this stand does exactly what it is supposed to do it is easy to set up,(although not exactly quiet setting up), but it is a stable, comfortable treestand. I place my treestands about a month before season opener, therefore a quiet fixed position stand is not essential. with the chain attachment, it is lockable with only a padlock. and in the unlikely event that someone would steal it, I havn't lost a fortune. I spent many hours in this stand this past season and this stand is very comfortable, quiet and can easily shoot a bow from either the sitting or standing position"
5,The Dogs Who Came To Stay,"I stumbled upon this book in the library recently, and have since told all my friends they must read it!! I think the fact that it was written by a man made it even more special. It always surprises me when men show their feelings so openly and with total abandonment, eg: Nicholas Sparks, James Michael Pratt, to name a few... The love and devotion that these two Princeton professors had for these dogs was so intense. Their dedication to the animals was astounding and therefore reciprocated in great abundance. Anyone who owns a dog, has ever owned a dog, or needs to be convinced of the immeasurable experience of owning a dog, needs to read this book. It touched me more than any story of animal/person unconditional love and devotion that I have ever read. A must read!"
4,The perfect dogs,"This book is a very interesting, exiting and humorous. It is a real life story of love and friendship, that will appeal to readers both young and old. Remus has a winning, positively personality that people recognized at once."
3,"Cute eyes BUT not on card as shown, too much work to sort and match!","These eyes were cute to use for cake pops for halloween but unlike the white eyes on a card, theses came in a small cellophane bag unlike the photo. Sorting and flipping the eye up was time consuming."
3,Some conflicting statements.,"This book has a lot of good things to say, but some do not correspond with scripture and there are statements which conflictwith others he makes."
5,MIDWEST BOOK REVIEW,"To me, this is a must teaching book for all serious Christians. A book on prayer, spiritual warfare and exercising our faith in a God who loves us.For Christians, the ultimate goal is to be the Bride of Christ. To do this, as with all those who are awaiting their bridegroom, we must prepare ourselves. This book helps you to do that, teaching in a clear understanding way, what is required of Jesus' church, His bride and how to obtain that goal.This bookwill not disappoint you, I promise!Highly recommended! A must read for Christians that take their walk serious!"
2,disappointed with an overrated book,"I thought the advice given was nothing new, cliche-ish and thus very uninspiring. The book often refers the reader to other books for what I believe it lacked--depth and focus. Also I disagree with the writers idea of how to handle anger. They mention how, in early editions of this book, they had encouraged readers to physically express anger safely but now recommend verbal expression instead. The importance of safe physical expression of anger is clearly and effectively explained in John Lee's ""Facing the Fire""--a must-read for anyone having issues over anger especially suppressed anger left over from the past."
2,The book was amateurish.,The table of contents and general outline were acceptable.The reference to diet affecting assertiveness was a big stretch.The bibliography was difficult to corroborate and certain references to books were not found when searching for them by using Amazon.comThe book is worth less than the price asked.
4,"Finally, an understandable learning tool for Proj. Control.","I started my management career using what we called CS2, the forerunner to the Earned Value Management System. This book is a very valuable career tool in graduating to EV. It clearly explains the metrics of EVSM and describes all the basic requirements. I found it to be a most comprehensive and logically organized treatise on the enitre project management field. I highly recommend it to all current and aspiring project managers.Harry Morgan"
1,really bad software.,"After installing Mcafee security center, my machine was much slower. I used taskmanager to see what processes were slowing the machine. It was mcafee. Mcafee was eating up 30% of the cpu just with the machine sitting idle. Uninstalling the software is more difficult than getting rid of any virus. Real crap."
2,"The virus checking surpasses Norton's, the spam killer bites","I just had to uninstall the spam killer because it was deleting my e-mails off of the server before I even read them, even though I had it TURNED OFF because it made everything soooo slooooow!!!"
2,Too much hassle,"I usually would accept McAfee, but I am going back to try Norton, McAfee has caused many problems with hanging the PC, although if you just want VirusScan, then that might work ok, but then why buy the suite. Privacy looked so good too, but it causes IE to not accept cookies even when they are enabled. This also hogs the RAM big time. You can buy, but beware."
1,Please avoid this product at all costs.,"This is one of those rare times that I wish Amazon had a zero star rating. I'm a big fan of VirusScan and bought this to upgrade. The Personal Firewall Plus and Privacy Service cause my system to lock up and the internet access to go away. I've spend hours trying to diagnose and fix. If you put in the time to remove the McAfee programs, you can get back to where you were.Long story short: This product does not work. Please do not buy it."
1,Incompatabliity problems.,"I bought this program instead of Norton for my new computer because I read about how Norton is a resourse hog.Well, I didn't notice a difference with computer speed.But, Mcafee internet security doesn't function well with my other programs.Mcafee won't run with some games and the Privacy service seems to freeze up often.Annoying pop ups from the updater program are frequent and slow down other programs and even ask you to restart your computer.Norton never did this.I am very dissapointed with Mcafee and am going to uninstall it and buy Norton. (I read bad reviews about Trend Microcillin on this website so I won't get that one either.)Don't buy Mcafee!"
1,Only buy if you have no protection already!,"I have been a McAfee ""recommendor"" I guess you could call me, for well over a year and a half now. And I just have to say: BEWARE! I currently had the 2004 6.0 version of Security Suite and I tell you it has been working like a dream!!!!!! No problems whatsoever. Until I tried to upgrade to the newest version so as to stay up to date. Completely took over my machine. I even had to reformat. Tried to install the new version after reformat, and NO LUCK! Wouldn't even let me get on the net even after I allowed my explorer access. So I restored my machine back to the reformat and I have reinstalled version 6.0 back onto my machine and no problems. Other than I have to completely reload my machine now. As well as find another way to update my internet protection.Good luck to all!"
1,The reviews saved me!!!!,I purchased this product beofe doing research since my subscription with Norton is close to expiring! That is another issue in itself! I am SOSOSOSOSO glad that I decided to read the reviews before opening the package. I am going to return it unopened and get Norton ( I think I better read those reviews first lol) THanks to all the people who reviewed this product and saved me a load of headaches!!!
1,I wish I'd read the reviews before buying,"I've been a McAfee user since I bought my first PC. Never had a problem, so when my software was nearing its expiration I bought the latest version without thinking to check reviews. Fiasco: I can't even get through the installation process. (If you're having the same trouble, here's a page that might help you, though it didn't help me: http://forums.mcafeehelp.com/viewtopic.php?t=14467.)Buy Norton instead -- I mean, after you've read the reviews (my new rule: READ REVIEWS FIRST). Systemworks 2005 installed with no problems (except GoBack, but I haven't looked into fixes yet, and anyway that's another story)."
1,bad news,"I purchased the McAfee internet security suite a few weeks ago. AFTER the installation, my computer contracted the iexplore virus/worm. I have tried to get tech support from McAfee by phone. They gave me a 900 number which charges 3.95 per min. I was put on hold and never did get help. They also have a web tech support site which charges another 64.00 for help with for worm that got by their security in the first place. I wouldn't purchase another McAfee product at any price."
4,This book deals mostly with death by cancer,"If you are looking for a book to help you with the healing process for a child who died by accident, you may not feel that you can relate to this book. However, her stories of children seeing God and Jesus before they died did bring me a sense of peace, hoping that my little cousin DJ did the same."
2,Not a gothic romantic suspense....,"I purchased this Willo Davis Roberts' paperback thinking it would be a gothic romantic suspense. However, it is a 70's suspense thriller that revolves around a lieutenant of a militant group, Max, who's plotting to bomb a court house to cause chaos because their militant leader is on trial. I did read the 221-page paperback, but it's definitely not my ""cup of tea""."
3,An enjoyable read,"This book, by Tanya Anne Crosby, was as usual a very enjoyable read. I haven't disliked any book written by her so far, and I don't think I ever will. The Viking's Prize, perhaps, just wasn't for me because I've never read a Viking story before. I just did not like how Alarik constantly bullied Elienor, it seemed that way to me. He did not give her options in any matter at all and basically bullied her into doing things his way - conciously or not or its just because he's a Viking warrior. Elienor herself was a mass of contradictions and it got a little irritating after awhile. Other than that it is an enjoyable story, I read it in a few hours. If you want to read something better by Tanya Anne Crosby, IMHO, read ""Once Upon A Kiss"" or ""The MacKinnon's Bride""."
2,Vikings Prize,"This is my favorite style of book. I only read books from the Viking or Roman era to the highlands of Scotland, and medieval England up to the 1600's. I enjoyed Viking' s Prize, but found a lot of things wrong.. I have an open mind and will read more from this Author, but hope with time she will be able to blend her characters better...."
3,Viking's Prize,"I was enjoying this book until 72% (Kindle talk), when the heroine realizes that she is not only in lust with the hero but also in love. While the hero (though still in lust of course) continues to fight his deeper feelings for the heroine until toward the end of the book. And does not even seriously consider marriage to her (despite all that he has put her through), until the very last few pages of the story.For me the appeal of a Captor/Captive romance is: that while the hero physically captures the heroine, she in turn changes from captive to captor, when the dominant hero falls for her, and I don't mean just wants her. So when the heroine falls in love long before the hero, the fantasy read is spoiled for me.Also I can't stand the habit of too many romance writers of scarring a heroine during the progression of the story, as was done in this book."
4,Great book! Technically usefull.,"This is a great book! I already own DNS and BIND, but that book is specifically for BIND. As a technical consultant on Microsoft networks (...) I regularly deal with DNS. With this book I'm learning a great deal about the special Microsoft differences with the Internet standard of DNS.DNS isn't easy. Especially in dial-up and e-mail configurations, you must implement certain settings. This book really answers those questions. There's a whole chapter on configuring DNS for e-mail servers.Technical depth is quite good. Good enough for most environments anyway. This book will not answer every technical bit, but than you would need a 1500+ pages book. In all other circumstances: GET THIS BOOK! Readability is excellent, and this book will certainly last another 5 years.You will be vary satisfied with this book. I am."
2,Bad Clip,"The case held the phone fine (if you didn't run it into anything), but the clip was cheap and broke after a few uses. The clip was flimsy and loose. Like a said, it broke."
2,You get what you pay for....,"Mine usually last about 3 months and I am out on construction sites often so it gets used. I have to have a holster like this, just can't stand the pouches. So, typically I'll order a few at a time to last me a year to save on shipping costs, but really it does get old and the more I think about it can be costly if I were to lose the phone. So, I'm going to pay a little more up front and get the Sedio holster that appears to be much more durable. Plus it has the sleeper mode magnet so I can finally unlock my keypad...so annoying to have to unlock it everytime I pick it up. $20 more, but hopefully will be worth it."
1,Breaks too easily,"Just like the other reviews, it broke within a couple weeks. The top clip broke off."
1,Flawed design,"The holster came in very handy until it broke. The design is flawed. The area near the top, just above the belt clip handle, has a cut out for the speaker. The cut out leaves very little material for strength of the entire top area that actually locks the phone into the holster. I bumped the phone against my desk chair and I heard a snap but the phone didn't drop out because of the cupped area on the bottom holding it in. So I didn't think much of it until I tried to remove the phone and it just slipped right out. Then I saw that the locking area broke off at the weak spot. This was with a very small bump against an office chair. The very brittle plastic probably didn't help. Thanx but I don't wanna risk putting my new Blackberry into a holster this weak."
4,Great product,"My son has ear tubes and needs something over to keep the ear plugs in while swimming! This is perfect and much cheaper than the one the doctor's office sold and exactly the same! My son was thrilled! I am worried about how long it will last with the velcro, we will see!"
2,Look For The Sea Gulls - Joan Elliott Pickart,"DESCRIPTION FROM BACK COVERThe searing summer heat stunned journalist Tracey Tate when she arrived in Texas on assignment to profile a working ranch. But it was nothing compared to the way rancher Matt Ramsey set her blood to boiling. Intimidatingly masciline and infuriatingly certain she had no business there, Matt resented her presence at the Rocking R...until the fiery wave of desire that threatened to consume them both melted away any resistance. But Matt passionately loved the land, and put it ahead of all else in his heart. Could Tracey learn to share the man she loved with the land that sustained him?"
3,1 cat loves it. 1 won't touch it.,"It would be 5 stars if it came in chunks rather than a paste! My 4 yr old cat will eat it without a problem. My 8 mo old kitten won't get near it. I don't blame him. Although it has all the right ingredients, it looks like mush. I'm having a lot of problems finding good quality food such as Felidae or Evo that comes in CHUNKS. I would really appreciate it if anyone knows of something I can try. I love my kitties like my children and want the best for them. Thank you, Kate."
3,Excellent for your cat -- if he/she will eat it.,Great product. High protein low carb. But my cat wouldn't touch the stuff. Hard to figure how to rate it. But I settled on a 3.
3,Arrives quickly and appears wholesome,"I think this cat food is better than the mainstream, agribusiness brands but it still has ""chicken meal"" as one of its chief components. One of my cats has developed an allergy to this ingredient but my other two are doing fine with it. If you have a cat with allergies this may not be the food to buy."
3,double sided gloss photo paper,"I'm looking for Double sided semi gloss Photo paper, But I would reather have double sided GLOSS photo paper, Can you email me back and let me know if you have the photo paper in stock. THANK YOU0akeybranch53@hotmail.com"
4,better the mainstream,this is the best cd your going to find out there right now. It's funny and for the most part the music is way above what main stream has to offer. what I like about prince paul is he puts people on his albums who have talent not star power. yet there are a couple tracks that don't really fit on the lp. it's better than most and isn't geared toward the club scene bs.
2,What a drop-off...,"To be honest, I bought this cd based on the recommendation of the reviews on this site. I have never seen such a drop-off for a follow-up cd. A Prince Among Thieves ranks among one of the best cds that I have ever bought and yet this cd, Politics of the Business, is not even half as creative, entertaining, or enjoyable as the previous cd. You would think after 4 years that someone who is as full of themselves as Prince Paul (up their with Nas) would put out a decent cd and this one falls short. The only thing creative on this cd is after 2 minutes or so on the last track, Prince Paul does an encore of 2 takes, one which is good, but should there even of been an encore???"
4,A very nice edition,"Although this is not quite right yet for my 2-1/2-year-old daughter (more text vs. pictures than she's used to), it is very nicely done and I'm sure she will enjoy it at some point. The books are small but are hardcover and the overall package is functional and attractive. I was skeptical about Charles Kuralt doing the narration, but he really does a very nice job. I'm also sure these tapes, with or without the books, will be great for trips."
2,Misleading Box,"Despite all the pretty flags on the box, the software as packaged does NOT translate between every language. Only the standard European languages are handled. If you want Asian (Japanese, in my case), you have to pony up a minimum of $200 for their Asian product. Alas, I bought this at CompUSA's fire sale, so I can't return it, but caveat emptor..."
1,Misleading advertising at its finest,"It may be Amazon's fault or it may be the software vendor's, but it is completely unclear what languages are covered by the CD included with this product and which ones require internet access/subscription. I purchased this for someone without internet access, only to find that the needed language (Dutch) was not provided on the disc. Needless to say the product is on its way back. For a firm built on internet-based marketing, Amazon totally and unacceptably dropped the ball with its description of this product."
4,CAN'T WAIT FOR NEXT ONE,This was somewhat different than other books I have read by Beverly Lewis. Can't wait to read the next one in the series.
4,Pretty Good Book,"I would have to agree partly with some of the other reviews. I found it to go very slow in parts, but it kept my attention and I can't wait to read the next one. I recommend it!"
4,The postcard,I especially enjoyed reading about the traditions of the Amish and their religion and differences in their religion. Good book.
3,The journalist carries this story...,"The main character Rachel left me wanting long before the end of the book. Her two year long 'pity party' dragged on and made me think of someone immature and selfish; certainly not a role model for a young daughter. The heart of the story was really carried by Philip, the journalist, as he follows the path of the postcard found in the roll top desk. Without his enthusiasm and desire to find the story behind the postcard, this book would have fallen flat. As it is, the ending leaves an opening for another story but I don't care enough about 'Rachel' to find out if she ever rejoins the world."
3,"good, but doesn't keep your interest as with her shunning","good book, the detective work with finding the answers to the postcard was interesting, but got boring durning some of the process, as reading and figuring ages I knew that the answer would be from someone in a nursing home. I also felt that the strange way Susane acted that there would be something more to the postcard."
3,Another winner by Beverly Lewis,"I enjoyed this book, but it took me awhile to get into it. It doesn't have the interest level of her Heritage trilogy, but it is interesting and I am sure in the next books to come that more mystery will be unraveled and questions answered. Basically, I felt this was more of an introduction to the series and I can't wait to read the next book to find out what happens with Rachel and Phillip."
3,Another Great Amish Novel by Lewis,"In this book, Beverly Lewis brings you back into the culture of Amish society with redemption/healing story with a bit of intrigue. About an Amishwoman who loses both husband and son in a buggy accident, leaving her with her little daughter and the loss of her sight. The stranger who comes to stay in her parent's B&B befriends her and helps her. He discovers a old postcard lodged in a small drawer of his rolltop antique desk in his room at the B&B. The postcard brings strange reactions from the owners of the Amish Bed and Breakfast owners, urging him on a trail after the history of the postcard. Another great book set in the heart of Pennsylvanian Amish Country. Be sure to check out the sequel to this book, ""The Cross Roads""."
3,"good, but doesn't hold your interest","I have to agree with one of the other reviews posted. This book doesn't hold your interest like ""The Shunning"" did. It took me double the amount of time to read, and I pretty much had the plot figured out early on. Still- I am sure I will read the follow up book coming soon from Beverly Lewis."
5,my son loves this toy!!!!,My son loves this toy. He spends hours playing with it. It was an easy set up and it does not take up too much space. A must for TMNT fans.
1,I felt cheated,"I did not see any information anywhere that the action figures were sold separate, until the box arrived. The name ""playset"" gives you the impression that the figures are included."
2,the curse of the grid,"I have carried Thomas Guides in my car for years. Unfortunately, the grid pattern does not lend itself to the Central California coast. Many pages contain only a small patch of map or town. I will continue to use my guides for large metropolitan areas, but this one is not very helpful."
2,Apollo Lunar module Reference,"This is a disappointing publication. The fact that it is ring bound is one ""star"" against it. It is very pricy for a ring bound 'book'. Worse however is that it is a photocopy of another publication (at least another star against it) and in some instances three pages of text are copied onto one page making for a mix of some pages in portrait format and others in landscape (yet another star against it). Because it is a photocopy some of the illustrations/diagrams are of a very poor quality. In addition, when three pages are crammed onto one page the font size, as one would expect, becomes very small. What is really disappointing is that there is a wealth of information here but poorly presented at best. I feel ""ripped off"" for having paid so much for a collection of loose pages. A hard cover, good illustrations with some in color, and quality printing and the cost would have been perfectly justified."
5,A Perfect Pan,"Pan has already been used two times to make breakfast crepes, and I have yet to ruin one. The pan has good heft, it does exactly what it is supposed to do, and it is (in my opinion) a most worthwhile investment."
5,Fabulous,"I dont eat bread since my lap band and miss it, This pan lets me make perfect crepes and get the craving under control"
4,Good non toxic non stick crepe pan,"Very good pan for crepe, eggs, pancakes.Food is browned well but the pan does not stick. cleaning up is a breeze. Best of all its not toxic like many nonstick pans."
1,NUVI VENT MOUNT,"I ORDERED THIS MOUNT FOR MY WIFES CARAVAN. WHAT THEY DON'T TELL YOU IS THE MOUNT ONLY WORKS ON VERTICAL VENTS, WHICH WAS DISAPPOINTING. I STILL TRIED TO INSTALL IT ON OUR OTHER TWO VEHICLES WHICH HAVE HORIZONTAL VENTS. THE MOUNT IS UNSTABLE AND MOVES CONSIDERABLEY WHILE YOU ARE DRIVING. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS MOUNT TO ANYONE, ESPECIALLY WITH THE MULTITUDE OF OTHER OPTIONS OUT THERE. I AM TRYING TO RETURN MINE, BUT MFX, THE THIRD PARTY SELLER IS NOT ANSWERING THEIR TELEPHONES."
2,Design flaw,"I got this product because some states (like California) have made it illegal to use the windshield mounts. It does snap into the cradle alright, but not with the car charger cord installed. I consider this a design flaw, so be advised if you're going on a long trip where you'd need to charge the unit with the car charger."
2,Major Flaw in Design,"This mount has a major flaw in its design, you have to use the Nuvi cradle that came with your GPS, but the problem is the cradle does not fit correctly into the mount with the power cable attached to the back of the cradle. My work around is to make sure the Nuvi is fully charged when I need it and use the side USB connector when the battery gets low. The side USB connector works if you're navigating to a destination, but otherwise, the Nuvi thinks you're trying to connect to a computer. Also, this vent mount easily moves from center to left or right when you turn the car, it's too loose and there's no way to tighten to minimize this swivel action. The two stars for me is the mount fits well in either center vents of a 2008 BMW 328i."
5,"Still and always will be, the best!","I bought this book for my grown daughters because they love the author. However their children ages six through thirteen were also thrilled with the story. You will not be disappointed by ""The Other Dog."""
1,Picture Taking,"Very disappointed in this little book. Nothing new in the book to really help an amatuer photographer. Was hoping for some tips to make my pictures ""pop"". Took 2 minutes to go thru the book ~ gave it to Goodwill."
5,Proud photos for proud parents,"Ron Nichols' book is a must for novice photographers who want to take photos of their children that will last a lifetime. His experience as a professional photographer and as a proud parent shows through in this well-illustrated book. The variety in topics to cover all the basics of a good picture is well thought out. His focus on getting photos that are composed and lighted to bring out the best in the character of your children make it a great reference book. I believe anyone, no matter what their knowledge level in photography (especially if they are a complete novice) can pick this book up and in no time at all be taking photos that are a 100 percent improvement over their current photos. Having taken photos and coached novices who want better photos myself, I have to say I am impressed with the both the material and the presentation in this book."
4,Excellent combos,"This book contains an excellent selection of kenpo-related self-defense techniques. The combinations are practical and easy to learn, and extremely effective considering their simplicity. Now out of print but a little classic of the 60's, I come back to this book when I need to remind myself of some good things to teach my students about how to get simple but effective hand combos going that are applicable to self-defense situations."
5,Great Canned Dog Food,"My dog was placed on a special food diet. Where I live, I couldn't find this canned food..Now I got it for her and she's a happy camper..She loves this canned food. I mix it with her dry food and she eats every last morsel..Thanks..."
3,Movie,"This was bought for a friend who wanted this movie. I remember watching this as a kid, but didn't preview again. I know it made my friend happy."
3,Cinematic Safari,"This classic movie appeared when I was about ten, and I can remember laughing at some of the more unlikely moments in the film. Now that I'm a geezerly age I feel rather nostalgic about it. I have a friend who told me he gets together annually with a buddy to view King Solomon's Mines yet again. There is much stock studio footage of central Africa used here, and it shows peoples and traditional dancing that I suspect is no longer present on today's African continent. The storyline is just barely plausible, but compelling enough to have been filmed at least three times: first in the '30s, then this version circa 1950, and most recently in the '70s. Maybe it's not the acting or the story, but all that wonderful African scenery that captivates me. One disadvantage for me now is that all the actors are dead...Deborah Kerr just recently...and I wonder what the hell has happened and where did my life go."
5,Amazing photography of Africa and a nice story!,The animals were simply beautiful and the scenery is amazing. A nice little story too. I recommend this to anyone.
4,king solomons mines,one of the great adventure movies- coming to disc with xtras next year- superb scenery and one of stewart grangers best roles next to moonfleet
5,A stunning adventure movie.,"Even fifty years after its original release, King Solomon's Mines is still one of the best adventure movies ever. Featuring a talented cast and beautiful outdoor camerawork this movie is an often copied, but never surpassed forerunner of the Indiana Jones' style stories. Granger and Kerr make the most of their respective roles creating real live human beings instead of the usual cardboard action figures that the audience has come to expect in this sort of movie and the animal stampede scene, often replayed in later movies' makes for one of the greatest motionpicture events ever."
1,would not play!,I can not review this item as when it arrived it would not work on our DVD player. I wrote to Amazon to get a refund. I was told I could not get a refund but I could send it back for a replacement. I do not want a replacement as I rented it from the video store when it would not play. Please tell me how to get a refund and I will ship it back to you as it is no good to me. Thanks!Pat Blanchard
5,"Not Chamberlain's version, but OK","This isn't bad, but where's the giany cooking pot? How can you have King Solomon's Mines without a giant cooking pot? Where's the giant spider? It's just not the same without the giant spider from the Richard Chamberlain movie. David McCallum's version gave us dinosaurs, but we don't get them either in this one. In LXG there were invisible men, monsters and vampires, but not in this one. It's just not the same as the other Quartermain movies, but it's not a bad movie."
1,sickinging slaughter,During the first ten minutes of this film an elephant is brutely killed--you can see the bullets smash again his skull. Other elephants struggle to help their wounded friend before they are driven off. i stopped watching after that.
3,PROTOTYPE FOR INDIANA JONES?,"KING SOLOMON'S MINES (1950) not only introduced adventurer Allan Quartermain, but also provided the prototype for Indiana Jones. The screen adaptation of Sir Henry Rider Haggard's famous first novel stars Stewart Granger as Quatermain, the disgruntled British hunter in Africa, persuaded by a whopping cash advance by a British woman (Deborah Kerr) to locate her missing husband.While searching together in unmapped territory among the wild animals and cannibals, they -- surprise! -- find themselves falling in love.Richard Carlson plays Kerr's brother who tags along for man hunt and Solomon's fabled diamond mines.Beautifully filmed on African locations, this somewhat talky, meandering film won an Academy Award for cinematography. Note: the opening scenes include the cruel slaughter of an elephant."
2,Not the same story as the novel,"Good photography, lots of wild life, but the story line is nothing like Rider Haggard's original novel. This is a different story all together: the only similarity is that they are looking for an explorer who was looking for King Solomon's mines and disappeared in some unexplored territory in Africa."
5,Still the benchmark for all future African adventure films,"I first saw this classic as a young boy, and it is still as fresh today. I can't believe that it isn't on DVD!!! The earlier version doesn't hold a candle to this one, and the Richard Chamberlain version shouldn't have even been made. I would love to see this digitally remastered and UNEDITED on DVD!!"
4,Olfa Rotary Cutter,I have been using the Olfa Rotary cutters since they first became available to quilters. This one has an ergonomic to fit the hand well. It is easy to change the blade and the only problem I have with it is that it is not easy to change to left handed use. I would recommend the Omnigrid cutter for ambidexterous use which is important to me as I don't care to move the fabric around and there are times when it is awkward to move the matt.
5,So Nice!!,Great quality and I received in the time said. It's also easier on my wrists when I am cutting fabrics :)
5,Clean cuts,Purchased to replace old Olfa cutter that I've had >10 years. Ergonomic design is great. I use it to effortlessly cut strips of fabric for patchworking. Suggest purchasing extra blades to have on hand. Amazon prices and delivery are outstanding.
5,Great price,This rotary cutter is great. Once you are done the blade closes without you having to do it. It is a safe tool to have.
2,"mechanically ok, design is YUCK","Love Olfa products, and love my 'regular' Olfa cutter, with the push down blade guard. This one is too thick at the blade end, and if you are being precise in your cutting, such as you have to be when quilting, this cutter is NOT for you.You can't be precise, particularly if you are left handed. Buy the original Olfa for less money, and you will be much happier."
3,???????,"To have an anthology cd put out for someone who's been around as long as Sammy Hagar as a single cd is pointless. If it's anything less than a two or three cd package,than there's just too many grade A songs not included. And in this case,there is a LOT of his best work omitted. Infact,most of the stuff on his best of ""Unboxed"" cd isn't on this cd at all!!! I wonder if Sammy even had a hand in the idea of the anthology cd. If you want a great taste of Sammy's better songs...stick to his ""best of"" cds.Notice ""cds"" is in the plural form??? 'Nuff said."
1,Very very unsatisfied,"I order this product way over a month ago. I have not received my product nor have I received a refund. I have emailed the seller twice about my product. After the second email I had to search for my movie at the post office but they do not have the movie. I am never going to buy anything with this seller again. The feedbacks states fast shipping, they must be in the same neighborhood as the seller.Unhappy"
1,Ludicrous,The plot is ludicrous. Almost every part of it is unrealistic. The dialogue is ludicrous. The acting is ludicrous. There are only two or three good fight scenes.The director has no feel for what people would normally do in the situations the characters find themselves in.It's awful.
2,kill Zone is a kill joy,Not enough action. The two fight scenes were excellent but that was not enough to hold someone's attention who loves martial art movies.
4,Good Kung fu action!,"I really enjoyed this movie, lots of kung fu action and a tragic story. A good mix of both. If your a fan of Donnie and Samo you;ll definitely love this!"
3,"Ok Movie, Sub Par Plot Depressing Ending",Recently Saw IP man Series and fell in love with actor Donnie Yen. Thought this would be good movie. it is sub par and pretty much a very short film with maybe 2 good fight scenes.
2,Love Donnie Yen.... but... what is this?,"If the following sounds appealing to you, then this is the movie you've been waiting for - buy it now. My 100% complete movie synopsis:Acting that makes no sense. Lines that don't fit. No plot.That's it. Now for some personal observations from this movie (spoiler alert!):1. Apparently everything in China revolves around father's day. It's just like Christmas is to the United States.2. Super bad guys love being called very 5 minutes by their significant other. It means the world to them.Oh. One last thing. There was some nudity. Which is why this gets 2 stars. Other than that, there is nothing worth watching in this movie. You five star raters are on some sort of Kung-Fu crack."
3,Not as much action as I expected.,"Pretty OK. But, there really wasn't as much action and martial arts as I thought--a bit of a let down. The ending was awkward as well. Afterward, I felt the need to watch a ""good"" movie."
2,Kill Zone,"Sammo Hung is the only reason why I gave the movie two stars. The movie tries to be deep, but it is just boring. Some fight scenes are OK. Overall a waste of time. Again, like in The Protector, it is nice to have the fast forward feature on the remote. Otherwise I could not get to the end."
3,Looking forward to this!,"I always enjoy Donnie Yen, and this looks to not disappoint. I mainly want to correct the prior poster who said Yen debuted in North America in Shanghai Knights, this is incorrect, he was in both Highlander: Endgame and Blade II prior to Shanghai Knights."
2,Nothing like Ip man,I bought this on Bluray after watching Ip man 1&2 on Netflix. I thought with all the high ratings it had to be just as good. IT'S NOT!! Don't get me wrong the story is very good and so is the acting. But I don't watch a martial arts movie for the story. It's just boring. With one little fight scene in the middle and a long one at the end.
2,Time for Sammo to retire or open a Kwoon,"Sammo Hung has a reputation in the martial art world as great as his reputation in films. Hung is truly one of the old school masters, a compatriot of Jackie chan, Yuen Biao and Yuen Wah since the 70's, seen with the great masters tak Hing and Bruce Lee, so when word gets out that he is doing a film with,; 7 sword and the Hero's Donnie, pandamonium breaks out, however this tired bit of tax write off is nothing more then a throw back to the corny bell bottomed and platform shoe detective vs Tong; kung fu fliks of the 70's,Donnie is a good actor, who does no acting in this film but alot of mugging and Sammo has about 3 lines in the entire movie, the fight scenes are of course good but few and far between, not worth the effort, would have been better if Andy lau could bring it up to an adult level like Infernal Affairs. Sammo's US tv stint was a hit but his last 2 movies bombed out with US audiences."
4,Kill Zone,"Absolutely a good movie. Donnie Yen and Sammo Hung are teriffic. Who knew a big man as Sammo Hung could move as fast as he does and fight so well. Everyone seems to die at the end of this movie which is a little sad, but it is a very good engrossing movie."
5,One of the finest films in recent years,"I first saw this film in the theater in the Philippines and had to get the DVD. Kill Zone aka SPL shows some of the best martial arts scenes of any film to come out in recent years but they appear mostly at the end of the film. What you get until then is a taught thriller that has interesting characters. This film is very stylish and and well-directed.I did not like Donnie Yen until I saw this film and he does an excellent job as an actor, martial artist, and action director.This is the film that can bring back Hong Kong cinema."
5,Outstanding Action....,....from outstanding performers. True a very dark story with a surprising twist at the end. Yet a realistic peek into what happens on the wrong side of town. This is a story of good vs bad....family ties and how far one will go to protect their own on each side. The choreography was done extremely well. Both fight sceenes between Yen and Hung as well as Yen and Jing Wu were perfect examples of martial arts at its best. Director Wilson Yip did a great job of directing these Hong Kong superstars.
2,"This film was disappointing, slow, and lame","I have seen sammo hung and donnie yen in films that would blow this movie out of the water! Maybe it's an ok movie, but I strongly disaagree with anyone giving it a 5 star rating and would question their sanity and taste for good movie. I am a movie master and have seen tens of thousands of movies and actually wanted to be a movie critic! This movie sucked! The end!Movie-critic~Shaun"
2,Enjoyed Flash Point More....,"I really did like ""Flash Point"" more than this movie. The story just seemed really dull and I couldn't really feel for the characters (I tried hard!). The action was decent but also not engaging enough for my taste, especially with the long periods of time between it.Also, that one reviewer is right. That fat guy does move rather fast for his size.Don't believe the hype."
2,"I agree with Jamie Kendall,","The description hit it right on the head if you ask me. There are really only 2 fight scenes. Donnie Yen gets 5 stars, the movie gets 2. This will not make it into my martial arts collection of movies."
4,Nice pan,"I am enjoying this pan very much. It is heavy and does not distort from heat. The non-stick surface is great. I enjoy using it for breakfast in frying bacon, making pancakes, etc. This is a good quality product and I am very happy with my purchase."
4,Calphalon Nonstick 11 inch Square Griddle,Not as heavy as I anticipated it would be but it heats up quickly and has even heat distribution. I only use it forpancakes and it works great (no scorching and no sticking).Clean up with hand washing is a cinch. No complaints.
2,Wobler,"I was excited, at first, to get this griddle. I read many great reviews. However, it is very sensitive to heat. After only three (3) uses, the griddle is warped and no longer sits flat on my solid surface electric cook top. Now it is pretty much useless.I did not overheat the griddle. It was used on heat settings medium and lower.If you choose to get this griddle, use only LOW heat settings. Don't use anything above medium-low."
4,"non-stick...for a while, anyway","I bought one of these several years ago (4?). It sees regular use at the family quesadilla pan. Does pancakes, grilled cheese, you name it. Bacon can be a challenge due to the low sides.Like some things in life, the ""Non-stick"" seems to be a warm memory. I have not had any balance issues with mine.I just wish the thing performed like it did when newer. Is it worth the money? I sure think so, that's why I'm buying another. The old one will be relegated to less likely to stick foods."
4,Great griddle,"Wish it was bigger, but great pan. The handle will stay cool for a long time while cooking. Easy to clean. Great price. I feel like I underpaid, but don't tell Calphalon that."
3,"Non-stick, but non-balanced, either","As other reviewers have stated, this pan is truly non-stick, and cleans up easily. However, as other reviewers have also commented, it is unbalanced, and tilts towards the handle side, making it very difficult to cook all items evenly.I paid $9 for it; it's worth that, but I wouldn't pay the current $21+ price for it."
2,its a wobbler,"I used this pan over an electric range and it became significantly warped after a few uses. Otherwise it has been quite sturdy and does not have problems with the non-stick surface after about a year of use now but all the wobbling and ""unlevel"" surface does not make it desirable for a good cooking experience."
5,Love it,"I'm single and like everyone, too busy. I was tired of making do with the pans I had, or not cooking because I lacked the right skillet, and so I bought this griddle. I love it! Now it is easy to cook an egg or anything else, and the cleanup is fast. I generally do not like to use non-stick cookware, but this is well made, and with care, should hold up a long time."
2,Handle too heavy,"I had the same problem so of the other reviewers have mentioned. The handle is too heavy so it does not sit flat. Also, the bottom is not perfectly flat so it wobbles when cooking on a flat top range. The ease of clean-up and ""nonstickyness"" are great though."
2,I expected more,"I own a bunch of calphalon cookware with no complaints except for this one. Its poorly designed because the handle is so heavy, the pan tips over to the side and will not sit flat. Because this happens food is unevenly cooked."
5,Non Stick gets no better than this !!!,"A very well made non stick pan, durable because the finish is the hard anodized type. It's actually part of the pan/metal and not a thin coating like teflon and such. I also have the same brand in the round style and it makes Crepes a breeze to make. Another nice thing is the handle stays cool, unlike my cast iron versions.Overall this is just a great griddle type pan for everything."
4,great non stick griddle,"This is a great griddle. Pancakes, perfect.French Toast, perfect. Heats and cooks evenly..super easy clean-up..lightweight..I like the square shape....and having a handle a real plus...I own alot of regular Calphalon but this is the first non stick pan...works well....and the price was right."
4,Cute book,"It didn't really hold my son's attention. I'm not really sure why. Maybe because a lot of the characters weren't recognizable as Sesame Street characters. Otherwise it does a good job of showing the similarities in all humans (we all have noses that do the same thing, etc.) I only gave it four stars because my son wasn't interested after 2 or 3 reads."
4,Loved It!,I love to purchase books where my nieces can identify and place themselves in the story. This book is one that allows them to do so. I enjoyed it and so did they.
5,Especially good for adopted children,"We really like this book for our 3-yr old chinese-born daughter. It not only teaches her racial harmony, but also shows her that her parents are more like her than different. We like to give this book as a gift to other children and it is appropriate for any child. The illustrations are cute and we have had many a giggle as we point each other out in the pictures (""Daddy's hair looks like Big Bird's!"")."
1,I LOVE FAT JOE,"Since I heard Fat Joe in the radio I liked the way he would say the words. The song that i like the most about Fat Joe is ""WHAT'S LUV"". He's the bom!!! HES A GREAT GUY,AWSOME."
2,The Fat Joe Cd,I like this cd because i like the way Joe sings with this other lady I forgot her name though. But they both have a cute voice!...
4,The second in the new Era.,"i started to listen to katatonia with Discouraged Ones, the first album of ""the new era"" (with clear vocals instead of gutural) and i liked it very much so i gave it a shot to the next album Tonight's Decision.it continues with the clear vocals and signature sound of katatonia, its easy to listen to, it also features a cover from a jeff Buckleys song ""nightmares by the sea"".im not very good at reviewing but still, check this songs and decide for your self: right into the bliss, for my demons, A darkness coming..and if you can get this re-issue also check ""fractured"" one of the two bonus tracks."
4,Katatonia coming into their own on this release,"Katatonia is probably THE most unique band in the underground metal scene, I wish these guys could get more recognition than they do. ""Tonight's Decision"" is the second full length release where they started to use clean vocals exclusively, and I believe the vocals on this release were produiced by Mikael from Opeth, and you can really tell!!! They are as progressive as Tool or Dream Theater, heavy as Venom or ""...Puppets"" era Metallica, somber like Opeth or Pink Floyd, but also sometimes catchy like Black Sabbath, CKY, Black Label Society or Lacuna Coil. If you like ANY of the bands I mentioned, or bands like Perfect Circle, Rush, even Korn, Godsmack or Disturbed, you will definitely like Katatonia!!"
2,Alright,"Let's revamp this review. This album sounds like Weezer with a little bit of a temper and a slightly hard edge. It really does. I don't see how this music is considered heavy or hard music really. The singer is somewhat whiny and irritating while the music is as equally interesting. The song diversity is rather absent through the whole album and everything has a monotone feel to it. I wouldn't recommend this album for this band to anyone unless if they were looking for something slightly harder to listen to, and they were fans of emo looking for some darker emo. There is better music out there, YOU JUST HAVE TO LOOK FOR IT!"
4,eyes of a child,"this is a awesome book it talks about a divorce of two parents and a girl called elena that is caught between the fight for her. the mother has a trip with her lover and leaves the girl, nad then she gets abused by someone."
2,I could barely get through this book.,"I think the only reason I finished this book is so that I could write a review of it in it's entirety. Well, that and my mother really loved it--so I wanted to see what she found so riveting! I have NO IDEA what kind of a person Chris Paget is. I don't know what's so lovable about Teresa Peralta. I did not want to know about the part of Caroline the lawyer's life that she kept private. Can characters be less than one dimensional? If they can't, I think Mr. Patterson has invented something new. I didn't like this book. I didn't like it. I didn't like it. There, I got that off my chest."
1,unsatisfactory,I found this book to be one of the worst books written by Mr. Patterson. It was so predictable and the characters and their conversations were so unbelieveable I could not finish the book.
1,"Ugg, not a good book--boring !","This was a boring and difficult book to read. It just goes on and on and on. The flashbacks and endless descriptions and conversations make this very dull. I ended up skipping about a third of the middle of the book , and finally went to the last pages of the book and still knew everything that happened in the skipped hundred or so pages. Normally I really enjoy the authors writing; but this was not one of those books. Dont bother to read unless you enjoy excessive dialog and description. The story was not believable either. A young woman lawyer would not allow a husband to manipulate her like this. I certainly would not not recommend reading this!"
4,Gripping Court Room Drama,"This book is overly long -- I think the author spends too much time injecting romantic interludes and mushy dialog into it -- but by the end, I think the average reader will feel his time was well-spent perusing this intense courtroom drama. The best part is Patterson's facility for showing us how criminal trial lawyers think and perform. Somebody killed the evil husband of the hero's girlfriend and although you might have your suspicions about the killer's identity, Patterson is very good at keeping you guessing. I liked the courtroom dramatics -- of which there were plenty. If you're looking for a spellbinding crime book, this is a good one."
2,Too drawn out,"There's a great story in this book, hidden under countless flashbacks, repeating conversations, and multiple meandering chapters that do little to add to the story itself. Sleazy politicians and lawyers being drawn into a custody fight was too much. This book would have been much better without all of the padding."
1,Heading south,"I was surprised about the stars given by other readers as I found the book rather annoying. The story itself was quite good but i found the characters really annoying. Sad to say it wasn't Richie that I found annoying, but the main characters of Christopher and Terri. I think the author tries to hard to make everything black and white. Richie is really evil and Terri and Christopher are like Joseph and Mary. It just becomes too much after a while. I think a bit of ambiguity in the characters would have made the book far better."
2,Brutal and disappointing,"I'm a fan of his books, but I found this one very painful. I couldn't finish it. At a certain point, I skipped to the end to confirm that who I thought actually did it, actually did do it! I had the person pegged very early on. What's so painful about this particular book is the child abuse angle. I work with child sexual abuse victims and this is a very disturbing book to read through. I just couldn't stand it anymore, but I wanted to see how it would end. I liked the main characters (Paget and Terri) much more in the earlier works. I'd skip this one, if you're reading his books in sequence."
2,"brutal, nasty discription of crime","i was taken back at the too-unbelievable writing, topped with a brutal and nasty result. it may happen, i guess but i wasn't ready for ""america's worst"" most disgusting crime i have ever heard(read) of. but it drew a realistic, very intriguing picture of court, defense, and so on. but the subject was too harsh for me to deal with(i'm 16) otherwise, richard is a great writer, in my opinion. but i find it also interesting, that he gave the most hateful person his own name-richard."
4,"Good, but lacks hoped for suspense","Eyes of a Child is an excellent novel, but it lacked the suspense and thrill I hoped for when I picked it up. It more based on the trial of a murder than the actual murder itself, which I thought it was about. The book does have many twists though they are not resolved until the last few chapters. This book is very good, but do not expect a typical murder mystery novel."
2,Coulda been better!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Alright, everyone who likes Cam'ron and Ma$e only because ""their fine"" and ""their hot,"" their dumb. This CD does not represent Cam in all of his ""Glory."" There are some songs worth listening to, such as ""357"",""Glory"", ""Horse and Carriage"" and ""Shanghai."" But other than those few songs, it's obvious that this CD was made to appeal to a pop audience. It's okay to get your money, but I know that Cam will come back twice as nice on some stuff that truly represents him."
3,don't forget the children of the corn,all i gots to say is why doesn't anybody give props to Big L?L is the reason why Cam and Mase even Hova are where they are for putting them on before they were big. Now the only time i heard L get shoutted out was by Premo and Guru on the start of the Full Clip album. R.I.P to the best MC of all time because he sends garbage mcs to DA GRAVEYARD.
2,'Confessions of Fire' is not so hot afterall.........,"This is the album, unfortunately, that I try so very hard to forget came from Cam'ron - but, what's done is done. After hearing the first single off the record, ""Horse and Carriage,"" I wasn't too motivated to buy a copy, thinking that songs like that were what to expect from the CD. Despite my friends many arguments to look past the single because the album was ""blazin',"" I decided to borrow the CD and peep it. Not only was the record a waste of time, but I was enthused by the fact that Cam'ron was supposed to be an underground emcee, yet, the whole album was commercially drenched. The only joint I found worth listening to off the album was ""Wrong Ones,"" but other than that 'Confessions of Fire' is the epitome of the new style of music nodding heads -- hip-pop, and oh boy, is it wack."
4,I Confess,A great debut by the man that dons himself Harlems Finest.Only the confident can go and put their moms on a album.357 ah man iz crazy. Horse and Carridge probably will be the most known off the album but I know that its not the best song the album has to offer. From this point the game has to be aware that he will be here for awhile.
2,coulda dun betta,"cam is way betta den dat. in horse and carriage, he used swears and tried to sound cool. the radio version sounded better. the only good song is glory, and 357 is aight. but other than that, it sucked"
2,Don't let the fire fool you!!!!,This CD is As mediocre as mediorce can get. Camron has no skills and the only good songs are Horse and carriage and N.B.C. Trust me when I say it is a waste of money. The album could have been done better. I give him credit for showing his mom how to rap though.
4,FIRST OF MANY GREAT RELEASES,"not much to say ,just that in my opinion D-Rugs is his best work a good team-up.Cam,ron is definetly the ""monstar in a whole lotta m.c. 's dreams. peace out from sean."
4,HES HERE NOW!,"KILLACAM IS HERE NOW . SLAMMIN TRACKS LIKE GLORY, 357, D RUGS, AND CONFESSIONS (THE BEST SONG ON THE CD) MAKE THIS ONE OF THE TOP RELEASES OF THE SUMMER."
5,metaphors and messages on PHAT beats,"In Confessions of Fire, everything is not obvious. You may not get the whole picture at once. This is an album you can listen to multiple times and still say, damn! this is tight. Cam really knows how to manipulate words and he has a flexible pace and rhyme scheme. The beats are undoubtedly HOT!!!!!. He conveys messages about cheating, drugs, death, platonic relationships, pimpin' (my favorite joint), the game and a sleuth of other different topics. DON'T SLEEP! Pick this joint up!"
3,"I ONLY LIKE A FEW SONG'S FROM THIS,MOST OF ALL THA SONG CAM HAS WITH NORE!!!","GLORY WILL ALL WAY'S BE MY NUMBER ONE SONG THAT CAM MADE,ALSO A MUST PERCHASE!!!"
3,"Interesting, But be careful in believing it","This is a pretty good video,but this guy who claims to be one of the killers just isn't very convincing.The interviewer caught him in at least one lie when he claimed he got paid a certain amount of money for doing the job,then when the interviewer mentioned that he said something totally different in another interview,the guy was forced to change his answer.Also,when he said that he didn't even know that he was going to be one of the shooters until the morning of the assassination is hard to believe!! Judge for yourself."
1,Uchh,"Leslie Pockell must be the worst, most careless editor ever. Never mind the audacious and ridiculous title. She puts lines in the wrong stanzas of poems. She gets titles and words wrong. She fails to specify when she's only presenting part of a poem as opposed to the entire thing. Some simple double-checking could have prevented these problems. Ms. Pockell must be a very lazy woman."
3,100 Best?,I disagree with the assumption that they are 100 of the best poems ever written but they are certainly worthy of review. I found the selection interesting.
3,A pretty good start.,This is a decent compendium but many poems are abridged and there are no translations of terms to help you decipher.
5,Great for begginers!,If you've never tried yoga before and feel intimidated by the more advanced moves of other types of yoga this is a great book for you. I took the class back in college and still use it now that I am in the military. All I have to say is wow! After coming back from training and trying the sets again I realized how great it really was.He also includes a section for runners and skiers in this book that athletes might find helpful.If your ever attending UAA make sure to try and attend the class!
2,Slow Shipment,"I have no problem with the item I ordered. However, I am very dissatisfied with the service. The shipment took forever (over a month). I wanted to give it to my friend as a gift, and I got really frustrated."
1,I never got it,"I have purchase this product, but I never got it. Amazon had to refunde my money. It look like they have problem sending. They clain insufficient address, but I have the same address for all my purchase, and I buy products al the time, and they are delivered with no problem"
3,"Good voice and repertoire, but production could be better","I enjoy this recording very much and I like the songs. But production could be better, you can hear that the bass player was very much involved in the recording process and the overall recording is a bit rough (but still nice). I do not like the choice of bass and drum solo's when things start to get swinging, it stops the train. A independent producer could prevent this kind of accidents."
2,Flames a Disappointment,"I had heard from a friend to read this book. I also saw that it had such high star ratings, so I decided to give this one a try. I was disappointed to say the least, as a matter of fact, I was unable to finish the book. Were the ratings from friends? hmmm."
5,"Inspiration, encouragement & spirit flow. A must read!","In these changing times, as more and more people seek enlightenment and purpose in their lives, we are occasionally blessed with a tale that provides inspiration and encouragement we can use to nurture our own spiritual journey. Flames of Grace is such a tale. I found it powerful and symbolic, a joyous metaphor for every struggle we as human beings encounter in our attempt to find and follow our true path, to honor our spirit, and to come closer to God. Walker's journey is daunting, described in vivid, flowing prose, but her message is always gentle and loving - be strong, be true, and you will persevere. A wonderful story of light and love!"
5,Truly captivating!,"FLAMES OF GRACE is so marvelous and inspiring that I couldn't put the book down! Each page touched my heart and soul with miracles, adventures, and lessons-learned. Anyone who has ever wondered if there is more to life MUST read this book!"
4,Worth it!,Great for beginners in machine embroidery. Has all the basic info to get started and some great project ideas as well. Good reference guide for use of stabilizers. It's worth it!
2,It is a really old book,"I didn't like it at all, I think I can not to complain to much because it just cost me less than $3 dollars but it was not worth it. Tricks and tips are given for really old equipment some few of them could still be current most of them are pretty dated and what to say about the designs."
2,Disappointed - It's Very Dated,"I bought this book because of all the great reviews on Amazon. Once it arrived, I could barely browse through it before I got bored. I've tried to read it 2-3 times and it's like looking at the 1970's sewing books...very dated, showing floppy disks, etc.I truly expected way more and was very disappointed. Yes, I sew, but I'm new to embroidery and this book didn't help me at all. The author's other book about Editing, Resizing, Customizing was way better and answered more of my questions. With this, I was expecting a current A to Z primer to guide me and got a 1970's style book with little helpful information."
4,Good book for the beginner,"I am new to machine embroidery. My embroidery machine was adequate at teaching you the machine, but nothing about how to embroider. This book answered a lot of questions for me. I would give this book 5stars but the CD that is included is so old that my computer would not open it. Too outdated. I do recommend the book for beginner embroiderers though."
5,Your search is over,These are the best magnetic refrigerator magnets made. I've tried the rest and finally found the best. This is my second order.
1,How can they call this a frame?,"If you are looking for a frame, don't order this product!! How disappointing to receive this in my mail today and find a totally floppy, plastic POUCH. This is NOT a frame. It's clear, thin vinyl on the front with white, soft, flexible plastic on the back that is magnetic. Better make sure what you wish to insert in this is not over a sheet of paper in thickness either. I was expecting a clear ACRYLIC frame.... something with some body to it that I can either choose to stick to a fridge or metal surface, or stand against something. But this ""frame"" is no stiffer than a half dozen sheets of paper stacked together. The description of this item should sure be changed to read ""pouch"" instead of frame. How terribly misleading.Freez-A-Frame Magnetic 8.5"" x 11"" Photo Frame"
5,Best magnetic frame on fridge,"My family owns at least 20 of these in varying sizes. They are great for the fridge as they organize photos, lists, schedules, etc. neatly on the fridge. They don't bump off or break like the rigid plastic frames do. Also the entire backing is magnetic. My 2 yr old loves to take them off and put them on the dishwasher. She arranges the family in any configuration. It is at least a 15 minute distraction. Priceless."
4,Matewan,"I purchased this DVD for my husband. He had seen it years ago and enjoyed it. We did not have the problem that others commented on about the sound, ours was fine. I would recommend this DVD, and no it is not perfect but it is worth the watch."
5,"""Matewan"" and American Religion","If I were teaching a college or seminary course on ""Religion and American Film,"" then ""Matewan"" would be required for viewing and discussion. A fictionalized account of a real-life incident--the infamous ""Matewan massacre""--this film by John Sayles examines class, caste, and religion in a West Virginia coal-mining town. This well-scripted film was the first starring role for actor Chris Cooper, who portrays a union organizer and pacifist--an outsider Messiah who ultimately falls victim to the violence that simmers throughout the film and erupts full-blown at the end. Equally appealing is his young disciple, the fictional character Danny Radnor, a young evangelical boy preacher at the beginning of the film, whose perspective gradually alters until he becomes a spokesman for a new gospel--the gospel of the working man."
2,"Great flick, lousy sound","This review refers to the DVD release, not the movie. This picture deserves better treatment than it's gotten here. The sound is so muffled, I had to watch it with the sound all the way up. Even then some parts were hard to make out. On top of that, no subtitles. How frustrating!If you have to see it (I've used it in my U.S. History class), do what you have to do. Otherwise wait for a better release of this gem of American Labor history."
1,Great film - awful DVD,"John Sayles' best film merits a far better DVD treatment than this technical travesty.Others here have mentioned the film's amazing cinematograhy, fine performances (indierockers note: a young Will Oldham -- aka singer/songwriter Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy -- has a featured role) and stirring story. But it bears repeating that this digital transfer is *atrocious*. The film is presented in ""full-screen"" format, lopping off the edges of Haskell Wexler's beautiful frames. Celluloid scratches and ""reel change"" hole-punches are visible throughout. And the sound, if you can believe it, is worse -- it's in hissy, almost inaudible MONO, for God's sake!Zero commentaries. Almost no bonus extras, unless you count a few panels of ""production notes.""Not worth a purchase. Wait for the morons at Artisan to get their collective act together and give this fine film the gold-star release it deserves."
2,A Great Film Ruined By This DVD,"This is a wonderful film. The story is moving, the performances stellar. I liked learning about this part of American history. But this was a terrible DVD. We had to have the sound on our TV 3/4 of the way up to understand words. Tokoyo 111 was right about the sound being almost MONO. I kept going back to hear things I missed. And as other reviewers have mentioned, the DVD only allows a ""full screen"" option, so you miss most of the great frames of this film.I appreciated the opportunity to see this film, but have no idea why Artisan would present it so poorly. My guess is that they don't expect many people to be interested in the film and did as little as possible to clean it up. A very low budget production. Really does a good film injustice."
5,Best Video Ever!,"This video is special to me because of where it was made. We are from West Virginia and my Dad was born and raised in Mingo County. My Grandpa worked in the mines back then to, so its like apart of our family history. It's just the best video ever!"
4,A Movie that people will learn from,"I found the movie to be very good. The sole problem is that there is so much information to convey in a short period of time, there had to be some glossing over of the events that transpired.Being a big issue for the region at the time, the movie captured the feel of the plight of the area so well. If you are looking for more information and in greater depth than the 127 minutes of the film allows, try and find the book ""Night Comes to the Cumberlands"" by Harry M Caudhill which deals with the plight of the miners.Having the miners paid by company scrip and the shops (owned by the companies) taking scrip for their goods only was such a cunning move."
5,matewan,"thug to hillbilly: where'd you get that old gun, son - the Spanish-American war?hillbilly to thug: nope, war 'tween the states.I bought this CD about 15 or 20 years after I saw this movie the theater, but that line has always stuck with me!Lots of other winning lines as well. I'm surprised this film doesn't have a huge following!"
5,A Stunning Look at the Industrial Warfare of the 1920s.,"This is an extraordinary film. I use it in my labor history class to help students understand the industrial warfare of the 1920s. Chris Cooper gives a stunning performance. The character he plays helps students to understand the convictions and motivations of a former Wobbly and to see how union organizers put their lives on the line.Matewan offers students a rich portrait of the fight for unionization that I could not provide them in any other way. The only trouble my students had was with the Southern accents. I wrote up an outline for them, including some of the outstanding quotes from Chris Cooper's character, and that seemed to help.Many of my students purchased this film so they could watch it again at home.Highly recommended."
4,Francisco nos sorprende una vez más,"Es cierto que no estamos acostumbrados a que nos cambien los estilos de ciertos cantantes, y este es el mejor ejemplo. Valoro el hecho de que Céspedes se de una oportunidad para explorar otros ámbitos de la música, que tal vez no son de mi total agrado, sin embargo, rescato temas como ""Lloras vida"",""Dicen"" y ""Se me va"", que hacen salir lágrimas por esa voz tan especial y su fabulosa intgerpretación."
3,unusual read,This is not your usual Doyle but with enough interesting stories to be interested and keep turning the pages with strange and unusal tales of doctors and their lives.
5,Dreamworks Halloween Double Pack Scared Shrekless/Monsters vs Aliens,"Great movie; kids loved both movies. Great price and deliver was overnighted. Skrek and Monsters vs Aliens both movies I enjoyed watching w/my kids and their cousins. Ages 4,5,6, and 9. Thanks Amazon."
5,Couldn't Be Better,"I received the product, a pair of tennis shorts, two days after placing the order. They almost arrived before the e-mail telling me that I had purchased them. All in all, a terrific fit, a great price, and a satisfied customer who won't hesitate to use this merchant again."
5,Deep heat,"I have always had pain in the small of my back when exercising. While in high school, the coaching staff, would rub this or something very similar to the smell and color on the small of my back and I wouldn't have any pain during the football game."
4,"its ok, no perfect, but work",The two shavers I bought arrived closed and new but the LED light doesn't work. They should turn on and not do it.
1,Junk - Do Not Order,"As others have mentioned this thing is cheap and hardly works. I used it a few times and like other have mentioned, you can't just turn it on. It has to be fiddled around with to get it to work. After using it about a dozen times mine now will not turn on at all, and is headed for the garbage can."
1,Best for nose hair is Andis Professional 04710 T-Outliner,This thing is a hunk of junk.. total waste of time ... I have found that the best thing for trimming nose hair is the Andis Professional 04710 T-Outliner Personal Trimmer ... works great and lasts forever..
1,excessive shipping,"ideavillage charged $27.96 to ship a small one pound box of smoothe aways - completely excessive, and when I called to complain they transfered me to nonexistent customer, now when I call it goes directly to the nonexistent customer service number - they really suck!"
1,Poor quality,"The device failed after first use. Only the light remains functional, blade does not work. Do not recommend for any use."
1,Garbage,"This is a flimsy piece of garbage that doesn't work well, looks and feels cheap, and is a total waste of money."
1,TERRIBLE,This thing is a piece of crap. Does not shave anything! Dull and weak! Do not waste your money on this trimmer
2,Not an improvement,The early micro touch units were great little trimmers and while the need to replace their blades every so often was a little anoying it was better than this peice of junk which can barely shave lint let alone body hair. Im glad I didnt pay very much for this item that way at least Im not out what the original micro touch cost.
1,ITEM IS IN INFERIOR TO WHAT I EXPECTED,I HAVE WRITTEN TWICE TO LET SOMEONE KNOW THAT THIS ITEM DOES NOT WORK FOR ME.IT WILL NOT EVEN TRIM THE HAIR ON THE BACK OF MY NECK. I HAVE BEEN TRYING FOR THREE WEEK TO GET RETURN AUTHORIZATION FOR THIS ITEM WITHOUT ANY LUCK.
2,Max Trimmer,Does not do a good job of trimming.I love you guys and you do such a great job.Praise the Lord!
2,DOES NOT PERFORM AS DEPICTED IN THE TV AD,Saw the TV ad several times. Shows the product working efficiently trimming facial hair;nose hair and eyebrows. Received the product and was very disappointed. Does not work on nasal hair and eyebrows. Works poorly on facial hair. I am not using it at all.
1,Not a durable product,The microtouch trimmer broke on the second use. This is the second time I have had a microtouch that broke this way.
1,Don't waste your money,"Used this once and it barely worked then. This was a waste of money, I would've gotten the same result if I threw my money in the garbage."
1,didn't like it,bought it for my husband and he didn't like it at all. In fact it broke all most immediately. Not a good product
2,u wont understand this album,"you may find the production ill and 4-5 songs without Rza raping you""ll undstand the rest of the songs are by artist that dont even speak english.2.5 rating cuz i didnt understand the songs ""north sea"" is ill which is by a artist called diaz."
5,Wow! Grand Funk at their best,"This was the first album I ever bought of GFR. I put the poster on my wall and played the record to death. If you never got the opportunity to see GFR play live during this time then this is about as close as your going to get. This is the ultimate live album experience and displays GFR in their prime...raw, hard-rockin', funky and LOUD! I had the rare opportunity to see GFR about two years after this recording was released. It was the first concert I ever went to. I was third row from the stage and I was literally deaf for a week! I felt like my entrails were coming out from Mel's thundering bass. Those were the days. So get this CD now and save your rock n' roll soul and don't forget to play it blistering loud and discover why GFR was the number one live act of their time."
2,CAPITOL BLOWS IT AGAIN! GFR LIVE ALBUM CD/NO POSTER REPRINT!,"Well, CAPITOL BOZOS blew it again with a CLASSIC ALL TIME GFR ALBUM REISSUED ON CD! Yeah the CD sounds OK, not great still, but the POSTER was a HUGE COLLECTORS item in this 2 LP set also. What do the CAPITOL BOZOS do? CUT OUT THE POSTER REPRINT! Buy the 2 CD UK or Holland set with poster for STRONG GFR COLLECTORS only."
5,Are you ready? Hell Yeh!,"This album is really great as most of the reviewers have already said... it really brings back memories of Junior High for me. GFR was the first rock concert I ever attended... Octiber 1971 at The Forum in Los Angeles... this album comes closest to what thet concert was like. I can't describe the ferocity and sheer hippie magnetism that this group had in the early '70s... it would be very hard to describe the feeling of the times... these guys must have scared the pants off anyone right of center. Raw, loose and scary, few young'ns these days will relate to GFR but it's a great time machine for us old enough to remember."
5,The Greatest Live Album Ever!!,"This is the loudest, rawest, most savage kick a$$ rock and roll record ever recorded! It never gets the respect it deserves. The only other live album that comes even close is Live at Leeds or maybe No Sleep Till Hammersmith. Before morphing into a radio friendly pop band (The Locomotion), Funk were the heaviest thing going. Nobody could touch them...Zep, Purple, nope. What's really cool is Mel's bass is high in the mix ala Entwistle and it really drives the band. And Mark has a guitar sound like no other mainly due to the Messenger axe going into the West amps. This generation needs to hear this album if they think Green Day is heavy!! Absolutely Essential. My favorite album of all time."
5,Live Perfection,"A moment in time to cherish, when everything came together perfectly and before commercialism took over the group. No dubbing, no support musicians-just three gentlemen in sycnh with one another and their audience. A raw and powerful performance as impressive today as it was when it first hit the shelves. I am still impressed with front man Mark Farner's ""words of wisdom"" to the audience."
4,Great Music - Terrible Recording,"This one is really hard to review - what is here is amazing with so much energy! Takes you right back to 1970 in all its glory! However the sound quality of the recording is really bad and difficiult to listen to. ""Live - The 1971 Tour"" has much better sound and a terrific rockin version of Footstompin Music but the concert isn't as good - was never a big fan of Hooked On Love and Get It Together and Live 1971 really could use ""In Need."" Note: the live version of In Need on the new Closer to Home album is awesome and much better than the one here. Still recommend Live 1971 slightly over this one due to the terrible sound quality here."
1,How cheap and cheesy can they get???,This was the biggest waste of 5 dollars in our life!!! From a bad plot to worse acting the proper title should have been shut up and kill me.
2,Too late...,"This had '80s movie written all over it from the very first note of the lead song. It continued and continued and continued. Even the mob guys that they used were over-the-hill mob guys that had some heft (pun perhaps not intended) in the 80s but are slated as b-movie actors now. The leading characters, particularly the two males, are, as one reviewer noted, underworked and underappreciated.If this had been made two decades ago, it might have reached cult status. Who knows? There are worse movies with such status made back then.This reviewer lived through the '80s and has no desire to revisit them in the form of a poorly made film. There's a reason for straight-to-DVD releases."
1,"WARNING! THIS FILM IS RATED ""PG""","Ok folks, let's not mince words here. This film stars Krista Allen, and there's a pretty girl in a thong on the back cover. Not to mention the lead actress appears on the cover in a string bikini. So what the average viewer expects is a romantic comedy with lots of bounce and jiggle. However, the flesh factor here is miniscule.Even though this film is ""unrated,"" it's not because of racy content. This film is a weak ""R"" at the very worst... but the reality is this is a strong PG-13.You were warned."
4,A rare find!,"Years ago I purchased Luv's cassette ""With Luv"" in Germany on the Carrere label. I have listened to it for years. I always hoped that it would have been released on CD. That never happened until this collection became available. This is a collection of all the CDs released by the group. While there are some good songs in the rest of the collection, it is a bit much trying to listen to the entire collection at one time. The track listing for my original cassette is different from the CD; but picking out a song or two from another CD, I can duplicate the original track listing on my cassette. I guess the German record company picked a few different songs, which is OK. Maybe countries do that with foreign acts. I am very happy now that I have this on CD."
5,"Oh, It's Just an Acquired Taste","One durst not get into specifics on this set, or we will blunder past societal strictures of old age (Goldberg), youth (Lupu) and ageism. The set is an acquired taste, but one well worth acquiring! Enough said."
4,Good flick bad player..,I saw the film on a cheap korean karaoke player and realized it wasn't the dvd player on it but the player itself..
3,Needs Updating,"First, I am a life-long scouter and now I have children in scouting. I very much appreciated this book and the values that it has to offer. The 'problem' is that the references and contributions are now very dated and so it no longer reads with the same impact that it once likely had. Several of the contributors have died, been fired, moved on, and so forth. Would be a great 'second edition' project for the authors."
4,Getting my collection back that I lost in Hurricane Katrina,"Book was in very good condition, and I received it in a timely manner. I am trying to get all of Beverly Jenkins books. I lost all of them in Hurricane Katrina, and was glad to be able to get a copy of Topaz."
5,Excellent,Loved this book! The was a wonderfully funny and romantic read. It also prompted my interest in the black Seminole Indians.
1,Topaz,I ordered this book as a gift for a friend in early October. It is now the end of November and she has not received the book. Please trace this shipment. I am requesting that another copy of the book be sent or credit my account for the cost of the book plus the shipping and handling fees.
4,Awesome Writer,"Beverly Jenkins is an awesome writer. Her characters are loveable, funny and a pleasure to get to know. My kindle LIBRARY is filled with most of her books. I recommend her highly"
5,Fantastic,"My first Jenkins novel & I can only hope I find other works of hers as good as this one. I was concerned about setting taking place in such an old time period, but thankfully found that it did not impact the story negatively. The uber-romantic story line was perfect and just amazing. It had surprising spunk and wit & I frequently found myself cracking up out loud. This book somewhat reminds me of Zane's classic Addicted; this story was clearly not as raunchy, but boy was it hot hot hot! But it reminds me of Addicted due to the amazing story line that grabs you & won't let go. I stayed up until 7am to finish this book, it was so good. Excellent story, excellent."
4,I would like some Dixon Wildhorse after reading this book!,"Topaz is a touching story of love that blossoms between two unsuspecting people. It evolves so gradually and so sensually, that when it does happen, you can't help but yearn for that type of love yourself. There is intrigue, suspense, and very sensual love scenes that keep the reader interested and excited. I've already read it twice and will be reading it again and again and again!"
5,Great read,Ok what can I say but agree wtih everyone else who loves this book!Count backwards my friends (sigh)
2,Wrong artwork,"The CD contained in the package received is the one I required, but the artwork (front lable) is relevant to another title: WATCH.Nevermind, the musical content is what I listen to."
3,Worth it just for track 1,"Some people reviewing this CD talk about all the other works on here and how it's a complete album. For me, without this hit song, the CD doesn't offer much (unless you're actually a fan of this group's music) But ""Blinded by the Light"" is a great tune, especially the longer version featured here. This song is made more so by Bruce Springstien's invovlement. It took a very long time to receive this once I ordered it from Amazon (I think it even shipped from Germany), and you generally don't find this CD in any stores."
4,The Roaring Silence-Manfred Mann's Eartband,"Yet another solid effort by the band including another Springsteen song that sounds better than the original. Some very nice guitar work laid over the omnipresent Mann keyboards. A fun mix for easy-going rock, not quite as edgy as some of the other LP's. A few new voices in the ever changing backing vocals. These folks have been around long enough to consider their dues as having been paid but they still don't phone it in. An enjoyable album on the lighter side."
3,Jigga mans Last LP...,"Jay Z never quite duplicated the quality of his first album ""Reasonable doubt"". With the Black Album, it seems that Jay is just rhyming about this being his last LP. This album basically consist of 14 tracks with i believe 14 different producers. The standout track is ""December 4th"" which Jigga raps about his upcoming and is narrated by his mother. Other than that Most of the LP is pretty average. I would rank this album with the Blueprint 2, not the best Jigga material. In my opinion Jay goes out, as a talented MC with not much substance to his lyrics. King of New York? not quite, that title still belongs to Biggie or Nas."
4,Hova Monuments Himself At the Top,"Jay-Z said he wanted to make his last album similar to his first (Resonable Doubt), and include few guest appearances. This is done well, but too often Jay boasts about his greatness (""Encore"") and bringing down his enemies (""Threat""). This, however, doesn't harm the album, but infact makes it more enjoyable, adding charactor to the ending climax of Shawn Carters career. The lyrics are crafted fairly well to geniously in most tracks, in the usual Jay-Z finesse, and the beats are tightly produced by today's best producers (Just Blaze, Kanye West, Eminem, DJ Quick, etc.). There isn't as much emphesis and feeling in the tracks as in The Blueprint, but the tracks are definately ""harder"", and in contrast, contain far fewer samples. In closing, Hova, the ""greatest rapper"", monuments himself in the rap genre by producing one of his better albums, and his last album. Jay-Z capitilizes here, and does it well.5 Best Tracks:December 4thThreatMoment Of ClarityAllureMy 1st Song"
3,Jayz final album...decent but its not classic,"Jay Z's never really had a classic album except maybe Reasonable Doubt and the Blueprint. The Black Album isn't even as good as last years Blueprint 2 and that had its share of songs that didn't even need to be on 2 cds!Don't get me wrong. I like the black album. The production is great and Jay Z shines on here like on all of his albums.I feel that The Black Album should have had atleast 4 or 5 more tracks on it.Its on the short side and I felt someone dissappointed after hearing it.About 1 or 2 songs on here are forgettable and the rest have to grow on you for you to like them. It took me like a whole year to like the Blueprint 2. We all know Jay Z dosent put out garbage and either youll like his songs the first time or after hearing them several times.I think Jay-Z should do just one more album and then call it quits though. Some good tracks include: Dirt off your shoulder, What More Can I say, Allure, and Justify My Thug."
3,What the Black Album should have been,"In my opinon the Black album was a alright album,. I was dissapointed with this album because its Jay-Z last album and this is how he's choosing to go out. If I was a executive producer I would cut production from Eminem,The Neptunes, and Timbaland. No disrespect to any of these guys cause they do their thing but as far as a last album for Jay z he needed pain in da a$$ doing the intro and outro, Dj Premier, and maybe even a ending to the coming of age story with him and Memphis Bleek. its seemed like Jayz was looking for a club hit and a song to be on popular radio when he should've just spit and made popular radio come to him like he's done in the past when I think of going out on top I think of songs like 22 Two's not 99 problems."
4,hot,this album is one of his best. probly this and reasonable doubt. every song is hot cept' for maybe 2 or 3. my favorite songs were threat and number 13 produced by kanye west. this is worth your money. its a classic.
3,average,"the beats are good for the first few listens, but then it just becomes to mediocre in a purists ears... the guy rhymes the word ""face"" three times in a row... ""at my face, but that mans face, is just like my face""...He's just as mysoginistic, and all he's claims to be the greatest of all time fall on deaf ears for me...it might do something for others, but i guess ignorance is bliss, and if you don't listen to artists 24/7 that S**T all over HOV, then i guess you might think he's good...peace,"
3,DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT,"If you belive Jay -Z is never gonna rap again you obviously don't know mc's.I personally respect his buisiness skills more than his mic skills.I mean lyrically he is clever but more and more he sonically comes off as an overskilled bored rapper.I mean Erick Sermon sounds like he going to fall a sleep but Jay-Z sounds like he is rhyming in his sleep.I've only heard a couple songs from this album mainly ""Change Clothes"" which has a real weak feel to it.Its a pop song completely but since its Jay-z nobody will diss it but maybe me.Doggjoose aka Nazty Nate"
3,reality,"Some of the songs in this albums are really bad, bad some others are really good.To that tuvan uner i got something to tell.You give 5 stars to stupid mivies like star treck, and we don't say anything. (even though we all think ou are a freak)But you give 1 to jay z.if you don't like something just be quiet."
5,Nothing but the best from Jigga,Okay now after hearing just about everything Jay-Z has to offer he's played out now right?Wrong this man has mad skills.He comes with something you wouldn't hear from anyone else but the man himself.With new classic hits like dirt off your shoulder and 99 problems.I would have to give this album 5 out of 5.With nothing but hit material on this album this is going to be a very listened to and bought album even after his retirement.
2,ok.........umm,"yo jay-z aka gay-z, im kinda glad you retired....download 2 songs off this album 99 problems and MAYBE dirt off your shoulder...this album is dirt, buy it if you want but i recommend a 2pac cd. PEACE!!!!"
1,THIS SUCKKKKKKKKKKK,HE DONT EVEN DESERVE A STAR THIS JUNK SUCK.....DONT BUY IT I AINT EVEN FINNA WASTE MY TIME TYPING
4,We'll Miss You Jigga Man!,"Alltright now regardless on how you feel about the Jigga Man,this is a solid ass Album. I will admit that it is no ""Reasonable Doubt"" but then again how can you expect him to top his best cd , yet alone one of the top 5 albums in rap history. That being said the best track on this cd is ""My 1st song"" he goes from start to finish with this track and leaves no one out. The other track I really like is ""Encore"" it has a phat beat and if you have ever been to a Jay-Z show you will know exactly what he is talking about. If you are a true fan of Rap then you need to have this CD in your collection. Jay-Z you will be missed."

3,Halliwell's review,"G-Wizzle for snizzle bizzle gizzle on me jefery wizzle.this album isa beast it has so many great producers on it such as timbalnd,eminem,neptunes etc.the first sigle change cloths produced by the neptunes is a amazing it shows how great him and pharell are at doing songs together jut compare exuse me miss,give it to me and excuse me miss again. this album is hot get it! HALLIWELL AND BERNIE TOWNLEY 2003 PLAYAS!"
1,Not worth it,"As another critic already outlined... this CD has marketing ploy written all over it. Jay-Z even said so himself when he basically declared he was a sell-out in ""Moment of Clarity."" It's funny to me that he can make statments like ""I dumb down for my audiences to double my dollars"" and people still buy his CD. HE'S TALKING ABOUT YOU."
2,2 Pac,Jay-z Is a straight up hack the only reason he did so good was b/c 2 Pac was gone. Everybody knows that 2 Pac was the king of rap not this wannbe Jay-z he even had to take a song from 2 pac Me and my friend. Thats how lame he is and U guys say how good Jay-z is the king of rap. They were on two different level 2 pac 5 levels above Jay-z. Thats why Nas killed him on either. Even Nas is better then Jay-z. Jay-z only had three real heaterz out of all his albums now tell me how lame that is.
1,WHY??!?!,"Why do people listen to this garbage??? I don't understand why rap ""music"" is popular at all. The guy can't sing or play an instrument. Seriously I feel like beating the %*#& out of ""Jay Z"" everytime I hear stuff like this."
1,METALLICA JUST CALLED...............,They want their album title back.Prince and damned want their album title back too.Back to this album...It is awful and sucks big time.This guy cant rap to save his own life.Dont even listen to this.Get ON AN ISLAND from DAVID GILMOUR instead.
1,Best Rapper Alive???????????,"Jay-z sucks. I don't know how to put it in any other words. He is the most under-rated rapper to ever ""grace"" the mic. Put me with some awesome producers and I could sell 1,000,000,000 units. He's got 99 problems but good lyrics ain't one. Don't get me wrong...I love rap (3/6;Dayton;G-Unit;HotBoyz;Kurupt;WU/Tang) but this ""rap"" is truly short for crap. I hope he stays retired...YEAH RIGHT...$$$$$$$"
1,What a poser!,"This guy thinks he's a bad boy rappper who does drugs and smokes weed and does all bad stuff, yeah like whatever! Come on man, please just stop pretending. All this dude sings about is snogging some chick and killing some homies and how everyone is deppressed. What a retard!!!"
4,Hot but not a classic,"I thought that this would be a classic, it's jays album you'd think he put more on than this but it's still a hot cd. I was expecting him to end it a little better, again it was a hot song but not a classic. So i left this cd a little disapointed but its still a good cd to listen to."
4,"Now that Jay-Z is gone, rap will die","Jay-Z is a great rapper and like Outkast and P. Diddy, today he is one of the only good ones. Now that he is gone I don't know if Outkast and P. Diddy can support rap all by themselves. This is exactly what happened to grunge, Nirvana was gone, the biggest part and after three short years following Cobains suicide, grunge was dead. Jay-Z was the biggest part of rap today and now that we're listening to bulls**t like D12, lil' crappy, I mean Scrappy and G-Unit I think rap will eventually die. But he managed to make a pretty damn good final album for us all and since it is rap I won't get into it too much, but just remember, it takes a lot for rap to get my attention. Buy this if you like rap, if you don't like rap then consider buying it since it should be good even to a metal fan such as myself."
5,Gracefully Bow Out !!,"Truly going out on top. A true classic album. Every song flows together good. Really no fillers. Touching a little of everything from lyric versatility to ol' skool production. Jay truly shows his versatility in this album. A fitting parting album. Threat, Moment of Clarity, Dec. 4th, What More Can I say, Encore, Lucifer, and My First Song are all songs that could stand alone by themselves. PSA(Public Service Announcement) can be nicknamed the best interlude ever because his lyrical skill on that one is great enough to be a REAL song! The fact that they all collaborated on one cd speaks for its self. If you have been in search of a classic album here of late, then this is one you dont want to pass on. ~ Change Clothes ~"
4,Thats a nice mutha*****,"First off, Im no MC, to criticize would be crazy simply because im not a lyricist/rapper. Just my thoughts on Jay-Z's The Black Album. And with that said....Its hard to believe that Jay-Z is gonna stay away from the game forever. The greats always leave on a high note. With no exeption for this man. Some traces of the hunger heard in Reasonable Doubt (5 star classic album). Awesome production. Nice to see 9th Wonder getting his. **pick up Little Brother, Listening** Rick Rubin is foolish with 99 Problems. Really diggin Justify My Thug, long live DJ Quik (Quik is the Name). Always have felt Jay-Z. One of the best, lyrically. More mature, ""grown man"" hip hop. Looking forward to Kanye West College Dropout. Another platinum plaque to hang, Congrats to S. Carter. Best wishes with the rest of his life. Breathe and Live Long. Holla at Birmingham 1 last time my buddy. 205"
3,Not impressed...,"Ok, there are a few hot joints on this CD, but there are some tracks that i tried to like but i just couldnt,justify my thug,allure,lucifer,99 problems, and few more that could not grow on me, if you are a jay-z die-hard fan then go get this CD, but if you want quality hip-hop, then it's questionable."
5,Jays greatest,"Get this, thats all you need to know. Its his best work.To those still moaning about Reasonable Doubt in every Jayz review, Get over it, its been nearly 10 years and hes gone onto better things. Jay Z is a much improved artist. Go put Black album back in and have a listen to Moment of clarity.from Jiggas own mouthI dumb down for my audienceAnd double my dollarsThey criticize me for itYet they all yell HollaIf skills soldTruth be toldI'd probably beLyricallyTalib KweliTruthfullyI wanna rhyme like Common SenseBut i did five Milso I havent been rhymin like Common since"
4,"A solid album, but a bit disappointing!","OK, Jay-Z one o the best MCs eva: so it's a bit disappointing that he should leave on this, a great album, but no way near his best! Come back, Hov!"
4,good...but could have been better,"jay-z leaves on a high note with this cd...if it really is his last. although his lyrics are subpar overall throughout the album, the production on this record is top notch, some of the producers include, Timbaland, Eminem, The Neptunes,DJ Premier, Kanye West, and Rick Rubin, just to name a few. The weak tracks are ""encore"", ""justify my thug"" and ""allure""...if he only left these out and had 1 or 2 tight tracks instead, i would have given it 5-stars and this would have truly been a masterpiece."
5,Pleez pleez pleez pleez!!!!!!!!! Help Help Help Me!!!!!!!!!,"I so want this cd so bad, but ive only heard a few of the songs and ive liked all of them but i dont know if those are the only songs on the cd worth listenning 2, so can some1 pleez give me a thourough review about each song. Cuz i want a cd that i can listen and enjoy most of the songs, so can some1 pleez just do me this favor and tell me whether or not this cd is good enough for me 2 spend my $ on, or is this a cd where u should just listen to the trax on the radio."
2,Disappointed...,I purchased this album and listened to it a total of maybe three times because it is just horrible. There is only one decent song on here and you can hear it on the radio. Get the new 50 Cent CD instead.
1,Numba one Jigga?Phony rapper go figga,"Every song off this... cd is like a knock off after every knock off;how many beats, lyrics, styles, does jigga rip off??too many by my count.The first 7 or 8 songs are pretty much the same, phony hov keeps braggin about how good of a lyricist he is, like if he says it enough times people might actually start believin him. [J]ay z could hav at least featured other artists, you know, people who actually know how to ryhme. My one star review of this...must mean im in a good mood cuz this album's bout as lame as jay z's line ""chances are ur wit hee-im""-how lame is that???"
1,Want really rap music? Buy Tupac Shakur.,"It's sad that an artist like Jay-Z is considered the best. If Tupac was alive Jay-Z would be a nobody. This is to Jay-Z, the best rapper ever died September 13, 1996. Jay-Z you will NEVER BE THE BEST RAPPER. EVER. Tupac never even like you b*tch.RIP TO Tupac Amaru Shakur-The greatest rapper ever (1971-1996)."
2,Not so good,"i think jay-z is an o.k. rapper, but i don't like his voice very well. he also thinks he's a hard ass and the best rapper. i think vanilla ice is better. i think his best song off the album is ""dirt off your shoulders"", but it is getting really old. i think 50 cent is 10x's better. i also think ""change clothes"" is the worst song i have ever heard in my life. i think jay-z's lyrics suck too. he is an idiot and has no clue. he talks about flipping off god, but then talks about going to heaven. i'm not trying to pass judgement, but he is definitely not going to heaven. sorry."
4,Most Overrated of all times!,"Most Overrated of all times! Jay-Z been set to be the greatest of all time, by that MTV Show.. but thats just stupid, Jay-Z is in my top Ten, but Nr. 1.. you gotta be kidding me?anyways, even tho he overrated he came hard with this album.. its above average, dope dope production, and hard hitting genius lyrics from Jigga-man.. i cant deny that, so he get's 4 out of 5... i like this album very much..!"
2,"WHERE IZ DA DR. DRE PRODUCTION? LEFT OFF ""THE THEATER""...","I DUNNO BOUT YALL BUT I WAS WAITIN 4 DAT...EVEN SAID THERE WHOOD B DIFFERENT PRODUCTION ON EACH TRACK BUT DA ONLY BEST SONG IS ""MOMENT OF CLARITY"" PROD BY EM...GO PICK UP WSCG AKA WESTSIDE CONNECTION'S TERRORIST THREATS INSTEAD."
5,What more can Hov say...,"This album got so much play from me. I listened to it on a 20 Hr. train ride from Florida to NYC and all the way back. "" What more can I say "" is my favorite track on the album. Someone made a comment about the "" main-stream production "" of the album. I hate those comments !! Why wouldn't you want the hottest producers working on your album ?? This coming from a real hip-hop head who loves under-ground hip-hop. ( Common, Mos Def, SV, ATCQ, De La Soul, Pete Rock and CL Smooth, etc. ). Jay-Z is the greatest rapper alive, which is evident is this album as well as any previous one. The production is great ! With the exception of the Timbo, Neptunes, and Em tracks, Kanye and Just Blaze give you a soulful, feel this [muck] type vibe like the formentioned "" underground "" artists. I thought this album was great, and definitely worth the purchase and re-re-purchase. Lost my 1st copy, and the 2nd was stolen. Peace"
3,Last album but not tha best,"This is Jay-z's last album and it was kinda dissapointin, cuz i thought it was gonna be his best album but it's still a classic one. I don't really think Jay-z will stay 2 much away from tha mic and i think in an year or 2 he'll be back with a better album. Anywayz i'll miss ya Jay-z :((("
5,Jay-Z fades to black,"The Black Album, Jay-Z's last full length album leaves the listner wanting more. This album has set the bar for how rappers are going to have to grip an audience from beggining to end. From the impossible drum arrangement on ""encore"" to the surge of energy on ""p.s.a."" Jay-z goes everywhere in music, takes a little, comes back and makes the ""Black Album"". Truly a masterpiece. Not his best,but not far from it. It's like the blueprint continued. On the track ""My first song"" jay goes out on top with some words from biggie to make the ending that much sweeter. If you're looking for an album that you can't wait to hear the next day get the ""Black Album"" the last real album in Hip Hop."
4,That Last Album of the great HOVA,Love the album i was just disapointed that it wasnt like reasonble doubt one of the greatest cd's ever put out on the market but i can i can understand HOVA wanted to go out with a Bang and thats what he did great album but let me down inside
3,"Biting Ice-T, ok album.","Listen to Ice-T's '99 Problems' from his ""Home Invasion"" album from '94. Just another chamber to Jay-Z's biting, or as others will say, paying homage.Otherwise, ok album if you are into pop-rap/hip-hop."
4,The Black Album from Jay-Z,"Professionals such as Allmusic, Entertainment Weekly, Vibe, USA Today, and Rolling Stones all gave this album positive reviews. It has decent beats made by producers such as Timbaland (Dirt off ya shoulder), Neptunes (Change Clothes and Allure), Kanye West (Encore), and Eminem (Moment of Clarity). The Black Album went No. 1 on the Billboard 200, Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums, and Top Rap Albums charts. What More Can I Say?"
3,"Hot album, but not a classic","The Black Album is a solid record, but not a career highlight by any stretch. In this album, Jay sounds mmisguided and more self-obsessed that usual. The production for the most part is really good from Kanye West and 9th Wonder, but the Timbaland and Neptunes tracks sound no different than everything else they have done in the last two years, and Moment of Clarity - produced by Eminem sounds way too much like Lose Yourself. You make the call on rather its a classic or not, but I just gave you my two cents."
2,"A good album, but somewhat disappointing","After heavy bootlegging and much anticipation Jay-Z's the Black Album has been released. To casual rap fans, this album is worth listening to. However, to extreme Jay-Z enthusiasts this album will be a gigantic letdown. To be his last album Jay somewhat disappointed. His lyrics and songs are often repetitive and lyrical quality is nothing when compared to Nas, Eminem, Pac, or BIG. Bluntly this cd is not a classic. Reasonable Doubt, Blueprint, and Vol. 1 are much better. I hate to say it but Jay-Z did not go out on top and to any hardcore rap fan he needs to put out another album to redeem himself after this."
2,Average at best&using the oldest Cliche in Music:Retiring,I've never been a Fan of Lay Z as I call Him because everything is pretty much the same but like everyone doing there thing I respect the Hustle.Production wise is Hit&Miss.His Lyrics are typical for the most part&just don't do alot for me but the cat found a Formula for Success&ran with it.I doubt this will Be His Last set but hey pull the oldest cliche in Pop Music&the Hype starts pouring in.there will be other Projects&of course Hits Packages&things.
5,nice close-up jay,"jay-z has definitely lived his career to the fullest and now that he has, it's time for him to retire. i loved this album. it is his best one yet i listen to it every day and im not even that much of a rap fan. i loved the songs ""dirt off your shoulder"" ""99 problems"" ""encore"" and ""lucifer"" the only song i didnt like was ""change clothes"" i just thought hearing pharell's pathetic voice in it kinda ruined it but otherwise all the rest were great. the best on the cd is definitely ""99 problems"" no not cuz of the lyrics and what not just because it has a nice beat and i can listen to it. thanks jay for basically the only rap cd ive ever actually liked."
3,I Found The Real Black Album,"I found the real ""Black Album"" produced entirely by 9th Wonder (mastermind behind Little Brother and the Justus League). He turned Jay-Z's inconsistent Black Album into a brilliant 5-star soulful classic."
5,Awesome!!,"The Black Album is an incredible piece of work from one of the best rappers out there. My favorite songs include ""My First Song"" and ""Only a Customer"". The whole album is great though. If you are a Jay-Z fan, you must own this album. I liked Jay-Z before this album, and now i can't get enough of him. The collabs on this album with Dj Quik and the Neptunes are very well done. He says this is his last album, but i doubt it. He definitely put out one of the best albums of his career with the Black Album. You must check this out if you are a fan and love to listen to extremely well produced tunes."
2,"only 2 or 3 songs, might as well download them",might as well download the 2 or 3 good songs instead of buying the whole cd.
4,fan review,"Who ever gave this album one star is ridiculous. They said they have never heard this album. Then how the he** do they know what it's about. Obviously they aren't a hip-hop fan because if they were they would know jay z is dubed the ""greatest rapper of all time"". Jay z is NOTHING and isn't TRYING to be like metalica (who is garbage by the way). This album is one of his better albums. Who ever wrote that critisim didn't even spell copier right!!!"
2,Thank God,"Is it me or is everyone glad JayZ retired, supposedly? Best rapper alive? haha He stills lines from Biggie every album and is the definition of a sell out. I used to like JayZ but he thinks too much about himself. He's a good rapper but do you think you have beyonce because of your looks? Nas is way better, he just doesn't sell out...You want to hear a Hip Hop album, like a true one, download Immortal Techniques albums. This man is sick..."
4,"EVERYONE is on this album, yet it falls short","In spite of the fact that this album includes most of the biggest names in hip-hop today, it fails to come accross as a coherent and solid production from top to bottom. The very best work in the entire album, hands down, is the contagious track produced by Timbaland: ""Dirt Off Your Shoulder"". Highlights worth listening to are the intro Interlude, the funky The Neptunes-produced tracks ""Allure"" and ""Change Clothes"", and Kanye West-produced ""Encore"" and ""Lucifer"". As for Eminem's contribution in ""Moment of Clarity"", I am a bit tired of that same sound. It wears out after a while. 'Nuf of the same formula!While the album is far from bad, it doesn't quite have a spirit or recurring theme underlying all songs, most likely as a result of the diverse production teams across the different songs. For my first listen to Jay-Z's music, I think I might have started off in the wrong album. I will dig back into his previous works."
1,this has all been a joke......right??,"talentless. recycled. cliche. annoying. pointless. 5 words(off the top of my head) that describe this loser. & on a side note why do people STILL to this day, piss & moan over the fact that Fatty....i mean biggie & 6-pack.....er 2-pac are dead. if anything this talentless assclown should have joined them. ""oh he's going out with beyonce"" so what? she sucks too. it's sad to think that garbage like this: a. passes as GOOD hip hop/rap & b. while this is being consumed by the mindless masses guys like Aesop Rock are going pretty much unnoticed. one of my friends once made the comment that ""jay-z is the teddy bear of the rap world."" that statement in & of itself is so stupid that i no longer associate myself with that person. jay-z, i honestly hope this is his last album. & i also honestly hope he catches one between the eyes."
4,what a way to go out on top of tha rap game!!,"THIS ONE FOR ME WAS A TUFF ONE,SAD,HAPPY...PLUS JOY!!I WILL NEVER FORGET THE SONG THAT GOT ME THA MOST CALLED ENCORE...THA FANS WILL MISS YOU, AND SO IS THAMAN... NUFF RESPECT,MUCH LOVE...ITS DA ROCK!!!"
5,Who could of dun it betta,Perfect time to say good-bye. Man hatter out there need to just stop this cd was nasty in a good way
1,Wack,"This is what happens when one of raps best M.C. decides that he's made enough money so now he can put any type of garbage out. This album is by far Jay-z's worst. Blueprint 2 wasn't good either, but at least it had decent tracks on it."
1,"this CD is, oh what's the word...worthless!!!!","yeah ok, i guess Jay-Z is decent, i admit i have his UNplugged album, ONLY GOOD because it's with a live band(The Roots...whom are emmensley better than Jay), but at the same time, he sold out and is a total low-life, with a stupid ass shoe, i might add. But anyway, my point is, before you unwrap the factory shrinkwrap, contemplate wheather it's worth is or not(which it's not), and when you're done conversing with yourself, go buy an album that you can listen to more than twice without getting sick....like ANY 'PHISH' ALBUM!!!!! ya know something that has a story, or at least SOME substance worth listening to, do yourself a favor and throw this in the garbage, please."
3,Jay-Z-tyme 4 u 2 go,"first off all jay z is no tha greatest of all tyme,2pac iz.jay aint nothing but a style stealin,voice samplin bum,thatz y nas and makaveli tha don destroyed thys guy.thys album is O.K. but thats it,its far from a classic.tha only classics jay z haz is the dynasty and the blueprint,thats it.reasonable doubt is good,but overated.thys album u should borrow from a friend,or download,its good,but not worth wastin your money."
2,J-Z is overrated and unremarkable,"Now that he's retiring, he's going to need more money at some point to continue his superstar lifestyle. I suggest he sue the Camel cigarette company for copying his likeness for their camel cartoon character."
2,It's about time for you to go....,"Yes, please retire. Jay-Z has got to be one of the most overrated artists of the decade, and the Black Album is continuing the trend. First of all, Jay-Z pulled out alot of big names for production on this album. The result: it sucks. I've never heard a weaker collection of beats than throughout this entire album and from Just Blaze and Kanye West just to name a few. As far as the lyrics go, they're not not too bad, but not really anything all that special either. He's still talking about the same thing: nothing and/or himself. And with the whack beats the lyrics are over, the results are painful to listen to at times. Fade to black is right. This is the end of a career that started off great and went down from there. Listen to some old Jay-Z and compare....Dangermouse did a great job with the beats on his remix album if you want to hear the Black Album lyrics with good production however."
5,superb,"ive only just developed a love for Jay-z and i think this album is absloutly brilliant as is the artist! its a recomended buy, borrow or download!"
4,I LOVE IT!!!!!,EVEN THO I HAD TO ADJUST TO SOME SONGS BUT I STILL LOVE IT!!!I STILL THINK HE COULD'VE COME ALITTLE HARDER THEN THAT BUT HEY COME ON NOW IT'S JIGGA MAN...JAY-Z U GOTTA LOVE HIM!!!!
5,The End...,"Jay-Z is going out on the top of HIS game. He exits stage left with the crowd on their feet. Jigga has held the game down for years with banger after banger after banger. Not many mc's have done that. Only Biggie, Pac, and Eminem (to name a few) have been consistant with music good to the ear. These days, people who call themselves mc's are consistant with crap. Recording about cars, hoes, money. None of the stuff is original and is just plain noise. Yes, I am hating on bad music. I recently bought a cd by this so called rapper who's album is named after food and drink, and the only decent song on there is the video played out on MTV & BET. The songs are whack. He is actually disturbing my piece of equity that I gave away for his cd. CRAP I tell ya'. Anyways, Jay-Z truly be missed by those who're REAL fans of Hip Hop."
1,Pitiful,"Jay-z lacks anything, but the ability to take advantage of a good thing. After his phenomenal Reasonable Doubt he could relax and lower his standards to attract new fans. It is a sad choice he has made; and the array of albums consequent to Reasonable Doubt are reminders of the killed potential. The lyrics on these consequent commercial albums have gotten exceptionally weak and the beats have regrettably departed from the original jazzy melody; the Black Album gauges just this separation from the original. Every album after Reasonable Doubt has been a backstab to the original fans as his lyrics and content plummeted and plummeted and plummeted until he has made a weak retirement on this very weak album: a real teenage boy and girl pleaser.Lesson: do not be a backstabbing ... and best not make high standards for yourself if you cannot compete with them."
4,WE'LL MISS YOU JAY-Z!!! ...,"This album should be in every single rap collection its so good (it could've been better) mt favs. song are ""What More Can I Say?"",""Change Clothes"",""Dirt Off Your Shoulder,""Lucifier"",""Moment Of Clarity"" (Very hot) the rest of it is aight but its still a very solid album its way better than ""Beg For Mercy"" and ""Blood In My Eye"" cuz people are most likely to compare these albums 2gether but this ALBUM IS GOOD GO PICK IT UP ITS THE ROC!!! ... JAY-Z ONE OF THE BEST IN THE GAME AND WE'LL MISS YOU HOVA!!! ..."
3,Good... Not Great... Not a Classic... Could do without it,"This CD has some good tracks, some Amazing ones, and some boring ones. In my opinion, the boring ones outweighed the rest. I love the song Lucifer. That's Jay-z's best song ever, thanks to Kanye. Dirt Off Your Shoulder is good too. Encore is good, and the ebst single on the Album. This album is good or okay. It is definately not a classic."
4,The Black Album,"hey whats up, i listened to this cd and I liked it, i know you all have probalby heard about that jay-z and linkin park cd, where they switched up the beats. And you all have probalby already heard about The Grey Album where a dj named Danger Mouse took the vocals of jay-z's Black Album and put them with the beats of the Beatle's White Albums, well i just wanted to let all you fans that you can download the grey album from http://www.illegal-art.org/audio/grey.html and it is legit to."
4,A F***ing Mazing,"Though this album had alot of hype, I think it's all worth it. I was feeling this album from the first song i listened to. I love Jay-Z, and i wish this wasn't his ""last"" album. All in all i dig this album big time!"
3,Alrite......,"This album is o.k. As its the last album of the jiggas man's career, you'd expect the best album of the century. This just surpasses the standard. It's just mediocre..,,,,"
2,"Production is lacking, too","In my previous review, I forgot to mention that the recording engineer must have been on something, cuz several of the tracks have very obvious clipping.Also, I thought there were a couple of okay tracks, musically. It's just that most of them really sucked."
3,Needs some time off.,"I didn't like Jay-z till he came out with Vol.3, I really liked him when the blueprint came out. Change Clothes is a great song but, I'm getting tired of hearing people using the Neptunes sound is getting played out. Oh well."
5,Classic.....Jay's best work,"This album is one of the top hip hop albums ever created....it is very creative and unique. The beats are great and the Lyrics represent Jay at his best. His flow really shines through on this disc, especially on ""Dirt off your shoulder"" (one of Timbo's best beats), ""what more can i say ?"" (my favorite Jay song) and ""December 4""....every song is great and has a very original theme, like the rock influenced ""99 problems"" where jay goes old school with a clever story over a rick rubin beat....go get this album, you'll love it. it is GREAT !!!!I've been reading all these revies and it sounds like the idiots who hate this album are blinded by the single and rate this album based on the Neptunes song....the album is great."
5,another one of them classics,its plain and simple Jay-z is one of the greatest rappers alive.I dont see how people dont like him.He is the meaning of a true mc.
1,So exactly how old is too old?,"This album sux major ? JZ is part of a group of old men who just look pathetic, and don't know when to call it quits. Hip hop is complete garbage now. Gone are the days when hip-hop(RAP) actually meant something, and not about how I'm better than you because I have more diamond rings. Hiphop is so mainstream now, that you have soccer moms blasting it out of their suv's. Wow, really cool.Screw Dr. Dre, Snoop, JZ and especially that complete has been, ICE CUBE. BTW none of them can act. I mean c'mon really, is it really a stretch for eminem to play himself? Screw these hip-hop-george-bush loving morons.El"
1,Jay -Z is as whack as it gets,"I have no idea why people even listen to this sorry excuse for an emcee. He has no skill, talent, and is far from original. I place this guy in the same catergory as the Insane Clown Posse. I think he never should've got a record deal in the first place. When you sample hooks from a kids movie you have no imagination. I personally hope this is his last album. I will never purchase any garbage by this no talent assclown."
1,It was time to retire Jay-Z,The Black Album should be called the Wack Album. I was never a real Jay-Z fan until the Blueprint. That album is a classic. he should have retired then if he wanted to retire on top. His last 2 album has not reach The Blueprint plateau. He is not the greatest rapper of all-time. That is Tupac. He need to stop telling them lies. i will not waste my money buying the album bootleg.
2,The Guy who could have been Good,"Well this is the way it has been ever since after Jay Z's classic album Reasonable Doubt. A bunch of empty fluff lyrics recited over well produced tracks. If you want to dance then this album is cool, but if you want lyrical content go somewhere else. The track ""Lucifer"" was an exception, dosen't even sound like the same guy responsible for garbage like ""Dirt on your Shoulder"" wrote that. The track ""Threat"" was also ok. I'm going to give it two stars;One for the production, and one for the track ""Lucifer""."
4,Jay-Z ends on high note,"If this truely is Jays last album he leaves at the top. The beats on this are all tight (prolly cuz there all by different producers) Eminem's ""Moment of Clarity"" & Timbaland's ""Dirt Off Your Shoulder"" are the standout tracks. This is not as good as Blueprint, but it is still a great album that leaves no doubt that Jay will be missed."
4,"*Great CD! Still Can't Compare To Blueprint ,Though*","This is a great CD! one of jay z's best, but still not better than The Blueprint 1 or 2. Jay Z hasnt lost his touch, hes just getting older. but i STILL cant get over the fact that hes retiring!! i will miss him so much. hes had such a great impact on rap music, and i cant imagine music without him! anyways, this was a great CD to retire on, one of jay z's masterpieces, but still not the same as the good old days. heres a few of my favorite tracks:*Dirt Off Your Shoulder (best song on album!!)-a sexy dance song with great beat!*99 Problems-it took me a while to get used to the different vibe, but its an awesome song!*Justify My Thug-this is a trippy song!!*December 4th-great song!!*Change Clothes-WAY overplayed but still great Neptunes song!WE WILL MISS YOU JAY Z!!!"
3,better than blueprint 2 but not jays best,"(...)By the way all metal is about is death n destruction made up relationships n devil worship songs. (...) rap is fo real but not so much today. (...)now about the albumGood: some very good trax like lucifer or dirt off your shoulder where Jigga really tries.Bad: terrible commercial pointless songs like change clothes.Plus he calls himself the best rapper alive? (...)improvements: alot more good songs less comercial [nonsence]Overall this album is worth buyin if your lookin for more from jay z but i suggest to buy his albums in this order: reasonable doubt, Vol. 2 hard knock life, vol. 3 life n times of s carter, the black album, vol. 1 in my lifetime, blueprint 1, Roc la familia, blueprint 2, Best of both worlds.Please dont buy the last 2 unless youd buy a (...)jay z(...). Peace."
4,Jay's Final?,"Listen this ""last"" album goes right up there with Vol.2 and The Gift and the Curse. But it is not a “Life after death” (even though Jay compares himself to BIG in every album from day one). There are some hot tracks though. ""Dirt Off Your Shoulder"" is another beat that reiterates Tim's level in producing. Eminem produces a track, ""Moment Of Clarity"" which is also tight. Then there is the track produced by Kanye West, which by far proves ""Lucifer"" the best beat on this album. I just wish S. Carter flowed a little bit more here. The rest of the tracks are ok but the above tracks are the only ones worth bootleggin. :)"
3,NOT IMPRESSED,"First of all i wanna say,I think Jay z,was the hottest thing to enter this rap games since sliced bread,(OK NOW FOR THE GOOD STUFF)but if this is his going out album.Then i am not impresses at all,I mean dont get me wrong the album is cool,but for this to be the last album to put out.It's supposed to go out with a bang damn ner be a classic,and this album is not that.This album is not even better then the Blue Print 2,And i thought that was the best album since In My Life Time Vol.3(note-I hated the first Blue Print too)Bottom line the album is not good enough to be his last album,and i think he could of came harder"
4,not as great but better than his prvious lp,"Jay Z really seemed like he was tryin 2 get better artists to appear on this album. He tried to get Prince to feature in a song (which one unknown) and Madonna to appear on ""Justify My Thug"" (a nice track that at least didnt repeat the original beat).""December 4th"" is pure classic, this song really stands out and gives chills. His mother speaks (a la ""She's Alive - Andre 3000) over the track as he trades rhymes, and the production of this track is outstanding. It is a surprise though that Timbaland's and Eminem's tracks are amoung the weakest productions on the lp.Threats feature sum crazed maniac makin threats 2 u as Jay Z rhymes fluently, also a nice track. ""Encore"" is very dope very dope.""Change Clothes"" is very very nice. The 1st single. Although their 2nd production on the album is mediocore ""allure""jay Z didnt wish 2 conquer success over ""The Blueprint"" but leaves with the eye wondering, will we miss him when he's gone 4 good? Only time will tell..."
4,4.5 Stars,"This album is amazing, thank you Jay for everything that you've given us in all these years. This album rivals any album jay has ever put out, it's a must have..."
3,"hell no, it's not Jigga's Best album",I won all his albums so I should know...Skits not included 12 songs...2. December 4th (3/5)3. What More Can I Say (3/5)4. Encore (4/5)5. Change Clothes (2.5/5)6. Dirt Off Your Shoulder (2/5)7. Threat Listen Listen (4/5)8. Moment Of Clarity (3.5/5)9. 99 Problems Liste(4.5/5)11. Justify My Thug (3/5)12. Lucifer (3.5/5)13. Allure (3/5)14. My 1st Song (3/5)My least favorite Jay-Z album (not counting R Kelly collabos) the next album will be better!(do you honestly belive Jigga won't come back any minute now? Even Vannilla Ice and Hammer has done comebacks so why wouldn't he?)
5,Can't hate it can't break it,"Hot disc.Strong songs. But I don't know why it has the parental advisory logo,he just swears alot.Interlude- same as all the interludesDecember 4th- 10/10Whatmore can I say 10/10Encore 20/10Change clothes 10/10Dirt off your shoulder 20/10Moment of clairity 1000/1099 problems 1000/10Public service annnouncement 100/10Justify my thug 100/10Lucifer 100000/10My first song 10000000/10"
4,to those who picked one star,"As i was reading some of these reviews i couldnt help but notice that the people who picked one star also did not like rap or hip hop culture. If you dont like the music, no one cares to know, just go ahead and rate your favorite genres and leave others alone. And for all those white, asian, hispanic people who do enjoy rap and the hip hop culture, more power to you! Because the music isnt for a race of people it is for all people. Sometimes rap is raw and harsh, sometimes its uplifting, sometimes its about everyday things and sometimes its about extrodinary things, but no matter what rap is telling you, recognize, it is a poetic art form with a beat. For those who picked one star, they fell into the stereotypes, and probably never heard of the underground. oh yeah, and by the way, the cd is worth buying."
5,"The Black Album , THE BEST ALBUM EVER ???","Instant Classic. I love this CD too bad that this is his last , We will miss you jay!!!!!!!"
1,If you dont like rap dont review it.,"Im tired of idiots coming here and reviewing this album becuase they hate rap. Well thats great, go tell someone who cares that you dont like rap. Im not saying this is a good album at all but back off non-rap fans and go rate your metal cds or watever. Im not a fan of country music but it doesnt mean i go over and rate country music albums. So go away, and leave rap fans to review the music they actually understand."
2,Very disapointed,"So sad that no only is this Jay-Z's last album but that he left us like this! We all know that nothing can beat Reasonable Doubt, that's a given, but give us something?? I also hope that he comes back to return with another classic, if not I'm not mad at him because he already gave us so many."
3,MOOSSSSSSSSTTTTTT OVERATED CD EEEEEVVVVVVEEERRRRRRRR,"wow this is Album is so overrated Change Clothes - garbage, dirt off your shoulders-I'm lost with that one and there's other tracks that i disliked but yo it's better than Vol. 3 but it should've been better than Reasonable Doubt Everybody Loves this CD why"
4,Not a bad way to end,"This is a good album made by the Jigga Man. It is sad that Jay had to go too, there isn't to many other good rappers that are in the rap game that are good as Jay-Z. But don't think it is the end of Jay-Z. album wise maybe yes but other wise no."
2,By Far The Worst CD Jay-Z has ever had his name on,"This is by far the worse CD ever put out by Jay-Z. The beats are weak, His flows sound like a stuttering child when you catch them doing something and they don't know what to say. I can't believe he let this CD get out in the open. I hope to god he realizes this and puts out one more CD before his retirement or else I will be really disappointed."
1,JAY-Z's Last Album?.........I See Why,"YES, YES, and YES....I wont able to hear from thiz big lip fool rap again....Yall people are brainwashed by thiz boooorrrriiinnnggg whack rapper name jay-z....Yall should listen to undaground muzik that was made in tha 90-99....listen to 2pac,he can rap...listen to sum crunk sh*t like 3-6 mafia or tommy wright III.....jay-z, that slow so call rappin big lip fool iz BORING BORING and WHACK....People and rap suck nowadayz"
1,I REALLY HOPE HE RETIRES AFTER THIS WEAK CD.,"I hope he retires for good this time because I am getting tired of looking at his ugly face and weak music.This cd is really weak and pathetic because it sounds boring just like all the rest of his albums.The music is very pop accompanied by weak beats and weak rapping.He raps about the same thing that all rappers rap about money,clothes,cars,hoes.All in all I hope he stays retired because he is one weak rapper.DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE!!!"
2,The Black album: One of the best Hip hop albums in a while!!,The best Jigga Album yet!! After this one maybe Roc La familia Album. N.Y.C Stand up !!! Bx 1luv!!
2,was a good rapper,"i think jay z is a good rapper when he wants to be butnot on the bp2 nor the black album,no disrespect but after thenas fued jay hasn't made any good albums,he has made some good tracks in his time but he can't always stay on top.he wants to be like mike jordan but he's realy like mike tysonfarewell jay you were one of the best but you can only talk aboutthe same stuff for so long,what you should have studied was the art of diverstty so you can make universal music about all types of topics instead of money clothes and women wich gets old after a while like nas said how can you tease people with platinum, cars and money that may never own a piece of platinum in theirlife it means you say things that your listners realy can't relate to farewell ."
2,I don't understand!!!,"I don't really don't understand why all the people say that this album is good; well, i cant deny that it has impresive lyrics but nothing more, Damn i really glad that this is the last album of this punk, NAS RULESSS!!!!"
1,highly recommended not to buy this catastrophe!,Jay aint done anything great on this album to many it may seem that he is some legendary rapper but this is not true at all he is actually very ordinary and mediocre at best he is highly overated cause the truth is most the rappers nowdays suck so even if he sucks extremely hard he is still great so whatever go ahead and throw your money in the dustbin!
1,Another Black Album???,"I guess J-Z stole the title directly from Prince's ""Black Album"" from the early 90's, which was a take-off on the Beatles ""White Album"" from the late 60's or early 70's, and then there were the black albums by Metallica, and of course Spinal Tap... But hey, everyone needs to get inspiration from somewhere, right? So here is some advise about making records: Next time around, come up with an original title, ok Jay-Z? I'm so tired of current celebs ripping off older musicians and not giving them their due credit and respect. It's very overplayed....."
1,Rap is for morons& this cd proves it!,"Well i heard this on the cd store because i wil never buy no rap album in my life! Anyways, i heard it and try to be fair but i just cant get into it! The beats are annoying and the lirycs are hard to understand specialy the slangs! If you want a black vocalist that has something to say listing to godforbid! All you guys that like rap music go in the store and ask for godforbid okay ? You'll hear how real music sounds like and leave crap alone ooops i mean rap! ""peace homies"" ha!"
1,jigga,"hova, hola. where have u been lately. i missed jay z.hiz first cd wus real gehtoo.rasonable doubt wuz his best. hard nock life wuz also ghetoo. but life a timez wit big pimpin stunk. i liked da next 1 kinda cept it had memphis bleek da horrible mc. i hate him enoff said bout him. blueprint 1 roked. blueprint 2 stunk. blueprint 2.1 was da worst cd eva. now da blak album is not da worst cd eva but its hovaz hollas worst. i though dis would be his closin career. g unitz cd i think might be better.here ill rate jay z cds 1.r.s. 2.hiz fist 3.h.n.l. 4.blueprint 5.life and timez.... 6.da black albuM 7.blueprint 2 gift n kurse 8.blueprint 2.1 hova holla, dont make no more memphis bleek stuff that mc is wack aiight ill still listen 2 hovas old cdz cept for his bad ones bye bye."
1,Jay Z Sucks,"This is the worst album of this short decade. Jay Z was never any good, BDK did the world a great disservice by trotting this clown out on stage to open for him long ago. Can't understand why so many people think his music is any good--Good riddance. Let someone with some real talent make a few bucks."
2,"Not bad, but not great",I've only heard a few tracks off it and it seems moderate for a final CD (unless Jigga comes out with anotha one down the road) the title obviously ain't original. But I actually thought the Grey album from him was better.
3,The Black Album :/,"Wow... umm... let's just say that the lyrics are... not-so-good. It's complete nonsense, and anybody who says that the album is well-written must be on something. If you go look up the lyrics to ""Change Clothes"" you will probably find yourself in a state of utter confusion, as I was. Really, it's not that I have anything against Jay-Z, it's just that he needs some new songwriting techniques. If you're a fan of nonsensical rap, then this is good for you. If you prefer lyrics that actually make some sense, I'd suggest something else."
1,thank god,"Finally, after all these years jay-z is gonna finally be gone. I think he has been one of the worst rappers ever. His flow is horrible, he steals many peoples lyrics especially Biggie and he is responsible for recruiting some of the worst commercial rappers ever. How are you gonna make a song about how ur a gangster and then make a song about modles wearing cloths, this guy was the biggest joke ever, at least it will be one less fake commercial rapper to worry about."
1,Absolute 0 is better,Possibly betwwen Jay z and p diddy it is hard to pick who I hate the most so I just put them in a tie. This is Gay zs last album so I say good riddance to bad rubbish. HOW CAN PEOPLE GIVE THIS ALBUM A 5 STAR ARE YOU GUYS DEAF OR RETARDED TO SEE HE HAS NO SKILL WHAT SO EVER. Admit it if Pac and Biggie were alive this man would have no career cuz they would eat em up alive and spit him out. I feel since his first album he went downhill and it is great that it is all over and hopefully he'll just fade away into oblivium.PS Best rapper alve? B*&^h please.
1,Jay-Z is getting old and through,"Thanks Jay-Z for making this your last CD. I didn't pay that much money to hear you introduce yourself 10000 times and talk about how good your doing another 10000 times. I bought your CD and it was redundant and boring. There aren't any motivating songs that make me want to move.Only #11 is good because he doesn't talk about himself. THANKS!!!I know your name is Jay-Z and i know you made some money, OKAY prove to us why you got to where you are!!!!!!!!!! and stop reminding us of what we already know.If i buy a CD called JAY Z , then i know your name is JAY Z ,ARE YOU RUNNING OUT OF RHYMES??????"
4,Great Album to Great Rapper,"This album is hot. The songs are off the hook, like ""Moment of Clarity"" ft. Eminem. That song is hot, and so is ""Dirt Off Your Shoulder"". You gotta get this album if you don't have it. In my opinion, Reasonable Doubt is Jay-Z's best album. You know what, cop both of these albums."
4,"Sadly, Jay-Z's Last Album","Jay-Z is a great rapper and always would be, but this is his last album, the Black Album. The title spoofs on the Beatle's album, the White Album. This features the hit, Change Clothes. This is a great track and features one of the best producers ever, Pharrel, from the Neptunes. This isn't Jay-Z's best track but still one of the better. Jay-Z has collaborated with Pharrel many times like, Excuse Me Miss, the single off The Blueprint 2.0. Jay-Z will continue to produce and collaborate on albums, but will not make anymore of his own. This isn't one of Jay-Z's best albums, but a great one. I still request it to all rap and Jay-Z fans."
1,Garbage!,"Garbage! Every once in a while, you purchase a martial arts movie & after 10 minutes, your asking yourself why did they make this movie or why would Amazon or any other retailer stock or sell this movie when it is Garbage! New school style martial arts movie that needs to be labled as so...I am into the oldschool style movies!"
3,Would have been 5 stars except for three problems.,Baedecker's is an old name in the travel guide world. I reallylove my Baedecker's Turkey except for two minor and one major problem.The first minor problem is that Pisidia Antiocha is not metioned in the book. I was hurt by this as it is near my home and this region of Turkey is quite proud of it. The second minor problem is the map that comes with the book is too large and cumbersome for use while driving. The major problem is the binding. After just two years of sparse usage the binding is completely wrecked. I love the book so now I will have to shell out the money to have it bound but since I already paid ... for it I think the binding should have lasted longer.
5,absolutely delicious!,I just had my birthday party a few days ago wich had the South-American/Spanish theme. So I had bought the record for the right atmosphere. Everybody kept on asking me what CD I had on because it was so great. The party was a hit and so is the CD. I have also seen the movie(about a hondred times) and I can't think of a better memorabilia!
5,Sensational and Upbeat!,"I absolutely loved The Mask of Zorro! I bought it as soon as it came to home video. However, I waited longer on buying the soundtrack. I think the music in the movie is amazing. James Horner did an excellent job, and also with the love theme. The only problem is the vocals in ""I Want to Spend My Lifetime Loving You"". I thought Marc Antony and Tina Arena were good, but he could have picked some better people. Like, maybe, Shania Twain? Maybe some people America is more familiar with."
5,Bravo! Encore! Encore!,"First of all I must say that ""The Mask of Zorro"" is the second best movie I have ever seen in my entire life! I loved it! My friends and I have already seen it three times and hope to go back for a forth. I just couldn't resist getting the soundtrack. When I bought it, the first thing I listened to was ""The Fencing Lesson"". That was one of my favorite scenes. Ever since then the only CD I ever listen to is ""Zorro"". It is fun and exciting, but still sweet and romantic. I never really payed the character, ""Zorro"" much attention until I saw the movie. It completely changed my mind. I was just a little disappointed that it didn't have the ""Tango"" music on it. I recomend that you see the movie and buy the soundtrack. They are both amazing."
2,"Can't relax during this CD. Bang, whimper. Loud, soft.","This CD was a disappointment. I really liked the movie, but listening to the CD was a study in irritation. Each piece is a mixture of loud bangs and soft whimpers. Just try to relax, and BANG. Try to get invigorated, and it gets mushy and soft. I wish Horner would keep all the loud music together and not destroy the somber or relaxing songs with all that bashing about. For all the talk of flamengo, there is not one piece that is authentic. Well, my kids like the CD so I am presenting it to one of them as a gift."
1,Horner cuts and pastes AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The man is a FRAUD! In every soundtrack that James Horner ""composes"" elements of every other score he has done can be heard, repeatedly. This was simply Braveheart vol. 3, Titanic being vol. 2. I have visions of Horner at home on his computer cutting and pasting his scores to his new films and changing the instruments for new textures. For a man who blantantly steals from himself and others he pushes the line of influence and crosses into abuse. His music gets in the way of watching the movie. His last James Horner Original Soundtrack was in 1992 for Sneakers, which Kenny G has been doing since 1986. But the illustrious composer manages to fool the public again."
3,I can't give it 2and a half,It's for the movie and isn't good on it's own. But there are some great bits when all the noise stops.
2,Junior-League El Cid Meets RiverDance,"Clearing away the hype, this score is admittedly a smooth and pleasant backdrop. The orchestration, long-lined melodic writing, and performance are all superficially a good imitation of traditional romantic scoring. Of course the whole thing is totally impersonal and devoid of a point of view about the film, the characters, the drama, anything, but that's probably why Horner's popularity as the generic soundtrack specialist continues-- film music as designer wallpaper. Mask of Zorro mines the same Spanish folk influences as Rozsa in El Cid so the criticism of the similarities are unfair, but what about the other material leaning on Goldsmith's The Edge, a score from less than one year previous? The cute River Dance touches seem really commercial and for fans of Horner that can only mean great. First rate hair gel from the oscar-winning stylist."
5,Great Music to March to,"This soundtrack is so cool! I play it every day in band because our competition show is the soundtrack to ""The Mask of Zorro"" It is a powerful soundtrack and it sounds pretty good. Let me rephrase that-it sounds really good!! I also love ""I Want to Spend My Lifetime Loving You."" The songs are not boring like some people have said. It is moving and fast sometimes. Sure, there are slow songs, but they really move you. We did not get the movie right when it came out but when we heard that our competition show was going to be ""The Mask of Zorro,"" we got it. I love this soundtrack and if you are still thinking on buying it, you should. It is the coolest soundtrack ever-as good as Star Wars. Maybe even better-you decide."
3,"Decent CD, but be warned!","I guess it's a pretty good score, but my appreciation was dulled by my disappointment at the fact that the one track I really wanted was not on the CD. The song that plays during Alejandro and Elena's ""spirited"" dance is not here, as I came to realize. It actually isn't even an official part of the score, I think now, but boy did I want it to be on here."
4,something's missing,"It is always such a disappointment when you buy a soundtrack and find out that the song/music you most liked in the movie is not included in the OST.I bought this CD mainly because I simply found the music which Antonio Banderas and Catherine Zeta-Jones danced to in the movie quite irresistible. I don't know what instrument was used but it sounded like a violin, and it was amazing, sounding both passionate and romantic at the same time. So I was really disappointed when I listened to the CD and didn't hear it. Other than that however, I have no other complaints."
4,Very good Horner Soundtrack,"This soundtrack is as good as the Titanic soundtrack. Maybe it's even better. Tracks 3 and 6 begin with a lot action and I like that yes. If you like Titanic, you like The mask of Zorro!"
2,2 Stars for 2 Good Songs,"Most people might disagree with me about this review. But I'm the person who want the music to be loud and agressive ( If you want to know what I'm talking about listen to MINORITY REPORT, SIGNS, DANTE'S PEAK, HARRY POTTER AND THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS, JURASSIC PARK 1 AND 2).Song number one is really cool due to the begining and the fight scene in the plaza. The Ride is the coolest song with a secondary theme from the movie playing in the backround. It has great action and suspense. The rest of the music was romatic in a way. So I give the soundtrack 2 stars."
3,"I loved ""I Want To Spend My Lifetime Loving You""",Most of the Cd was good but the best was saved for last. The last song is great! You've gotta get this soundtrack if not just for this song.
2,Not altogether correct........,"I hate to write bad reviews, but this book is not correct in its explanation of the release of the Holy Spirit...the book is directed to the 'carnal Christian' who wants to 'fast food Christianity'.....I would NOT recommend this book to anyone seeking the Holy Spirit...if you are seeking the Holy Spirit, simply read the Scriptures...and focus your heart,mind,body and soul on Jesus Christ....after that the Gifts of the Spirit will flow out effortlessly..."
5,FOR ANYONE WHO DESIRES THE BAPTISM IN THE HOLY SPIRIT,"I read this book in one evening and received the Baptism in the Holy Spirit as soon as I put the book down. This is a must read for anyone seeking the Baptism in the Holy Spirit. Also a great teaching aid in helping others receive ""release"". Easy to read, and very down to earth. A must for every Pastors library."
2,Interesting But Hazey,"There is supposed to be a loose concept here about multiple personalities, but you'll be hard pressed to find it. ""dada"" is Alice having another nightmare, but this one, while a touch better than ""Zipper Catches Skin,"" still lacks coherency in the writing and performing. The main standout is ""I Love America,"" the most Alice Cooperish of the songs included.""Former Lee Warner"" and ""Pass The Gun Around"" hold up to the quirky new wave feel that first exposed itself on ""Flush The Fashion,"" but after that it's rough going for anyone but the diehards. You can just say Nada to ""dada."""
5,Surprisngly awesome.,"I've been a casual fan of Alice Cooper's since the early/mid '80's. I've had some of his more well known albums on cassette for years, and have heard pretty much all of his albums someway or another. Except this one. I recently went hog-wild and bought all 22 Alice Cooper studio albums that I did not have, and this one surprised me more than any of them. For one, you hardly ever hear this album mentioned at all, which made me think it wasn't good. Also, I saw that no drums were on the album, that most of the percussion was done with a computer, I immediately thought it would suck. Man, was I wrong! This is one of the best Cooper albums out there. Full of his twisted lyrics, but also sentimental and touching ones as well. The album literally blew me away, and I recommend it to any of Alice's fans who haven;t took the plunge yet."
4,"Creepy, in a tonge-in-cheek kindda way...","This lost gem of the early 80's has some of Alice's most strange songs of his career, both in lyrics and sounds. Any Alice fan, or at least people who enjoy songs like ""Steven"", ""Only Woman Bleed"" or the ""Last Temptation"" albumn, should hear the creepy ""Former Lee Warmer"", the intro, or the wonderful ballad ""Pass the gun around"". Alice says he doesn't remember recording Da Da and probably will never play any of this songs live, but that shouldn't keep us from checking them out. It should've been strange hearing this in the ""Footlose"" year..."
3,Good but not his best,"Anyone else notice the subliminal optical illusion in the artwork on the front cover of this album? If you look/stare at it closely enough, you`ll notice that the artwork is actually a picture of a face. Alice`s 2 heads in the artwork are the eyes of the face and the white bit on the bottom left corner is the person`s shoulder."
4,The Alice we all know,"This album starts off with a great, creepy reminder of why I am an Alice Cooper fan. The father voice talking to the child gives me chills every time I hear it. Another superb release by Alice Cooper."
3,Very '80's,"Dada is a fun album but a little strange. Well what Alice Cooper album isn't, right? This one is a little different in that he experiments with computer generated drum sounds and doesn't use much real percussion at all. I think that any of these songs would sound at place on the ""TOP GUN"" soundtrack because it sounds very '80's to me. Of course it still has Alice Coopers's little touch of psychotic flair and sense of humor. This is a good ablum and very entertaining. Alice Cooper fans should love it even if it is a little different than some of his classic albums."
3,Cooper at his most twisted yet.,"This CD is probably one of Cooper's most twisted albums from the 80's. Songs like ""Former Lee Warmer"", ""No Man's Land"", and ""Pass the Gun Around"" are very enertaining in an offbeat sort of way. Not for all of his fans, but definetly worth finding."
2,sheets were disappointing,"Although I couldn't see clearly what exactly was on the sheets, they are called ""Packer sheets"". Yea, there is nothing Packer on them. At all. They are just plain white NFL and a football on them, also in white. I could've just bought plain white sheets! My son was very disappointed, as he was looking forward to his Packer sheets. The pillowcase is nice though, but that's all."
3,For black metal fans only,"i personally dislike this music, not because of the lyrics,image but the simplistic, lack of talent guitar noise and vocals that sound like a drowning cat. ill rather stick to death and thrash metal. though i have to admit that this album is certainly one of the best in the black metal scene."
4,mmmmm,"i REALLY recommend that you buy this cd. favourite track has to be To Walk The Infernal Fields. If you want to listen to the definition of black metal, this is it. more atmospheric than melodic, the sound quality is rough, yet fits perfectly. sounds like its shredding your ear drums apart :) its all great."
5,good fit,"The price was right and the product arrove way before my expectation. Usually purchased the 42B, this 42A was an experiment that worked."
5,COOL!,"Being an excellent cook myself, I read cookbooks more for ideas than anything else. This book not only gave me lots of ideas, it brought back memories of my Grandmother's cooking. Also, it wasn't filled with a lot of endless, useless, chatter.This book has incredible graphics - 50's style. I've stood it up on my counter and everyone who comes over says, ""Patio DaddyO!"" Unfortunately, it hasn't inspired my husband to take over the tongs. Ah well. This makes a great gift for any BBQ'er or yourself - especially if you're into the late 50's/ early 60's style of anything. Worth the low price and more."
4,"A Very Clever, Refreshing and Surprising Satirical Comedy!","I watched David's Mamet's ""State and Main"" for the first time the other day and I must say I was pleasantly surprised. Casting Phillip Seymour Hoffman as the leading man in this story was a stroke of brilliance. Hoffman brings that refreshing regular guy attitude to his role. Rebecca Pidgeon, David Paymer, William H.Macy, Alec Baldwin, Charles Durning, Sarah Jessica Parker, Julia Stiles and Jonathon Katz join Hoffman in the ensemble cast. Mamet's script and direction make this Hollywood satire a very enjoyable two hours. For anybody who has not seen this movie, it is highly recommended. Pidgeon, also Mamet's wife, is the shining light as the likable book store owner."
2,More like 2 1/2 stars,"Well, this movie is worth seeing if there isn't anything better to see at the time. ""Annie"" has a GREAT performance, she can very well portray a small towner, and she is a good example of people who ""make their own fun"". It's an OK movie overall, but the last 5 min of the movie are worth seeing, so you might as well watch it for those 5 min."
3,"Irritating, Yet Funny","Perhaps I watched this movie at the wrong time in my life. I may never know. But I have oddly mixed feelings about 'State and Main'. The first bits of the movie are hilarious, pure gold, but now I'm thinking that it's only because of the fresh and unique way in which the story is written and directed. Plus the great acting. After the initial ""Wow, this is something different!"", however, the movie gets predictable and tedious. And almost irritating. All I can in it's defense is this: the acting is superb. Julia Stiles is a gem, William H. Macy makes this movie, and Alec Baldwin and Sarah Jessica Parker are very good as the spoiled, immature movie stars. Besides that, the movie is an odd combination of ""Good, Unique, and Refreshing"" and ""Bad, Predictable, and Irritating""."
2,"Can you say ""Over-rated""?","Lots of snappy dialog. Lots of recognizable actors. Lots of... blah blah blah.I wanted to like it, but just like the Hollywood it parodies, it's pretentious. It has its humourous moments but ultimately... I just don't get the hype. Maybe the actors read Mamet's scripts and get all excited about doing his films because the staccato dialog seems so good to them on paper. To me, watching his films is like watching a stage play where the actors have to exaggerate to better get the meaning accross to the audience. I see a film to watch the story like a fly on the wall. Like a real event with an invisible watcher. Oh well, maybe it's just me."
1,"Toothpicks for your eyes, a stake for your heart!","This movie was about as much fun as watching paint dry. Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Alec Baldwin, and Sarah Jessica Parker were wasted in this movie. I was looking so forward to seeing ""State and Main"", but both my husband and I were sorely disappointed. The pacing was terrible and it plays like an inside joke that only people in the film industry will understand. Every tidbit worth viewing was in the trailer. If you're looking for a movie about a small town w/ eccentric locals, buy ""Nobody's Fool"". It's far more entertaining than this rubbish, even if it doesn't have a thing to do with movie making on location."
1,Not even a 1!,"Very pretentious look at how film people behave when doing their thing. There are far better examples out there (Day for Night comes to mind). The movie would have been barely passable thanks to the presence of William H. Macy (always great) or Sarah Jessica Parker (playing the role of a bad actress very, very well). However, the insufferable dialogue between Rebecca Pidgeon and Philip Hoffman ruins the movie. I could not get over how affected these characters were. Do people REALLY talk to each other that way? This movie gets a zero in my book."
5,I couldn't stop laughing,"There are some many good things about this movie that it's hard to pick some out. Phillip Seymour Hoffman is brilliant as playwright/screenwriter Joseph Turner White. You can not say enough about his performance ""Have you seen my typewriter?"" And when he is about to sit on the porch with his woman, the conversation that takes place is classic. And then there is Alec Baldwin the pedophile, ""So that happened."" We can't forget William H Macy's character who gives a giant loaf of bread as a gift. I can't praise this movie enough, it is one of all time favorite movies. ""Go you Huskies!"""
3,Hollywood Filmmaking Up Close With Acerbic Twist,"The fictitious town of Waterford, Vermont is the backdrop for ""State and Main,"" David Mamet's witty, acerbic look at Hollywood filmmaking. Or as one character puts it ""showbiz hell."" It's all here: contractually obligated starlets forced to pose nude because of script obligations; the obsessed screenwriter; the oversexed male lead with an eye for pretty tennaged girls; the frazzled director forced to suck up to everyone just to have the movie made; the starstuck locals angling for a 10-second cameo; and all those endless rewrites that pop up just minutes before the camera rolls. Thoughout the film, it's obvious Mamet knows the lingo, the genre, the attitude, the inside scoop. But unless the viewer is up on Hollywood (and I mean up), he or she may be lost. I, in turn, had a ball."
4,Mainly Funny,"Phillip Hoffman is searching for purity. Unfortunately his play has been purchased by a wild Hollywood movie crew, and they are off and shooting in Waterford, Vermont because Main Street is already there. It is cheaper than building a set. Then the town folks, New Englanders, dry and pragmatic, mingle with Hollywood slime balls, daft, smooth-talking director, William H. Macy and screen idol, young girl chasing, Alex Baldwin. Sarah J. Parker of Sex in the City fame plays the nymphomaniac actress bedding everyone in sight. Small town smart girl Rebecca Pigeon and writer Hoffman make the necessary changes in the script and then they fall in love. A scandal threatens the shoot and somebody forgets the mayor's dinner party. There is plenty of manic fun here. I recommend for a good laugh. Also, is it just me or is William H. Macy the best actor in the world."
5,That's Entertainment.,"My sister saw this film and hated it, probably because she has nothing to do with the entertainment industry and just did not ""get it"". ""State and Main"" brings you into behind the scenes Hollywood, and shows the viewer pre-production aspects of a film in the works. Very fascinating. I enjoyed the brilliant acting, the enchanting setting and the clever script, making this an all around good film. Alot of the material covered in this film borders on inside jokes of show business, so if you've never been on a set before, you just can't appreciate the humour. If your someone that has a love affair for the entertainment industry, this film is for you."
1,Unbelievably boring.,Not funny. Not interesting. Not clever. Not anything. I'm not even going to finish watching this dog before returning it to Blockbuster. A great cast...with nothing to do.
1,the absolute worst,"This movie makes me physically ill when I watch it...one of mamet's actors once said that Mamet's dialogue is a style of its own but when you're acting it out well it doesn't seem like a style it seems real...well the dialogue sure as hell seems like a style in state and main, and a frustrating style at that...this movie feels like a bunch of people in the real world speaking a language that is annoying and doesn't exist, or maybe i just can't understand it....regardless, after this and 'heist' i think it is safe to say that ole Dave should stick to writing play which he is brillaint at (i.e. American Buffalo, Glengarry Glen Ross and Speed the Plow.)....phillip seymour hoffman is the only saving grace in the film but he's pretty much brilliant in whatever he does.....don't waste your time with this one folks....it was filmed in my home town and i didn't even like it!!!!!"
1,This film is a tragedy,"My girlfriend brought this DVD over the other night to show me. Now, she is normally a very sweet girl, but I have reason to believe now that she may be smoking something.This film is plagued by poor acting, bad direction, and third-rate script-editing. Lines are cliched and forced, and characters are stereotypically two-dimensional. I'm normally very good at the suspension-of-disbelief, but this is beyond my abilities. Even the NAMES are contrived.State And Main attempts to recreate some of the real-scenario feel of other films, and their influence can be felt. I am reminded of Magnolia, Wag the Dog, and others. The difference is, I actually enjoyed watching these, unlike State and Main. Don't waste your time."
1,A painful letdown,"If Mamet doesn't pull out of his deathspiral soon, you'll soon be able to officially file him amongst Paul Auster, Eric Clapton, and a score of other dinosaurs who busted out of the gate with a seemingly endless reservoir of talent and then proceeded to give everyone a lesson on appearance versus reality. The story is certainly not the most exciting, but the acting is mostly at what's fault here. Or, let's be honest, it's the acting AND the directing. For someone who's MARRIED to the guy, Rebecca Pidgeon seems to not have the faintest clue of how to read a line written by her husband. To be fair, though, she's not the only one completely botching things up. Lines and entire plots just go clunk, clunk, clunk. Simply don't waste your time with this one, and revisit Mamet's first 4 or 5 movies, all winners by any standard."
1,For Mamet fans only!,"I couldn't get past the very stylized dialogue which seemed to coming from the same source although different actors were speaking. The characters are cliches through and through and does anyone really speak the way the people do? Mamet appears to have never left Manhattan and has no clue to writing non urban roles or a script with enough nuance to delineate his characters perspective. To be honest I didn't finish the entire film, but instead checked the TV Guide for reruns of Northern Exposure for the real thing."
1,Amateur night all the way around!,"I guess this is supposed to be a satire on Hollywood making a film in a small town, but it's more of a self-satire on Mamet's own very tired & overdone one-note schtick. This movie is lazily written & sloppily uneven, it goes all over the place from moment to moment, scene to scene. The acting (what there is of it, because as in most Mamet productions, there's a lot of postured readings instead of acting) is like something from a school play rehearsal. Poor Alec Baldwin is supposed to be a star but looks like a fat old villain out of a Chaplin movie. If this movie is supposed to be a put-down of the Hollywood system, it fails miserably. It makes one yearn for blockbuster special-effects. Should be rated NO STARS."
2,Not very good...,...But it gets one star for the brief moments that Ricky Jay has in the film and another for portions of Alec Baldwin's performance. Overall this is a stinker. Mamet is not a good director. He should stick to writing.
3,Hit&Miss,"Prince is one of those Artists that it is tough to Cover His material but Tina Turner,Stephanie Mills,Sinead O'Conner,Living Color,Sheena Easton&The Bangles step up to the material.the rest is just so/so to me."
3,Songbook Review,"Great things about this recording: 1- The Classic 80's cuts. Sugar Walls - Sheena Easton, Manic Monday - The Bangles. Melissa Morgan does a fairly good job with ""Do me Baby"", Stephanie Mills does well performing ""How come you don't Call Me"" . ""The Sex Of It is a great 80's style pop/funk/ dance track - if you haven't heard it your missin out. It was difficult to listen to Joe Crocker, Living Color and Cyndi Lauper perform 0+> work. Overall it's worth checking it out."
3,Roberta as heard in a 1950's nightclub,"This is a classic recording of the score which my family owned in various incarnations since the 1950's. That doesn't mean it is particularly good however. The cast in no way sounds as if they are actually performing the score before an audience. The orchestrations are those 1950-""Living-Strings-oh aren't we sophisticated"" type. They bare no relationship to the actual 1930's kind. Listen to the soundtrack of the 1930's movie if you can find it.The recording reminds me of something heard at a swank after hours night club in 1952, when a few top performers found the music for Roberta, and decided to have fun singing it. Unfortuately I believe it is the most complete recording now available, so it is the only game in town. We really need a restored version of the score badly."
3,a sluggish performance,"I am a huge fan of any of Kern's music, so I have owned this recording in several of its versions. The problem is, the whole score is conducted without any energy at tempi so slow that it must have been very difficult for the singers. They are all Broadway professionals, but the conductor leads such lackluster arrangements that there is no aura of theatricality. The Decca version, although briefer, and with rather an unsteady contribution from Kitty Carlisle, is decidedly preferable!"
1,Permanent filter is not-so-permanent,"The humidifier itself worked well. But, when it comes to the filter, don't let their add fool you. It is not permanent. Despite cleaning and care like they recommend, the filter grew mold. The replacement is almost the same price as the humidifier itself. Not worth it in the end!"
1,Did not even open the box when I brought it home,"I bought this unit thinking it would be a good humidifier. That it may be, but I could not find any place that sold the filter anywhere. That worried me some given the first review I had seen here. I appreciated the tip and decided that rather than take a chance I return it to the store. I ended up buying a different Bionaire that did not require a filter and it seems to work well. If the filters become available for this unit cheaply or reasonably then this one should be considered. Otherwise no way."
5,On Being a Therapist,This is a fantastic book for the beginning therapist and a reminder to those more experienced. It reviews the pitfalls and joys of working in the field and reminds us of why we're here and for whos benefit. Compassionately dealt with subject matter that reads well. A must read.
4,Best Textbook I've Purchased Yet,"Considering this book may not be meant as a supplement to a grad school textbook, this is why I purchased it. I have to say that it holds my interest more than any other ""textbook"" I've purchased, and I am very pleased with it. The author (Kottler) is down-to-earth, open, and honest about the ups and downs of the counseling profession. Sometimes, I felt he comes across a little negative and opinionated, but for the first time I found myself connecting to the author and everything he said, whether I agreed with it or not."
4,On Being a Therapist,An interesting book detailing how a therapist affects a client and how clients affect therapists. A must read for those considering going into the therapist profession.
5,Antidote to Cyberworld,"As a professional interior designer for 20 yrs., I've unknowingly shared many of Mr. Wheatman's principles. These design principles are important today but even more so as the technological world advances around us. Visions of sparse, sterile, synthetic environments that often are presented as homes of the future are not what human beings are about; we need to open ourselves to Mr. Wheatman's philosophies and seek to apply them in this new cyberworld. Bravo on a book well-written!"

1,Disappointing,"You would expect a movie like this to be much more interesting. Two renowned actors playing their seminal roles, meeting each other in an action movie reminiscent of the Clint Eastwood-Lee Van Cleef era. Instead, the movie is tedious, dwelling on a depressed and irascible Yojimbo and a character conflict that is more annoying than significant. When Yojimbo and Zatoichi square off against each other, it's hard to explain why they'd really want to -- it certainly isn't for bragging rights or honor or to ensure that the good guys win. The ultimate resolution of the story and discovery of the hidden treasure is somewhat interesting, I suppose, but hardly makes it worthwhile to sit through the length of the movie. The only real reason to see the movie is for the curiosity factor of catching Zatoichi and Yojimbo together. I understand there is one other movie that pairs the two of them -- perhaps it is more worth seeking out."
2,READ THIS!! This is what you looking for!!!!!!!!!!,"This Zatoichi movie is not THAT good.I'll tell you why:Good:* Good cinematoghraphy.* Cool snow scenes.* Cool short fight at the begining.* Thank god!! this movie cost 20$ instead of 30$.Bad:* Bad and short fight between Toshiro Mifune and Zatoichi!!* Zatoichi have to fight with his sword broken apart all the time.* There is a fight when Zatoichi use only his swordcane intead of his blade.* Zatoichi's movements were not that fast.* Most of the movie is blah,blah,blah and there is not much action!Adios!"
1,I couldn't tell I had taken anything,This did nothing for me at all! I would not recommend this product to anyone. It may work for some but for me it didn't work at all.
1,Beware!!!,Product messes up your hormone level/balance. I had the longest menstrual cycles ever (25 days)!!! I needed to see a gynecologist and be on a treatment before things fell back into place!
3,Not as powerful as tea,I use this product as a diuretic but it is not as effective as the tea. You have to take 3 caps twice a day with food (food will help the drug absorbe quickly) and so far I have not felt a thing. The tea is much quicker and you can feel effects faster.
4,It's definitely helping,"I have definitely found that this has helped me control the water in my body. I got myself on subscribe and save so I never have to miss taking it. The recommended dosage is 3 capsules, however I find that if I take 3, I feel off and somewhat nauseous. I take 2 capsules twice a day and it's working. Every month I would retain water weight to the tune of 1-2 lbs during that time. This month I only retained 0.2 lbs!! Woo hoo!"
3,Have not received the benefits as described,We all have different metabolisms so it was worth the try. You might have better luck than I thought I would have had.
3,I still don't know,"I started taking these capsules as an recommendation from the book ""Remedies for Acne: How to Diagnose and Dramatically Cure the Root Cause of Acne Forever."" I still don't know if it will help me with my acne, I will let you know."
2,Better Bets Out There,"Not a great value. I believe this works, but you have to take a lot of pills and run out quickly. Switch to the tea."
3,Make sure it is right for you!,"I think it's important to note it is more likely you may be allergic to this than other supplements. Here is part of the WebMD side effect warning: ""...People who are allergic to ragweed and related plants (daisies, chrysanthemums, marigolds) are likely to be allergic to dandelion. If you have allergies, be sure to check with your healthcare provider before taking dandelion.""Having seasonal allergies, and having taken this for 3 days, I unfortunately think I am one of those sensitive people so I can't comment on the effectiveness of this product as I have stopped using it. I can however note that sometimes when taking the pill there is a floral taste - a taste like you got too close to the flowers you were smelling. It's not bitter though and goes away within a few minutes."
5,Excellent product and quick delivery,Everything this product said is true and then some. I have Rheumatoid Arthritis and Ankylosing Spondalytis and it is critical what I take and not take. This product has truly helped me. And it gets along with my medications. Thank you.
5,Princess for a day,This was a birthday gift for my grand daughter Olivia. She owns all the books and loved this. Bought with one click. It came in plenty of time and was just what she wanted.
3,At Least I could help less fourtunate people,"I love the other Bridged's diaries, but this one.... I could just finish it at a book store. Not much significant. But it's okay. I still feel good to own this one since the part of the money goes to the less fortunate people."
4,For a good cause,"Not the funniest of Helen Fielding's works, but buying it gives money to feed starving people. Who can say no to that? Save lives, be amused, and you don't even have to leave your chair."
2,very disappointing,"This was not v.g. Very disappointing... even though some of the proceeds go to charity, this was still not worth it. Fielding could have been much more creative & innovative with this guide. Instead, the book is sloppy and rushed (too many typos), and simply not funny. She turns Bridget into much more of a silly caricature than she is in the first two Bridget Jones'."
3,"Great Value, A Little Broken Up","I was looking for a bulk price bargain on my preferred premium dog biscuit for my two Vizslas & this definitely met that criteria. Canidae's Snap Biscuits always have some bits and pieces in the bottom of the bag, which is understandable since the biscuit is a snap variety. I was afraid the larger quantity might mean more waste & I was right. There were three (3) plastic 4# bags in a large single cardboard box to comprise the 12#, so they must shuffle a bit & in the end the amount of tiny bits & powdery crumbs in the bottom of each bag was a significant amount of waste. Though I'm sure I could use the wasted crumbs in their food bowl, I am very careful to watch their food intake at meal time.I love the nutrition & quality of Canidae's Lamb & Brown Rice Snap Biscuits, but I will likely stick with the single 4# units in the future, which are packed in individual bags."
2,Neighbors dog likes them,"The Canidae snap biscuits arrived promptly and well packed. The box flap is difficult to open and needs a design modification. I would guess most users end up ripping it or bending it to work easier.I broke up one of the biscuits and offered one piece to my mini poodle. He pushed it around, put it in his mouth and than tossed it to the floor. He did not like the flavor, being very particular when it comes to food. So fortunately,I have a neighbors dog (black lab) who is not as particular and he is enjoying these biscuits.I appreciate the good ingredients and nutritional benefits from this product, but if my dog won't eat it, I can only give it two stars.Perhaps a sample pack of the various flavors would be helpful for consumers."
3,Dog did not like them,"I decided to try these treats because the reviews were so good and the price was great. That and the fact it is such a well known brand I had high expectations. I have a 10 month old Weimaraner that I thought would love them, however he rates it a 2 star. I was hoping he would be a little more excited about them. They are a larger treat so I break them up into smaller pieces. They also have good things in them. Most of the time he will eat the treat. Others times he will take it and then drop it in the living room and come back to it later. I will not be getting them again."
3,Creepshow. That's NOT the ticket,"Unfortunately, the comic book is not as good as the movie (in fact my favorite movie). The comic book is illistrated by a different person than the movie. That's one reason I don't like it. I'd only recommend it to fans of the movie.The comic book is basically like a storyboard for the movie. For the most part the dialogue is the same but sometimes completely different.Basically, I don't like the comic book as much as the movie, but it's not bad. I'd only recommend it to the fans of the movie. As Jordy Verell would say, ""Thats the ticket!"""
5,Creepshow,The creepshow comic book came in the mail today. I didn't quite know if it was really it because I only ordered it last Saturday.I wasn't disappointed at all. You can see how they try to make the characters in the movie look the same as in the comic book. The art work was good. The first one was Father's Day which was exactly like the movie in every way. The second story was the Lonesome Death of Jordy Verrill which could have been a little bit better. The other stories were good especiallySomething to Tide You Over which I thought was a bit funny.GET IT!!!!!!It's a great paperback...
5,"gory, fun,creepy.","GREAT BOOK, I WISH E.C WOULD START NEW EDTIONS OF THEIR OLD COMICS.KIDS A'LL GO CRAZY OVER IT."
3,S'ok,"Not bad for a 3ed solo go for the coop but as a follow up to NIGHTMARE and GOES TO HELL it is almost as if it is another artist altogether.""It's Hot Tonight"" is the only song new alice fan will reconise as he still sings it all the time.The only other semi good song is ""You and Me"" a ballad for the working man.it's good but again it's not Alice. All in all Lace And Wiskey was a let down for me,but beeing a true fan I'll keep it. Maybee even listen to it once in awhile......."
3,"Not the best album from The Coop, but fun nonetheless.","After the combined high of WELCOME TO MY NIGHTMARE and ALICE COOPER GOES TO HELL, this album comes as a disappointment. It has its moments. ""Lace and Whiskey,"" and ""Road Rats"" are rocking numbers with catchy hooks that linger in the memory. ""You and Me,"" and ""I Never Wrote That Song"" are both sweet and tender without being nauseating. ""My God"" is a decent song that unfortunately doesn't catch fire. The humorous ""King of the Silver Screen"" doesn't have the same satirical bite of Alice Cooper's earlier(and better) works. It sort of falls flat. The worst songs are ""Damned If You Do, ""Ubangi Stomp,"" and the particularly hideous ""(No More) Love at Your Convenience,"" a disco song that should be thrown out with the trash. All-in-all, this is a fun and enjoyable disc. It just won't make anyone forget such classic albums as KILLER, LOVE IT TO DEATH, or SCHOOL'S OUT."
3,Fair Effort But He's Done Better,"This album is one of the few Alice recordings that it is inconsistent. Alice has some very good songs on here like RoadRats and It's Hot Tonight, but the album also has some songs that stink like No More Love At Your Convience. The album is not horrible but do yourself a favor if you want some Alice that you may have forgotten about and check out From The Inside first."
2,Alcoholic Daze,"This album probably best represents Alice's actual state of alcoholic daze than does ""From The Inside"" - Alice's famous record about his rehab - because ""Lace and Whisky"" actually documents the effects of alcoholic inebreation while Alice was still experiencing it. This does not mean its a terrible album, only it explains why the song selection was so terrible and why he allowed the recording to be so murky and simply 3rd rate.""My God"" is the best song on it, and its a far better closer than any of Alice's other closers, save for ""Escape"" from WTMN. You also get ""You and Me"" and for my money, ""I never wrote those songs"" is a good song with a great title - (great line about making excuses.)Ironically, this is one of those few instances where an artists lesser album probably makes for a better recommendation for non fans - as even non alice fans will probably like ""you and me"" - this is an alice album you could by for your mommy, in fact..."
3,What I admire about Alice,"... is that he tries many differnt styles of music and obviously seems to have fun making all these creative and original songs and albums. Though, this is one of his weakest, it is still worth the price as some songs are just beautiful such as ""It's Hot Tonight"", ""Lace and Whiskey"" and ""You and Me"". Alice is incredibly talented and always keeps things interesting. Also, try the following album FROM THE INSIDE, thats far superior and absoutely flawless."
1,Alice at the bottom,"I had the original vinyl ""album"". I could not believe that this was the same maestro that did Killer, Billion Dollar Babies, Schools Out, Nightmare and other great albums. This work, the theme were definitely not Coop type material."
2,Cooper's weakest,"What was Alice thinking when he hoisted this to the public? This is a horribly mixed collection of pointless, insufferably pretentious, instantly forgettable material. Easily the most useless album of Alice's career, although the hit ballad 'You And Me' is very nice and the pub-rock shuffle 'Damned If You Do' is passable. But the rest... well, 'It's Hot Tonight' has definite potential as a hard rock number, the potential blown by the godawful murky mix and bewildering production-- the same problem that plagues everything else on ""Lace And Whiskey"". Skip this one unless you just have to own the complete Cooper catalog."
1,Under the Influence,This album is one reason why alcoholism is a bad thing. The follow up relase From the Inside would fare much better musically and chronicled Vincent's time in rehab/the institution. Alcohol has destroyed many a career and as another review states this album sounds flat. There are some good moments. It's Hot Tonight is a good start. Alice has even played in concerts within the last five years. But this is only his third solo record and is a far cry from Welcome to My Nightmare. It's a good thing that there are only a few albums that are this underwhelming in AC's output.Overall on Lace and Whiskey some things work and somethings don't. It is hit and miss.
1,Just too painful -- My God!,"You know, there's a reason why Alice doesn't do much of his solo period work live in concert anymore. So much of it is pitiful -- and he knows it. Ok, he'll do a few cuts from ""Nightmare"" and tons of great songs from the Alice Cooper group. But he seldom -- if ever -- plays songs from ""Goes To Hell"", ""Lace & Whiskey"", and ""From the Inside"" (the embarrassment trilogy). Out of this trilogy, this is by far the weakest -- and that's saying a lot!""But,"" the die-hards retort, ""It contains the hit single 'You and Me'"". -- just another reason to avoid this tragedy. Not any strong cuts on this one and there's really nothing positive to report on this album."
3,What We Are Is What We Are,"What we are are hard-core Alice Cooper fans to have listened to this album in its entirety more than the one time on the day we bought it. Though backed with the best songwriters and musicians, Alice's weak and uninspired delivery drag ""Maurice Escargot"" through his paces throughout most of this anemic offering (think what a sober Cooper could have made of ""It's Hot Tonight!""). In my humble opinion, this album, though eclectic and humorous, is one where the joke is on Alice. The great news here is the lush ballad ""You and Me."" Too bad they released a chopped up version as a single, even if it did chart as a Top Ten Hit. The album version features a string section that soars with over the top angst. This song is a classic, and is the bright spot on this tired yet oh so sincere Alice Cooper effort."
4,"Well, not ""definitive"" but good to have around.","The pictured cover is identical to my 1987 version. I don't know if there has been a reissue. Here are some caveats about my '87 version: 1. There are no synopses of works by Campra, Cavalli, Haydn, Korngold, nor Vivaldi: just to name a few. 2. I find the decision to group operas into periods, in both the table of contents and throughout the book, rather ostentatious. Since I am not a music scholar, I use the Index, in the back,to speed up my searches. The larger 1997, black-cover edition is more to my liking because it has more current operas."
4,Pure Classic!,"Darkthrone's Transilvanian Hunger is a timeless classic for any black metal fan. With some of the coldest, most raw production on the face of the earth, the northern pioneers in the sacred art of black metal had gone to higher plateus with the release of their third Black Metal Opus. With harsh, raw production, and pure norwegian satanic poetry Darkthrone is surely a band you will not want to miss any time soon. Pure Brilliance!"
3,It's boring,"I like Black Metal, Hell I even like Darkthrone, but this is far from their best album. I don't get why this particular album get's so much praise because it just honestly does nothing for me. Darkthrone are kickass though, A Blaze in the northern sky is much better than this album and easily fits in the top 5 classic Norwegian black metal albums. But I can't honestly say I was blown away by this. It's not even the bad production that makes it underwhelming, The guitar riffs aren't even all that evil-grim sounding, their just repetitive and....very boring."
5,Fantastic gel with great hold,"I have short hair, so I look hard for gels that do not cake up, smell great, and leave my hair touchable (as opposed to helmet head). This product does the trick. I'll buy it again and again."
5,Brother can you lend me.....,Great to read a scholarly biblical work that also make sense from a financial point of view.
5,It rocks,"Especially, I would get this album in addition to both 'Toys in the Attic', and 'Permanent Vacation'. This album's so awesome for2 great songs. Same Old Song and Dance is a classic that I couldlisten to over n over again. It rocks and Steven Tyler is just amazing. Another is great, Pandora's Box, that song rocks! Iwould get this overall!!!"
4,These wings fly high,"A great album for the ear. Seasons Of Wither, Train, and Lord Of Thighs stand out among the rest."
5,Get Your Aerosmith Wings,"This is one of the best Aerosmith albums ever, but not as ratedas Toys in the Attic. This CD has some of the best songs likeSame Old Song and Dance, Pandora's Box, & Seasons of Wither. SameOld Song and Dance is one classic that I could listen to over N'over again. If you are new to Aerosmith, you probably need thisCD. There are a few bad songs such as Sos too Bad."
5,One of Rock n Roll's greatest albums,"Aerosmith's second album,Get Your Wings is a classic.It contains the hit Same Old Song and Dance,as well as the concert and radio favorite Train Kept a Rollin'.You just gotta love Lord of the Thighs and S.O.S.(too bad).All of the songs are great.If your an Aerosmith fan or a rock n roll fan you must get this album, you won't regret it."
3,aerosmith get your wings,"aerosmith get your wings is a great recording before they really hit the big time and got in to all the excesses of rockstardom of the 70's. good hard rock that will get your booty moving, not their best but not a bad place to start if you want to hear what the old aerosmith was doing. this and rocks and toys in the attic were the best this band had to offer in the mid 70's"
2,Aerosmith's 2nd,I found it difficult to enjoy the songs I didn't already know from growing up to Aerosmith on the radio. I feel the same about their debut album I recently purchased. I should have stuck to listening to the classic red Greatest Hits record.
2,2nd Not The Charm,"With the release of their second record, Get Your Wings, Aerosmith was first trying to find their voice in the world of rock n roll. At this stage, the band gives us some gritty guitar styles and a few good hooks. However, when compared with Toys In The Attic and other material, this collection is a little bit weak.Out of the eight songs, I find three(Same Old Song And Dance, Lord Of The Thighs, and Train Kept A Rollin') stand out the most. And even these songs are good and not quite great. Seasons Of Wither is a little noteworthy too as a result of an interesting acoustic guitar passage.Seek out Toys In The Attic, Nine Lives, and/or a good compilation. This one shows a little promise but does not fully deliver."
3,Aerosmith... not at their best...,"aerosmith's ""Get Your Wings"" was a success, among many people questioned aerlier. It's okay."
2,"over-rated, like the band","The band didn't hit it's stride until ""Toys in the Attic"", and even then was nothing more than a competent take on much better British hard rock.Highly derivative,this album sounds like a small time bar band ripping off the Yardbirds,Stones,New York Dolls, etc. Advice-See if you like ""Toys"" and ""Rocks"" first-They are Aerosmith's only 2 consistent albums."
5,Five stars only because six is not an option,"Aerosmith is certainly one of the top ""Rock N Roll"" bands of our time. Get Your Wings may just be their finest effort - with Toys in the Attic and Rocks right there too. There are no duds on this album - every song is a classic."
4,Durable tape measure,The Pros: I really like the dimensions on both sides of the tape. The magnetic feature is unique and has helped me on a few occasions. The casing and blade are durable enough for daily use and comfortable to hold.The Con: There is only one negative I have for this tape is the gripper with the magnets in it is too smooth and does not grab well and is constantly slipping. There is also no notch in the gripper to hook on a nail.
1,not contractor grade,"I am a plumber who is very demanding of his tools... this product did not hold up under real work environment conditions, I can say this because I went through 2 of these tape measures in record time. May be good for a homeowner... but certainly not a contractor."
3,Bad Packaging.,"Product came as described. Very discouraged about packaging, items were thrown in the box with no padding. Items could of been damaged."
5,Comfortable to use and durable.,The Komelon 7130 is the best and most convenient measuring tape. The only problem I have experienced is people borrowing it then liking it so much they want to keep it. It is very durable and has a comfortable feel in your hand. The blade lock mechanism is easy to use and securely holds the tape in position. The magnetic end holds well against metal and the design of the tip easily grabs edges. The blade is also very easy to read.
3,"no metric scale; well built, strong magnet",no metric scalewell builtcan be firmly locked to prevent children from extending itstrong magnet helps to measure over a long distance
4,Komelon Magnetic Measuring Tape,This is a nice measuring tape for the price. It does not bend easily and having the magnet at the end is convenient if you are measuring something that has metal at one end.
5,Good temporary marking,"Add some kids and some driveway and a field day could be had. But I just needed some chalk to mark trees for felling or temporarily marking proposed trails. This white chalk has a coating to keep the chalk off your fingers. So far the chalk marks all of the other surfaces I've tried and is visible enough to see from a distance. For me, the half gross count is probably a lifetime of marking stuff, but the price was right. Good Deal."
5,If you truly want to understand Chinese you MUST read this.,"Any serious scholar or student of the Chinese language absolutely needs to read this book. He goes about ""myth busting"" and it is indeed necessary. Most people, including many native speakers, have a rather stereotypical understanding of the Chinese language.John Defrancis goes through a well laid out series of arguments with elucidating examples to drive the points home. Even native speakers will learn from this book as he is one of the world's most renown scholars and authorities on the Chinese language. There are a lot of common misconceptions about the Chinese language and Defrancis provides a well written and illuminating uncovering of those misconceptions. If you want to sound like an authority about Chinese, get this treasure."
4,A little dry but very informative,"I was interested in learning Cjinese but had no knowledge about the language so my proffesor recommended this book before I began to learn Chinese. It is very insightful and it really prepared me for Chinese by getting rid of the misinformed notions I had about the language and the writing.While it does a good job of informing you how written Chinese and Spoken Chinese work it does feel dry at times; specially when it comes to the written part of the language but there is so much misinformation he tries to unravel. Recommended if you are interested in learning Chinese but are ignorant about the language, like I was."
2,A pompous ethnocentric piece infiltrated with western superiority,"DeFrancis's voice is not new. He is complicit with the long existing alphabet literacy theory (pls refers to Paul Grosswiler's article ""Dispelling the Alphabet Effect"" on Canadian Journal of Communication, vol 29 (2004) 145-158) and its eurocentric gesture. Yes, democracy is good, science, rationality, progress are all good, anything exists that's different is inferior and is doomed to fail. We are already very familiar with this kind of ethnocentrism, however, a book with such an ideological bias cannot accurately reflect what the Chinese language really is. Language, as an indispensible cultural element that intertwines with other elements, refuses to be reduced to a pure systems of abstract symbols. The value of the Chinese language cannot be judged as being isolated from its people and its other cultural context."
4,bigger than I expected,it is bigger that I expected but I do not care. good and cool idea and works well.
1,how do i know,"I had to order this product through an US friend, because you refuse to ship to Canada. It got lost in the mail so I have no idea. Time to review whether I should use Amazon.com"
1,Look for regular calamine lotion!!!,"If you have poison ivy, this is not a product to purchase. You will waste your money. Speaking from personal experience, this product only irritates the problem even more!"
1,Not worth your time!,I thought this was going to be a movie with a storyline. I did not expect it to be the same trash that Chris Rock throws at Black Women in a documentay format!
5,Outstanding documentary by Chris rock,This movie was outstanding to me as an African American Woman. It made me go back to my natural hair and show my true beauty. Much of what Chris says is true and I now show my natural hair everywhere I go...Good by cracky cream and hello to the new natural confident me. Thanks Chris..
1,Did not receive this item and I can't figure out another way to get your attention,"I order this item at the same time I ordered another product, which I did receive. The Good Hair video was not in the box and I don't know how to get your attention to get it sent to me immediately. Thank you."
5,"I watched it on tv , it is so great I will purchase next month","I am THANKFUL I am NATURAL! LOL, a lot of stars wear weaves or have relaxers. I can't believe Raven have weave. She just had bc not a long time ago . Now I dislike her!I can't believe when i see Indian baby 's real hair being shaved off . I was shocked and cried a littleI am glad I didn't buy weave in past, I don't wear weave that much only braid once. Please stop buying weave of any kind-you don't know where other comes from"
2,Could have been better,"This movie was informative giving info on weaves, where the hair comes from and celebrities and regular people's perspective on black hair, but too much time was spent on the 'hair show' and that could have been totally clipped in favor of more footage on black hair opinions. Glad I didn't spent a lot on this dvd"
5,Eye opener,"I was all set to have a good laugh but instead I got a good lesson on how black women are destroying their hair, health and above all self-esteem. This is a must see especially for sociologists."
5,Rock Hits It On The Head,"I love this movie! I play it for everyone that has questions about my natural hair. I too have done my share of helping the African American hair care industry become richer by the minute.Now, I am stepping away from the relaxers and putting down the hot comb. In the powerful words of India Arie ""I am not my hair""!"
3,Interesting,"Very interesting and insightful movie to watch. even comedic at times, but I don't think I would have ever gone to the theater to see this one."
5,GREAT MOVIE!!!,Excellent movie! Even better than I expected. I persoanlly learned a lot of new information.
3,Could have dug a little bit deeper.,"This was ok, but I wish the documentary would have focused on women with (real) hair of varying hair textures instead of mostly focusing on celebrities with weaves, because everybody knows that when black folks speak of good and bad hair, they are mainly talking about the texture.Black hair can be nappy, kinky, wavy, curly, and even straight. What about dreadlocks and their historical significance? What about the political implications of wearing an afro? Why not challenge the perception that unrelaxed hair isn't professional? I would rather he had discussed these things instead of focusing on weave-worshipers and some silly hair show that frankly, makes black people look like fools."
3,Rock has potential,"Chris Rock has the makings of a decent film maker. I enjoyed this movie, but agree with some of the other reviewers that it didn't go far enough. The commentary by Al Sharpton was interesting, and I suspect Maya Angelou had more to say. Too much time was wasted on the Atlanta competition, which had very little to do with regular people's hair. He DID show some women with natural hair, but focused on those who aren't satisfied with theirs. His trip to India was very eye-opening, and yet I doubt anyone will change their ways despite all those being exploited to further this industry."
4,"Classic Chris Rock...with a braid, weave and a twist!","He was the right person to do this docu! Well done, Chris! It's sad to see money being wasted on HAIR though. I suppose I just don't understand the need to have someone else's HAIR sewn or (ew!) GLUED into and on my hair and scalp. Vanity has a tremendous price and I feel for the women that want a wig for hair loss caused by disease, but, healthy women who spend their last dime to put someone else's hair on themselves and forego feeding their family or paying a bill???? Shame on you..."
5,Good Documentary,"This was some nice research, Chris Rock got himself into. It was so informative. I think this is really good for person who lack appreciation for their own hair. The length some persons would go, to wear someone else's hair, and not make use of their own repeatedly or just for fashion really reveals insecurities. But also the documentary reveals how some persons are making big money out of the Hair industry. Nothing new, but I still enjoyed it."
5,Good Hair,This movie is fun and takes an interesting appraoch on tackling such a controversial issue. I am using this movie as a case study in a class.
3,Be Informed,"Silly me thought this was a Chris Rock movie. It is Chris Rock interviewing various people about African American Hair. It was informative information for a man not knowing what a weave, extentions, or clips are."
2,Disappointed,"Very disappointed with this movie and the way Chris Rock handled the topic. I won't get into all the reasons why this movie nauseated me, (thank God I didn't pay to see it). Anyway, as an African American woman, I found this movie degrading, and even racist. African American women are not the only women that do things to enhance or change their physical appearance. In particular, many Caucasian American women wear extensions (weave), all the time, and also dye their hair blonde and dye their children's hair blonde (similar to chemical relaxing treatments that African American, Asian, and Latina women use to straighten their hair). I just felt as if the movie was attacking and belittling African American women, had no educational value, and to top it off wasn't even funny. It shouldn't even be classified as a documentary, because that is not what this film is, and I was personally offended by it."
2,Defective DVD.,DVD was defective. It stopped several spots and could not be watched completely. I cleaned the CD and try to watch again but the problmes persisted. Also it took long time to recieve DVD. Not very happy with this transaction.
4,Funny but informative,"Chris Rock has a way of making serious topics funny and interesting. My son and I enjoyed watching this ""doc-hu-mentary."" We learned a lot!"
5,5 STARS,"Well informed and a good history lesson in the 'roots' of hair extensions/fake hair, was able to touch on all aspects about this phenomenon. Wasn't a fan of Chris Rock but after this dvd, I have alot of respect for him."
3,Chris Rock Hair Solution,I found the movie entertaining and brought up a lot of issues about hair that I normally would not have found funny.
5,A delightful surprise,"At first reading this book, I was caught off guard and didn't know what to expect. The further I read, the deeper I got caught in it's web of mystery and romance. I found myself taking words and sentences out of the poems and posting them on my refrigerator as an inspirational thought for the day. Her words stay with you and leave a lasting impression."
5,alan parsons project/the beatles,"The service I received was excellent,fast and after many purchases I have to say is totally reliable. I am completely satisfied."
4,A powerful album,"This is an amazingly enjoyable CD. The CD's atmosphere is strong and moving. A couple of tracks aren't great, but all the tracks maintain the theme [gambling, in one form or another] and keep you within the CD's spell to the end. ""Time"" and ""Games People Play"" are masterpieces."
5,for me... a CLASSIC.,"An atmosphere that reminds me the great ""PINK FLOYD"", especially on ""Time"".Very good album, original, conceptual, a classic !"
5,Great Title,Boy does this album bring back memories. I was a teenager when this album came out. Since they have remastered and expanded the Alan Parsons Project catalog I jumped on the opprotunity to get all of them! This album is great.
4,"ERIC WOOLFSON, WE HARDLY KNEW YE...","As chance would have it, it took Eric Woolfson to step out of the shadows and up to the microphone before the Alan Parsons Project ever got any AM airplay. This album is first-rate all the way, scoring two big hits with ""Time"" and ""Games People Play"", although my personal favourite is the instrumental ""The Gold Bug"". Highly recommended."
5,"A meaningful, intimate album","Truly a classic, must have. I am typically a fan of the heavier side, ie RUSH, Pink Floyd (that's how I got turned on to AP) but i have always loved this album. Among the best ever for ""intimate"" moments listening. Just set it to repeat and let it go. enjoy!"
3,Jack of hearts,"3 1/2Parson got a second, if brief, wind with this lushly produced smooth rock that works where many of his releases fail."
2,NOT WORTH THE $,THE CD IS GREAT! THIS COPY IS A DAD NOT A DVD I CAN'T TELL THE DIFFERENCE IN THE DAD AND THE CD THE DTS CD'S ARE MUCH BETTER
2,not their best,"I have never really liked this album, except for the three songs (Time, Games people Play, and May Be a Price to Pay)."
5,One of APP best efforts,"I rank this and I, Robot as my favorite APP recordings. The sweeping and hauntingly beautiful material is everywhere. This recording has many memorable numbers that blend in harmoniously with the entire package. This is a signature quality of APP. This is not dance or ""Crank it up, Dude"" music. It is a unique style that is very easy to listen to and reflect on."
2,Just O.K.,I did not say that I didn't like it. A couple of good songs was about it. The rest was too wimpy sounding and the extended repititions were no big deal.
5,"a GREAT performance piece, Unbelieveable","From the moment I read the opening sentances of this book I was hooked in. Maime pulled me into her reality in a way that very few characters ever have. I had been looking for a piece to do for Dramatic Interpretation in speech/debate when I came across it.Marisa Kantor Stark did a wonderful job on this novel. And with this performance peice I won the position of 1st Alternate to the National Tournament from my state.Truly, I have come to love Maime. I especially like the parts where she would flashback to a time in her past. There were so many themes in this book it was hard to cut some of them to make the 10 minute time limit.Now, as a person who has memorized pieces of this novel by heart, I reccomend to the book not just as an award winning performance piece, but as a wonderful read.Pick it up! Stark will not disappoint you."
5,Haunting and wonderful,"As the grandson of Jewish, Polish Holocaust survivors who has spent countless hours listening to tales of fear and sorrow relating to both war-time and post-war life, I related very well to the themes and main character in Stark's book. I found the book to be very well-written and enjoyed it immensely. I look forward to Stark's next work - regardless of the subject matter. Congratulations on an excellent debut novel!"
1,Simply put...,"boring. The book reads like a writing workshop exercise, not a novel. Maime's tone is one of unwavering petulancy, and the book's central device (she turned in her parents to avoid capture) is breezed over, with hardly a mention of its political, ethical implications. It's impossible to get into the character, and by the end of the book, my sole question was: Why bother?"
1,Thin and empty,"This book on the Holocaust is an embarrassment for those who have survived. This young writer should chose subjects she might be more familiar with, like what's it's like to be a rich, spoiled brat who went to Princeton.Perhaps then she can lend insight into a subject."
2,Can't hold a charge,"I bought two of these on Amazon. One for me, one for a compatriot. We both felt very let down. The description of them is basically accurate except for the ""holding a charge"" part. Use it or not, it won't hold a charge for very long. We've never gotten a 1/2 hours use out of a charge. And they run down quickly when not in use. Otherwise they're terrific. Vendor won't take responsibility for their poor performance. Nuff said."
5,Incredible..,"Dog Fasion Disco...well what can i say about this album. Other than this is a great cd. Great songs all around, and much better effort than their previous cd. Do yourself a favor and get this cd."
3,Poet of the Blues - Willie Dixon,This Cd is ok but the music is just not up to Willie's general great standards. Willie Dixon has never disappointed me before.
5,five star service,"extremely fast delivery, great price, book in perfect condition as stated! Thanks!"
2,rock-a-bye boovy,"What can be said about this movie? OK there is a script not a very good one, not very predictable but sadly not very interesting. This movie is prometted as a good supernatural thriller. Like all thriller it is between good and evil or good and bad (you pick and am not doing it for you). It's so hard to review this movie. First Kim Basinger ,Jimmy Smits Rufus Sewell and specialy Christina Ricci are all very good. The problem is that even with those great actor the movie is just boring ,you go from scene to scene and become less and less interested you get to a stage where you loose all interest and just hope that it will end soon so you can go to bed. So in my professional opinion do not waste your time looking at this movie just go to bed and nice dreams. P.S. the 2 stars are for the actor not the movie !!!!!"
3,Not that bad!,"I really didn't think the movie was all that bad. I have seen a lot of movies that were way worse than that in my time. I found the girl Cody to be very adorable. That may be one of the reasons why I liked it. I didn't so much focus on the religious aspect of the movie but, the storyline in my opinion was very nice when you think about. Cody was just one of God's many messengers sent here for the greater good, and as we all know there is also the other side that wanted to keep her from her mission. It just goes to show that good always prevails over evil, and I don't see anything wrong with that."
1,Tripe au gratin with gratuitous violence garnish,"What a waste of time, money and effort making this trash is. Forget that ""you won't like it if you're not a Christian"" claptrap. This movie is so insulting to anyone who cares about parenting, children, the clergy, with no intelligence behind it. I'll give them some high marks for some scary special effects. But how can Kim Basinger have anything to do with this trash.Having a cult leader demonstrate to a six year old girl how to douse a homeless man with gasoline and set him on fire right in front of us? Yes, that's an important message to get out.This movie was made in the hopes of sucking up a few more hapless teenagers' movie dollars, and they didn't care for one second how they did it.Its worse sin? It's sinfully stupid. The dialog is not to be believed. ""Say his name [Satan, we assume]. SAY IT"" yells the villain as a knife is held to the throat of a small child. I think they hired a few small children to do the screenplay, is what."
1,A load of junk,"First of all, I understand the Christian Faith. But what I understand more is the art of the cinema. It does not matter ONE BIT if the film has uplifting Christian values if the whole thing is done with such bad taste and awful storytelling. A famous critic once said, ""It doesn't matter what the film is about, it's how it is about it"". This film is awful and I didn't care what happened to the little girl (whose most amazing talent is spinning plates! WOW!) Poorly executed special effects, such as the demon and the bedroom full of rats, don't help this badly acted and dull klunker. And enough with the STUPID end of the world, Christian mumbo jumbo, ala ""END OF DAYS"" and ""STIGMATA"". And just because ""THE SIXTH SENSE"" had a child with special powers, doesn't mean every film does. Just avoid this CCCCRRRAAAAPPPPP."
2,"Bless the Child, And Only the Child","That little girl really did a great job with this. She was the only positive aspect of this movie, but she was fantastic. The way her character was portrayed as a human being made you care about her. I didn't want to see someone like her get possessed by evil. She appeared to be possessed by Jesus, with her ongoing likeability. Born prematuribly and unhealthably, obstacles stood in her path of being normal, but she was still so admirable. She used her powers only to help others.Good job, little girl. As for everyone else, why did this have to be a combination of a supernatural/Christian drama and have a cult of Satanic worshippers dressed like lawyers?"
2,"""Bless the Child"" Isn't Scary, Just Silly","The main problem with a movie like this -a scary movie I mean- is when it is not scary. Kim Basinger is just bad in this film about a young girl that has a special gift to lead people to God. I wouldn't be surprised if the reason her and real life ex-husband Alec Baldwin split because of her lack of being in good movies(this and ""I Dreamed of Africa""). The young girl featured is good. But the murderer of the film has to be the screen writer chickening out when it finally get really creepy. I mean, Satan shows up, roars and is gone just like that. Why couldn't he eat someone or at least say how hell is doing these days. An okay attempt that falls short compared to others of its kind."
2,See the movie first...,"After reading the book, I hardly thought the movie was worth the money I wasted to rent it. The book is by far more encompassing, taking into account a variety of religious beliefs and deities, interesting characters and memorable internal battles with faith. The movie barely skimmed the surface of these things, and the story was vastly different. Overall...a disappointment.In all fairness, I might have enjoyed the movie as a solitary experience had I not been tainted by a truly enjoyable novel. I strongly recommend seeing the movie before reading the book."
1,One of the Worst Movies of the Year,"As far as wastes of time and money go, Bless the Child is one of the most successful. I can't think of another movie that contains as many cliches or poorly constructed symbolism. To see Kim Basinger ""acting"" in a movie that can almost be called a parody of itself is unfortunate. Actually, to see the movie at all is unfortunate. See anything else. ANYTHING."
3,ACHOO!,"Sorry about that ... the devil made me do it .....standard little fare with rather odd special effects regarding Old Nic, or if you prefer Lucifer [the pretty one] staging a comeback through Rufus Seawell' s cult[a dead ringer for a more dapper Marty Feldman -""Ma His Making EYES At me""!] Kidding aside ....'DOGMA"" is really more more more fun than this tired little epic. Lushly photographed and rather well acted by basinger, Smits and the rest - reminds STRONGLY of an earlier SMITS- the Santaria one - far scarier ...Here we have a small army of worthless, punked out goths, shooting it up and doing what comes naturally.Not sure about all of the'messages' .......after all considering this rock we inhabit - it's not really prime time galactic territory for the gods - now is it?I'd rather be in control of the entire pulse .....but that's just an opinion.For thrills - it does the job .... great sound design![Now, 'Unman, Wittering and Zygo' .... there was something....]"
3,Passable entertainment.,"First of all, this movie has nowhere near the class of ""The Omen"" but compared to similar movie released last year, ""Lost souls"" with Winona Ryder, this movie is pretty good. Kim Basinger who just won oscar a couple years ago seems confused all the time in this movie. Such a shame she couldn't get better pictures after the oscar she won (she also starred in another bad movie, I dream of Africa).Anyway the movie is predictable. About a group of religious fanatics who try to kill a child that is believe is the savior of the world. The DVD looks and sounds good and worth getting only if you are a die hard fans of Kim Basinger. If you are looking for a better film of this genre, The Omen DVD is the one to get."
1,Bad Career Move Kim....But It Happens,"I wasn't mad so much that I wasted my money on this movie. It was more the fact that I wasted my time! This movie simply had nothing going for it. It's undoubtedly Kim Bassingers' worst career choice ever. Jimmy smits should stick to television shows because their is a huge difference between the silver screen and the little grey one! As for the little girl she should watch tapes of Haley Joel Osment if she wants to really know how to be a successful young actr/actrss. Special effects were horrible, story was pretty decent but it just wasn't adapted well. Weak music as well. Also the bad guy just wasn't bad. Rent it if you must, but be prepared for an I told you so. Sorry, 1 star."
1,kim basinger... get a real job,"LIke another reviewer i agree kim basinger cannot act and this laughable film proves it! Basinger takes care of her niece, being dropped off by her drug addicted sister(who turns out will end up saving the world). and before you can say rosemary's baby basinger is involved with devil worship. from the opening scene on the bus to the end scene this movie is so bad its laughable. And kim, you just cannot act, get a real job!"
1,Read The Book!!!!,"I was highly anticipating the release of this movie because I had just finished reading the novel. Much to my horror they cut out just about everything in the novel that would have made the movie amazing. They deleted countless (important) characters and reduced Jimmy Smitts role down to almost nothing. I read the book in one sitting it was so amazing, and as I started the movie all I kept thinking was ""Is this it? Is this really it?"" Kim Basinger and Jimmy Smitts did a good job with what they were given, but had the writers kept the screenplay like the novel, their characters would have had a chance to grow and develope and their performances wouldn't have been so shallow. Remember, you cant blame everything on the actors, if the writing stinks there's not too much the actor can do with it. Bottom line-READ THE BOOK!!!! Hopefully it will erase the foul stench this bland movie left."
2,Really screwed up the original story,"I recently finished reading Bless the Child, by Cathy Cash Spellman, the original author of this story. The movie really twisted the plot around, and the characters were screwed around with. If you've read the book and want to see the movie for that reason, take my advice and don't see it-they are two different stories entirely."
3,Not as bad as people say it is,"Although I whole-heartingly agree Kim Basinger did a horrible job, this movie has a great and entertaining story. If you dont mind a bit of exploitation, then you will likely find this movie entertaining. Rufus Sewell does a great and creepy job of playing the creepy cult leader. So if you arent somebody who usually gets frustrated and offended by religious horror movies, rent this and it will make one of the best movie rentals you ever had."
3,"good,not great, but in it's own way a excellent movie!","I like the movie, basically, because jimmy smits was in it. He's very nice looking. Plus, the girl did a good job on her part as well as kim basinger. i give it 3-stars. like I said, not a bad thriller-suspense movie."
3,Not as Blessed,"Reading a review before the movie was out I was intrigued by the mysterious plot and wanting to see Kim Basinger perform made me order the vhs tape. But I must admit that I was disappointed. So much, in fact, that I didn't watch the whole tape."
2,FALLS FROM GRACE,"This is one of those movies that has a good idea but cannot seem to figure out just what to do with it. The early segments of the film are testament to this, because, at first, I was really hooked and enjoying myself and wondering what had sired all those bad reviews I'd read. But mid-way into the film what was subtle becomes blatent, what was creepy becomes cheesy, and what was promising does not ever find its full potential. The climax of the film is completely underwhelming, though mid-way through things start to become more amusing than frightening. All in all, it's a bottom-of-the-wrung supernatural thriller, and if you want to see good against evil on a Biblical scale, check out The Devil's Advocate instead."
3,Someone should expand this book,"Besides the many duplicate pages, the booklet has some value. Its a basic introduction to water buffalo in general. Wish it would give information about water buffalo in the western hemisphere. You'll have to do your own internet research for that."
5,The Best Performance for Brigadoon,I played the role of Meg Brockie in college so am very familiar with this show. This is much much much better than the movie version cd.
5,Stellar performances,"These are beautiful voices and gorgeous music-I highly recommend this album. Particularly like all of Shirley Jones and really like Jack Cassidy singing ""There but for you go I"""
3,New Restoration of The Cabinet of Doctor Caligary,"David Shepard's new restoration of The Cabinet of DoctorCaligari (Kino Video Release) contains additional footage--notpresented in this VHS version--as well as original art deco intertitles & a better translation. Unlike the Kino/Shepard ""cut"", this version of Caligari is, as Robert Keppler puts it, incomplete, ""poorly translated, & taken from negatives that were shot from inferior angles, thus cutting out a lot of important details in the picture itself."
4,Amazing Silent Film with Style,"I'd seen pictures from this film for years. Whenever people would talk about ""German Expressionism"" it seems like stills from this film would follow. I took a risk and ordered it and got a great surprise!First of all, this film is crafted incredibly well considering the year (1919 I think ...) it was made. The story telling is great. You can see cinematic tricks that modern filmmakers have aped (*see BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA by Coppolla. It's full of ""silent movie"" techniques).This DVD features ""tinted"" scenes. There is a horrible line across the top of the film that the DVD ""editors"" chose to keep for this edition instead of cropping it out. ** All the more reason for FILM PRESERVATION! There's a great commentary audio track. I think they've done an incredible job with the technical aspects of the presentation."
4,Imagine watching a Calvin Clien OBSESSION commercial on acid,This is a very abstract film and requires a open mind to view. Words can not describe this visual masterpeice. A unique film that leaves you thinking.
1,The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1919),"The story is told in a very simplistic manner and the pace is sluggish. The hammy, melodramatic acting really dates the film and causes what was once a horror film to seem comedic. The one high mark is that the twist ending actually surprised and impressed me."
4,FUN IF SPEEDED UP,"A movie that is almost 100 years old---and more entertaining that most contemporary 21st century movies.Speed up the dvd, and listen to some trippy music on your stereo at the same time for a more modern feel. There have been versions of this movie shown on tv with eerie electronic scores, so why not? No reason why you have to settle for an authentic silent movie score for such an avante-guarde movie.The print for this cheapoh version is bad, but why pay an arm and a leg for a silent movie? For under a buck for a used version of this classic, do some experimenting with the score with a seperate cd on your stereo.And maybe catch MARCH OF THE WOODEN SOLDIERS---to see how the villain in that Laurel and Hardy movie was influenced by DR CALIGARI."
3,"An historical curio, acme of German expressionism","Another silent film that has not aged too well but is still of great interest to lovers of silent film and film history. The plot is none too innovative but the wild, original sets made this one stand out from the crowd. The direction is actually a bit wooden. It is the work of the set designers which actually made this one a stunning experience to early film audiences."
3,rock and roll vampire video,I am not sure if people realize this. But this movie's theme and look is reproduced in Anne rice's movie adaption of Queen of the Damned. It is used as one of the vampire lestat's music video's (FORSAKEN)featured at the beginning of the film. The music video version is very gothic and vamperic. I really like the darkness surrounding the films concept. I just recently orderd it and can not wait to see this movie. It looks awesome for a silent film.
4,If Dr Seuss made silent horror films...,"This is certainly one of the most interesting silent films of the time period. Unusual story line, beautiful use of light and shadows and very artistic sets all askew as if from a Dr Seuss illustration. Whether you are into German Expressionism or not, this is an entertaining movie to watch. The score for this edition was absolutely horrid- synthesizer and electric guitar-that does not go with the movie at all. After muting the sound the movie was great."
5,"Stylish, Artistic, Creepy, the Grandfather of Twist Endings!","This silent film from 1921 has got such an eerie and ominous feel to it that it's almost physical. Slowly crawling into the viewers minds are the haunting images of acid-trippy set design, the furtive, meaningful glances of Dr. Caligari, and many, many dark things implied. Much of the story is pushed along not through the visual spectrum but by what the viewer is forced to conjure as happening. When the screen proclaims there have been murders, the viewer sees them in bright, bloody detail. They hear the screams, feel the stabs, and know the maddness of the killer. Keep in mind this is a silent film! The bizarre set design, flawless performances, and the final scene with its seriously twisted ending make this essential viewing for any film connosieur, especially those of you that stray toward the genre of horror. Come and take a look inside The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari!"
2,Not my type of movie,Turned it off after 5 minutes watching it. Old style movie with no sound just music in backround with subtitles
1,Be careful which version,"I bought the Alpha Video version and am not very pleased with the quality, picture, or music. I heard the Image Entertainment version is the best and I'm not sure about the Kino version. I'm watching a version on youtube that's far superior to the dvd I purchased. Waste of five bucks."
3,Must be seen more than once,"I first saw this on TV when I was 14. Didn't know what the heck was going on, but the imagery stayed in my mind. I recently saw this again for the first time in over 20 years. NOW I get it. The story is very creative (makes me wonder if the ""13th century myth of Caligari"" was an actual German legend-does anybody out there know for sure?), but you really have to see this more than once to fully ""get it."" Very interesting. See it and enjoy."
3,A great movie; tinted color is horrible,"I love this movie but I won't watch this version because it has been tinted in pastel shades. Also, if I remember correctly, the text has been changed to some ugly font. I bought an unrestored, cheap DVD copy of the film in a pharmacy recently and would much rather watch that one than this one. Bottom line: Superb movie, but don't bother with this version."
4,not half bad,"But I need more. I picked up the book whilest at the library one night, attracted to it mainly by its cover. I started to read it that very night, got hooked on it, and spent just about every free moment I had, which isn't a lot for a high school student sometimes, reading the book. I was really getting into it, but also noticed the fact that I seemed to be far from a conclusion as I saw the pages before the ending growing fewer and fewer. The book itself is excellent, and will be even better in a sequel, assuming there is one, and I'm really hoping for one. So while the book was excellent, the ending was not the greatest all considered."
3,Just okay,"I think this is just okay. I am quite the music buff. I am originally from the South and have listened to country music all my life. Although, I do not doubt the lyrics to be from the heart and her voice is strong and deep, I think that this is an ""okay"" first attempt. I think with some work, she might pull it out for the next CD release."
5,Funniest Anatomical book I have ever read,Too bad this book is out of print! This deserves to be reprinted.
5,Charged album one of the best of the 80's,"The first Chameleons album and one of the most memorable musical artifacts of its decade, Script Of The Bridge is shamefully unknown. From the thoughtfully rabid force of the opening track ""Don't Fall"" through disturbing-yet-comfortable gems like ""Monkeyland"" and ""Second Skin"" the album continues to thrill and intrigue with each listen as it digs itself deeper and deeper into the listener's veins. The best track is probably ""Up The Down Escalator"", which is about as close as a four minute song can come to an epic, but each and every song is alone worth the cost of the album. Script Of The Bridge is especially potent when the listener is in an introverted state of distress; then there is nothing else on earth like it. In any case, however, Script Of The Bridge is a gorgeous, devastating first step in a stunning career, and is well worth any record buyer's money."
5,Discover this band NOW!,"This is my favorite Chameleons CD, and one of my favorite albums ever. Standouts on this include Second Skin, Monkeyland, and Don't Fall.Never as popular as Joy Division, The Cure, or the Bunnymen, the Chameleons were absolutely unique in that they never produced a bad song. Ever! (Except maybe one track from their reunion album in 2001). That's probably because they never strayed far from their formula -- you know a Chameleons song when you hear one! They are my favorite post-punkers."
5,One of my all time favorite's,I had no idea so many other's loved this CD as much as me! Cool! Get this CD - it's simple.
1,Worst Heinlein book so far......,"Let me begin by saying I love Heinlein books. This one, however, stinks. The idea of the brain transplant, although silly, is exciting yet Heinlein really bombs by not developing a real plot around the character. The result is a painfully long story of sexual awakening."
2,What does the title have to do with the content?,"Did Heinlein pick ""I Will Fear no Evil"" simply because it is a cool title? To me, it has no revelance to the actual content of the book.. or am I missing something?"
1,THE BOOK THE EDITOR FORGOT ABOUT,"I am really proud of myself because i have read every heinline book and short story ever. I am completely serious about this. I really must say that this book along with ""the rolling Stones"" is his worst book of all time. It belongs in the romance novel section. The begining had me intrigued, i thought i was in for another great Heinlien, but it goes downhill fast. After johan gets a brain transplant into the body of his beutiful young secratary, he looses all of his gall, and all of his will. I also found the sections devoted to describeing an excersise regemin absurd. After i finished this book i laughed. I do have a conspiracy theory about this book though. Henlien wrote the first chapter, and Daniel Steel interceded and wrote the rest. I guarentee you thats what happened. I bet the editor droped his draft somewhere and he didnt have the heart to tell Robert A. Think about it."
3,Sex on the brain,"Heinlein may be one of the great masters of science fiction, but his novels also tend to be oversexed, and this one is no exception. The ""Free Love"" theme of the 1970's is quite evident here, and gets quite tiring by the book's end.The book concerns a rich old man named Johann Sebastian Bach Smith, who (in order to live longer), wishes to have his brain transplanted in a younger body. The twist comes in when it gets transplanted into the body of his sexy young female secretary! There's a lot of gender-bending and sometimes thought-provoking questions about male vs. female psyches, but after 500 pages, it gets rather lengthy and dull.In the author's defense, Heinlein (as always) manages to paint some very interesting and charismatic personalities on paper. If you haven't yet read it (although most people have), I recommend instead Heinlein's Stranger in a Strange Land. While also oversexed, is much more interesting and not quite as droning as I Will Fear No Evil."
2,Interesting idea - lousy execution,"Feel free to include me on the list of those who liked the premise of the book much better than the book itself. Instead of being a thought-provoking examination of gender roles and sexual identity, this comes across as one of those self-indulgent (i.e. boring) letters to Penthouse Forum...without the details. The interminable dialogues about clothing (or lack thereof), along with those of which characters haven't had dalliances were nearly excruciating. And let's not even get started on the cloying conversations between the two main characters; simply gag-inducing.I've long been a fan of RAH's work, but this one left me extremely unsatisfied (no pun intended)."
2,Possibly the worst Heinlein novel,"This was awful. I gave it 2 stars cuz it RAH - but this was a one star book. The characters were unlikely and had motivations that were obscure and at least to me, seemed unlikely.There were still a few chuckles to be had, and a passage or two had me thinking it may turn aroud and get good, it just never happened.This was largely a soapbox piece. It was hard to believe how far left RAH ended up after how far right he started out, but this was a clear indication of the hippy / free love impact in his later wrtings. Gotta make you pretty sure RAH and his wife were swingers, though I have never read anything to lend that credence, just reading this book makes me think so.If you arent a hardcore fan, skip this one."
3,Possibly Intriguing,"If the idea of human brain transplantation intrigues you, especially the transplant of an old male brain into the body of a voluptuous young woman, give this book a try. Otherwise, forget it. I estimate, very roughly, that the book is 20% decent SF, 40% average storytelling and character development, 30% psycho-sexual babble, and 10% very soft porn, titilatiing, but not explicit. Some of the brain's internal babbling did get annoyingly repetitive, e.g., ""I did X while your grandmother was still a virgin."" I wonder if Heinlein was well enough to edit this story to his satisfaction before he died. I also wonder if he had originally intended a sequel to take place on the Moon; the ending is abrupt and unsatisfying."
2,Super Reader,"This book is somewhat odd, and really, not that good. Heinlein's main character here is an old man, and he is transplanted into a young woman's body, and learns to experience things from the female perspective.So, bits about the difference between the sexes and how they look at and thing about things, as some of her consciousness is still there."
3,He struck pyrite in a gold mine.,"The novel was a good novel, but, in a sense, it wasn't. The storyline was interesting, but all was predictable. Also, you could tell a lot come from Stanger in a Strange Land (my personal favorite). The end got off from being that compelling sci-fi to this mush, sick, deluded world of a personal fantasies."
5,Heinlein is a Master,This is an excellent story from a master of his craft. One of my top 10 books of all time.
2,got bored,Stopped reading about 20% into the book. Just got bored. Dated and predictable. Love the cover though it's a genuine knockout.
1,Please don't let this be your first Heinlein book,"I've read the majority of Heinlein's work over the past 10 years (in fact, ""Revolt in 2100"" was my first sci-fi book), and ""I Will Fear No Evil"" is the worst. It is here that Heinlein sets the tone he followed for all his later books: two one-dimensional characters -- the gruff, wise man who's always right, and the self-obsessed woman who always needs protection from her man -- lots of meaningless sex, and some claptrap about how great life was in the 1920's (when Heinlein came of age).Heinlein's early work (1930's through 1960's) is superb, and I recommend it all as some of the most creative, original writing around. But please, if you want to begin Heinlein, don't start with ""I Will Fear No Evil."" And if you are a devoted Heinlein fan (as I am) and want to stay that way, skip this book."
2,The worst book he ever wrote,"I loved Heinlein's books, couldn't get enough of them, but I wish he'd never written this one.Sorry."
5,The Second Trip,"Macho, macho man; I've got to be a, whoops, where's my willy? Heinlein's medication must have backed up on him while he was writing this. I guess every man has wondered what it's like for the girls, but very few volunteer to find out. Johann Sebastian Bach Smith's elaborate suicide scheme to escape his nightmarish, over-medicated old age, an impossible body transplant, backfires by actually working. Smith finds himself in the body of his recently-deceased secretary, along with the mind of the secretary herself. It's actually a damn good book, but we are talking major league weirdness here as Smith sets out to explore this brave new world, jiggling all the way."
1,only sci-fi romance novel I ever read,"This book was absolutely horrible. The very beginning was interesting, especially when Johann was still Johann and being a real head-strong individual. After that, the book was total crap. It turned into a dialogue about who kissed whom, why it was done, whether or not it was good, whether or not Johann-Eunice should have sex with one person or another, and on and on and on. Then toward the ending, Jake arrives in their head with no reasoning or justification whatsoever. The final thing that tore it for me was the exchange of Joan with the beaurocrat who reviews her entrance to Luna. The whole thing about her parting with him as ""friends"" and getting her good-bye kiss just made me absolutely ill. This book's ideas became boring and repetitive real fast, and it turned into a sappy-crappy romance novel."
2,Awful. Boring. Childish.,"Considering Heinlein is best known for Stranger in a Strange Land (which I have not read), which is about a man who teaches the world about love, I was shocked to find that Heinlein seems to have the sexual maturity of a 13 year old. Interactions between the sexes in his books are incredibly awkward and unrealistic, and I usually find his female characters somewhat insulting to the sex. So you can imagine how strange and convoluted this book is. Aside from being hard-boiled, corny, and shallow, it is also incredibly boring. I gave up on it about two-thirds through, and I HATE not finishing a book. After being (almost) equally disappointed in Starship Troopers, I really don't know if I have the patience to give this supposed Grandmaster another chance."
2,Meh,What would it be like to live another life in the body of the opposite gender?This could have been done so much better.
1,"Great Author, Terrible Book","Basically, this is about an old guy who gets his brain transplanted into a womanm then he/she loves everyone and has sex with everyone. Near the end, she decides she wants to sleep with the several thousand people who have immigrated to the moon. There are about 50 good pages among the 517, the rest are just awful. Nothing happens. His other books are MUCH better."
1,"Well, one of Heinlein's books has to be his worst...","...and this is it. While it's true that Heinlein's work hasn't aged well, this one was an embarrassment at the time, and should be avoided, unless you just have to read everything he wrote."
1,Ugh.,"Johann Sebastian Bach Smith is filthy rich and about 90 years old. He arranges to have his brain transplanted into a younger body when he goes. It just happens that the body is that of his gorgeous female secretary, Eunice. So, now he has to learn to be female... and it also just so happens that Eunice still kind of inhabits her body and the two of them have really great conversations. Okay. Interesting idea. I could not read more than half of this. I found the dialogue stilted and awkward. I kept thinking, people don't really talk like this! I couldn't keep my disbelief suspended. And, by the way, Eunice acts like men wish women would, but few do. Really unbelievable and disgusting. Lots of adult topics explored. Not impressed."
1,Dull...dull....dull,"OK, so what am I missing about Heinlein's writing that everybody likes so much? This book was awful! In typical Heinlein style he fills the book with endless inane bantering between characters (in this case the main character keeps talking to himself) and then key points and plot twists get the better half of a paragraph and then its on to more endless rambling. About of the way through the book I kept thinking of potentially good plot twists or events that could spice up the story, but nothing happened, it just went on and on up until the last sentence which concluded the story without any fanfare. It literally was a chore to read this book."
3,"Not Heinlein's best work, but still enjoyable","My star rating appears to be three, but what I really want to give it is 3.5 stars.This book starts off with a fascinating premise - and the first half of the book is a good, solid read about a man who gets a second chance at life in the body of a pretty young woman. Unfortunately, later on it starts to become silly as it unravels. The ending was preposterous, but what could I do?No one can hit them all, and this was one of Mr. Heinlein's misses (though he had been hitting it in the start of this book). Only if he had handled the second half of this book in a tighter and better way, this book would have become one of his more memorable works."
2,Skip this one and save a tree!,"Heinlen is a genius, but you'd never know it from reading this book.The book starts out brilliantly, with two main characters: Johann Smith - a cunning old codger at the end of his years, and Eunice Branca - beautiful woman with enough love in her heart for the whole world. Through a twist of events Johanns brain is transplanted into Eunices body, while still inhabited by her gost, who only Johann can hear and speak too.You are enticed by the idea of seeing the difference in how the sexes get what they want, but instead you are taken on a tour of this womans' sex life. The book completely loses any focus it might have had. and you are then tortured as you have to finish the next 300 pages with no real energy or point to the story.Here's the book in a nut shell:Men get what they want through power. Women get what they want by being sweet. Vengeance, Rudeness, and Jealousy are destructive to both. Old people have been there and done ! that."
4,Heinlien at his most demented,"Although this is not a masterwork by the master of Sci-Phi, it is a very thought provoking book. Take a dirty old man who wants to die, put him in the body of his favorite sectretary (11 on a scale of 1-10), and mix. One of Heinlien's first anti-bible belt novels, it challenges the morals of American society. Although the ending was weak, the charachters are well thought out. Not recomended for children."
1,Porn Trash without the Porn,"Interesting idea in this one, but there were a couple of flaws- the main, of course, being that the book is a 400 page ramble about WHO HE IS GOING TO HAVE SEX WITH. And (correct me if I'm wrong here, but I checked pretty thoroughly) every single person we know the name of he/she kisses. I found this to be one of the most boring books I have ever read."
4,A great yarn from a legendary reporter.,"Drummond, a reporter with CBS-owned Channel 2 in Chicago for many years, is best known for covering the ""Outfit"" in Chicago. As any Chicagoan can attest, he also covered many characters and other crooks, besides the big fish that hogged the headlines. Although there is a chapter on Tony ""Big Tuna"" Accardo, Drummond wisely focuses on the little guys that many of us forgot. This is a smart choice, for much is already written about the big guys like Accardo and if Drummond wanted to cover them right, he would of had to have written a separate book on several people. The only thing missing in the book is more on Drummond himself, for if you are a personal friend of his, as I am, you know that he is more interesting than any of the crooks and capers he ever covered. Read this book and try to learn as much as you can about John Drummond - a living Chicago legend and a journalism institution!"
5,memory lane,"Growing up in Chicago in the late 60's and thru-out the 70's and 80's, I loved the John BullDog Drummond segments on the local news.If you looked up the word reporter in the dictionary, There would be a picture of BullDog in his Trench-coat, hair slicked back with the giant microphone giving you the FACTS.Allot of the time it was Mob HITS. READ this Book!!!!!Great Stories."
4,Good but a little Bias,"This book is good background but be wary, my teacher has read much of the ancient Greek this book refers to and warns that the book tends to state things as fact that are very much up for debate for the convenience of having a definitive answer."
2,Disappointing,"Since I already had both El Sombrero de Tres Picos and El Amor Brujo on vinyl, I bought this disc specifically for the DVD Audio 5.1 format to enjoy in my Acura's ELS sound system. Unfortunately, this disc falls about 3.0 short! The rear and center channel levels are so diminished I thought the speakers had failed. While the musical performance is supurb, don't waste your money on this disc."
2,Slow and noisy product,"Boy, I wish I'd read these Amazon reviews before purchasing this. I previously had the 2006 version and found it satisfactory. My troubles began with installation which took well over an hour. I could have lived with that but for the past month I've had to put up with a slow computer and seemingly constant hard-drive noise. I suspect the only solution is to bite the bullet, wave my 50 bucks goodbye and uninstall it.Oct. 20 update: Peace and speed at last. I removed pc-Cillin yesterday and replaced it with AVG-Free and Ad-aware SE. My computer is now back to its speedy and quiet self."
3,"memory hog, nonresponsive support","PcCillin internet secuirty 2007 is consuming 150MB of memory on my Windows 2000 machine, even if all options are turned off.I had poor experience with their support. The first two times they didn't even try to understand the problem, the third time the nature of the problem finally sank in but they had nothing to suggest. Each of the three times I contacted them it took a week or more to get a response."
3,A Change From Last Year,"I was so pleased with the 2006 version that I renewed. However, the 2007 version brought with it several frustrations. The same websites that loaded so quickly before have slowed way down. When I chose to copy all my settings to the new version, I am constantly having to click ""Allow"" for various software items that I had already approved with version 2006. Shutting down the computer is even slower as well. Whatever they did between 2006 and 2007 really screwed up a good product. My wife and I are skeptical if we will renew next year?"
1,Trend Micro needs to TEST products before release,"I have used PC-cillin for several years and installed on many of my family and friend's Desktops and Laptops. When we started to go to the 2007 version...that is when we had problems. I read from other reviews that it made people lose their internet connection. I had the same problem. Actually, Firefox worked, but it changed my IE settings so that IE did not work. We use MS XP and IE 6."
1,What a D-R-A-G,"Well, this product was certainly a waste of money this year. I was pleased with the 2006 version and happily bought the 2007 version, assuming I'd be just as delighted as year.I was astounded to see that this program took up approximately the same amount of memory as Microsoft Office 2003. I reinstalled it, selecting the custom install, hoping to load just the anti-virus portion. The program still indicated the same unbelievable amount of memory. I uninstalled it, searched reviews from CNET and PCWorld and took their advise and purchased Kaspersky Antivirus 6.0 and am delighted with it.I don't know how Trend Micro managed to miss the mark so badly this year."
2,Problems,"2006 version was jumping on my monitor twice monthly, right in the middle of presentation with request to register again, again and again. Anyway I get new PC-Cillin 2007. Problems started right away. It was very hard to install it on my home computer. On my laptop I get only message ""Fatal error"" many times instead of telling: use another disk. There are in the box 2 disks without explanation. I get Microsoft security, hope it will work better."
1,Careful with PC-Cillin it may lock up your computer,"I bought the 2007, three license version of this softare. It locked up two of my computers. I communicated the problem with the people from Trend Micro and their recommendations failed to fix the problem. After having two computers being unusable for over ten days, I went back to McAfee Security Suite.About two weeks later, I received another note from Trend Micro saying that since I have a Linksys wi-fi, there is a conflict between the firewall of Pc-cillin and the Linksys firewall. Funny that there is no conflict McAfee's and the Linksys' firewalls. Anyway, I am tossing PC-Cillin in the trash as it is more problems than it's worth. What a waste of almost $40."
2,I just uninstalled it for good,"This program is an absolute nightmare. It takes up over 1000mb of space, you cannot program when it does it's searches, so it'll pop up 5 or 6 times during your computer time, once it starts it's random spyware scan, you can't stop it. It's a mess. IT came preinstalled with my dell, and now that i've just removed the entire program, my laptop is lightning fast. Junk. Avoid at all costs"
2,Makes your PC crawl.,"This may be a great product, but it makes my PC crawl. I hate waiting a minute or two for an application to load. Why have a high powered PC only to have the software make it act old.It does not play well with others - I had to uninstall Spybot. Every tech article I've read recommends running multiple programs to protect your PC.Tech support is clueless.I'm about to remove this product and download AVG. (When I do this, my PC account will be demoted to a regular user so no software can be installed without my knowing it.)PS. As for the guy who gave this product 5 stars because Consumer Reports says it's good...even they say that it slows your PC's performance."
1,Where to begin...,"After I got this product, I was excited as I looked around at the cool features, get all my scans scheduled and it was all gravy. Then, I started the scan, and no matter what I selected it only scanned for spyware, no virus scan. I then call Trend Micro and they tell me that the version, that they mass produced and sold for $60, was a bad version. It had lots of problems. Which I soon found out when they told me to uninstall and install another version. It was unable to uninstall right. And after 4 calls to tech support waiting at LEAST 10-15 each time before talking to a foreign accented tech, it was off and the new version ready to go. This version had the same problem, along with more. The webpage that was supposed to display at program launch would never find the site and pop up a error. Still wouldn't scan my computer for virus. I Don't wish this product on my worst enemy. Norton has their act together on the new 360 '07. Much better product."
1,Junk,"Horrible product. I have used pc-Cillin since 2005, the previous versions were much better. Pc-Cillin 2007 slowed my computer to a useless crawl. I tried all of the various ""fixes""; nothing worked. I ended up uninstalling the software. This seemed to be the only real fix."
1,Not Worth The Trouble,"I installed this on two of my computers. Both computers would no longer let me open certain programs or let me log onto my bank accounts. I could go to my e-mail and read them, but could not get into any e-mail folders or delete or move any e-mail files. Somehow the software locked up internet explorer and they could not figure out why. It did it on two different computers. I spent over two weeks working with Trend Micro on the problem and they could never fix it. I told them I would uninstall the program from both of my now half working computers and would like a refund of my money. They said they do not do that but would keep trying to help me fix the problem. After two weeks of no solution I was tired of their inefficiency. I had to reinstall my Windows XP and Vista to fix the problem. I went with Kaspersky and have had no problems. So I am out of $45.00 with Trend Miro."
3,Security 2007,"Installed in September 2007, had a problem right away, both my dvd drive an cd drive stopped working, as soon as you would put a disk in the system would freeze up, I got with tech support and they help me install in newer version, ( took about a hour to do)after that it has work fine, I like it better that norton."
3,Takes up a lot of ram,"It does a good job of protecting my computer, when I can use my computer. This product takes up a lot of RAM and so my computer takes forever to boot up and sometimes I have to go through my task manager to shut parts of it down just so I can work. I had the older version (2006) and that was far easier to use."
2,PC-Cillin Very Slow,"I originally bought the 2006 version of PC-Cillin Internet Security, and then upgraded to 2007. It is painfully slow, particularly with Spyware scans which can take 18 hours or more. While they are running, everything slows to a crawl. This means I almost never get a scan completed, I have to stop it to get work done. I've made all the fixes on the pc-cillin web site to no avail. I thought that Norton Anti-virus was inadequate, but this is horrible.There is little doubt in my mind that it is conflicting with some other software on my machine, but I have already spent dozens of hours fighting it."
2,Resource Hog - good only if you've got a lightning fast system,"Beware, the process pcscrnsrv.exe runs intermittently and can zap up to 100% of your CPU resources. This effect should be minimal for those with dual core processors and lots of RAM. However, if you're running anything less than the latest, you may want to test this before buying. Although it runs decently on my Dell 2 GHZ, 1.5gb RAM, it slows down web browsing, program startup, and email enough to be frustrating..."
1,Virus Disabled It,"When I bought my Dell this was installed on it and the program seemed to be effective for the first nine months of my subscription. However it stopped working or updating with about three months left. It turns out that a virus had disabled it, even though that's what it's supposed to protect against. I had to download Norton to get rid of 2 downloaders, trojan.adclicker, adware.purityscan, adware.ismonitor, 2 trojan.vundo, and a trojan horse. I would advise against this product. I'll never use another Trend product."
1,Junk!,"Purchased 3-years of PC-Cillin with my Dell desktop. Useless and non-functioning (compliments the Dell quite nicely, actually). With two years of paid coverage remaining, I deleted this nightmare of a program entirely and went with Comcast's McAfee freebie."
1,you will so regret it if you buy this,"OUTRAGEOUS piece of garbage. Not only is it a memory pig, it causes windows to crash. Our system was crippled while this software was installed. And I didn't isolate the problem until after the 30-day guarantee. So I'm out $50 + the many hours I spent trying to nurse my system along.And it looks like the 2008 version has the same problems. Way to go, guys!"
1,Trendmicro's PC-cillin is a disaster and support is non-existent.,"PC-cillin 2007 blocked access to my network scanner and destroyed my ""palm pilot hotsync software installation"". It deleted other important files without providing a means to get them back. Furthermore, there's no way to fix these problems with PC-cillin installed. I emailed ""TrendMicro Support"" for help and they did email back but only to advised me to search through their support pages (which were of no help in this case). After two weeks of frustration, I finally uninstalled PC-cillin 2007. I had to use XP's ""System Restore"" to get my system back to where is was previously. PC-cillin might be OK if you have a very simple computer setup. But for me, PC-cillin was worse than a virus. I will never buy from ""TrendMicro"" again."
4,Decoding Dan Brown's false claims,"This book does a good job of debunking his claims. The Da Vinci Code is a fun FICTIONAL book.In regards to those reviewers that are mystified by why a book like this is necessary or of interest in relation to a piece of fiction, I think they do not realize that while the characters and general storyline are fictional, Dan Brown actually claims that the historical data in his book is fact."
4,Vety well thought out,"This book, though not as thourough nor as good as ""Breaking the Da Vinci Code"", certainly gives a good response to the so called work of fiction ""The Da Vinci Code"". In our post-modern world people accept anything as true - as long as it is entertaining. This author's book is certainly not as entertaining as Dan Brown's book of lies - but it is factual and true, both historically and Biblically."
4,Essential Fallacies of the Da Vinci Code,"Despite all the hype surrounding it, the DaVinci Code is really nothing new. For the longest time, enemies of the Christian faith have tried to falsely ascribe its teachings to pre-existing pagan beliefs. Abanes shows the essential differences between pagan and Christian teachings. Decades ago, the feminists had developed an elaborate mythology, not founded on facts, of onetime global goddess worship. This has been repeated by the DaVinci Code, and Abanes exposes the baselessness of this feminist pseudohistory. Likewise, Abanes exposes the long-rejected error of ""older"" gospels giving an authentic alternative view of early Christianity. Then, besides showing the fact that recognition of the Deity of Jesus Christ long predates Constantine, Abanes also debunks the alleged powers of the Emperor Constantine in enforcing Christian doctrine. Abanes also shows how the persecution of witches has been greatly exaggerated."
5,"Excellent, Concise Resource!","This title by Abanes is an excellent, concise resource for anyone wanting to clarify or verify the claims made in Dan Brown's book, ""The DaVinci Code."" The format of Abanes' book is a great help, for it lists various controversial areas that Brown addresses then provides an accurate, Christian response. This little volume is a breath of fresh air for the layperson who has been suffocated by the Code's academic-sounding arguments."
2,Debunking Abanes,"Abanes falls into the same trap he accused Brown of-- insufficient research, half-truths, and failing to state his own bias. He uses such ""authorities"" as Wicca and national magazines. But he has failed to read current theological scholars who, for example, acknowledge that Christianity originally was made up of many similar and disparate groups, and that there well may have been a movement to repress what the Magdalene stood for. He also understands very little about symbolism."
3,Fascinating,"While full of interesting facts and perhaps a useful research launchpad for those interested, I do wonder at the validity of the marketing lean toward debunking a work of fiction i.e fiction = stories about imaginary people and events (just one of many extremely similar reference definitions). It's like trying to disprove the existence of Never never land, why bother."
3,breaking the human domination...,"Dan Brown categorized his book under ""fiction"". Therefore, those who challenge the content of his fictional idea are in question.We are speaking of a subject no one knows for sure; therefore, whoever claims he/she knows the truth and lure to share this limelight with his/her own assumption is nothing more than jumping on the band wagon for fame and fortune. Nevertheless, I do find Dan Brown's ""fiction"" quite riveting as claimed by the wagon jumper and I most certainly enjoyed it."
2,Typical Cut-down of something that threatens a belief.,"People are so concerned that their faith will be threatened by another's opinion. Do I believe what is said in the Da Vinci Code, not necessarily. But look at the other books that Richard Abanes has written. Obviously he feels threatened by other lines of thought. I respect his opinion, but that is what it is, an opinion just like Dan Brown.If you read the Da Vinci Code looking for truth than you need to have your head looked at. If you judge the book evil before you read it than I am so sorry that you feel wavering in your beliefs. It is a Fiction book, nothing more. A good read too.You can find a book that tears down any belief out there. The purpose of books like that are to neutralize them as threats. Know what you are reading and take it as it is."
4,Very interesting...,"**** Although the Da Vinci Code is classified as fiction, many seem to take it and its relatives as fact, giving them cause to question their faith or feel justified in their lack of it. As the movie based upon it gets closer, Christians begin to worry that all the good done by Mel Gibson's Passion movie might be undone. To answer the challenge, a host of noted Christian writers have come out with books to expertly tear apart the allegations and mistakes made in Mr Brown's fictional novel. Although much material is repeated in every one of them, the format does vary. Mr Abanes has utilized a most efficient style of presenting his facts, one that is easily readable. Even those who have not read DaVinci or one of its clones may find this educational as it presents a great deal of historical fact in a palatable manner. ****Amanda Killgore for Huntress Reviews."
5,Scholarly comeback to the Da Vinci book,"The Truth Behind the DaVinci Code by Richard Abanes dissects the pieces of Brown's novel that have been causing confusion in the church. The author quotes a passage from the book, then shows the flaws and presents the truth.This scholarly comeback to the DaVinci book was written by a recognized authority on cults and religions. His responses to Brown's book are documented and recognized fact as opposed to Brown's ""facts"" which his touts as truth. Although Brown brags on the accuracy of his story, Abanes points out that the book, while cleverly written, is diminished in overall value by the unusually high number of inaccuracies. These Abanes pulls up from the text and refutes authoritatively.It is a thorough examination of The DaVinci Code and should be read by anyone who finds himself confused by that novel. -- Elece Hollis, Christian Book Previews.com"
5,Just the facts,"This volume does what I'd hoped for--it presents Dan Brown's statements, then presents the facts and the back-up data, with extremely detailed footnotes.More importantly, it leaves the attitude at the door. Too many of the anti-da Vinci Code books are condescending, insulting, etc. This book has none of that. It also avoids the ""stealth evangelization"" that a few other books fall into--it simply presents the facts & the back-up.A quick read; easliy comprehensible. We ordered 10 copies!"
1,A Piece of Trash,"Richard Abanes has a bone to pick with The Da Vinci Code and he proceeds to lay out the biggest piece of dross I have tried to read in very long time. I'm not certain if it is because Dan Brown's novel threatened Abanes' worldview or for some other unknown reason, but he spends all 75 pages of his book skewering every little detail of The Da Vinci code as if the book was a personal attack on his own belief system.He has divided his book into primary concepts and then breaksdown each section by details and suppositions found in The Da Vinci Code. In many cases he wins at knit-picking, but loses in attempts to refute the overall concept (see the section on the history of the Bible or on Mary Magdalene).I made it only half way through before a tore the book in half, disgusted by boredom and the time I had spent trying to get a balanced view of the novel.Do not waste your time with this book when I'm certain any other book on the same subject must be money and time better spent!"
2,O.K. But lacking. Like fast food.,"I just wanted a quick response to Code Lovers, but this was to quick. This is perfect if you have a hard time with big words (none here). Also if you have ADD this book is quick enough to burn through before your ritalin even kicks in. Well worth the buck I paid for it ""used"". Best consumed by those that have time in abundance."
2,based on faulty syllogism,The crux of this books faulty premise is simply this....You can't use Christianity and/or the Bible to prove itself as it is itself unproven.1 star for existence and 1 star for effort.
2,The Da Vinci Code is fiction? What was your first clue?,"""This is recommended for those who don't want an extended version but just want to know, why is the Code pure fiction.""This is taken from a previous review of this title, and I have to say that since I found this book shelved with FICTION that was my first clue."
5,The best eraser around!,"Staedtler erasers are the best erasers that you can buy. I've used all types of erasers and these are the most reliable and long-lasting. These high quality white vinyl erasers will erase your lead mistakes cleanly and without blemishing your paper, which other erasers tend to do. When it comes to erasers this is the best brand you can buy."
5,awesome eraser for pencil drawing,I like that this takes off pencil marks without ripping up your paper. The white plastic material is soft and glides over paper rather than skidding on paper. It takes off the pencil marks without leaving any residue. I use it for pencil drawings but it would be great for writing too. The eraser has a cardboard overwrap that you can remove or leave on. I leave it on to keep the eraser nice and clean.
2,"Half the tracks are new recordings, not the originals.","I bought this title to fill gaps in my singles collection. Fortunately the ones I needed were the original recordings. The Coasters, Bobby Vee, Lloyd Price, Diamonds, Bobby Rydell, Conway Twitty, Jan & Dean are all new recordings. If you're not picky about your Oldies, go ahead and get it. The price seems right for the six tracks I needed."
5,"Great book (funny, witty, sad). Parents should read too.","I read this book to my daugther (9.5 yrs) during a long car trip this summer. We both loved it. It was very funny (Norbert, from Jupiter, has quite a sense of humour) but it was also sad as it addressed issues of kids suffering through a divorce, parents too busy for their kids, schoolyard bullies, confidence and self-esteem. We laughed at Norbert, cried, and then rejoiced for Alan when he learned how to deal with his problems. It is a wonderful book. I think that both kids and parents should read it."
5,There's an Alien up my nose,"I bought this book for my two sons aged 9 and 11. To get them started, I read the first chapter. Well, that was me hooked. I had to read the whole book aloud. For the next week, each night I had to read more than the usual length.I found myself crying with laughter at the alien forcing the little boy Allen out of his usual routine and behaviour. There are some hilarious moments as Norbert the Alien gets Allen into tricky situations he would normally avoid.The alien helped Allen sort out bullies and also to understand his mum and dad. All of these life lessons are given in such a positive way.My sons were invited to a birthday party and they asked if they could buy the 'alien up the nose book' for their friend - this one is a winner for kids and parents."
1,"Good book, HORRIBLE formatting",How anyone can put a book up for sale with the formatting as messed up as this is beyond me. I hope I can dissuade anyone from making the same $5.99 mistake I made - I've seen some bad formatting but this is so awful it's unreadable.Damn I want my money back!
5,A Childhood Favorite,"This book was one of my favorites when I was a kid...too many years ago to mention. Oh, all right then...40 years ago. I loved Susan Shaw and was so thrilled with her adventures. It is wonderful that this book is back in print so that more kids can run away to the past with Susan."
5,Never forgotten,"I have a hardcover of this book - first edition - and where my kids have long since destroyed the dust jacket, the book sits amongst other treasured stories of my youth. I loved this book so much, I 'borrowed' this copy from a friend and never returned it -- another story in and of itself. But the book haunted me, as did the transgression, and when I finally offered to return the book to her some 30 years later, she told me to enjoy the book and give it to my children! Few books today capture a child's love of time travel like this one. Read and enjoy Susan's journey."
5,I've been looking for this book for nearly thirty years.,"I never thought I'd find it again! Lovely plot, great characterization, a heroine you feel strongly for, and an unforgettable ending. By mere chance I found this title on a recommendation list and knew it was the book I'd half-forgotten. Now I get to recommend it to my nieces, nephews and someday my daughter!"
5,Love it!,"I read this book probably 30 plus years ago and was fascinated by it. I loved the characters and was pleased with the descriptions. I felt like I was there. Sill one of my all time favorite books. I have bought a copy of the book for my goddaughter and another for a friend. I only discovered the sequel, All In Good Time, last year. I was tickled that the story continued and had to buy three more copies, one for me, my goddaughter and friend. I was not disappointed. Now I see that the publisher has released both together. A smart move. My goddaughter, my friend and my mother have all read them both now and loved them. Bottom line, people of all ages, male and female alike can enjoy this book. P.s. better hurry, I'm buying more copies for more friends."
4,A far-out moment,"The first time I heard ""Going Home Is Just a Ride"" (The Lady with the Braid), I just left my wife and family on vacation in VT while I had to make a 250 mile ride back to NY in 1971 in search for a job. Didn't know anything about her or the song and it took several years after that, that I re-discovered it. I'm glad I did; the profound experience and her message has never been lost."
4,Good first book,"Somewhat slow going at the start -- especially if you are not into local politics. Once the action starts, though, it's hard to put down. The ending caught me completely off guard. Hopefully this author will be picked up by a more prominent publisher -- the type set is very distracting to the reader. Even so, I would gladly read his next book."
4,Interesting read,The basic story line of THE MORGUE is fascinating in itself. The author did an excellent job developing the characters so that you had a clear picture in your mind of how each looked and acted. It was certainly one you didn't want to put down because you HAD to find out what happened next. This isn't the type of book I am typically attracted to but I am glad I read it.
5,Columbo Strikes Again !,"Dennis Griffin writes with such ease that he makes the words flow.He tells his story in a very natural form without adding filler words as some authors seem to do, just to add pages. In his books The Morgue and Red Gold he keeps you on the edge of your seat with suspense, yet making you want and almost lust for more. Grffin brings to light some deplorabe human acts that may of and still can be done in this society, all for the sake of money, power and greed."
5,What a movie this would make!,It is very easy reading and a spell binding book. The author makes the characters come alive. I felt as though I was a part of it.
2,overpriced,The top is difficult to close! My daughter is 2 and can not close the lid. The Jack in the box is overpriced.
3,Not too scary,"I like this ""Jack"" in the box for what it is. It's not something that JUMPS out at my daughter and scares her, rather it's a ""softer"" pop out with a cute butterfly figure. This toy is great except the figure doesn't stay once you shove it back down into the box, rather you have to hold it down with one hand and shut the lid with the other. Not so easy for little hands to manage. I remember the JITB from when I was young and once you shoved it down it would stay. And then once the lid is on, if you haven't turned the handle all the way to the end of the song, the latch won't close. So after you get this dang thing shoved all the way down and are holding it with one hand and shutting the lid on the other hand make sure the latch latches! If not, turn the handle a couple of times. Also, I think this is a bit pricey for what you get."
2,dog likes it.,"My dog likes this food, but it doesn't agree with his stomach.so we'll have to try something else! Sorry for that!"
5,70's Jazz,"This might be a big turn off for the classic rock Santana fans but it's a pure joy for those who like easy going smooth jazz. Keyboards, flutes, etc. It's a 70's throwback.Enjoy!"
2,Santana goes Jazz Fusion,"This is NOT the beloved Santana of the original 3 albums he is mostly known for. This is a complete departure from Latin rock, and a dive into lite jazz fusion jam sessions.I didnt enjoy this album at all. It is too dated, the early 70's really do come thru here, sounds, lyrics, almost drugged out California feel to it. Some songs too short, others way too long. In all, this album is a collection of amateur mindless jamming; any garage jazz band in the 70's could've released this nonesense. Now imagine Santana releasing this one as their 1st album, would they have had any success or been recognized as one of the most influential bands in Rock?For hardcore, Santana collectors only."
4,Wonderfully colorful pages!,Jasper's story will draw you in behind the walls to a wonderfully colorful world of fantasy. I especially liked the towers in the ocean that made music with the wind. I look forward to the next one!
4,I found this a readable and title on the subject.,"I found this to be a readable refresher on the subject. I've recently had to write a number of papers for my employer advocating various positions. This Herrick does a very nice job of going over the basics. The writing is suitable for high school, undergraduates and business folk."
2,"Not Bad, Not Good","The Catfile collects Catwoman issues 15 thru 19. If you don't have those this may be a good buy. Notice I said ""may"". The story is not particularly good and Jim Balent's art, which is eye candy, suffers from the overuse of some facial expressions. Nothing worse than eye candy that gets boring. How many scowls, scowling grins or attack with the mouth open as if the person is yelling drawings does one need? If the last description is supposed to indicate fighr or flight heavy breathing the eyes are wrong. The originals were done in 1994 - 1995. I don't recall when DC went to the more glossy paper but this book is standard comic book (non-glossy) paper. As I said, this may be a good buy. Can I endorse it? No."
2,Wireless kybd and optical mouse,"Very nice keyboard, lots of usefull keys but I was having a lot of problems with the mouse, I had to star using the regular mouse I had been using for a long time. too bad!"
3,Super Scooper all over the place,"I have purchased this item at local stores in the past. In the interest of saving time (that is a valuable thing lately) and money (by not being tempted by impulse purchases at the store) I decided to try Amazon out on this. I have been using Amazon for years and have mostly good things to say. I will continue to make purchases through Amazon. That being said, this time the box of litter must have been bounced around during shipping pretty violently. The UPS driver delivered it to me with litter spilling out as he walked. Upon opening the outer shipping box, I found that the product box was split open and most of the contents were scattered about. I was able to salvage most of it for use, but will think twice before repeating this purchase."
2,Stinky Litter,"This is the smelliest litter I think I have ever had. Perhaps that is how the odor control is working... Regardless, I live in a studio apartment and my place is reeking of the litter. I wasn't having the same problem with another kind of litter. So, if you have a small place/location for the litter box and want to avoid a pungent litter smell, I would advise trying something else first. Just my two cents! Happy shopping!"
3,Wrong item sent,"I ordered the ""fresh scent"" catpan filler because that scent attracts cats to the pan and encourages them to use the pan. But the Arm & Hammer catpan filler I received does not have that ""fresh scent""--it is unscented. It is the same catpan filler I've been using in the back yard catpan. The outdoor cats ignore that pan and use my front yard as their bathroom, which annoys my neighbors. My neighbors don't like the smell.The only good thing about this order is it is the 14 lb. size--almost too heavy to lift. I wish the Arm & Hammer company would package 10 lb. boxes of fresh scent catpan filler. I wish they'd realize old ladies often live with cats and old ladies do not have very strong muscles."
3,use it daily,"I found it to be just okay, as is most of the arm and hammer litter. works about average for cat litter"
4,Arm & Hammer Super Scoop,"It is litter. It clumps, I scoop. What you would expect from this product. The dust level is not bad, we have had some that cover everything nearby in dust. This does not seem to do that. I will probably order again. For shipping the individual boxed came in a plastic over-bag in case of leakage. We had one box that did leak some so that is a good perk. the total order of 3 boxes came packed so poorly the outer box was practically bent in half due to the weight. The reason for this was they used a long flat box which could not handle the weight of the litter in it. I would hope they stop that practice."
1,"Poorly written, wouldn't make it as an high school paper",Bishop has taken a subject that could be exceedingly interesting and turned it into a dull recitation of facts and figures that in many cases are wrong or ill conceived. Your time would be better spent reading books on this subject written by George Stein or David Littlejohn.
4,A bit academic.,"I like to read about journalists so I will tenaciously forge ahead through the most boring biographies and find something worthwhile. I had the impression this book would be the same. It starts out slow and seems like the author did a lot of research and then tried to find a way to thread them together seamlessly, which he did not. Still, I found a lot to like about the book and it's historical insight into what truly was a golden age of journalism. A good biography should bring you close to the character, and this book did not. Still, I would recommend it to readers, even if you only end up knowing Reston from a bleachers vantage point."
1,An Incomplete Work,"I came to this wanting to understand American journalism at the mid-20th Century and how Reston helped shaped debates, policy, and writing. I left wondering the same questions because this book is a complete waste of time. If one is curious about how the New York Times defined moments in the 1960s and 1970s, a reader should look to Gay Talese's imperfect work on the subject. And, if one wants to understand Reston, Wikipedia is more complete (and free)."
3,a bit of a let down.........,"I don't know about anyone else, but this was possibly the most eagerly awaited DVD of the year, well for me, anyway.Whilst I love Jackass and can watch most of it anytime without getting bored, I was really looking forward to owning this DVD.But it is dissapointing, it's a bit of a let down for me, The 'bleeps' which cover swearing are still intact, and the fuzzy screen whenever there is nudity and [stuff] remains too, Now I don't really want to see male nudity, but I want the full picture, a chunk of the soundtrack has gone too, which dissapoints as some skits were really complete with the music.I love the show and all the 'guys' from it, but I may aswell have taped it from MTV... its no different.Also the volume one is missing, because of stupid kids copying it and lawsuits etc. I still rate the DVD because I rate the show, I can't wait for the movie, but I long for a complete collection with extras etc, in a nice deluxe boxset, like the cKY series."
2,Huge Jackass fan very disappointed,"I am a huge fan of Jackass, but am extremely disappointed. I was expecting extra footage, no bleeping of curse words or blurring of naughty bits, but no... these DVD's are exactly what was on TV & I already had every episode on tape. Now I'll be the sucker buying them again when the 'deluxe & uncensored' version comes out. It's still really funny though, so If you don't have them on tape or have never seen these episodes, then pick it up."
3,Not what I expected.,"A tad disappointing. It does not contain the flour eating segment as stated above. Missing A TON of great stuff (...Bam beating Phil, etc...) - glad I have VHS of a lot of the shows. Still funny. I assumed that is was going to contain more of the segments and maybe some unseen footage. Oh, well least I have some of it on DVD..."
1,Nearly got sick watching this piece of junk.,All parts are gross and NOT VERY GOOD. At parts i was gagging it was so gross. DON'T RENT OR BUY THIS MOVIE. IT IS NOT WORTH IT.THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR PEOPLE WITH A WEAK STOMACH OR MINORS.On the last note:PLEASE DO NOT TRY THESE STUNTS AT HOME OR ANYWHERE ELSE!
4,FUNNY! FUNNY! FUNNY!,"These DvD's are the best skits of the second and third seasons of JACKASS. Unfortunately they bleep out the cuss words, which is one of the reasons I gave these DvD's 4 stars.The special features on them aren't a big deal either. One of them is JACKASS QUIZ. Another is the CAST BIOGRAPHIES.If you've seen every JACKASS episode on MTV you've seen everything on this DVD already. But if you haven't, or even if you have, you should get your hands on these two DVD's. If you ever get bored, and want a good laugh, you can depend on these DVD's to get the job done. I guarantee you'll laugh ....Some of the skits on them are:* THE LOOP* THE CUP TEST* BOTTLE SKATING* FAT...2* GHETTO CARTS* HUMAN BOWLING& THE BOUNTY HUNTER SKIT"
4,hmmmmmmm....,"This is a cool wee set of Jackass Seasons 2 and 3, but there is just one problem. And it's quite a bad problem. They are CENSORED!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That sucks so bad that they're censored, but this is still a cool set for Jackass lovers. If Paramount & MTV won't come out with Uncensored complete Jackass seasons on DVD, then I guess this will have to do. Oh well. It does manage to keep you laughing long and hard though. Damn censors!"
3,Dissapointing,"If your looking for unedited Jackass this isnt it. All the cussing is still censored. They even change alot of the music they use on certain skits. Probably because of royalty issues.When I buy a DVD I dont want all the good stuff to be cut out,and everything is cut out.MTV should have put out two versions like there doing for The Osbournes,because this one isnt what I expected. But if you want uncensored Jackass wait for the movie to be realesed on DVD or get something from the CKY series, because this is the same as watching it on TV."
2,GoGo a no no,"When I received these boots I thought, ""oh finally!"" and they fit nicely in the foot but didn't even hold onto the calve, so they rubbed as I moved. Not only that, inside the heel the metal underneath it came THROUGH not even three months after receiving. The shine wasn't as it looks in the pictures and the material began to tear on the tips too soon. I'd suggest moving elsewhere and finding better boots. Metal in the heel for a few hours is nothing I'd want anyone else to have to suffer."
1,Only good for stork-legged women,"I was so excited when these boots arrived on Saturday, but was quickly disappointed when I tried them on. I do not consider my calves to be large (I am a petite 5'2"" and size 4/6), yet I could not zip up these boots. They are at least an inch too narrow."
4,Very comfortable,"Bought these for a crazy halloween costume. Although I returned them in the end (costume plans changed), they were pretty comfortable when I tried them."
3,Good boot - Fitting problem.,"I bought these boots as part of a costume. I'm a little bigger than some girls, but no where near bigger than most, so I bought a size up to make sure the calves fit. When they arrived, however, they didn't fit AT ALL. Luckily, since the sole was the right size, I was able to take time and stretch the top of the boot, being vinyl, so it's all good, but if you don't have the time or patience to stretch vinyl, you may want to reconsider.The color and shine were exactly as pictured for me, the heel is a comfortable height and width. Basically, except for the (fixable) sizing issue with the top, the boot is excellent, and a very fair price for the quality."
2,Interesting book but tedious and dated,"first the good: Ms Hamilton is very knowledgeable on the subject and provides a great deal of connection between the Classical Greek and modern thought. The book contains a great deal of food for thought.Now the bad. First, I don't really care for the writing style. This is however a fairly minor issue compared to a bigger issue: bad comparisons.You can't compare a good translation of Classical Greek (such as Pindar) in Modern English and say how contemporary something sounds. Of course it sounds contemporary, if the translator was any good... In fact, Pindar and Homer composed works which would be, on the whole, very different from what people write today. The focus on similarities, especially in translation, is quite misleading.On the whole, I think some people would get something out of this book, but I think there are far better works which address both similarities and differences."
1,Snore,"Indeed, the word ""school"" comes from the Greek word for ""leisure."" Therefore, this isn't a very good book for school, because there is absolutely no connection between ""The Greek Way"" and leisure. I had to read this freshman year in high school, and I had to force myself to finish. The most interesting part of the book is when the author goes into a detailed description about the Indian practice of chanting ""Ohhhm"". (Don't ask me what that has to do with Ancient Greece.)"
1,Not very clear.,"The Greek way is supposed to be a text-book supliment for those studying Greece to get some sort of cultural understanding. My European history teacher, Mr. O'Keefe, gave us homework assignments from it. The homework took a while, but I thought that at least we were learning something. Boy, was I wrong. The author of the book makes an attempt to be interesting, but fails miserably. The book is extremely over-generalized. The first few chapters have more about Egypt than Greece. The information given in the book has no use in life, and I see no reason why anyone would want to read it.I wouldn't reccomend this book to a friend, unless for some reason they had to read it (in which case I would feel sorry for them). If you want some interesting information on the Greeks, look elsewhere."
3,Not a lot of content but still a cute book,"This board book was good for my one-year old. He recognized the hat. There is not a lot of content though, and the only thing they really learn about Thanksgiving is pumpkin pie and seeing extended family. Oh, and the pilgrim hat too. But I'm not sorry I bought it."
3,Has its good points ...,"First, the bad news. The book has a number of typographical and minor translation errors, which are irritating to a native English speaker and probably confusing to someone trying to learn the language. Several of the phrases in the book are very rarely used and would draw odd looks from most people. The book redeems itself by providing decent translations and examples for several of the more common ""slang"" expressions, and might prove useful as a reference for somebody new to an English-speaking environment."
4,"Must to have, to utilize your old IDE drive in computer with SATA connections","The converter works well.If you have new computer that has only SATA power connections, you should buy from Addonics, in the same order, ""15-pin SATA to 4-pin Molex power connector"".Note that jumper setting on your IDE drive should depend on its function, i.e., master, slave or single. ""Cable Select"" setting works, as well, if your IDE drive has that option.Good luck!"
3,It works!,It works as advertised. Mine came with instructions as apposed to some of the other reviews. The down side of this adapter is the fact that it takes a god awful long time for the BIOS to detect the drive.
1,Addonics IDE to Serial ATA Converter,"The product does not work as advertised. On a PC with XP Media Center Edition SP2, the system freezes when it comes out of standby or hard drive shut down. Their support is terrible with responses like: 1) it should work; it is 100% compatible with an SATA interface and 2) we don't know why it does not work...sorry."
4,A good overview but a few cars are missing.,"Great coverage of TV's Batmobile and the Munter's cars. Authors also remind you about cars you didn't know Barris did: The Beverly Hillbillies truck, the Flintstones (film of course) cars, updates of the Knight Rider Firebird, the Jurassic Park Explorers, and the infamous sitcom ""My Mother the Car"" (the butt of many Johnny Carson jokes). But also taking up space are forgotten cars from forgotton projects...the Bugaloos dune buggy and a TV special ""Romp"". Cars I would have liked to have seen but didn't include the Stutz replicas made for the 1971 CBS adventure series ""Bearcats!"". Overall a good book, but I have a hunch that only the surface of Barris' career has been scratched. How about a large format book with lots of color and details on the surviving movie cars and ""Kustoms"" that made Barris the legend he is?"
5,Barris Batmobile Information,This book is a must for any Batmobile fan. It has lots of information and photographs about all the cars that George Barris has designed for famous people and for well known TV shows and films.
1,Lag and pointless,"The fact that it was USB powered and still was a source of phantom power is what sold me but when I used it on my PC, the lag time was remarkably annoying. I found myself wasting more time editting this product's mistakes instead of recording. Waste of money and time."
4,Versatile and Affordable,"I have had this unit for a good four years. It has worked glitch free with two different laptops and a desktop, all running XP Pro. Initially, I had major problems with the bundled software (Cubase LE). Ditched it and now I use Audacity. I work as a live audio tech and have used this unit to record performances straight off an aux send. I also use the Lambda to create mp3 versions from my vinyl record collection and CDs. Additionally, I have used it to record myself on vocal and guitar with the guitar plugged into a DI. Never a problem with any input source. I'm just a little bummed to see the price has dropped about 30 bucks since I bought mine. I deducted one star because of the software issues with Cubase."
5,Great Addition To Recording,Work very well attaching form sound board to my laptop to record concerts. Be sure to have a educated sound board operator to help you out with levels. Very sensitive.
2,Not great,"I was not highly impressed with these sardines. Not a great taste, higher in fat and lower in protein than the ones packed in olive oil, BUT they are lower in sodium than most. Amazon is still the best place to buy them, but just make sure what you really want first. The two layer in olive oil have a much better flavor and texture and they are not that much more in price."
4,perfect for the bristling sardine lover,"My local grocery store stopped carrying Bristling Sardines, No salt added, packed in water.This product is it!I prefer smaller sardines than this company packs; if it was up to me I would pack a smaller sardine and charge a little more. However there isn't any fault involved as these sardines came as advertised."
5,good quailty and value,Exactly what I expected from Crown Prince. Especially appreciate the low sodium and springwater packaging. A great snack to pack.
4,"Very tasty,","These are not the best, but the second best I have tried. Very nice on toast, packed in BPA free cans, so safer to eat than many. I think the Wild Planet sardines are better, but these a close second."
2,SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Okay, at firstI thought maybe it was me. Nope, i am close enough (8 ft). Yes, thjs does say it is accurate to 30ft. So, no, it isn't me. At first, I had problems with both the keyboard and the mouse, so I figured hey, it's probably the receiver, so I went to the place I got it from, and it they just exchanged the receiver. Great, the mouse works awesome. BUt the keyboard SUCKS. Maybe its the batteries........nope, thats not it either. Maybe I need to change the channel on the keyboard...nope thats not it either. All in all, the kb just sucks. Here is a short demo of me typing at a normal pace, about 40 words per minute:is is adem of the keyboard tying a senteene.Now, with my Logitech cordless keyboard, ""accurate to 5 ft,"" but sitting 10 feet away:This is a demo of the keyboard typing a sentence.Bottom line, DON'T buy the package, buy the mouse only. The mouse works amazing, maybe even more than 30ft and I love using it in the air."
2,Gyration Keyboard and Oversensitive Mouse,"I really loved the style and compactness of this keyboard/mouse at first, but then noticed after a few months how the mouse because so extremely sensitive. You can barely lay your hand on it without it clicking when you don't intend to click it.The keyboard is a little small for fingers (ok I'm 5'9"" so maybe it's just me) and honestly, I spilled an increment of water on the keys once, and about 2 or 3 months later certain keys didn't work anymore. That might be my fault (but I swear the water was barely a few drops). Also finally, the letter ""e"" sprung loose and the key sticks up, so I am unable to use it without repositioning it each and every time. I would say I am NOT the type of typer that pounds the keyboard either, not at all.So with all these problems, I am going to have to trash it, which seems a real waste when I paid over $100 for this unit."
5,Absolutely Wonderful!!,"This is a must read!! By far the best book of poetry I have ever read. Surfing the web, I found that this author also paints. Check his website: www.rudolphwkeehn.com."
1,Not working for me,After a few weeks of use this has not worked. I only have some small patches of psoriasis on my elbows. It has turned the patches an icky grey color but they remain unchanged. I'm sad and disappointed. I would really like to wear short sleeves again. :(
3,Oxipor,"Unfortunately, this didn't help my grandson't issue...but it's a very complex one. Oxipor is one of many products tried to alleviate symptoms. None worked until he switched meds for his Chrone's disease. Okay now!"
4,oxipor.. more liquid than lotion,Lotion tends to invoke the idea of a slightly THICKER preparation. It is as liquid as liquid gets. It works. I use this in combination with MG217 - which is WAY thicker - as well as several other OTC things. I combine treatments and have to switch frequently to and from things. But it does work. :)
5,Worked great for me,"I have bad eczema / dermatitis that was difficult to keep under control. This has worked great for me: my skin is almost back to normal. Unlike the prescription cortisone I was using before I can use this every day and I don't build up a tolerance (the cortisone worked for a week at at time but then became ineffective unless I stopped using it for a while).It's a bit messy to apply and I notice it does darken my skin, but that's way better than big red itchy patches!"
5,Psoriasis under control for now,"I have been using the Oxipor for about two weeks, once daily. It stopped my Psoriasis from itching after about 5 days. The scaling has reduced greatly. Time will tell if it continues to be effective."
2,Didn't work,"After using this product on my scalp for about a week, i noticed that it helped stopped the flaking but the itchyness didn't go away completely. I used it for about 3 more weeks and didn't really help get rid of my scalp psoriasis completely."
1,"ordered new, recieved used","I'm glad I have the product, but I paid for a new one, but I was sent a used one. Hope it won't happen again! It works really well on my skin."
4,A surprising workout for those who are chair bound,"This is a very interesting and easy to follow DVD that seems so simple yet really gives you a workout! The music and pace are very relaxing and I enjoyed it thoroughly. I haven't done the2nd workout yet, but if it's as good as the 1st one, I definitely got my money's worth out of the DVD's. Great instructor and the directions are easy to learn and follow even for an uncoordinated person like me!"
5,Best Dry Cat Food EVER,I have a cat that can't tolerate most dry foods since he has digestion issues and will end up hacking up a lot of hairballs and/or becoming severely constipated. We put him on this product in 2010 after a bit of research and he hasn't had any issues since! So glad a prime-eligible shipper carries this product online for the same price I used to pay at the feed store.
2,disappointed,"This is the first of her mysteries I've read, and I came to it with high hopes. The British paperback edition called her ""the Donna Leon of Istanbul."" alas, no. I made it about half way through and I still have her first novel on order, so I will try again. But she digressed too much for me, did not create enough sense of place, and her use of the word 'rather' as a modifier rather turned me off: I started counting them at some point, always a bad sign. Maybe a touch more editorial direction was needed."
4,Good features.,"Having a built-in weather radio is a great feature to have. I'm an avid outdoorsman & being able to keep abreast of developing weather conditions from you car is invaluable. Also, the radio has an automatic squelch control with the option to turn it off & go manual. The display is easy to read & has 2 illumination levels that are effective in most lighting situations. The sound quality is good even if you decide to mount the unit on the top of the dash (speaker grill holes on bottom of unit). Overall, I'm pleased with this purchase & would recommend this product."
5,Good Value!,"Needed to replace my badly worn pan and this one 'took the cake.' (Sorry couldn't resist the pun!) It's lightweight which is a bonus for me and anyone with arthritis in shoulders and/or hands. The pan is quite slick but I still grease as directed in recipes. One thing I really appreciate is that the coating is both inside and out unlike my older pan. I'm hoping this will keep it from peeling at the rim. Time will tell, but so far I'm more than pleased!"
4,Helped me through the first month of breastfeeding,"Breatfeeding can be painful for new mothers, as I found out. Lansinoh lanolin helps sooth and mosturize my nipples. I also tried samples of Purelan by Medela and Palmer's Cocoa Butter, but Lansinoh lanolin was best. My baby would not latch on when I used Purelan. The Palmer's product was the only one that actually felt soothing to my painful nipples, but I've heard and read that since babies ingest these products, only pure lanolin should be used. I had some dry skin that would gunk up on my baby's lips and lanolin stopped this from happening by mosturizing. Therefore, I suggest using it before your baby is born. The pain from breastfeeding subsides within a month, so one tube of these is more than you need."
5,Great Product!!,"This is one of the best products I learned about as a mom. My sister in laws told me about it. It really did help me while nursing both my kids. But it also can heal just about anything. I also used it for diaper rashes, chapped lips, cuts and scrapes. It is wonderful."
1,DO NOT BUY,"This guide is racist against the PS2 version! Not only that, but I have played and beaten the XBOX version at a friends house, and uncovered that there are various picture faults and the text wording is somewhat poor. Not only that, but some directions for the XBOX version are wrong, several wrong for PS2 (DON'T tell me to look in the ps2 sidebar, because thats what I meant.) This may be the last prima guide I buy."
1,Dumbness,"For those of you who do not have the time to work through this game, the guide is useful. But that also begs the question, ""Why did you even buy the game in the first place?""...So instead of using the guide take your time.FOR THOSE WHO HAVE THE GAME!!!!!!!!!!!While playing Splinter Cell I figured out some cheats.Hit the F2 key and then type HEALTH,AMMO or FLY. They do the obvious."
4,Good Concise Social History,"This concise and clear book is a summary of French social history during the Napoleonic period. Bergeron covers the structure of government administration under Napoleon, economic life, class structure, and elements of intellectual life. The underlying theme is distinguishing what elements in French society changed as a result of the revolution and what elements exhibit continuity. There is also a good and concise discussion of how the Napoleonic period set the stage for the social structure of Restoration France."
1,"No instructions, no hardware","The gap guards are nice, shipping extremely fast. 1st one they sent had no instructions or mounting hardware. They sent me a second one in two days. It to did not have the mounting kit. They emailed saying it didnt have one with it and the discription must have been missleading. Amazon has been very fast answering emails and questions and were very professional. Alowed me to return product if I wanted to. I contacted the manufacturer and they are sending me the mounting kit free of charge. Amazon should check the descriptions of merchandise alittle more carefully. Over all, they are good quality gap guards and I will keep them. I will order from Amazon again, they have great customer service."
1,Not All Original,"Several of the recordings are definitely NOT the originals we heard on the radio in the 1950s. Pat Boone's ""Love Letters in the Sand"" is an ""alternate cut"" that never made it to the air. Gene Vincent's ""Be-Bop-A-Lula"" sounds like a re-recording in a style 10 to 15 years after the original. Fats Domino's ""Blueberry Hill"" is a concert recording with a crowd yelling in the background. The Platter's ""Only You"" is also a later-day re-recording when their voices weren't fresh anymore. The two CDs are not total rip-offs. There is some good stuff on them but many of the songs are just not the originals. I know. I was in Rock and Roll's first generation, 1955 to 1964."
3,Beautiful writing... but what else?,"This book is beautifully written, with descriptive scenes reminiscent of O'Keeffe paintings. However, I did not find it to be successful fiction. The characters are opaque, while the plot is slight and rendered nearly incomprehensible by the confused time sequence. I finished the book asking 'What was the point?'"
3,"Overrated, didn't meet my expectations.","Many vivid descriptions made this Pulitzer Prize winning novel very difficult to follow. The omniscient narrator moves back and forth in time, describing the troubled life of Abel, the central character. It becomes very hard to read as the author bounces back between stories of whom you are not sure he is talking about. Amidst all of the difficult reading, however, is a very clever story line. Momaday uses a variety of narrative strategies to tell stories of the characters. Many exotic descriptions are used when describing characters and scenery. Recommend reading if you have the tensions span to do so."
2,Interesting,"I read this book for my book club. I have long been interested in Americal Indian culture and arts. I was very excited to read it because of my interest. However, I found the book dissapionting. I think it degrades the American Indian and makes their culture a bunch of misfits and complainers. I do not see this as accurate. Every culture has it's problem people but it would have been better and more interesting if the author had not presented the characters as typical of the culture, which I do not think they are."
3,A boo-tay kickin' novel. I dropped a load.,"I can't say this was my favorite book, altough some partskept me entertained. -George McCleary"
1,A book worth reading.,"In Momaday's Pulitzer Prize winning novel ""House Made of Dawn,"" a young Native-American Indian named Abel, returns to Walatow Reservation in New Mexico from World War II. Only to discover that he is caught between two worlds. This book is a great example of Native-American fiction, it reveals the hardships of the Native-Americna people. Anyone who loves a good book based on storytelling and myth will find this book a must-read. It draws the reader in, with it's vivid description of the landscapes and ceremonies. At first I was a bit apprehensive in reading this book, because I have been told this is not a good book to read if you're reading Momaday's work for the first time. Yet, I enjoyed reading it, I apprieciated Momaday's effort to draw the reader in with the struggle of Native-American Indians living in industrial America. I recommend this book to anyone who is in search of a good book."
2,for an experenced reader,most multicultural books are hard to understand because of the amount of symbolizm but in the book. I found this once to be espetially hard. Because not only do you have the symbolizm but you have it told to you in the form of visions and dreams. Over all I enjoyed the book.
2,Depressing to Say the Least,"This book was assigned as a college reading assignment for an American Literature course, so I knew right off that I wasn't in for a real literary treat. The criteria for a reading assignment are: a main character must suffer and then die, and language and plot must work to confuse the reader. If you're looking for an entertaining read, do not choose this novel. If, however, you are looking to read something for the sole purpose of telling others that you have read it, and wish to brag at dinner parties and other things of that nature, this is probably the book for you. Personally, I like to believe that I have better things to do than read something that is depressing, boring, and poorly written."
3,Beautiful prose that is difficult to follow,"The strategy with which this book is written is unique. You will not know the background of the story until the very end. You will bump into so many characters because the author switches narrations from time to time. *House Made of Dawn* tells you to a journey of a Native American named Abel who struggles with drug and alchol problems. He lives in two worlds in which he battles constantly for his true identity. The narration switches back and forth between several characters throughout the novel. The main story line, which is of Abel, intertwines with all these characters. From time to time, you would have to slow down and back trek to see if you have missed something. The first time I read I got lost in the midst of all the different characters, contending to piece the whole story together. Once you have surmounted the intricate relationships, the book is a charm. Beautiful prose. 3.5 stars."
4,Visionary but challenging,"Interesting book which was re-released 1999 -- put in the context of late 60's it was a watershed novel. Now it is still beautifully written & evocative of the 40's & 50's -- through an Oliver Stone type jump-cut imagery. Glimpses of characters' thoughts and motivations are interspersed with native american cultural history as Abel loses his soul in modern America. Difficult to follow unless you give yourself up to stream of consciousness type thinking & appreciate the spiritual message. This is a tragic story but well worth reading, I think."
1,Seattle Sports Pack Sink Collapses,"I had purchased this sink to take on a camping trip. Everytime I put the water in it, it would collapse on one side or another and the water would come out. I tried tying the handles to keep it from collapsing but that didn't work either. The only thing I can think of to keep it upright is maybe put some heavy duty plastic tubing in the bottom in a circle to keep it standing up right.It is collapsible, but you better have a partner to hold it open while you rinse or wash anything in it."
2,Seattle Sports SInk,"Not to happy with this purchase, doesn't hold up to holding much water. It will hold a couple of inches, but that's it. Can't wash dishes.Would not recommend this product."
1,disapointing camp sink,"I bought this to take as a rinse sink on a recent camping trip. When filled with any amount of water suitable for rinsing/wasing dishes, it does not hold its shape. It also leaked water. The one great thing about it is that it folds up really small for camping. Sacrifice the compactibility of this and buy the Kelty Camp Sink."
3,Does not hold much water,"Once you add too much water the side walls will begin to sag. The design is functional if you are really limiting your space concerns, but if you are car camping go with a ridge container."
2,Low budget...,This movie is low budget lame. I really was expecting more. I guess you get what you pay for...
1,Wish I could give a lower rating!,Blah!!! Don't waste your time or the time of the person who would have to deliver this trash to you!!!
5,A must own dvd,I have the first season and I cant wait until the second season comes out. I have been waiting a long time since i got the first season. So I do recomend this dvd to anyone who likes this season
3,Knight Rider Season 2,"I too am missing the extras on any of the seasons. Universal has to open the vault to all the extras and behind the scenes action. I am also very dissapointed (like others) to find that the disc's skip very badly. I thought it was my own DVD player until I tried it in other players and even my computer, and it did the very same thing. The double sided discs have to go, but I guess all the seasons have been made now so it doesn't matter. I would be willing to pay more money for single sided discs, and hope that Universal thinks of this for future releases of any TV show on DVD. All in all, it is Knight Rider, and I grew up watching it, but the quality of teh discs need to be better."
5,Sheer lunacy!,"My favorite season of Knight Rider for probablyall the wrong reasons. Just watching the episodeGoliath will bring uncontrollable laughter.There really is nothing better than watchingDavid Hasselhoff playing his evil twin, Garthe.The sheer campy nature of these episode(s) makesthis volume (he reprised the role in Goliath Returnsin even more silly performances) a must-have forevery DVD collection."
3,"C'mon man, WORK!!!","I love the show. Always have. I own every season. It is great to own a piece of my childhood again. The problem? Every season has at least one ""problem disc"" that has trouble playing (if it plays at all) in whatever DVD Player I put it in, even my computer."
5,Knight Rider - Season 2,"It is worthwhile to get. David Hasselhoff proves himself in his acting abilities with the premiere episode. On the otherhand, I miss Bonnie but her replacement is alright. Bonnie does eventually return in the series. Season 2 is just as good and sometimes a little better than season one."
4,"Great episodes, but are the discs defective?","It's great to see Universal bring this entire series to DVD. However, does anyone else who owns the Season 2 collection have issues with the discs skipping/pausing in their DVD players?My player is about a year and a half old, and these are the only discs I've ever had problems with. (aside from scratched rental discs) I'm getting episodes on both sides of each disc that mysteriously have choppy playback. (strangely, they are fine in the DVD-ROM)Any ideas why? This is actually the second set I've owned. The first had the same problems and I exchanged it in the store, but to no avail. Was there a faulty batch of DVDs manufactured by Universal?"
3,"Even though season 2 had 2 extra episodes, 2 suffered a bit!","David Hasslehoff returns as Michael Knight... Season 2 suffered a bit... I was critical about the series losing Bonnie for April, but I give it three and a half stars which Amazon.com doesn't allow, because of David Hasslehoff's Double role in the 2 part Goliath! K.I.T.T. VS. Semi - How cool is that?! Plus Michael VS. Garth Knight - Evil twin brothers indeed! (By plastic surgery of course!) Wilton Knight's son Garth is the real son, and Michael is the son he always wanted. A tale of Irony... Season 3 & 4 gets 4 stars! 3- Bonnie returns! YES! And 4- Super K.I.T.T. - even more cool... Plus R.C. Is cool...I also wanted to comment that another review I read by someone here thought Season 2 had Goliath Returns... Not true... That was season 3... Good try though... I have official complete series print out, but not updated in my computer files to share yet, sorry, only Season 1... I am a slacker! (Forgive me?) -JM"
4,Season 2 is awesome!,"The 2 Goliath movies are worth buying season 2 alone, and lets not forget the talking car K.I.T.T. Sadly to say the voice of K.I.T.T. died in the late 1990's. They were planning to bring back David Hasselhoff and a new Knight Rider, but without K.I.T.T. I doubt the series would last very long, plus Devon Miles was murdered, and there is no Bonnie, so what is the point? I love the classic 4 season Knight Rider shows as they are and even Knight Rider 2000 was good. Let it end here please! Here is an episode guide for season 2...23- Movie: Goliath24- Brother's Keeper25- Merchants of Death26- Blind Spot27- Return To Cadiz28- K.I.T.T. The Cat29- Custom K.I.T.T.30- Soul Survivor31- Ring Of Fire32- Knightmares33- Silent Knight34- A Knight In Shining Armor35- Diamonds Aren't A Girl's Best Friend36- White-Line Warriors37- Race For Life38- Speed Demons39- Movie: Goliath Returns40- A Good Knight's Work41- Movie: Mouth Of The Snake42- Let It Be Me43- Big IronHope this review helped!"
5,Even better then you remember,I'm totally hooked on these DVD's. They're so entertaining and D.Hasselhoff is so underapprecieated as an actor it's rediculous. He carries this show on his charismatic broad shoulders and you can tell he loves this character in every scene. There are also SO MANY episodes per season it's mind blowing. Season One had 22 hour long episodes whereas today's dramas only put out 9-13 tops and not nearly as fun to watch.I give this show a resounding 2 thumbs up.
1,Warning. This series is not really from Playboy,Warning. This series is not really from Playboy.Can't find anything about this series on the Playboy site. Contents not related to the genuine Playboy casting call features in the newsstand special editions or on the Cyber Club.Part of the new gonzo video series from some company that Playboy bought.Not the girl next door. The women are exotic dancers or something who are not very attractive. In most segments they are posing for a photographer while being filmed by a video cameraman. A few segments are audition videos in which they awkwardly talk about themselves. Editor doesn't even match the color when they jump between the two video cameras.These women have no chance of getting in Playboy. This should not be under the Playboy name.
3,A good read but not definative ...,"James Couzens was a liberal Republican progressive that ended up in full support of the New Deal. In general he stood for what he believed in and didn't take direction from any special interests. The book makes it seem like he was truly a public servant but others tend to dismiss him as an mean-spirited and cold man. The book is definitely dated and had surprisingly few details about his personal life or how he actually accomplished what he did. Depending on how important his career actually is in US History, I think someone should take another shot at a biography of him."
5,Outstanding,"This book portrays a man who contributed to the strength of the United States. It should be a ""must read"" for all high schoolers."
1,Counterfit Pet Tabs ?,"We've been buying Pet Tabs for 15 years in the name brand stores and depend on them to provide our dogs the vitamins they need for health. Although the container looks real enough from the Pet Tabs purchase we made on-line from Amazon, the actual tablets aren't the same texture we've been seeing for 15 years. Was the reason they were $15 lower in price that these tabs have passed their shelf life ? Normally pets gulp them down like favorite treats but our normally ravenous black lab mix takes a bite and promptly spits it out (for 2 weeks now). Reading the label these ""new"" pet tabs are made in an overseas location I question. Do they want profit but forgo the quality ? I've had good luck with books and a GPS purchased on Amazon but for real products and health items I'd advise sticking with the real store you can walk into. Is there any way I can get a refund on this product ?"
5,art of war,"its a really good book that i invested in . such great work , such a legend classic ! 5 stars"
1,Sad Decline,"I must be the only one who is pining the decline of the NYRofBs. To my personal choice, it was the only periodical worth reading (my subscription to the New Yorker died long ago; talk about a waste of trees). Now it's not worth buying. I used to love reading the paper with a passion, but it's been all politics; literature is not even a consideration. I couldn't care less about politics, I subscribed for the literature reviews. But the last few years you'd be hard to find anything worth reading. I even wrote to the editor who responded that he, too, was sorry for the prevalence of politics and promised that there'd be more emphasis on literary reviews. That was last year. My subscription runs out soon and thats it for me. I'll re-read Shakespeare, Melville, Wordsworth, Milton, and etc. and wander through the rest. Magazines themselves used to be works of Art..."
3,some pretty good reviews in here,Just have to say that if you are looken for good reviews you will find some here but not all of them. If you are looken for Roger Ebert DO NOT go here he writes reviews somewhere else I think it is Entertainment Weekly but do not quote me on that lolalso i read a funny review of monsters inc but i could not find it here i do not remember where i read it if you know where it is please send me the link
5,Let's get NYROB on Kindle,New York Review of Books is the best publication in the United States for serious readers. But as any of us who have them stacked up for years know they we need to get it on Kindle. What's the delay?
5,K-L Industries 12 ' Jon Boat,Took the boat out last weekend on Strawberry reservoir in Utah. I'm 61 years old and can put this boat in the back of the truck bed by myself. Great craftsmanship went into this small boat. It has available four rod holders an two places to put your electric or gas motors.
4,light weight jon boat,"we were very pleased with the jon boat, it was in the water as fast as we could get it unpacked. we wanted to check for stability, and that was fine, even while rocking it(just in case of waves). we will be taking it on vacation to florida, we wanted a light weight boat for fishing we could put it on top of the truck. and this will work great. only reason it did not get 5 stars is that there are no handles in the back."
1,Not the boat for a decent Viking Funeral,"We got this for Uncle Leif's funeral. We did not know it was plastic- It and the durn Green coffin kit we got were not up to the job. After we got it(the coffin) assembled (6 hours)and uncle Leif on board,we poured in some coal oil and lit it off.(As an after thought , maybe we should have used a little kindling) All we got was a slightly singed uncle and a melted boat, not the glorious send off he had requested. He loved Viking movies. Tony Curtis was his favorite. Long story short, the boat melted down to the waterline way before we got the anticipated results. Next time its the Aluminum John Boat and a case of charcoal starter and that cardboard coffin too."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"Used this for the first time to mask the woodwork in my house. Lots of bleed thru issues, resulting in me having to clean paint of the woodwork. Not good!"
5,10ft USB cable,This item arrived on time and in good condition. The cable is made of good material and for the price you can't go wrong. I would recommend this item to all.
3,NOt my ideal cable,"I can charge my phone, my mp3 Player, my tablet: with this cable but the only thing that this cable does not work for my laptop computer."
2,what is this cable for?,I was buying this cable to try to connect two computers! It did not work that way. Further research that you can't do that. It is against the USB specs. So it has to be a computer and a peripheral but I never found a peripheral that has male-connector! Can anyone show me one?Why did they create such cable in the first place?
1,dog bowl,"It is a very small bowl and only has a rubber ring that you have to put on to keep it from sliding on the floor (this is why I assume they call it a non-spill bowl). It has nothing to do with no-spill, if bumped it can spill and the dog can still figure out ways to spill it. The bowl has no spill resistant rim and should not be considered a non-spill bowl. I feel as I've been taken on this product and the manufactures or promoters are giving out false information (false advertising). It's not worth my time to pursue this anymore. If you're looking for spill proof dog bowl's, look somewhere else."
4,Nice but small,"This are nice dishes for your dog. But however, the picture may be deceiving. These are very small and should not be purchased for large dogs"
1,Studies with no ecological validity,"Though Garb offers the kind of enticing indictment of clinician reasoning that was once favored in the so-called biases and heuristic literature of the 1970s and 1980s, the review of studies in this text lack the kind of ecological validity that would have made a difference by now in our understanding of clinical reasoning. Because these studies, more often than not, display clinicians taking part in chess-games, puzzles, and mutliple-choice questions, all in an effort to show how clinicians are prone to error in clinical reasoning, the text offers the reader no sense whatsoever of how clinicians actually reason in real-time clinical settings. The absense of this ecological validity - that is, the absense of displaying clinical reasoning in real-time settings rather than in having clinicians play chess and observing their reasoning - it is this absense of ecological validity that robs the book of its claim to importance."
1,The pages aren't square,The pages of my calendar are not square. They measure 145mm X 147mm. 2mm might not sound like a lot but it makes a big difference in the final product. This product is likely to turn beginners against origami. It is like trying to teach someone guitar on an instrument that is out of tune. The end product will never be good and the student will become frustrated.
3,"Great idea, but...","I'm a big fan of origami, so I was really looking forward to using my calendar. It really does have a huge variety of fun things to fold. However, the pages (on my copy of the calendar, at least) aren't exactly square. They come very close (mine are less than 1/16"" off) but this difference is enough to make folding difficult if you're trying to be precise. So I'm rather disappointed by that. But if it doesn't bother you that the models probably won't be perfect due to this, then this is a great calendar."
5,They got the mustard sardine thing right with these!,"Hint, if you don't like them cold, microwave them for a few seconds and take the chill off. The taste sensation then is very different.Firm sardines with a very balanced mustard sauce! That's about it. Nice job Crown Prince!"
3,"Ok, but definately not the best sardines","I used to enjoy Crown Prince brand when I was growing up, so I went ahead and bought the 12 pack since I'm trying to increase my daily calcium intake.I found the sardines to be a bit too ""mushy"" and the vinegar in the mustard to be quite overpowering. Also, one of the five boxes I opened so far had already partially split along the seam where you peel off the top and some of the contents had seeped out, suggesting possible spoilage. It certainly isn't safe to eat from that can. I plan to contact Crown Prince once I finish the twelve pack in case any more cans are partially open.I'll finish this pack, but I don't intend to buy any more of the Crown Prince in mustard and will experiment with a different brand instead."
