2,A Big Disappointment,I bought the Kindle to enable me to carry around my collection of documents and books in pdf format. The kindle does'nt handle this format very well. The biggest problem is of font size as no zooming of the document is possible. This renders most of my file completely non-readable. I attempted to get a file translated by Amazon to the Kindle format but was disappointed to learn that they do not do this for Canadian locations. I wonder why does Amazon advertise the Kindle so much on their Canadian site when it cannot be supported properly. As a great fan and loyal customer of Amazon I am thoroughly disappointed as for me the money I invested in the Kindle is totally down the drain!
3,"OK, but Look Forward to Improvements","I like reading but don't like the idea of giving up books altogether. I got the Kindle for one main reason: to be able to highlight and to make annotations and notes, primarily on non-fiction works. Therefore, I'm struck by the primitive technology that's offered. Why not a more user-friendly keyboard? The Internet access via my computer is welcome--but why not allow that access to be used for editing annotations? It would be great to be able to sit at my computer and use its keyboard for that purpose.I get the idea that Amazon stinted on the annotation/note capability in the belief that getting books easily downloaded and having access to a a large selection of books, newspapers, and magazines were the main consumer demands. Are there others out there who would like more emphasis on improving the highlight/annotation capabilities?"
5,Kindle II,"The Kindle is wonderful. Easy to read, easy to purchase books, easy to carry. It is amazing."
4,Excellent For Now,"I love my Kindle. It was a Christmas gift from my wife, and I absolutely love it. Benefits - easy & fast to navigate, easy & light to carry with you (I have the 6"" smaller size version), fast to download, great range of books & newspapers/magazines to try out or subscribe to. I love the Sample feature that enables you to read a sample of a book's chapter before buying; or a two week trial before subscribing to a periodical. The screen is easy to read. It has a four day battery life that is helpful on long trips. It's better than Nook that's slow & difficult to navigate. Main drawback - black & white screen. This is where the Ipad may draw away customers unless Amazon does something about this. There's got to be a happy medium between color screen and still pretty good battery life.Kindle Wireless Reading Device (6"" Display, Global Wireless, Latest Generation)"
2,Why NOT to upgrade from Kindle 1 to Kindle 2,"1. Solutions in search of a problem- improved battery life; but battery life was not a problem- thinner; but thickness was not a problem- more storage; but storage was not a problem2. Shortcomings carried forward- background is too dark- no way to organize large collectionsIn short, the Kindle is a great product; but there are no good reasons to switch from your Kindle 1."
2,Previous Comment on Limited Flexibility - No Longer a Problem,"Since my first review, The Bible has been put in a format for ease searching. The problem I cited below no longer exists.I was excited to receive my Kindle 2 and download The Holy Bible. I ended up being sorely disappointed. One cannot zero in on a Book of the Bible. I was looking forward to taking my Kindle 2 with me in my travels and using a larger font for reading than I have in my printed Bible. With the Kindle 2, I have to read from beginning to end (Genesis to Revelation) without going to Books or Verses in between. Bookmarking doesn't help because I cannot name my bookmarks. I am very disappointed with the Kindle 2's limited flexibility. I would have expected the Kindle 2 to be at least as flexible as [...]"
2,Bad battery life,Nice device but find that battery dies after about 4 hours of reading and 4 days of being idle. Having a tough time trying to find Kindle support.
1,I am used to owning my books.,"Once upon a time there was the possibility to choose a book, love it and own it. The DRM-ridden Kindle is giving away this possibility. I would really love a similar device but letting anyone too much control on what I read is simply unacceptable. It is obvious that the only way for Amazon to gain money from the Kindle is to sell it at a right price and then super-charge the books and keeping the users from copying and exchanging them, the same heading of the music majors. And, like the music majors themselves, Amazon will discover that the smart user, the one that buy more books, wants more freedom, not less.If you value usefulness over freedom then buy it immediately, it is great! For the rest of us, no thanks."
3,What is a Kindle,I would really like to buy a Kindle 2 for my wife. However Amazon does not seam to want to ship this item to military overseas. So thanks for your support Amazon NOT. I am going to buy a Sony E Book now.
3,college student,"This a very good invention But , I need to use it for my college text books.So when are You ( Amazon) going to include college text books on the Kindle book list? It would so much easier to carry this instead of all those text books to-from classes and to do all that homework assignments."
4,I like my Kindle,"I really enjoy my Kindle. Its easy to purchase books and have them right away to start reading. My only complaint is that alot of books are still not available from certain publishers. but on the flip side there are alot of books that you can get for no charge or a very small charge. over all I like the product. I like the thought of saving trees by not using paper. The battery lasts a long time and so far I havent had any problems at all, but I have only had it for about a month."
1,young readers/teenagers books - poor availability,"I bought this specifically for my 12-yo son to use. He is an avid reader, loves technology - so I thought, excellent present, combine the 2 and he'll be even happier to read.The problem I'm finding is the lack of books available for his age group - and not one of his favourite writers is available through kindle. Rather disappointing - but hopefully not forever.."
3,Overpriced Books,We are happy with the quality of the device and the convenience of the technology. However we have found most of the books we have purchased cost much more than we had been led to believe before purchasing the Kindle 2. In fact some new releases can be purchased in hardcover from WalMart or other major retailers for about the same price. Until both the cost of the Kindle and the price of the books come down I would not recommend purchasing a Kindle 2.
3,I am sadly disappointed,"Hi,My Kindle would be perfect, except for the new OS download, that gives the ability to turn off the computer's ability to read to me.This was a selling point that brought me to make the purchase, and now it's disabled at the whim of the publisher. Not fair Amazon. I'm sorry I purchased it. I use it for study mostly, and that feature gave me the ability to hear and read together, which penetrates my thick skull more effectively. I'm disappointed."
5,I LOVE MY KINDLE!!!!!!!!!!,Since the Kindle first came out I've had my eye on it! This was my birthday gift and I ABSOLUTELY love it!!!!! So convenient to have all my books in one place and not have to carry them around is so great for me. It's sleek and very easy to work. And the user guide was a great help!I would warn against buying covers though from other companies other than Amazon. I bought a red leather cover and it was so big I don't use it anymore. I was told that Amazon's cover fits more snug and is a lot better. I will try to return the case but I wish I'd just bought the Amazon.Kindle cover from Amazon. But other than that I LOVE MY KINDLE! Barnes & Noble's Nook and The Sony Reader both have nothing on the Amazon Kindle!!!!!Thanks Amazon!~Lakeisha Bing
4,BUY IT!!!!!,"im just gonna write a simple informal review, so here it is. the kindle is AMAZING, no way else to describe it! everything they promote, it not only does, but does it well. im currently deployed in iraq and although im out of whispernet coverage, it hasnt been a problem, cuz i just plug the kindle into the computer and download books directly to it. its great because instead having to wait for the book in the mail i get it right away! some of my friends have other types, like the sony version, i always give em a hard time and show all the features that the kindle has that theirs does not. the only problem which is temporary, is the vloume size of the kindle library. not everything you will find is there, but it is temporary as the company is continously adding books. a GREAT INVESTMENT BY FAR!"
2,READ THIS BEFORE BUYING,"Anyone interested in buying a Kindle should first review the following articles before buying a Kindle so that they fully know what they are buying.http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/27/technology/companies/27amazon.html?_r=1http://www.slate.com/id/2223214/pagenum/all/#p2The books are not yours, they are merely rented copies and can be deleted at any time without prior warning."
4,price change on books,"I just orded and received a Kindle. I love it. However, I bought it because Amazon said all books would be 9.99$. I wanted to order the newest Jodi Picoult book and it was 16.00$. Amazon wrote and told me the publisher set the price. Amazon never ,in all their advertising, mentioned the publisher pricing. I feel I was lied to."
1,Amazon can remove your files.,"Pretty sweet screen, but even though Amazon apologized for doing so the fact remains that Amazon can remove your files. I wouldn't recommend this product if your intent is to buy books for it."
5,Kindle,"I love my Kindle....It is so easy to carry with me and just start reading. Downloading books in just seconds, your place is saved each time you stop reading, it is so light, no bigger than a small notepad. The only disappointment I have is the price of the downloads....I thought I would be saving more with the Kindle than purchasing the books which isn't true. You do save, you don't have to store the books, but the savings just aren't quite there. I have maybe saved $ .50 to $1.00 per book I have downloaded. But I would buy it again.....and I will continue to download books. I just wish there was more incentive to downloading rather than buying books. Another thing, downloading books can add up pretty quickly if you don't watch it......"
4,Great reader if you don't use the text-to-speech,"I am an avid reader and received the kindle from my kids for Mother's Day. I absolutely love it! The only downfall is the text-to-speech capability which leaves a lot to the imagination. The voice speaks in a monotone and mis-pronounces words and names. There is no enunciation when listening to the story. Other than that, I love the fact that when I go on vacation, I only have to take this 10 0unce reader and no longer have to take 3-4 heavy books in my suitcase! I would recommend it to anyone who loves to read! Downloading books is very easy and the choices are plenty!"
1,Not sent!,"This item was not sent -- my funds were returned, but I was not notified that the item was not being sent. The vendor did not respond to my emails questioning when it would be sent. When I received my credit card statement I found the credit. The item was a gift and I did not have the opportunity to purchase a replacement item since I didn't know until after the fact that the item was not going to be sent."
2,for US only,"I was very disappointed to see that the Kindle's wireless connection is not available outside the US. Getting newspapers and magazines, in addition to books, when I travel abroad was the main reason I got it. I still decided to keep it, it does what it's supposed to do well, but I need to connect it to a computer to download anything."
3,A Bit Disappointed,"I like the fact that I can download five books and carry all of them in my purse but I was disappointed with the archaic technology of the Kindle. Considering what you get on an iPhone for less money, I was surprised that there's a toggle switch rather than a touch screen. Also, that there isn't some sort of filing system for purchases. I wish I had waited for the technology to catch up."
3,Good product,My review would have been stronger but I have been unable to access the Bible that was downloaded.
3,$300?????,"$300 is ridiculous when you think about what this product actually does, yes the kindle is a sweet innovative product but when you think about the new PS3 slim coming out at only $300 and what that does compared to what this does its absolutely absurd."
5,Kindle 2 Golbal reader,I first purchased this device for my Mother for Christmas she loved it so much and I found I wanted to read more so I also recieved one for Christmas we both LOve this device.
3,Seriously missing something,I LOVED my Kindle when I first got it. Now I've discovered a reason not to like it so much. My public library has begun to offer e-books. For every reader it seems EXCEPT the Kindle! Must be proprietary software that won't allow it. When I first started downloading audio books from Net Library they did not download to i pods. That has been changed. - So Kindle - how about it?
5,kindle,great product purchased for a gift and to try it for myself ! she cant put it downnow have to buy my own !!! a++++++
5,Great tool!,I'm loving my Kindle. Easy to use. I'm afraid I'll spend more on books now because it's so easy to buy a new one.
5,Kindle Rocks!,"I travel by air twice a week, and became increasingly weary of lugging books around with me. Since the holidays, I have been evaluating the different ebook readers. I am pleased to say that the Kindle is superior in quality and performance to the others I have seen. I am totally pleased with the aesthetic quality of the device, and with the superior service from Amazon."
4,Newest Kindle,"This new and improved version of the Kindle is everything it purports to be. It is very easy to download new books and to use. It holds more books than the original, and the pages turn slightly faster.I particularly like: the re-sized and re-named buttons, and the ability to change font sizes so easily. Now I don't need my reading glasses!Things I'd like to see improved even further: a larger area to hold onto without accidentally hitting buttons, and an elastic strap on the book cover, like the original cover has. Oh, and the book cover is now an extra cost item."
5,"Love it, LOVE it, LOVE IT!!!!!","Love it, LOVE it, LOVE IT!!!!! More than you'll ever be able to read in the palm of your hand and so much more! The books, the newspapers, the magazines, surfing the web. The MP3's to listen to while you read is a big plus. Now you have something else you should not leave home without!!"
1,"Amazon owns it, you don't","Amazon broke into the homes of thousands of its customers the other night and retrieved copies of George Orwell's ""1984"" and ""Animal Farm."" (Read about it in David Pogue's NYTimes blog posting from July 17, 2009.)In so doing, Amazon has given an object lesson in the fatal flaw of its Kindle: it is a proprietary technology which they control, not you. You do not own your library. You own nothing but a few ounces of plastic and circuitry. And, years from now, regardless of what Amazon does to your library in the short run, your long-obsolete, long-dead Kindle will sit on an empty bookshelf, a reminder of what Big Brother did to the publishing industry."
4,Kindle 2,really like the Kindle - fun new way to read. The ease and efficiency of shopping in the Kindle store is great. Would suggest a backlight to use when reading in bed with a sleeping partner rather than having to attach a light to it
4,One of the best technological devices I own!,"Love the fact that I can easily read newspapers, news magazines, and books in such a thin, yet convenient and comfortable device. Thank you."
5,Kindle 2: Amazon's New Wire Reading Device Kindle 2,"Love, love, love this item. I take it everywhere. Great to have muliple books in one device, It can go from newspaper to books whenever."
4,Kindle User in HK,"I am generally satisfied with the product. My son also enjoys reading it a lot. The strength of this is the Over-The-Air purchase and delivery. This eliminates the hassles to connect to the computer the get the purchases transferred. However, this is also where I find some disatisfactions with. I don't know whether it is a regional issue or not.For the connection, it is not uncommon that I have a problem with the wireless connection, sometimes there is just not connection. And when the Kindle is connected, mostly it is just GPRS. When I purchase a book of larger size, it sometimes really needs a long time to download OTA, I need to download to the PC then transfer via the USB.And I hope the price of the books would come down more as the cost of printing/paper is now saved."
5,Best Gift Ever!,"My husband bought me a Kindle for Christmas. Out of every generous and beautiful gift he has given me, this is my absolute FAVORITE! I am an avid reader, and a stay at home mom and I just love that I can download books with touch of a button. I can't write enough good things about this product. I used to frequent the public library, which, being free of charge, is obviously less expensive than buying novels to go on my Kindle, but it is still less expensive than pay for the actual book. I literally download three novels at time and read and read and read every chance I get- mostly when my son is asleep!"
1,Faulty Kindles...,"Well,... I have returned three faulty Kindles (second version) within 9 months of ownership..On first two,.. there was bad charging connection,... so sometimes has been charged sometimes not,... At third one,.. display faded 30% white, 30% black. Readable portion has been confined to bottom 30%,... Now I waiting for shipment of fourth one...The unpleasant reality is that with any new Kindle your subscription magazine issues are lost,.. Kindle doesn't keep the context,.. and there is also no way to do backup it on your computer... Knowing that I will definitely hold on buying Kindle,..."
2,Kindle in Need of Apple engineering,"I appreciate the ease of buying books (though too many are still not available as ebooks) but find the handling so last Century. I wished it would work more intuitively like a well designed i-phone with Touch screen that allows turning the page like in a real book . The kindle is a useful tool for traveling, I like the Dictionary and Wikipedia for easy cheching while reading. Lots of Potential - but please, give it to Apple engineers to transform it into a userfriendly, well designed reader. I also wished Booksnön-tape could be downloaded more easily. The fact that I could Not receive my NYTimes while travelling abroad was very annoying.I still prefer Books and newsoapers over their electronic Editions but see a promising Future for readers. The kindle needs a major overhaul and pricedrop to become more userfriendly. I-Book where are you."
2,planned obsolesence,"I eagerly awaited my Kindle 2 and when it arrived was anxious to become acquainted with all the features. To my utter dismay, I discovered that unlike the Kindle 1 the entire unit must be returned to Amazon to get the battery replaced - At considerable cost, I might add. This is unacceptable, especially for those of us who are housebound. If this feature had been mentioned anywhere in the advertising hype, it would have made me decide not to purchase this unit - but then that was the plan, wasn't it? To have to pack, wrap and find a way to mail the unit back to Amazon is impossible for me and probably nany other readers. Now I realize too late, this is simply another money making gadget to entice gullible consumers like me. Extra charge for the cover, extra charge for the battery replacement, extra charge for extended insurance......Shame on you Amazon."
3,kindle good / book prices bad,I like the device itself BUT the prices of the books are going up and up. Many of them are over $10 and SOME PAPER BOOKS ARE CHEAPER THAN DOWNLOADS! That is disgusting!!!!!!
3,"Book Selection in Flux - Good reader, but availability of new titles dropping","I'm a pretty big fan of the Kindle as an e-Reader (and the option of picking up my place on the Kindle iPhone app when I don't have the kindle with me is great). However, one of the big selling points was supposed to be selection, and now because of disputes with the publishers you'll run into situations like a New York Times bestseller (e.g. Changes, by Jim Butcher) that is available to UK customers but not to US customers. The selection of older titles has also been disappointing, although maybe that will change once they come to an agreement with the publisher."
4,global friendLIEST,it may not be touch screen but its the global friendliest..very important to somebody who travels a lot like me. wireless service in europe and asia.
5,Ruth's Review,I love my Kindle!!! I can't think of one thing that I don't like about it. I've told everyone I know that if they love to read they should get a Kindle. I also love the experimental features. Going online to look for something without going to my computer is outstanding!! Thanks
5,24 hours and I love it.,"The Kindle is very cool.Notwithstanding the Apple Corps members at my meeting last night who assured me that when Apple comes out with its tablet computer, it will kill the Kindle. You know who you are. Problem is, I don't agree with you.The point is, I don't want this damn thing to be a full-fledged computer. I want to read books on it. It doesn't have to be a Swiss Army Knife solution.So far the only thing I dislike is the position of the HOME and PREV PAGE buttons. I would prefer them reversed. Sadly there is not even a software setting to do that.I also understand that there is no way to organize books into folders, which when you think about it is pretty damn dumb, but I knew that before I bought the device.Bottom line, it's a hell of a lot better platform for reading e-books than my Treo.Nice job, Amazon."
5,Absolutely amazing.,So many words have been said and written about this incredible device.So I can only say that the Kindle II is absolutely amazing and I strongly recommend it.The effect of the e-ink is so real that I often forget that I'm reading form an electronic device.So many pros and almost no cons.Sometimes my Kindle II due to the extensive use gets a little slower but with a simple reset everything gets back to normal speed.No backlight? Who cares!! Wouldn't you turn on a lamp on your nightstand to read a regular paper book? So keep on doing that.
2,Canadian Buyers Beware,"If you live in Canada, I would advise you to consider twice before ordering a Kindle. Firstly, you will not get free delivery as US customers do. You will pay $21 shipping and handling. On top of that, you will be charged a mysterious and pernicious ""import fees, deposit"" of $31. What happened to free trade?It is easy to buy books on Kindle. But when I tried to use the other features that sold me on the device, like the email and document management I received an email on my computer from Amazon notifying me that, ""Personal Document Service is not available in Canada. We look forward to making this service available in Canada in the future but aren't announcing a timeline today."" And of course, they won't accept any replies.So far, this Kindle has succeeded only in disappointing me. To Canadian residents anyway, the Kindle is much less than it is a made out to be and is improperly represented."
4,Kindle2 for Canadians,"I really love my Kindle2. I have had mine for a few weeks and it is really small, light and easy to read. The problem that I have is it isn't really user friendly for non-Americans. I had my Kindle2 shipped overseas via a friend's address in the US, only to find that I couldn't use it without an American credit card and billing address. Luckily, I have a friend who was willing to lend me their credit card. So that my friend is never charged, I purchase gift certificates and apply them to my Amazon account. It works but it leaves me reliant on my friend's generosity, which is inconvenient. While I love my Kindle2, my friend bought a Sony E-reader and he seems just as happy with it. I find it frustrating that my Canadian credit card is good enough for paperbacks but not for the Kindle books. My suggestion would be to look at buying a Sony E-reader if Amazon doesn't bring the Kindle to Canada soon!"
4,Trying to do a little too much?,"Overall, this is a wonderful device for its core competency--storing and displaying books and magazines. Retrieving materials via Whispernet has largely gone well, although I live in an area with marginal Sprint coverage, so I have to make sure I'm near a window when downloading content at home. The screen is much easier on the eyes than reading text from a backlit computer screen, and my eyes have reached the age where the adjustable font size is greatly appreciated.The additional, ""experimental"" features, however, are not quite ready for prime time. The text-to-speech capability is off in its pronunciation of some words just enough that I find myself lagging a split second behind in my comprehension as the reader surges ahead. A bit like trying to follow an excited ESL student in a conversation. I've found the Web browser to be pretty clunky and pretty dodgy in its ability to tackle tasks like displaying Gmail messages.Overall, though, I'm having fun!"
2,Kindle fails electronically..,"I have purchased 2 Kindles..1st generation and 2nd generation...both have failed to function..the first failed in about 17 months the 2nd generation kindle failed to function in 9 months..the screens stop working..you can't fix the problem the kindles are useless..Amazon has a poor replacement policy..out of warranty you pay $98 to replace the 1st generation with a ""reconditioned kindle"" with a 30 day warranty..with the new 2nd generation Amazon will replace it with a reconditioned kindle with a 30 day warranty...extremely unfair..they are not honoring a true warranty..keep in mind I have paid Amazon $758.00 for these inferior machines..incidentally I am a major customer..look somewhere else for a reader...obviously I also lost the cost of all the downloaded books.."
2,"Nice idea, but mine has broken 3 times in 14 months","I love the idea of the Kindle and I have read a whole lot of books on mine. The problem is that I travel extensively for work and the Kindle just doesn't survive the rigors of traveling in a laptop bag - even with the leather cover that I purchased for it. 2 times the screen has broken and once the power switch stopped working, and now that it's more than 12 months after it was purchased my warranty is up and I just can't see myself purchasing another Kindle based on my experience so far. At least if I purchased another one it would get a new 12 month warranty but paying $150+ every 12-16 months for a new Kindle seems a bit steep to me for a product that just shouldn't break this much."
1,just not reliable,"Yup, the same as many reviews I have read, all goes well for two months, then k2 gave up the ghost, vertical lines horizontal lines, strange happenings. took no books to Africa, just my kindle...big mistake, did get a refund after three months though...but kindle..never again"
3,Love it...but...,"I do love the Kindle, but I have a Sony eReader that manages the zooming of PDFs better. The Sony enlarges the text in a manner that allows me to view the text, mind you the images disappear but the text is enlarged so I can read it easily. The Sony does Not make me move from a portion of a page to the other...it enlarges the text so I can read it in sequence (does that make sense?).The Kindle is beautiful and light and I love the wireless ability to load new books and the ease of adding documents through the USB connection. My only issue is the inability to zoom only the text on a PDF. So I will hang on to the Sony for my PDFs."
5,Kindle review,i love this product. I have read 2 books and absolutely love it. I do not have buyers remorse like i thought i would. The battery life is unbelievable too.
3,OK but doesn't replace a book,"I have been using my Kindle for 6 months now and would make the following assessments. On the ""good"" side, it is great for when you are traveling or in the gym. It is also very convenient to be able to have a new book downloaded and be reading it within seconds. Also great for reading subscription-type material eg the daily newspaper from England. Screen visibility is also excellent and mine has had no hardware or software problems.On the ""bad"" side....I don't have the book to stick on my bookshelf for decades to come. The price of new books (now inflated) is becoming mismatched with the value of an electronic version. If I can have a hard back book to keep for posterity for $25, I'm not paying $14.99 (or even $9.99) for an e-version unless I really need it quickly.$5 is about right for an e-version considering there are absolutely no publishing or distribution costs. Unless the prices come down the Kindle's life is very limited"
1,It didn't work!,"We learned, after we bought it, that we were not in a zone where the wireless function could operate. Therefore, we had to return it."
1,Big Brother's pet device that can remotely delete your library,"1. When you buy a Kindle, Amazon controls it, not you. They can enter into your Kindle and delete your books at any time.2. They recently deleted hundreds of readers' copies of 1984 without their permission (I'm not joking, Google ""Amazon 1984"").3. Amazon's software allows them not only to delete books at any time, but also to cripple them -- as they did recently when they disabled the ""read aloud"" Text to Speech feature on already purchased titles.4. Amazon refuses to clarify what exactly their DRM system can do, or how they will or won't use it. Deceptive advertising practices like this are currently being looked into by the Federal Trade Commission. Notice that there is no mention or warning of DRM on the Kindle page.For more points, see [...]"
2,Avoid Kindle in Australia,Great product - but the poor availability and high cost of books for download in Australia is a problem. Before you consider buying in Australia (particularly if it is a gift) check the availability and cost of books. They are up to twice the price of books in America in $US before the exchange rate is considered.
5,Kindle 2,"Just love it!!! I was swayed by some negative reviews but finally ordered a Kindle before three back-to-back trips. Turned out the negative reviewer just didn't know how to work the Kindle. Do read the instrux that come with it. Hints are also available on the Kindle Daily Post. Easy to read, especially when flying coach. Easy on the eyes. Easy to download a new book in Boynton Canyon, AZ, where no one had cell phone service. Truly a joy. And what can I say about cost? More than the library; less than the bookstore. Don't hesitate to buy this product."
5,Tell me about the pictures. I want to know about them,"First I love my Kindle.Now I want to know about the pictures that come up when it goes to sleep.Who are the artists and what is he trying to convey, especially the picture with the skull in the window. I of cource recognise the pictures of the writers, but where did the other pictures come from?Thanks"
4,General charasteristics,"I have gotten great pleasure from my Kindle, though, with hindsight I wish I had purchased the larger DX version. The Kindle is easy to use, but the buttons for my big, clumsy fingers are way to small. I would also wish there were more explicit, idiot-proof instructions on its operation. On a scale of one to ten...you get a 9.5!"
3,Buyer beware- The Kindle is FRAGILE!,"I had my Kindle 5 days when I dropped it about 2 feet. I now have an ""etch a sketch"" I had to pay $200.00 dollars to get a new one (or refurbised one.) Get the warrenty because it will cover for 1 accident or be very careful. This is the reason I only gave it 3 stars. I love the Kindle, but I think for the amount of money they should include a cover that is shock resistant. I also think of this as a design flaw- something that should be addressed in future Kindles. HANDLE THE KINDLE WITH CARE, DO NOT DROP IT!"
1,Adapter wire eroded on my Kindle,I can no longer charge my Kindle because the plastic has come off in large chunks exposing the wire. I've had many electronic devices and this has never happened before. I'm not sure if I got a defective product or they were all made cheaply.
5,"Kindle free 3G, 6"" with full keyboard","I purchaed the Kindle DX while my mom purchased the Kindle 6"" with the full keyboard. My DX has faster access to different sites and information, but I prefer using my mom's little 6"" because the keyboard is much more user friendly. Also, my mom's vision requires her to increase the letter size to where the DX is better for her and she isn't into typing reviews and such like I am. With most of the newer versions, a fixed keyboard seems to becoming a thing of the past. I hope not. It's one of my favorite parts. I'll continue gett the small 6"" as long as the full fixed keyboard is available."
5,Kindle 2 review,The Kindle 2 is the best invention since the iPod! I absolutely love it. The size is perfect to go wherever I go. The selection of available books is wonderful. There isn't anything I don't like about it.
5,"""WOW""","Don't ever try to take my Kindle away from me......What a powerful piece of equipment this is. I am amazed each time I turn it on. I usually wind up giving a demonstration on it everywhere I go !! People are so curious when they see it. I bought my first book about 10 minutes after I turned it on for the first time. The book was downloaded before I could blink..... I have been a member of a bookclub for over 30 years, and I have cancelled my membership. The only people that will be disappointed are the ones I lend books to. I tell them to buy a ""Kindle"" and get rid of their bookcases!!Take my husband, take my dog, but please don't take my Kindle...!!"
4,Kindle review,"Generally easy to use. Comfortable to hold, downloads work quickly and well. Reading is almost like holding a real book and certainly much easier for traveling than packing a couple of dozen paperbacks or, worse yet, hardcovers. Writing on screen is crisp and easy to read. No backlight so you need a light source to use but this is not a problem. Reasonably large collection of books to chose from in my field which is sci-fi. Prices to download are comparable to buying the book so that is not a problem. May be overtaken by new technology coming out this year but, for me this is the best of the ebook readers available now."
2,sent back,"I got this for my husband for xmas, mainly because the 'read aloud' feature swayed me as we both travel a lot in cars and listen to audio books. He discovered that the majority of the types of books he listens to cannot be read aloud with the Kindle due to authors wanting you to purchase the audio book. He asked me to send it back. I think the feature should have further clarification."
5,Love it!,I love my new kindle. My hubby got it for me for my birthday and it is great =) Perfect to hold onto and I love that the page turn button is on both sides so no matter what hand you are holding it with there is no changing hands or putting down your coffee to turn the page =) Best thing I have bought in a long time. Now I need to order my kindle cover to protect it. Right now I am using the box it cam in and it's just not very portable but once I get my cover my kindle will slide into my purse and be perfect for waiting at the doctors office =)
5,Kindle Lover,"I purchased this item because a wonderful friend referred me to the Kindle. This is fantastic!!! I have downloaded 3 books already and thought this could be a bad thing cause it's so easy now to just go to Amazon Kindle Store and buy away. The Kindle is simple to use, great for around the pool and there are no more bookshelves to have to fill."
5,Awesomo,"Husband loves it. Hes on the road alot, plugs in kindle in car and listens over his speakers."
5,I bought a new book at 3 in the morning!,I just got the Kindle 2 a few days ago and I am in love. As an avid reader I tend to buy a new book once a week. I often find that I will finish a book up late at night and want to start a new one and the Kindle enables me to browse and buy a book at anytime of day or night.It's a good conversation piece alot of people have asked me what it was and are shocked when they discover that the wireless service is free. The price of the device itself is the only drawback but if your an avid reader like myself the reward far outways the price.So easy to use even my mother who can't do anything on the computer was able to pick it up pretty quickly.Just wish it came in a different color then white!
3,Kindle Killer: Apple iPad,"Unless the Kindle Reader price drops drastically ($99 or less), the new Apple iPad will destroy it.Why you ask? Think about it....why would you pay $260 - $300 for a device that just provides you the ability to read books when you could spend a little more to get a device that does that and much more. With the track record of Apple's smaller devices (iPod and the iPhone) the community around the devices has created more applications than you could ever imagine.In my humble opinion: The Kindle device will sell, even as they drop the price, then it will die out. I do feel sorry for the people who buy one."
1,Remote deletion,"Like many others I would like to register my complaint that Amazon has the ability to determine what will remain on a piece of hardware that I have in my possession. Let us get sensible about this, no matter what legal frame you want to put on it, building in such a function is on the same level as as a real estate agent holding onto the key of a house after it had been sold because the company may need to fix defects."
3,The B&N Nook is a better product,I reserched a lot before buying my ebook reader the B&N; Nook. Three major reasons I went this way are as follows.1.Expandability I can a sd memory to my nook to expand it another 16gb.2.The battery can be replaced by the user very easily.3.A format that is in use by many other ebook readers epub so if the business changes hands or goes under it is still viable. And less chance of abuse by the originator.On a side note it is cheaper and more adaptable (open format). I expect to see apps out for it soon as it is based on android already new wallpapers available.
3,KINDLE 2 LOVER,"I GOT MY KINDLE 2 LAST WEEK AND IT HASN'T LEFT MY HANDS, ITS GREAT. I FOUND IT EASY TO USE AND AM SURE THERE IS LOT MORE FOR ME TO EXPLORE. DOES ANYONE KNOW WHERE TO GET THE EARBUDS, LIKE THE ONES IN THE DEMO, THEY DO NOT SELL THEM ON AMAZON. THANK YOU."
5,I loved my kindle,"I would highly recommend a kindle to anyone who has a love of reading. Mine lasted for 3 years, with many books read on the device right up until I dropped it yesterday.Oh well, time to buy a new one I guess."
5,I'm thrilled!,"I just recently learned of the Kindle from a friend who owns one and thanked him for sharing the info with me. After researching the product and purchasing a Kindle, I again expressed my thanks to my friend! I am part of the senior generation who loves to read and have found that Kindle reading is easy on the eyes. The option of reading a chapter of a book before purchase is a nice perk and I have utililized it several times already - purchasing the books most of the time. The only negative with Kindle books is the amount of time you spend making a selection if there is no specific title you are interested in securing. Another good reason to enjoy retirement. The Kindle has been highly recommended to my friends."
5,I love my Kindle!,"The Amazon Kindle-2 totally rocks! It's more convenient and easier to use than an actual book! No bulky library taking up my shelf space. Simple to operate. Light and ergonomic. My one and only complaint is that all of my favorite books aren't available for download at this early stage in the game. I hope that Amazon's goal of making ""every title available for Kindle"" soon comes to fruition. If you're at all on the fence about making this purchase, let me assure you that it is well worth the investment! Order one today and you'll soon be saying, ""I love my Kindle!"""
5,Loooooove it!,"I love gadgets. This is one of my favorites. To think so many of my books are trapped in this device is mind-boggling. I like to read ten books at a time, depending on my mood of the moment, and switching between them now takes only 5 seconds. My husband, a non-book reader, never understood why I needed to have such a large stack of books next to the bed. No more! Now all he sees is this little device. No more clutter. :) One of the books I try to read almost daily is the Bible. Curling up with that large book was never easy. Now it is a breeze. Life is GOOD!"
1,Stay with the Kindle 1,No SD card and no user replacable battery. Giant mistakes. I'll stick with my Kindle 1 or move to the Barnes & Noble Nook.
2,Watch your Kindle charges closely!,"Keep a close watch on the charges for your Kindle. I've been double charged for one book, and charged two months for USA Today and never got an issue. After calling about the USA Today, they said they didn't know where to send it!! (But they sure knew where and how to charge it!) Customer service was quick to credit the mis charges, but I think 50% of the people won't even check their charges.Other than that, the Kindle itself is great. My wife now has one device instead of 100's of books around the house and in the car."
3,"These Things Are Wonderful, But Still Too $$$","One day these will be so affordable that everyone will have them. Paying three hundred dollars or more, however, is still a bit too expensive when one can buy a full notebook computer with hard disk, USB ports, keyboard and memory for about the same price, or less. Yes, they're convenient, but they're also a bit fragile and oversized. They're nice while in use, but I'd like to see them just a bit smaller and about $99.I read off a portable Windows Mobile device that fits in my hand and contains an entire library of books. When not in use it fits on my belt. The Kindle isn't so big that I wouldn't use it, but it needs to come down in price and, hopefully, just a tiny bit down in size as well. It also could be a bit thicker just to add a little more bulk to it. As it is, it's a bit too fragile.For those who can afford it, it's nice to have, especially if you have it about the house and don't have to carry it much. It's an astounding idea, though."
5,Beats Books,"The Kindle is convenient, and easy to use. The purchase of new books, newspapers and magazines is a cinch. It is easier to hold than a book and the variable font size make it easier to read than paperbacks with small print. I'd recommend this product to anyone who is an avid reader."
5,Love it!!,"I just received my Kindle a few days ago and I must say that I love it. I ordered specifically to download my school books to so that I can read while at the gym. My kindle was up and ready in less than two minutes and my school books were downloaded in less than 5, and I was ready to go. I read tons of reviews and did not find a lot of information regarding downloading PDF files, but it was so easy and it works out perfectly for me. Instead of wasting a ton of ink and paper, and having to carry around a binder, I just downloaded the chapters onto my Kindle and can read anywhere. The Kindle is so easy to use, it was a great purchase!!!!"
4,Kindle 2,I bought this to take on a 12 day trip to Italy.I charged it before I left and then turned off the wireless.I read most everyday and still had half of the battery life left without recharging it at all !!!! I love not having to hold the book open.Being able to increase the font was a big reason for buying this...you know as we get older.I think it is a great product and would recommend it if you are thinking about it.I bought it before the price dropped and was able to get the refund without any problem.Thanks Amazon !!!!
5,Love it.,"I love my Kindle. I have been using it for over a month now and really enjoy the convenience of it. So far, the only thing I would change is the lighting options. I find myself using my book light more than I would like. I bought an Oberon cover, and absolutely love the cover as well, very beautiful and extremely well made."
3,"Could be better, but hopefully the competition will help",The contrast in figures leaves much to be desired: the background is too gray for us olders folks to read in twilight. Placement of figures is sometimes off order.
3,KINDLE IS OK,"The Kindle is a neat toy but I hoped for more.The pros - Light weight, easy to read lots of content and easy access.The cons - No back light, other than a reader it is useless.Some day I hope the Kindle will have additional uses such as address book, internet access, touch screen, able to play games.I travel for a living and this will alow me to reduce the weight in my back pack but that is all. Granted if not for the $300 in gift cards from hotel points I would have been very disaponted in the Kindle for the price. The books are not much cheaper, I hope in the future that will change as well."
4,Great upgrade,"The smaller turn the page buttons help, I like the new size but wish it came with a cover like the first one"
4,"Great, but can't download in Europe","The Kindle is great in United States.Went on trip for two weeks to Europe and only packed one other magazine. Only problem, you can't download any new books, magazines or newspapers there. I was planning on getting a daily English newspaper everyday, and none could be delivered. So no news for 2 weeks.I read a lot about Kindle before I bought it and never came across this issue. Beware, if going overseas, get the books or magazines you need now downloaded to your Kindle."
2,Problems with Kindle 2,"For the first two weeks after buying the Kindle, I enjoyed using it, especially the ease of downloading books. But then I suddenly noticed that a part of the screen seemed damaged, obscuring some of the text. There did not seem to be any scratch on the surface of the screen, so the problem must have been internal. I followed the online instructions for returning it (fortunately I kept the shipping package). When I dropped it off at UPS, the clerk mentioned that about a dozen Kindle 2 devices had been returned during the past week, so this is apparently a production problem. Despite this setback, I'd like to get a replacement, once my account is credited (although I'll do this only if I can download the books I'd already purchased)."
3,Kindle2,"Love the size, shape and weight of my Kindle. Kindle store is sometimes confusing to use while shopping /searching for a book or author on the Kindle, but easy on my computer. Have not been able to figure out how to organize the books on the kindle by what I have read and what I still have to read. Can I organize them by author? Not clear if I can do this."
3,Please DO NOT sell international version to your customers again.,"I am a user from Taiwan. I have just bought the Lonely Planet for India and Nepal before chinese new year, for intalling on kindle for PC.Please convince your publishers selling the original version to people beyond America. DO NOT sell 'international ' version ever again at the same price with original version. It is NOT a honest way for business, otherwise , users will leave from you to choose other market product at our own world.Sincerely, a user comment"
2,I'd like to return my kindle.,"After hearing about all the publishing companies complaining, and, Amazon relinquishing titles, I expect Amazon to honor our request to return our newly purchased Kindle. What looks to be happening is Amazon is going to let the publishers charge a lot more money for new ebooks. One of the main reasons I bought a Kindle was to get a break on the costs. Now that you are raising your costs to us I no longer believe Kindle is worth its high price. You cannot find most of the current releases. The lag is incedibly annoying, and when some do finally become available the books can be found in used bookstores for a couple of bucks. Where is the upside here?I could use a pep-talk from Amazon right now on these issues and the reasons why I should consider keeping it. Hopefully it will not be ""you bought it, you own it""."
1,Horrible Product!!!,"This has been the biggest disappointment imaginable. What a terrible experience. I called Amazon when I had difficulties with my 1st Kindle. Amazon sent me a ""replacement"" Kindle. That was nice. It would have been nicer if it would have actually worked properly. I have had the same issues with the second Kindle that I did with the first one. These are both the same (original Kindle) models. Perhaps the later models have improved. I will not be taking that chance."
1,Return to sender,"I'm told this item was on my wishlist. It was not, but the advertising for it led the giver to believe it was. I am told the Kindle reads PDFs, if it does, it does not do so easily. For the price of this thing, I just assume use my laptop.You'll be getting my Kindle back Amazon."
5,Great choice!,"I have had my Kindle 2 for about three or four days and I'm enjoying it a lot.I will continue to buy some books on paper. I especially enjoy hardcover books. - I also like being able to resell books I have purchased via Amazon.com Marketplace and I can't do that with Kindle purchases.However, the advantage of being able to carry around so many books at once is undeniable.The screen is very clear. The device is thin, yet substantial. Looks very sleek.You can adjust the font size and that's very important to me.I went to a Barnes & Noble before I bought my Kindle and I looked at a Nook and was not impressed. I like the Kindle much better."
3,not sure?,"When I first turned it on, thought everything was fine, Buying my first book, I noticed that it started freezing up?"
4,I love my Kindle,"I love the ease of downloading reading material from anywhere. I love the fact that many of the books available for Kindle are free. I've had my Kindle for a month and I've already read 5 books at no cost to me. I love the built in dictionary and the ability to take notes on the books I'm reading.There is one thing I wish the Kindle had; it needs an internal light source. I know, the battery would run down very quickly if it was internally lit, but I would prefer to have the option to plug it in and read in a dark room, in bed, etc. if I want to.Other than that, I love my Kindle."
5,kindle reader,"Pop 10 books in before a vacation and no more lugging heavy, bulky books around. It's bedtime and you don't have a book on the nightstand? Browse, select and you're reading in minutes(or less if you already know the book you want to read). No more ""I don't have my next book on the nightstand"" anxiety!"
5,"Love, Love, Love it........","For every book lover out there this is ""it"". I love reading my kindle at the pool, at the beach, in my room. I have not had any problems with glare or lighting issues. This reads like a book so you do not get those tired eyes from looking at computer text. My husband and I fight over who get possession of the kindle, we both love it so much. You get books in a flash. If you are reading a serial book and want the next installment just buy it and it is there in 60 seconds or less. It can get addicting so keep track of what you buy. Have fun reading, you won't want to put it down."
3,Do your research!,"I love my Kindle1. As a device it is really cool and allows me to read to my hearts content. The only downside is that it is not back lit. So if you read in a shared bed or other darkened environ, you will need an extra source of light. For me that is no big deal.My complaint with the Kindle is recent, since Apple released their Ipad. The e-book prices have gone up. The prices difference between the printed editions and the e-books has narrowed considerably. In some instances it has become negligble. That has been a huge disappointment. I like the notion of being green and getting a deal for it. I guess next step for me is the used bookstore. I hope Amazon protects the interests of its customers in the future."
2,So irritated with Amazon,"I know this review is going to generate a lot of back-lash towards me, but I am just so irritated with Amazon that I had to express my frustrations somewhere.I have not even had my Kindle for a year, and now they are coming out with one that is better, with a better keypad, better contrast, and lighter weight? I am so irritated that companies don't let consumers know there will be a newer model product in less than a year. You think you're spending your money on something good, and then you find out that ""Oh, by the way, after you purchase yours, there will be a better model"".Sorry to vent, and hope that this does not generate a lot of backlash. I wish I never would have bought this thing and had decided to get the Sony Reader. I paid over $200 for my Kindle and it is not even touch screen. WHAT WAS I THINKING?"
3,Screen Froze After 3 Months,"I got Kindle 2 as a Christmas gift and I brought it to Iraq for easy, travel friendly, compact reading. The battery life sucks! When it's ""powered off"" there's a screen saver on the whole time which makes the standby time terrible (charge lasts less than a few days on standby/power off mode even after a full charge and no use). After only 3 months of having my Kindle, which was protected by a hardcase the whole time, the top 1/4 of the screen froze and now permanantly reads ""Critical Battery Life"" (basically telling me to recharge) which stays there when I open a text. You can't really read the bottom 3/4 of each page of an entire book, can you?! I will return Kindle 2 and wait for reviews on Kindle 3. Oi, Kindle I still have great hopes for you! This will one day be a great product once Amazon fixes the big complaints and lowers the cost."
3,Killed by iPad,"The Kindle would be a more attractive eBook reader - if not for the fact that the iPad stole their thunder.Kindle:- Uses ""digital ink"" - basically a higher contrast monochrome display. Can't be seen in darker situations.- Activates display via buttons.- Displays primarily text documents.- Books can be ""heard"" through translation into text.- Kindle limited to book applications.iPad:- High-contrast, color display is easy to read, night or day.- Activates via touch display - more intuitive and simpler to use.- Displays text, movies, video.- Books can be acquired as an audiobook, as well as displayed text.- iPad can be used to listen to mp3s, enter and read text, and play a variety of apps (many free).In truth, it's not fair to compare the Kindle and iPad - if only because they're completely different devices. The iPad brings the eBook reader to a new level. If you get the chance, use both - and you'll discover how the eReader has progressed."
1,wow is me,"My kindle stopped working for no reason after 2 years. It was never dropped, never left outside, never put in the sun or rain. The screen started freezing up so I called customer service and the told me what to do and then one day it just stopped coming on at all so I ordered a new batterie for 19.99 on amazon and charged it and my kindle still did not work. So I called customer service and they told me I could buy another on for 100 dollars because they don't have a repair department to fix it. I am so dissapointed because I love my kindle but I don't want to spend 100 to 200 dollars every 1 to 2 years because that is all the longer they last. The idea is that you save money because the books are cheaper but in reality they are not because you never get the return on the product. Come guys just because it is electronic does not meen it should not last longer REALLY!!!! I love the idea but the lifetime is terrible."
5,luvmykindle,"I purchased a Nook and returned it the next day. It kept freezing and highlighting was inconsistent. Immediately ordered the Kindle and absolutely LOVE it. Pages turn quickly. Easy to download books. Highlighting, notes and bookmarks are easy to do.I am reading a lot more since I got my Kindle. I highly recommend it to everyone whether you are an avid reader or just a casual reader. You'll be surprised how your time spent reading increases once you use your Kindle."
5,awesomely great!,"i LOVE my Kindle! the features are cool and convenient and the screen is flawless, like looking at paper. not hard on the eyes at all. i'm just waiting for my little case to get here so i can start taking it out and about without feeling like i might damage it. ^_^"
4,Amazon Kindle,"I have started reading again because of the convinience of the Kindle, also the sheer number of books available. Great product"
5,this is awesome!,"I got Kindle as my high school graduation gift. I never have been interested in reading before and never expected myself to read many novels or books besides what is required for my school curriculum. However, after I got Kindle, I started to explore and download some books. I really love it.. I think Kindle made me love reading.. I like how it has a dictionary within the device, because I haven't learn English for that long, I find it really helpful whenever I don't know a word. Its display of words are also great, just like reading real books, only much more convenient and better! I think Kindle is really awesome :]"
5,"Now, I read more!","I bought the Kindle as a ""gadget"" since I like having gadgets. Since I've had it (3 weeks), I've read three books! I didn't read three books all of last year! This book is so much fun and I find that I read so much faster than the traditional way. It may cost me a fortune especially since I didn't have a line item in the budget for BOOKS before this. My only complaint is that the screen isn't backlit. It would be nice to read in bed or outside at night without having a separate light, but... oh well. I'll get over it.... after I read about 30 more books!"
5,"I love my Kindle, best purchase I have made in years!!!!","This was the first eReader I have purchased and I was hesitant at first. While I had to get over the sticker shock and learn to read without turning pages, I have now come to absolutely love my Kindle. I actually feel like regular books are almost burdensome in comparison. I would recommend this to anyone (and I have already). Love it!!!!"
3,"Love my kindle, but want more from it","I love my Kindle! It's easy to read, it keeps my place if I fall asleep, I can change font sizes... I love all of the features.But, there is one thing I wish my Kindle could do - I want to be able to borrow digital library books. My local library now has 5500 e-books available for loan, but I am unable to access them because the Kindle doesn't allow EPUB format. EPUB has quickly become a standard format for digital books, and the Kindle should be able to support it.Kindle developers - please add a library loan option to the Kindle software!"
5,gadget guy reads on kindle,"OK, so i have been refered to as a gadget guy always having to have the lastest smartphone, electronic devise, blah blah blah. So it only stands to reason that i would purchase a Kindle. Little did i know how much it would change my life! the best kept secret to the Kindle is the ability to email PDF files to yourself. I am a public speaker and have not used a note pad after the purchase of my Kindle. In the past i have done most of my reading because i need to and I understand the value of the end result. As i will be going on vacation later this summer i am looking forward to carrying one Kindle instead of 4 books of which only one or two get read."
4,Kindle,"I received the Kindle as a Christmas gift. I really enjoy the convenience of getting a book anytime, without going to the library or a book store. Everyone who sees me with my Kindle is very curious about it. I would have liked the Kindle to have been back lit. I enjoy reading in the car, especially at night and need a light to see the story I am reading. Other than that, at this point I have enjoyed using my Kindle."
5,Makes a great gift!,"I got my husband a Kindle 2 for his birthday, and it is a HUGE hit! He has probably ""sold"" at least half a dozen friends on it since then. He particularly likes it for business travel: you can read any number of books, newspapers, and magazines without having to add anything heavy or bulky to your carry-on bag.The only problem is that now the 6-year-old wants one too!"
4,Amazing convenience,"I bought the Kindle as a gift for my wife to help with her recovery from surgery. She loves it! The convenience of downloading books from anywhere. The text-to-speech feature really came in handy when her vision was still blurry. I find the five-way controller a little stiff, but overall it's been a great experience."
5,There are pros and cons,"I love my Kindle, but have some things I'd like to share.**If you're giving the Kindle 2 as a gift to someone, or if it's lost or stolen, log into your Amazon account and deregister your Kindle 2 right away. When Amazon ships the Kindle 2 to you, they automatically register it under your Amazon account. If you leave it registered in your name and someone else decides to purchase a book, it'll come from your account!**I wrote up a full review of the Kindle 2 at [...], but the above is probably the most important thing I can tell you. It's Amazon's most gifted item and people need to know!"
5,excellent Christmas gift,"I received the Kindle as a Christmas gift. I really didn't know if I would like it, as an avid reader, books are my friends. I was pleasantly surprised at the ease of use and the speed of downloading material. Unfortunately, I will not be sharing my Kindle with others, they will have to get their own!!!"
1,"Useless Now, Zero Stars",Now that Amazon has shown that they are not willing to live up to their end user license in their actions of illegally stealing books from customers who legitimately owned copies of Animal Farm etc. who is going to buy a Kindle?Amazon has completely lost any possibility of having me as a customer for this device and has severely damaged the market for these devices.
1,External packaging is a dead giveaway,"Have not even turned on the Kindle; it's a gift. I ordered it yesterday with free two-day shipping and it arrived less than 24 hours later. Did not order gift box or packaging, nor did I specify that it is to be a gift, but the external box was labeled ""Kindle"". Duh! Who knew? Amazon surely has some logical sounding excuse, but this is clearly not consistent with other packages received from Amazon. Two wrongs do not make a right. 1) What about security? It was left out on the front step. 2) What about the gift recipient? She does live here with me and might now know what Santa has in store for her. Thanks for your lack of common sense, Amazon."
1,Won't be buying one!!!,"After reading the negative comments, which are the most important ones, I won't be buying a kindle for my wife. I'll look at other options. The buying public is smarter than we get credit for; that is until people start going out of business."
2,Batteries shouldn't be - This should be solar low energy.,"So many calculators with solar power and a specially a book that you want to keep pick it up and start reading. You cannot have a battery run out.That is a flaw. I know the designers know about this..The size is also very condusive to have a solar light sensitive back or bottom panel. Why so many buttons? I have never seen a book with buttons..I know people could buy anything in this country, but this does not help the readers.. Make it basic simple give it a KISS.."
1,overpriced consumerism,"The concept of a portable electronic reader sounds nice on the surface... Instant access to any book in your collection without having to carry the physical book with you. But the economics are insane. I'd rather carry my 17"" laptop with me (or even read on an iPhone) than pay $360 for a single use device plus $10 for the book. As it stands the technology on this thing is worth around $40. Have I used one of these monstrosities yet? Nope. Pick any 10 of my 4-5000 books to cart around on the off-chance I have the time to read them than pay Mr. Bezos to rip me off.The numbers17"" laptop and all it can do $4998"" portable dvd player aprx. $70 plus movies $5-$25iPhone or equiv Smart Phone/PDA $99ipod or equiv mp3 device aprx. $50 plus albums $10(ps. stupid review would not let me rate it a zero)"
1,driving and reading books i know your out there,heard of audio books?????????? please dont read this thing while your driving..!!!! yes ive seen it.... why buy this anyway doesnt your iphone have an app for that???
1,Horrible!,"They recently deleted hundreds of readers' copies of 1984 without their permission (I'm not joking, Google ""Amazon 1984""). Amazon's software allows them not only to delete books at any time, but also to cripple them -- as they did recently when they disabled the ""read aloud"" Text to Speech feature on already purchased titles. Amazon refuses to clarify what exactly their DRM system can do, or how they will or won't use it. Deceptive advertising practices like this are currently being looked into by the Federal Trade Commission. Notice that there is no mention or warning of DRM on the Kindle page."
4,Great .... but,"While I do love my Kindle and the books I have bought to read on the Kindle from Amazon,as advertised, are there before I get off the computer. The weight is perfect and love the shape of the Kindle. Wish that the page size was the full size of the Kindle instead of using inches for the keyboard. The only thing that I don't like and may cause me to return the Kindle is that you cannot download from the public library systems to the Kindle. What would be the reason for that except that they sell books but I've always read books bought from Amazon and from the library also. I'm really NOT pleased about that."
2,Battery problems,"Owned my Kindle 2 for a year and three months before the battery failed to any longer hold a charge. Warranty expired of course. Amazon will replace same model unit for $135 plus shipping and handling. Engineered obsolescence? Buyer beware.While the hardware is now junk, the service continues. So I read on my iPod using Kindle App. I'm no longer interested in purchasing Kindle texts from Amazon, the iPod isn't good enough reading platform, but continue retrieving free texts and using the email service. The user experience has been good as long as it lasted, but 15 months lifespan for the hardware isn't enough for my $350. I feel burned. So, moving on to another reader now."
1,have to have more $,"Kindle was made not to work with public libraries' e-books. You have to pay for every book you want. With a Nook, you can download books from your public library's webpage. Amazon made sure you can not do that."
2,You might want to wait,I liked the Kindle better than I thought. The small amount of text on the screen wasn't as annoying as I thought it would be. It was nice that it remembered where I left off. Highlighting passages or typing in a quick note was handy and I could review the highlighted section easily from a file later.But they dropped the price by $100 less than 2 months after I bought it. The ereader competition keeps improving. The prices for Kindle versions of books are not that much lower than traditional books and sometimes more than the paperback! I can't recommend buying a Kindle.
2,Great idea but image blemish ruined the experience,This is a great idea- how cool to be able to do all these things-But within 30 days our Kindle developed a block at the top where you cannot see the letters. It is a blank spot about 1 inch high by 2 inches wide- It ruins the pages.I emailed for a return but have not yet gotten a response- Still hoping the Amazon folks will make it right!
1,Cant get the books I want on a kindle but I can get it on a NOOk,I used to love my Kindle but now the books I read are not being offered on the Kindle. But I can get them on the Nook. I've looked. The more I talk with different people it makes me really mad. There should be no reason for someone with a Kindle to have to wait to get a book when it's available to other ebook devices. If this doesn't change quick I am making a move....to the Nook
4,"Pretty good, but...","Overall, the kindle performs as stated. My biggest problem has been the price of the books. They are not all $9.99 as Amazon leads customers to believe. I did give some thought to returning my Kindle because of the higher book prices. There have been occasions when the hardcover book is only a few cents more. But I just decided that I will not buy any books more than $9.99. My other main complaint is the absence of folders to place the books in. I would love to see a folder for books I have already read etc. Hopefully Amazon will send out a software patch for this?We have had a few occasions where the wireless would not connect, but eventually it does. We are in the suburbs of a larger city so I didn't expect there would be any problem ever. Other than that the Kindle has been great,"
4,Worthy Little Machine!,"Bought a Kindle 2 for my wife about 2 weeks ago. She definitely likes the ease and convenience of downloading (30 seconds or less) and the simplicity of operation while reading. Some controversy in the press about the price of some books, but as long as you can save $5.00 to $20.00 per book, I'll continue to buy them."
5,Kindle Wireless Reading Device,I love my kindle. It's so much easier than the one I had previously. It goes everywhere with me. Can't wait to take it to the beach.
2,Kindle; an average product... Kindle books? A rip-off!,"I bought the kindle thinking WOW great technology, I used to travell with 3 books, so great for my back too!But as I got the kindle I realized it's not great to jot notes, it's very slow to type, it really could do with a touch screen, and many many other faults (being in Europe, most of the internet features are NOT available).The worst is the price of the kindle books... I thought it HAD to be cheaper... it HAS to, no??? NO!I get to pay up to twice the price of a paper back for something I can only use with kindle, as it comes in propriety format.BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!Kindle Wireless Reading Device (6"" Display, Global Wireless, Latest Generation)"
2,Disappointed,"I've had my Kindle 2 only a few days, and it's already crashed probably two dozen times. Each time I turn it on, it generally crashes a page or two into the book I select. Then, sometimes, it crashes again a page or two later. Then, it loses my place in the book. When it works, it's really nice, but the bugs I'm seeing can be really annoying."
1,I like to OWN the books I purchase,"Beware: books that you pay for with the Kindle are actually RENTED. Amazon reserves the right to delete anything on your Kindle remotely without notice at any time, and they have done just that with two George Orwell books recently: 1984 and Animal Farm (oh, the irony!)"
5,Addicted to my Kindle 2!!,"I absolutely love, love my Kindle! It is SO lightweight and compact. I bought a leather cover for it that doubles as a stand. I do suggest buying a reading light, though, as it's not backlit. I buy books directly from my Kindle and they're downloaded in seconds - no running out the store, and no books cluttering my house. I think it's the best purchase I have made in a long time!"
5,Kindle,"I was one of the lucky ones to get this during the 2010 Black Friday sale. It's 2nd Generation but it works great for me. My husband had to have one once he saw mine, so I got him one for the holidays. He loves it too. Remarkable technology. It makes reading fun again."
2,Public Library Books Issues,I was an early adopter of Kindle and have used several of their devices. I really like the Kindle. But I am now considering moving to other eReaders such as the Nook or Sony as you can not read Public Library eBooks on the Kindle and Kindle does not seem to have a plan or are motivated to create one to accommodate Public Library eBooks.
3,kindle letdown,"I got the kindle as a Christmas last year. It was great at first as I could take it with me everywhere. I was able to sample books and even check my e-mail on the go. I never did purchase books on it but it did give me problems with the screen going blank even after fully charging it. I was able to return it and get a new one--no questions asked. After awhile the ""new"" one had problems with the square button getting stuck where eventually it broke and I couldn't navigate to other pages. Although it was a great gift it was a disappointment overall and can use many improvements."
5,RCFleck,"Love this product, it's so good, I forget I'm reading an electronic book and find myself reaching up to turn the page instead of pushing the button. I find that the dictionary is VERY useful and easy to read. I find that I look up words more readily, etcThe only real negative thing I have to say is that browsing the Kindle store on the Kindle, you need to be careful as you will easily order a book by accident. When you click on a book, if you click a second time before it comes up on the screen, YOU'VE BOUGHT IT!!!! That's because the curser lands on ""BUY"" when the book come up after you've clicked on it. Already happened to me, but was able to cancel it. However while buys are confirmed PDQ, cancellations are much slower and leave you wondering.All in all, highly recommend the Kindle2. Now if I can get it away from my wife, I'll go back to my reading"
4,Love my Kindle but . . .,It's a pretty cool device. I have had it for about a month and take it everywhere. There are a few things I would change but the one thing that is particularly annoying is the graphics are terrible. If you download a children's book that has pictures - forget it. You can barely see them. And cover art for any book - can't see it. I just downloaded and read 'Cane River' and I don't usually care to have drawings or photos in the books I read but this book is a historical fiction written about real people and the author included a lot of old pictures dating back to the 1800's of the characters. Would have been really cool to see them. Couldn't even make out the genelogical chart - that sometimes I really needed to refer to. Too bad . . .
3,Books cost too much,I have had the Kindle for 6 months and have only purchased a few books. I can buy the same book for a few cents more and then be able to share the book. I think the prices are too high.
2,A review of a product not purchased,"My heart lept with joy when I first read that Kindle would be sold here in Norway. Great, an easy and efficient way of reading, and the more I read about Kindle the more I loved the ease and practicality it offered. I was just about ready to order when an article in a newspaper highlighted that very many titles would not be available in Europe. Most of the books on any bestseller list will be unavailabe, - yet again we are met with the limitation we so often meet in US online shops ( Sorry, not for sale in Europe ..we regret, cannot be shipped to ...this product is not avaialbe outside US...and on and on). Why would I pay 279 dollars for a product that barres me from reading the lates bestsellers on it ? And not only bestsellers, but thousands and thousands of other titles have also been barred from purchase. I give it 2 stars for the potential it does have, for what it does offer, but it is severly lacking compared to the Kindle that is available in US."
3,Good and Bad,"I do love my kindle, it's portable and easy to use. I still think $300 is a little expensive and I am still finding a lot of titles I want but Amazon does not have, even when Barnes and Noble has the ebook version. Also I do seem to find several titles at B&N less expensive. Over all if your an active reader with varied taste in reading (and several hundred dollars laying around) it's hard to pass up the Kindles portability."
4,Un fair move o Amazon,"Kindle 2 is a good product, but the fact that Amazon release a new version only 3 months after the launch of the product is a not fair move. May be I was one of the firt persons buying the Kindle 2 on Feb 9, and now only a copule of months later I realize that my product is obsolete.In eBay, I supose that because the launch of KDX, one can find Kindle 2 as cheap as USD 200.One of the thing that really make me upset is the lack of natural reader of PDF in K2. I have a lot of documents in this format, and convertion is not so good. I expect that amazon will provide an update the operating software of the K2 to include a PDF native reader.Sergio Hernandez"
5,Best Gift Ever!,"I didn't even know what a kindle was until my husband gave me this one as a Valentine's present. He always buys the most thoughtful gifts, but he really out did himself with this one! I enjoy reading and just don't have time to hit the library or bookstore all the time. The Kindle is light, big enough to read comfortably, and goes anyway with you. There are so many titles to chose from that download in a matter of seconds. You can sample a title at the touch of a finger and read enough to know if you are interested in the purchase. I have no problems with the product and would definitely recommend it to anyone who loves to read. I even found some very rare titles that have interested me for some time now. It also comes with detailed instructions and step by step follow-up. You won't be sorry with this purchase as it is money well spent."
5,Love...,"I move every six months and every six months I need to get a storage for all of my books! There is no way I would be able to fit them all in my car, however, I also love my books and do not want to give them away... dilemmas...dilemmas... This has been a life saver. I love my kindle, I can take it anywhere it so so small, love the screen, love the space saver, love the dictionary, love everything! I don't know how anyone could be disappointed the the Kindle 2."
5,Kindle Wireless a hit with my wife,"I purchased the Kindle for my wife just before Christmas and she just loves it. She's a typical hard cover and paperback reader who likes the feel of books so I wasn;t sure how she would react to the Kindle - But she loves it and has been reading even more now. She really enjoys the wireless feature that allows her to buy new books almost instatntly.All in all, a great purchase."
1,Very disapointed,Was really excited and ordered lots of books. Kindle 2 screen went bad after only 2 weeks. I sent it back and have been waiting over two weeks for another unit. Of course this conviently takes the 2nd unit out of warranty I understand so I may be left with a 300 dollar book end instead of my eagerly anticipated reading revolusion.
4,Amazon Kindle 2,"The Kndle has proven to be a fairly versatile device. While we did purchase the device primarily for e-reading, we found that it had several other interesting functions that were in development. Overall a good buy, although the price might be a little too high when compared other readers."
4,Yankee,"I am borowing a relatives Kindle, to see if I want to purchase it. I love everything about it except for the Voices that read to you, they sound sooo robotic, my nav system sounds much better. Please make the voices more human sounding, than you have a perfect product!"
5,It talks! TALKS!,"Oh my goodness! I got a Kindle for my birthday and loved it because right now my room looks like a library exploded in it. It saves space and most of the books I read are less than $10. But I tend to read works from the medieval era or the 18th century. It's easy to download everything and pretty straightforward. But then, last night I discovered it talks! The Kindle reads to me! And it reads fairly well. My one complaint is that when the Text-To-Speak function is on it reads everything...and I do mean everything. I'm currently listening to ""The Entire Poetical Works of Lord Byron"". The Kindle will read the numbers of the stanzas (i.e. ""To Caroline 1."" will be read ""To Caroline ONE""), and the footnotes (i.e. ""his dart's relentless force [iii]"" will be read as ""his dart's relentless force AY AY AY""). It's actually quite humorous though so I'm not too agitated by it."
4,"I like it, and I can sell it, too.","I bought a Kindle 2 about two weeks ago. Of course, I love it.I am a law firm administrator, and I brought my Kindle to work the other day. I had lawyers gathering around me to see me demo some of the simple features. One lawyer went back to his office and bought one the same day, and another probably will buy one. Lawyers are the perfect customers for a Kindle. They read continuously and they have the money to buy them. If Amazon gave a discount to buy a Kindle to every legal administrator, or offered one on a loan basis for a month, they could dramatically ramp up their sales to lawyers.It is a great product, and it is the future of reading."
4,2nd one we own.,We bought the 2nd generation Kindle for a father's day gift and recieved it in 3 days. Had to reset the battery workings but otherwise very happy with the whole transaction. easy quick and reliable! Great help from the customer service people in getting our problem taken care of too. Hardest part was finding the customer service phone #.
5,I LOVE my Kindle!,"I bought my first Kindle in April '09 and I was extremely satisfied with it by the time I finished reading the first chapter of the first book that I downloaded. My husband became very ill a few months later and we had to travel to a hospital in another city for 12 weeks. Throughout that period my Kindle was my constant companion, and the convenience of having an unlimited supply of new books without having to leave his hospital room was invaluable to my own physical and mental health. Thankfully, he is recovering and we are home again, but we have a new addition........my husband was so impressed by my ""attachment"" to my Kindle that he finally asked to try it, and we ordered his the next day. We are now a ""2-Kindle couple"", and proud of it!"
4,Original Kindle,"I first saw the Kindle on Oprah's and thought WOW!! I have to have one of those as I read a lot...I was asked by my youngest daughter what I would like for Christmas (2008) and I told her a Kindle....We went online and there it was...Well I got it for Christmas and am very happy with it except for 3 minor issues...#1 battery dies too fast, #2 the back cover of mine for no apparent reason just falls off and last #3 Mine didn't come with any info on what kind of warranty it has...Besides these issues I love it and now my 3 daughters want one but unfortunately too expense for me to buy all 3..Lynn"
4,Headed in the right direction,"The Amazon Kindle is a great product and I hope it catches on very fast. I would like to see this to be the future in all Colleges & Universities in the next 5 years. This is an amazing product to not only have at your conveinence but to to also learn from. A few negatives are that the text to speach feature isn't that great and should be corrected, going back on pages isn't that easy to manuvure, and sorting your library isn't organized that well. Other than that the WiFi concept is very good and the look and feel of it is amazing."
4,Love My Kindle,"I have spent a fortune on books throughout my life and have a difficult time parting with them. I hate to throw them away or even give them away, so, I've run out of space for my books. My husband, frustrated with the lack of space in the house due to my book collection, purchased the Kindle for me for Mother's Day. I love, love, love it! The only feature I wish it had is backlighting. I like to read in bed and a backlighting feature that you could turn off or on would be a nice bonus."
5,I love it!!!,"I love it!!! It is easy to use, comfortable to hold. easy to read. If I had to find a fault with it, and I would have to look hard, I would say that I wonder if it is fragile as someone said they had dropped it and it broke. I love the idea that I can order a book and get it within minutes. I think the prices for looks are reasonable altho I wish all best sellers were $9.99, but that is a small matter."
5,Kindle2 - the best.,"Bought the Kindle2 for my wife as a gift - and she LOVES it! (Actually, she had been dropping hints for a few weeks, but it would have been my choice anyway.) She loves to read, and takes it everywhere. It's light-weight and the perfect size to carry in her purse; also purchased the M-Edge Latitude Jacket (another review). Features she likes best: sizable type, the dictionary, ability to instantly download books (gratification factor), bookmarks (especially to keep track of many characters in a story), extraordinary battery life."
4,Absolutely love my Kindle,"I debated which ebook reader to purchase for several months. I looked at many different brands in the stores, but none of them were working when I would try them. When I saw that Amazon had dropped the price of Kindle 1 and Audible was giving a $100 discount, I couldn't resist anymore. I had already been using my laptop to read Kindle books so the transition to the Kindle was awesome. I could put it into my purse and read where ever I found myself waiting in line or for an appointment. The only complaint I have with my Kindle is that I happen to live in one of those spotty areas that only gets Whispernet occassionally. Due to this, I have to wait to download books until I go to town for something. Other than that, I do love my Kindle. I have found that book reading lights work fine with my Kindle. I do wish that it could be password protected so that not just anyone could pick up my Kindle and read - help with the theft issue."
5,Kindle Reading Device,"Kindle Wireless Reading Device, Free 3G + Wi-Fi, 6"" Display, Graphite, 3G Works Globally - Latest GenerationMy best purchase, easy to use, and the print can be sized as required. I have bought more books than I have as yet read."
5,Excellent!!!,"The Kindle is an absolutely fabulous device. It not only saves the trees that would've been cut down to print the book, it makes it much easier to carry and read. You'll need to be careful if you take it out, as you don't want it to get wet. Buy some kind of water-proof cover, or sleeve. I've gone through several down-loaded books. Make sure you've got plenty in there, because it's hard to stop and put down. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND the kindle."
1,"Dear Amazon,","Dear Amazon Kindle,Its pity that kindle is available even for Tanzania, Tonga, iceland,...but not for Turkiye and we are in the middle of Europe, anyway thanks to apple tablet for coming soon.Regards."
4,Kinlde Plus and Non-Plus,First of all it's great - especially for traveling.I do find the directions not as easy to understand as I might wish.Also it is too easy to hit the wrong place - I found I had ordered a book I did not want and did not know I had ordered.The graphics are beautiful and so well chosen.
3,Kindle 2,I am really enjoying my Kindle (especially the Whispernet). My only complaint is having to click to turn pages. I think Sony's ereader has a much easier way of accomplishing the page turner.
1,Page Turning Satisfaction No Longer Guaranteed,"What happened to reading a real book? There is a valuable engagement one has with a text: it's the slight tear of a page, the crinkle of a cover, the coffee stains of an accidental spill over a cliff hanger. The kindle strips a reader of this personal engagement and interaction with a book. No, not an e-book, but a vulnerable, tangible, collection of pages!"
1,Disappointed in quality,"I had a Kindle 1, and about a week after the warranty expired, it stopped working. I went to use it one day, and the screen was covered in black lines. Nothing removed them, and I was told that my only option was to buy a new one at half price. I don't really feel like buying a new Kindle every year, and it's upsetting that my Kindle just randomly, suddenly stopped working for no reason. Bummer. I would get an iPad instead...it's more expensive but you can use it for a lot more stuff, and I assume those just don't bust on their own out of nowhere."
3,Kindle is awesome. Beware! Book prices are through the roof!,"An avid reader, I wasn't sure I would like the Kindle instead of an actual book in my hand. But I actually enjoyed it a lot from December until April. The price of e-books continue to rise. I'm back to making trips to the library and used book store instead of paying the sky high prices."
3,Kindle,"The Kindle serves it's basic purpose...but for the price I paid I thought there'd be a few bells and whistles. 3G internet should not be advertised because you cannot use the internet for any web searching. I enjoyed the notes and bookmarking capabilities but in the end, I decided to return the Kindle and go with more bells and whistles."
1,Not for mathematical text,"The Kindle 2.0 performs horribly with Greek symbols. So, I would not recommend it for engineering and mathematics textbooks."
1,Can't display math functions,"I will focus this review on people who wanted to use the kindle for any type of math equations. It does not work at all. It will not display the symbol for summation in PDF format or WORD format. Any technical equations will come up as garbage, the wrong character, or not at all. I used it for 5 minutes before I figured out it was completely useless for displaying any type of calculus equation.BEWARE this is for people reading novels, not for academics reading journal articles on pdf or word format."
1,Boycot Amazon over Kindle's theft of user's purchased books,Do not support this criminal enterprise. They will come into your home and steal the books you have purchased in good faith. I will be attempting to file a class action suit over the Orwell fiasco. I am beyond angry. Where are the criminal charges?
4,Reading Ease,"Primary reason for purchase was for travel. We spend months at a time in the RV and it is nice not to haul the extra weight of books since we are avid readers. Very easy to browse, order, and download. And we can still highlight and bookmark passages we want to reread. We can still receive our Readers Digest and an added benefit of receiving our daily newspaper. There have been some complaints about the lack of pictures in the paper but we want the news so we are satisfied. Very easy to use and instructions are easy to understand. I truly appreciate the dictionary always being at hand. My only complaint is the ""joy stick"". I have tremors and this is very small and sensitive to touch. I sometimes have to go foward and back before being able to highlight the item I need. Frustrating but not a big problem. Overall we are very satisfied. They came out with the latest upgrade a few days after we bought this. I understand the problem I mentioned has been improved."
5,Loving My Kindle by Barbara Ellingson,"My hobby is reading. I belong to a Book Club and I read at least a book a week. My fear is that I""ll run out of material. Not with my new Kindle. I'll always have a book to read. The only flaw I've found is accessing a particular page without pressing ""next page"" 300 times. I downloaded a Cookbook and wanted to go back to a recipe and still haven't figured out how to do that without the above procedure and then bookmarking it."
4,Kindle Krazy,I love my Kindle. It is wonderful. I love the whispernet services and the ease of use when buying books and searching for materials. It was worth the initial investment.
5,Kindle,I am very pleased with my kindle. I have had it for about two months now and I love it. It is very easy to use and I have had no issues with receiving my books wirelessly. A great purchase indeed.
1,"Kindle 6"" Wireless Review","We owned the Kindle for less than 30 days when a portion of the top of the screen went blank and there were vertical lines on approx 1/2 of the remainder of the screen. Also, we could not turn the Kindle off.After getting disconnected from service several times, we were able to speak to a rep. They had to send a new one!!! We only used the first one for a month!! What kind of quality is that?We now have the new Kindle and it is working fine--so far. Have only had it for less that one week. Had to spend quite a while on the phone with service getting it set up and able to download books. We lost all of the books that were on the first Kindle.Never would have purchased it if we would have known we would have these problems."
1,Where is the savings...?,"Publishers gouge customers with high prices and justify them by saying the cost of printing/production is really high.Well, if that was the case, then why are eBooks only SLIGHTLY discounted as opposed to the ones in print?It makes me wonder. If you can justify high priced books by saying that production makes the price rise, then why aren't electronic books - books that are never PRINTED - still so expensive?I'm sorry but buying a Kindle would only make me hate the publishers even more. They want me to pay $350 so I can get a 10% discount on some books?It doesn't take a mathematician to see the numbers here don't add up.I'll stick to buying books in print."
1,Price Price Price,"I don't own a Kindle and until they mark it down to $100, I won't. I'm sorry, but $250 for a device that does less than a circa 1990's PDA (that you would throw away instead of trying to sell) is ridiculous.Mark it down and not only will I buy one, I'll probably buy 2. My wife loves reading more than I do. Not only will I buy 2, but I will probably end up spending an additional $300 on content per year.It's good business. It's good marketing. You don't have to be a Harvard MBA to figure it out. The Tickle Me Elmo and Beany Baby Freak market sector (people that just GOTTA HAVE IT AT ANY PRICE) has already been exhausted. It was exhausted 3 months after release. Mark it down."
1,"Give me freedom, not restrictions!","I believe in a way of life based on the free exchange of ideas, in which books have and will continue to play a central role. Devices like this are trying to determine how people will interact with books, but Amazon's use of DRM to control and monitor users and their books constitutes a clear threat to the free exchange of ideas.I demand that Amazon remove all DRM, including any ability to control or access the user's library, from the Kindle.Amazon's assurances that it will refrain from the worst abuses of this power do not address the problem. Amazon should not have this power in the first place. Until they give it up they will be tempted to use it, or they could be forced to by governments or narrow private interests. Whatever Amazon's reasons for imposing this control may be, they are not as important as the public's freedom to use books without interference or supervision."
1,Nope. Not gonna do it.,Won't buy anything like this until all content is available without digital rights management and the central office can't delete files off of my device without my explicit opt-in say-so on a per-file basis. There is still nothing better than paper.
1,expensive and DRM heavy,Download limits on books as well as Amazon removing books from your kindle anytime they want makes this not worth the hassle
5,Love it!!!,I don't know why I hesitated so long to get one! The price decrease was what pushed me in the end and I'm so thrilled with it!
4,"Price Point to High, Now","A great piece of technology and convenience, but clearly overpriced considering what I can get from the iPad at only $200 more. See you at $150 Kindle, I can't wait"
1,Customer Feedback is horrible,"By and large, I've had a good experience with the device over the past year.However, recently I had a problem with a book I downloaded and after navigating the Kindle web pages in vain for a place to provide that feedback, I have to conclude that there is no customer support for the device and rank it accordingly."
1,DRM - you better figure this out quick,Not going to buy until you figure out this DRM crap and stop taking books away from people without notice. You know what... I think I'll just try to find a different source for everything that I buy from Amazon. You are to big for your own good. You had a good product until you screwed it up. I hope the guy with the lawsuit wins.
1,Do NOT buy the Kindle,"I bought the Kindle when it first came out for my husband for Fathers Day 2008. At first he resisted this new technology but then got used to it and came to love it. He travels alot and commutes by train. Shortly after purchasing it, he began to have problems. Kindle support was helpful and even replaced the defective unit at no charge. Then the replacement Kindle DIED and when I called Kindle support, I was told ""Sorry but it's outside the manufacturer's warranty"" (by 2 weeks) and you can buy another. Why would I spend another dime when I already spent $359 to buy a product with a 100% FAILURE RATE??? This product is NOT worth your hard-earned money. It was a good idea but they do NOT stand behind the product. We are VERY DISAPPOINTED. Do NOT waste your time and money."
4,"Non-""gadgety"" wife likes it!","April 2009:Bought as a birthday present for my wife, against the advice of friends and family as she's really not into electronic gadgets.After about an hour she liked it. After a week, she loved it.-easy to read-easy to use-lightweight-BUY a cover when you order thisAs a geek myself, I like it. I do wish that more of the front area was used for the display, either by making the display larger or making the whole thing smaller. Otherwise, I'm pretty favorably impressed."
1,Kindling,"Yeah I really want Amazon to select and limit the books available for me to read by buying into Kindle.Any LGBTQ writers available or promoted with the Kindle?Something tells me ""no""."
2,"I agree, Awesome Concept, Gruesome Price!","I really like the concept and design of the Kindle and really want one but I refuse to pay the price. Just too much money. Amazon should offset a large part of the cost in the pricing of the books, newspapers, blogs, etc. I would even consider paying a small monthly fee for use of the device if it could significantly offset the cost. 359.00 is just too much..."
2,Book Exerpts Sample,"The Issue I have is with the Systems. The one and only issue I have is when you download a sample, I have been finding more and more the 'sample' has nothing to do with the guts of the book, but rather 'Contributors, Library of congress info etc.""Seriously, If you are giving us a sample, give us a sample!"
5,"So far, excellent","So far everything has worked nicely. We have only had it a week or so. On two occasions the Kindle froze, but instructions were clear about how to get past this. We like it."
4,Love it but where is the light?!?,We love the Kindle but I am stunned that there you cannot backlight the screen. It is such a glaring omission that I keep thinking I am just missing the button! So much for lying in bed at night and reading without a light on. Guess I'll have to spend even more money and buy a clip-on light.
5,The Kindle is great!!,I have had the Kindle for over a month now and really love it. Downloading takes very little time and the books are a little cheaper than physical copies. I wasn't sure if I would like not having pages to turn and the book in hand but it is not a problem at all. There are tons of free books if you are looking for classics. I highly recommend this to anyone. I am reading much more now than I ever did before.
4,A blessing,"I got the kindle reader for my stepson for Christmas, he has enjoyed it and takes it every were he go's. Having researched all book readers on the market at the time i found this one to be the best. Some of the others had restrictions like the Sony. I hear that kindle are coming out with a color screen which i am looking forward to the i will buy one for my self."
4,E Pads a begining,"Years ago, I would watch Star Treck the Next Generation. Geordie and Data would be carrying around tablet's (E Pads). I used to imagine me carring such a item. Well we imagine no longer with the advent of Kindle. I view ""Kindle"" as a wright brothers version of a tablet display. In the near future I see displays measuring 8.5 x 11 inches, color imaging, access to all publications, low cost, and low weight. Kindle points the way"
5,It's the GREATEST!!!,"I've wanted a Kindle since they first came out several years ago, but just wouldln't spend the money. A friend was just talking about hers when the price came down and I decided to get it. I couldn't be happier. My eye sight has changed over the past few years and only contacts help me see clearly. My favorite time to read was when I went to bed in the evening, but stopped reading when I couldn't read anything but big print when I took out my contacts. Now without them I can read clearly on my kindle because I can enlarge the print. And it's so light weight and easy to take anywhere. I just love it!!!!"
1,Still waiting in New Zealand,"I was thrilled to see that an international version of Kindle was out, but that did not last long. It is still not available in New Zealand, despite being available in Fiji, New Caledonia and Australia. Come on Amazon, we are not that hard to find."
4,Love it!,The only thing that would make this better is to have it be backlit for easier reading at night. Great little gadget! Reading more now cuz it is so convenient!
4,Kindle succeeds!,"The Kindle is a welcome addition for the serious Book Lover. Although it will never replace my hard and soft cover books, you just can't beat it for convenience when you are out and about or on a trip. I often read two to three books at a time, and now I no longer have to carry them all with me. Thanks Amazon! Also thanks to the Kindle support staff for being so friendly and efficient in their handling of a recent problem."
5,The Kindle Rocks!,"I bought the Kindle for my Dad for father's day. He doesn't get out like he used to, and he watches alot of television. I thought it would be a great way to keep his mind active and I was right. He loves it so much that he has become addicted to reading instead of world news. I'm so happy that he is so happy. What a great device. My Dad is now going to get my niece a Kindle for College."
4,"Kindle 2 is Great, but the text-to-speech needs work.","I love the Kindle 2. I love that it's lightweight,thin and so portable. I love that you can download your books wireless. I love that it is so easy to use that you don't need the manual. It is very user friendly. I did try the text-to-speech and thought it was awful. The male/female voices are very mechanical. They are annoying. After 2 minutes I turned this feature off. In my opinion, this is the only negative about the Kindle. Other than that it rocks!!!!!"
3,Good product but understand its limitations,"I ordered Kindle 1 but by the time it came, it was Kindle 2. Looking at the differences, they didn't affect me all that much. In fact I blogged a very positive review which I don't want to re-type; here's a link:[...]Before I ordered, though, I had already decided a couple of things:1. Kindle is mainly for convenience; less to carry, several books at once in a limited space;2. It's useful for books I don't intend to keep long-term;3. It's also very useful for travel or vacation reading;4. The catalog of available Kindle editions is focused on fiction and light non-fiction; there is less really serious stuff available, AND if you read footnotes, forget it - they're not reproduced in Kindle. (You can find the notes section at the end of the book but there are no references to them in the text, so you will need to read them sequentially, without reference to the text.)"
5,Great birthday gift,"I love my new Kindle. It makes reading more enjoyable. It is light and easy to carry, no thick books to mess with and you never loose you place. It is super easy to download any book-faster than you can imagine. The dictionary feature and highlight capabilities are great too. I love love love my new kindle"
5,Kindle addict,"I love my kindle so much, I bought one for my wife for her birthday. She loves hers just as much as I love mine. The only thing missing from this 2nd generation device is the SD expansion slot from the 1st generation kindle. I download a lot of books from http://www.gutenberg.org and I can't archive them to my Amazon library. Amazon after adding a touch screen, color, back lighting, & more books (ie. text books), please put back the SD expansion slot."
5,Love It!,I can't say enough of the kindle. I love to read and couldn't find the time to go to the library. This has truly made a difference. It's easy to use and the downloads are super fast. I don't have to worry about when my books are due and I can read when I have the time. I love the built in dictionary since I always had to look up words I didn't understand. I can go days without needing to recharge it and would highly recommend this product to anyone who loves to read. It is truly worth the money.
1,BEWARE,"JUST RECEIVED MY KINDLE AND I CAN NOT CONNECT BECAUSE SPRINT WIRELESS DOES NOT HAVE A CELL SITE WITHIN 70 MILES.YOU CAN NOT DOWNLOAD ANYWHERE/ MISLEADING, ANYTIME MISLEADING SO BEWARE, NO SPRINT NO KINDLE 2HOPEFULLY I CAN RETURN"
1,no colors,"I'm not buying a Kindle until they have it in purple. Who wants white, or light gray? They need to offer the Kindle in pretty colors like: purple, orange, turquoise, medium blue, magenta, pearl, etc. This is a no-brainer. I can't believe they didn't think of this from the start. Duhhhh to Amazon's marketing department."
2,Amazon stinks,"I've purchased 5 -- count 'em, five -- Kindles, the last one 40 days ago. That falls 10 days outside the refund period, and Amazon has refused to do anything for me even though I paid $70 more 40 days ago than I would pay for the same kindle today. Most of the Kindles I bought were gifts. I'm selling my kindle on ebay. I'm reading on my iPad from now on. Amazon customer service sucks. 30 days is random. The Amazon era is over ... Hello Wal-Mart."
3,Can I read my Microsoft Reader Ebooks?,I have 100's of Microsoft Reader ebooks. I wonder if they can be converted to be used with Kindle?
3,When does the third generation come out?,"Think I am going to wait. Any idea when the colored version is being released, and what, if anything, anyone knows about it??"
2,Content Question,"Can you not get content for the Kindle from other sources - Project Gutenberg e.g.? (Free is a nice price.)If not, I'm not buying this sucker.SuzanneP.S. I didn't see a way to ""contact us"" to ask Amazon this question directly. They obviously do not want to be contacted. (You want to actually touch the product??? Call someone who has one! Yeah, sure!)"
1,No Harry Potter Books,I just purchased the Kindle2 for my daughter only to find out that none of the Harry Potter books are available to download. I read plenty of the reviews and find it odd that none of them mention this.
5,Love it,"Had been considering getting one, but was going to wait.Looked at one my friend has & wen right home & ordered it.Have not been disappointed.With all the snow, cable's been off, Internet's been off, electric's been off, soooo - just downloaded a new book & read.Extremely glad I purchased it when I did"
5,Wonderful,Before purchasing this product I was weighting between kindle two and ipad. I have try both and personally I like e-ink better. Looking forward to kindle 3.
4,"excellent, no regret","I have been using my kindle for about 1 year. And I love it very much. The most amazing thing about it is that I could use my kindle to check my email and browse the web in Israel last week, free of charge. Yes, the speed is slow and the browser function is basic. But being able to use the internet almost anywhere in the world is a blast. The international whispernet function is the most worthy thing!Hope the future update will make it more stable (it still clashes from time to time when using internet) and will offer more features (esp. pdf zooming)."
4,It wins my heart,"I have been waiting for this technology for a long time. I can't resist the low price of e-books but hates reading from LED screen. And I would not print it out as it is not environment-friendly.The price still makes many people hesitate before buying. I traded one of my designer's bag for Kindle and I think it's totally worth it. Now I read more, think more and shop less. :-) Overall it's a lovely product and I enjoy using it.I took off one star because the screen is still small and the wireless is extremely slow. It's quite fussy to use that little button to navigate on web page. I don't use the wireless at all."
3,Real quick:,I love it. It made my reading much more pleasant and dynamic. I use the highlighting feature a lot. Just Amazon has to work hard on three issues:- overall speed- screen resolution- battery lifeThanks
5,Surprisingly good,"The newer version by far exceeds the older version and it's absolutely amazing how much it has developed. The books download even quicker and it is easy to sync between my kindle and iPhone. This is an awesome product though i still hope for a future device to include a touch screen, you should definitely purchase one."
5,Kindle's for me,The greatest thing since sliced bread! I love the ease with which it can be held. No more prying those thick books open to read the pages. Those with arthritis in their hands will appreciated the thin profile and light weight.
3,Screen troubles,"I am the owner of a Kindle one, which for the most part I love, however over the past three years that I have owned this one it has been replace three times for ""screen burn"". Now they want $99.00 to replace my Kindle with a refurbished one. This screen burn seems to be an issue which repeats itself and to say that I a truly dissatisfied would be an understatement. I know someone with the second generation Kindle who has experienced the same problem. Perhaps it is time to give the Sony a try."
2,Too expensive,"Nice toy, but still too expensive for what it offers.It definitively needs a cover, as the screen gets scratched very easily."
4,Am pleased,"Am enjoying my new kindle very much. It is all that it said it would be. Really enjoy, and need, the font adjustment...it makes reading so much easier.Got the Wash Post but am disappointed that some parts of the paper are not on Kindle. I miss the Parade and Crosswords sections.Would be nice if there was a ""backlight (?)"" feature so that the Kindle could be read without the need for a lamp.All in all, very pleased and highly recommend it."
1,Do not buy this product,"My spouse purchased this junk for me. It wouldn't take a charge from almost day one without having to wrap the cord around the unit to hold the plug in just the right place. Within a few months, it started restarting repeatedly. Now it is completely frozen. Just buy a book and read it. Kindle is synonymous with junk."
5,diappointment,"i love, love, my Kindle, but disappointed the price went down so significantly in just a few days of purchase"
1,Nice reading device while it works,"I've enjoyed the Kindle as a reading device for two years. The positive is that it is a fine way to collect and read available books and magazines. The negative is that graphics do not come through well, so do not purchase any item containing many pictures or illustrations. Do not expect it to last more than a year or two. The screen freezes often and you have to open the back and insert a paper clip to reset it, and after a while that stops working. If the price were lower or if it lasted longer I would buy another, but for now I'll read my book collection on the Kindle for PC."
2,not too great,"I had my Kindle for 2 and a half weeks, loved it. Was just going to start my 3rd book. I picked it up to turn it on, and the screen looked like it had been smashed. I was shocked, as no such thing had happened to it. It was completely unreadable, now I have to wait months for a new one, and because I live in Canada a new one couldn't be shipped to me, but a refurbished one could. I chose to wait for the new version. Guess we'll see how it holds up"
3,3G Kindle,"Just as we received this Kindle, we learned there was a newer and better Kindle being introduced, so we never used it and sent it back. We plan to order the newer and more advanced model"
2,Kindles Connection outside USA not good,"Bought a kindle, supposed to have 3G global wireless but still can't connect and therefore register, is really annoying. Troubleshooting no good as all it says is to reset the kindle, don't know how many times I have done that. Can't download books till can connect. For what I spent on it having to go back and forth trying to figure out the problem it getting to be a waste of time."
2,PDF view with Kindle,"I'm very disappointed with my 6"" Kindle, because I can't or bearly read Pdf of The Economist and Scientific American digital downloads into my Kindle. Letter fonts are so tiny that the only way to be able to read is having a 4x magnifier!!!! If you want more input on my review, please do no hesitate to contact me at manuel.velasco.g@gmail.comManuel"
2,Poor rendering of tables and figures,"I like the Kindle and it's great for reading anything that doesn't include tables and figures (i.e. wonderful for most non-fiction). However, I do read a lot of books that include tables and figures. The books range in type from self-help, fitness and technology. The problem isn't just with the Kindle - it's the Kindle formatting. My initial thoughts were to load the Kindle app on my PC, download the ebook and then everything would be OK. This isn't the case. The formatting prevails and is just as illegible on the PC as it is on the Kindle itself."
4,International Kindle,"A friend of mine had a Kindle which he showed me when I was in Hawaii in 2008. Loved it and couldn't wait to buy one, but at that time they weren't being sold in Australia. So when they became available I purchased one. I was very pleased when the very fast delivery (about 4 days door to door). The technology is great, but IO wish I'd known I wouldn't have assess to all the books that are available. Apparently it's due to copyright or some other thing. Wish I'd known that before I bought it. I would have waited 'til it was all sorted out. I think this should have been made very clear. It's very annoying that almost every book I want to buy, the page tells me this book is not available in Australia. So I guess I'll just have to put it in the bottom draw until this BS is all sorted out.Bajor025"
4,I'm a convert!,"I wasn't ever tempted by e-readers before, but the thing that made me want a kindle was the ease of buying books and having them downloaded into my device, without me having to connect it to the computer and sync it. I have thousands of cds that haven't made it onto my ipod for this very reason, it's just too much work. The kindle is easy to use, and the screen is easy to read. The list of titles available to Australian buyers is somewhat limited but I understand that a wider range should be available soon. As I am studying education I was delighted to see that a wide range of educational texts are available, much cheaper than I could get them in Australia. This alone makes the kindle worth the money for me.A touch screen and optional backlight would make this device a 5 star item for me, but overall I am really happy with it."
4,Mandatory for Travelers,"A recent business trip and a reward coupon from Amazon caused me to take another look at the Kindle. Since I was only going to be out of town for three days, I wanted to pack a carry-on. With space at a premium, I didn't want to pack three paperbacks--yet I knew that reading material would be mandatory. The Kindle was perfect. It's so small and slim that it fits into my handbag. Best of all I've re-discovered the joy of reading some wonderful authors. The $9.99 price tag for most bestsellers versus the $29 for a hardcover or $14 for today's paperbacks is yet another good reason to invest in the Kindle. And I was pleasantly surprised to see how many books have fallen into the public domain. The amount I'm saving will pay for this investment within the year and the ease of carrying make me look forward to my next deadly dull business trip."
4,My Kindle's Kinda Awesome!,"I love my new Kindle! Took it to Cancun and was able to keep up with my friends on Facebook down there with it. The only thing I don't like is how easy it is to delete books from it when you don't mean to. If you go to select a book to read from your list on the Home page and press the joystick slightly left and in instead of pushing the button in only, your selection is immediately deleted from your Kindle. You have to go online to get it back, and sometimes that is impossible if you're out of range of a cell site. It is very frustrating. I've done it three times in the 3 weeks I've owned my Kindle. They need to change that feature so you can't accidentally delete something. Otherwise, I love everything else about it! I'm doing a lot more reading than I used to."
5,Excellent Product,"I bought the kindle 2 last month. Had issue with right corner of screen not changing from sleep mode. (maybe dropped in transit?) I talked to Amazon,they shipped me a new Kindle overnight air so I could continue my reading. The product is great for reading books (what it was intended for). If you are like me and can read for hours without stopping,then this reader is for you. My eyes are not strained after reading that long. Try doing that on a laptop or smartphone.Excellent selection of books for all types of reading, pricing is at a very good point, (hopefully it will stay this way). Magazine prices are on the pricey side at this time.Amazon service is second to none. I always look at their site when making a purchase. Good reader and a good company backing it, a winning combination.Regards,Guy"
3,Kindle 2: Very enjoyable with some caveats!,"I really like my new Kindle. I've tried 2 newspaper subscriptions and am now reading Dan Brown's ""The Lost Symbol"". As a e-book reader it's flat out great. What convenience! However, as a replacement for the daily read of the newspaper it leaves a little to be desired.First off, the daily e-subscription does not contain all of the articles (OC Register & LA Times) nor, are some of the articles as complete. Additionally there are sometimes occasional typos or other display errors which don't give the newspaper as polished a read as it could be. Both the Register and Times need to do a better job of delivering a high quality, complete and timely edition for e-book readers. I do enjoy the convenience of taking the ""paper"" with me in such a format however."
5,review 1,"I have never been happier with a product. I love my Kindle. I am a grad student so you can see how my kindle will be valuable to me in my studies and so convenient. The only problem I had was when I first got it, I was examining it and accidently ordered a book that was recommended. I finally got it taken off, but it was too easy to make a mistake like that. You have to be careful where you touch because it is so quick you don't even realize what you have done until you get your notice that the book is in your collection. No doubt about it, it works fast. I do love the idea that my Kindle can read to me as I travel to class, or to work, or to visit my grandchildren three hours away. Makes travel a lot more interesting.I even take it to the laundramat!"
5,Kindle 2,"After using the Kindle 2 today, I am extremely happy with my purchase. The device is light enough but still manages to feel solid. It fits nice in your hands as well and is easy to hold while reading. The screen is wonderful too! Overall, I am very satisfied with my Kindle 2."
1,"Licensed books, not purchased","Amazon only licenses you the books, leaving them the option to revoke the license and steal your book back at any time. Screw that, stay away from the Kindle and purchase something else where you have the rights to your book. Boycott the Kindle!"
5,it's simply perfect,"it's a great time saver. Download - read. It's handy, lightweight. Take it where ever you go. I just love it."
4,Kindle,"Makes it an expensive ""book"" (you still have to buy most books to download) but it is a nice way to read. No dog-eared pages, and it always remembers your place; whatever book you're reading.Text read feature is not so great. An animated computer voice can only read words, and that can miss inference of meaning.You must decide if the $260 or more justifies the purchase. How much reading do you do, and how many books do you normally carry around. If the answer to both is ""a lot"", then this IS for you."
5,TRULY AMAZING !,"I travel frequently to places where I don't have access to English newspapers. Now I download Financial Times e.g. every morning to my notebook computer, which takes 6 seconds, and 2 seconds to transfer to my Kindle DX. Now I can read my newspapers anytime, anywhere. I read much faster too since I can change the font to HUGE and my eyes are not strained anymore. I don't miss the printed version at all. Books are much easier to read too, I'm so glad I bought the Kindle, it's really worth it.bought the leather platform case, which protects my Kindle and props it up so I can read handsfree. But I do wish the case weren't so heavy."
5,I enjoy reading again,I have a busy schedule and have found it inconvenient to carry around books and maintain bookmarks in various books. So I haven't been able to read as much as would like. Now I can browse the Amazon store and start reading a new book instantly. I can take it anywhere with me and I have no doubt I'll be reading through books quicker.I also don't have time to read the full newspaper in the morning so it's nice to be able to do it during various times of the day without having to fold it up and take it everywhere with me.
5,Amazing out of the box!,"I waited to buy a Kindle for quite a while because I typically only read when I travel. When I received my Kindle this week I was impressed with the 100% recycle packaging, the simple startup and registration process, the ease to purchase the most recent Economist, and the e-ink screen. Typically I don't enjoy reading on other hand held devices, but I can already tell that I will read more with the Kindle because it is easy to get content and to read."
2,Like the device but beware of the screen,"I had the device for 2 months and used it only twice until the screen was damaged. I put the reader on the empty airline seat next to me and my husband put his newspaper and book on top of the screen...that pressure caused the screen the black line and become not able to read from again. I knew by other reviews that people had issues with the screen but thought I am generally a very careful person with things so it would not happen to me. Much to my surprise it did happen to me. Another frustrating point was when I called amazon to see if they could fix the screen I was told that they do not do repair but offered to sell me a refurbished model (funny it's refurb when they ""don't repair""). BEWARE OF THE SCREEN."
4,Betrayed,"The hardware is wonderful, your marketing ethics are highly reproachable. I bought this product at no small sacrifice (diabled small pension and SS). You then raised the price on the e-books which will seriously curtail my abilty to take advantage of the system.Shame on you - you should consider expanding into the used car market where ""Bait and Switch"" is the primary marketing tactic."
2,screen went bad,"I bought 3 kindles for gifts at Christmas. All the recipient LOVE them. My husbands screen went bad after less than a month. first a little spot on the upper corner then the whole right side and it is unusable. the others are still working great. I will contact Amazon and if the problem is fixed, i will write another review about their policies. Thanks"
5,I love it!,"I looked for about 5-6 months before I finally decided to bite the bullet and buy one! I normally don't spend this kind of money on myself, but some of the best money I'll ever spend. I also bought the neoprene (spelling?) cover and the myghty light (again spelling?). So simple to use, love the ability to change font size, download book when I want it, all the things it says it will do!Go ahead - SPEND THE MONEY!!!!"
5,kindle wireless,"Love the ""samples"" which avoids purchasing something I will never read. Am reading more and a greater variety of books. Especially handy for travelling. Last European trip took 5 pocketbooks which took up a lot of space in my 22"" suitcase.....and to make matters worst...only read 2. Battery has long life. A cover is a must."
1,Doubleplus ungood!,Love my Kindle - until I found out you might delete my books if the publisher asks you to! And about the refund - does that work both ways? Can I return any book I want and get a full refund? How about returning the Kindle itself? Doubleplus ungood Amazon!!
3,Kindle burn-out,"My husband (the railroader) gave me a Kindle for my birthday a year ago - I would never have bought this for myself. It took me a while to warm up to it, but have enjoyed its convenience, especially when traveling. Lately the books have gotten more and more expensive, and I'm just tired of spending so much money for a book that I may read only once. I've put down my Kindle and dusted off my library card. Now I shamelessly use the Amazon store feature on my Kindle to find books that I may want to read, download the sample, and when I find a book that looks interesting head to my public library and get it for free. Sorry, Amazon."
2,"If you live in Asia Pacific, don't but kindle..","I bought Kindle 3-4 months before and I have to say I enjoy it. I don't have to carry books around, I don't have to wait until new book comes to Thailand and I don't have to pay a lot for book delivery. However, I found that kindle version of many book are not available for Asia Pacific. I think it's ridiculous. When I complained via email, Amazon said it depends on publisher. I'm trying to understand that but some are not make sense at all. For example the Aurora Teagarden mystery by Charlaine Harris. Book 7 is the only book that not available for Asia Pacific. So, I have to buy that book. What's the point to buy Kindle then? It happens quite often and I felt sorry to buy Kindle.I'm waiting for new book of Rick Riordan, the red pyramid and now it's available for Kindle and again, it said not available for Asia Pacific. So, don't buy Kindle if u live in Asia Pacific. They don't care about us."
4,A great gift!,I bought this as a gift for my wife and does she ever love it! She loves the ability to set the font size and that it can read to her if the need arises. The only complaint she has is that when she looks at what to buy it sometimes accidently purchases a book she was only trying to find out more about.
5,A Fantastic Gift!!,"I bought the kindle for my fiancee for Christmas & he LOVED IT!! I was frankly surprised because he's not a techie AT ALL, but he loves to read. We were away on vacation & I included his favorite newspaper subscription & a couple of books as a part of his gift & it was a great hit! He carries his kindle with him everywhere!"
5,The Amazing Amazon Kindle,"This wireless reader does everything you need. Buys books, newspaper, printed media on-line with complete ease. Can see the screen in full sun light, battery last very long time. This Kindle is for the true reader, someone who enjoys reading rather than computing."
1,scams and cons.,"whats the point of kindle? its just another way to rip people off and steal their money. what happend to all of the papaer and hardcover books you already own, there isnt anyway to achieve them on your kindle without having to buy them all over again. most of these kindles are stupid looking and cheaply made, and when poeple get them, i have seen many complain of how its is broken all toegether or doesnt work at all......rad a book people, i mean an actual book, and ignore all these over long and stupildy over rated 5 tstar reviews and go to the real reviews. the one star ones.thanks."
2,disappointed,i bought this about a year ago and eventually threw it away. i was so excited by it but it would not stay on the nipples. so disappointing.
2,Old Fashioned,I bought a Kindle a few years ago and gave it away. Guess I could not get used to reading a book electronically. I have always been a reader and enjoy displaying books.An actual book is like an old friend to me and should not be stored in cyberspace.
1,Kindle colors,Hey Folks. I am not going to buy a Kindle until it comes out in Colors!!! Pastels And dark colors. And even patters as plaid. When they come out with themes too like chess or football. What were you thinking Kindle??? I hate that ugly off white color. Yuck! You can do better than that. Dakota
1,"The Kindle - A Great ""Not Ready for the World"" Product",I want a Kindle. The Kindle is a great product idea.However it suffers from one major flaw.The owner can only buy content in North America. If you live anywhere else that's just too bad.This really a shame as Amazon has built a fantastic reputation selling and delivering goods all over the world.Something has got to be done about the myopic licensing of content issue as persons in other countries can buy the same titles and content in print form but not for an electronic reader like the Kindle.If not for this issue I would have bought two of these devices already. The vast number of novels that my wife reads could be neatly stored in the Kindle and I would be able to travel with my book collection. Our books could easily fill a Kindle.For Amazon this is an issue that just has got to be fixed.
2,text to speech is disabled,disabling accessability to the disabled pisses me off. i bought an android phone instead. has a great text to speach reader and access to 'more' books than this kindle. _amazon_ _you_ '_fail_'.
1,Really?,"I'm sure this is a great product and all..but I just can't justify spending $400.00 on a device that only specializes in one thing. I love books. I read all the time. However, how is this device suppose to save me money on best sellers when the initial price point is so high? It would take me almost 3 years to recoop the cost. It's just too dang expensive. Sorry guys...but the iphone gets my business."
2,Deception about Kindle 2 cover.,"We got a Kindle about a year ago and love it. When the ad for the Kindle 2 came out we jumped to buy it. Were we surprised that there was no cover with it. The thin Kindle 2 needs a cover both for general reading comfort and for travel. Now I have my Kindle and have to fork out $30.00 plus postage. I feel ripped off!Be up front in the ads that the cover isn't included and that it is strongly recommended getting one. At least that way one could make the decision to get the cover at the same time as the Kindle purchase and save the postage, or just plain decide not to buy the Kindle at all, since in reality it costs $30 more than the advertised price."
1,My MInd is Made Up,"If I could have given no stars, I would have. Now that I have learned, via the New York Times, that Amazon can and will remove books from your personal device that you have already bought and paid for, without warning, I know what to do with that $299: give it to my local library. For shame, Amazon."
4,Bibles on Kindle,"Excellent for periodicals, and for books read from beginning to end. But not so good for Bible study: Search for a phrase will find the phrase, but not give the book, chapter or verse where it is found. Also, there is no Kindle edition of a NRSV Bible."
4,Kindle 2,This was a gift for my grandaughter's graduation from college. She is heading into Med School. Hope Med school text books can be down-loaded. She loves it.
4,Alice's Review,Great e-book - much better than any other that I have seen out there. Adding a little light would be nice - probably draining on battery.
5,I Love It,"So there are like three minor things that I would change, but this is a great consumer device. I am very pleased with instant downloads, cheaper book prices, and no shipping cost. It is also great using calibre, a free program that converts other formats into Kindle format. This program is can be downloaded and works like a dream. I have it configured to download all of my favorite blog and sync them onto by Kindle. This is a great reader."
5,Kindle Magic,"I purchased this as a gift for my wife. I think, after all these years, it's her favorite gift of all time. She takes it everywhere with her-on the plane-in the car-waiting room for appointments-lunchtime at work, and even when go on a cruise. I may soon be able to get rid of her giant bookcase because she doesn't need it anymore."
4,"Kindle works great, but","I received my kindle for mother's day about six months ago and everything was great. I thought it was the best thing since sliced bread. I read a lot and the kindle made it much easier for me to read just about anywhere in the world. Unfortunately two days ago my kindle stopped working. The screen had black and gray lines and the Amazon fixes didn't work. A lot of the reviews I read weren't positive about getting a replacement. I figured it won't hurt to try so I called Amazon customer service. After a short conversation with a rep, I got a replacement. Hats off to Amazon for standing by their product."
4,Pleasantly Suprised,"I've been hesitant to buy an e-book, but since the hardback books are starting to pile up around the house, this seemed like a convenient way to store some new books and shrink my carbon footprint. Plus version 2 has to be better than the original! I was pleasantly suprised by how easy it is to read. I do wish it had some kind of back light to the screen and on occasion it seems to be a little slower than I'd like when going into wireless mode, but overall I would definitely recommend! I would also highly recommend purchasing a protective cover. I have dropped mine and am glad the cover was on to protect it."
4,Hard copy of Users Guide for Kindle,"I would like to have been able to purchase a hard copy of the Users guide. NOT have to down load and print 131 pages which in my little computer took almost 6 hours, including refilling paper paper tray 4 times. Please recognize that all of your customers are not a computer whiz. We are just simple old people."
1,No more Amazon for me. Sick of Kindle shoved down my throat.,"I used to like browsing Amazon's book selections by New Releases, Best Sellers, and Subjects. NO MORE! Everywhere I turn, every page I'm on, Kindle is being force fed to me. I don't own a Kindle and I never will."
1,Might have been nice to have.,"After taking the day off from work to be able to sign for the package, and checking the tracking ""that showed it was out for delivery"" it never arrived. Checking back after the end of the day Fed-X tracking showed incorrect address. Called Amazon to check and was told they shipped it to the wrong address. The account used for this order I have been using for about one year and have over 95 orders on it in just in the last six months, with no orders going astray. No changes have been made to my account since it was set-up. But now after losing a day's pay my account is being charged and I will have to wait for the item to come back and be processed to receive a refund. So now ordering Kindle 6"" instead of the Kindle DX (to make up for a day's pay lost to receive delivery)all I have is the charge on credit card."
1,Kindle problem,It would be nice if Amazon would stop shoving Kindle in my face every time I go to the Amazon website
5,Love it!,I really have enjoyed my Kindle the first month after it's purchase. I do have one complaint. One of the reasons for this purchase was to get recently released books for a much lower cost than a hardback edition. Now I see that since ipad has been released the price of the kindle edition books has gone up and I have heard rumors that this will continue. I am not pleased with this 'business' decision and I hope others are as well. All in the product itself is great.
4,Amazon Kindle 2,"I love the kindle 2! They don't tell you that you can get internet access. Definately download/order ""the kindle 2 cookbook: handbook"" by david emberson. It tells you how to access internet and other tricks. Downloading books is very easy and quick. And you can first download samples at no fee. There are some books that are free all together. And if you make a mistake, it does give you a chance to cancel your purchase.A little dissapointed in the magazine selection. I would like to see a much larger selection. There are only 25 choices. (4 are new, so i guess they'll keep adding more)I enjoy the ""text-to-speach"" feature! When i start to get tired and want to shut my eyes, i just listen.It's nice to have a library of books with you, without the bulk! Novels, Dictionaries, Magazines, Newspapers, Cookbooks! They all come with me on vacation!"
4,Love my new Kindle 2,"This is agreat product for someone who reads alot. You don't have to bring 4 or 5 books with you. Its all very simple. I would like to see a greatly improved Text to Speech as its really pretty horrible right now. Also, it would be nice it it came with a basic skin of some sort as its quite slippery and I'm always afraid I'll drop it!"
5,No-line Bifocal glasses no longer a problem reading a Kindle2,"I had just about given up reading books because I had trouble keeping the words in focus when reading with my no-line bifocals. The Kindle2 has solved that problem for me. The width of the page is such that my eyes can rapidly move back and forth as they always have done. Trying to learn to ""turn my whole head"" with my eyes so that the optimum spot on my glasses traveled across the pages was too difficult for me. I spoken with others who have had this problem, so I thought I'd comment for anyone on the edge about whether they should give the Kindle2 a try. I wasn't sure I could justify getting it, but now I am so glad I did. This one feature alone is worth the price to be able to read as fast as I want in ease. And I love all the features."
4,The Kindle works,"I bought the Kindle for my wife, primarily for her to use with her book club. She was thrilled on Christmas day; the setup and book ordering process went smoothly and after getting a cover to protect the device she's been happily carrying it around and using it regularly. My only complaint is the limited number of titles for sale."
5,Simply Marvelous,"I have been holding out on purchasing a Kindle for over a year ...as there is always a new generation just around the corner. I was also torn between the Sony Reader, the Nook ,and the Kindle. As Kindle is the standard and seems to always be ""the one"" picked in reviews, I finally pulled the trigger on my birthday. I like to get only one gift from my family on my birthday that otherwise I would never purchase myself. The Kindle fit the bill. I have been researching these ereaders for over one year and I can say without a doubt that the Kindle 2 is absolutely awesome... Its a whole new way of reading, and I have not found any downside to the Kindle vs. book format...so do not hesitate to make the jump...you will be happy you did.."
5,easy to use.,"For an 82 year old with arthritis in the fingers, this has been a God send. I don't have to hold a heavy book or turn pages but just enjoy reading by clicking a page turn or another to get to the menu. Absolutely amazing to be able to get newspapers, magazines and a myriad of other activities as well."
5,Never run out of books,I used to worry about running out of books but not any more since I purchased my Kindle.I have access to a wide variety of FREE e books through the Amazon site as well as many other sites. Find I am reading a wider variety of books and authors because of the Free Sample option which gives you the equivalent of about a chapter to read before you decide if you want to actually purchase the book. I compared other e-readers and am very satisfied with my Kindle.You will need to purchase a case for carrying your e-reader to protect it.
4,Like it,"Reading in bed was a problem because I read large books, and sometimes tend to go to sleep, and with ten pounds of book falling on my chest or dog, it tended be a problem. With the Kindle, when that happens I only get a nudge and reminder to put it down and go to sleep. I'm amazed by the technology that uses the cel-phone convenience rather than require the computers, WiFi, etc. I'll be using my Kindle a lot in the future."
1,SHORT life of Kindle - out 365$. DON't purchase!,"I am extremely dissapointed in Amazon and my Kindle - it is a year old and has been rendered ""dead"". It was well taken care ofAmazon customer service was not helpful at all. So my 365$ Kindle with multiple books purchased has lasted 13 months! It is NOT worth the Investment! Do not buy a kindle!"
1,Don't believe the hype,"I purchased my Kindle in July and really enjoyed it. Unfortunately, I dropped it and it landed on a corner just as in the demonstration on the Kindle promo site. The corner of the screen would no longer display. I called Amazon/Kindle customer service and they would not stand behind the product. They sent me a new Kindle for $135.00 I feel very badly about the lack of faith Amazon/Kindle has shown in their product. My Kindle was in a protective cover by M-Edge and did not fall more than 20 inches. The demonstration is more. The technology and the convience is great but the product is very fragile and I don't beleive that is represented in any promotional advertising I have seen. Be very careful if you buy one. They overall cost can be much greater that the $299.00.Kindle: Amazon's 6"" Wireless Reading Device (Latest Generation)"
5,Kindle Review..........,Purchase was efficient and good. I purchased the product and two days later the price changed. Amazon issued me a refund on the price difference which was fair and a great PR move.J.
5,LOVE my Kindle!,"I have had my Kindle for about a month now -- and I simply love it! The downloads take less than a minute... many titles are free or very inexpensive. I love the readability and convenience. In short, I couldn't be happier!"
2,Kindle-shipping,"I have bought 2 Kindles and ordered a 3rd for my daughter as a gift. The first 2 for my wife and myself arrived in 2 or 3 days. The 3rd one was ordered on 9-19-09 with an arrive date of 9-26-09 and I have still not received it! After calling they tell me shipping has been held up and If I don't have it by Friday Oct 2nd they will ship out another. I am very displeased! We do Love our kindles but we won't be ordering anything else that has to be shipped!Kindle: Amazon's 6"" Wireless Reading Device (Latest Generation)"
2,Kindle 2 - Not Ready For Primetime,I am sorry to say that I am returning my Kindle 2. I guess that I am guilty of not taking the time to fully review the capabilities and terms of this device. Here are my reasons for not liking the Kindle 2:1. You want to charge me to read a blog that I can read for free on my Netbook? What? Not.2. I can subscribe to my local newspaper for $3.25 a month. And they deliver it to my house. And you want to charge me $5.50 a month to read it on the Kindle? Not.3. You expect me to lug a book light around in case I happen to want to do some reading in low light? Not.And I get to pay almost $400 for this privilege AND I have to buy a case for it on top of the almost $400 cost? Not.No backlight? No thanks.
1,Failed after 2 days - what a present from Santa!!,"Hey all,If you are thinking about buying a kindle, I'd advise you to think twice. And then again. I managed to convince my husband that it was not just another electronic gimick and that it was the only thing I really wanted under the tree. Well, I indeed got it - only to have it COMPLETELY FREEZE after TWO DAYS!!When you call the support line, they are very helpful - they will refund you without question. Perhaps they think you'll be fooled twice??My advice? Keep your books.VERY UNHAPPY,C."
1,Review,"I like the kindle. But I failed to get two items, a book on Mao and a Townes Van Zandt tribute album. I tried to contact Amazon on the my account page and couldn't find a ""contact us"" button, so I am aggravated with Amazon right now and am unwilling to give you a product review."
4,PAT'S KINDLE REVIEW,"Positives: Easy to use, uncomplicated instructions, lightweight, easy to read. Overall it was so great I bought one for my sister.Negatives: No cover included, not as many of my favorite authors as I had hoped. No search capability and the typing at the bottom of the screen is unforgiving...spelling must be accurate...no guessing (Google is great at this). No ability to share with other Kindle users (my sister). How about using other e-book libraries???"
4,No volume control?!!!,"I'm only writing this review because I've seen no other mention of this problem in any other reviews (as far as I've read).When selecting the text-to-audio option and using ear buds plugged into the audio jack at the top of the Kindle 2 (a bottom location would have been much better), I found the volume uncomfortably loud with no way to decrease it! At least I haven't found a way up to now. Its hard to believe no one thought of providing a simple volume control.I guess I'll have to buy some type of plug-in listening device with an integrated volume control."
3,Kindle books available outside the US,Just a word of warning if you're thinking of buying this device outside of the US. The list of available books - particularly in Australia - is woeful. Don't be fooled by the so-called availability of New York Times best sellers; they are not offered to Australian buyers. The few decent titles they offer you probably already have in paper form. The rest are of the quality of a lending library in a bad neighborhood. Cute device but not really useful.
5,Blown Away,"Upon opening the box I was not sure on what to expect, but the fact that it was so light really shocked me. I didn't expect it to be so light. I LOVE the fact that it also saved my archived books that I had downloaded for the Mac Kindle application so I don't have to re-download those to the hand held Kindle. It is simple and easy to navigate around and get what you need easily. The screen is just like reading a paperback, the text is so crisp and clear it makes paperbacks look fuzzy. I know I will be spending a lot of time with the Kindle."
5,Why can't we get the same benefits in Canada?,"Love the Kindle, glad it FINALLY is available in Canada. Too bad all of the features can't be accessed. I was really looking forward to being able to email word and pdf documents only to find out that feature isn't yet available in Canada. Why the heck not???"
5,better than expected,"i bought the kindle for my wife for cmas. i didn't think i would like it. i was prejudiced.after she received it, i couldn't help but be curious about it so i started using it also, and i have simply changed my mind about it: it's great!it's easy on the eyes and comfortable to use. it's not heavy or awkward, like a book, and i don't have to worry about losing my page when i set it down for a moment. and when i'm reading a newspaper publication, i don't have huge pages that must be folded and bent into manageable shapes. i'm not particularly interested in color photos (the grayscale images are detailed enough for me) so i don't miss them. and there are still many classics i haven't read and they seem to be dirt cheap in e-form.i like it enough that i've decided to buy my own."
5,Be Nimble with Kindle,"Wow, What an amazing wireless reader.You really don't have to be a technical engineer to use this device. Loved the fast shipping! Loved the fact that it was set up and ready to download. Sixty seconds and the book you want is there...amazing. Love the fact that I can shop from my kindle.I conducted a staff development on the Kindle for my colleagues at work. Everyone was thrilled and ready to buy. If I could be a salesman for this device,I would! Thank You Amazon!"
5,Kindle 2: Wireless Reading Device,Kindle 2: Amazon's New Wireless Reading Device (Latest Generation)Just finished my first novel. Convenient and compact. Carry my library of books with me easily.
5,WAY more than I expected!,"This Kindle 2 is great! yes, it does all that the hype tells you, but I enjoy it with some other perks too. You can sit there and turn pages with only one finger....doesn't sound like much, but if you have arthritis it changes you from a non-reader back to a reader.You can prop it up, even sideways, and read in bed and not worry.....love that!My friend needed to buy expensive large print books and finds that is no longer necessary with the changable font sizes in the Kindle. She can read again!I can pack 1500 (if I had that many) books to take on a trip --- or if I ""forgot"" can order while on a trip straight from the Kindle 2. Now going on a cruise I may be out of luck on ordering, so will make sure I have all my books loaded before hitting the pier! LOL!Yes, I love it!!!!Anna"
5,A Christmas Gift,"My daughter-in-love is a reader--an avid reader. This past year she did a very special act of kindness. When my youngest son's wife began a difficult pregnancy, she was there to help. When the twins came early, and pretty dramatically--she twice took leave and drove 6 hours to help care for the new Mom, over-taxed husband, 4-year big sister, and two bouncing baby boys. She did this all without having to be asked. For that, I wanted her to have a special surprise at Christmas, and the Kindle did the trick. She was estatic, and loves her Kindle!"
5,Kindle 2 Reader,I researched all the other electronic readers and decided on the Kindle 2. I am very pleased with my decision.
5,kindle,"This is the I ever have, it's a must have... The only thing it should have come with a build in light, but other then I love my kindle , me and my husband own one... We read allot more also."
4,Kindle Review,"I received my Kindle in 2/10 and mostly just love it. The wireless connection is really great and the download speeds are as advertised. I chose a Kindle over the Nook based on other people's reviews I had read. I would enjoy, however, being able to loan books to my friends after I have finished with them. Also, I would like it to have a chip to archive my books rather than having to download them again after I have archived them. I had one problem losing internet connection, but the technical support people were wonderfully helpful when I called and walked me though re-establishing wireless connection."
5,I can't be without my Kindle!!!!,"I have to say... Kindle has to be my favorite gadget. My fiancee gave it to me for x-mas, and I haven't been able to put it down. Easy to read, easy to save, easy to download, good priced books. I can't say enough about how much I love my Kindle. The only time I don't have it in my purse is when my fiancee sneaks it out to read some of the books I've downloaded. now he's hooked on it himself and downloads books as well. I think eventually he will need his own. :)If you've been undecided on what to get, I will tell you my honey does a ton of research and comparisons. He told me after he gave me the Kindle that he was undecided between the Nook and the Kindle. The deciding factor was based on ease of use, clarity of screen, flexibilty of downloads, price of books, and compatibility.Don't take my word for it though.... read all 13K+++ reviews about the Kindle. I'm sure most will be very positive!!!!!! :)I.K."
4,Kindle 2,"I have been looking at the various reading devices that have come out over the past several years as I think this is the way all general printed books will eventually go, but I waited because something was just not right. I saw another woman's kindle and was impressed and when I got mine, it was love at first sight. There is so much written word out there that not everything is going to be available, but I think this is a great start. I am a convert. I totally love my Kindle and cannot see any down side yet. With my Kindle cover, it still has a look and feel of a book and fits nicely in my purse. The ink technology is easy to read and the instructions are easy to make a fast start to using your Kindle. Enjoy."
5,Great gift to myself WOW!!!,This Kindle has open new vistas. My favorite authors can only write so fast. This Kindle has so easily shown me authors I have never heard of. and given me a sample of their work. Great job Amazon I do love my Kindle.
4,Great to have available in Australia.,I've been looking forward to being able to have a Kindle available in Australia and have been very pleased by it's convenience and ease of use. I'm aware that we don't (yet) get the latest and bigger version but I'm happy with this one to start.We do however need to be able to access the larger volume of books like our American cousins. I note that this is caused by the publishers and each countries rules but standardisation can not come too soon on this matter.
5,Amazing. Best Customer Service Experience EVER.,"We received a Kindle II as a gift from a group about a year ago, and then accidentally broke it last week. We were SO sad--it is such a wonderful product. We had no idea who exactly bought it, or when, nor did we have any of the original docs. I called Amazon simply looking for an address to send it to be repaired, and after giving them just the email address through which we order books, they found our records, saw that it was slightly out of warantee, and still proceeded, unrequested, to ask for the info needed to send us a brand NEW one absolutely free, complete with shipping. I almost fainted! This has never happened to me before in my LIFE! My experiences with Apple customer service over the years have been nothing short of tears creating, much as I love my iPod. If you are considering a reading choice between the Kindle and the iPad, I have to say that this Amazon customer service experience would push me the Kindle way decisively."
2,"Global Kindle is not ""improved"" for some","I tried the Sony EReader & did not like it. I got the Nook, which looked great, however it would not even connect to register in the small rural community where I live (Olton, TX, 50 NW of Lubbock, TX)The cell phone service it used won't work here. At least 3 people in my town have Kindles and love them. So I got the Kindle. Since they purchased their Kindles, Amazon has changed to ""Global"" Kindle that uses AT&T cell phone service. It worked part of the time, and minimally. The USA Kindle that a local resident owns has displayed 3G service here (Sprint)-not my ""improved"" device. I asked if I could change for the USA version, no I cannot. A tech from Amazon thought he could switch cell providers for my device, but it is a hardware issue. It goes back today. Lesson: KNOW what cell service works where you live and verify Kindle uses that service. I believe only AT&T works with the Global Kindle."
4,"Great tool, but Amazon please learn Geography!","I am very happy to finally receive my Kindle. But living in Europe (Norway), what do I find when I open the package? A 110V US Power Plug! Amazon, seriously, I had expected something much more professional from an operation like this. We run on 220V with a differen universal plug that works all over Europe. Now I either need to pull an adapter with me all over, or charge from my PC.You manage to collect tax for the right country when ordering. But sending a 110V US plug to Europe? Come on, you can do much better if you want to be the global store for everything."
3,A godsend for constant readers,"One reason I gave 3 stars instead of more is the dim screen. It may be good outdoors, I wouldn't know, but indoors it's hard on the eyes. The best news is that, with a free app, I can read my Kindle books on my lighted iPod screen in any light conditions. I tried Kindle with the Mighty Brite book light but the glare was too annoying.In spite of the adjustable type size, I can't read without reading glasses. I had hoped the large print would be a little larger. Also, you can't adjust the print size on any of the menus or the home page, order page etc. On the positive side: Kindle is very easy to use, very fast download, lots of titles to choose from. I look forward to a lot less book clutter."
3,Great book substitute but not for graphs and charts,"I was very fortunate to receive a kindle as a gift today. I jumped online and purchased a couple of books. If you are reading novels or just plain text, this thing rocks . . . however, I am preparing for a new test in the network arena. This is where this thing falls really short. The screen captures and example images are way to small to read.I think the kindle should be color and touch screen before I was to look at this unit again.Please remember this is for my purpose. The kindle will probably work great for other readers that don't require lots of graphics and images.Great idea, concept and overall business plan on this whole kindle thing. I am sure Amazon has a winner on their hands."
1,Defective,"Free the Kindle Please, it has so much potential. Be a leader like you always have been, free the kindle."
1,Books made of paper are cheaper... why?,"The Kindle is a great concept. The lack of back up for subscription content is definitely a con. As is the weight. But the worst con of all is: Why are the electronic books so expensive?? The average paperback is only $7. That is with all the materials, shipping, etc... costs. An ebook is only digital data sent directly to the Kindle unit. Why is it $10+ a book?? I would much rather go to Barnes and Nobles and pick up a paperback. No back up issues and much cheaper. Until this is ironed out, no Kindle for me.."
5,I've become a true reader!,"This device makes reading accessible and interesting. Although I was a little skeptical how much I would use this device, the Kindle has gained importance status of the iPhone--coming with me everywhere I go. My husband and I both purchased ones after canceling our cable. Throughout the past six months, I have read several dozen books. The ease of the device is amazing, and if you travel very much, the convenience of purchasing books on the go is awesome. (I even bought books while sitting on the beach last summer.) The iPhone applications make the device more versatile. Truly, I can't say enough good things about this device. We live in an area that doesn't have a large bookstore or an adequate public library, so this device has truly been a lifesaver."
4,Kindle 3G,I am enjoying using my Kindle to read the books that I have downloaded. It arrived 3 days after I ordered it (that came from US to Australia) and 2 days before it was estimated to arrive. Excellent service. My only complaint is that there is a lack of Australian authors in the available content to download.
4,Kindle II,Great present for wife's birthday. She is enjoying it and it was easy for her to master. Instructions were clear and it is perfect for travel.
5,Love my Kindle!,"I absolutely love the convenience, size and ease of use of the new Kindle 2. However, there are a few drawbacks that I have found which include: books from my favorite authors that aren't on Kindle yet; typos and other grammatical errors in the written form placed on Kindle and being able to share my books that I have purchased with my immediate family. I'm sure this is the next greatest thing in book reading but hope that Amazon will ""tweak"" some of the concerns that myself and others have noted on our reviews."
3,Very expensive,"Good device, very expensive. I would not pay more than $99 for it.Bueno,pero muy caro. Yo no pagaría más de $99 por este lector de libros."
2,Cost,"I think the Kindle is a good idea, but just like anything else the price will come down...remember when a VCR was over $1,000. Well, when the Kindle makes it way down to a more reasonable price, I will consider buying one because I do love to read. Thank you."
2,Too Expensive,"I really want to buy a Kindle, however the only reason I have not is because of the price. The only thing holding me back is $359. If this device were $150-200 I would buy it without question, but currently it is over priced.Granted new products are always more expensive, however as the new ones continue to emerge, the price will undoubtedly remain the same.Please reconsider the base price of this device. I'm certain I'm not the only one with this thought."
3,Kindle just OK,"I finally received my Kindle 2 and was hoping that it would be life-changing in that I would make it a part of my daily life - it doesn't. Too bad, I think the Kindle 2 is a pretty cool toy, but I NEVER USE IT! I'm just too busy to pull out my Kindle 2 every day and read my USA Today subscription. One day I hope to use all the functionality on the Kindle 2, but right now I might as well sell it due to lack of use."
2,"2 stars for ""barely okay"" Let's aim higher Amazon!","As e-readers go, Kindle is just barely okay. I say barely because the electronic ink just does not work the magic one would hope for. Moderately dark text on a moderately light background remind me of a cheap paperback book from the 1960s, rather than the crisp post-modern e-text of today. Internet access, although in ""beta"" was not even sketchy. Archaic, hard to manipulate navigation buttons and a QWERTY keyboard that is too big to thumb and too small to type on, also contribute to the 2 star rating. I sold my Kindle, barely used, on Amazon for about 1/2 of what I paid for it. Won't try again until: 1) Crisper, readable, full-color, adjustable text is standard. 2) Internet access is brought kicking and screaming into the 21st century and it is possible to access e-mail without having to use a recipe book. 3) Better navigation and typing tools are developed. I don't think it will be a long wait. Kindle 4 or 5, I expect."
1,Upset over Amazons post purchase corporate policies,This item (Kindle) was purchased as a graduation gift for a student.Imagine my surprise when I begans getting charges for books that were downloaded on my account.I did not authorize these purchases but Amazon made it easy for the recipient to charge books to the account from which I initially purchased the Kindle.How can you allow this to happen.There is a flaw in your system and I for one want to see it rectified.
3,"Love kindle, but buying a Nook now","I love my kindle. I bought kindle 1, and upgraded to kindle 2, and love it even more for extended battery life and ease of use. However--kindle is a device I use for reading my books. I read 4-8 books per week, and don't want to have the physical books to lug around and clutter my house. The ongoing war Amazon is having with the publishers has seriously cut into my ability to read books by my favorite authors on my kindle. I don't care that Amazon is discounting these books in hardback or paperback--I bought the kindle so I wouldn't have to have the physical books to deal with. It has been months, and the list of books I have not been able to read is getting longer and longer. Meanwhile, these books are available on other platforms. So, I guess I'm going to archive my kindle, and give my thousands of dollars of revenue to Barnes and Noble instead. In the fight between Amazon and the publishers, the consumers and the authors are losing."
2,Money Pit,My kindle was given to me as a gift. I enjoy reading and thought this was a wonderful devise to use when I travel. After using my kindle.. I think it is a money pit. I can go to my local library and get current books for free vs. paying the cost Amazon charges to download a book. I can also return a library book. On the kindle I am stuck with it unless I plan on reading it over and over again. I checked at the library since they have free downloads of books...but of course they can't be downloaded to my kindle. Not looking a gift horse in the mouth because the cost of the kindle is expensive...but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone on a limited budget.
2,Kindle,"I am not really able to review this product, because it is a birthday present that I haven't given yet. I did want to say that Amazon should have some way of extending the period that a warranty can be purchased when the item bought is a gift. I know my daughter would want to purchase a warranty for her new Kindle, but Amazon would only offer the purchase of the warranty up to 2 weeks after the purchase of the item. This will severly limit using this web site at Christmas time, as you don't have much of a window to purchase a warranty. So I'm not sure if she would rate the product higher, but my rating is for the warranty purchase period. I'm not satisfied with this aspect of the product."
3,Subscription Concerns,"I am impressed with the technology. After seriously considering the Kindle for some time, I opted not to purchase it. My reasons are simply that I don't like the price. I wish that I could have a less-costly, WIFI-reliant device."
3,"books, books, books",I would buy this in a flash and one for each of my children IF the cost of downloading the books was $5. or below. clf
3,why oh why does it have to cost so much?!,I'd love to have something like this as I'm a read-freak (hubby's term)...but the expense is waaayyyy over my head! will it ever come down?
1,"You will pay, but will not own","There are two major problems with the Kindle. First, Amazon caved to the Author's Guild (google [roy blunt kindle] for the story) by removing support for synthesized speech of any book on the device. This is not only anti-consumer, but is an affront to individuals who are vision-impaired. Second, it has sufficient DRM that Amazon can lock people (and has! Google [Amazon Kindle DRM consumerist] for the story) out of their device at their whim. There is no due process, and no appeal. Any consumer who purchases this device gets what is coming to them. Until Amazon realizes that their allegiance should be to their *customers*, you should not buy this device."
1,Can't read e-books borrowed from library,"I consider Kindle 2 as a reading device, but Amazon seems use it as a book shopping device.Using Kindle, you would not be able to read the e-books that borrowed from public library.Dear Amazon, can you explain why?"
1,"Amazon, please remove the DRM.","I would like a Linux eBook reader, and the Kindle looks the nicest I've seen, but I will not buy one with DRM embedded into it. Amazon, please remove the DRM from this device and you'll have a happy purchaser. Thanks,Jeremy Allison."
4,Good; would be great if I could share books with my partner,"Love my Kindle 2. But I am used to sharing books with my partner, and now can't do that. In addition to buying another Kindle, we'd have to pay separately for all of the books. So, for now, there'll be no 2nd Kindle purchase in this family."
5,The Most outstanding thing I ever bought in my life...,"I love to read and this Kindle Book device has only made life for me so much better out here in Japan. It's hard to carry a library around when I am overseas, and packing is left spartan. With the Kindle I can have my cake and eat it too, I can read, or have stories read to me when my time is short.Kindle is awesome, if you are thinking of getting one, I highly recommend it..."
5,Amazing,"I have had my kindle 2 since Christmas of 09. It has given me the best reading experience I have ever had and I would recommend anyone wanting one to get it. I have read so many books since I got it and I know there will be a lot more. I also want to say, if your thinking about getting the nook don't, I went to try it out and the response time is horrible, it is not what it is all cracked out to be. I will stick with Amazon kindle all the way, they are the first ones to make an e-book reader that downloads books wirelessly and all others are just imitations"
5,Bought this for the wife at Christmas,"I got the Kindle 2 for my wife at Christmas, and she still hasn't stopped raving about it. Easy to use, easy to purchase and download new books (I should know, she's already gone through over 15 books since she got it!), long battery life and on and on. I see her constantly reading from it and only charging it like once a week. I just wish they could make a cell phone with that kind of battery life!"
5,Looove it.,"I read 25- 30 books a year. I got an Amazon Kindle, 6"", for Christmas. Having used it for 5 months now, all I can say is I love it. Reading is pleasant, shopping and buying books is wonderful. I used to read e-books on a backlit screen (a palm pda) and e-ink is a much better reading experience."
1,Turned off by DRM,"I love everything about the Kindle. I've borrowed one and played with it for hours. I will get one in heartbeat, once it's DRM-free."
2,no light - darn,"I received a kindle 2 as a gift. I was delighted. In general, I love it. But, alas, I was disappointed when I attempted to read in the middle of the night. I just assumed there would be a backlight, similar to the one on my Palm Pilot. I used a very nifty clip-on booklight instead. The light made a glare off of the screen and there was no angle that I could strike to eliminate the problem. As a 'night-reader' this is enough to make me question whether the kindle is a practical device for me. I will look at other lights, perhaps one made specifically for kindle."
1,"Might be a great product, but doesn't work outside the US","I was allowed to purchase the Kindle 2 with no issues, but when it came time to buy books, I was told that the licensing agreement on ebooks only applies to the US and since I was in Canada, I would not be able to download any books. Kind of makes the Kindle useless, so I sent it back. Too bad, looks like a good product and specifically liked the feature of having the Kindle recite a book (good for those of us who get car sick, reading). Hopefully they'll resolve the licensing issue soon."
5,Thumbs up for Me!,"I purchased this for my husband for Christmas. He loves to read and I thought it would be a great way for him to continue what he loves to do and continue his traveling for work as well. He loves the flexiblity it gives him to have all of his book with him at all times. It is very light and easy for him to handle. He has enjoyed the note taking option it gives, along with the highlighting factor, dictionary, thesaraus, and the overall ability to listen to the voice activated technique when he is driving. I spent a lot of time comparing all of the E Readers availabe right now, and the Kindle came up hands down the best quality for the value. Very well please and excited that My Christmas Gift was the winner."
3,Good and not so good,"Good things about the Kindle Reading Device are the portability of having many books available on demand.Ordering from Amazon is easy - not so easy from the device, but easy from my computer.The screen is very easy on your eyes. I've had no problems at all with glare.Things I don't like about my Kindle are that I can't share books with friends. If I bought a hardcover or paperback book, I could pass it along - I can't do that now. There is no file sharing.Also, if I want to check a fact or something I read earlier in a text, it's very slow and time consuming to page back one page at a time instead of just flipping pages."
1,Screen failed,"In early March i got my First Kindle and loved it. It was wonderful....for 2 weeks. Then in the middle of reading the screen goes to the sleep mode and freezes. SO I called customer service and was told I could return it for a replacement. So I have had my second kindle for about a month. In the middle of reading THE SCREEN WENT BLANK AND WILL NOT TURN ON! My kindle is fully charged, has never been dropped, and I don't let it sit in the sun. This is rediculous! I feel totally ripped off! I Suggest that anyone wanting to buy a kindle.... DON'T DO IT!!!!!!!"
1,Half of my screen doesn't work. This thing is useless,"I enjoyed my Kindle 2 and had it just over a year. I read perhaps 14 books during that time. One time I went to use it and the entire lower half of the screen was covered with black lines that no amount of manipulation could resovlve. It navigated just fine, but the entire kindle is useless given that you can't read the bottom half of each page. It's just out of warranty and I'm disappointed. Unless Amazon will somehow help me out, I won't buy another kindle."
4,Age no barrier,"I bought a Kindle for my 81 yr old father. I noticed he had stopped reading because he has trouble holding books and, sometimes, even the newspaper as he has arthritis and peripheral neuropathy. He loves the Kindle which is light and no trouble to hold or rest on his lap or a table. As a consequence he has been able to get back into reading and is in the middle of the Steig Larsson series. The adjustable font is also wonderful for aging eyes. I was worried that the 5 way controller might be tricky but he is coping. It might be an idea if there was some thought to a version that had controls that weren't as finicky for those with less than nimble fingers. My husband now also has a Kindle as he is in the Navy. He can take as many books as he likes away with him without worrying about how much space they will take up and buy new ones when he needs to. There are a multitude of uses for this device and age and infirmity can be a reason to buy one, not a limitation."
5,I'd have left a review sooner but I've been too busy reading :),"I received my Kindle as a gift 11 months ago. Since then I've given it as a gift to my husband, my 83 year old mother and my sister. This e-reader is easy to use, Kindle Customer Service is worth a 10-star review, and the number and variety of books is incredible. I could go on for pages about how wonderful the Kindle is but here are the major pluses for me: The built in dictionary is more useful than I imagined. The variety of books, especailly from the independant writers and small publishers, is amazing. Kindle Customer Service is unparalleled, they are knowlegable, responsive and helpful. I have saved the cost of the Kindle many times over in the free books and inexpensive books. The Kindle is definately worth the cost. What an amazing device!"
5,Really can read in the sun,The kindle lives up to all the positive reviews I read before purchasing it. I found the technology very user friendly.
4,A new kindle user,"I bought two kindles at the same time, one for my husband and one for me, so we can share reading the same books. We both like our kindles but I have the following comments. 1) I would like the background to be a little lighter. I find the gray to be dreary. 2) We are really impressed with the download speed and look forward to taking them on vacation instead of 8 or 10 paperback books!"
3,Regular user,"Good:Ability to read e-booksBad: 1. Unable to change contract on display.2. No light. 3. Need to keep in the hand only? No Case, no Kindle_keeper on the table 4. Unable to change battery. 5. Unable to listen music and read the book in one time 6.No card reader port - 2 gigs are good for book only but not for mp3 or audiobooks.Very bad: The KIndle does not supported for most of formats.Very-very bad: does not support for different languages ( in PDF only ! ). I'm tried to read for example russian books and cannot because the system supported for english only! lso, Users are unable to increase the text format in PDF .The Kindle need ASAP for all user; provide some software to create a PDF files ( pdf 6) with change font size."
2,excessive typos,"My complaint of 100's of typos in a specific kindle book resulted in customer service asking me to detail each typo giving exact typo and page number. That will take longer than it took to read the annoying copy. Quality control is seriously lacking, as is common sense from customer service."
2,Many Books Not Available on Kindle !,I am so disappointed with the Kindle book selections. I got my Kindle for Christmas and already two books that I wanted to purchase are not available on Kindle. I should have researched more before making this purchase. Out of the supposed THOUSANDS of books on Kindle I managed to pick TWO in the same week that are not available! Major downer!
1,When is the Mac version coming out?,When is the Mac version coming out? Those of us who love our Macs have been waiting too long. How much longer must we wait?
4,Kindle Review,I am quite pleased with my Kindle 2. It allows me to carry quite a lot of books and the selection of books on Amazon is very good. I've been able to read qite a few out of print classics. Thanks for a great ereader.
5,Perfect Birthday Gift!,"I purchased the Kindle for my daughter's 21st birthday. For the girl that has most everything, this was a great choice for a voracious reader. And, it's a lot lighter in her backpack."
5,Amazon Kindle,"This kindle is wonderful. It is easy to use, and all your books are in one location, and ready at your convenience."
5,Buenísimo!!!,"I am not a gadgets fan. In fact, I had many doubts before buying the Amazon Kindle, but now that I have it I am really satisfied with it. Before that, I used to read stuff in my laptop and, as you know, you can't take your laptop everywhere. With the kindle I can read in my car, in my bed, in the park and wherever I want.Text is extremely clear and easy to read. The ""experimental"" services, like internet connection and MP3 listening are OK. The ""Whispernet"" to download books from Amazon is extremely fast.Battery is long lasting and downloading books or texts from your computer is fast and easy.I would like a lower price for ebooks in Amazon and a bigger catalogue in Spanish, as I live in México.In very few words: Kindle is a great option for ebook readers."
4,LOVE KINDLE & GOT CREDIT FOR DIFFERENCE,"I ordered my Kindle 2 on 10/2/09 for $299 and received it 10/6/09. Read article and reported on news that Kindle dropped its price to $259 (U.S. wireless). I immediately called Amazon customer service, and received $40 credit. Although I'm extremly pleased with my Kindle 2, for the price it should be bundled with a basic leather or leather-like Amazon's Kindle cover, skin/sock/shock proof covering with color options, and slim book light. Hopefully they are working on updating Kindle with a touch screen, backlight, and extending the battery time if using the backlight. I' not proficient with it yet and So far it's working very well and find it very easy to use. I haven't used it in my bookclub yet so I'm not sure how to mark pages to discuss in our reading circle. My 10 yr old likes it, but this is one device of mine that he will not have access to. He has completely taken over my iPod Touch!"
5,Kindle 2,"Kindle 2 is a great device for those who like to read. It is compact, books are easily downloaded, and best sellers are almost immediately available. I only wish that there would be more text to speech books available."
4,Invaluable LookUp feature for (especially) non-native speakers!,"I cannot speak of the latest edition, but I suppose I can speak of a feature that is available for all editions.As a non-native English speaker, I found the Lookup feature tremendously helpful, or I have to go side by side with a hard-copy dictionary. For the most part, I can follow stories (novels to science textbooks) without the aid, but once in a while, I encounter new words. With this feature and the convenience of carrying multiple books without adding weight in my parse, I found myself reading way more books than before. Sure, the dictionary feature in Kindle 1 is crippled in some ways, but it's better than nothing."
1,what happens when you lose your kindle,"Amazon has no way to track your lost or stolen kindle so you are simply out of luck! Since the portability of this product is its main virtue, you really need to keep track of it. I managed to use mine for only 3 months and it disappeared even though I had my name and address on it!"
2,Pretty Good But Too Many Drawbacks,"Received Kindle 2 as a gift and used for three weeks. The Good: fast download, good screen contrast in sun, space efficientThe Not So Good: no charts, graphs or pictures; VERY expensive ( a 1974 book was $11.97 Kindle and $ 4.99 delivered new on Amazon), some authors will not post their works on Kindle, occasionally abridged vs the book, two year additional warranty is really one year, fragileIn short, a good idea but rush to market leaves lots of features behind."
2,Cost,Too bad Kindle isn't priced like the Apple Nano to get you hooked and then sell the books. Price is too high to give to family and friends easily.
1,Agree that it is too expensive.,"I am tempted to purchase the Kindle 2, but it seems that I need to purchase it at$350 so I can have the ability to purchase books I can read on it for $10.00 each.I had the same reservations about the I-pod, but at least with an mp3 player, I can play my existing CD collection on it. There would be no way for me to ""import"" my existing books onto a kindle.I'll consider the Kindle when the price drops to something reasonable."
5,The Kindle is amazing!,I have owned my Kindle for a full month. It provides me with the ability to have a book to read at all times. I will never have to go anywhere again to buy another book. There are many features that appeal to the reader in me. The instant dictionary allows me to find the meanings of words that I do not know. I would recommend a Kindle for any avid reader of any age. Its ease of use is another plus for the Kindle. I am not technology savvy but I was able to figure out how to use the Kindle.
5,Kindle 2--My new best friend!,"I have always been a ""book"" person. Loved the whole tactile experience of buying, reading and collecting books. So I am shocked that I have fallen in love with my Kindle 2. Here is why: I can make the type larger (great for tired eyes). I can look up definition of any word instantly (no more, ""oh I'll look that up later""). I can go to Wikipedia for more research without reaching for my laptop. I have been able to download any book I've wanted to read instantly (and I mean instantly!), I can get sample chapters of books mentioned by friends and save as a future reading list to buy later. I can take my library with me. (Kindle is very pocketbook friendly.) I am looking at my stack of traditional books now and wishing they were on my Kindle. And I swear I am reading much faster on my Kindle. Any drawbacks? Well, to be honest, I still like to see the original cover art so I check out the covers on Amazon or local bookstore. Get one. It is the best!"
3,PDF's,Having just recieved my brand new kindle I was so pleased I thought its going to be great to be able to view all the PDF docs that I have. Only to discover that although I can load them. I can't change the viewable size. Thus making it almost impossible to actually read them. So the kindle is great for ebooks its no good for PDF's. So anybody wanting a kindle for PDF viewing.... give t a miss
5,Wonderfully Magnificent!!,"Was a little worried as to what I was getting. I did the research, but you never know what you are getting until you actually get it. Now that I have had it for a few months I do not know what I would do without it. I have read over a dozen books on it already, and saved nearly one hundred dollars on books... so really the kindle will pay for itself in under a year.Downside: Not all books are available, I think Amazon should make all books available for our kindles, even if they release them at publishers price, they can negotiate later. I just know that there are quite a lot of books I would even pay full price for, but I want them on my kindle, not on paper (yes, it is that much more convenient)."
1,Amazon burned us AND our books!,"""Big"" Amazon broke into our homes and used our books as ""Kindle""ing for their fire. It's time to take a hint from Farenheit 454 and find an alternate way to keep our books alive.The empty ""PR""omise of ""We won't do that again"" is likely not true. They need to return 1984 and Animal Farm to their victims AND permanently put the customer in charge of transfer of data to and from the device. And this means to and from ""local"" storage or a new Kindle or other reader device. Pirating issues should be between the customer and the ""BIAA"".Until then ... DO NOT SPEND A SINGLE PENNY ON KINDLE PRODUCTS."
3,Omitted key Kindle 1 features on the Kindle 2,"There are really good improvements in the Kindle 2.I really like the audio features and the improved search features.However, I miss the content manager ... I would like to see the entire list of my books and what I have in the Amazon repository.And I REALLY miss the dots beneath the book titles on my Home page indicating how much of the book I have read. It is a way I can tell immediately if I have read the book."
1,"An ebook I can't control, ebooks I don't","Amazon's software allows them not only to delete books at any time, but also to cripple them -- as they did recently when they disabled the ""read aloud"" Text to Speech feature on already purchased titles."
1,DEFECTIVE BY DESIGN!,"The kindle is the next greatest thing since the Sony root kit.You dont really own your books. Amazon can delete them from the hardware you purchased with software they installed on it with out your permission. The least they could do is let you know that it is on the Kindle and what it is capable of.How would you feel if you woke up one morning and all of your favorite books had dissappeared off the shelves in your house. The DRM in the Kindle can do just that. They proved it with the great Kindle Swindle by deleting books that people had paid for. What is amazon's policy for refunding the money your customers had stolen from them when you deleted their books?defectivebydesign, kindle swindle, and 1984."
1,RIPOFF,"Amazon can delete the books you buy remotely. Total ripoff, won't buy one. Ironic that the book was 1984."
4,Kindle and future books -Never look back,"I realize that e-readers will evolve and the product will be significantly better in the future but I decided to start with todays Kindle. E-books take some getting use to, several min. at least. Perhaps what I like best, is the ability to examine a book pretty thoroughly via reviews before I invest my money and time into a book. Book samples are a great idea to help you make a decision to purchase a book and of course free books are also a big plus.I hear about Amazon's disputes with the publishers and I think this is a normal evolutionary process that will eventually determine a true market value. The publishers will decide the balance between large profits on fewer books or little profits on many books. I hope their smart enough to be designing the business models today, so soon Kindle users will have access to all books."
3,E-books now cost too much...,"I was thrilled to receive a Kindle for my birthday last summer. I am a big reader and having it with me all the time was wonderful. (For some reason, it's better for non-fiction.) I didn't like not being able to pass books along to others--one of the pleasures of reading is sharing--but it seemed like a fair trade off for the lower price of an e-book. Imagine my chagrin when I went to buy a book the other day on my Kindle and it cost $17, only a few dollars less than the hardcover! And more than a paperback! I know publishers and Amazon are trying to work this out, but until they do, anyone contemplating a Kindle should do the math, which doesn't look so great anymore."
4,Barb's Kindle Review,"I like the Kindle, although it takes some getting used to. I wish the Kindle had page numbers, rather than locations and percentages, this does not help me find where I last was. Sometimes the Kindle flips off and goes back to home and I lose where I was, so to find my previous location I have to hunt (rarely do I remember the chapter number). I would like to hold (bookmark?) a page to be able to go back to it repeatedly (flip back and forth) while I continue reading, I don't know if that's possible."
3,nice but slow,"I like my Kindle but it is pretty slow. Reading a book is very nice and clear to read. However, moving around is slow and other features that I am still trying to learn are also slow. It is really nice to read a book on this unit because it is light and can increase the size of print to make it easy to read. I am happy with it and would tell others to get one."
2,Disappointed!,"I received my Kindle 2 as a present. I had not heard anything about this product before I received it. After it was explained to me what it was, I thought ""Great""! I am an avid reader, but after having my Kindle for two month's I am disappointed. I thought when I first got it that I could now read in bed without turning on a light, but it is not back-lit as I would have thought it would be. Also, even though I can adjust the font size, I find it is very hard on my eyes. I am always blinking alot and just straining my eyes to see better. Another annoyance is the battery icon. It is a very light grey color and hard to see how close it is to needing recharged. For the price, I think you could do better."
1,Australian Customers Beware,"The Kindle device itself works very well, but the quality and quantity of available books is poor. Whilst >100,000 books are available, most are from second tier publishers. Many new releases and popular books are not available to Australian customers.The Kindle book store is deceptive, as a search reveals books not available in Australia. I suggest that before you buy the Kindle, have a search for the type of books you like. If they appear in the Kindle bookstore, be sure to click through to the book page and see if they are available for purchase from Australia - many are not.Hopefully Amazon will rectify this problem. In the meantime, buyer beware."
2,Troubling,It is disturbing to learn that Amazon retains the ability to delete any book from the kindle even after it has been paid for at anytime for any reason.
4,Kindle,Love it - but it has a tendancy to turn itself on after some time and then the battery runs down.
4,Best Gift that I have ever had!,"I am completely addicted to the kindle! I have the smaller white version. The best thing is that you automatically obtain the book you want at the time that you want it. You also do not have to pay for shipping and handling. You can also return a book that you do not like within a seven day period just by e-mailing Amazon. It is also nice to have a dictionary where to just put the cursor on the word and you have the definition without having to flip a page!There are two downsides to the kindle. One is the fact that there are no page numbers and that makes it very difficult to cite books in the MLA format for graduate school. Secondly, it does not have a light already on the kindle, which would be very convenient. Color would also be a good addition.The Kindle is the best gift that I have ever received. I love being able to buy books when I am in the mood to read them! This is a great buy!"
4,Kindle Review,"I throughly enjoy using my new Kindle. The convience of downloading a book and especially a ""sample"" before I purchase is great. The only small negative I have encountered is the next page button must be firmly depressed to work."
5,Kindle,"I am most definitely satisfied with my Kindle. My only problem is not with the Kindle but with the books I have received. They are many words not printed correctly. They are in every book that I downloaded. The word will be separated into two words instead of the one as it should be. Almost as if someone who doesn't know English is typing the manuscript.Example: The Scarpetta Factor,location 7313-15 ca maro instead of camaro and location 7573-75 cho reographed instead of choreographed. These are only two instances but I found the same problem in all of the books. Other than that I love my Kindle and would advise everyone to try the Kindle as I have. Bonnie Mann"
4,"It's almost ""there""","I love the size. I love getting books without giving up bookshelf room for them. I love instant delivery. I love previews before I buy. I love magazine subscriptions that don't kill trees. I love having dozens of different kinds of things to read with me, without having to carry a suitcase full of stuff. I love the charger cord, that is one *seriously* inspired piece of engineering. I love being able to change the font size depending on how tired my eyes are.I don't much care for how it ""turns pages"", the way it blacks out the screen each time is a little hard to get used to. They claim you can get two weeks from a charge... sure, if you don't read much, but why would you buy a Kindle if you didn't read much?I'm hoping more periodicals create a Kindle edition. There are tons of newspapers, but not all that many of my favorite magazines."
4,Blockbusters and batteries,"My library has morphed into the palm of my hand and at the same time I'm saving the planet by no longer having to purchase paper books! That's the great aspect of Kindle. Sort of... The range of books available electronically in Australia is abysmal! No Dan Brown, Matthew Reilly (and he's Australian), Steve Berry. The adventure/thriller category consists of books that I could buy for $2.99 in the throw out (remainder) bin at the local newsagent. And why didn't Amazon ship the Kindle with an adaptor - if Apple can do it, then why not with the Kindle?I still love it to bitz though!Rating: Kindle 9/10Media available to read on it: 1/10"
5,customer service,"After enjoying my Kindle for several months, the product ceased to operate for no reason. I contacted customer service and after trouble shooting with me, the representative explained that he would be mailing a new Kindle to me, which will arrive the following day and also e-mailed a postage paid shipping label for the damaged Kindle. Their customer service was great (I did not loose any of the purchased material on my Kindle). I would advise not to hesitate to purchase this product."
1,Grande deception,"J'ai passé environ 5 heures avec le Kindle qui est remisé je ne sais mme plus ou depuis le lendemain de son achat.SUR LA LA LITTERATURE EMPORTÉE1- Pas de couleur (j'attends avec impatience le produit Apple qui devrait faire la mme chose en beaucoup mieux)2- Ecran trop petit3- Rien ou à peu près rien en Franais4- Système de recherche, notations, table des matières, indexation peu pratiqueSUR L'UTILISATION EN STOCKAGE D'INFORMATIONS PROFESSIONNELLES (Tarifs, Documentation, Petites archive à emporter)1- Formats difficiles à régler (pdf en particulier)2- Perte de l'information couleur3- Système de recherche, notations, table des matières, indexation peu pratiqueDonc . . . j'ai abandonné. Je pense qu'il est rangé dans le mme placard que le Newton"
1,Kindle isn't International at All,"I must say i'm very disappointed with Kindle. It seems not to be so ""international"" at all.I live in Brazil, in a full whispernet covered area (according to amazon.com), but my Kindle simply can't connect to internet. Meaning that i can't receive the books i bought from kindle store. I'm sure Kindle is a fantastic gadget in US (or wherever it functions correctly), but if you plan to use your kindle outside US, think twice before buying it, because you might be really, very, disappointed.I've contacted amazon before writing this review, and i've done everything they told me so (reset, restart, charge, check if wirelles is on...) but the kindle still couldn't connect.Maybe Kindle may become a beautiful picture on your wall. And that's all."
1,You do not own any book you buy for Kindle! Boycott tethered media!,"The terms of service gives Amazon, NOT YOU, the ownership of the books on your Kindle. Do not support ""tethered media,"" especially under the terms Amazon mandates. They have removed George Orwell and Ayn Rand books from people who have purchased them, it's like if you went to Border's and bought a book, then later, claiming copyright issues, employees from Border's came into your house and took the book back.Do not buy tethered media for any device. Companies can go into your computer and remove data whenever they want under the terms of service tethered media requires. If I buy a book, I want to own the book... now it's like paying $10 to rent a book from your library, not a great deal. You are only leasing your e-books, and they can take them back whenever they choose (and they have).The Kindle hardware is adequate, but the terms of service should be a deal-killer for anyone paying attention."
1,This is not a review it is a complaint about your Kindle policies.,"Dear Executives of Amazon.com,Tell me please, is it so hard to setup an operation in Turkey, so that kindle devices and kindle books can be purchased from here like in all places in your list? At least give the right to people who purchased their devices from US. to download kindle books over the web while they are in Turkey. Don't you wanna make money? By the way, why is there no email address or no web forum in your site for people to post their complaints to. As far as I understood this is not a place for posting complaints. This message is not a review it is a complaint.Kerem Sarioglu"
4,VA Hospital use,I go to the VA Hospital a great deal and like to read. I put a lot of thought into buying this...I bought it and a week later it was $50.00 cheaper...just my luck. You cannot use it in the dark. You have to buy a case for it just for safety. It charges either with a wall socket or computer with a cord provided. Still learning how to use it.
5,"MAGNIFICENT - What a ""Godsend"" for the voracious reader","Okay, no sense in dwelling on the few (if any conceived) negatives on this amazing device - suffice to say if you are as a voracious reader as I am, (recently cancelled 3 online book clubs after receiving my new Kindle 2), then you really need to suck it up, (yes it is expensive) and purchase one of these things.....You can read all of the reviews....worry thru the few negative comments from other owners, or you can take the plunge and discover an entirely new way to indulge in your favorite hobby....My god, I am 62 years old with poor eyesight, and never conceived my ageless love of reading could be improved upon such as this.....TRY IT - YOUR GONNA LOVE IT!!!"
5,IN LOVE WITH MY NEW KINDLE!!!,"I am sooo happy! I just got my K2 today after waiting from December and it was worth the wait! It is even better than I thought it would be. It's comfortable to hold, sturdier than I thought it would be and the buttons are strong and secure. The functions are complete and the K2 holds for me everything I could want. Being an avid reader since I can remember and carrying 4 or 5 books around with me made this venture completely worth it. I am going to sleep with a smile on my face tonight!"
5,The K2 Rocks,"I am a first time Kindle owner so I don't know about improvements or comparrisons, but I know that I love the K2 I am amazed at how you don't notice your not reading a actual book you really do see past the screen I love the fact that you really don't have to be tech savy to use the k2 it's easy to operate I down loaded some mp3s to it and I can listen to museic while I read the quality of the sound text to speech and music is great in my opinion for a e reader. the e ink is amazing it looks like a page from a book you really can't tell the difference. Over all I am so happy with the k2 I was worried about spending the money on a product I have never touched or knew any thing about, but I am so happy I did.:)"
3,Problem with power plug in..,"I like my new Kindle - I'm pretty much addicted to it but the power plug in that goes into the Kindle won't stay plugged in. It's like it's the wrong size or something and I have to prop it to keep it in the Kindle. If I don't use something to prop the plug in, it won't charge and I end up with a dead battery, just when I'm ready to read. That's really frustrating. If that would work, I'd give my Kindle 5 *****...but..can't."
1,"nice device and selection, but multiple failures","I bought this as a gift for someone else because of the selection and variety of ebooks in categories they like. However; within the first day using it, the screen failed, prompting a return. Now; a second device has failed within a couple days of her using it; and this replacement is costing. The devices have gone to the house and the pool; not having been dropped or gotten wet at all. Not happy with two in a row having issues, kinda dissappointed in the QA process for the hardware."
1,"After replacement, still does not work",First one I received was defective. The replacement was defective. No more Kindles for me.
3,Bom produto. Recomendo,"O Kindle é um bom e-reader e recomendo o seu uso. Aprimoramentos sero muito bem vindos (cr, velocidade, conectividade etc...)."
3,good but could be better,I have two Kindles. I love them both BUT ATT is NO good for your whispernet or whatever you call it. I am in Montana and NE and ATT does no service these areas. why you aren't with verizon is beyond meif you were and i could actually download books on the kindle without using my computer it would be a 5 star. But it is a pain to have to go thru the hassle of computer to Kindle. rph
3,Limited access to new books,"I do love my Kindle; however, as I live in Canada, I often find that I cannot download some new books because they are not available to Canadian users, even if I am in the US. While most of the time, the same books are available from Sony Reader. I also agree with another customer who noted the fact that you cannot lend books to fellow Kindle users. Sharing books is available on some other e-reader devices."
5,Kindle II,"I LOVE MY KNIDLE II. I don't care what other e-books are out there, none can compare to this one. I am always reading something on my Kindle. This was the best birthday gift my husband could have purchased for me. I LOVE IT!!!!!"
4,Great product,Since I bought it i have been reading a lot more. I have read 4 books in only 1 month and I was reading about 1 book or less a month. The internet capabilities are low and it is really slow to surf the web.
5,"Kindle Wireless Reading Device (6"") Display","I love my Kindle. I have been showing it off to all my friends and family,who also love to read. I was disappointed that I was not able to download my local paper and also some of my favorite magazines. Amazon does not tell you that there are a limited number of papers and magazine you can subscribe to. I hope that Amazon does expand the selection. One of the reasons I purchased Kindle was to that I can read the paper and magazines without having to purchase them at the store."
5,Best thing I have owned in years.,"I got this for my wedding anniversary, as I recently started reading books again. I am a speed reader and finished the twilight series in 5 days. So the books were going to start piling up.The upgrades I wish it had would be a back light, and colour for the front of books. Plus titles would look better if they looked like they were on a shelf with the display being the book cover.But I use it every single day. Lots of free books out there on amazon.com to get sent to your kindle. You can also get free samples of books with approx half a chapter.I suggest you guys get a cover for it, to protect it from damages from sitting on counters or drips of coffee while you are reading."
3,wireless network problems,"I have a Kindle 1 and really like it except for the problems I have connecting to the network. I live in Lexington, Ky. and am unable to connect to the network about half the time I try to sync my Kindle or shop in the Kindle store."
3,notes function,does anybody know how long the notes can be? is there a limit on how many characters you can put into each note? thanks.
2,Beware of Sneaky Problem,I am what is called an early adopter. Because of this I was given a Kindle by my children for Christmas. I liked it so much that I bought one for my wife just a couple of months later.It kind of upset me that version one and version two were so close together. But then I suppose you want their best efforts at the time of purchase.We are currently in England and I just made a horrible discovery. It seems that you can charge the Kindle two from your computer just like they say. What they don't tell you is that the cable they send is special and will only work with the Kindle. I have several different camera cords and nothing fits. Guess where the special Kindle Cable is?? Back in the U. S. attached to the charger.Thenks genius engineers. I hope that you sell at least a half cozen extra chargers and cords.
4,Kindle Review,I am very satisfied with my purchase. The device pretty much does everything I expected. I especially like the bookmark feature and the battery life (3 to 4 days before I need to charge) as well as the ability to use it in direct sunlight. No more buying books and dealing with bookcases and/or what to do with the books once you have read them.I do wish it had a backlight feature as the device requires light in order to read.I am also a bit disappointed with the newly published selections as I thought there would be a greater variety and selection.I also purchased the Amazon cover at $29.99 which is a bit over priced but does the job.BTW...no sales tax and FREE SHIPPING via FEDEX SMARTPOST in 4 days...GREAT SERVICE!
3,The good & bad,"I purchased the Kindle as the area I live in part of the year has no book store & I don't want to pack in a 6 month supply. You know, those famous airline extra baggage & overweight charges! It lives up to what I expected, is easy to use and the screen is clear and easy on the eyes in varying light conditions.My beef is that so many titles are restricted from sale in Canada due to copyright restrictions. Not Kindle's fault but frustrating none the less. Secondly, there doesn't seem to be a way to use gift certificate credits when purchasing books as the charge is automatically debited to a credit card with 'one click' shopping.I like the product but if you live in Canada I would seriously reconsider the purchase."
3,ok,"It's ok. It won't update wirelessly where I live, so I have to plug it into the computer and drag the books over myself. I'm kind of disappointed with the ""global"" 3g."
1,Outstanding device,Wonderful reading device. Easy to use and easy to download books. My daughter loves to read and loves using her Kindle.
3,navigation,"One thing I like about a print book is the ability to navigate, flip back and forth to locate information, review something I read early on in the book. I usually remember approximately where in the book I want to find and even which side of the page it was on. This is not possible on Kindle. In the last book I read I wanted to return to a family tree (which by the way could not be size adjusted and was tiny, tiny) but after countless attempts finally gave up ever finding it.Otherwise, a neat way to read........"
5,Great reading experience,"As a person with terrible eyesight and enormously thick glasses...the Kindle 2 has dramatically improved my reading experience. I can adjust the font based upon my eye's desire, it lightness and portability makes it easy to read whether sitting, laying, toileting, etc., and the the clarity of the letters is truly wonderful. Thank you, Amazon!"
3,Nice reader but many book titles not available,I have had the Kindle since March 2009. I love it and agree with many of the other reviews. My biggest disappointment is that many of the book titles that I want to read are not available. The Kindle is fine if all you like to read are the newest best sellers - and even many of them are not available - but if you like to read obscure or not the most popular titles then the it can be frustrating to own a Kindle.
4,Better than original Kindle,"My original Kindle's display went out and so I bought the Kindle 2. I'm not sure of the exact dimensions, but it looks and feels much smaller and lighter. The keyboard is also much easier to use and the menu-ing system is easier to get around as well. Overall, a much better product at a great new price."
4,Kindle,"We have thouroughly enjoyed the Kindle. We took it on a recent trip and instead of dragging along several books, we just took the one Kindle. Of course, we had to stagger our reading times. The one thing I don't care for is the fact that you are in essence borrowing the book, you are renting the book, so to speak. But on the positive side, how many times do you really read a book over again. The fonts can be changed to a larger or smaller size for easy reading and if you get a cover, the sensation of holding a book is similar. Another good thing is when you finish a book, no more waiting until you can get to a book store or wait for it to come in the mail--it downloads in a very short amount of time. Then you are good to go We like the Kindle very much and recommend it to anyone who loves to read"
5,Very nice product,"Die Kindle is a absolute great product. Shopping books is very consumer friendly and the ""Manage your Kindle"" page is a realy nice thing. The new Kindle is very well build and its responds faster to user action them some other products around.Killer Features are:+ Text-To-Speach+ Dictionaries like pocket oxford english-german translation.+ The 3G connection.I would like to see more german books and a little lower price for the books ;-). And well, i would buy a DX right now if i could. Dont know why Amazon did make a that strange decision with the DX Wireless technologie."
4,Good but could be better!!,"Overall very pleased with my purchase. I have waited patiently for a version that will work in the UK and have not been disappointed with the whole Kindle experience. I have looked at buying a Sony ebook reader before but their poor Mac compatibility stopped me buying one. The Kindle resolves the Mac/Pc issue by downloading content via 3G and doing away with the need for a computer to manage/download your books. Connecting with the Kindle book store is reasonably quick, downloading works well and is quite fast and the choice of books for UK consumers is reasonably extensive, although there are still too many books restricted to specific regions i.e. USA and not available in the UK.What could be improved - a UK plug would be useful, greater book choice and less regional restrictions, price of books in general is towards the high end."
4,A superb experience!!!,"I really am excited as a new citizen of the Kindle nation. I just love my Kindle 2, which I just purchased a month ago. I am still in the learning process but i am enjoying every minute of it. I wonder if there will ever be a Kindle 3. I guess I am getting ahead of myself.By the way, thank you very much Amazon!Roberto A."
4,Kindle II,"Convenient little gadget, bought it for wife for birthday.. Had to try it out myself read the first book on it.. Very fast reading, and love how it keeps your place with no bookmarks. Well worth the money with easy downloads no matter where you are at. One drawback it is difficult to hold as it is only half the size of a book. Buy cover with device, makes it easier to handle.."
3,"Traded up to the DX before receiving the 6""","I love the concept of an e-reader device and after researching for over a month decided on the Kindle. I order the 6"" version which got delayed because Amazon ran out of stock. In the course of waiting I read the reviews on the DX and became convinced that tha DX was the one for me. So I stopped the 6"" order and ordered the DX which I love and am very happy with. What I like best about the DX: 1- larger screen, 2- PDF capability 3-Overall size of the unit 4- the ability to read sideways when needed.I initially struggled with the price difference however I am very satisfied with my decision to switch units"
4,love,I love my kindle and would never go without it. BUT I have recently been checking out Barnes and Nobles E Reader and it will let you borrow books for 14 days from a friend!!! That is a BIG deal for me because I have missed trading books with my friends and family. I hope Amazon gets on the boat with that request!!
3,Highlighter!,"Amazon! A stylus should be added to this product that allows the reader to highlight and/or make notes (as with an advanced java script, perhaps)."
1,Still Not working,I have owned this device for 2 weeks now and still haven't gotten it to work so I can even register it. It keeps telling me there is no signal and to try later. The instruction book that comes with it is of very little use and has no troubleshooting tips AT ALL.
3,Kindle,"I really like the ease and use of the Kindle, but what I DO NOT LIKE is the fact that I have to periodically ""reboot"" the device because I receive error messages. I have had the Kindle for less than 30 days and have had to ""reboot"" a minimum of 10X. Not sure if this is a problem with just MY Kindle or if this problem is pervasive with all Kindles. I hope to gain some feedback and improve the situation after following up with Amazon tech support- again."
4,good but,"I'm very happy with the Kindle 2 in general. I am using it to read books, some magazines. I have also been adding reference documents for work and this is where the 4, rather than 5, star rating comes in. I really want the native PDF capability found on the DX. Other than that, I am completely satisfied."
5,Great!,I was positively surprised with my Kindle! Very smooth and easy to use and the whispernet downloads work very well!
3,"Love it when it works, but has a limited life","I was addicted to my Kindle, it was great to have a library of books to choose from and change the text size of the print to a size that I can read. Having millions of books to choose from and library books available to borrow, my Kindle was the best. However, my 1st Kindle lasted 1 month shy of a year, Amazon replaced it with no problem. The replacement Kindle lasted just over a year, the warranty on replacements only continue from the original warranty, so it's 90 days. Service advised me on a price of another Kindle. I was reading a story and the screen just went black. The 1st Kindle I had had lines through the screen. Reset didn't work, recharge didn't work. I would think that Kindles should last longer than a year."
5,Sheila's Kindle,"I love my Kindle. My husband says he thinks it is glued to me because I am generally reading from it when he falls asleep at night and he wakes to find that I have started reading it again.I am a person with a disability which affects my wrists, so my Kindle has been a blessing. Before it came into my life I was unable to pick up and read any book which was more than about 1 inch thick. Now I can download a book containing any number of pages and am able to hold my Kindle without any pain in my wrists. It's a medical miracle!Sheila"
5,Its good but I'm still learning how to get the most out of it,I love it . . . and I think I will love it even more as I use it and learn how to utilize it to the maximum in the search mode. I have purchased several works and the downloads took about 2 minutes apiece - much cheaper than buying the hard cover. I have linked my laptop in and that makes the Kindle all the better. I would recommend a kindle to anyone with the reservation that it does take a little getting used to . . . I am 59 and fairly adaptable but it is a change in the manner of doing things that you have to get used to to enjoy.
5,Wife is happy...,I purchased this for my wife as a Mother's Day present. She really likes it and is satisfied with the features available to her.A good product.No problems.
4,The most updated way to read...,"If you read on planes, this is definetly the way to go. How many times have you carried 2+ paperbacks on the plane because you are ""almost"" done with one and want to have the ""next"" one ready in case you finish halfway thru your 4.5 hour flight? Been there, done that, which was the reason for this purchase. With airline flights getting more crowded, it's much easier to take out the Bose earphones, Ipod and Kindle 2, set it in the seat and then not have to get up the entire flight! No more digging around in the computer bag to the get the ""almost"" finished book! Give yourself time to get to know the Kindle 2, however, before traveling with it..."
2,Not for computer savvy,"Being locked in to Amazon and only Amazon controlling what you can read, how it appears on the page, and how much you pay for it is really frustrating. I read books on my computer and cell phone, which aren't as nice to look at, but I can read anything I want--including library books.As a casual reader I tend to get books online, from the library, friends, used book stores, garage sales, etc. I cannot justify spending $250 for this gadget plus the $80 every time it needs a battery.I'm computer savvy enough to overcome the backup issues that Amazon has However, it is frustrating that this machine could do so much more but Amazon chose not to allow it.On the plus side, if you're a voracious reader and spend lots of money in bookstores, this could be for you. The display is very nice, easy to read, and light enough to carry."
3,Kindle review,the thing I don't like is that you have to buy books from the kindle store lots of authors missing
1,Broken screen with less than 1 hour of use!,"Wow. My husband bought me a kindle for Christmas. I opened it yesterday and spent about 30 minutes ""oohing and aahing"" over it. Even downloaded a new book. Then placed it on a table and left it to charge. Went back 30 minutes later to read my new ebook, and the screen is SHOT! The contrast is all messed up, there is a shadow of the previous page when you navigate to a new page, and in some cases the screen is black and the text is white. There is a white streak running down part of the page. Called support and ""Herbert"" - I am sure that's not his real name - is very pleasant and kind and offers to replace the new unit with another one and is sending it UPS priority. Despite his professionalism, I am very disappointed with the product already and am afraid after reading all the other reviews that this is just the first in what is going to be a long line of frustrations with my new Kindle. Will continue to update this review, but for now it's a 1-star!"
2,"Low vision, beware","I was very excited about this product when I first heard about it, but this didn't last long. I am a person with low vision (20/400) so I may be something of a special case. I used to be a BIG reader and the prospect of being able to read comfortably again was thrilling. Currently, the best format for me is to read HTML text online using the firefox browser which has nearly unlimited font enlargement (unlike MS IE). I reflow the text so it stays onscreen and I don't have to scroll back and forth on every line. I do this using a little software plug-in called platypus. Nothing like this is possible on the Kindle.The Kindle's 6 font sizes are woefully inadequate. Likewise the display technology shows great but but looks awful. Black letters on a gray background reduce readability even further. Combine these problems with the other short comings mentioned in other reviews and you have a poorly designed, poorly built, great idea."
1,Big Brother Control,"I was thinking of buying a Kindle, but not now. Amazon controls way too much of the product. If I buy something, I own it and I control it. However, Amazon proved that they can and will control what I buy, what I read, and all other data that comes with owning this product. They can delete, change, otherwise control the product without touching it. NO, Big Brother is not worth the money!!!"
3,Yet another thing to charge and carry...,"It would be awesome if it could do more.... Facebook, basic web surfing (that was more functional than currently), wireless streaming of spoken text, backlit screen, etc. Nice effort, but it always gets left at home because it doesn;t quite do... enough."
4,The Kindle,"I recently received the Kindle and so far I find it extremely enjoyable! The pages turn easily, the downloading is very easy and the font sizes are great to choose from. I only wonder at times why certain books have so many missing words in a sentence. The sentence usually makes sense, not always, but mostly. I am not very happy with how the page count is applied. I have no idea what the numbers mean at the bottom of the page. I go by the percentage of what I have read. I would prefer to just have numbers at the bottom of the page as regular books do. 1, 2, 3, 4......Clearly understood."
4,Re-kindled my love of reading,"I love my kindle. I now always have a book to read. I use to read more when I was younger but it wasn't until I got the kindle that I realized how much more I could be reading. It is thin and light and I can always have it with me to read at lunch at work, or waiting in a doctor's office. I am a visual learner but I do not miss having to haul around physical books. I love it."
5,Kindle Cool,"I've only had my Kindle for 3 months, but find it one of the better purchases that I have made over the years..... I read 1 to 2 books a week and although I still have a few hard copies lying around waiting to be read... the convenience and cost effectiveness of the Kindle has won me over. I highly recommend purchasing a Kindle if you are an avid book reader such as myself."
5,absolutely the best!,"i just love my kindle. lots of things you can do with it and so easy to handle. there will always be books that one would rather have in your hands, but this ""tool"" is just great for travelling etc. you can even read well in the sun, no glare what so ever."
5,Kindle is great!!!!,"Kindle is great. Handles comfortably, and is very soft on the eyes when reading. With the latest software update that handles any pdf, I am very happy with the functionality. Large font type is very nice for people with visual problems. I would like to see more books at $10, though."
3,Kindle - for Australians,"Great product. However in Australia there are problems with the availability of contemporary titles which is frustrating. Hopefully there will be agreements made so that we can take full advantage of such a wonderful invention. Reading from a Kindle is fantastic, i took to it without any difficulty. Occasionally I find myself trying to turn the page. The accessories are also fantastic I purchased a M Edge cover and light which works really well."
5,Books always available,"I had read Lots and Lots of the reviews before buying this item - pro and con. I just love it! By the time I finished my first novel I was adjusted to not ""holding a book on the printed page"". That is an adjustment. I love the dictionary that will define an unusual word that I come to. I'm guessing that the new versions will have color in the future. I was in the hospital and a rehab. facility and it was really easy to put aside, find my place, etc."
4,Everything I expected ... if only it were cheaper,"Everything you've heard about the Kindle is true: books and newspapers are easy to download and read; the text is clear; it's lightweight; it's easier to take on vacation than two books and a stack of magazines (though I still buy glossy mags for the pictures).The only thing that keeps me from wholeheartedly recommending it to my friends is the cost. With a cover and shipping, it comes to $400, which is a lot for most people, even avid readers. Maybe the economy will ratchet back up, or maybe economies of scale will bring the price of the Kindle down, and then I can insist that everyone I know buys one."
4,Kindle question/Issues,First and foremost this is not a criticism of Kindle's advantages or disadvantages. It is mainly a question that I would liked answered. I read an article in The Washington Post where Amazon getting into your Kindle and deleting some of the books purchased by people with Kindle (and returned the money) because of Copyright issues. I wonder if Amazon has fixed its copyright licencing issues. I do not want to buy a Kindle and then find out that they have had to recall the book because of Copyright issues. [...]
5,a different kind of book,I like my kindle. It's heavier than a paperback but less than most large hardcover books.I'm still getting used to not turning the pages by hand but I'm sure it will become second nature.
4,Love it but Content needs to Improve,"I Love it- just the right size and very easy to use. I enjoy reading on it and love the 3G and wireless connectivity. I am alarmed that many E-Books actually cost more than their paper counterparts. In order for the E-Books to succeed, prices need to come down on most content. I also feel the cover art of the book should be represented with every purchase in gray-scale."
4,Great for city life,"Recently purchased my second Kindle which is now the Globalversion. I live in a rural area where my internet connection is only via DSL so I connect to the Whispernet thru my wireless router in my house with no problems with my original Kindle. However, the new Kindle will not connect! So, to order books I have to download onto my computer and then transfer to the Kindle. So, the new improved version doesn't work as well as the original version for me! Once books are loaded the Kindle is great!"
4,Loving my Kindle,Just a quick note of thanks for an excellent transaction. I love my Kindle!I will continue looking closely at your offerings and I am sure to purchase in the future.
4,Defective cable,The cable for charging The Kindle has developed approx. 16 cracks in the plastic coating and exposing the wire underneath. The cable isn't used very often as the charge seems to last a long time. Kindle won't replace the cord even though the cabling is an obvious defective material problem. My cord has more black electrical tape on it than the white coating the cord came with.
1,Broken Kindle,"My name is Alyce Buckley and about 18 months ago, I bought my daughter, Shawn Clark a Kindle at Amazon. A few weeks ago, she tried to use it and one corner on the upper right hand side is blocked out, therefore making reading impossible.Both she and myself spend a ton of money at Amazon with books, toys, and all of our gift shopping. I would imagine you only have a years warrantee on this item, but would hope an exception could be made to keep some good customers. A Kindle should last more than 18 months. Obviously, we cannot buy books with a non working Kindle.Please advise... I am writing this from her account - David & Shawn Clark - clarkx4@gmail.com My email address is bucko3200@aol.com.Thank you for your concern in this matter.Alyce Buckley"
5,Kindle Fan,"I love my Kindle. It is very very convenient when traveling. The books are reasonably priced and it couldn't be easier to purchase them. Being older and not quite as electronic savvy as younger people I found the instructions a little lacking. With time and a little trial and error, I am figuring out how to navigate through various things. Wish it had some kind of built in reading light but overall love it. I would recommend the Kindle to anyone who loves to read."
1,Inflexible device,"My friend purchased this only to find that the only books it works with are from Amazon. Why would you pay this much to buy a implement that only does books from 1 source?No end of frustration setting it up and trying to figure out if you can use with the the local public library (you can't).Do not buy this device, get something that has some market flexibility."
5,"LOVE IT, LOVEIT, LOVE IT","This is the best thing i have ever ordered. Ever since I got this I have not put it down. I actually had books placed on my kindle before I even got it, and the only thing I can say is WOW!"
4,KINDLE WIRELESS,"item arrived as described - quickly and in perfect condition.great product. only complaint is the price of books to download, thought they might be cheaper.otherwise would recommend."
5,Excelent,"I find the Kindle wireless reader versatile, easy to transport around and easy to read from the screen. I have shown it to several persons while attending my son's sporting events. It is an excellent product for avid readers. You may think of offering textbooks for downloading purposes for high school and college students."
4,Kindle Reader,"Once I learned the how's of using my Kindle, it was easy to choose a book and read it. I especially like the sample option. It gives me a chance to see if I've read this book before or it's the type of story that's going to grab my interest.I feel, however, it should be easier to get a review or synopsis before I need to get a sample. For example when I click on the book picture it should link me up with a blurb about the book such as you see on the dust jacket of a actual book.I bought the Kindle mainly for travel. I haven't had the opportunity, but I'm looking forward to it."
4,No connection via 3G!!!,"I live in Alcala de Henares, Madrid, Spain and, although your map indicates almost total coverage for Spain, cannot get the 3G connection. So for the time being, at least, I have to do everything by computer download. Can anyone explain why and fix this problem, please.The rest of the features are great."
5,The Best Way To Read Books!,"I have never been a big book reader but then I bought the Kindle 2 after reading a manuscript with ease on the computer. I haven't been able to put it down since I got it. I read a book in 2 days...I haven't read a whole book since I was forced to in school! If you are a big book reader...and even if you are not, this is the best product out there! Sooooo worth every penny spent! Don't wait to get yours!"
4,"Finally, I got my wife her own...","This is quite convenient. Books are easy to obtain and read, even if you are without your reading glasses. A backlight would be usefull and...well, the competition will keep this gem evolving. I've already paid for it in savings. It's a no brainer, even for the casual reader."
2,I changed my mind about purchasing a Kindle,"I was all set to purchase the Kindle 2. Then I decided to really read the reviews. The reviews gave me much to ponder about purchasing a Kindle. I like the idea of reading all the books & not having to build a library onto my house to store the books. Then I read, I cannot keep the books I have on my Kindle for very many years. I was attracted to the ""read or listen"" feature that would spare my old eyes. Then I read where most authors or publishers do not allow this ( just because they won't make money selling CDs of their books). I have changed my mind & will not be purchasing a Kindle now."
4,Great devise but poor selection of titles to download,"Kindle is just great, but the selection of books to download is poor, at least for Europe. Virtually none of the titles I was looking for is available, even among great contemporary novelists such as Coetzee, Hustvedt, Rushdie, Dische, etc. etc. I hope that this is going to change soon."
3,to less books from known writers - newspapers without index,"Technically a great deal. But: I thought it would be a good way to learn english reading well known books in my mother language in english. But i am disapointed that i cannot find writers like Philip Roth, only some books of John Irving or in germany well known Haruki Murakami. German Guenter Grass isn't among the available authors.I would like to buy international newspapers only if content is important for me. But there is no actual index that could help me in my decision to buy a sample that day.Missing localisation. Slowly but meanwhile with more speed ebooks become spread in germany. In europe more than 90 million people could read german. Why is amazon so reluctant to go in this market? The window seems open now, but as all know, close unexepected because of new concurrenst like german textr."
5,Wishes,"I would like to have a lighted screen so I can read in the dark without disturbing my husband, especially when I want to read in bed. I wouldn't feel like i was keeping him awake. Otherwise, I love my K2"
4,Great for books that are just text but it won't replace my library.,"Let me start by saying I do enjoy my Kindle 2. Kindle 2 is great for reading books with lots of text such as the ""Lords of Finance"" or the ""The World is Flat"". But if you have books with tables and graphics the Kindle 2 is not such a great reading experience. I read a lot of math, technology, and finance books and it's my opinion that Kindle ink technology today does not do a good job with graphics, formulas, and tables.Also I struggle with the green factor. Through Amazon you can get great deals on hardcover used books. Unless traveling I prefer the experience of a hardcover book."
3,Improvement on international access is required,"Kindle works out exactly what an e-book reader I'm expecting. Features such as flawless push-based ebook delivery and highly readable screen is excellent. However, there is only a handful of magazine selection available on international contents. I'm bored by magazine contents which is delivered without graphics."
3,Lab Experiments for AP Chemistry,"Apparently the teacher and student manuals share the same ISBN, which makes no sense to me. There was no picture available, so I ordered the item thinking I was getting the teacher version and it isn't. Not much help, as I am the teacher."
5,awesome book!!!,I absoultey loved this book!!! I read it in one weekend. Lurlene McDaniel is an awesome writer. She has captured every emotion of mine. This book also taught me a lot about how the amish tend to live there lives. I hope that you really enjoy this book and all the others that Lurlene McDaniel has writtne.
2,My opinion!,"okey, i read this book when i was like aout ten.The angels trilogy is so sad.first of all leah falls in love with some amish guy in like 5 seconds, that would never happen in real life.Plus they had nothing in common.Then in the second book Rebekah dies.Then at the end of the third one it left you on a cliff.did they brake up or what?That book was simple.more for like a third grader.It also left me depressed for a whole week.I dont recomd this book if you like romance novels, only if you like meaningless words.kk bye!hope this helped comment back@!"
3,no match for clerk one,"I believe success of clerk one spoiled smith to make this over-exeggeratedversion of such a great movie. Ths acting was not nearly as natural as clerk one and one would easily feel the phoney and over-zealous dialogues.I found the scene with the donky so badly matched to the movie to the point of being stupid.i watched clerk one several time but I only could watch this one once and even eager to see the ending asap.success of smithwent completely to his head over this movie.I wish he would stick to morenatural scripts and much more believeable chsrators , leaving all animals out. he is much better with hanlding real people."
3,"Ok, I can handle this.","So I did not have high hopes for this movie. After watching Dogma, a friend suggested Clerks, and I was like...""I don't know, its a nice day out...etc. etc."" But we decided to check it out. (No pun intended) I was not a huge fan of Silent Bob and Dave, but the movie had some good parts...rockin out in the shop, lettin loose, jammin with friends...all stuff I can get behind. The story wasn't bad either. I gave it 3 stars, and will probably end up ""checking out"" ; ) the sequel!"
4,decent sequel,"taken as a movie in and of itself it is funnier than most stuff i see in the theaters nowadays. that's probably a good summary for how i felt about this movie.that said... i think this overcapitalizes on the elements that made clerks such a success. same basic plot, same basic dialogue, same characters. there wasn't enough about this movie that made it stand on its own. as expected, plenty of cameos from the usual cast of characters to give the old fans reasons to cheer (much akin to chewbacca making a completely meaningless appearance in the star wars prequel). the thing i wish smith kept that he didn't was starting each section with a title (i.e. jay and silent bob- new & improved).here's my list of his movies i've seen from best to worst in my opinion:chasing amyclerksmallratsclerks iidogmajay & silent bob strike backafter all is said and done though the writing is still pretty funny. four stars."
5,Kevin Smith's Masterpiece,"In what writer, director Kevin Smith calls his favorite movie so far, Donte and Randal return to insult customers and slack off as much as possible. Filled with references and stars from his previous movies, Clerks 2 stands on it own for even those new to the Askewniverse."
2,"What happened, Kevin?","Clerks II is a failure. The film seems like Clerks mixed with The Notebook. Kevin Smith has lost something in his film-making talent. It seems the more successful he becomes, the worse his movies become.Most of Clerks II is centered around Dante preparing to move to Florida with his new fiancee. So we have to sit through 90 minutes of his strangely effeminate relationship with his boss, Becky, and his clearly homosexual feelings towards Randall. At some points Smith tires to recreate the nostalgia of the original Clerks with long winded, but brilliant, conversations about nerd stuff like Star Wars and Lord of the Rings, but it fails. Smith even brings in a long line of cameos to try to spruce up the movie...but that again fails. The bottom line is that this movie is mostly boring. Actually its a train wreck. Only Jay and Silent Bob keep the movie entertaining with the help of a few Clerks 1 type moments by Randall. I miss the Kevin Smith I loved in 1994...."
2,Why? Why? Why?,"Not sure why this movie needed to be made. A few laughs here and there, but overall corny and uninspired."
5,A must have...,If you are even close to a Kevin Smith fan....hello....this is no brainer! The special features make it worth even more...
1,LAME,"This movie was a disaster. There wasn't a laughable moment. It was just a series of disjointed scenes that aren't funny on their own, let alone put together into a whole movie. And why start a love story 50 minutes into it? No one cares. Either stick to the no-plot theme or give the plot respect. Don't hurry it along in the last half hour because you've spent the bulk of your time on female anatomy, animal abuse, and gay jokes. The whole movie just made me depressed thinking how Kevin Smith is probably alot like his characters - getting older but staying exactly the same."
1,Bob is right,"WTG Bob! I agree completely. This has to be the most boring, stupid movie that I've seen this year. I want my 90 minutes back. The funniest bit was the LOTR scene...besides this the movie must be watched while stoned or drunk.It isn't all that. The first movie was hilarious, too."
1,"Hurray, its OVER!!!!!!!!","No more milking the popularity of Clerks, an overrated movie to begin with.No more pretending Smith is a genius.No more snarky, over-written dialog.No more pedestrian cinematography.No more Smith trying to pass his wife off as hot.No more sentimental scenes back-to-back with donkey scenes.Good-bye, Kevin! G'BYYYEEEeeeee!!!!"
5,Better than the original,"This is quite possibly one of the funniest movies you'll see all year. It's about two losers who work in a fast food restraunt and all of the wild and crazy antics that follow. It all depends if this kind of humor is up your alley. What more could you ask for. It's funny, vulgar, well written, well acted and just a wonderful film in every way possible. My only advice is to stay away if your easily offended. That R-rating is there for a real reason."
5,Clerks II even funnier!,"Clerks II Is even Funnier than Clerks 1, it's way better and Rosario Dawson is beautiful, there is a horrible yet disturbingly funny scene with a mule haha. gross. the movie is not a masterpiece but is one of Kevin's best."
3,Bit of a let down,"The first Clerks movie was an indie classic. In the second one they basically butchered the characters and plot lines. There are a few good laughs and is pretty entertaning, but in comparison to the first movie, this one is not a good."
3,"Long and talky, but with some hilarious moments","I liked II better than the original. Definitely worth seeing. Very talkative at times and the humor is hit and miss. Enough funny moments to make it worth watching, and it features a rather nice, heartwarming ending.The HD DVD looks terrific, and the 2 disc set (!) features terrific extras."
5,Too Funny,"Ok...so I knew going in that there would be a lot of raunchy jokes and suggestiveness...And I was not dissapointed!!I enjoyed the Original Clerks...But there was someting about Clerks II that just seemed to stand out. I loved all the horrible jokes, the hilariously random dance sequence, and Silent Bob finally at a loss for words!!!This film was awesome!! If you LOVE Jay and Silent Bob....You will love this one."
5,batcall,Clerks was made great with a small budget. This is a follow-up with a better budget because of commedic genious.
2,Reasonably humorous but a disappointment...,"...compared to the first movie...the first one funny and it felt much more spontaneous and improvised...this one is tedious, overacted and overdirected...and what happened to Jason Mewes -- did he just get out of rehab or something?...he looked like death warmed over with a delivery to match...and if someone makes a cameo shouldn't it be something more than wagging their face in front of the camera and walking off?...Affleck shows up and does nothing...can't recommend spending money on this one."
2,Pretty Much Pure Garbage,"Hey, I like most of Smith's movies, but this was simply pathetic. First off, how many times does the word F**k have to be used in each sentence of a movie? Minor complaint though. It's just that the ideas are stale and the dialogue does not have the wit and bite of the original or Mallrats or even Chasing Amy (overrated too). It's all just too contrived and forced, and the soundtrack is immensely boring. Only saving grace in this is Jay's role and a Smashing Pumpkins song in the soundtrack. The fact that this has an average of a 4 star review is an incredibly telling indicator of the mentality of the morons and losers that lap up this drivel. The gutter is too classy a place for this one to lay."
2,Wowzah! This movie was REALLY REALLY.....uh.....meh.,"Had high hopes for this flick, really did. liked clerks. thought mallrats was boss. and chasing amy was better than good (minus the Affleck overacting). DIDN'T care for this one. can't remember laughing out loud not one time. maybe the movie was too colorful for me. maybe the star wars references were overly-nerdy and uninteresting. maybe Rosario Dawson looks a monkey-ish to me. well not maybe, but she does. simply put, it was just not funny. even STRIKES BACK, which i probably would've gave 3.3 stars was vastly funnier pound-for-pound. Dante's character was overly-done in my opinion. Too spineless and too bitchy. I wouldn't buy it."
1,Tired of his schtick,Sigh. He showed such promise with his first film. Why does he keep doing the same thing ad nauseum?
5,Buy this movie,"I am a big fan of Clerks. Clerks 2 is just as good, but a bit different. Some great added characters especially the Elias charactor. Like the first it has funny moments its hard to find a favorite part. Off the top of my head the Stars Wars vs Lord of the Rings was funny. I liked the ending too. Go check this movie out. Very good - especially if you enjoyed Clerks"
3,The World According to Kevin Smith,Doesn't hold a finger to Clerks but moretheless hits the mark I could have done without the potty humor and the anti-religous overtones in the movie and the ending wasn't too hot but it was still a good movie.
2,doesn't compare to the original,"had some funny parts, but the movie was kinda stupid and gimmicky. it's kinda like a Harold & Kumar type movie, it's decently funny, somewhat entertaining, but lacks substance. they should have quit after the original Clerks. that was a great movie. and if you've seen the original directors cut of the first one, you'd know that they couldn't have possibly made this sequel"
2,A poor follow up to a brilinat movie.,"Ok, so when I first watched this movie I wrote a very angry review about it which could not be posted due mostly to poor choice of language in it. I loved the first Clerks movie and was excited to watch this on, but the entire movie was immensity disappointing. They completely changed and ruined all of the characters from the first ie Randall and Donnie. Randall is no longer the care free youth who understands the significance of his station and life and acts accordingly now. They turned him into no more than a jerk and a bully. Rather than being crude in a funny way, he is simply nasty now. And Donnie, he became a low life in this one. Their first was great, but this is exactly what it seams like an attempt of two middle aged men to reclaim their past fame. If you liked the first one at all, you will not like this one save for Jay and Silent Bob's bits. They are the only reason this sequel did not receive a 1 star review."
1,yet another tooth extraction,"It isn't funny.It isn't well directed.Its edited horribly.The 'actors' mug at the camera, trying to pass for cool.This qualifies it though as a indy hit.Kevin Smith has never been more than what hollywood thinks a young turk outsider director should be.Now with his career in the toilet(die hard cameos and clerks 2 are him sliding under the waves)I find myself looking with anticipation for his next abortion as his movies are bordering on so bad its good territory."
1,WHY OH WHY,"why aren't there any people who have brains reviewing this? this movie completely sucked ballz. with each gag going nowhere, and a plot like swiss cheese, this could hardly be called entertaining. what a waste of time and money. don't waste yours, it treally isn't worth it."
1,Dull movie plain and simple,"Was this supposed to be a comedy? Man, people who put 4/5 stars must have been drunk watching this garbage.Slow paced, same uninteresting characters, and most of all...NOT funny."
1,I had to finish it...,"My roommate and I rented this to see what all the hype was about.After 10 minutes we looked at each other because of how horrible the movie was. We continued to comment on how bad the movie was throughout, but we kept watching it in hope that it would get better. It has it's scenes that I laughed at, pretty much every comedy will have them, but It was completely over acted by some of the worst actors in Hollywood. The worst part is they set up for a third one... again with horrible acting."
5,Best Yet!,I think this is the best Kevin Smith movie to date. Great writing with an awesome cast. Excellent!
2,Canvas is NOT the way to go,"This bag gets two stars because it has very sturdy French seams and the bias-cut canvas can withstand all manner of treatment, but that's all this bag has going for it. I've used it for piping frostings and icings several times now, and everything leaks through the bag onto my hands, precluding a good grip and getting sugary grease on everything I touch (makes for an epic mess to clean up). Contrary to another review on this product, canvas is NOT the way to go-it is a loosely woven fabric, so the filling leaks between the threads. Also, the bottom of the bag is just a wee bit too big to fit my standard couplers, so frosting leaks out between the bottom of the bag and the top of the piping tip. Another problem is the finished bottom seam, making the fabric there very thick. Even if it did fit standard couplers, the seam is too thick to properly screw on a coupler ring. Do yourself a favor and head straight for the plastic-coated pastry bags; don't buy this one!"
3,Leaves black marks on book pages,"Although this bookweight does the job and I was initially pleased with it, I soon found that the edge of the leather is stained black and the stain leaves the book pages with black marks that can't be removed. Merely picking the bookweight up and moving it to a new page causes marks and if you slide the bookweight down the page, you will have a lot of marks. I am contacting the company to see if they make a version with no stain.Feb. 2008 - As an update to this review, three emails to the company went unanswered as did a phone call, thus negating the chance that I will order anything else from them."
4,"Works well, but be careful...","This bookmark is heavy and long, making it perfect to hold down pages so that you can read a book hands-free. This is very useful when taking notes from a book when the book doesn't want to stay open by itself. However, there is black dye or paint on the edge of the bookmark and it rubs off leaving small marks on pages when you pick it up or put it down or slide it back and forth. To avoid this, I turn the bookmark upside-down so the black edge doesn't touch. It's not a big deal to me, and I believe the bookmark is worth purchasing despite this drawback, but it would be nice if they offered this bookmark without the black edge."
4,Works great!,"I read the reviews regarding the black marking. I actually tried it when I got it and I had to be really intentional for it to mark a page. When it did mark, it was really faint. I got three of them, one for my office, one for my home, and one for my bag. I use quote from books all the time for my work and these weights are perfect for my use. I also like to cook alot, and this is helpful for those pesty cook books that like to close on me all the time.On really stiff books I have found that the weight could be heavier, but all I have to do is adjust it to keep the book open. So it works with everything. Its a great purchase."
5,Great bookmark!,"I purchased two of these for my mother, and she uses them all the time! They work great on hardcovers and paperbacks. She has not experienced any of the black/gray markings on the book pages from these. These make a great gift for any book lover."
5,Weighted Book Mark,"Gave it as a gift, and it was well received. I already have one, use it constantly."
4,Neil's Solo Album (well it sounds like it),"SOUND: _Release_ is a departure from the PSB sound of years ago. It reminds me of the pace of _Behavior_ without the gems of It's a Sin, HCYETBTS, and Jealousy. Also, it sounds like Chris was absent for many of the songs, since his vibrant programming sounds are missing or diluted. Instead Neil stole that vocoder thing from Cher and used that on one song. (though Neil's nasal sound could double as a vocoder). However with all its faults from traditional PSB sound (whatever that is), the album is surprisingly good. I only hope the singles are remixed up a notch. Sadly Home & Dry is not...SONG PICKS: (1) Home & Dry defines the album. (4)London and (8)Here are the peppiest."
1,Lost the screw twice,"Twice when using this rake I lost the little screw holding the Rake together. Fiskars sent me a replacement screw the first time, but now it is out of warranty and I need to find my own solution to the special type of screw they used. What a pain in the neck."
3,Fiskar rake,I thought that it would be very different from regular rakes. I con't think it is. It works well but not as well as I expected. Maybe my expectations were too high.
1,Terrible Rake,"This claimed to have a ""nearly-unbreakable rake head"". It broke during shipment. I returned without any problems, but did not request a replacement."
2,Not for pinestraw,"I bought this rake according to the reviews on Amazon.The rake is light which I like but the only complaintI have is that it is not made for pinestraw. Within a fewrakes it clogged, I spent more time unclogging the rake."
3,So- so,"I bought this rake at Lowes a few years ago at considerably higher cost than Amazon offers. I figured I was investing in a quality rake that would last. It is a wide rake that often collects needles and leaves in its tines but it works well in big areas. However about the sixth year of ownership the nail that holds the plastic shell to the metal came loose, and could not be repaired. My wife had to superglue the rake back together but who knows how long this will last?"
1,poor design,"Because of the good reviews, I ordered the Fiskars rake, but after less than 5 minutes of light use the rake head fell off the handle.Turns out it's held on by one small screw that's ""threaded"" into the thin walled aluminum handle. (maybe a couple of threads)I'm surprised I haven't seen more comments about this problem."
4,Rake,"I had previously owned the same rake years ago but it had broken, so I ordered the same one but it came damaged in the mail, I wanted to rake that day so I did not return it but it made it difficult with a bent shaft."
5,Very durable rake,"I am owning one for 7 years, and I am very happy with it. This rake is very well engineered product, unlike typical poly rake you can find anywhere.The handle is triangular section and easy to grip. The plastic tines are very durable yet flexible. I have moved soils with this rake, but the tine rarely wear nor break. And there is no loose connection between handle and rake head.Too bad that Home Depot does not carry this product any more."
5,"Light, well balanced",I have 4 rakes like this. Good size. Light enough that I can use it for hours and my young daughters can use them too.
4,its a rake,"Its a rake and it does its job well. Lightweight, and has a nice wing span. Im not sure how it will hold up to the scraping I am putting it through on my driveway and sidewalk, but it appears well made. Because it is plastic and rather shallow, this is not the rake you will be using to move a gigantic pile of leaves from one place to the other. All in all I am quite happy with it and my yard is now leaf-free and ready for winter!"
5,Great Rake,"I probably shouldn't say ""Pay no attention to the negative 1-star reviews"", but... I bought one of these from Amazon about a year ago, to replace one on which the head had broken, since I wasn't sure how far they would go with the ""Lifetime Warranty"". So now, about a year after buying a new one, I still have the one with the broken head, and rather than let it go to waste, I decided to call Fiskar's Customer Service and see if they'll sell me a new rake head. Well...They're sending me a new head, FREE. So now, I'll have two, so if she wants to, my wife can help with the raking... :)GREAT rake; nice wide head grabs a lot more leaves... I'm very happy with this thing, and with the company."
5,"Excellent rake for the money, and they stand behind their warranty","I bought one of these a couple of years back at one of the big-box stores, wanted to pick up another, but was unable to find them anywhere. So, I ordered 2, gave one to the in-laws, kept the other for myself. Two days after it arrived, I broke it when ""testing it out"" on some oak leaves. My fault entirely. I slipped on some wet leaves and used the rake break my fall. Snapped the head right in half. I went to the Fiskars web site, followed the procedure for submitting a warranty claim, and 7 days later a brand-new rake head arrived in the mail. No hassle, no questions. Cannot complain one bit about a company that will stand behind it's warranty like that! I may even pick up another as a spare, now that Amazon has lowered the price, again, since my original purchase :-)"
2,Broke after a few uses,"This rake works great - a few times. We have a rather large yard, and after 3-4 uses the rake developed a large crack above the tines. We will be looking for a metal one and hope it will be sturdier!"
2,pretty but not durable,I had this watch for about a year and a half and although it kept perfect time and was very attractive I am disappointed. After about eight months a rattle developed in the band which I could not fix then the #2 off the 12 position popped off and was loose inside the face jamming the second hand constantly and making the watch useless. I am going to try to get it fixed but I'm not sure it will be worth the cost.Too bad because it is very nice. The crystal never even got a single scratch on it after almost constant use over 18 months.I was not at all hard on this watch but maybe I just got a bad one.
3,Good Presentation,These two movies are only about 30 minutes long and are presented as a newscast. There is the anchor who gives the main topic and then he goes to on-the-scene reporters that give more detailed information and interview people with different perspectives on the events taking place. I think this movie would be great for youth learned about the civil war and will give them knowledge that other movies may or may not give so easily.
1,Misleading description!,"The other one-star reviewers are correct- the description of this bin is totally misleading. The days of the week on this are totally useless- they are just imprints, not separate compartments. The only way to put the compost in is through the side door. Yes, it's sturdy, but with zero features, the $180 price I paid in December was a rip-off. Not recommended. Amazon let me down."
2,Not what I expected.,This item is not what I expected. It is incredibly difficult to turn and does not match the description
5,Be(atles) Bopp!,"My heart went boom when I crossed the room after putting on this CD. With all the ""power-poppers"" out there, Andy Bopp has raised the bar with this release. Seems to have resurrected the lads from Liverpool (Rubber Soul / Revolver period) with spot on vocals of Lennon and pop-sensibility of McCartney, with a dash of early Harrison-type guitar work for good measure. Yet at the same time, the CD comes across as original and fresh. I have a CD collection of over 2000 - this one has moved into my personal top 10 and will there for some time to come.The follow-up to this CD (Plate Spinner) is good, but doesn't measure up to this. Few CD's do."
4,Panda Bear,"As a teacher I found this book extremely useful, especially since I had a lot of New Entrants this term. The text is very predictable and this builds up confidence and self esteem very quickly."
2,"I should like this one, but...","I oughta like it, I want to like it, but it just left me flat. More to the point, it left my kids flat. The two stars I gave this were for the illustrations -- they are really cool, as you'd expect with Eric Carle. Normally, you can't go wrong with Bill Martin, but I guess everybody has their bad days. The language doesn't flow as well as the other bear books, and that makes it a little awkward for reading aloud. We have Brown Bear, Brown Bear and Polar Bear, Polar Bear, and both are big favorites with the under-3 set around our house. Panda Bear just doesn't make the grade."
4,Very repetitive,"My daughter LOVES this book. We don't have the other what do you see books, so I can't compare it to them. It is a very good book, the only thing I've noticed is that it is repetitive in the answers each animal gives saying ""that's what I see"" at the end of them all. It's probably good for toddlers to have that repetition, but it's wearing me down. Otherwise I think this is a great book with great pictures and a good introduction to ""unusual"" animals."
4,Great Companion to a Classic,"This book is similar to the original Brown Bear book, with illustrations of panda bear, bald eagle, water buffalo, spider monkey, green sea turtle, macaroni penguin, sea lion, red wolf, whooping crane, black panther, and moon-faced dreaming child.The illustrations are beautiful--Carle's signature watercolor-collage style. While Brown Bear's illustrations show each animal against stark white backgrounds, Panda Bear's illustrations feature them against bold backgrounds. (My sensitive younger toddler found the red wolf and the black panther illustrations a little scary, so we skip those pages for now.)Although this book doesn't lend itself to teaching basic colors and animal sounds the way that the original does, it is a good way to teach the concept of endangered species to younger children. Overall, a great companion to a classic!"
3,It's OK,"Not as good as the original brown bear. Doesn't roll off the tongue that well. Also, a lot of the animals look aggressive, with sharp teeth. Brown Bear and Polar Bear are better choices."
2,Reworked Films,"The three John Wayne movies in this DVD set are not newly discovered John Wayne films, but rather are a trio of public domain films which Legend has renamed, edited slightly, and added music and sound effects in addition to color. The actual films included in this set are BLUE STEEL, THE LUCKY TEXAN and SAGEBRUSH TRAIL. These discs have special features which are all nearly identical on each disc in the set. The only differences are thet the Featurette will be different.In all fairness the BW verison of the film have been cleaned up a bit. The color versions are not as good as prior Legends films releases, as an example see any of the Shirley Temple films which have been colorized. I am not a fan of someone altering with someone elses work, especially when it comes to editing and adding music and sound effects. These three films have menacing music playing throughout the films, which very quickly becomes annoying."
2,Like a thief in the night,"Ok Lets cut the crap, this is just another rerelease of older movies that they think colorizing makes it sale again. This is a walmart 5.50 bin item that has the duke which of course is nice it is in no way worth more than 10 bucks colorized or not.Blue steel and mclintock are the 2 most rereleased john wayne fans of all time.here it comes again blue steel. lol i have this one in 5 different sets.the lucky texan againsagebrush trail againthe only reason to buy this set is if u don't already own them or are the kind of collector that must have every think john wayne on dvd.in closing the quality is subpar if you like to see what they can do with older movies check out errol flynns robin hood or the james bond ultimate collections. these are B movies no amount of tricks is gonna change that in interviews duke himself thought these movies weren't the best.beware this is false advertising and amazon themselves should ad in subtext under the names the real names of these films"
2,Disappointment,"I would have returned this if I wasn't so lazy. The knob is difficult to turn and even when you can turn it, the dressing cover doesn't open so you have to manually open it and possibly spill dressing. The ice pack drips on the food making the food somewhat soggy.Great idea. Lousy execution."
1,Really bad design,"You gotta wonder what the folks who designed this thing were thinking. Did they really believe that the goofy little dressing compartment wouldn't leak like a sieve? Did they really think that people wouldn't notice?I feel like a dolt for buying the thing -- and I have no explanation for all the 4 and 5 star reviews. Maybe they're from people who only use super-thick dressings on their salads? Maybe they're from people who work for the company? All I can tell you is that with a vinaigrette-type dressing, it's useless.The only positive note is that because I'm apparently a valued customer (whoo-hoo!), Amazon is going to process a refund without making me ship the thing back. Kudos, Amazon.In short: DON'T BUY THIS. IT DOESN'T WORK."
3,Dressing leaks,"This is a nice item in most respects. The cold pack keeps salad fresh through lunchtime and beyond. But like so many reviewers, I find the dressing container inadequate. It does leak; unless you use only very thick, creamy dressing, you'll find that after a few hours, much of the dressing has seeped out of the container.No cigar."
1,Doesn't work as promised,"I purchased the Fit & Fresh salad shaker to take salads to work without putting the salad in the refrigerator. I only used the container a few months before getting rid of it. The first lid with the ice pack was very difficult to remove. I ended up with salad everywhere a few times when I pulled off both lids accidentally. The salad dressing container in the second lid leaked after a couple of months, leaving my salad wilted and slimy at lunchtime. Still looking for a solution for my lunchtime salad and dressing."
2,Salad shaker,"The amount of salad it holds is wonderful but the biggest problem that I had was turning the knob to open the salad dressing container! It was extremely difficult to turn and so I don't use it any longer. I would not recommend getting this salad shaker unless you have very, very, strong fingers - ok for most men, but not if you've got a weaker grip."
2,Salad keeper,The concept is good the product stinks. When I put my dressing in the white cap part it leaked all over the salad and it was closed. So I tested it by putting water in the cap and correctly placing it on the lid and it still leaked. I already opened it and used it so it can't be returned. You can still use this product but you'll have to find another place to store your dressing.
5,salad shaker,My husband takes a soggy salad with salad dressing poured on it to work every day. This product will make his salad quite wonderful - the lucky guy. It's a great idea for him and a great stocking stuffer.
1,Doesn't Work With Vinaigrettes,"I love the idea of this product, but in reality it doesn't work at all for me. I have been trying to persuade the dressing container to keep my vinaigrettes contained but no matter what I do they leak into the main salad compartment, sometimes in a few minutes, usually in a few seconds. Good idea, poor execution."
2,"Great concept, but I wish it worked!","I was looking for a salad shaker that would fit plenty of other ingredients aside from lettuce, and this seemed like a great match. The salad container itself is very roomy, big enough to store a filling salad. However, the dressing holder did not work at all for me, which kind of defeated the purpose of this container. I like to use vinaigrettes, and the dressing holder would leak every time... I even triple-checked that it was snapped into place and sealed. I think this dressing compartment would work only if you use thicker salad dressings. Unfortunately my salad was a soggy mess at the bottom every time I used this container! Very disappointed :-("
1,"Great concept, but....","This product worked great at first. Crisp, cold salads, convenient design. Shortly, though it got harder and harder to turn the knob to release the salad dressing. I had to start using a pair of pliers that I happened to have in my desk drawer. Then, today the whole dressing compartment fell out and landed face down on the rug. Guess I'll go back to my old, much less expensive plastic bowls."
2,It would be great if...,I would love this product if the salad dressing didn't leak out of the little container but it does so I don't... :(
5,I love this salad container!,"It keeps the salad cold, it is nice size and I love how it holds the salad dressing and it seems to be just the right amount. I would recommend this purchase. It was received quickly and as advertised."
4,Use it every day for lunch!,"I love this container. I carry a salad every day in it, and I no longer have lettuce soggy with dressing by midday. The only thing I wish I could have found is the Fit & Fresh that my friend has -- it's the same, but has a little compartment for keeping plastic utensils. Other than that, this is perfect. I would recommend to anyone!"
5,healthy salad,This product is great for salad eaters and is complete with a place for your utensils and for the dressing. It washes clean without the oily residue that most plastic containers keep. Overall a great buy? I think so.
5,Great for lunches!!!,I use mine everyday for lunch.. I lost 27 pounds by bring salad everyday.. Thank you for shipping so fast.Would order from here anytime..
1,Are You Kidding,"Back to the Drawing board. This is the dumbest item I have ever seen. The plastic to plastic seal for the dressing is ridiculous. Its not even close on the seal. The dressing leaks out in minutes. I wish I could get my money back. This should be taken off the market, until someone figures it out.I always have good luck at Amazon, this is a product they should throw out the window, instead of hampering their reputation.This should be sold on JUNK.COMThanks a lot for NOTHING"
1,Didn't work,"I was so excited about these containers. What a great idea, however the two that I bought didn't work. The knobs to the compartments that contains the salad dressing had to be screwed on so tight to keep the flap from dumping the dressing in transport that it was impossible to undo the knob without a pair of pliers! There is always the chance that I did get two duds, currently working with the company on a return."
4,"Works great, but you need more than one.","I love this salad shaker. It holds plenty of salad. As a side item, in a plastic baggie, I put crackers or bread. It would be really neat if they had a compartment for that. I only gave it 4 stars because the spfork and knife that come with it are a little small. However they are made out of a stronger plastic than what usually comes in a picnic utensil pack. The dressing compartment holds the perfect amount of dressing for the size salad you can pack in there. And with everything except the ice pack being dishwasher-safe, it's pretty easy to clean. I need two or three of these things just to last me to my next wash cycle! Great product."
4,"Big salad, tiny spork","First off: this is a really great container. There's plenty of room for a good-sized lunch salad; honestly, if you can't fit a full salad with all the goodies on top, then you probably need to double check your portion size. I actually have enough room left over to tuck a baggie of sugar snap peas on top for a snack. The ice pack works just like they claim, and it's still almost completely frozen by the time I eat lunch!The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the included spork is a bit of a joke. It's pretty small, but I guess you could rationalize that it makes you eat slower so you get full before you pig out. I've never worried about the utensils breaking, but I think they could've included one of the bigger folding forks like one of their other conatiners has. All that being said, the sporkette isn't enough of a problem for me to not love this container."
5,Fit & Fresh Salad Shaker,"I really like this container for taking salads to work, it really keeps the greens crisp, and because the dressing is in it's own container, you don't get to lunch and find wilted, soggy salad. It holds six cups and the first time I used it I put the salad in too tightly making in hard to dispense the dressing and shake up. You need to leave the salad loose enough to allow the dressing container to turn when you twist it to release the dressing. If you do, you will have a great salad for your lunch!!!!"
4,A Salad Eater Must-have!,"This product was wonderful! I love the convience of have the salad and the dressing in both the container. Before I would have to tote the huge salad dressing bottle. The compartment makes it so easy to store your dressing and then add it in when you ready to eat. My only complaint is that the fork storage on top would be better if it could hold a regular size fork. Also the container and the dressing compartment tends to be a little cumbersome to clean if you have to clean it every day. But still, this product makes your life easier!!!"
1,"Maybe I got a bad one, but...","First off, I can't turn the little lid for the dressing. The idea is that you open the dressing, shake it all up, and then open the lid to a dressed salad. Unfortunately, my salad ends up dressed on one half, unless I take half a bowlful, which is not enough for my main meal of the day.The ice pack gets hopelessly coated with salad dressing, even when the greens don't. The plastic utensils broke on me within a week. When I finally applied all my hand strength to open the darn dressing cup, the blessed thing broke.Nice idea, poor execution. There's got to be a better way. I'm very disappointed - looking at other reviews for Fit & Fresh products, I think I'll just steer clear of them. I'm back to Lock&Lock; containers in a lunch cooler, or my Lock&Lock; bento set."
1,Fit & Fresh Salad Shaker,"I purchased this item thinking it would be nice to take a salad to work. The plastic bowl is solid, everything else is cheap. The dressing dispenser broke before I could even put dressing in it. The knife and fork are cheaper than what you would get at a drive thru for disposal. I only rated it a one because zero wasn't an option. Save your money and buy regular plastic tubs. The extra blue ice and so called plastic ware isn't worth it."
3,"Useful, but bulky","I love the idea of having a way to have the salad stay fresh and mix the dressing right before eating it. This product executes that idea well enough, but there are a few faults:* If the dressing is creamy, it takes a while for it all to drop. It's a lot easier to just open it all and scoop it out with your knife.* The fork and knife are way too short. If you're trying to grab something from the very bottom of the tupperware, you are basically sticking your hands in there.* It's way too ""boxy"". I wish it was wider and not as tall, so it would fit better in backpacks and bags and the like."
2,just ok,"came with lid cracked, still functions for now but not impressed the salad dispenser is a good concept except when you ""dispense' the dressing onto a full salad it just sticks to the top of the container... my tupperware salad on the go was much more expensive but proving to be worth the money"
3,Fit & Fresh Salad Shaker,"I purchased three of these Salad containers. I liked the concept of the ice pack built into the lid. I didn't care about the dressing dispenser that everyone else complains about, I haven't used it. The size of the container holds alot of salad and has enough room for my small dressing container. It keeps the salad cold all day. However, after two weeks of use the ice pack leaked at the seems and dripped into my salad. I hand washed all the pieces and placed the ice pack flat in the freezer each time, being careful not to let it get damaged. Other reviews claim the dressing dispenser won't turn after the lid has been placed in the dishwasher. This item is useless if it breaks so quickly."
3,love it but can't open it,"I really like the size, shape of this salad shaker, but am disappointed in the salad dressing dispenser. It only worked one time, then never again! My co-worker also has one and has the same problem. We called the company and they said spray it with PAM. We did that and still it doesn't work. I would recommend the company work on this problem as I probably would not buy another one until they fix this problem."

3,"Okay, Really Miniature but Fun if You Like Small Things","Let's face it, this is not meant to really be a great tabletop Zen garden. It's 4"" wide.So if you're buying it for a mini fun set (we keep ours on the windowsill in the powder room) it serves its purpose. But it has two major flaws. One, the rake is too awkward to actually make any kind of a fun rake line. Two, the garden is too shallow and as soon as you rake, the sand goes over the edge - no matter how easy you move it.But, I like miniatures so this is fun to have just because. And my kids love it. But we also made our own in old cigar boxes. Much easier to play with."
1,DO NOT BUY,"Horrible purchase. The stone houses came broken, and the garden is about 2inches by 2inches. It can fit in the palm of my hand. How ridiculous! Pay the extra 10 dollars and get a normal size one."
2,too small and cheap,"This was purchased for my hubby's birthday for his desk at work... I thought it would be cute since its so small but its alright, he doesn't really like it lol. It doesn't even balance in the desk the legs are uneven... Cheap"
3,should give size,"The mini zen garden is really cute, fits on my desk great but I think they should give some measurements on this as its much smaller than I had thought upon purchasing"
4,Okay,The zen garden is great for an office or a small center piece to a peace seeking surrounding. Easy to add natural stones.
3,Tiny garden good for the office,This is a great little (and I do mean little) piece for the office. But do keep it where only you can play with it... It does attract an audience that can be annoying and get sand on your desk!! It's a nice way to get a little relaxation for a couple minutes.
4,The Great Book!,"In this book two girls are competing agaist each other. One sells lemonade to beat the other at getting more money. But one has a ugly sign and the other has a nice one. They don't know what to do. Well, if you want to hear more about this book you should read it!This book is the best book ever. If I could read this book again I would. This book was so splendid. If you already have a book, when you are finished check this one out!"
4,One of the 1980s R&B scene's most important figures.,"Kashif was one of the most prolific and innovative R&B producers/songwriters of the 1980s. He produced and wrote numerous smash hits for the likes of Melba Moore, Evelyn King, Whitney Houston, Kenny G. and George Benson (among others) and is deservedly viewed as one of 1980s R&B's most important figures. This superb collection features the timeless ""Are You The Woman"", ""Baby Don't Break Your Baby's Heart"", ""Help Yourself To My Love"", ""Stone Love"" and ""Love Me All Over"" as well as duets with Melba Moore, Dionne Warwick and Meli'sa Morgan. I diodn't give this CD five stars, however, because the title track of his ""Send Me Your Love"" album was (surprisingly) ommitted."
5,Another Genius That Was Under Rated!!!!!,"Kashif, was a musical genius in the 80's and 90's, helping various artist with their own productions as well as a well arranged writer, producer and performer with off the hook lyrics and melodody hooks. It's really a shame that we don't miss something until it's gone. I have to say that the sould and musical style of Kashif is really missing from our music today. He had a certain style and flair about his craft that still today I am trying to hear in other musicians. Like I said before......don't take music forgranted.....for all we know it maybe alittle too late to enjoy it, so I say to you buy this CD and you will see as well as hear that Kashif is really missed and totally under rated. Dayum this guy is awesome!!!!!! Just listen to ""Help Yourself To My Love"". You'll see!!!!"
5,One of a Kind!,This CD is Priceless. There are few musician's around today who can weave notes into such awesome dance grooves and melodic ballads. I miss his style.
1,Missing Parts,The order was missing the cable for connecting the phone (M-610) to the computer (USB)
1,Hoping For More,"The description for this video said it was compelling argument for the case of creation and existence of God. The very first example they give is thunderstorms are an incredible spectacle, must be created by God. We know that thunderstorms are created when warm air rushes upward and cools. They also state that lightning is the same temperature as the surface of the sun. That's not even close to correct.I was really hoping for scientific breakdown of where science fails to explain the universe around us and creation by God is a logical explanation. Instead, I got the same thing I've always heard: The world around us is awesome, has to be God!This video fails to try and convice non-believers and instead reinforces Creationists beliefs by affirming what they believe with no real substance."
1,Bad.,"This is one of the worst arguments for creationism I have ever witnessed. The entire concept of the film consists of presenting wondrous natural phenomena, pointing to vague quotes in the bible, and referring to the testimony of creationists who have studied science. These creationists explain, in scientific terms, wonders like lightning and DNA, somehow concluding that such intricacy could only be the makings of God. No reference to how this is logical. Totally unconvincing."
1,Completely ridiculous and not based on ANY actual facts or science,Don't waste your money on this junk. It is not a factual science based documentary and there are SO many good REAL and TRUTHFUL DVDs out there. The fact that this DVD completely IGNORES the science of nature is just SO FRUSTRATING. PLEASE don't allow your children to watch this as you don't want them to grow up ignorant...they need REAL education based on REAL science. Buy National Geographic's Journey to the Edge of the Universe instead!!! A MUCH better and FACTUAL option. This is simply a ridiculous sales video for religion and should not be taken seriously
2,Dissapointed,"This video had some great information on design; some nice footage. It spoiled it for me when it became a platform for preaching as the message conveyed was inaccurate and offensive to me. Thus, the video ended up in the garbage. Too bad."
2,God of Wonders is a nice video.,Product was damaged. Video skipped. It is difficult to return it since I gave it as a gift. Now what?
5,Please make more!,We really need more films like this available. How about a TV series that we can look forward to each week that covers different species of plants and animals showing how a Creator designed them? There just isn't enough available right now. 99% of the nature shows are geared towards evolution. It is far too lop-sided.This is a great film that I would highly recommend to Christians of all ages. They do not go into a battle here with evolution. But rather they simply present everything so it points directly to our Creator. I enjoyed that about the film. The joy of nature and science is lost when it turns into a hostile debate.I extend a friendly challenge to evolutionists to watch this film. Nature is far too precise and complex to have just magically fell into place over billions of years.
5,A DVD Winsome Beyond Expression!,"This exploration of our embodied star and the terrestrial galaxies positioned beyond captures you in the wanderlust of astonishment.We had friends over for the first viewing and all of us were enthralled through the entire excursion around our globe and into the heavens. As a bird enthusiast and one who writes for ""Lee's Birdwatching Adventures"" website, I soared to new heights through the winged wondered technology explanations. You simply sit in awe of the presented facts and the magnificent cinematography that captured earth's inhabited creatures.There is no way anyone can honestly question the Composer of the spheres after viewing these intricacies set before them. I cannot think of any creation video that is better equipped for reaching those who do not personally know the Creator--Jesus Christ.This is the perfect gift for anyone."
5,"Amazing, a must see",This is amazing! Everyone should see it. It will enhance the way you look at everything on this earth. I recommend it for all ages. Great for the whole family.
4,God of Wonders,"A very good video with a lot of beautiful, magnificent graphics. I would recommend it to everyone."
4,God of Wonders,Beautiful and awesome. Informative and thought provoking. It's one of those you want to see again and again and share it with others.
5,more than a 5,"There is no number high enough to rate this incredible movie about our God of Wonders and His creation so magnificent. If you watch it ONCE, I will guarantee you will share and watch over and over again. The photography is incredible depicting the amazing beauty created for us by a God who loves the world so much.......John 3:16"
4,compelling and well made,We viewed this in our home bible study group and enjoyed it thuroughly. This would also be a great dvd to give to someone who has not been introduced to the alternative view of intelligent design. It is very compelling and excellently produced.
5,God of Wonders,"This is a beautifully filmed and well researched production! Not only are the scientific findings thoroughly stated but the scripture has been studied and comprehensively applied, and communicated, to the audience! God is awesome...and some of His wonders are viewed here!!!"
5,came quick and works good.,This is a good replacement unit. It fit a 1986 sportster 1100 to which we also got a new speedometer. These units are all made with insufficient tab strength and the manufacturer should make that metal thicker but this is the same as any unit you can buy and it works just fine.
2,Unimpressive solar system display,This could be improved with a sun and perhaps better way to display the planets. You have to balance them between the 4 wires (before sticking down) which causes a lot of unbalancing and patience.
3,Make your own frame,"The crossbars for this were really small, so the planets are all jumbled up. The stickers are tiny, but glow nicely."
5,Fits the bill,Perfect for situations where clear backpacks are required by schools. These are hard to find.
1,poor quality,"My children needed clear bags for school. I doubted the quality for the price, but the reviews were good. I should have trusted my instincts. Both bags I bought (for 1st and 3rd graders without hardback books) tore up before mid year. Now I have to buy 2 new school bags."
5,The best thing to come out of Boston in a looooong time,"I found this album to be the cutting edge of Contempory/Urban gospel music. The material is diverse, the harmonies complex, the rhythem sweet and the whole project full of energy. I live in the UK and most of the gospel artist hail from US cities i.e. NY, Chicago, Detroit, LA. Boston MA. is never mentioned, but it's now on the map in a BIG way. Very similar in style to Charles Woolforks' Praise Covenant, I think these are two artist who are well worth keeping an ear out for....More, Please...."
3,WISDOMSEEKER,Here to Praise is a youth and young adult choir that can really sing. It helps make up for some of the poor choices of songs. There are only about 4 or 5 solid good songs on this album. If Here to praise found a better producer this choir would be great!!!
3,Not a real cordless phone - misleading,This phone is not a cordless phone - it comes with a hands free headset and STYLE of a cordless phone.
3,This phone is NOT cordless,I ordered this phone for my daughter for christmas. Just for clarification this phone is NOT cordless. The stated description on amazon is wrong. This phone is cute and great for kids but if you are looking for a cordless phone do not buy this one!
3,Porter's Bristle Shaving Outfit,"Nice outfit, but brush is a little too soft for working up the lather. A bit more pricey than I would like."
5,Porter's Bristle Shaving Outfit,I bought this as a gift for my son and he absolutely loved it. The quality and the price were perfect!
3,misleading photo,Do not let the photo fool you. I ordered these handles thinking I was getting two handles for a good price but when I received my order it was only one handle. After a long conversation with the company they did refund me my money that is why I gave them a rating of 3.If you are looking for handles there is a company that offers handles for far less in fact one of the cheapest prices I found woodworkershdw.com.
4,The Prodigy,The Prodigy is one of those little known independent films that is both charming and thought provoking. The characters are real and believable if not always polished. The two main characters Tony anad Nathan are from two very different words but both share some common problems. In the end they become good friends and both of their lives are changed forever. This is a must see for anyone who believes in hope and the human spirit and for anyone who loves a happy ending. I plan to add this one to my personal library. I hope to see more of young Jeremy Isaiah Earl who played 13year old Nathan. Jeremy was a real stand out with his charm and wit and came across as very genuine in the role of Nathan.
4,Sometimes big things come in little packages,"An abused child seeks refuge in a frat house of all places. Sounds silly? Not really. It is there that he is given the freedom to be a child in the company of immature young men. Although he is not well developed in academics, he sure does know about the importance of love and caring for one another. You can't help but love Nathan Jones in this story. Jeremy Isaiah Earl is splendid. The Prodigy touched my heart and I hope it touches yours."
3,A tale of kindness,"This movie speaks to anyone who has felt the sting of mistreatment in a gentle, comic manner. Congrats to Mr. Mcdougal and the whole team..."
1,Elemis Skin Nourishing Milk Bath,I found this skin cream expensive at $50+ and no better than a $10 product. I would not purchase this product again.
5,The Greatest Athlete of All Time,"Jim Thorpe was an American icon to several generations, and new generations will discover him through this."
1,Not that great,"My son has a lot of Sassy toys and I had been looking for a toy for him to use while he was in the car seat. I saw this at the store and it looked cute, so I bought it. It was easy enough to install in the backseat, but he toys never hung right and it wasn't easy for him to play with. I ended up returning it and getting the Tiny Love Car Bar. He love the car bar and plays with it all the time. Don't waste your money!!"
1,Great idea-Poor execution,"I bought this thinking it would be a great toy for my son. Which it would have if it were made a little better. As other reviewers stated, the bar did not attach well and the little animals would never stay on. Also, the way it's supposed to attach to the seat is not designed well either, so it didn't hang properly. I ended up just attaching the animals to a bar on the back of my front seat, but they still didn't want to stay on. It's just not worth it."
1,"Good idea, poor design","I bought this today for my 2.5 month old son because we often take day trips to see family and friends. Since we have other products by Sassy that we really like I didn't research this product before buying it. Boy, was that a mistake.The little straps that hold the animals onto the bar are not long enough to actually hold the animal securely. One of them is so short all I have to do is barely swat at it and it comes off. Another won't stay velcro'ed at all. The bar is difficult to get attached into the holes and is also too short so the mobile itself ends up being bent over.My son was interested in the jingling noises the animals made, but overall this is such a poor design, it's going back to the store of purchase tomorrow and I'm going to look for something else."
2,Entertaining for the baby but obnoxious for the mommy,"This item does hold the attention of my baby, but the toys are constatny comming off...the bar accross the front has never worked very well and it always gets in the way when we are putting in the car seat...We finally got another ""whosit"" to hang on the seat because for some reason my son LOVES it. I wouldn't spend the money on this."
2,Not worth the $$,"We got this when our daughter was 2 months old. The animals that hung from it were constantly in the way whenever we tried to put the baby carrier in the base. It hung down way too low, and the hanging animals were so low that they kept getting stuck under her seat. We finally got rid of the mat part, and she uses the animals as toys. At 9 months now, she is getting bored in the carseat so we are looking for another toy for the seat."
4,it has its problems but my daughter really loved the animals!,"there are some problems with the mobile---it is not as sturdy as it could be---so we just used the animals that attach as toys---and my daughter loved them! they are well constructed, bright and colorful, and they function kind of like a rattle. although we don't have it mounted in the car, we carry it in the car and it easily entertains her. she also enjoys looking at herself in the mirror. although it has it's faults, it was worth the money for us in that it kept my daughter entertained!"
3,Gave it as a gift. I have no useful user comments for this item,I am sorry. The item was purchased as a gift and therefore I have no useful information about the quality and usability of the item. I gave it 3 stars because it caught my eye and I bought it.
4,Where is Volume 3?,"And years later and still no Volume 3. Why? Come on guys you had to seen the cult following of the first two volumes. Anyway below would be my picks for Volume 3. Little more on the Sci-fi side as oppose to horror.Green Slime 1968Cyborg 2087 - 1966Godzilla -v- Mothra(The Thing) 1964Superman and the MoleMen 1955?Black Sunday (Barbara Steele) 1960Yeah, I know these aren't all if any Universal Pics, but I'd buy this if it were in a collection and I'd think others would too."
4,Purchase from Best Buy now for $17.99!,"Good basic set. Nice transfers, good sound. Some trailers, but no other extras. Limited edition exclusive through Best Buy where I purchased my copy for $17.99. If interested, buy now before greedy scalpers take over with ridiculus pricing!Perhaps one day when MCA/Universal smarts up, they will place these and their other classsic sci-fi movies in a deluxe box set with plenty of extras, but until then, this set will do."
2,Just couldn't get into it,"Okay, MAYBE my view would have been different had I not played Vice City beforehand, but I have and so the Getaway gets a poor review. The cutscenes are top-notch, almost Hollywood quality, and I hate to say this, but having the f-word just makes the game cooler. The pros stop there though!Gamepley is awful. The main character moves slowly and awkwardly. Cars handle realistically, but that doesn't mean they handle in a playable manner. I do like how the cars run poorer and poorer as they get more and more damaged, but the damage itself is unrealistic. The camera is awful, never in the right place. Controls are bad as well, sure you have autoaim, but you basically just have to hold down R1 until everything is dead, because there is no telling what it is you are shooting at. I could go on and on, but the fact is that I don't care enough about this game to put it down, I just want to warn you gamers out there. I'm going back to Vice City!"
4,Should be made into a movie!!!,"I bought this game used and overall I've enjoyed it. People keep comparing this game to GTA, but this game is way better. The graphics are good and I love the fact that you really are in london unlike the GTA games which is just in a made up city. This game has a really good story line. It's not all about sex or drugs. It actually has a deep meaning to what is going on in the game. I hate the fact that the video cuts are long and you have to watch it for like 2 minutes before playing the game but when you actually do play a mission it is worth the wait. In the end the game is probably the best game I have ever played. I'm waiting for some hotshot director to make this into a movie cuz it really should be."
2,Definitely try to get away from this game,"I'm being genereous with 2 stars. I thought this was simply a horrible game. The driving was incredibly hard and this is coming from a Gran Turismo addict. Even if you can ignore that, meandering through the levels *trying* to shoot your way through levels is less than fun, it's more like a chore. I imagine the programmers were *trying* to outdo Vice City but it just comes off horribly wrong. Whatever, I'd rent this before spending any serious cash on it."
5,One of the best games ever!,This game has to be the most realistic game. The cars look real and there is real body damage not just panel damage. The game will definatly be a challenger to the Grand Theft Auto series. I am not saying GTA [...is bad] because it is probably the best game but this game is equal in gameplay.
1,Horrible,"The Getaway is a repetitive rip-off of the GTA series and it's only merit is it's decent story line that cashes in on the recent popularity of British ganster movies such as Guy Ritchie's Snatch (2000) and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998). The makers of The Getaway have substituted cinematic quality for any trace of entertaining gameplay. The driving is supposed to be realistic but real cars go faster than 40 miles per hour. Instead of handling with surprising realism, the vehicles drive like they are soaked in molasses. Utterly horrible. Give your $50 to charity."
1,Too Much Down Time,"You can not skip cut scenes. Every time you play a level you have to sit through the whole 10 minute cut scene, no matter how many times you've seen it. Also, when the character is on foot, he heals by leaning on the wall. Cool concept, but I spend so much time waiting for him to heal. You just sit there and watch him breath for like 60 seconds. It really adds up after a while. Between that and the cut scenes, this game winds up being a huge waist of time. It's a shame, it looks great, and the driving parts are very cool. There's just too much down time. I suggest getting a book or magazine to read while playing this game."
1,Worst Controls Ever !!!,"I just can't play this game. I want to like it, but I just can't. The controls are HORRIBLE. The camera view is a DISGRACE. I can't see where the heck I'm going. I am an experienced gamer but I just can't get past the first level. I keep trying then end up yelling and cursing. I thought about BREAKING the game. Now I'm here looking at what this game goes for and am thinking about selling it. I almost feel bad about passing on this piece of garbage to someone else."
4,This Game Is Great!,"This game is fun.You don't have to beat the game to get Free Roam,look in the ""Tips & Tricks"" magazine for codes such as to unlock Free Roam.This game has cars that exist in real life such as a Lexus,Saab,Honda,and more!In Free Roam,you can tour London and drive wherever you want.Be warned,there are cops and if you try to steal a gangster car,they will shoot at you.There are some cons of this game:poor camera angles,no health bars or health pickups,the missions are hard,and you cant skip the cutscenes in the missions.I still found this game to be fun.I mostly like Free Roam.You should probably rent this first."
1,"Horrible game, not fun, gets boring quick","I had such high hopes for this game, and it was horrible. Basically, if you love driving very far from point A to B many many times, then this is the game for you. If you like action, and missions that aren't the same kind every time, this this isn't the game for you. It may be cheap right now, but it's still not worth it.The controls are horrible, and the game's difficulty is just driving."
4,Brilliant Game,GO OUT AND BUY THIS GAME.This is a great game and is beyond quality that Vice City will put out. London looks great and so real. The graphics are real quality - you will be impressed by these graphics the moment you turn on the PS2 - very impressive.
4,Decent Game bu Wondering About the Soundtrack,This Game had many flaws but is still decent. The targeting system was aweful. You target people 50 yards away instead of someone right in front of you shooting you to death. What I'm really wondering about though is the Jamaican Rap song playing when you are the cop and you have to raid the drug house with all the marijuana plants. Anybody know?
4,Good game,"I say good game not great, because some of the details aren't great but you can't do free roam mode until you beat the game! But on some missions I will just go and play around 'cause I might just get bored. So I think this is a good game with a good story plot. I personally think its worth the money so thats why I think it deserves 4 stars!!!!"
5,"The Getaway, a mix of games","This is one of the best games I have ever played. Although you do not get many different types of weapons, the gameplay makes up for it. This game is a mix of GTA Vice City, Dead To Rights and a few other games. It is much more realistic than GTA Vice City. It should take you about the same length of time to win as GTA Vice City. It is difficult at times and sometimes easy. There are 24 missions. 12 are as Mark Hammond, and the other 12 you play as a cop. When you win the game you can just go around london and do whatever you want like GTA Vice City. The only part that I dont like is that almost every mission you have to drive with the cops and other gangs chasing you. Also you have to watch the movie sequences. Overall this is a great game and I recommend it to any one who enjoys action/shooting games."
2,controls? what controls.,"cool idea, cool setting, good graphics, entertaining cut scenes with plenty of swearing, even the sound is good, but whatever is good about this game is completely let down by game controls and camera positioning that leave you getting shot in the back when all you want to do is pop around the corner and shoot the bad guys. It really is a shame. I wanted to like this game but as it stands I'm glad that I only rented it and didn't waste forty bucks."
4,Game good / Some Flaws,"The game concept is great. The whole mob scene, good stuff. The thing that pisses me off is the damn crippled controls of the character. Although I like the car controls, they are better than GTA3's cause they are more rough and more realistic. But when the character walks especially inside the buildings the view shifts from side to side, kinda annoying. I bought the game for 40$, reasonable price, thanks to Sony. And the cursing is awesome adding the accents they all have pretty entertaining.I say: Buy the game if your looking for something like GTA3 experience. Although its much different, you will have to adjust to the controls otherwise, its just plain old mob trying to get'cha!"
2,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"THIS GAME IS SO BORING AND HARD. MAYBE IF YOU ARE A SUPER GAME FREAK YOU CAN BEAT IT. THIS IS JUST ANOTHER CLONE OF GTA: VICE CITY, BUT IN LONDON.PROS:NICE CARSNICE GRAPHICSCONS:STUPID WAY TO REDEEM YOUR HEALTHBACKGROUND MUSIC IS SO ANNOYINGTOO MANY CARS, WHICH TAKES IT LONGER TO GO PLACESTO BEAT THE GAME YOU WILL NEED TO PUT IN MANY CHEATSTHERE IS NOT ANY COMPASS TO GUIDE YOU, SO YOU WILL SPEND MOST OF YOUR TIME LOSTTHERE IS NO FREEDOM, ALL YOU DO IS MISSIONS, MISSIONS, AND MISSIONSI THOUGHT THIS WAS GOING TO BE A HOT GAME, BUT I WAS VERY DISSAPOINTED!!!!!"
1,read this ...,im srry to say that this game is simply terrible. i thot i had a better chance of growing wings and flying away then beating the first level. the intro is bad and upsetting. its like your wife is murdered in front of ur 5 year old son whos then kidnapped. you have to chase down the bad people which is impossible. they probaly wont show this review cuz its not to great but i only have to say...The Getaway isnt worthy of a 1 star.
1,"Getaway, from me","If you want to be in an underworld environment get GTA:VC (Praise) and get an English guy to sit behind smoking a cigar saying ""Markie Boy"" ""Good job my son"" ""Want some afternoon tea?"" ""jolly good gov'ner"" ""where's the gaffer?"" ""you were only supposed to blow the bloody doors off"" "" three lions on the shirt"" ""1966"". The guy you play is called Mark and he runs stuck in like an alabama tick, he cant shoot, he fires blanks and so his wife is dead, either by a Bullet or boredom, we dont know.The guys out for revenge but mid game he ends up teaming up with the woman involved with killing his wife, talk about an idiot. Dugh!Basically Driver meets GTA meets a Army men 3D game with an element of ""cockney slang"" Why could'nt it of been staged in God-bless it these United States."
1,Ripoff of GTA..,"Plain and simple this game is a rip off of Grand Theft Auto. It must be nice for all of the UK fans to have a game based in their country, but it would have been better had it been an original idea."
1,Getaway from buying this game!,I highly suggest you rent this game or wait for the dozen of used version of this horrible GTA3 wannabee. The liberal use of the F-word thoughout the FMV was a turnoff. The game design is generic at best (limited camera angles) and the controls are bad. Seems to me they put this out quickly to ride the coattails of GTA:Vice City. I can't believe people was praising this game for being realistic?! What really turned me off was the totally stupid plot. You are suppose to commit crime and kill people (even your former best friends) to preserve the life of your son?! Come on!
3,Insanely Difficult game,"This game is ...UN-IMAGINABLY DIFFICULT. Do Not buy this game if you're not willing to endure lasting frustrations in trying to get to the next level. They don't let you skip the looong ass cutscenes they made for each and every level, you have to sit and watch them everytime. PLus there's a lack of proper save in this game, they don't let you save until you beat the whole missions. If you're born gifted with ps2 controllers and willing to endure what i described, you should buy this game. but otherwise, actual gameplay/graphics are incredible."
2,poor quality of design and production,"the game play is not all it is cracked up to be, there are many glitches in the game. Poor control of character when on foot. very little variables to control, for example weapons are very limited. WE have hade much better games in the past, programers should not take a step back in technology. RENT IT dont buy it!!! Any game where it takes like 10 times to finish different levels is extreamly frustrating and fun points go down fast... I regret buying this game."
3,good game overall,"Yeah, I figured this title to be a GTA rip-off with no depth or personality of its own. I also thought it wouldn't be very much fun to play, either. Well, I was wrong in all these areas. This is a solid game that has a lot under the hood, most of it good, some of it bad. The cut-scenes are too long. The controls are odd at times and so is the driving. But there is stil a lot to keep players interested. Lots of guns, lots of violence, and oh yeah they say the ""f"" word in here too. I was impressed. It aint GTA but it is still worth your cash."
3,Part one is excellent! Let down with Part two...,"The Getaway is an exciting game, set in the streets of London. You get to play two characters - Hammond (a man who knows life of crime) and Carter (a cop out to book his crooked boos). Travelling fast across the streets of London, you get to see all the land marks.The game starts with Mark Hammond's wife being shot, and his boy being taken.... then Mark is sent on wild goose chases to get his boy back, which involve many different gangs of London.I found part one as Hammond to be really good, and pretty difficult. Some levels were hard to complete.In the second part (levels 13 - 24), you play Carter. While it was fun driving through the streets in a cop car, I found the second part to be much easier to complete. All in all a great game. Oh, and remember in the UK they drive on the left...."
3,Average-But Not Vice City,"After several years in development, The Getaway realeses big with high anticipation for a great game. Team Soho, the developers, have a great storyline plot and BEAUTIFUL GRAPHICS, and it shows why the game took so long in development. The control scheme is difficult, but with spent time, they become simpler. This is a GTA [type game], where you rome the streets and are chased by the police to get from point A to point B. The great thing about this game is the excellent driving engine and rarely slowsdown on you. The game starts out with a man Mark Hammond whos wife gets murdered and son kidnapped by the London crime boss Charlie. Mark must travel throught the percisely detailed London to kill his fellow commrades to get his son back. This game has A LOT OF NEEDLESS SWEARING, and the selection of guns is limited to 3, AK47 and Shotgun and the classic, Pistol. Try this before you buy it. If you liked Driver 2, buy this."
3,Not GTA!,"So, the price is right for this game, I do recommend it, but be careful. The whole deal with the VERY slow British cars can get annoying to those who are used to the new GTA games where just about every car goes lightning fast. The gunfighting is definately more fun than the driving, since while you're driving you're pretty helpless and can't shoot out of your car. Another thing taking away all challenge is that there is no health pickups. You will gradually heal back to full health as you sit and wait and no one comes to attack you, so you can recharge yourself and pop back around the corner for another go at the nutters. I can't recommend it to GTA fans, but to fans of amazing stories and story-telling abilities I do recommend this game, it's like participating in a movie."
5,"Great Game, But Not Without Flaws","""The Getaway"" is one of the best games I've ever played. With great graphics and an entertaining storyline, it's ""Grand Theft Auto"" with style. In some areas it's better than GTA. The realism, graphics, and storyline are better than GTA's. Here are the pros and cons of this amazing game:Pros:Entertaining StorylineIncredible GraphicsRealisticGreat Assortment of VehiclesGreat CharactersPlays Like A MovieCons:Scenes In Between Missions Too Long, Can't Stop ThemSome Mediocre GameplayNeeds More WeaponsPlays A Little Bit Too Much Like A Movie SometimesLondon Streets ConfusingDamn British Accents Hard To Understand"
5,The Getaway is the best!!!,this game is great and there is nothing really else to say abut it exept that it is great and it is a lot better than Grand Theft Auto 3(gta3)and Grand Theft Auto Vice City(gtavicecity).
2,Glad I Rented It,"This game isn't as great as some reviewers would have you believe. It is NOT like the GTA games. The GTA games are free, loose and fun. The Getaway is stiff, humorless and frustrating. I appreciate the ability to drive through ""the real streets of London"", but you feel trapped in those streets. They're too narrow and congested and you have to obey all the traffic laws, otherwise you'll get a bunch of cops on your tail.When you're out of the car, the game gets even worse. The camera always seems to be looking the wrong way, which makes it difficult to deal with the bad guys that are shooting at you. There are no health or ammo meters---and I know that they were purposely omitted for ""realism"", but realism aside, it would be helpful to see your vitals.The Getaway is more like the Driver games---strictly mission based with no room for fun. I rented it, played it about twice and took it back. As the British would say: ""Fookin' Rubbish!"""
2,I Expected Better,"This game is ok. It is fun in certain ways such as taking hostages. It is kind of annoying when you have to spend half the game against the wall regaining your health. I bought this game thinking it would be a grand theft auto with a twist to it, but it is too difficult. You may enjoy hard games such as splinter cell, but if you are like me, you won't enjoy this game that much."
2,Meh!,"it wasn't really a great game. i mean, i heard it was so i bought it, then i played it for three days, then sold it on the fourth. It was boring. i found it way to hard on the second mission and it was a struggle to get past it! the one good thing about it is the graphics which are awsome. the graphics are what made me give this 2 stars; everything else just wasn't as exiting as other games i've played. after i sold it, i went out and bought grand theft auto vice city for LESS even though it is a way better game. i should have bought it first."
2,at least the commercials are neat,this game leaves alot to be desired...im very bored and frustrated with it. i have had it 3 days and i hate it. this was my first ps2 game that i bought. i have played gta3 and would suggest it over this to everyone.
2,Great idea - poor gameplay,This is a breakthrough game in the graphic treatment of the whole of London with a good gansta movie plot. A lot of ideas here are going to seem very familiar to GTA but with a slightly different twist. This is an OK game - but is could have been great. The designers forgot to put in decent gameplay. The first person shooter is pretty fun but the controls are a little clunky at times. The car scenes are just frustrating and dull - 10 plus minutes to drive across London to the next mission - its not that fun in real life. Worth trying it if you can find it cheap - if not wait till they come out with a version with a decent game involved.
5,This game is just cool,"Excellent game. Top of the game graphics, fun driving, action packed shooting role-playing game. Real injuries and the cars are just wicked my favourite is the lotus!!!!!!!!! The missions are just the best. Fave game at da moment..."
3,Englands verson of Grand Theft Auto,"When I saw the screen shots and read reviews of the Getaway, I immediately went out to buy the game. But after an Hour of playing I realized the Getaway was merely ENGLANDS VERSION OF GRAND THEFT AUTO. The only thing that makes it different then GTA is you have more control of your character. You have the ability to roll take hostages and sneak up on enemies and break their neck. The game is also more realistic and is much bigger but besides that there is no difference between GTA. The whole point is hijacking, killing, and completing missions."
4,Oh WOW!!!,The getaway has to be by far one of the best games i have played on the ps2 console... It's challenging enough to keep you playing but not so complex that you hate it... Awesome duel story lines and great graphics..The only thing that lacks is the angles and movement sometimes... But wow what a game.. If you like hitman and the latest gta's you will love this.... Don't pass this by..
4,What an RPG!!!,This game is so gangsta!! Had me on the edge of my seat trying to complete the missions. It's so addictive that I finished the game in a little over a week!! I say buy this game
2,A game that cesis to amaze me,"The get away, yet a great game, is not for all of us. I find it hard to have much fun when you only limp at a snails pace. You have to be a huge fan of this to have a lot of fun. I would consider making the over-all difficulty lessen or be able to select a difficulty for your own good."
4,I liked this book!,"I thought this book was an excellent reference. The explanations are clear. I must admit that some equations seem to be inadequately justified, but not to any greater extent than many other undergraduate texts, such as Eisberg and Resnick (the quantum book). This book went into the right amount of mathematical depth for someone like me who just wanted to get the 'big picture' for my thesis and not worry too much about the details. Much, much better than the books by Chow, Koch and Sargent, and Thompson.I might add that I am a physics major and thus have had considerable background in electromagnetism and quantum mechanics. Perhaps lack of background is why the Stanford engineer felt that the book was too hard."
2,Definately not an introductory laser book.,"This book uses math extensively to describe lasers ( granted math IS necessary). The book assumes you have a very good background in the subject material already. Still, not a bad book to have on the shelf to look in if you have some need for a deeper look at lasers. This is a book for people already advanced in the their understanding of lasers who seek further advancement. This is not an introductory book."
3,laser electronics,"The book will work for the student who is sufficiently prepared in quantum mechanics and electromagnetism. If one were to learn laser physics without the background of these classes, then they would be doing themselves a great disservice.The book covers lots of the ""bare-bones"" topics essential to understanding lasers. However, the book comes to a screeching halt when advanced derivations need to be completed, leaving it up to the reader to figure it out. The book does have extensive reference lists at the end of each chapter to supplement those deficiencies.Unfortunately there will not be a future edition to this book. This book is probably the best fit for a senior undergraduate course and not a graduate course (Yariv is probably a better fit at this conjuncture). The senior undergraduate will have to work hard in order to get the most out of this book!"
4,Too complicated for entry level student,This book is too hard for senior undergrad. student. It is better for advanced grad. student and sr. engineers.
4,Verdeyen Laser Electronics,"The definitive work on laser engineering. A good reference for all things laser. It's also a pretty good read, for a textbook. A copy of this probably belongs on the bookshelf of anybody in the laser/photonics field. There are many errors in it, for example the Einstein A coefficient listed for the Ne laser transition, so numbers should be double checked against other references."
4,From a Bygone Era,"The book is a very practical treatment of laser systems, avoiding the quantum mechanical complexities in favor of more electromagnetic approaches. There is a distinct skew towards classical gas laser. I think the challenges in laser science have moved past these kinds of systems: to a modern engineer discussing how to build an antireflective coating might be better then zeroing in on the special cases of low cavity loss. We need a book for the modern era, where students know how to solve Schrödinger's equations better than Maxwell's.The practical advice given by the book in construction of laser systems is not difficult, but many graduate students may not be familiar with the qualitative insights offered. Hence it is equally applicable for later undergraduates and beginning graduate students.Ultimately, if you are working as an engineer and are asked to build a death ray, this book is an excellent reference, but it falls short if you aim to learn fundamental physics."
1,Poor printing!!,"I actually can't believe they are selling the book as is. The alignment of the printing is awful! The cover is not only crooked, but the title is cut off both on the front cover and back cover. All the left-hand pages have a huge margin on the outside and tiny margin on the inside, making them difficult to read. For such an expensive textbook, you would think it might go through some kind of quality control process. Shame on Amazon for selling such a poor quality product."
2,Review of Laser Electronics,"Reads more like a technical manual than anything else. Does not provide much background knowledge. If it wasn't for the professor explaining problems in this book, I would not have an clue about where this book was going. Not a good college textbook at all."
3,should be sturdier and proofread,"the blocks are as beautiful as the books, to be sure. But:1. the blocks are pretty cheap/flimsy (surprising for how much they cost)2. the images are stuck on a little clumsily3. the ""attachments"" (ears on elephant, mouth on hippo) are fragile and can easily be torn off4. THERE IS A SPELLING MISTAKE -- hippopatamus?? You've got to be kidding.I would really have expected more from an Eric Carle product, all the rest of which my son loves dearly."
3,Dashiell's Mom,"These are beautifully designed and durable enough for my one year old. He's not chewing so much these days. But, the blocks weren't well designed for small children with the movable parts. As soon as he found the elephant ears and the hippo mouth they were goners. I decided to glue them down. Flat ears and a stationary mouth are more educational that no ears and only half of a mouth. It seems like the manufacturer should have figured that out. And, the spelling error is really sloppy."
5,An awe-inspiring work...,"A hauntingly beautiful and mysterious work. Jarrett basically 'reinvents' the baroque organ with this masterpiece of purely improvised material. Both melancholic and spiritually up-lifting, it is a pity that the entire set was not completely released."
2,"Decidedly ""B""",Moxy F's B cd is not upto their usual standard. Sorry boys I have all your stuff but this one got very little attention after a couple three plays. But then nobody can be perfect all the time.
5,Humor and musical ability combine in this euphoric album!,"Moxy Fruvous is a brilliant group, as is perfectly demonstrated on the B album. The songs are closer to a capella than usual, letting the witty lyrics shine. I'm a sucker for fun songs about math and science, so Entropy is a personal favorite. Try to memorize Johnny Saucep'n for a challenge. If you like Tom Lehrer, BNL, They Might Be Giants or the Dukesmen, go for the B album."
3,A spotlight for the band's satirical side,"While hardly the best album by Moxy Früvous, this is still a must-have for fans, and a good introduction for those who don't know much about the band. This album is actually a fairly short collection of B-sides, most of which are satirical songs with a liberal viewpoint, and a good amount of harmonizing. The objects of the satire here include Rush Limbaugh, the Premier of Ontario, trash television, and bosses in general. If you don't like this kind of stuff, you might not like the band, but there's also a lot more to them. I would highly recommend this album, but don't make it your ONLY Früvous album, or you'll be missing out on a lot of great stuff."
3,Roboreptile,"This toy is advertised as too rough (aggressive) and therefore not suitable for children ages 5 and under. That's laughable! This toy gets some smiles and giggles, because it resembles a tiny puppy. It is very gentle. Sure it swings its head and tail, but in a playful manner. It moves (walks) in an akward manner, again, similar to a puppy learning to walk. A child loses interest after about an hour or less. After the holidays, I'll keep it in its orginal shipping box and maybe in about 20 years, it'll have some antique value."
2,Keep Looking,"I got this originally for my 5 year old who is now 12. He played with about 20 minutes then its over and forgotten about. Then we had two more kids, a boy and a girl. Girl is 6 now and boy 5. Same deal they pretty much think awesome....for 20 minutes then forgotten about. It doesn't keep kids attention very long. To me it seems like a such a cool toy but the proof is in the pudding as they say and I have now tried it on all three kids and its a no-go, now headed for yard sale or sale online. Very disappointed in, considering the price. Keep your money and keep looking. All three of my kids have loved legos and the little lego action figures. We would have done much better getting legos instead of this. Same for the Robosapien, we tried it too and for our kids neither one was a hit. If you do decide to try it and your kids don't play with it much, don't keep it like I did thinking maybe 'later' they will play with it more because mine never did."
3,"Not what he expected, good entertainment for about a day",My son begged for this so I got it for his 10th birthday. It thrilled him to pieces for about a day and then has sat on his desk for the last year untouched.
3,robotic reptile,"this product give my familly a lot of fun, but it also wasted a lot of battery. can your company redesign this product using rechargeing battery. this way can save our money and also protect our earth.thanks"
3,What's With the Price??,I just saw this exact product on the shelf at Target for $50. It's also on the WowWee website for $50. What's with the $250 price on Amazon??
3,robotechnique.,"i seem to enjoy buying robots just so i can make them work.I had the battery problem. had to put in some light lithium batteries, then this little guy shot off like a rocket. a rocket with a permanent lean to the right, but im working on it.Ive already done reconstructive surgury to my robosapien, increasing his flinch and track responses to several feet. the reptile though, has just got a paint job so far.i mean this little guy cant go straight. im tinkering with balancing it, and adding stilts to the feet. left to roam, though, he just goes in circles. his sensors seem only to work part of the time, and he has yet to ""chase"" anything. (how can he, when he can only go in circles?)no idea if i can fix this apparent factory defect. no idea also how many are like mine.he is fun though, and like everyone says, worth half the price they asked for him on release. fire him up and let him go, an in minutes he'll be causing problems. tangled or stuck or in trouble with the dog."
2,Don't Bother,"Purchased one for my son for his birthday and was very disappointed. It does not move very well at all, on carpet he just barely moves, has a hard time doing anything really, especially moving along any floor, carpeted or not (wood and/or tile not really any better) I think the feet need redesigning, robots I bought him 4 years ago worked much better. Needless to say after one day it's in the garage goodwill box."
3,New Cat Toy,"Got this robotic reptile for the cat. (I figured I could use it to chase the cat and bite him once in a while to keep him on his toes.) I wasn't really happy with it's capabilities or the limitations of it's IR sensors. (It's blind most of the time and keeps running into the same object.) However, for the sale price I got it at, it's okay. The cat kind of likes it and does chew on it's tail once in a while. As others noted, problems on carpets. Also, doesn't move that fast. (No cat chasing.) Amazon's service great as normal."
2,"Neat technology, boring toy","Has a great 'gee whiz' factor right out of the box that quickly fades. I bought this for my 6 year old son who is a dinosaur and robot fanatic. He thought is was the greatest for about 4-5 hours. The toys motions and ability to interact, while very interesting, are just too slow to hold a child's (not to mention an adults) attention and encourage play.After the initial 'wow, this is sooo cool', the roboreptile has become an expensive still life sitting on my son's shelf. If you really need to see the roboreptile in action, grab one on ebay for $20. Then you won't feel so bad when you shelve it after a few hours."
5,Very Fun Toy!,"We bought this to play with our dog with, it has became the favorite toy of the house hold! We have had a blast with the cats and the dog with it and the grandaughter loves it along with the nephews.Altho it does eat the batteries I recommend rechargable they work great!When batteries are getting low it will not move to good on carpet that is why make sure you have good batteries for great Play."
2,Well below my expectation!,"I thought it should be fun, after I bought a roomba, which intelligently suck the floor without a need to programming. But this thing needs programming! Not an easy toy even for my 10 years old. She quickly get tired of it."
2,Not Quite WowWee,"My sons find the dinasour realistic, as a parent, you'll find it pretty annoying. The best place for my son to play with it is ouside, although it does not walk on grass but at least i don't have to listen to it. I didn't have high expectations for the toy and therefore, it didn't dissapoint me."
2,Is mine defective?,"I was excited to be able to play with this new toy with my 4yo son. I got brand new energizer batteries, popped them in and....it won't walk on the carpet and barely walks on the tile floor. It most of the time won't respond to the commands that are given and when left to roam he sits and screams or growls at us. The only part that is really fun is to set it on protect...that it likes. It snaps and growls at the older boys scaring them."
3,Roboreptile,"This is a very fun toy. We like to watch it in it's roam mode. It is like it is alive. We like to watch it eat. My 8 year old daughter who loves dinosaurs loves it. I confess, I took it one morning to watch it roam the kitchen for fun. -Mom of Dino crazed girl."
1,So Strange,"I like costume movies and thought this would be a good one, but it was just not believable or well acted. I just gave up."
3,Kinda gory.,Interesting in small doses. Glad I didn't see it in a theatre where one is a captive audience. At least viewing it at home I can pause it and leave the room once in a while. Dunno why I watched it til the end. Guess it had some plot.
2,bad story line,"Found it needing a better story, I was just bored with the movie and was hoping that it would get better but never did."
1,Boring and disgusting,"After an incredibly slow build up, the movie turns into a disgusting display of sadism that made me turn the TV off. The supposedly romantic scenes are boring, the sex scenes are not arousing, but the sadistic scenes (from a beautiful little girl killing a chick to baths in human blood) are stomach turning. Gosh! What a disaster!"
1,I like movies,"As someone who likes all kinds of movies, I thought that this selection would be a worthwhile watch. It was not finished."
3,Not Bad If You're Bored Enough,"I literally just clicked randomly so I'd have some noise while I did some work at the computer. Not bad for that, thought not good for much more.The acting was decent, though I did expect more from Delpy considering her past performances. What starts out as slow but intriguing lead-up turns into a fizzle with a short and poorly written ending. While I did like that it wasn't the bloodbath it could have been, given the subject matter and all, I was also disappointed by the shallowness of the players.I gave an extra star for the costuming and atmosphere which is the only thing I really liked about this movie."
2,Actors should not direct themselves in movies,"Actors should not direct themselves in movies (Clint Eastwood the only exception) and this proves the Rule. Julie Delpy wrote a halfway decent script but she needed outside Leadership to bring out the True spirit and Life of Erzebet Bathory. The acting was wooden and without life, and the script and supporting roles without depth. This could have been an amazing movie, maybe even Oscar worthy--true life, amazing settings and costumes, interesting story. But the direction and cinematography, the editing, made this a mediocre film barely worthy of note. Too bad. The life of Erzebet Bathory, the first recorded female serial killer, is one of the great mysteries of history and certainly worthy of better. I suggest you wait until Amazon drops the rental price to $1.99, or until Hollywood puts this in the hands of a better actress and director, before watching a movie about the Amazing Erzebet Bathory"
3,this movie is ok...,"i didn't see what alot of other people seen in this movie,but i did enjoyed it thou i would say its worth watching...theres alot more versions of this movie so i can't see the truth about it..."
3,Very Graphic and Dark,"Although this was a graphic and dark movie I did learn a lot about the pre vampire history in Europe. Actually, this film makes sense of the whole idea of ""living on blood"" world. The movie presents a feeling of a subtitle Swedish film without the subtitles...little emotion...lots of silent still shots...like I said dark..."
3,Forced dialogue,"Throughout most of the movie the dialogue was delivered with less skill than I've seen at a high school play. The story was well done, but the acting was painful to watch, which was shocking as I normally love Julie Delpy. Not her best work."
2,Not A Story Worth Retelling,"The story of the Blood Countess -- as she was called -- was not worth retelling. Her story is one of pure evil, cruelty and insanity. There is nothing enjoyable about it. I agree with the reviewer that said only people who like blood and gore movies could possibly enjoy this film. I thought it was horrible. Not even the costumes could save it."
2,Color me unimpressed,"This was listed as a suggested viewing for me, based on previous movies I've viewed through Amazon. It looked promising - had some decent actors and set during a time period I enjoy. While the settings and costumes were excellent - and the acting wasn't too bad - it was difficult to get through the entire movie. The story is disjointed, the dialogue simplistic - there is no flow, no build up of drama or tension. Excessively bland for what looked to be an interesting premise. I didn't hate it - thus the two stars - but I do not recommend."
2,Blood and gore,This film is for horror fans only. If you want a well acted enjoyable evening choose something else.The costumes were well done.
3,"interesting story, not so great acting","The story of this deranged countess and her thirst for virgin blood to restore her youth is compelling enough, but the main actress and some of the others are not so great, which mars an otherwise decent production."
1,The Countess,"I tend to like movies set in this period but, unfortunately, this was boring. The Countess had no substance and no character. She was supposed to be a strong woman but her love affair with a much younger man was pathetic and, therefore, not worth the time spent watching it."
4,Framed?,"Power and money on her end and an indebted King on the other is never a good thing. Throw in an opportunist and a blood thirsty Church and it wouldn't be hard to frame the Countess. Did she do any of it? I'll guess your going to have to be the judge. As the movie points out, only the victors write history books and as an example one could use Constantine and the Nicene Counsel."
3,Disturbing,"The summary Amazon gives about this movie are misleading and inaccurate...something about a strong woman in a man's world. No, this film is about the 'Bloody Countess' who killed and tortured hundreds of young women under her rule for the sake of vanity and satisfaction. In fact, the movie turned her story into a ""woman lost into depths of despair over love lost"" rather than the historical account given during her trial of ultimate sadistic torture and mass murder. The movie is somewhat slow paced, although interesting at times and well acted. The real story is more horrific than even Hollywood could come up with. If you watch this, don't google the real facts afterwards, they will haunt you in your dreams..."
3,Not the most complete version,"I'm not sure how many versions of this movie are floating around, but even the more ""uncut"" version in this package is not as complete as the Thai DVD I originally purchased prior to this movie being released in the USA. A prime example of an omission is the elephant thief at the party that suddenly has blood around his mouth and complains of losing his teeth. In the version I originally owned (either lost or in some box in storage now), Tony Jaa was seen very clearly to cause his loss of teeth. It was a very visceral scene, so I noticed it's absence immediately. There may be more scenes missing, but I did not continue to view this version after determining (I even put the non ""uncut"" version in to see if they were just labeled incorrectly) it was not as complete as I expected."
4,The Protector,"Who knew there were protectors out there for elephants? That is the story line for this movie. The fighting style is very unique and this character handles it well. The end of this movie doesn't really gel as it leaves a lot to be imagined, but the movie itself is well worth watching."
3,really?,"This movie isn't that great. I'm not going to list a lot of examples, but I will say that it could have been a lot better given the cast and staff involved."
2,The Protector,It is a pity that Tony Jaa's skill is wasted on such a miserable movie. If at least it was flowing. But it is so boring! Thank God for fast forward. The only reason why I did not give it one star is because of Tony Jaa.
3,Another Movie I'm Drawn On...,"I can't give this a 5. I am a person who is interested in movie plots, and the plot for this movie was ridiculous! All of this over a elephant? LMAO. That's all I could think as I watched this. And while the action was pretty good, I think this movie went overboard with it. This movie was one long fight scene to me. You mean to tell me one person can take on 30 people AT ONE TIME and barely be harmed?!?! And also, after fighting and beating about 80 people he was almost beaten by one woman?!!? I know this is meant to be an action film which is why I'm not too harsh on the weak plot, but even the action was a little too much."
2,Stupid Martial Arts Movie - Still love Tony Jaa,"This was movie was so ridiculous, I'm not even sure where to start. I was a HUGE fan of the ""Thai Warrior"" movie, and was really excited to get this. This was bad, and I mean really bad. If you like Tony Jaa, don't bother.In the first place, he loses his elephant. Now, I don't mean it runs away or anything. I mean, it's STANDING NEXT TO HIM at a martial arts show, and it wanders off on it's own. It's made even more ridiculous by the fact that he JUST BOUGHT a bell for it and had just hung it around it's neck.Tony Jaa is amazing, I mean just amazing. But this movie just seems like set-ups for his aerial work, and some fighting. My friends and I laughed all the way through this, but it's a wearying effort even then. Pass this one up for sure"
2,Review.,"VERY dissapointed. This movie sucked. All the hype about Tony Jaa doesn't show through in this movie. The story line was bad. The only fight sequence worth seeing is near the end when Tony Jaa is fighting this ""Man Mountain"". But for the price, it's not worth it. If gotta see this, RedBox this movie. At least the dissapointment in this movie won't be nowhere near as bad when your only spending $1.00 to watch it."
2,"GEEZ, Where Do I Start?","As you can tell, I was very disappointed with this movie. I REALLY like fighting movies and the previews looked great... but I think I know why I didn't like the movie. It really seems like they shot 2 hours and 30 minutes of film and then took out all the plot footage, leaving only poorly arranged fight scenes with little to no segway between them. The movie just didn't make sense.I will, however, admit that the fight scenes were good and there was lots of arm and leg breakage, etc, which I like. Just don't buy this movie thinking you're getting a movie of the quality of Jet Li's Fearless, as it is FAAAAARRRR from it."
4,"5 stars for action, less for plot...","I have to agree with others that it depends on how you look at this film. I love the none stop action and fight scenes, although it may be unrealistic in real life, the action is quite entertaining and the skills are out of this world. Considering the budget of the film, I personally enjoyed it. 5 stars for the action, 3 to 2 stars for the plot/story, etc. I have only watched disc 1, so watching disk 2 may give me some insight to the story. This makes a great addition to any martial arts collection..."
3,Not exactly what I wanted,"When I received the movie, I was disappointed to find there was only one disk. Luckily it was the movie."
4,Tony Jaa will amaze you with his martial arts,"If you are into martial arts, definitely get this one as Tony Jaa is unbelieveable in his discipline. It's the usual story of kidnapping and revenge typical of martial art films. For me, the only reason to get this movie is to witness Tony Jaa doing his thing."
5,Great Action Movie!!,exciting from start to finish! a must for martial arts fans! great addition to my collection.thanks amazon! kodiak412
5,Incredible cd,"Absolutely wonderful. I like Lisa Gerrard a lot, but this adds a haunting peaceful Navaho type sound wthoout being excessive in drumming. It is a wonderful moving soft cd. Will buy more copies for gifts."
2,Disappointed,"A Thousand Roads, Lisa Gerrard.Track 18 features the marching song of the ""Fighting 69th"" regiment in the background...what's up with that??? Sounded like mockery to me. I'd like to sell the CD. Waste of my bucks."
2,Uninteresting,"Like another reviewer stated, it sounds corny and fake. I must agree. Some of it is ok, but it sounds like commercialized North American Indian music, which I suppose it is."
4,Confused by Album Credits,"Most of this album is a compilation of previously written and recorded American Indian songs with the addition of original works by the producers of the album. The credtis would lead you to believe that all songs are performed by the Slovak Symphony Orchestra. This is not the case. For example, at least three are not only composed by their original artists, but ""performed"" by their original composers as well i.e., Shaman's Call (R. Carlos Nakai), Mahk Jchi (Ulali), and All My Relations (Ulali). These are the original recordings by these artists and appear on this album as they appear on their own albums.I applaud Lisa & Jeff for their efforts to bring these culturally rich recordings to the mainstream, however, please give credit where credit is due."
4,very relaxing,"i heard two cuts from this album on a recent 'music from the hearts of space' broadcast last december. needless to say, lisa gerrard's vocals, and here combined with various indigenous north american arrangements, are stellar. i recommend this for those who are looking for ambient sounds to wind the day down. a subtle, powerful, modern collection of soundtrack compositions that is rooted in tradition. quite nice and i do plan on catching the short film next time i'm in DC."
2,Make A Good Weapon,"We've had this in our kitchen for several years now, but avoid using it if at all possible. It's extremely heavy and the handle is shaped so as to make it nearly impossible to prop between your ear and your shoulder. Dialing is a bit slow because of the placement of the numbers. All in all, I guess if a burglar came into my house at the exact same time I was using this phone, I would feel safer because it's weight at the end of the cord could act like an ancient mace and knock the intruder out. An excellent weapon I think."
3,a lil disappointed,"I specifically bought THIS phone because i thought the cradle for the handset was metal. I needed something strong and sturdy, but its not metal. ugh! The sound is good tho, rest of the phone is good. And the color choice is too limited."
4,Crosley 50s style wall phone,"Phone looks great, did a special backboard mounting ""old school"" telephone man trick. Forgot how wrinkled handset cords are, hopefuly it will relax with time. Sure takes me back which is why I ordered it. The black is a matt finished which is even nicer looking than the old gloss black phones I used to install. My wife who is quite a bit younger, is just puzzled. She stares at it like it's some sort of hand cranked washing tub. I like it ! thanks"
2,Worked for One (1) week,"The Crosley 302 wall Phone CR-55 Black, looks great in our kitchen. Unfortuately, it only worked well for One (1) week. When people called we would answer the telephone, but the callers could not hear us talking. I'm returning the phone and my wife wife wants me to return the defected one and purcahse another one. I have to say Amazon, was very helpful with the return and apologetic about the Telephone. I will pruchase another one and let the readers know the results in a few months!"
5,Amazing Retro Look,Perfect look for my 100 year old house. Ring tone brings me back to my childhood. I highly recommend this phone.
3,misrepresentation,Dear concerned.We purchased crosley 302 red wall phone along with 12 foot extra cord which was for sale on same page. At checkout it stated most people ordered that to go with phone. We received both items but cord will not work becauseshort cord on receiver is permanently affixed. Phone works fine just have to use short receiver cord.Thanks
2,Retro phone unable to get replacement parts from mfg,Loved the phone the minute I saw it. It was perfect for my new kitchen... but my calls kept getting cut off. I contacted the mfg several times for a replacement receiver and never got a return email or call. I proceeded to contact Amazon and they issued me a 1 time exception return because the mfg has not gotten back to me. I'm now looking for the same retro look but from another company.
2,Annoying line noise is a chronic problem with this phone,"Suffice it to say that I bought this phone after reading the reviews warning me about line noise, and after about one month, our headset started buzzing. You can use the phone, but it sounds terrible. Looks great on the wall, though. Too bad I can't find a similar red phone elsewhere."
5,None Made Better,"Excellent Product! You just can't buy a phone like this any more. I got sick and tired of light-weight plastic phones that fall apart too quickly. When I saw there was a company that still made a heavy duty phone that lasts,I jumped on it. We've been very pleased! We would hightly recommend this phone to anyone that is willing to sacrifice the flashy electronic options (caller i.d., speed dial, etc) for a phone that is as durable as anything made. The apple-red color looks good on our kitchen wall too!"
1,Feels cheap,The phone left a lot cheaper in reality than what it looked like in the photo. The polished metal is mostly plastic. I had hoped to find a Pottery Barn style phone and instead I found one that I am somewhat embarrassed to hang up.
3,Crosley wall phone,"Have not been able to get phone to work properly...has a 'buzz' in the line and by the time I had it installed, it was too late to return, according to paperwork."
1,Cheap Phone,I was not very pleased with the phone it seem to be very cheap plastic did not secure to the wall very well and the design of the receiver is just well stupid. You can not hold the phone against your shoulder and talk without hands because the receiver is to narrow. I'm looking for a replacement phone already.
3,Really cool looking phone but.......,"I just love this phone. It's an ""old school"" classic with the basic features intact. However, be advised you cannot dial cellular numbers only land lines. There was no indication of this limitation when I reviewed and subsequently ordered the phone. It's no big deal for me as I have my digital phone and answering machine in the back of the house and I just needed a phone to receive calls in my kitchen and answer the lobby phone. Other than that, it really is a good looking vintage telephone."
1,Builders' Depot Horrible,"Builders' Depot sent my purchase to the wrong address and they wanted me to wait for reimbursement for their mistake. They even wanted UPS to take responsibility for their error which is inexcusable. It was only when I vehemently complained that they agreed to credit my charge account. Time will only tell if they actually did that when I receive my monthly statement. After weeks of this, I still don't have a phone and have to start the process of finding one again. These people were totally unprofessional."
1,don't buy this if you have dogs,"my dog chewed the cord in two and now we cannot take the cord that is attached to the phone off, or even find a replacement for the hand set. piece of junk. you would have to buy the whole phone."
3,Style over function,"Great looking phone, but sound quality not so great. Also, very difficult to cradle in shoulder, to use hands free, due to design/weight."
2,eh,"This phone looks like the phone my grandmother had, as well as my mother had when I was a kid.... I wanted that phone to hang in my house.... however its NOTHING like the original, at all. Its push button, but shaped like a rotary phone, so as I tried to call out, my fingers fumbled- I can text on my iphone with my eyes closed- so I should not have trouble with this! Second the hand piece is irregularly shaped, nothing like the old version, its very hard too. The ring sounds like a bicycle ""cling-cling, cling-cling"" not like the original. The cord is short, and that is about the only thing that is similar to the old phone- however I remember being able to disconnect the cord and replace it with a longer one, this does not allow that- so when you are looking at this phone, even though a suggested addition to your purchase is a longer cord, it will be useless because this cord is fixed."
4,Caveat,Product is as advertised......the caveat being the cord to the handset can't be replaced with a longer one. It's molded into the handset. Bummer.
2,Buy it for show not for use,"This phone is a throw away. Ours stop working now it hangs in the kitchen just for show. If the wire was replaceable I could get the poorly made phone to work, but it's not. Don't expect this phone to be durable at all. I gave it 2 stars for it's look. The phone itself is terrible."
2,Impossible to use without hands,"I purchased this phone 3 years ago. This week the earpiece broke off, and since it was glued on rather than screwed on, it cannot be repaired.I am secretly relieved because I have despised this phone. I got the phone to hang in my kitchen, so that I could answer it while preparing dinner. The shape of the handle is that of a canoe, with the side that one would cradle between the shoulder/chin area forming a pointy edge. It was impossible to use without hands."
3,retro phone,"We needed a corded landline phone for use during power failures and thought we would go for looks. This phone does look good. However, the ring is harsh, and I'm worried that if the receiver gets dropped it will break fairly easily. I would have gladly paid more for a better quality phone if I could have found one."
5,Great Phone,Great phone. Very sturdy and I love the old time ring. Amazon came through again. I have shopped Amazon for a few years and have not been disappointed yet. They continue to amaze me on price and how fast they ship their items. When I but anything I always shop Amazon first. Great job!
1,"Package labeled 'cancer causing substance"" Buyer beware",This phone has stopped working after only eight months. I retrieved the box to find my warranty and packing materials and noticed that there was a warning on the box that I didn't notice before. It says that the manufacturer warns that there are cancer causing substances in the item. So beware of this before you place an order because no one is going to tell you.
1,DO NOT PURCHASE the suggested 12 ft cord or the detangler!,"The phone is great however, Amazon suggestions other products to go with this phone. DO NOT purchase the 12 ft. cord or the detangler. The handset is hardwired and you cannot replace the cord for a longer one. Money and shipping costs were wasted as these two items which came separately from different vendors. GRRRRR!"
2,For decoration only,"The phone is made of very cheap plastic. And the static is horrible - we have not been able to hear through it. I really do not think the phone would hold up to real use even if we were able to talk through the static. In fact the only thing it has going for it is the retro design. It looks great hanging on the wall but don't expect to really use it. If you want an expensive decoration to match your retro theme, it looks sharp. Just don't expect to really talk on it."
5,Stylish and functional,"This phone works well but looks even better. I have had this phone connected to a regular landline as well as a cable phone line (through the modem) and both worked great. Currently I don't have it hooked up to the phone line (the line was damaged... but the phone still works great) but I have it hung because I love the way it looks in my kitchen.One thing you should know is that the curled line going from the headset to the phone base is extremely long... it almost touches the floor from where it is hung. While this lets you move a good distance from the phones base while chatting it is a bit too long for my taste... unfortunately it is not removable or replaceable (at least not with standard phone cord). It still looks cool though, and we all know that is the most important thing!"
2,Doesn't dial out,"It's still on my wall and looks great. I can take incoming calls, sound quality is good, BUT it stopped dialing out about a month after I got it. I'm looking for a new phone the looks as good and actualy dials out, till then it stays on my wall."
3,Crosley 302 Wall Phone,"Its better than the earlier wall phone that we bought from Amazon. It was terrible and that's why we replaced it withvthis one, again from Amazon. We seem to get static on the line from this phone at some times. The design of the headset is such that you can't ""Cradle"" it between your shoulder and your ear, i.e. Hands free. Looks fine."
5,Exactly As Described,This phone is perfect for my kitchen. It matches my decor perfectly. I like the sound of the bell when the phone rings. The volume control for the handset works for HOH people such as my husband. It is surely an eye catcher.
2,Not up to traditional standards,"May look like a Bell Labs classic, but it's a sad imitation. After only 6 months the handset gave out. No incoming sound. Only then did I realize that the receiver is HARDWIRED. No module plug, so if the cord goes bad, the whole thing is a paperweight.It's really too bad that someone can't make a retro phone designed to last like the old Bell phones. It looked great in our 50's kitchen. But I should have known something was wrong when the ""brushed chrome"" turned out to be shiny plastic.This phone is like a Pontiac Solstice - looks great on the outside, junk in the inside. Avoid, and don't make my mistake."
2,Crosley Phone looks ok but not practical.,"This phone looks fine but the sound quality is terrible, it echoes. The handset is to large, you can't cradle it in your neck. The volume adjust is behind the phone, so you have to take it off the wall to adjust it. Not a very practical phone at all."
2,The cord is not long enough,"The phone itself is of high quality with good voice tone and a familiar 1960ish ring. The main problem I have is that it is not a modular cord attached but one that is permanently attached and cannot be replaced by the consumer. I cannot figure out how this will be accomplished when the cord goes bad and they all go bad. I guess one will have to send it back to the company. I wish someone had written about this when I read the reviews, I would not have purshased it."
2,Great Phone... For A While,"I LOVE this phone... it looks great, it rings just like the old-fashioned phones, and works great FOR AWHILE. I'm on my 4th phone (yes, I'm an idiot, I keep re-buying the same phone again and again... it's about the only one like this on the market) and the exact same thing has happened with every phone. It works great for about 2 months and then one day suddenly the buttons stop working. It can still receive calls, but you can't call out since you can't dial. At first I thought it was a fluke, but all four phones I've purchased have done the exact same thing."
1,Beautiful but hummy,"Since the day I hung this beautiful phone on the wall I've being dealing with a HuMMMMMM sound on the line.I tried taking the phone to another house but still I have the HUMMMMM sound.Consider your buy because I've had a bad experience with mine.I even call the telephone company and they came to my house in order to check the line, and told me the problem as on the phone."
1,Reliability and Features are Lacking,"We've had this phone for about two years now.It worked well until about two months ago, when we noticed a pronounced hum/buzz when using this phone. When using the other house phones, the hum/buzz is not present. Seems like an uncomplicated thing like a phone should last for life... like the real phones of yesteryear did.One other thing to consider: this is not a rotary dial phone. It has a circular array of push buttons for number entry. It's not a bad thing, just not what you might expect in a retro phone, and the product photo doesn't reveal this fact too well.Oh, one other thing: The cord is not replaceable as is the case with most ""modern"" corded phones. In this phone, the cord is a part of the handset; there is no disconnect for it.One last thing: the ""redial"" function on the phone has not worked since we received it. It didn't annoy me enough to return it, but thought I'd include the information here."
3,"Cute, but not necessarily convenient","Gone are the habits of rotary dialing -- adjusting to the rotary (push button) style of this phone has frustrated the family. The keys don't light up making it impossible to dial without turning on the lights. Note to self: use the cordless phone in an emergency. This phone opposes multi-tasking -- the design and weight make gripping the receiver between your ear and shoulder a joke. That said, it looks nice and fits in well with the stainless appliances in our kitchen. It's a sacrifice of utility for style."
5,Very Happy,"I got this phone for my wife as she is redecorating our house and she couldn't be happier! I was worried about quality as I have read the reviews, but it is working perfect and sounds great. It sounded bad at first but I remembered to put a DSL filter on and it cleared right up. The only problem was with Amazon once again not putting a gift note in the package but thats small stuff. It looks great on the wall and does exactly what we wanted."
4,retro phone fun!,"This retro phone in chrome was exactly what I was looking for. My older home has a spot for a 'wall phone'...any new wireless phone I attempted did not cover up the phone wall plate. So since I have a retro diner feel in my kitchen...I started looking for something funky. This phone works just fine, looks amazing and covers the spot...and the best thing, I got my plug back as this is just a standard phone jack phone - no need for electricity. I still have my wireless in another spot in the home...don't know if I'd enjoy being tethered to the wall, but for an 'accent' phone, this is awesome."
4,Great second time around,I ordered the Crosley 302 Wall Phone in Brushed Chrome and it looked great but it was defective. I was able to return it very easily at no cost to myself and received a new one very promptly. This second one works great and it looks wonderful on my kitchen wall. It is sharp looking and fun to use.
1,Unable to dial out,"For $55 I would expect the product to last more than 6 months. We are unable to use the keypad to dial out, although we can receive incoming calls. Buyer beware."
1,looks can be deceiving,"great looks, poor quality -phone does not sit flush on the wall so it tilts when you push down on the buttons. Push buttons stopped working after a month."
3,Looks nice; sounds good; feels cheap,"I was replacing a similar looking but overpriced item from Pottery Barn and found this. The price is better and it looks nice. The phone audio is very good. While the handle has a nice feel to it, the body just feels cheap and the ringer is anemic. Still, it does the job and it definitely looks good on the wall."
3,Hard to find a red wall phone,"I really had a difficult time locating a red wall phone. This one is ok at best. The handset is very heavy & not designed to ""lean on your shoulder"" while doing other things. I've also had a problem with a ""humming"" sound while talking on it. Other phones do not do this in the same jack."
3,Good but could be better,"The phone is well built and easy to install on the wall. However the handset is very heavy, something that the product description doesn't mention. As a result, it's uncomfortable to use if you're on the phone for any period of time."
1,"Looks good, but is useless","Sorry, no option for ZERO starsMy wife loved the way this phone looked. I liked the retro look to it as well (I grew up in a rural area with a rotary phone and the old style party line). I could not even hang the phone on the wall because it had the wrong mount for US wall mounts (RJ11C modular). It had 4 inch mounts. Standard US phones are 3 1/4 inches. I guess the mounts in China (where these phones are made) are 4 inches. Back to the drawing board, Chinese engineers!!Looks: 5 starsFunction: negative 5 starsOverall quality: useless"
3,Retro look corded phone,This is the second one I purchased. Last year bought this same one and broke when the wall part fell. Only purchased again for the look. Amazon has a good price.
2,How much....?,"It is cute, but it is no where near what they are asking for it. It is very, very cheaply constructed. It would only be worth it at half the price. The phone cord being advertized with it will NOT work, so don't bother to buy it. The cord is not removable from the hand set."
3,Nostalgic phone,"This phone looks great and the ring tone is awesome! However, the connection when you are talking on it is extremely fuzzy."
3,Made with a lot of plastic.,"It was nice, but I returned it. The negative-it felt like a toy phone also my husband didn't like the matte black finish."
1,Constant buzzing in phone,"I bought this phone for my sisters new home. She now cannot use it because there is a constant buzzing sound. Can barely hear the person on the other end because of the buzzing. Now, its too late to return so she is stuck with a phone that doesnt work. ugh what to do????"
2,"Nice, but . . .","I bought this phone to add a bit of charm to my kitchen. It has a good ring and looks nice. Problems I have are two:1. The handset is not suitable to use your shoulder to hold it to your ear while you use both hands to do something. The handset is not flat on the back but has a triangular shape, so it slips off the shoulder quite readily.2. The cord is not modular on the handset and a wire broke inside within 1 month of owning it. This made the phone useless. All I can use it for now is to ring.Bad choice of wiring design, modular on both ends would have been a better choice."
1,Good looks don't cut it....,"It looks great on the wall, but the sound is terrible, fuzzy and buzzy. This is my second Crosley wall phone (the first is about 4 years old). The sound quality of the first one is also poor, so I thought I would replace it and get some improvement.WRONG! I'll keep the second one as a ""back-up"" in case the first one is ever ripped off...as I feel I have been."
3,Does NOT Attach to The Telephone Wall Mount Plate,"The telephone can be mounted on the wall using the enclosed screws, but the telephone is NOT designed for attachment to the wall jack plate provided by the telephone company. Even if you mount the phone to the wall using the screws, the phone does not cover the wall jack plate. Nothing wrong with the phone, but it is important to understand the difference between a phone that can be mounted on the wall, and a phone that will attach the existing wall mounted jack plate."
4,Beautiful...,"This is a really nice telephone that adds character to your kitchen. Although, I hate the ringer (which can be turned off) I'm glad I purchased it. I brought it for the style so the ringer does not bother me. I received a lot of complements from family and friends."
4,Just Ok,"The color of this phone is a lovely deep red, very classic, much like the one my parents had when I was a kid. The form is good and hangs easily but you can not hold it with your shoulder if you want to multitask. The clarity is not that good, even with the volume up, it sounds like the other person is far away and sometimes there is interference that I never get on my other phones. Nevertheless, it is not my primary phone and I do love the way it looks in my hallway."
4,Great phone. Coiled handset cord is plenty long. No electric plug needed.,"Great looking phone. Of course, the plastic isn't the heavy duty stuff that phones in the 50s and 60s were made of, but it's plenty sturdy and looks good on the wall. No unsightly electric cords to plug in, just runs on power from the wall phone jack! There's no need to buy the additional 12 foot cord, if you're considering it. The original cord seems just as long as the extra 12 foot cord I bought. I like this phone!"
2,Great look but poor phone quality,"I bought this phone because I thought it would look perfect in our white and red kitchen. It did. Unfortunately, the quality of the phone itself left a lot to be desired. There was an annoying fuzzy hum sound on it almost from day one. We thought it was our internet service because we signed up for DSL just before purchasing it. We had no problem with any of the other phones in the home, however. After about 9 months, the hum turned into a static and eventually the phone only worked periodically. We ended up taking it down and having to purchase a new phone. Too bad, really. It looked really cool on the wall!"
3,Cannot add longer cord,I love the look of this phone. It fits in perfectly with my 200 year old house. BUT for a kitchen phone I always change over to a 25 foot cord and you CANNOT on this phone. The cord is hardwired to the handset. It is very misleading because Amazon suggests a longer cord when you look at this item and it also shows that customers who bought this phone also bought longer cords.
3,"Needed a corded 'land' line, but doesn't last","Our power goes out quite often so having a corded land line is a must - to call in the outage! This one looks great with SS room accents. Have gotten many positive comments on its looks. Unfortunately the push buttons quit working so all we can do now is answer it. So much for calling in our outage! 4 stars for looks, 2 stars for functionality = 3 stars."
1,Worst use of phone,"At first glance,I loved the phone, it's long handle on the headset feltright at home. It has a polished grace to it.The first few times the phone worked great, then... it started cutting out..The people calling could hear us...but we couldn't hear them.. were we gettingBLOCKED?! No just couldn't hear them, other phones worked fine in the house so--it was just this phone. Nnnnnnnnnnnever! know when we won't be able to hear. Nota god deal when Half of the fun of a phone call is to HEAR!! the in coming voice.Would Love to have this phone hanging on the wall in my kitchen with my other Chromeappliances, but it NEEDS to work!"
3,it works... and that's about all we have to say!,"The phone clicks and rings whenever you pick up another extension in the house. It is very difficult to dial, we are spoiled with rowed buttons on ever other phone.It is cool looking, it is a phone....it is nothing special and not worth the high cost in our opinions."
3,Works~~~ but Make sure you have Time!,"This is a wonderful product when traveling; however, you must PLAN a head. Say for example: you feed your baby every 3hours, to avoid frustration; you need to activate the bottle warmer 25-30mins before, in order to have it ready for the baby. If you warm it right when the baby needs it, you're going to have them fussing and crying for at least 20min before you can feed. Now that is frustrating... Remember---this product is conducive for traveling, however, you need to activate it 25-30min before every feeding... Hope this helps!"
4,It works but takes some time,My baby is 5 weeks old so all she needs is 3-4 oz at a time. I used this item today for the first time and was not disapointed. It took ~15 minutes to warm the bottle. I read the instructions before using it so I was prepared and turned it on ahead of time. Very useful item if you travel a lot. would recommend!
4,It serves it's purpose,"Now, I was told that it's best not to heat baby's bottles too warm during the day because they will have a harder time accepting a ""cooler"" bottle. So with that said know that I only heat my little one's bottles long enough to take away the chill or just slightly warmer.I think this serves my needs very well. It does take some time if you really want the bottle warm, but about 5-10 minutes seems to be enough for us. We just took a 4 hour trip and at that point I had enough time to heat up her bottles a little warmer. If you are like me and just need to take away the chill or make it about room temp then this is worth the money."
4,If You Travel A Lot-You Should Have One,"If you are planning even one long trip with your new little one, you'll be glad you have this, but try it out before you go. It does take a long time to warm up a bottle with this, so you do have to anticipate the need for a bottle. The smaller the bottle, the faster the formula will warm up. It's a good idea to try it out before you travel so you know how long it will take. One use will pay for itself!"
2,Only worth what you paid for it.....,"May be good if your only needing to heat a smaller bottle like a 4oz. but be prepared to start heating it up at least 20-30 minutes prior to ""feeding"" time and not when you have a screaming fussy baby waiting. Also the warmer mechanism ONLY wraps around the bottle and does NOT have anything that warms the bottom of the bottle so you will have to be sure to shake around the bottle during the warming process to ensure the milk gets warm enough. I would not waste my time trying to use this each time even though I know the tricks of it. I'm currently researching for another brand of travel warmer and this time will spend a little more for something decent and would never recommend this to anyone even for a quick fix! Just NOT! worth the hassle...."
1,Don't bother,"My husband and i are always on the run and we thought something like this would be perfect. It says it's fast at heating them up but once we used it, it took almost 30 minutes! On top of that it has a saftey switch on the bottom so it knows when the bottle is it. Well since the button is so far down compared to the heat band, the lower section of the bottle does not get heated. It took so long and i rather of spent a few more dollars to get something that really worked."
1,Waste of time and money,We bought this product last week because our daughter was finally allowed to go out in public. We thought this would be convenient for us when we travel out of town next month. Unfortunately this isn't working out. The first time we used it we used it on a 5 oz. bottle. It said it would warm up in 15 minutes but to check it every 5 minutes and shake. I did that and when 15 minutes was up the band at the top only warmed up therefore not warming the bottle at all. I had to give the bottle to my baby real cold. The next time I used it I figured it would work better with a 6 oz bottle since it was taller and rounder. Also I didn't take the bottle out every 5 minutes instead I shook it every 5 minutes. When 15 minutes was up the bottle was hot at the top but again milk was cold. It goes back tomorrow. What a waste!
2,We have made it work but.......,"The idea is great, the product is not so great. We have the same reviews as everyone else. The bottles (we use VentAir) do not touch the ""on"" sensor, and it takes more than 30 minutes to warm our 8 oz bottles. Our son will not take them luke warm, he likes them very warm.How we made it work for us:Clothes pin that we just clip on over the sensor to turn the warmer on.And one hour before our son's feeding time we start warming the bottle.Very slow process, I wish I would have done more research upon buying this warmer."
2,"works, but takes much longer than 15 minutes",i got this warmer as a gift. the travel warmer concept is perfect for us because we travel alot. but the warmer takes much longer than 15 minutes to warm a bottle. my daughter eats 5.5 oz and after 30 minutes of warming it was only very luke warm. my suggestion is test this product with different times to see how long it will take you to get the water/formula warmed to the temp your child likes. that will allow you to start warming before the child is upset.
1,Terrible,"This is the worst thing I've ever bought. It literally takes me 30-40 minutes to warm the bottle to just below room temperature (still pretty cool), meanwhile my daughter is screaming out of hunger in the background. I should get paid for using something so crappy."
1,Warms bottle in MINUTES is TOO vague!,"I recall the packaging saying it could take up to 15 minutes, but when my husband and I go on long car rides, we have to anticpate our daughters hunger at least 45 minutes in advance to get the bottle to a temperature where she'll actually eat it! It says not to leave it plugged in too long as well, and I wonder if we're using it for ""too long"" to get the bottle to the heat that it needs to be at! I wouldn't recommend this product, but see it as a necissary evil for long car trips, just so the bottle can be warmed without having to pull into a gas station that may have a microwave! (Those can sometimes be scarier than waiting FOREVER until the bottle gets warm!)"
3,Do you know who I am?,"A bitter, cynical, very profane, often funny, occasionally moving film about a lower middle class young man, Dean (Matthew Leitch), determined to escape from what he views as his dead-end life by pretending to be the son of an aristocratic Englishwoman. He gains access to the rarefied world of the rich and titled only to find it hollow, filled with cruel, shallow people. The social-climbing Dean both uses and is in turn used by the people he wants to emulate.The characters are unlovable, with the unlikely exceptions of an aging homosexual who takes a somewhat fatherly interest in Dean, and an unstable American hustler who tries and ultimately fails to bond with him.Not a particularly likeable film, it nonetheless raises valid issues on the subject of class distinction and the group of people who think the question ""Do you know who I am?"" is sufficient to excuse any kind of aberrant behavior."
5,An excelent piece of art,"After seeing this movie, I instantly added it in my TOP 10 favorite movies of all times. If you are NOT into Hollywood junk, you definitely should not miss this one. The 3-screen cinematography is superb, giving you the sensation that you are actually there, but nobody is able to see you or interact with you, just like in the movie Russian Ark. This movie is remarkably well done. It is a MUST see for all of you cineastes out there."
4,Good,Very good snack. Very tasty and fresh. Only disappointed is the size of one serving (one bag) is very small and I am a small person that usually gets filled up quickly.
5,A favorite in our family!,These cashew snacks have a special flavor that we have not found in any other product. We keep coming back for more because they taste so good and are good for you too!
5,Satechi MA-D Shutter Remote,"Works great with my Panasonic FZ100. This is the one to get!! I bought two other remotes and they were both junk. The Satechi works great and has a good, solid feel. Unlike other remotes, the pre-focus point (half-way depressed) is easy to detect by feel. Great product! Thank you, Satechi."
4,Great value,Inexpensive and perfectly functional wired remote. I buy two at a time because I am hard on these things and usually end up damaging them before I wear them out (once I let one hang outside my car door and dragged it on the pavement and through mud puddles!) but this would be just as true for the more expensive ones that the camera manufacturer sells. So don't expect it to last forever but at about 1/5 the cost of the name brand unit you can afford to buy several.
5,Nice and sharp!,"Like the other reviewers, I noticed the heads of these pins were smaller than my old pins. That's not all bad though as they are a little less noticeable. Very sharp and the 5/8"" length is super at attaching the ""remember to check your fly!"" note to your husband's forehead as he's leaving for work."
4,Cute Gift,"I got this for a secret santa gift and for my mom. I think both are really going to like setting up their ""day at the beach"" and looking at it as they sit at their desks. To me, this seems like a really fun gift and I'm very excited to have it unwrapped :]"
1,Don't Buy From This Supplier,"I purchased this item and when I did the initial search, I put in LaserJet 4MPlus. What came up was 4Mp.The vendor claims it is not returnable as all sales are final but it said nothing about that.DO NOT BUY FROM THIS VENDOR THEY ARE A RIP OFF!"
1,Not compatible at all,Smeared toner over all copies from the beginning. I have had the 4P since 1995 and at this point I am beginning to be a little protective.
3,7 / 10,"A decent read. Though I enjoyed much of her story, and admired her crusade, I admittedly tired of the many letters written to her that she included. So the way that it was written did make for an eye sore at times, however this does not diminish her own story or who she was, her great struggles, and her steadfast beliefs in what she stood for."
4,Informative,"This book has a lot of useful information. I didn't use it much during my pregnancy because I already knew which doctor and hospital I was going to use, and I'm not really one for prenatal yoga / massage / etc.I just picked up the book again recently (the baby is 5 months old, it's kind of been a blur before now anyway) and there are so many cool things listed that I want to do. It lists all types of classes for the baby, restaurants that are baby/kid friendly, parks, stores and thrift stores, and just about any other resource you might need.Some of the website addresses are incorrect, but the business names are correct so you can just google it."
1,REMANUFACTURED DELL-JUST DIDNT WORK BAD PURCHASE,"I PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT EXPECTING TO USE IT FOR BASIC TYPING AND INTERNET SURFING. I RECIEVED THE PRODUCT ABOUT 5 DAYS AFTER DELIVERY DATE. I THEN PLUGGED IT UP EXCITED TO SEE WHAT I PURCHASED. I GOT ERROR MESSAGE. I SENT AN EMAIL 2X TO THE COMPANY. I FINALLY RECIEVED A REPLY EMAIL. HOWEVER, I THEN WAS SENT A NEW HARD DRIVE. IT WAS NOT THE HARD DRIVE IT IS A BAD AND OLD MOTHER BOARD THAT CANNOT BE FOUND. I TOOK THE COMPUTER TO SEVERAL PLACES OFFICE DEPOT, CIRCUIT CITY , AND STAPLES AND AFTER SPENDING ALL OF THE EXTRA MONEY. I WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER OFF BUYING ON NEW. I PAID FOR A PRODUCT THAT I NEVER GOT AND NEVER WILL BE ABLE TO USE. THE COMPANY DIDNT CARE ABOUT THE COMPUTER NOT WORKING BECAUSE WHEN THEY SHIPPED IT IT WORKED. DONT GO CHEAP BECAUSE IN THE LONG RUN YOULL PAY FOR IT."
4,Keeps the kids interested,"The stories arent short and my children stay to hear it. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because I do not like the way the son addresses his father when he speaks to him, and I still havent quite figured out what to substitute instead of reading it word for word during those moments in the book (which happen often). For now, we just talk about how he speaks isnt very nice and its not acceptable in our house hold, which may be sufficient :)."
3,Good start to a new series.,"In some ways, this will remind you of the Janet Evanovich books. It's raunchy, funny and character driven. Samantha runs a dating service (her mother would like her to be a real estate agent). She had to sell her house after her husband died so now she and her 2 boys live with her retired magician grandfather. I have a feeling he's going to be one of the real fun characters in future books.But back to this one-- It turns out that Sam's husband was running an illegal drug business and was murdered (by chocolate brownie). Now someone wants the half a million dollars he took. They give Sam until Friday to come up with the money.Add to the mix, 2 very different and attractive men who prove to be a distraction, a probem with clothes and some ""soccer moms"" who want Sam to solve an embarrassing problem. Sam definitely has her hands full.I'm looking forward to the next one."
4,Wonderful!!,This movie is absolutely fantastic! It really emphasises the writing talent of Jules Verne while still keeping the story factual and appropiate for younger viewers. An all around great!
5,Curious Kids Indeed!,My two and a half year old daughter LOVES this book! We've borrowed it from the library so many times I've lost count. I like the artwork and the colors and how simple the text and pictures are. This book is asked for over and over again and she wants to take it everywhere. Great book!
3,Same Findings,"I bought this watch 3 weeks ago and have come to the very same conclusion that the other reviewer has. The watch is stunningly beautiful and I always get a ton of compliments on it because it looks like nothing else out there. However, there is a design flaw in the clasp that is more annoying than a watch of this price should accomodate. When you bend your wrist downwards, it pops the clasp, releasing the watch to dangle on your wrist. I probably have to re-clasp it once or twice a day. This is totally unacceptable and I think they should offer a free recall to anybody who has ever purchased this watch. I'd be willing to bet most people would like to keep the watch rather than return it...if they could only get the clasp repaired."
2,extremely poor clasp design,"this is one beautiful watch! it looks better in person than it does in pictures. unfortunately the poor clasp design does not stay closed. i am an average size person, and with ordinary hand and wrist motions the clasp will repeatedly open. there wasn't any mechanical defect with the watch i received, and i tried adding and removing links. when you bend your wrist the release buttons are right in the fold between your palm and wrist. if i were only wearing this watch on special occassions i guess i could deal with it, but not on a daily basis. i'm sending mine back,i can't use it. it's too bad, i really liked it."
3,desktop golf game,"It's alright, not exactly what i was expecting but hey, it was a $9 stocking stuffer so yeah.. it's basically a desk ornament for the golf enthusiast."
1,Silk Flowers,Product was more plastic type dots then silk flowers. Looked really FAKE and the dots droped off when touched or jossled.
2,Won't work on small helis,"The description says the guage ""fits all helis"", yet it at its ""narrowest"" setting, it's about 35mm (1 7/16"" inches) wide. If you have a 200/250 heli, you need a smaller unit. Might not even fit a 450 class. Measure your blade width and make sure it's larger than the above measurements. May even want to play it safe and stay above 40mm (1 5/8 inches) as the spring tension is pretty weak at first."
4,good fit,"thermostat fit inside, it has the little alignment notch, and no leaks! can't ask for more than that, i guess."
1,"Good Idea, Baby hates it","My son kept spitting out this pacifier with a look of disgust. This morning, I decided to investigate. I put it in my mouth and quickly discovered his issue. First off, I have washed this several times and it still tastes like horrible plastic. Second, the shape is much too large for an infant's mouth... too large for my mouth. The curvature of the mouth piece is unnatural and hard to handle. I understand why he doesn't like this and won't use it again. Plus, it gave inaccurate readings for us both. It's too bad because this is a really good idea."
3,I Only Recommend Half this Product,"I should've gone with my gut on this purchase and not bought it. Intinctively something told me giving medicine through what is a soothing and comforting item for my daughter was wrong. She loves her sassie and so the first time I tried to put tylenol in the midicine dispenser she freaked out. And then refused her real sassie. Beware with this method of medicating.I do, however, love the pacifier thermometer. It is sooo easy to use! My daugher doesn't even realize anything is different and I'm getting the information I need, fast & easy.If you have a choice, find just a pacifier thermometer and skip the medicine dispenser."
1,no good!,"doesnt give accurate readings and works for the first, i say 2-3 times, but then it doesnt work anymore!"
2,Nice idea but...,Don't waste your money on any Pacifier Thermometers. My baby use to gag on it because it is much larger than a newborn pacifier and now that he is dosen't leave it in his mouth long enough (4 minutes) for it to calculate his temperature. Who has time for this aggravation with a sick baby.
1,Don't waste your money,"Your pediatrician or the nurse you call in the middle of the night will not accept a reading from one of these -- they will ask you for a rectal temperature reading during your baby's first year, so it's best to get a basic digital thermometor (not an ear thermometor) and save your $$$."
2,A good idea but...,I bought this for my daughter because I thought it was a good idea but she was a thumb sucker so when I tried to put it in her mouth she would spit it out and put her thumb back in. so I really couldn't use it. The pediatrician told me she wouldn't accept that reading anyway because a rectal temperature is more accurate. My daughter wouldn't take medicine from the medicine pacifier either. Good idea but I wouldn't buy it if your baby is a thumb sucker.
3,Pacifier Thermometer and Medi-Dispencer,Well I love the thermometer pacifier but I'm not to happy with the medi-dispencer. The medi-dispencer is very cheaply made and will barely snap close. Your better off just throwing it away!If you don't throw it away and try to use it your gonna end up with half of the medicine all over your hands before you even get it closed so you can give it to your crying child who doesnt feel well!!!! trust me! Buy the thermometer pacifier by itself and you'll be a lot happier!
1,hate it,"she can't keep it in her mouth. when i first tried it, she couldn't keep it in her mouth and i thought that if she was sick, i could just hold her and hold it in her mouth, but it doesn't work."
2,nice idea but...,the pacifier thermometer is a good idea but you can't really use it if your child won't take a pacifier. same problem with the medicine pacifier. Why would you want to use something that most kids find comforting for something most kids hate?(like medicine?)
5,A veritable bible for healng,"Adoption Healing is the ""Courage to Heal"" of adoption. Soll has written an excellent guide to healing the loss of the sacred mother/child relationship thru adoption. No more need be said. If you lost your mother thru adoption, or are affected in some other way by the losses of adoption, this book is for you."
2,Adoption Healing.... a path to recovery,"As a first mother, I was really anticipating a well written book. Instead as I read the work, all I yearned for was an editor and a good graphic designer. Do seek out his source material, like ""The Primal Wound"" or ""Lost and Found: the Adoption Experience""If you are just beginning to examine the Adoption Triad this book may be for you."
1,"Too generalized, assuming and stereotypical.","I have read several books in an attempt to resolve my own adoption issues. I found this book to be very generalized, assuming and stereotypical. This book was very frustrating for me because it ""cans"" adopted people into one type of developmental response, and doesn't offer differing perspectives. I found The Primal Wound by Nancy Newton Verrier to be a much more insightful book."
1,didn't apply to this birth mother,"this book would be fine if: 1. the birth mother buys into the premise that she had NO CHOICE when she relinquished her baby (that the birth mother was simply a total victim of society and the adoption agency); 2.the birth mother had been put in a ""wage home"" during her pregnancy; 3. you even begin to entertain the use of the ""inner child"" therapy method - none of the above applied to me (a birth mother) - also, if a birth mother and adoptee are in reunion, this book barely touches on this phase"
5,IS THAT A REAL GAME I AM WATCHING???,"Hands down the best football game out! Graphics are unbelievable. I thought there was no way the could better them from last year, but they did. Fixed the running game so that it is not so easy to run for 200 yds. a game. This has got to be the sports title of the year!! Pick it Up for only $19.99! Also, notice the back of the case as they put the image of there cover boy running over Madden's cover guy. Sublimenal message? ( I think I spelled that right)"
5,The best football game yet,"Eson football 2005 was simply the best football yet!!! I thought that it was going to suck considering that it was only $20 bucks, and was going to save my money for madden. Then i played it, and the gamesplay was awesome, the sportscenter was awesome, the half time report was awesome, and above all the graphics were awesome. I advise to everyone to get this game for it is a most have..."
4,GREAT,"this is one of the best football games i have ever playedit might actually b able 2 compete with madden this yearthe game playawesome it is fun 2 play and the dynasty mode is amazing like always and even if ur just doin a quick game it is still fun either waythe soundtrackone of the reasons i gave this 4 stars was becuz of the soundtrack it doesnt have any popular songs it is all of the same genre and it isnt really excitingnew feeaturesit still has 1st person mode which i love but it also has added more features 2 the crip- such as having a secong floor and more mini games plus, u can play against celebrities with ur phonewut i didnt likei dont like how the players still look funny wen they runlike their shoulders r shoved way out in front of their bodiesalso i think it could make running around a little smoother like in maddenthat is all i dislikedi would definately recommend this game 4 any football fan"
5,really good!,"i thought this game is REALLY good.What can i say--i think that the ratings are good, and i think the teams are good.you can make your own teams, players, create teams, and unlock players. in this game you have your own house. when u play a game, you get crib credits. crib credits are when you can buy stuff for your house.i thought this game was really good--if you like spots buy it! its worth every penny!"
5,Best gets better,This is the best video football game on the market...this year it's much improved AND it's only $20
5,Best Football Game and Only $20? Finally a Great Value!,"This is without a doubt the best football game I have played on any system. The graphics, control, sound, and everything else is perfect. I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw this newly released game for only $20. No more Madden in my future, just the ESPN 2K series from now on. Go Cowboys!"
4,Madden Is A Bit Better...,I believe that Madden is a little better then this game. This game does have great feautures that Madden doesn't have but I'd rather have Madden.I like The Crib feature but it seems to draw me away from trying to play my season but overall I like the features in The Crib.**** out of 5Season Mode is incredible. I started a season with the Pittsburgh Steelers and I'm 10-0. This is the best feature of the whole game and I love to play the season mode in all football games.***** out of 5.I'm not going to get into every little thing but overall you should pick this up but if you have Madden then don't bother. It's a good game don't get me wrong but my opinion Madden is better.
2,"just because im young doesen't mean i'm dumb, listen","This game is terrible. i would like to point out to anyone that is looking to get a game for better value then Madden 2005 that this game would have to be priced around $2.99 to have a better value. Madden has better graphics, better featurs, higher resale value, is more fun, and has a deeper franchise mode, which is what alot of people spend most of theier time doing if they can't have X-box live due to a dial-up connection."
5,"""Brandscendence"" Explores Branding","Kevin Clark has developed a deep knowledge and understanding of successful brands and shares this with the reader in Brandscendence"". He thoroughly explores the subject with an easy reading approach which will keep the reader's attention and provide a lasting reference for anyone involved or interested in the subject of branding."
3,Who still uses chalk?,"This chalk was pretty easy to use and did create less dust, but to say ""Anti-Dust"" on the packaging seems like they're stretching the truth. Also, this wasn't the most durable chalk I've ever used, but I don't use chalk very often so maybe that's just how it's made."
1,Whoa! Five dollars?,"I purchased this a while ago as a filler item for less than a dollar. As far as chalk goes, it's nothing special. Since then the price has risen exponentially. At the current price, I highly recommend against purchasing this product."
4,The Inner and Outer Journeys,"An interesting story with two levels and several good characters. On one level, Maiden Voyage is the well-paced story of a young woman's around-the-world adventure and journey from innocence to maturity.On a deeper level the story is about the universal longing for love and acceptance. Each character, male and female, longs for a love they don't have. In the beginning, their yearnings are as much for self-validation as for affection.As the novel unfolds, some characters use the journey and its lessons to distinguish between wanting love and needing love. Others, as in real life, never undersatnd that constant yearning creates more emptiness than not being loved."
5,Great music!,"Well, I first heard this band on the Teaching Mrs Tingle soundtrack(the song sorry) and I just completely loved it! I can't stop hearing this cd since I bought it. If you havent heard anything of Stretch Princess, just check out Teaching Mrs Tingle(sorry) or She's all that(sugar) you'll be amazed! Now listen the whole cd! WOW! I first wanted to only buy both teaching and shes all that soundtrack(which I think doesn't even exist since I didn't find it anywhere, not even here at amazon)because I didn't find the cd of the band here on Mexico(it was very hard to find). But I'm glad I found it. Completely! Buy it! Now!"
3,Good reference book,"This book is basically a printout of the Cisco website. However it does read a little better than some of the Cisco web pages, and it since it covers content you'll need to pass your CCIE, its a must for every candidates collection. A really helpful companion to this book is the CCIE DLSw+ quiz"
3,"Just ""meh""","Overall unimpressed with the Knock Knock Jokes in this book we bought for our niece. The good news is she likes them but as a ""grown up"" having to hear them, they seem cheesier than most Knock Knocks. Perhaps since the author tried so hard to make them Easter-related...Anyway she liked her gift and the illustrations are cute. There were a few decent jokes and it was an Easter Basket stuffer for a kid who LOVES knock knock jokes so overall a good purchase but not my favorite joke book for kids."
3,Seat covers,I recieved the order a lot quicker than expected. Seat Covers were VERY DIFFICULT to put on and the directions weren't very helpful or clear so I ended up putting them on which ever way they fit the best. They didn't fit the seats on my Ford Focus very well but after a week or so they began to stretch and fit better.
3,Rips and Runs,"I really liked the product because it matched the floor mats and wheel cover I recv'd as a birthday gift, however the driver side seat cover had a small tear on it when I recieved it where the sewing machine didn't catch both pieces of fabric. It was no big deal to me at first because I was happy to have my new car decked out with my fairy stuff. After about three weeks of driving my 5 mile round trip to work every day the seam where the back meets the seat now has several runs in it which really makes me upset. The seam just wasn't sewn correctly and I have a pretty bad looking seat cover."
3,seat cover,"seat cover has a nice picture, soft fabric, I love this one except for the fact that in due time the sun fades the black area to where it has a reddish tint."
4,Fairy seat covers,"These seat covers were quite good for the low price. Unfortunately they don't fit the shape of the headrests in our car, but I think I can modify them without too much trouble to fit better. Don't expect high quality embroidery or fabric -- remember you get what you pay for -- but the printed pictures are pretty, and I'm sure these covers will last for a while, anyway!"
2,Works for me!,"I have a Mitsubishi Montero, and the seat covers fit quite well over the headrests. Easy to install. The quality is not the highest, but neither is the price. Allow a little slack in the seat, as these will probably split if the fit is snug. Again, they fit a Montero well. Would recommend them."
4,Faeries,They do look beautiful in my car but I wish they fit better. It's hard to get them around the electronics on the side of the seat
4,Holy Bananas!,"Let me be up front and say that The Bloody Ape is probably the worst looking movie I've ever seen. It looks like it cost only $100.00 to make. And the sound is atrocious for about half of the runtime. Still, it has plenty of charm and is often funny. The funniest scene for me was when the ape steals a car and drives it, running someone over. Who taught this ape how to drive? And whenever the two cops are onscreen (including one with an affection for donuts and coffee) the movie is pure gold. The cops chemistry and dialogue reminded me of the cops in Blood Feast 2: All U Can Eat. So, The Bloody Ape is far from perfect. And I can't even call it ""good"" per se. It's a bad movie, but it is entertaining enough for me to recommend to fans of low-budget horror and cheesy b-movies."
5,Super Durability,"My son is a very active 2 yr old and very hard on toys, and these are great. Thick plastic construction. Easy enough for him to hook them up himself. We have 2 different kinds and they are both super."
3,Boland Rules!,"Jason Boland is one of my favorite country singers. However, this album isn't as strong as some of his previous albums are. This is still a good album and its fun to listen as it is full of songs you'd expect from the straggler himself. If you like Boland or Outlaw Country then you will find this album enjoyable at the least."
5,Great Read,"This is one of the best books I have read in a long time. I don't agree with all of the author's views or beliefs but he does a great job of discussing his life up to 30 years of age. It is a remarkable achievement. The language is easy to read but smart. The descriptions are fantastic; I have been to India but my friends who have read this book without visiting say that they feel they can see the places. Overall, this is a fun, smart and evocative read. Finally, it is telling that many of the insights he has into life are still true today."
5,Overall: Awesome,"After hearing the newest single from Madison Park, another great one to add to my collection, I decided to write a review of the full album. I've had it since it was released last summer and it hasn't left my player since. What I appreciate about Madison Park most is their ability to deliver both awesome dance songs as well as great downtempo, such as the title track ""In the Stars"". This is one of those CD's that you know you'll keep in your collection indefinitely."
4,Stars Abound,"I will be a life-time fan of Madison Park's. What brought me to their music is a song on their Boutique CD. The song is Opus One and the message of this song, if you care about animals at all, you will love it. So because of their devotion to animals I will always support them. Not to mention, the great music.BoutiqueThis album too is full of great songs like ""More Than This"" which I hearevery time I enter a shopping mall! And I also love ""I'm Listening"". Also check out the dreamy title track."
1,"Strange handset design, not durable, not recommended","This product certainly looked pretty on my wall, but that's about the only positive point. The cord to the handset was short, and had to be replaced for normal use. The handset touchpad places the numbers in two rows of buttons rather than the normal 3 rows, making it hard to find numbers. The letters on the buttons were small and nearly impossible to see while dialing. The phone worked for about 3 or 4 months, and then became gradually more and more static-prone until it stopped working -- and this was with light use, no dropping of the phone, etc. I finally gave the phone to my young daughter as a toy and went back to a boring but reliable and easy-to-use phone."
5,Have a wonderful Day Telephone!,I love this phone it is at an excellent price and it will brighten up anybodys Day!
5,The Three - A Jazz Classic of Classics,"Ever since I first heard this album as a student back at Auburn University in the mid-eighties, I became enamored with the masterfully cool, smooth, passionate jazz oozing from this incredibly famous trio of musicians. Of all the CD's/albums that I own, this one has more mystique about it than any other I own. The fact that it remains rare and extremely difficult to find only adds to that mystique. Ray Brown's bass playing is at it's best, and Shelly Manne and Joe Sample tear it up too! These guys are true jazz cats, and they make you feel their soul with every beat. The more you listen to this music, the more you will like and appreciate it. These three absolutely define the jazz trio.Most who own this CD/album will not want to give it up, so very few are on the market at any given time. If you get a chance to buy this one (at any price), buy it quickly!"
5,Quite simply one of the finest horror novels ever written.,"EPITAPH by James Siegel is quite simply one of the finest horror novels ever written. Rarely before, except in the occasional Stephen King novel, have I encountered such prose, diction, and sheer POETRY infused into a thriller.This book is an absolute page-turner. It will grip you, and the realism that comes off of it will make your own life seem false, contrived, in comparison.Enjoy this great book, and many others by James Siegel. He's easily one of America's finest living authors at present."
4,Infamous Last Case!,"William Riskin is an old fogey - full of memories, self-mockery & self-pity until he pays his respects at a funeral home & stumbles upon the deadly case his old-time partner was working on.This partner was from another time of Paris, France in the pre-WWII years. He has a history veiled & dark that only one other person in all of America knows & William is about to meet that person & discover who this partner really was.Epitaph is not just a good thriller - it is a work of fast, funny, furious deception as the hero walks the slower pace of the aged & infirm even as his mind races a mile a minute!With a tantalizing view of life from the rocking chair of retirement, James Siegel weaves a horrid, humorous & taut tale of desperate times feeding desperate hungers.William Riskin is a grandfather with whom I enjoyed keeping company!"
1,GRAVE MISTAKE,"I certainly admire Siegel for wanting to write a story that had an seventy year old as its hero. The reaffirmation that being elderly doesn't mean being dead is a good intention. However, in EPITAPH, William is so low in self-esteem and has little literary energy, so the plot moves at a snail's pace, and one can't feel the urge to finish what could possibly be a good book? I don't know cause midway through, I got tired of William and the rambling lack of action, so I didn't finish it. You'll have to decide..."
1,struggling,"Ok, ive read enough that i should be into it....Im not!!! reading the other reviews i hear a few saying its worth it in the end....ok.....ill keep going, but im disappointed at how slow it is, it started good.....but it hasnt gone back to the first character since she was mentioned!!! I loved the first two ive read by him.....so i wont give up yet.."
4,History with a Twist,"I happened on this book in an airport bookstore. It hooked me on this author. I enjoy the glimpse into an era when women's rights were the headlines. She does a very good job of presenting the issues without being preachy. The mystery is well woven into political and historical events of the day, giving the reader some insight on how complicated life could be, even in ""simplier"" times."
4,BUS SHIRT,I LIKE HIS SHIRT FITS NICE .LIKE THE SCHOOL BUS ON IT CASE I DRIVE SCHOOL BUS. THE KIDS ON MY BUS SMILE WHEN THEY SEE ME WEAR THE SHIRT. THEY DIDN'T THINK I WOULD WEAR A T SHIRT LIKE THAT. BUT !!!!!!! I DID
2,Cheap,"I was going to add this to a survival gift basket for a friend, but it is so cheaply made and packaged that it would be embarrassing to add this to it. Looks like it came from the dollar store."
4,Excellent Quality!,"This webcam is the best I've used. Although the other model I used for my desktop was very basic and is no comparison. I was pleasantly surprised by most of it's performances: the clarity of the picture, color on the screen and picture options (zoom in/out, etc.). The only draw back for me is that it's a bit unstable just dangling off of my laptop. Also it's not very travel friendly since the camera itself is attached to this long ""leg"" used to stabilize the camera and it's not removable and can't be folded. Other than that really no complains. Especially since I got a great deal with $20 amazon rebate. I would recommend this webcam for all the laptop users."
4,Logitech computer camera,"It has a lot better quality than the cheaper cameras. Clarity is much improved when used in low light. It still has some audio feedback problems when used on our laptop, but still better than a regular cheap mic."
4,Good Buy!,"The image isn't as sharp as I was expecting and the focus feature tends to have a mind of its own at times. However, there are various other features (explained quite well in the description above) which make this webcam an excellent buy."
1,Buyer Beware,"Like others have said - if you own Windows XP Media Center Edition the camera can cause lots of system problems, errors, crashes, etc - and that's if it even installs. Skip it and choose another camera."
1,After 6 months camera still does not work,"My parents, inlaws and myself have purchased this camera. None of them work. My father-in-law cannot boot-up with the camera plugged in; during a call our computer crashes with the blue-screen-of-death; my parents have had audio and video trouble. Before our computer crashes we can get in a few minutes of conversation. The audio is terrible and the video quality is terrible. We tried Skype; Yahoo; MSN and Sightspeed and all of us still had audio and video trouble on the rare occasions we could start a conversation. We all have Dell computers with Windows XP. Our systems are around 3 years old. I am sorry I had our family purchase this camera."
5,Logitech Quikcam Fusion,The Logitech Quikcam Fusion is an excellent webcam - super video and much improved audio. It also is better designed for flat panel monitors than other webcams.
5,"Light, mobile, great product!","This is a very nice webcam. I've only had a couple in the recent years, and none of them have had this level of quality. For the price, you're getting an exceptional product that truly does perform. As a lifecaster, I need something portable and light. This attaches right on top of the notebook with ease and has a rubber gripping back clip to prevent the scratching of your LCD panel or notebook. Wonderful!"
3,Not the best ...,"* Dislike that the zoom takes away from the clarity.* The picture displayed is grainy and the movements for the little avatar things don't synch up or work at all.* I communicate with people long-distance internationally where the internet streaming technology isn't the best, and the fuzzy picture ruins it, plus the zoom and focus becomes way choppier than normal.* Would rather stick to an older model of camera such as the ClickSmart510.* Orb is light and yet durable.* Orb hook easily mounts on an LCD panel, but the bi-directional swivels do not give a proper 360 deg. experience. I have to prop it up in my pencil holder cup thing if I want the camera to view the ground.* Price is great for this new product, but if given the chance, would not purchase again."
3,it would have been fine if only,"it worked with my laptop. The laptop is toshiba satellite, so be careful if buying this guy for toshiba."
4,Works great!,"My husband and I got this this so that our parents could see their grandson, as they live out of town. The webcam works really well, and is easy to set up. Some feedback issues when the camera is next to the speakers, but other than that works great."
4,"Good, but still blurry","I bought two of these...both perform well...I do like the product. However, I guess I was expecting to see a huge difference in the other one that I had. I do not. The cool thing is that I don't have to have a seperate microphone and I really like that. I also like that the view is wider than others. So if you are buying expecting to see digital camera quality pictures...you probably won't. But the ease and price I got mine from Amazon is well worth the investment."
4,Webcam,The camera itself works well although there are times when the picture freezes and the voices are a little behind the actual speaking.Setting up through Logitech for the video is simple but you only have a 30 day free trial. Then it will cost you. Other services are free and are shown.
2,Cumbersome!,It's a good cam with good sound and video performance but itis cumbersome to have round your lapdog and way too heavy to go on the road with the lead it carries!!! I would go for a more compact lightweight version from Logitech next time round. Other than weight and overall size no complaints.
4,QuickCam is great for Video phone calls!,"So far, I have only used this camera once but it worked very well and lived up to all of its advertised capabilities. I used it on Skype.The only con I found was that it made my audio on my computer start to crackle even when I am not using the camera. If I disable the camera completely, the crackling goes away. This may also be just my computer and other computers may not have this little problem."
3,Great quality,"Excellent quality for a webcam with very good built in microphone. Easily fits on any type of monitor or on a desk. Pivots up and down, butI wish it would also pan left and right.You will need a fairly modern computer to use this camera. It doesn't need to be the latest and greatest, but if you're still running Windows 98, you might not want to consider this.The camera produces great picture quality and has some nice features. Face tracking really isn't one of those features. It just doesn't work well enough to be useful, especially in low light situations or if you're pretty far from the camera.The software is a little obtrusive. I feel like it's constantly presenting me with buttons that don't interest me while making it difficult to get to the settings that I do change often (such as zoom and pan)."
4,"Great image, no support for Winxx","I get an absolutely gorgeous image on Win2000. It bugs me that their are no drivers for WinMe, which I prefer since it takes a quarter of the time to boot. Haven't tried XP yet since it's just a remake of 2000 with a bunch of extra features I don't need."
4,Very good Picture,"I like my webcam . It has automatic focus when daylight or night - no problem when it`s all dark in my room. Even if you move a lot it has a special function that it will follow your face on a conversation. Microphone is OK.I give it 4 stars because when I finally installed my webcam and turned off my computer and later turned it on ,had to plug it in another usb slot for a correct operation. After that had no problems."
2,"Well, I returned it!","I'd been using a Creative WebCam Live Pro and was extremely satisfied by the picture quality. I bought this one hoping that the clarity would be excellent. The reviews I read gave me the confidence to invest on this cam. Unforunately, I was not satisfied with the picture quality when I compared it to the previous webcam used. The Creative had a yellow tint to the pictures but the night light performance was excellent. The Logitech had more natural colors but the night light performance was horrible. Even when I increased the exposure to 1/5s, the object remained in dark. I do most of my chatting during the nights and I felt that it was not worth the $50-60 I spent on it."
4,logitech webcam,"I've been very happy with the logitech quickcam. Picture is very good, it's very easy to use, and very easy to set up. Would highly recommend this webcam."
2,"nice design, driver issues",this is a nice little webcam but with one huge flaw - it crashes certain OS - I have the Media Edition 05 and it certainly crashed mine. Not just once - nine out of ten times....many Logitech webcams have this issue. Check their website for a complete list (somewhere under tech support...). I ended up buying the Logitech 4000Pro and am very pleased....
4,Good webcam that I have ever purchased!,This is very good webcam. I had purchased creative webcams and those were not so good. But this webcam doesn't work with some of computers like centrinos. It says your bois doesn't support or dirver file has corrupted. I have another laptop P4 from toshiba. It works perfectly fine. Image/video/sound quality is good. I don't see any negatives looking at the price at which I am getting this. I will recommend this webcam to others.
3,Decent Webcam,Nice camera. Serves the purpose I purchased it for. Some features see a little flaky and difficult to control.
4,Great for keeping in touch with distant relatives.,"It's blurry sometimes, and the delay from the service is sometimes bad on the weekends, but it's a great way for kids to stay in touch with grandparents."
3,Webcam for Skype,"Purchased primarily to use with Skype on my Macintosh. Could not use software (on CD) provided with this camera since it was developed only for pc and not macs. Macintosh OSX (Tiger version) contains driver for this webcam, therefore it works. It would really be a 5-star camera if software (on CD) was also compatible with macs. Good quality transmitted video with Skype and well designed camera mount."
2,unable to get to work with my PC,"the quality of this webcam was excellent. However, I couldn't get it to work with Yahoo or Google."
1,Couldn't get it to work,"We couldn't get this to work. The screen would just turn blue. I spent about 10 hours on the phone with tech support with Microsoft, Dell, and Logitech but no one could get it to work. This was a disappointment and now I have to navigate a potentially arduous return process. Maybe it will work for you."
4,Resolution is definitely better than the lower ones.,Great resolution. I like it how it can rest on my notebook. Great camera!
4,Nice cam for the most part,This cam isnt bad ... gets grainy in bigger formats. I wish I would have spent a little more for the 9000 model that has autofocus really. This cam isnt bad and is a big improvement from what I did have anyway.
3,promises are not within reach,"The sound is distruckted, camera is not following the subject, sharpness is not better than my previous camera that costed $17.00"
3,"Image quality good, form factor not so good","Not too bad on my desktop LCD, but pretty inconvenient and clumsy on my laptop. It's been in the drawer for a long time now."
3,alex,The Microphone has too much echo noise and I have to use another pc microphone instead. The video part works fine.
5,Logitech Quickcam Fusion,This is the second Logitech Quickcam that I have bought over the last 3 months. What I love about the Logitech Quickcam is the ease of installation (load a disc and plug in usb cable); plus the many features of the cam. I have recommended this cam to several of my friends and family. The price is right and the product is exceptional.
4,AS PRESENTED,"This web cam performs as it should. It is well priced, and loaded and ran without a hitch."
4,I CAN See You!!,"This was my first webcam purchase and I do believe that I made a good decision. It does exactly what it is supposed to do and it has some really cute and fun options. However, I will say that the voice distribution is a bit slow at times and it may drag, but overall a good product."
4,Get the latest software for camera,"So far, so good ... warning *** received the BSOD due to software bugs and my brand new 1501 Dell. After talking to Logitech's customer support, they said I should download v11. When installing the camera, no updates were available; however, the updates are for the version you are installing from disk. After uninstalling v10 and installing v11, everything works great."
4,"Nice camera, BUT some software problems...","I like the camera, but I was disappointed when I first install the software and got the blue screen of hell...again, and again, then try to fix the problem myself reading the logitech online support about the actually same problem that people heve been having, and fixed it... then audio problem, called logitech tech support, and they told me that is a problem between Dell computers and Logitech software (my case), and the fix is on the way...so I was a little bit mad with the experience, but after using the camera a litle bit, I really like the quality of the picture... and I can't wait to update the audio software."
3,Very nice item but still has a problem,"The webcam is working well. However, there are a problem at the beginning. Since the webcam software has a conflict with Dell computer, the monitor turns blue when connecting the webcam to the computer. The problem was solved by changing a file type in system32 (use google to search for the similar problem)."
2,Driver issues,"It has a nice wide view. Video quality is good. I've had audio problems and still do. I had recommended this Fusion to a coworker, and they also had problems with audio. My brother inlaw installed the fusion cam on he's Dell laptop, after installing drivers, everytime he would try to run the web cam, he would get the B.S.O.D (Blue Screen Of Death).I'm a big fan of Logitech, but I can't recommend this product."
4,Webcam,We love this little gadget. Sets up easily and helps us stay up close and personal with our friends and family that are far away.
4,It's a Good Cam,This is a good cam. It is also my 1st. I bought this cam with 2 considerations. 1. Price after rebate 2. What people said about it. It has quirks but for $55 bucks so be it. It is good for what I use it for. You get what you pay for. I think it is a good deal. I give it 4 because their is some room for improvement in video quality
2,Solar battery does not work well.,the one I received needs a lot of sun light to work. If it is morning and is cloudy or if the windows are not wide open it does not work. I think they are much better products for the same price.
3,not worth inflated price,calculator works fine as a relatively cheap calculator (3.99 or less). this is the second time amazon has doubled the price. i know cause i bought another one after it finally went down again. not worth the nearly $9-$10 amazon is now AGAIN asking. got both of mine for under $4. hold off if interested
2,Ho hum...,"Nothing in particular on this disc jumps out at you and screams grounbreaking. To me, Planeside seems... well rather plain. While I would give this independent band an A for effort, and they certainly are an energetic live band, the execution here is mediocre at best. (The production is quite good though)"
4,Great purchase!,I was worried when first making the purchase that they would not work or they'd be defective but they work perfectly! Very happy with the purchase.
3,Haynes Manual vs. Others,"Repair manuals for these are easily found used. I prefer the Clymer version, and the original Honda Manual is best. Haynesis good but it feels a bit ""stodgy."" I keep it mostly as areference when working on problems. It is good to have different perspectives (ie- more manuals!)"
3,Okay,It is a owners manual. It came in good shape and it had all the pages. If you need one get this
2,Honda CB 750 Owners workshop manual- Haynes Manuals,"Shows ""big"" stuff but little is given for the routine maintenance. Pictures don't relate to a sequence, just random items. The troubleshooting in each Chapter is pretty good though. Still worth having in conjunction with other manuals."
2,It's really small,"I needed this a prop for a talk to a group. It fit in my hand. It was three times smaller then I imagined, too small for Barbie and perfect for GI Joe."
2,Too small to play,"This toy is more of a show item. It is too small to play even for little fun. Looks cure, but I would be careful to give to any small kids. Slightly bigger would have made value of this toy much higher."
2,Billiards Review,"Well, thought the toy would be larger, but it's still a cute size for a desk toy. Not a lot of surface space, so I don't really play around with this, it's just for show on my desk. Guess I didn't pay attention to the actual size when I ordered it..."
3,Ho Hum,"I realize this is one of the definitive studies of the PBGV, but for the average prospective pet owner, it is just a slog. The first 200-some pages are devoted to the evolution of the breed from one country and century to another. Ho hum. It wasn't until page 243 that I finally found what I needed to know about the characteristics of the dog that would matter to me as a potential owner."
5,Excellent work,"I recently went to see ""Dr. Hook(?) featuring Ray Sawyer,"" and walked away somewhere between discouraged and disgusted. Fortunately for me, Amazon monitors my tastes and notified me of this album, (I mean CD) and I was thrilled to know that the talents of a former band is still alive in Dennis.There will probably never be another Shel Silverstein, and Dennis would be the last one to try. The combination of writing, production, and raw talent of Dr. Hook may never be replicated either, and again, Dennis has not tried. This work shows a compilation of his influence on the band, and the bands influence on him.At 52, I'm not as easily thrilled as I once was, but I am thrilled with this. Buy it, enjoy it, and hopefully, he'll do another."
2,Chalk,"Took long to receive, odd because such small packaging. It was the right thing I was looking for. Good purchase."
2,"Seems like good chalk, wish it had arrived in one piece","I'm using this on a painted-wall chalkboard, and it does have a nice quality to writing. My complaint is that out of 12 sticks, only 3 arrived intact, most were broken in two or three places. In hindsight, perhaps mail-order chalk isn't the best idea."
5,GO FORTH AND BUY!,"This chalk is perfect. I bought a chalk board for me to do trigonometry problems and purchased this chalk, and it was such a good buy i got three of them!I highly recommend this chalk. I've tried others, but they aren't anywhere near as good as these."
2,Its a fun game if you aren't colorblind.,"My husband is a big card game lover and I thought this would make a great stocking stuffer. I had read the description and while it did say to ""spell 'Cheater' in the same color suit"" I had no idea that the letters on those cards were also different colors. The red letters on a purple background are completely indistinguishable to my colorblind husband. He also has problems with the yellow letters on the red background. It looks like one big grayish mess to him. Others enjoy it quite a bit. It's just not a good one if you have problems seeing colors."
4,Excellent Rainy Day Game,"I've owned Cheater in the past and my family loves to play it. I recently had to purchase it again on Amazon because I couldn't find it in the local stores. My son loves it because every turn allows him the chance to become the ""cheater."" The game is fair in that every turn requires a roll of the dice to either try to become the ""cheater"" or to maintain your ""cheater"" status. Excellent for family game night."
4,It's Always Something,"Gilda's heart, as well as her short-comings, shown through this cancer saga, making her so real. It was good sharing this one-way communication regarding ovarian cancer experience, even while knowing that times and protocols have changed -- for the better.It's Always Something made it more personal and gave me the opportunity to get another cancer patients perspective on this disease.The last two pages warmed my heart and were the core of the entire book, to be read and re-read. Thanks to Gilda for bringing this silent disease to the fore."
1,Smoky,When I opened the package all I could smell was cigarette smoke. The pages of the book were saturated with nicotine and I was very disappointed.I tried to contact the seller for a replacement book but have been unsuccessful.It took a little over a week to receive the book.My over all score for this item would be (1).
4,Wonderful and sad,"I could not help feeling a sense of sadness hovering over me while reading this book. After all, I knew the end already. This made it even harder to go through the passages where Gilda is full of hope, or when she receives good news about her remission. It was very courageous of her to put her thoughts on paper, and I am sure so many people have benefited from reading about her experiences. It always amazes me how people can be so candid about their ""dirty laundry"". For example, her cancer had a negative impact on her marriage. There were fights, some very ugly, and yet she is able to bare it all. I am sure it was not with a voyeuristic sense, but to show what havoc cancer can run in your life, and how you are not alone in your feelings. Ultimately this is what she found at The Wellness Community, and what she wished to give back. Good for her."
2,Expected more Gilda witticisms.......,but the reality of the subject makes it understandable.Do not recommend for breast cancer patients.Just not that uplifting. Sorry....
4,Insightful book revealing the very intimate details of her struggle with cancer.,"A very personal story filled with love and laughter. I'm a cancer survivor and I could relate to many of the issues surrounding her diagnosis and treatments. Unfortunately, we lost a wonderful human being when cancer took her young life!"
5,"Brilliant, Cry Laugh and Remember Gilda",This is a fun and tearful biograph about Gilda Radner. She talks about her life with a weight issues and her battle with cancer. She gives an indepth account of Chemotherapy and the things that got her through. I will alway miss Gilda. This is an excellent book to read.
5,Classic American journalism,"From 1955 to 1957, Boise, Idaho, was caught in the grip of a full-blown Gay panic that made national headlines and gave Idaho's judicial system a black eye. This study of the panic, published in 1965, is both of its time and decades ahead of it. Gerassi brilliantly dissects the (chiefly economic) motives of people involved in promoting and prosecuting the scandal. He also displays a sharp eye for character and incidental detail._The Boys of Boise_ is a must-read for anyone with an interest in GLBT history and a classic piece of investigative journalism in its own right. (Neil Miller covers a similar scandal in Sioux City, IA, with the somewhat inferior _Sex Crime Panic_.)"
1,The Boys of Boise,"I came across the original book ""Boys From Boise,"" at the Eastern Washington College library archives, while I was doing some research there during the late 70's. The original book told of a group of business men and city officials that was molesting young males. Many of the abusers were married Mormons. Huge scandal, that became hush-hush. Many of the abusers moved away from Boise, but some of them stayed.I would love it, if people would not rewrite the original book to cover up the actual story."
3,Not gonna write home about it.,Disposable gloves which tear quite easily. Not sure about the Nitrile part. Feels more like latex. Tends to tear quite easily when exposed to brake parts cleaner.
2,Not so tough,"I have a couple problems with these gloves. First off, they do not resist alcohol very well, the glove melts after about 10 minutes of light use. Also, I ordered them in small, and they are still quite large, and don't ""fit like a glove"""
4,Very Cute Flats!,"I ordered these in Vintage Copper, very nice color combination! They match well with many different colors. The only complaint I have is, the shoes feel snug, meaning they run maybe a 1/4 size smaller. I would want to order 1/2 size bigger than what I normally wear. If you have to walk long periods of time; your feet might swell up, then they become somewhat tight and uncomfortable. Nevertheless, if you're not gonna walk much, the shoes do look very cute!"
2,Good for price / basic product,"This item is good for the price I paid ($10), but is a bit big for being a womans helmet. It doesn't really have enough extra padding pieces to make it that much smaller. Comparatively with helmets you can buy in the store these days, it seems much more like the helmets I wore when I rode my bike in the 80's. The ones that slide all over your head. Bell is a good brand, but i was a little disappointed in the overall quality. But for 10 bucks, heck, you cant find anything in a store for that price. But if you add shipping cost, you might as well just get something from the store, have it now, and have top quality."
3,Too big for women?,"I thought the quality was decent enough, especially given the low price, so no complaints there. I trust Bell products to adhere to at least minimum safety guidelines. I have an average size head and it was too loose for me and did not come with any additional padding to make adjustments, so I returned it knowing that a loose helmet is not much better than no helmet at all. I'm going to try another style."
2,The size does not fit,The seller should have mentioned its exact size in the web page instead of just saying Medium/Large. I found it too small for me until I tried it on.
4,Eclectic,"Move Into Villa Villa Kula is an essential mixof riot grrl, spoken word, punk, pop & folk.The majority of tracks on here are excellent,the only ones I didn't really warm to werethe spoken word tracks by Eileen Myles.Standout tracks include ""You 'Aint It!"" bythe ever brilliant Sleater-Kinney, the beautiful""Erica"" by Tattle Tale and ""Peyton Versus YourBoyfriend"" by Kaia.The artists on this CD may not be household names,but that's the beauty of it. There's somethinghere for everyone."
1,nothing more than a sign that David Wong is privileged,"This CD is just another example of people that have lots of money, power, prestige, and connections. I don't hear much talent on this CD, and anyone these days can come out with a CD. All you need is a little $$ and a comptuer and voila, you've got yourself a CD. I admit ""With Absolute Enthusiasm"" is creative, catchy, and a good song, but everything else on this CD you can get from your local Walmart for less."
1,"Sorry, terrible","....This is on a par with ""Music Box Dancer"" doodlings,virtually unlistenable to anyone who has ever heard piano playing ofgenuine feeling and depth. If the best jazz pianists, for example,draw deeply from a well of development and inspiration, thisself-produced CD is barely a puddle....Other than flat-out hittingwrong notes, this is as bad as it gets. I feel.... compelled to warnanyone else who has even a modicum of musical sophistication andstandards to avoid doing so...."
2,Unsatisfied customer.,"This trumpet looks nice, and the notes are easy to reach--IF the valves worked! No amount of valve oil makes them glide. I have to pull them up with my fingers between almost every note--and that doesn't make for very fast trumpet-playing! I think it's a nice beginner instrument if one could get the valves to work! Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it!One other thing of note is that the case is poorly made. The trumpet moves freely inside the case when it is closed, and the the first time I opened it, the 1/16th inch thick valour inside lining of the case was cracked to reveal the white stirofoam underneath.I ended up buying an Amati pocket trumpet to replace it, and it works (and looks) beautiful! And the case inside is actually shaped to the horn and has a plush lining!"
4,A taste of the 1800's,A good look back into Jefferson's time and at some of the French recipes he brought back from Paris. Most of the recipes are quite tasty today.
5,Hardness Means Happiness,"Well, not exactly. Let's just say hardness makes you feel like a man. Dr. Lamm and co-author Gerald Secor Couzens have given us information that any real man needs as his performance begins to wane.Many physicians seem to shy away from telling male patients about foods and supplements that can help to restore their reproductive health. The Hardness Factor also stresses that sensible eating and vigorous exercise canhelp them keep it up.H. Trussell Pyle is author of the novel Charlie's Hoot. He also is the author of Stairway to Serenity, Turning it Over, and co-author of In God's Care (As We Understand God), all having to do with recovery from alcoholism and drug addiction."
3,Mixed feelings,There are a few things that were interesting and I didn't know. There are other things that were a waste of time. I have mixed feelings towards this book.
2,A Cookbook,There isn't anything here but a collection of recipes. Fact is I barely looked at it because of that. When I scanned through it and saw that I was very disappointed. Thank you.
5,Fantastic...,I recommend this book to anyone with or without any ED problem. It is a wonderful fountain of health. Best wishes...
4,Scholarship as a blood sport,"This small but deadly book might have been titled ""Jung strips bare his biographers"" for in it, historian of psychology Sonu Shamdasani takes Jung's own words, meticulously researched and documented, and uses them to expose the factual inaccuracy of nearly every biography of Jung ever written. It's a challenging book because as each fabrication is unearthed we get closer to the facts about Jung but further from his truth. It's a shame Shamdasani doesn't go on to explore why Jung the man generates so many unsupportable stories, but speculation isn't Shamdasani's style. He prefers to use scholarship as a deadly weapon, which he does with devastating precision, leaving behind a staggering body count of reputations. If you have read a biography of Jung, read Shamdasani and find out how little you really know, as I have."
1,Out of date and incorrect - avoid,"For a book that has been through a number of revisions over several years one would expect accuracy, credibility and efficacy. Sadly this book fails on every count. It starts by listing the masses of simple molecules incorrectly (O2 = 34) and continues with poorly drawn diagrams and overly wordy explanation. I can find little up to date in this 'new' release, it really is just a poor rehash of dated material.As an experienced mass spectrometrist I hoped this book word serve as a nice introduction to the field of GC/MS for new staff. Sadly it was received by new colleagues as dated and with little credibility.Save yourself $60 and try Wikipedia instead."
4,Fantastic list of tips for a GC/MS user,The book may be considered difficult for a starting user. I have been working with GC/MS for 10 years and the coments and all explanations inside are really and absolutely useful. Unfortunately I had not such a book when I was starting to deal with this technique.
2,Croscill Townhouse Tissue / Kleenex Cover,"This tissue cover is absolutely beautiful, as is the entire croscill townhouse bath and bedding line. I bought this tissue cover but returned it because it it much larger than the box of tissues that it covers; therefore it wastes precious counter space, as well as the tissues falling back down into the cover because the cover is so much larger than the box. It got aggravating and I felt just wasn't worth the money. I feel that this is the only townhouse bath accessory piece that isn't worth the price. It costs nearly as much as the large wastebasket. Doesn't make sense to me. If you can find this for about $10-$15, I would recommend getting it, just so you have the entire bath set because the townhouse pattern has been discontinued and you won't be able to find it later. But if not, I wouldn't waste the money on it. It's pretty, just not practical because it doesn't go it's job. It's huge."
5,Scarguard worked for me,"I used it on my arm scar and it has reduced it significantly. I used it twice a day as the product advises for 2 consecutive weeks, now my scar is barely noticeable."
3,Not much noticeable difference ~ 3 months,"I was recommended the product by my plastic surgeon. It seems like a waste becasue it doesnt stay on. At the end of the day and even overnight, I notice that it has peeled off. It smells horrible but it did help the redness go away in the begining. I have started to use vitamin E capsules instead and they seem to make my scars softer and less noticeable. I may have given up on it too soon I have passed it on to my mother for her tummy tuck scar, Ill see how it works for her and update."
3,Works fairly well,"This worked to lessen my scars, but did not get rid of the larger ones. I think this is a good product, but very expensive!"
3,So-so,"I was hoping to be impressed with this product, but after a month of use I find it so-so. While I think it could be beneficial for smaller scars,I used mine for a heart surgery scar. The product loosens and peels very easily. Perhaps it would work better in a less mobile area. I apply it twice a day as directed and have only detected the slightest change in color and texture of the scar. I realize it must be used for a long time for any real improvement. At almost $30 for a small bottle, I think the silicone sheeting would work better."
1,WHAT did the other reviewer read?,"Excuse me? ""A touch of sadness""? How about the blackmail, truly disgusting blackmail, that the hero uses to get the heroine to sleep with him? He won't tell her dying father that the heroine's brother is a homosexual, plus he'll save the family business, IF she sleeps with him three times.Sorry but the author lost me after that. I could not believe any woman would forgive that kind of behavior, let alone fall in love with the hero after it. The author tries to fob off the blackmail toward the end, by having the hero admit he was ""forced"" into this behavior, because the heroine turned him down on dates for a year -- HOW WEAK! He couldn't take her rejection so he decided to blackmail her into bed. UGH. This book is no romance, it's just plain disgusting. Avoid at all costs."
5,"An informative,accurate and well researched book","This book is a detailed and enjoyable read. The author does a great job describing the German Army,basic tactics,equipment and a larger strategic picture.The pictures included are of outstanding quality.I highly recommend this book."
4,Excellent war photos!,"I liked this book, the photographs are excellent (and rare) and really give a good idea of what the German army looked like. The reason to buy the book is for the large format photos, not the text. For written descriptions, I recommend ""Forgotten Soldier"" but Guy Sajer for a gripping account of combat on the Eastern Front."
2,Great toy but parts missing!!!,"I love this toy and so does my 4 monthly old daughter. It keeps her occupied in the car and easily distracted while we are driving (she is not a huge fan of being in the car). I gave this such a low rating because the loop on the sun suction that is illustrated in the picture which allows you to connect the caterpillar to the sun was not there! There was NO WAY to attach the mobile to the suction arm! I had to rig up a way to connect them with some durable string and while I was able to get it connected and put in the car for my daughter to love its still pretty lame that such an essential part was missing... If I were to see this in a store and could be sure that all parts were present I would buy this toy again and would recommend it to friends... but don't buy it online, go to Target and get it there instead."
3,Could have done without this toy,"It's a good toy, not a great toy. My daughter could have done without it. I would pass if given another chance and put the money towards another toy. It's just an awkward toy. It doesn't fit well on the car seat-it kept hitting my daughter in the face. And it's too far away on her window so she couldn't really play with it. It's cute, just not easy to play with or use."
2,Poor design,My baby has had some fun with this toy (3-5months) but it definately ranks far down the list of toys he enjoys and I'm sure there are hundreds of others I could have purchased instead of this one and gotten more playtime out of them. The suction cup works but only if you have a place to suction it that your baby can't reach but can see and it doesn't frustrate him to not be able to touch his toys. All the pieces come apart from each other which is nice but also a problem if you're trying to keep it together. Most babies are stronger than velcro and magnetic clasps. It's also just not as interesting to look at or chew as many other toys we've tried.
4,Cute and easy to use,"I bought this for my car - so far I haven't had any problems with suction, etc. My daughter seems to like it."
4,My baby loves this...,My baby loves this toy! I never forget to bring it with us wherever we go. She gets bored very easily and this toy keeps her occupied for a long time.
3,Cute!,"My son loves this toy. The only thing that I don't like about it is that it's constanly falling off the car window. The suction on the bar is'nt that good. It also hangs really low where the toys are always falling off. I like it better when we use it on the stroller, but other than that it's a cute toy."
1,"Not really a mobile...suctiong cup arm, too short","First off, this really isn't a mobile, nothng moves, its just a loop of fabic haning on a arm with a suction cup. The loop has three animals haning from it. This isn't so bad but the suction cup arm doesn't extend far enough from the window of our Honda Element for it to even near our child...she simply can see it. This may work fine for small cars where the child may be closer to the window but if you think it might be a issue in your car, chances are it will..."
5,Great Mobile,Gave as a gift and both the mommy and the baby were thrilled. Did just what it was supposed to do - keep the little one occupied for hours!
3,Lost my suction,"We suctioned this onto the window of our car. Within about 4 days, the suction part flattened out, losing the concave suction ability. This was a shame because our baby was so captivated by it. It's very multipurpose so not all is lost, but very disappointed about our defective suction."
2,bitter,"I had previously tasted the pumpkin seed version of this snack, and it was very good. I went ahead and ordered them in the walnut version because walnuts are supposed to be so healthy. These turned out to be very bitter. My children had to spit them out. Some of them were bitter from the first bite, and others just had a bitter aftertaste. I was informed by Amazon that you cannot return food items, so I went back and tried them again. There seem to be some good ones among the bad, but for the most part, they have a bitter taste."
3,A little bit bitter,"I am a big fan of Mrs. May's products. I have tried the cashew and almond crunches and found them a delicious snack. I looked forward to trying the walnut crunch as I know walnuts are very healthy for you. Unfortunately, I found the walnut crunch to be a bit bitter, not horribly so, but more than I like."
1,YOU WILL LOVE THIS IF YOU ARE A TERMITE,It is hard to believe that anyone would buy this more than once. It tasted like sawdust sweetened with a little honey. It was dry and bitter. I put most of it out for the critters in the forest behind me. Even the raccoons and squirrels would not eat it.
4,I dont lik'em but the folks lov'em,"Am not a big fan myself, but I handed them out to many family friends and they loved these. Walnut apparently does much less damage relative to Almond and Cashew nuts."
5,"He is the Vine, we are the branches","This book teaches us the importance of obeying the Lord's Word, and commands. I relate it to the story of Jesus being the Vine and we are the branches. If the branches are cut off from the vine, they whither and die. Dead branches are then worthless, producing no fruit. So, then we throw them into the fire. This is what our lives are like, as Corrie shows us, apart from our Saviour, we can do nothing. She shows us how we have to abide in Him if our lives are to bear fruit and have meaning. She uses her experiences in this book, from people and the lessons the Lord taught her from her travels around the world. All of Corrie's books remain so helpful and encouraging!"
5,Not Good If Detached (Corrie Ten Boom Library),I recommend any thing that Corrie Ten Boom writes. I have several of her books and have downloaded some of her sermons at [...]
3,"Lost Ground: Welfare Reform, Poverty, and Beyond","Compilation of many writers' summations of America's welfare policies and attitudes over the years, and how the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 adversely affected the poorest in our country. Very informative, but bogs down in the middle as several narratives are rather redundant. Be sure to read the last chapter!"
1,"Great concept, unfortuately it is garbage!!","Same thing that happened to the previous poster happened to my son's toy. The turtle cup came off after the first use (and within 20 min!). My son is 8 months old and it can't even withstand the pulling of an 8 month old. And a sharp screw is revealed when the cup comes off. Luckily we noticed it before my son was injured, unfortunately I had to remove it immediately which of course upset my son, who no longer had his toy to play with. I would pay more for something that is quality so it is sad and amazing that companies put out cheap quality products that break immediately and expose dangerous parts. I would recommend that you do not buy this item. I now have to waste more time returning it to the store."
2,Mommy to Baby #2,"I bought this toy bar for my second child and absolutely loved it at first. My daughter loves to play and chew on the toys and it keeps her totally entertained for trips to the mall or doctor. It fits beautifully on my Graco Quattro Tour stroller. The big drawback is the turtle snack cup came off, revealing a screw, which scratched my daughters arm. I feel Sassy needs to recall this item and make some adjustments. The only reason I give it 2 stars is because of the potential hazard of the cup coming off."
4,Entertaining space opera,"I prefer hard science fiction to space opera, but Past's scifi romance was recommended by a fellow Texan who especially enjoyed the multiple excursions through the Davis Mountains and other West Texas environs. So did I, but I also was entertained by the unusual, always-surprising plot and the good, page-turning writing. It's hard to write simply and inoffensively for a wide audience, but Past does it very well. There's humor and suspense, as well as romance, here and just enough science to keep it interesting. I especially liked the ending, which was a natural segue into the sequels to come."
5,Enormous fun!,"The very fast-paced plot is based on some interesting premises, there are many well-sketched characters (and some good character development), and the book is loaded with local color of several flavors. I'd add that there's a touch of innocence about the worldview that reminds me slightly of golden-age SF. I'm systematically reading my way through the series, and I recommend it highly."
2,Barely science fiction.,I'm an avid sci~fi reader. I've read a lot of mediocre books through to the end. i could not finish this book. Simple. Painfully slow. Unrewarding. I'm mad at myself for hanging on as long as I did.
2,Puerile,"While the overall story is interesting, I found the treatment of the female protagonist immature. The descriptions and interactions of the protagonist remind me of a teenage boy's fantasy - quite disappointing really.If you enjoy the unusual ideas and situations common to most Sci-Fi, you'll probably enjoy this book. If you're also interested in the exploration of relationships between characters you'll likely find this book immature in it's treatment. In the end I couldn't finish the book (very rare for me) because of this."
5,"Great, Innovative Twist on Science Fiction","""Distant Cousin"" caught my interest from the beginning, and never let me down. The development of the characters was excellent, and I found myself totally engrossed in the story. I found Al Past's twist on the science fiction genre (with romance and adventure woven into the plot) to be a refreshing change of pace from the other novels that I've read lately.I would recommend this book to anyone who is in the mood for a science fiction/romance/adventure story that's set in locales ranging from New Mexico to Florida to Barbados and beyond. The sights, sounds, and other sensory details in ""Distant Cousin"" drew me in, and I'm looking forward to reading the next three books in this series."
1,Juvenile,Not worth the bother if you are a reasonably sophisticated reader. Teens may do better. This is not a new Iain M Banks...
4,"Inventive, entertaining and well-written","Typically, once I move beyond the pantheon of the all-time great SciFi writers (e.g., Clark, Bradbury, Heinlein, Brin, Niven, Sturgeon...), I find myself disappointed in the quality of the writing. I don't mean this as a slam on the genre, only on my difficulty in finding SciFi novelists who can combine a good SciFi storyline with good writing. Al Past is such a novelist. From the opening line, Distant Cousins leaves no doubt that its author knows his way around the English language. Other reviews have explained the story line, so I'll simply say that if you like SciFi, and prefer that it be well-written, you should give Distant Cousins a try."
4,Fine Feathered Friends,"In this book the cat in the hat comes back again to visit Dick and Sally, but this time he doesn't create a mess. This time he has come to teach them all about birds. To start off with he talks about birds in general, how they have feathers and a tail and hatch out of eggs. Then he, Thing 1, and Thing 2 take Sally and Dick to different places to introduce them to several different types of birds, such as the spoonbill, emperor penguin, bald eagle, ostrich and more. The cat then leads them all into his Fine Feather, All-Weather Flying Machine, getting them home just in time so that their mother doesn't notice they were gone. This book is very informative, and is written in rhyme. The pictures are bright, bold and colorful. Somehow though, this book fails to capture my attention and hold it, making it not one of the best books I've read by this author.Loggie-log-log-log"
3,NOT for the chalkboard,"i somehow missed that this chalk is NOT for the chalkboard. i'll be saving this for chalk drawing on paper, although i would have bought the pastel chalks instead."
1,Crayola chalk-picture of product is incorrect!,Totally not what I ordered. The picture shows a large box and really all you get is 12 pieces.... I would not have paid that price for a 12 pack of chalk. Forgot to call and it's past the 30 day return
4,NOT FOR CHALKBOARDS!!!!!,JUST MAKE SURE YOU ARE NOT GETTING THESE FOR YOUR CHALKBOARD! THEY ARE MEANT FOR PAPER PRODUCTS. THEY ARE SUPER OTHERWISE.
3,Buy with a Magic Eraser pad to Remove Staining!,"If you are buying these for a little one, pick up a Magic Eraser pad from your local grocery store, Walmart, or Target! Chalks stain carpeting just like permanent markers do! The only way I've managed to remove permanent marker and chalk stains from carpeting was with water and a Magic Eraser, plus lots of scrubbing. Drawing chalks are great for little ones, until they end up on the carpet or walls!!"
2,crayola colored chalk-rip off,When I bought this for my son at Christmas I couldn't believe how small the pieces of chalk were and also didn't realize that the box contained only 12(my fault for assuming that the price MUST be for a larger quantity box). It was way too much money for what I got. NOT a good deal at all!!!
3,Great Colors,"The colors offered in this pack are vibrant and beautiful. The packet arrived though with some of the chalk pieces cracked into smaller pieces. It's just what chalk does, I know. Maybe they should make it in smaller pieces though in the first place."
3,The best of nothing,"The book of Sukumar Sen is very popular among people who have any interest on Bengali literature. But the main reason of such a popularity is absence of good contemporary researches in the field. Nevertheless, you can find a lot of useful information and , what is much more important , well- developed guide through the pages of the book. This is a good starting point for future work."
3,used DRD435RH Receiver,"Packing of receiver was excellent. Delivery was prompt. However, there was no activation card and no mention that it was there or not in the advert explanation. So I still have an unhappy wife and out more money to get one."
3,"not cross-over enough for me, but my kids are gonna love it","As a seasoned listener of classical and classical-contemporary music, and one who has enjoyed the - as the editorial reviewer has it - ""ponderous classicism of Kronos's African explorations"" (and the non-African ones too, see my reviews ofPieces of Africa,Terry Riley: Cadenza on the Night Plain,Terry Riley: Salome Dances for Peace,String Quartets 2 & 3), this Zebra is not cross-over ENOUGH for me. I mean: as the same editorial reviewer underlines, it stays WAY beyond the line of Classical music, and well into the territory of easy-listening pop music, with a south-African tinge. In fact, other than the gratuitousness of that comment on the supposed ""ponderousness"" of Kronos (what's ponderous about it?), I find the editorial review fair enough and well-balanced. So this is not for me, but my 4 and 7-year olds are gonna love it, what a change from Beethoven and Brahms, the poor kids!"
5,Zebra Crossing -SSQ,"Zebra Crossing is an absolute masterpiece! After seeing SSQ perform with the Dance Theatre of Harlem (The South African Suite) at the Kennedy Center in Washington DC, I immediately ordered the ZC for my collection. The music is absolutley wonderful and uplifting. I feel a true sense of pride for these musicians who have profoundly harmonized both the struggle and celebration of South Africians triumphs over apartheid - Mbayi Mbayi!"
5,Best show on TV,"The Good Wife is our favorite show on TV, intelligent & realistic. A strong antidote to the naive belief that our adversarial criminal justice system is designed to produce justice aand that our electoral process is designed to pick the best people. A great tutorial on the moral compromises people must make when trying to do good in such a system, and the ones they will make when they just care about coming out on top."
3,Instant Video 3-4 mins short- cuts off ending,"3 stars are for the amazon video issues- I love The Good Wife- that ia always 5 stars. Episode 11 ""What Went Wrong"" is supposed to be 44 mins long- it abruptly ends at 40 mins in the middle of the final scene. I want to know the ending of episodes I watch. Not good."
2,NOT AS DESCRIBED,"When I purchased this item, The Good Wife: The Third Season, the item description stated NEW. After I received this DVD set and given as a Christmas gift I was informed it was very obvious that it was re packaged and used. The DVDs were not in proper order inside the case as new DVDs would be when factory packaged and some looked used/worn and scratched. I,m very disappointed with this transaction especially in being lied to. I also purchased Seasons One & Two from Amazon and they came as described, NEW...."
2,Doesn't Compare to First Two Seasons,"There are too many sexually ""intimate"" scenes without the ethical glue to hold the story together. I would say it's a must miss."
2,Not Nearly as Good as First Two Seasons,"In this season, there are too many sexually ""intimate"" scenes without the ethical glue to hold the series together. It's a miss."
1,"Wish I could view it, but alas here's a shocker for you, will not load.","Wish I could view it, but alas here's a shocker for you, will not load. I want my money back."
