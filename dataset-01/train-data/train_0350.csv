3,Confusing Rebate,I&#65533;m really disappointed with Symantec and Amazon on the &#65533;rebate&#65533; for this product. When I searched for the product I found it listed with a &#65533;rebate&#65533; icon. Only after I received and was billed for the product did I notice the &#65533;rebate&#65533; only applied to previous owners of this software. I&#65533;ve got to believe that the overwhelming majority of folks who purchase this software are first time buyers. I will never buy software from Amazon or Symantec again.
3,H. G. Wells' The Time Machine: Original Motion Picture Score,"At the end of the scene where the miniature Time Machine disappears there is a sound effect that was not included in this CD version. NOT GOOD. Very disappointing.The background strange and haunting other-worldly sound when George is with Weena in the garden, is also missing. That was one of the reasons I bought this CD. Should I return it?"
2,A big piece of junk,This is the second plasma I have owned. Do not buy this plasma. it is a great size. But the picture quality from dvd and digital cable was really poor black looks poor --artifacting The hum from this plasma is so loud that it can be heared over even med volume. It is the worst plasma i have seen to date.
4,Man C'mon. This is ridiculous!!!!,"I can't believe what I'm hearing. The essence of Hip-Hop still exists, and it's a beautiful thing. I would recommend this for meditation (yes, meditation), just chillin' at home, the drive home from work, date music, you name it. The tributes are the best to me, and the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because there is one song I just don't care for. I promise that if you are a 30-something that grew up listening to real hip hop (Not the crap that they are playing nowadays), you will not waste your money."
4,Too Short,Conrad Not at his best but still worth reading. Only downside is that the actual story is only 70 or so pages long. When you read Conrad you don't want the story to end. Half the book is taken up with forwards and introductions.
4,The Shadow-line : a war novel ?,"Many critics like to categorize novels, authors in boxes. My thought is that the Shadow-line is a novel apart. The first world war is obliquely alluded in this novel, like a Kurt Vonnegut did for the second world war in his Slaughter's house five. This is not the easier of Conrad's novel to read, though it looks like a bildungsroman at first glance. Other oblique subjects lye behind the plot and the words. A must-have !"
4,Crank the Windlass and set sail,"I enjoyed reading about the main characters experience of crossing the line from youthfulness into true adulthood. Conrad's eloquent, descriptive, and almost surreal writing style allows the reader to almost experience the stagnation, heat, and frustration that envelop the characters in this book. Perhaps not Conrad's best book, but certainly a good read, and it is quite short and to the point. Especially if you have an affinity for sailing and the power and majesty of the sailing vessels of old. I have always felt that there is a certain amount of effort required to enjoy Conrad's books, but I also feel that this, in a sense, is directly proportional to effort in life. The more you put in, the more you get out."
4,Gregg Karukas: Home for the Holidays,"I bought this CD on a whim and it was my best purchase for the season. Fine jazz Yuletide music. No bizarre versions of the classics here. The four original songs by Gregg Karukas and Shelby Flint are among the best on the CD. You won't have to hurriedly skip over any of the songs (well..., maybe Winter Wonderland), but all of the rest will help make your Christmas season the brighter. Surely a wonderfull addition to your Christmas collection."
5,A wonderful holiday musical trip.,"Although a fan of Greg Karukas, this holiday journey stands out as one of his best efforts. It has beautiful music and vocals with several unique holiday songs that simply round out the Christmas holiday feeling. This is a great addition to your musical collection, not just holiday collection."
4,Dangerous Dog,"Someone gave this toy to my son for his first birthday. Soon after the tail broke off. The tail is held on by a spring that was removed easily by my son. Once the tail is removed the end of the spring is revealed. The end of the metal spring is VERY sharp! Please, beware that this could easily cause harm to your child. I do not recommend this toy to anyone."
4,Satisfied customer,"I love this corelle pattern. I already have a set of it and needed another. One thing I was surprised to see, is that these pieces were made outside of the USA, where all of the corelle pieces that I already own are made in the USA. The color is a bit more orange, which I do not particularly like. I don't know if this has anything to do with where it was manufactured or not, but I am assuming so."
1,Damaged Goods,"Really didn't have to get out the boxcutter out, with all the rattling I heard...received with over 50% of dishes broken. Terribly packaged, with only air-filled plastic bags used for padding. Sent it back for refund, still haven't heard anything yet though.I have seen quite a few other reviews by customers who received broken dishes. I guess it is best to buy dishes from brick-and-mortars."
5,"Great for families with kids, and clumsy spouses","I love my Corelle. This is the 2nd set I've had in 10 years. The first (Hearts) set I ""handed down"" to my FIL who didn't want to spend money on a new set of dishes when he moved to his apartment. Since my original set was in nearly perfect condition, it was ideal for him. He still has it and uses it daily. My second set (Chutney)is used several times daily. I have a 3& 1/2 year old, who is very rough on these dishes and a spouse who is sometimes a bit rough, when loading/unloading the dishwasher. In 3 years, I have only ""lost"" one dish, due to minor chipping. The main reason I love Corelle is I microwave alot and these dishes can hold up to the microwave cooking day-in and day-out. I have heard that the ""new"" Corelle are being manufactured overseas and therefore are not made up to the standards of microwaving-I read they can explode??? However, I cannot verify this and have not had an incident in 3+ years of ownership (new dishes)."
3,Exploding Corelle Bowl,"I had a corelle bowl fall about 28 inches onto a formica countertop. It broke with a loud BOOM and threw fragments into two adjoining rooms. It did not just break, it turned into tiny needle-like shards that flew 20 feet."
3,Would love a Yankees Classic Uno set instead,"Let's face it - these sports-themed Uno sets have a short shelf life. Sports athletes get traded, sign ridiculously expensive new free agent contracts elsewhere or retire, within a year or two of your purchase. So, you can look at these as collector's items, if you like, but what works better are those sets, like Uno's New York Knicks basketball set, that take the long view approach - portraits of great team players from years gone by, as well as some of the current, long time veterans. More interesting and valuable would be a Yankees Uno set that included the Babe, Lou Gehrig, Joe D, Mickey Mantle, Roger Maris, Phil Rizzuto, Whitey Ford, Ron Guidry, Reggie Jackson, Goose Goosage, Don Mattingly, Mo Rivera, Derek Jeter & Bernie Williams - all players who achieved great fame as members of the Yankees.The design of the cards, though, is pleasing, mimicking the Yankee colors and pinstripes. The special Acquisition Card is a nice addition to the set, as well."
1,Why buy a beta?,"Don't buy it, it's full of bugs. And if you buy it, wait with installing the game until they have released all the patches.It crash often, the save games gets corrupted and worst of all, the uninstaller have been reported to making havoc with your windows register."
2,"Bad choice, horrible voice","My son got this for his first birthday. We forgot about it and had it in the closet and just took it out. He is now 2 and can easily shape sort, but he hates this toy. The shapes are so close to the size of the openings that they must fit exactly. He has very good motor skills and can do it, but looses interest fast. Also, I must say, the voice is horrible. It's a womans voice, and honestly, I hate to be crude, but the voice sounds very provocative. I am not the only one who feels this way, as a matter of fact it's a joke with my friends. When she talks she sounds very sexy....too weird for us. We are getting rid of this toy. I'm sorry but its true. Skip this toy, there are much better shape sorters out there. Do a search on amazon.com and you'll find some great shape sorters. Good luck."
5,Yummy Fun!!,"This toy was a big hit at our house. With two toddlers, this toy has gotten lots of use. It has stood up to the challenge of toddlers, and is still intriguing to my 3-year old who thinks of it as a coffee maker(Oh, well!?). My 1-year old is still trying to figure out how the shapes go, but it provides music and sounds even if shape sorting success has not been mastered. The volume control is an added bonus. I have found this to be one of the best toys in our house. I have purchased it as gift for the children of several friends and they love it too."
4,A Happy Child and Mommy,This toy is great! I was having difficulty with getting my child to use shape sorters which is a very good skill for low tone babies that might have fine motor skill issues. I am a Mother of such a child. She loves this toy because when you put the shapes in you get feedback. It is very durable and I would recommend this toy to anyone. I also think the price is good for what it is as well. You will not be sorry with this purchase. Enjoy!
5,It's all that it should be!,"I have read the reviews and decided to purchase for my 10 month old daughter! Of all the Christmas presents, she refuses to leave this one alone!The words are clear and it is so neat to hear it say ""heart"" and ""I love You.""I am glad I bought this toy! I read an unfavorable review and I am glad that I ignored it! Bravo Fisher Price! Very entertaining! I love Cookie Surprise!"
2,ONLY if you want trouble!!!!!,"I baught this for my 1 year old (now 18 months)and have had NOTHING but trouble! She takes the lid off and dumps all the pieces out then puts her hand inside and out through the holes and gets her hand stuck and the tar scared out of her because she can't get it back out. MORE trouble than it's worth, I have put it up where she can't get it. It is VERY durable however, it has withstood all the banging it has been put through on my coffee table!"
4,REally Impressed,"I got one of these as a gift for a friend's child, and was so impressed with it that I had to get one for my son. I love the music that it plays, and I like the fact that you can set it to teach numbers OR shapes. My son loves to watch the lights."
4,Great educational toy,"My 11 month old really likes to play with this toy, especially when I play with her. She is already learning to put the shapes through the sides, although she hasn't figured out which ones go where. When she gets frustrated, she can just put them in through the top and is rewarded by the music and she dances in place. She's also dropped it from the coffee table several times, and the toy is unaffected."
4,FAVORITE TOY!,"We bought this for our daughter when she was 6 mos. old. She loved to remove the lid and pick the blocks out and put them back in. Putting the blocks in on the sides took longer, but she tried early on around 9-10 mos. to do so. This was her favorite toy by far. I think the fact that it has a lid that comes off is what did it for her. She likes to take stuff out and put stuff in. She's now 15 mos. and is just now starting to grow out of this jar, but still pulls it out every now and then. You can't beat the price either!!!!"
5,Fun & Educational toy that grows with your child,"My daughter received this toy when she was 6 months old. She is now 2 1/2 and is still having loads of fun with it. This is a toy that will grow with your child because at the baby stage they will be fascinated with the lights and music. The lights and music are very simple for the baby to activate because all it requires is sticking their hand in the cookie jar, or pressing the nose of the jar. Once your baby grows to a toddler/child and are learning their shapes and colors the toy becomes not only fun but educational. This toy teaches colors, shapes and phrases such as ""I love you"", ""Yummy"" & ""Mmmmmm"".Excellent toy that will be in your child's toy box for years and years."
4,Good Shape Choice,"I bought this toy for my daughter for Christmas when she was 6 mos old. She liked the sounds it made and would bang the different shapes together which coordinated with her motor skills for that age and a little later she would put the shapes in and take them out. She didn't started REALLY trying to put the shapes into the openings until she was about 10 mos old. When she started putting the shapes thru the openings, she began holding them by the 'open end' of the shape and pushing them in. She was able to do each one but has trouble with the heart. The star for some reason seems to be her favorite. Each time she would get one in she would laugh and clap her hands. I like this toy because it teaches a variety of themes. The voice is cute and lyrical. Not robotic like a lot of toys. I would recommend this toy."
4,A Great Shape Sorter,"My 9-month-old son received this toy for Christmas, and he really likes it, especially taking the shapes out. The sound that's made when he puts he's hand in the cooking jar is exciting too.I like the sweet sounding voice used and the two different settings."
4,The great lost Time album,"This is an album I seem to drag out every 6 months or so. Something will remind me of it and I have to hear it again. I could easily do without the ""skit"" at the beginning but I suppose it's part of what makes The Time so special,their penchant for theatrics both audio and visual. However once the title track kicks in it's all good. Jesse Johnson is especially good on this album. Just listen to the solo on Skillet and you'll see what I mean. I wish this record had been a bigger hit for them.It might have persuaded them to keep the reunion going longer if it had been a bigger seller. I'm going to a State Fair tonight to see "" Morris Day and The Time "" and hopefully I'll hear some cuts from this album."
3,"Started out good,died towards the middle","Reunion? Yeah,I was hype. THE TIME in the 90's i-ight! Not such a good comeback though.Sure the originals are here. Morris,Jerome,Terry,Jimmy Jam,Jellybean,Jesse and Monte. But the new jack 90's wasn't doin' for THE TIME. Songs like ""Chocolate"" which is their sound couldn't get them funkateers from the early 80's back in the groove. Not even the so-called rappin' ""Jerk Out"" jerked them back. Ballads like ""Sometimes I Get Lonely"" is a ""Gigolos Get Lonely Too"" part two. ""It's Your World"",motivating but not moving and the attempt to crossover to rock like ""Jungle Love"" and ""777-9311"" did,THE TIME gets JESSE to rock on ""Blondie"" and ""Skillet"". Dust off ""My Drawers"" y'all. Oh,the stoopid skits inbetween the songs like ""Sexy Socialites"",for example,put an even more stamp on this downhill CD.It was great to see the 7 of them all together again. The effort was there but I guess it just wasn't their TIME. Oh,that was bad."
2,Quite Please!,"I bought this toy for my 6 1/2 month old daughter and it's one I actually regret! While the shape sorter is a good tool and she loves to grab and chew on the shapes, it makes the most annoying sound and it NEVER stops! The song was cute, but only about the first 20 times in 5 minutes! The button to make it sing is on the bottom so anytime your baby, or you move it it goes off. There's no way to turn it off and no volume. (it's very loud). We end up taking the batteries out. I don't recommend this unless you just happen to love the noise makers."
4,Snail Pail,We got this to go with a few other toys my daughter got for Christmas. We like it because it goes with the whirlin Twirlin Garden and the Fisher Price Activity Table. It can also be played on its own by sorting the different shapes in the holes and can be used alone to build with. It is a great toy for the price.
5,Fun for baby - not obnoxious for parents,"This toy was in anstant hit with my 8-month old. The blocks inside are unusual shapes and can be spun like a top, which fascinates her. (FYI - they're interchangable with some other Fisher-Price toys.) The best part, as far as I'm concerned, is the happy tune the snail plays. The song is up-beat enough for her to dance to (and she does - no matter where she is or what she's doing - she stops and bops to the tune), yet simple and jazzy enough to keep parents from wanting to throw it out the window on the umpteenth playing. So many 'musical' toys try to amuse the child by overwhelming them with techno beats or whooping screeches. This little guy delights my daughter with his simple tasteful tune, and his little song is a welcome addition to our home."
5,a GREAT toy... if you take the batteries out!,we got this for our son when he was 4 months old. At first all he did was make it play the music and hit the shell part of it. now at almost 11 months he plays w/ this toy every day. We especially like the way you can use the base for a stacker. He loves to stack the shapes and then knock them over. The music was so obnoxious that we had to remove the batteries so it wouldn't play music anymore. But it is still one of his favorites
4,A Little Annoying!,"The same short tune plays over and over, even when you don't want it to---the button for the music is on the bottom part of the toy, so even if the top is bumped it starts up. No off button and no volume. The shape sorter is okay, but it doesn't offer ""normal"" shapes, so there isn't the learning of square, circle, star, triangle, etc. Overall my daughter (18m) enjoys it, but it doesn't get played with too often."
3,Doesn't make sense,"My 9 month old daughter got this as a gift at 4 months. She loves the music and knows where the button is to activate it. She likes chewing on the shapes. She just opens the lid up to pull them out and put them back, because the sorter is too hard for her and she just doesn't bother with it when she can open the lid so easily. And we never figured out the purpose of the snail head coming off???? But despite my issues with it, she seems to like playing with it."
3,Well at least it's cute......,"My daugher got this as a gift when she turned one. She doesn't seem to be very interested in it. She did though figure out that if you push the button on the bottom it plays the ""fun"" music. I (unlike most parents who rated this item) don't find the music annoying, but hey maybe my daughter is not playing with this toy as much as other children. She likes throwing the shapes in and out of the snail and taking of the head, but doesn't care for the sorter as she still can't sort them correctly."
3,This is a great toy,"My one year old son is in theraphy, and his therapist is the one that got me addicted to this toy. My son tries to put the shapes in the right hole, but the good thing if he seems to not be able to get it in the hole he knows he can open it and just throw it in. So for kids I think that is a great quality, since keeds can get frustrated easy. This was they are always winners. I do recomind this toy, but I can say that the music on the base it very touchy, so that can drive the parents nuts..."
4,Baby loves the music,"We received this as a baby shower gift--our baby (3 months) is just now getting old enough to start enjoying it (with a little help from us). Of course, she's still not old enough to insert the shapes into the snail's shell.Nevertheless, he bright colors and the music keep her entertained. It remains to be seen how long the batteries will last...it uses the small ""button"" batteries, not standard AA or AAA batteries."
3,pros and cons,"Reasons I don't like this toy:1. The head comes off for no reason that I can see2. Only one song, which plays over and over as the child plays wit it3. No off switch or volume control4. Door seems to be flimsyReasons I do like this toy:1. Pieces interchange with Fisher Price play table"
1,Too noisy and no volume control,"My sons never had much of a chance to play with this toy because I found it too loud, and the song very annoying. There is no volume control, and the song drove me nuts. This may be a great sorting toy but I wouldn't know. I always took the toy away because of the racket."
4,Needs an off button,"Love this toy...but after you hear the song (loud) that it plays for the millionth time you're ready to hide it for awhile. It is really cute, but it needs an off switch."
3,fun shapes.,"this is a fun introduction to shape sorting toys. 3 fun shapes to easily put in the large openings. The chunky shapes are large and colorful, and easy to grasp. But the loud song gets annoying when the kids play it over and over. Must be why grandma gave it away! My daughter loves putting the shapes in so this was a great toy for us."
2,Annoying toy alert,"This is probably the toy I like the least out of all my daughter's toys. It plays an anoying song- frequently and loudly and because of it's tall slim design and heavy base it is hard for her to handle. The only thing that is good about this toy vs. other, better, shape sorters is that the blocks can be used with other toys in the line."
5,Very nice toy,I received this as a gift for my daughter at 11 months of age and she loved this! Five months later and she still plays with it a great deal. She has alot of toys so the fact that she keeps going back to this one says alot. I just bought this my friends child and will probably but more as gifts in the future. It is a great toy!
4,COMPLEX FOR LITTLE FINGERS,"Plays a cute tune and is ""cute as a bug"", however found with both kids a little complex for little ones. The door hinges are not very durable for clumsy infants. The holding value was the music and chewing and holding the shapes. I didn't see any sorting going on until 2 years old. Stacking became a big game also at that age. They do stack well."
4,Learning more about our limits as we we teach Catholocism,This book is a great reference and will keep you out of trouble.....many questions arise about the Catholic faith and this clears the air...no question..a must for your Catholic library.
4,illustrations disappointing,"THe same child-centric text that entranced my daughter 30 years ago, and other people's daughters 30 years before that, and the same fur-covered binding that appealed to them, but in a format 3 to 4 times the size. Easier for grown-ups to hold, not so much fun for children. But compared with the reprinted original version, the color in the illustrations is a real disappointment (dark and dreary, reminded me of rotting vegetables)."
2,"Not for me, but my daughter likes it okay","I really like Margaret Wise Brown's other books, so I was excited to receive this one as a gift. I'd never heard of it before, and now I kind of see why. The writing and story are quite different than Runaway Bunny or Goodnight Moon. Like another reviewer, I found the repetition of the ""fur"" theme to be a bit much. Also, the story is rather random and weird, with the child wandering ""dark and sunny woods,"" grabbing various creatures and examining them or ""kissing them on their little fur nose."" I also find the illustrations, while well done, to be slightly sinister and creepy, with the forbidding-appearing woods, the red and wind-whipped depiction of evening, and the odd-looking ""fur father."" I hate to rain on everyone's childhood memories, but there you have it. Our two-year-old daughter likes it okay, and it's slowly making its way into regular circulation in her library."
2,"It may be a classic, but it doesn't interest everyone...","We received this as a present for our daughter, and our first thought was ""How adorable!"" The box set is very cute, and the brown fur covered book is certainly attractive to a child's curious little fingers, but that is where it ends for us.Our daughter enjoys petting and pulling the fur, but the story and illustrations do not hold her attention. Even the sounds (kerchoo, thump, kerplunk, ssip, etc.) didn't catch her attention as they usually do. The illustrations are softer than most children's books and are not eye catching.Plus, my husband and I found the story to be a bit weird. The ""fur child,"" ""fur world,"" ""fur mother,"" ""fur grandson"" and other ""fur"" references were a little much. The fact that this ""Fur Family"" wears fur coats was also a tad unsettling.Does this mean the book isn't worth buying? For us it's not worth it since my daughter doesn't enjoy it and neither do we, but I'm sure others would appreciate the classic."
5,My Favorite,"I am 40 years old now and can't remember when I couldn't read. I have been an avid book collector all my life. This is one of my favorites. I found this to have action and adventure, mixed with cuddly and cute. I have my original copy from the 60's as well as a new one ordered from Amazon.com. I think the illustrations are wonderful. I can close my eyes and be in the forest with the Little Fur Family any time. Wonderful for children of all ages."
3,Cliche For Now...,"...but had I read it when I originally bought it back in 1989 (it's now 2004)!, it would've taken my breath away! I just finished reading this book and although I enjoyed it and it was quite the page turner, for nowadays, it simply came off as cliche! The rugged man, the waif of a damsel in distress...typical Dynasty-esque but at the time it was written I could totally understand how it would go over well! All in all, though, I thoroughly enjoyed it --- even if I did find myself rolling my eyes every now and then!"
3,page turner with errors,"I like all of Sujata Massey's books I have read (so far have read the first 3) - they are all quick moving and good escapist reading. She has quite a few improbable scenes and a plot line that stretches credibility, but the overall enjoyment she offers outweighs these difficulties. I was surprised by this one though that she has so many glaring errors. She states that in Japanese Buddhism women are not allowed to be priests - I personally have met 3 women Buddhist priests in Japan. One is the heir to the title of abbot of a family-run Buddhist temple. This means that one of the central devices of her plot is incorrect - that the young woman Akemi can't inherit the title of abbot of her family's temple.Other than that there are some basic flaws in her explanation of Buddhism (what a sutra is, what Pali is, etc..) These things should have been caught by the editors.Still I do recommend this as a fun read, if you don't believe it as actual Japanese culture."
1,Lousy story wrapped in a furoshiki,"There are some nice Japanese culture tidbits in this book but overall there's not much going on here....Weak, cardboard like secondary characters, wildly erratic behavior by main character. The plot bounces around too much and since you don't have too much attachment to the characters, you really don't care where they end up. Character dialogue is weak at times and jerky...I frequently felt like I had missed a sentence or two but it was just poor dialogue. It's been a long time since I've read a book that I thought it better to throw out than to possible burden another human being with a story of such lacking. You'd be better off to read some real Japanese mysteries by Miyuki Miyabe or Akimitsu Takagi than this Gaijin-lite stuff. ..."
3,Missed opportunity,"The second in Massey's series is a disappointment. Her heroine, Rei, behaves erratically throughout, making for puzzling psychology. Things fall apart, the center cannot hold. It's hard to figure out why Rei does what she does, and while the mystery plot line holds together, the character does not."
4,Great Adaption,"There have been many adaptations to the story ""How the Turtle Got Its Shell"" and this is one of my favorites. I read the book to my 1st grade class and they loved it."
3,I enjoyed it,"If you are looking for a book about a SAS commando with stories of intrigue then this is not the book for you. If you are looking for a love relationship between two people who are supposed to be enemies, I highly recommend it. This story tears at your heart strings and makes you question who's side you're on."
1,Ring of truth missing,"This book doesn't work for me, and I have read a few. Probably would have been a great Mills & Boon had it not been so gratuitously violent. The contrived violence is a mask used in an attempt to validate what is most obviously fiction. There is no credibility. Nothing is delivered in this novel that cannot be garnered in the public domain or with a little research. It sits on my shelf alongside another book that defies all reality, i.e. OPJB, a work of complete and utter nonsense. A total waste of time for anyone interested in the real world. It is a fantasy probably perfect for lower end television grist-mill."
2,ok,"The writing is fairly pedestrian and the author fails to really capture the reader. The book deals more with the number of times the two characters got together than with the politics of N. Ireland.Even thought the writer is a former SAS soldier, he reports one atrocity of the British in Northern Ireland but fails to truely acknowledge the discrimination or convey the deep divisions found here."
5,GREAT for ideas,This is such a great book for Speech teachers!! It is very informational and has some unique and FUN activities you can do with the students. I would strongly recommend to anyone who wants/needs ideas for the speech classroom!
4,A winner with both Sinatra and Dorsey,"Early Sinatra from his days as a Big Band singer plus the smooth trombone of Dorsey are on this album. Sinatra credited his musical phrasing from the time he spent with the Dorsey band. Great selections, great band and great singer."
5,Fabulous,"Ruth Cox knows more about YA literature than seems possible. She shares her joy and knowledge of books with humor, insight and a desire to make young people love books as much as she does. Dont miss anything that this woman does--it is all worhtwhile!"
2,it that all there is,"only 8 tracks and 26 minutes. is that the best vanguard could come upwith. worse yet four of the tracks are poor live recordings. pass this one upunless you need rooftop singers ""walk right in"" a hard to find selection."
2,Forgot how great this one was. Shipping sucked.,"I had this disk in the 90s, when it came out. Forgot how much fun it was to listen to. Unfortunately, shipping took 3 days longer than it was supposed to. Really frustrating to sit and wait, wondering if Amazon took your money and ran."
5,"""COP KILLER""","This is by far the best hard core cd out there. If you hate cops this is your cd. I've got the original with ""cop killer"" on it, and I suggest that you get it instead of the censored version. GOOD HUNTING HA HA HA!"
3,Cop Killer,"the reason that i only give this cd 3 stars is that it missing its main song (Cop Killer) iv had this album back in the day on cassette and it was the days when greedy bustards didnt delete songs to cash in like they do now, bring back the real deal bring back this album with all the original tracks that Ice mf T worked on"
4,South Central knows how to ROCK,"I picked up this album knowing full well that it was Ice-T in a metal band. I loved that concept. Then when i found ou that the entire band was from South Central, I was equally impressed. I was impressed still when i found out how great the band ACTUALLY IS. They rock hard and, on ""The Winner Loses,"" show that they have a heart as Ice-T solemnly sings about a friend who was brought down by cocaine. The bottom line is that this album is VERY AGGRESSIVE. The lyrics are like a rabid german shepard, they bite into you and don't let go. If you want music that is going to stick with you and just all out rock, this is an essential album for your archives."
4,it would be five stars... but...,"first of all i love this cd, i bought it back in 1993 and i'm listening to it since then. this os one of the first metal/rap fusions, and i prefer it the ratm album, which was released in the same year. one major drawback of this release is that it is censored. i own the original version, with ""cop killer"" on it, and this song just rocks! i recommend this cd anyway to any metal or rap fan, but i recommend even more to try to get the original. but back to the music... the riffing is pretty cool, although the guitar solos are not very well played. ice-t's rapping is very good though, the lyrics fit perfectly to the music"
4,Hardcore... for a reason,"I bought this CD the week it came out because I was a big fan of ICE-T and metal music. I was not disappointed. I think that part of the reason for making this album was to expose ICE-T to the middle-class white kids... and it worked. Not only does this album totally rock, but it has a message as well. I highly recommend it if you can find the original, uncensored version."
4,"""Ice-T"" rocks!","You've got to give ""Ice-T"" credit. After he became the O.G. of the rap game, he went and put together a rap-metal band. I wont say this album started any kind of movement, but it is one of the early groups of the genre. This of course had all the ""Cop Killer"" controversy in 1992, and the track was eventually removed. The funny thing is how hardcore alot of the other lyrics are, so I guess it's ok to kill your own mother, just not cops. Anyway, even without that track, it's still a killer album. ""Ice"" even tries singing on ""The Winner Loses"", which is a really cool, ballad type song. Overall, it's a really good album, and a real sign of the times."
4,Needs to be taken in the context of it's time,"Raw is the one word that I would use to describe this record - raw production values, raw lyrics, raw attitude.When this album came out, the Rodney King incident and the L.A. Riots had just occurred. If there was one record that could freeze the feelings of that time, this would qualify. The music is loud, fast, sloppily played at times, profane, and angry, and it leaps right out of the speakers at you. The songs feel like they were each written under 5 minutes during someones bender - yet somehow the chaos of it all works in the end.Anyone who likes to hear true grass-roots revolution-rock, punk like Black Flag, The Mentors, Atari Teenage Riot, etc. - probably will enjoy this album. Metallica fans - it's not for you."
5,I love this book! But add a caution regarding young readers,"This series is amazing-- I love it! The author/illustrator collaboration is really special. I even ordered two books from the United Kingdom Amazon because they won't be published here for a few more months. :)A caution: some of the Edge Chronicles are very dark/have imagery which may be too disturbing for young readers. (For example, an earlier book features a serial killer who chops off the toes of his victims and keeps them in a massive pile! Yikes! A chilling moment for readers.) This book is the first of 3 volumes which follow the story of Rook Barkwater, a young librarian knight. The Rook Barkwater books seemed less disturbing to me than some of the earlier books. They are really enjoyable, full of endearing characters and heroism. So... if your kids are old enough, you may really enjoy reading the Edge Chonicles together."
3,A Startling Change,"In the fifth installment of the Edge Chronicles, The Last of the Sky Pirates, the story continues with Rook Barkwater, a librarian. Chosen for a quest by the librarian knights, he must travel across the land to reach his goal, along with two other companions. I found the sudden shift of characters both abrupt and irritating. I had been looking forward to Twig's future, but instead Stewart brought about Twig's downfall and started a new character. Though I found this sequel disappointing, the plot does seem to have the usual ""dose"" that Stewart injects into his books. There's plenty of action and adventure to keep the reader occupied."
4,Good Value,These are excellent beginning bonsai tools at a VERY reasonable price. Are they the equiv of a $200 tool set? No. However they are an excellent value for the price. You will need to take care of these to a greater degree than the hire price tools or they may rust. Keep them clean and oiled and they should give you many years of service. I have not used all the tools but the ones I have used are sharp and retain their edge well.
5,Great classic Christmas carols,"I picked up this CD many years ago in the check-out aisle of a store (whose name I have forgotten), but despite the modest beginning it has become one of my favorite holiday albums of all time. It's full of classic Christmas carols with impeccable choral singing and arrangements. No pop songs here: the Roger Wagner Chorale is old-school singing at it's best for those times you just want a solid classic holiday album. I can't recommend it enough, and it makes an ideal soundtrack to the season!"
4,Gundam at its finest!!,"An excellent book. This story is what got me into the Gundam storyline. Even though it is part of a three book set, it brings you up to speed and can stand alone."
1,plastic phone,"poor choice on my part.phone was plastic, never mentioned that in any of the product information"
1,"Vista Walker, Propet M3910","The shoe size is all wrong. I ordered size 10D, the size must be for some other country. The size I received was more like 9D. Would like to send shoes back."
4,Great Deal on Walking Shoes.,"These are very comfortable shoes and well worth the price. The laces were a bit too long, which is a slight annoyance, but had no adverse affect on the great comfort and fit."
1,Disapointing,"The Rolling Stones made many great tunes. I ordered the CD because of the Scorsese name. The CD is c**p. I remembered hearing a tune from ""Voodo Lounge"" which I haven't found yet. I figure it's worth a try. These guys are past hanging it up. Their age does not override the young voices in this case. They may try to emulate the energy of years gone by, but it's in the music. It's just not the same. For the first time, Scorsese disapointed me, as he's pretty good in his filming. I go for the music. Just maybe, in pushing technololgy, the DVD may be great [as Led Zepplin's ""No quarter"" was] but the CD is crap. I'm old and know some groups of reknown. The CD doesn't cut it."
1,Worst Ever DVD,"I expected more, a lot more. I don't how anyone can like this DVD.Martin Scorsese's DVD about ""The Band"" in the DVD titled ""The Last Waltz"" was 100 times better this DVD ""Shine a Light"".The guitars sounded out of tune and there was no bass in the music. Sounded like a teenage garage band.Big Dud for me.BC"
1,Absolut rubbish,"I love the Stones, especially live but..............the sound field is terrible and varies with the camera positions. And every band plays a few wrong notes - with is video being restricted to one concert there are a few. The Start Me Up (my favourite song)openning rift is so bad even Keith acknowledges it to the camera. I am truely disappointed about buying this one. And why did the Stones limit this to only one concert - they could have picked the best of a few and created history (The Band they are not)."
2,Disappointing,"After having known Scorsese's earlier work like ""Last Waltz"" and recently ""No Direction Home - Bob Dylan"", I expected ""Shine a light"" to be of a similar standard. But it's mostly damp squib with the entire movie being about just one concert (all songs shown are played fully) with very few titbits from backstage and fewer clips from Stones' earlier years. This is not a documentary on the Rolling Stones but rather an extended dvd of one concert. Nothing really stands out here. All in all very avoidable. Hugely disappointing as earlier works like ""The Last Waltz"" and ""No Direction Home"" are like collectibles that can be watched several times over the years with their timeless quality...""Shine a Light"" is nowhere near that..one watch and you can toss it in the bin...oh well..."
3,Any other band this sloppy couldn't get away with it,"I've never been an overly huge fan of the Stones because I've never been that big on the guitar players, but to me they sound sloppier than ever. They tortured ""Undercover of the Night"", one of my favorite Stones studio recordings, and the cavalcade of wrong notes emanating from the guitars is too much to take. Highlight would be Buddy Guy's appearance if there is one."
1,I'm sure this product is great if I would ever receive it,I'm so tired of repo steam these reviews because they don't meet these guidelines.I really want to like this just wish you would show up
3,It's the Stones! And Scorsese! But...,"This concert is fantastic - yes, the Stones are getting up there but it's refreshing to see these guys having fun in their latter years.It's no secret that Scorsese is a huge Stones fan - their music is featured in many of his films. But the way this concert is shot is a little strange...the sound is highlighted in the shot. So if Keith Richards is featured on the screen, you primarily hear his guitar. If it's Charlie Watts, you hear his drums. Not just a little louder than the rest of the music...like the rest of the band is in the background. Maybe there's a way to turn this off? The soundtrack doesn't do this.Overall, the Blu-ray is very clear, the setlist is great, the featured artists like Jack White are cool, but Scorsese's attempt to reinvent the live-concert-film wheel takes it down a couple notches. Give it a rent before you buy."
5,Yeah Babeeee!,What's not to love. Rock and roll at its finest with Martin S. at the visual helm. I love the juxtaposition of the historical clips interposed with the present conversations and performance. The Stones have lost nothing with time but sure as hell have made experience enhance their performances. Great fun to watch Keith perform a solo and act amazed that everyone loved it. This is a get out your credit card and don't ask questions kind of DVD.
5,Sounding Terrific,"What Fun to Watch the Stones do their thing! Never been a huge fan, never seen them live but now I feel like I've been missing out and will get there for sure now if I get the chance. Filming was excellent, great variety of music, what a showman Jagger is!!!!"
3,Why did Scorsese direct this?,"First off, I am a world class Stones fan. I am also a Scorsese fan. I don't see what this great director added to the Stones legacy. There are plenty of Rolling Stones concerts from the last twenty years on DVD. The last two tours were heavily documented by the Stones themselves. This production is nothing special. I think some of the concerts filmed by the Stones are better. The only thing to sell this particular product with is the inclusion of songs not previously on DVD, such as Tears Go By and She Was Hot. Jack White's duet was not particularly good. Christina Aguilera's was better, and Buddy Guy was probably the best of the star turns. But this is not riveting stuff. The fans need a more historical documentary, since 25X5 has never been issued on DVD. There has to be a ton of interesting footage from Brian Jones onward. Go ask Bill Wyman, he's probably got the motherlode squirreled away. As for 'Shine A Light', I don't get it. What did Martin Scorsese add?"
5,The Stones at their BEST,"Shine a Light has everything a Stones fan could want. Being behind the scenes with Martin Scorsese and feeling like being onstage with the boys, one couldn't ask for a better concert album. Love it."
4,"Muy bueno, pero...","Muy bueno pero creo que siendo probablemente el último documental de un concierto en vivo, debieron interpretar más clasicos de los Stones. No obstante, es un valioso documento que perpetuará una historia fantástica que lamentablemente ha de terminar algún día, para convertirse en leyenda."
2,blu-ray quality control issues,"Apart from a slow start, I thought this was an excellent concert film, as would be expected from Martin Scorsese, with first-rate image quality and sound. The Stones were in fine form at this concert - showing unflagging energy and spirit. My problem with the Blu-Ray is quality control - my copy (not from Amazon, but a respectable source) had a defect in Faraway Eyes, which caused it to stop and fail to play the following track at all (with Buddy Guy). Two subsequent exchanges both had exactly the same problem, both on my Oppo player and the store's PS3, indicating a pressing defect not visible to the eye. After the third try, I gave up and bought something else. My review is an average of 4 stars for the film and none for the pressing. May, 2011 update: I found copies at two more stores and insisted on trying them before paying. Both had the same defect, so I am now 0 for 5 tries. There is no way I would get this mail-order."
2,stones outta my district 4,"I really enjoy the Stones, have been a fan since their very beginning. even saw them in a small Club in 1962, I think. However when I purchased the DVD from a source in the USA giving my Australian address for it to be sent to me, I foolishly immagined the disk would be in a format for my world region which is 4. So I can't play the disk on my DVD player but only on my PC. My wife thinks that is good. However in this age of world internet sales, the vendor has put themselves off my buy list."
2,Where is the sound?,After 50 years of listening to Rock and Roll it was a great let down to get sound quality from the 50's. Rock and Roll is all about the sound! Did they forget to plug in the bass player? No depth to the sound track at all. My mid-sixties original copy (in mono)of the Stones first US release (The Rolling Stones: England's Newest Hitmakers) is far superior in sound quality than this waste of money. The bands at my local live music venue make better sounding cd's in their garage.Shine a Light
3,everybody listen to me carefully,i am looking for the emotional rescue video without any thermo shots at all. i want the full version of the stones performing without the thermo shots. i have seen it on you tube but they took it off. i do not know the reason for this. why dont they release the version without the thermo shots. the version without the thermo shots was excellent. the best performance by the rolling stones i ever saw. i want this on dvd please release this. thank you
4,Shine a Light,As expected the video was great. Unfortunately the song list could have been a lot better. It's worth it just to see the Stones still doing it.
4,pretty good movie,"I saw this movie in an IMAX theater when it was released. This is not that movie. It is almost all the same songs, probably from the other night of 2 show run. still a good movie. the sound mix is different. volume up on whomever is playing lead riff. interesting at times, not so much at others."
1,Technical Issues,"The disc played in my Samsung Blu Ray player with great difficulty. At 11:19 it kept locking up, so I had to skip those chapters in order to see the concert. The menu caused my player, a Samsung with all the latest firmware upgrades, to lock up. Chapter selection was unavailable as were the extras. Why did they even ship this knowing full well it would not function with Blu Ray players- see other reviews about this as well. I am not the only one having problems with the bluray version."
2,Disappointed,I expected more with the professional production of a legend. I wanted more music and less commentary. I would not have minded the commentary if it was relevant and limited... targeted to enhance the musical journey.
2,Dud,"I bought this item expecting something along the lines of "" The Last Waltz."" What I got was a dud. It's just another concert dvd at best. The vocals are too loud, so you dont hear the music very well. Jagger is dancing around so much, his vocals fall out of tune; Jack Whites does as well. No in depth look into ""The Rolling Stones,"" like you see on ""The Last Waltz,"" just some music, old footage. It was dull and old."
1,Shine a Light on Blu-Ray,"I have purchased two copies of ""Shine a Light"" on Blu-Ray and both will not play past 1:00:29 on a SONY BDP-S470. The program freezes. I've made sure the firmware is updated and I've tried them on other players, so I know it is not a player problem. I would like to hear from anyone who has solved the problem."
5,Excelent!!,Excelent!! The sound is first class! Great camera work. The songs selection was perfect. The best band in the world!!!
3,You get what you need...,"Well into his 60's, Mick remains a true rockstar... an immensely talented and amazingly athletic explosion of raw energy. In a polished performance (re-lived countless times over nearly half a century) the Stones still look like they're having fun. The beat is solid, the songs are tight and these old men make it look easy. Watch it and enjoy it. It can't last --time catches up with us all."
3,A Dull Show,"The music itself is col enough, but the audio is totaly flat and without punch, almost no bass at all (tha bassdrum is nowhere to be heard). the band is almost always lit up with amber (skintone) lights.David Gilmour: Remember That Night - Live At The Royal Albert Hall [Blu-ray] Is way better in the audiovisual parts of the show. however, this is a gem for stones fans"
3,doesnt live up to the hype,"The Stones playing a small venue..sounds great....filmed and directed by Martin S!....how can you miss??!First, its not a nice casual live setting with a night of the Rolling Stones that has a nice, close up type feel. Instead it's a small venue thats packed and all you see is hands up in the air and the band with such a small space to play, treating it still like its a stadium. Going from B+W to color and back is BS.It's ok to watch because it is the Stones, but I'd take any day over this ""Live at the Max"" or even the 1982 film ""Lets Spend the Night Together""."
4,OK.....But.....,"One thing which has been (surprisingly) overlooked in the many reviews here is the fact that Mick was obviously in poor vocal shape at the time of the filming. He can't hit the high notes or hold a note, particularly in the earlier part of the concert. He has to resort to half talking/half singing and sounds somewhat like a rather poor Mick Jagger imitator.One plus of this is that you can actually make out the words to the lyrics when he's in this mode.Later in the concert he loosens up a bit vocally, but never reaches the 'normal' Mick sound.Keith gets a couple of vocals and has never sounded better, IMHO. His usually reedy, thin voice has some uumph this time out.I've got the Bridges to Bablyon DVD and IMAX and I would rate this one 3rd after IMAX and Bridges.I'll update this after I receive the Four Flicks and Biggest Bang DVD's"
4,Nice guitar,This is a very nice starter guitar. My 5 year old daughter loves to play it. It does not provide loops for straps and the cover/carrier it comes with has already broken. But the guitar itself is excellent.
4,Good beginner model!,Got this for my daughter's birthday. She loves it. Decent sound and holds tune pretty well. Very satisfied with the money that I spent!
4,music,"i am enjoying the product. it is the perfect size for me. so it is very user friendly. i am looking forward to getting alot of use out of it, because i am a music teacher."
4,Great for my daughter.,"This shipped very fast, and it was packed very well. It's perfect for someone just learning the basics, and the color says pink but it is mainly red I would say; but it is beautiful. The one problem is that we have to tune it a lot, but it's still great for a beginner, and the perfect gift from Santa...shhhh."
3,Only so so,"On the very first day - of Christmas - this guitar popped a string from the simple strum of a 6 year old, today it popped another one, putting my daughter into frustrated tears. The sound is pretty good but it does go out of tune very easily. All in all a bit of a disappointment."
1,Difficult to buy a musical instrument online I suppose...,"The nut was too low on the guitar causing nothing but BUZZ, BUZZ, BUZZ. This was a Christmas present for my eight-year-old daughter, and I was disappointed for her even though she tried to act like she liked it. The company who makes this thing should do better quality control. Anybody would have known this particular one was no good. In the twelve years I've been ordering things from Amazon this is my first disappointment. I had good luck with a ukulele I ordered through Amazon but will probably not order instruments online again. By the way, I went to a local music store two days after Christmas and we picked out a great-sounding starter guitar that she loves!"
1,Not at all Pink,"My 6 year old had been asking for her first guitar for a year, and it just HAD to be pink. You'd think ""Pink Burst"" would be pink, but it was absolutely NOT. The guitar was practically red around the edges, fading to salmony orange through the center of the body. Yuck! It was nothing at all like the online picture, nor any other online photos of ""pink burst"" guitars I could find. Luckily Sam Ash was happy to take it back and replace it in time for my daughter's birthday, and we got a true ""bright pink"" guitar. So, I give Sam Ash 5 stars, but this ""pink burst"" colored guitar is a zero - pink is everything to a six year old girl!"
2,Questionable Quality,"I like the way this product saves space, because I travel frequently and have to carry everything in my laptop case. I used the cable for connecting my laptop to my cell phone. I've owned two of these cables. The first one worked for about six months and the stopped working. I chalked that up to bad luck and purchased another one because I was overall pleased with the cable. The second one never worked. Data transfer did not work, and the cable would not retract.In the end, I purchased a regular USB cable which works great, but is not as compact as this product.I cannot recommend this product."
2,Strong language for a PG rating!,"My kids ages 10 and 12 love movies by hayao Miyazaki, ""howl's moving castle"" etc. So I thought this might be a good fit for them. However, I am appalled by the use of curse words throughout the movie. Guess I was wrong in choosing this. So I just thought I should let others know incase they make the same mistake!"
5,couldn't stop watching,I though this movie was great. The story was a blast to watch. After i finished watching the first time I had to watch it again so i pushed play one more time.
5,"A journey of pure fun, heart, and pulse pounding entertainment.","I cannot recommend this title highly enough. The visuals are stunning, especially in the OZ sequences and equal for the real world. The story, equally as well done, will keep you watching until the very end. The movie is a great adventure for those seeking a thought provoking and fun title to entertain whenever you watch. Don't pass up this title!"
5,Love this movie,One of the best feature length animes. I really enjoy it. It came in perfect shape and timely during the Christmas season too!
5,Awesome Movie,"This is a awesome movie. I watched it with about 10 friends and they absolutely loved the movie. They really got into the movie, which is hard for die hard anime fans to do, especially with a DVD movie. I would definitely watch the movie in the Japanese with English subtitles.The movie does start off a bit slow, but it starts moving faster and faster. I want to say that it is probably the best movie, I have seen in the past 2-3 years."
5,Great Anime Movie; Just Like Digimon,"This movie is the equivalent to the Digimon Movie; just with a bit less action and more of a focus on story & drama/emotions. I still have an attachment to Digmon the Movie, but this has just as much re-watch value; never getting tired of the awesome dialogue & art style! I'd recommend this to anyone; especially younger children."
4,Hollywood and anime clichés drag down the movie,"The first glimpse of this movie, I was expecting another great anime from Japan-it was delivered with great story telling, animation, and emotional draw that leaves any movie fan not just anime wanting more. The movie tells a story of High school teenagers who through angst, family commitment, and power overcome obstacles together through shared experiences and of course social networking. Think of FaceBook taking over the world in an official sense, but a hack breaks it, causing the world to collapse. The only downside to this well delivered drama is that at times it's marred with Hollywood and anime clichés; these distractions remove the viewer from focusing on the plot at hand, and at certain moments the character development. Yet, that would be the only thing that I could lament that hurts the film- at best. As whole, it is still a great film that any anime and non anime lover will enjoy."
5,Summer Wars,"This is a wonderfully made animated movie that I've been in love with ever since I saw it in 2010.I feel ashamed it has took more than 2 years for me to get off my butt and finally purchase it, but I have it now and its a wonderful piece to own."
5,I love this story,"This story is nothing far from our technology days, actually we are dependents of the Internet, that's the reason why this story can be possible, I hope don't occurs but it's possible...!"
5,"Great Story, Great Characters, Lots of Laughs.","This movie is excellent it doesn't go by too fast nor is it slow. If you want to watch a movie that will make you laugh and smile the whole way through, then this is just for you."
3,Very similar to Digimon: The Movie,"I was expecting nonstop action, explosions, flashes of color and all that fun stuff. But it's actually more of a slow movie, so I was a little disappointed. It was also very similar to Digimon: The Movie, in that people go into the Internet and fight a bad guy.I'd recommend watching it, but I wouldn't really recommend buying it."
5,love everything about this movie,"This is a great movie so far this year. i love the animation, blue-ray version is much better than the DVD, and the story is fresh. THUMB up if you love it."
5,Best movie ever,"I'm a mathematician myself, so i might be biased, but having the main character as a mathematician was pretty cool, as well as the use of hanafuda in the story. Its a great family movie and even non-anime fans will enjoy the detailed animation and deep story telling."
4,Suprisingly fun,"The only reason that I picked this anime up was because people kept nagging me to. Then I watched it, and it totally wasn't what I had been expecting. It was entertaining, stunningly so, and it had all the criteria for a good anime movie. It had action, cool battles, and some sort of mortal peril for the main characters. It also had humor, and heartwarming moments, giving the movie a feeling of substance. I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a good movie, not just anime fans, I believe this is one that anyone can enjoy. If I had to describe this movie, I would call it a well-rounded movie that almost everyone would love. It has a hard, and probably true, commentary of how the world is headed (not gonna give spoilers), lovingly wrapped in all the fun and frivolity of anime. Two thumbs up."
5,Reminder of the end of the world by internet technology lol,"I already loved this movie for lots of reasons. Then my boyfriend got it for me for my birthday. Yay!!!The story is of a young couple, well almost a couple, of teens along with the girl's huge family save the world from being attacked by the evil internet virus Love Machine."
5,Top 3 animated movie IMO,"On par with most Studio Ghibli movies, this fun and imaginative title comes from the same creator/director who brought us ""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"" which is another fantastic film. The colours are vivid and the story is enthralling, but what captivated me the most was the incredible music combined with beautiful animation. Definitely a must watch if you're a fan of animated movies."
2,Repetitive,"Adler offers few fresh insights in this sequel to ""Understanding Human Nature"" as it mostly repeats his concepts of inferiority feelings and social feeling. In fact, one of the later chapters lifts sections of the first book word for word. Moreover, Adler veers into prejudice in his ardent promotion of social cooperation by suggesting single people or those without children are failing to meet their obligations to contribute to society. He also misattributes homosexuality to attachment issues. His first book is a classic - among the best I've ever read on psychology. This one is better left in the 1930s."
3,life of a boxer,i dont agree with everything that the author has written here but the book is well structured and offers a point of view.
5,"It must be good, It's my cousin.","I have not yet had the opportunity to get my hands on this cd. But, it has to be good because my cousin is in the band! I remember a long time ago, we got drunk and listened to 'tool' together for hours... need I say more? Yes, I am ordering the cd and then i will listen to it and then I will give another review. SHOW ME YOUR METAL, ALLEN!"
4,"Content great, but is this a value buy???","I'll keep it brief as i am an echo of most others who have reviewed. I loved the content and thought it was top tier for a short arc. However, in terms of pricing for the product - i was definitely underwhelmed in comparison to previous installments. Accepting that for whatever reason we have gone from 13 episodes per installment to 12 with no pricing change, I was really a bit turned off by the $43 prices tag for 10 episodes, regardless of the reason. If you only had 10 episodes left to sell from season 3, Funimation, then prorate the pricing accordingly please. I will keep buying, but am not real pleased with the pricing for the product. Did I mention I didn't like the price tag? Pricing keeps it from a 5-Star rating for me."
3,one piece season 3 fifth voyage,one piece season 3 fifth voyage is a funny filler but i dnt consider it filler but thats just me my only complaint is we dont get eposide 206 which finishes off the g-8 arc i wonder why that was not included does any body no but great filler all together just wish could of saw the end in this set
3,Dissapointed,"If a big fan of One Piece, but I was very disappointed when this came out. Normally I'm okay with the filler arcs, but I felt this fell a bit short from their other adventures and was a waste taking up a whole dvd set on it."
2,a filler arc.......,"I am interested in how funimation dubs episodes 196-206 that are rumored to be included with this set. Even if episodes 207 and 208 are not included with this set, I still plan on preordering this dvd, although I am not a particular fan of filler arcs. At least we get a new ending out of it.now:G8 strongholdNext:season 4:Davy back fight and filler memory loss arcs."
1,Quackery with no scientific basis,"This DVD is filled with the mumbo-jumbo goobledygook pseudo-science that may trick the ignorant into believing that this is a way to cure cancer. It isn't. Not one person using the products described in the DVD has ever been cured of cancer. Sadly, desperate people with serious medical problems are often the most gullible."
2,Not a very good map if you want to get around Williamsburg,"Despite the fact that ""Williamsburg"" is in the name of this map, the Williamsburg portion of the map is relegated to a small box in the corner of one side. Instead, it's primarily a map of Newport News and surrounding areas. And the part that is of Williamsburg isn't even comprehensive - it cuts off the outlet-mall/Pottery area and the I-64/199 intersection, and there's no close-up of the Colonial Williamsburg attractions. Unless you need street-level detail for the residential areas of W'burg, you're better off with the free map they hand out in the historic area - it's not to scale, but everything is clearly marked and it covers the entire W'burg/James City County area."
5,EXCELLENT,"I'VE BEEN A BIG FAN OF TOWER OF POWER FOR 40+ YEARS. AND I'M A MUSICIAN FOR A LOT LONGER. TODAY, THESE SO CALLED ROCK GROUPS CAN'T EVEN BLOW THERE NOSES! LIKE THE FAMED COMEDIAN JIMMY DURANTE SAID WHEN ROCK FIRST CAME OUT IN THE EARLY 50'S, DOSE GUYS ONLY KNOW 3 CHORDS, AND TWO OF DEM ARE WRONG!!!!!! SO AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, TOWER OF POWER LEAVES THESE GUYS IN THE DUST..FRANK COLLETT"
4,"""Still good as I remember!""","The CD was in great condition, and the music brings back old memories,Tower of Power at their best!"
5,gus gus!!!!!!,"i bought darny as a christmas gift for my b-F!!!! we love it like crazY! its our pet! we changed his name to ""gus-gus"" because his orginal name has the word ""darn"" in it. he gets mad when we say darny! hes so adorablez and easy to take care of. and he is very well behaved and works well with children. :)"
4,"I must say, brilliant!","Diana, Georgia's sweetheart, has brought forth a single that is stunning. Although she was not my first choice of that slot beside Fantasia, her music on this single can make your heart sing along with her. I was disappointed with her full album, because I had such high hopes with this album out. But, I still listen to this single almost every day.1. Dreams- 8/10 A good song to start with. It does not overwhelm you, yet it doesn't leave a peice missing.2. Don't Cry Out Loud- 10/10 I love this song. Powerful vocals and powerful lyrics create an outstanding song. A favorite song from the third American Idol season.3. I Believe- 7/10 Not a great song choice, but Diana copes with it well.Total: 9/10If her album wasn't for you, but you like her voice, I suggest this single. A pop powerhouse is a great addition to a music collection, and Diana has 3 great songs waiting to be added."
3,GOOD EFFORT,She is extremely talented but someone has told her it is necessary to SCREAM and it is not. She is good without over doing it.
1,No Offense,"Diana is talented, and there is no denying that - but come on! This single sucks, to be perfectly blunt. DREAMS is a drab, mediocre song that has a lot of ""schlock"" factor. DON'T CRY OUT LOUD is ridiculous, and her version of I BELIEVE really is a pale comparison to that of Fantasia. Also, Diana definitley needs to stop the screaming - there is a lot to be said for a subtle singer. Diana deserves better material, and needs more time to perfect her craft. Until then, don't buy this trash."
2,OK......,I think it was respectable start but I wasn't blown away. I don't think this is her vain of music. She probably would have done better if she did a Patsy Cline song since she is her favorite singer.Just my opinion
2,Room for improvement,"Diana will have a successful career ahead of her, she just needs to practice a little more and get more voice training. After hearing her on AI3, I expected better and will look forward to her better albums in the future."
2,She's not ready yet,"Sorry, I Believe they picked the wrong songs for her to sing. They should think of Madonna's and Whitney's first releases which were fun, upbeat and youthful and will represent her age and maturity better.She has a powerhouse voice and as she matures she will learn to sing with more softness and less yelling when she hits her high notes.I look forward to her album as I am sure they will narrow her song selections to better reflect her unique and powerful voice.I wish Diana alot of determination to get them to help her do it right so she doesnt become another Justin."
3,"Not great,not horrible","Diana does alright on this. It's certainly one of the three weakest AI cds so far but it is worlds better than the winner ""Tasia""'s cd. Diana relies on her voice(rather than ""yeahs"" trills and squeks) to pull off the cheesy tune ""Believe"" and she does a pretty good job all in all. I think she did a great job on ""Dont cry"" but it's just a better song all around anyways. With a little time and some training Diana should easily be able to achieve her dreams of stardom"
2,A Very Disappointed Diana Fan!!!,"I was a staunch supporter of Diana throughout AI. Voted for her faithfully each week! I was waiting for this single...had it in my player before my car even left the parking lot. I was expecting much more from this single, and I reluctantly admit I'm very disappointed. It wasn't near my expectations, based on her performances on the show. There just wasn't the connection anymore, and I found the songs a bit flat. Wondering if she rushed to get a single out when more time should have been taken producing and arranging these songs. She should know them well enough by now to sing them better. :( Hopefully she'll work harder on a full CD, and it will be worth purchasing!"
4,WOW,"After getting this cd home all I can say is it is really really good. I give it 4 stars! I didn't care for ""I Believe"" but ""Dreams"" and ""Don't Cry Out Loud"" made the CD worth it!"
1,"In the words of Simon, ""So what?""","She has a pretty voice, is a spunky girl, and souds older than 17. What's missing? Originality. I've heard this before. She's no Kelly Clarkson who has a wonderful quality to her voice and has a voice that fits with everything from Rock to R&B. Unfortunately Diana isn't given great material to work with here either. Her version of I believe is nothing in comparison to Barrino's and Dreams is just corny. I think this CD shows why FANTASTIC FANTASIA won."
1,diana deGARBAGE!!!,Give me a break! I think she got some nerve singing Fantasia's song!! It's conniving! She's just a sore loser and is still competing with Fantasia or trying to!! This girl is BORING to listen to. She may have a beautiful voice(this I agree) but she does not have the passion that should accompany this kind of music! She's just loud! Thank goodness I didn't buy it. I heard it playing in Walmart today and I walked right over to Fantasia's section! I'd rather listen to someone who sings from her heart than someone who is contrived like she is!
1,Not a Good CD,"Diana is good, but has work to do. She can carry a high tune, but can't get too low. I think in a couple of years she will have more ability to sing a wider range. I saw her on Ryan Seacrest and The View and it sounded like she was screaming. I don't think her single is a good buy. The songs are OK, but not worth having."
1,DeGarmo shows why she didn't win,"DeGarmo's bland, often shouting, singing voice is enough to put the average listener to sleep when she sings of nothing but sappy love songs on this 3-track single. Don't waste your time."
1,Singing through her nose?,I have listened to her through-out her stint on American Idol and could never figure out how she made it to the final 2? I again tried to listen to the 3 songs offered here and just can't take her voice. She sounds like she has a very bad cold. Does anyone else hear this too?
1,Just not good enough,"I bought Diana's and Fantasia's single. I do like Diana's better, but that is not saying much. I give it 1 star, because it is not worth much. Sorry, was hoping to really like it, but didn't at all!"
4,GIVE THE LADY HER STARS !!!!!!!!!!!!,"FIRST OFF, COME ON PEOPLE ONE STAR [PLEASE} BE HONEST NOW IF YOU TOOK THE TIME TO GO OUT ON THE FIRST DAY AND BUY THE CD THEN YOU MUST OF IN SOME WAY LIKED THE WAY DIANA SUNG AND IF YOU TOOK THE SECOND STEP AND ACTUALLY LISTENED TO IT, THEN YOU WOULD OF NEVER RATED THE WAY YOU DID BECAUSE SHE WAS AMAZING ON ALL THREE SONGS EITHER YOUR TONE DEAF OR YOU WERE JUST TRYING TO DISCREDIT DIANA! AND THATS NOT RIGHT GIVE THE YOUNG LADY HER PROPS IF YOU LIKE ANOTHER IDOL THEN SUPPORT THEM BUT YOU DONT HAVE TO DISCREDIT DIANA IN THE PROCESS AND BY THE WAY THE ONLY REASON I DIDNT RATE HER A 5 STAR IS BECAUSE NOBODY IS PERFECT BUT SHES AS CLOSE AS YOU CAN GET KEEP GOING DIANA AND ILL AWAIT YOUR ALBUNN GOD BLESS WOW ONE STAR STILL CANT GET OVER THAT!!!!!! PEOPLE ITS WORTH THE MONEY SEE FOR YOURSELF!"
5,GREAT JOB,This cd is a must have... Diana for a 17 year old girl did a wonderful job on this single... her voice is awesome so therefore it is captivated and showcased very well in the songs she sings on this cd
5,Dianamite!!!!,I can't stop playing this wonderful cd. Diana DeGarmo is a national singing treasure and this cd totally delivers. Each song is so powerful and inspirational. A must buy for all ages!
3,It's ok but I expected more,Let me start buy saying I think Diana is incredibly talented. She can hold a note for days but I don't think this cd does anything to showcase her strengths. It was pleasant but I expected sooooooo much more from her! I thought Don't Cry Out Loud was boring and emotionless and that suprised me because I loved her performance on AI. I sure do hope her full cd is better.
5,I LOVED it!,I would reccomend this single to all fans of American Idol as well as anyone else who enjoys amzing music with a fresh sound.
4,A worthy single,"Diana DeGarmo shows why she made it to the finale of American Idol on this single. Dreams is a fantastic ballad which showcases the power and strength that Diana has, regardless of her young age. The Tamyra Gray written single, I Believe, also blows me away with the improvement that Diana has shown over the course of the show. While Don't Cry Out Loud also shines, it doesn't quite stand up to the vocal power she showed when she first sang it on the show. She definitely could have belted out a few more of the notes. Overall, with some professional training that she will receive from her newfound celebrity, her future albums are bound to become great successes that she most certainly deserves."
5,Dianamite!!!,Diana DeGarmo is a national singing treasure! This cd will inspire and amaze anyone at any age.
5,WONDERFUL!,"Diana Degarmo is an extremely talented singer. She sings all three of the songs on this single wonderfully. I have heard Fantasia's version of ""I Believe"". There is no comparison. Fantasia's is full of her squeaky, raspy voice and overwhelming ""yeah""s while Dianas is sung beautifully. I recommend that you buy this single."
4,Good job!,"It's so nice to hear songs and and be able to make out the words. She is improving all the time. I've been a Diana fan since Broken Wing on AI. I like how she takes any negatives and sees them in a positive light. The only thing about my Cd is that I wish it had a video in it, but it didn't. I give it 4 stars."
5,What a True Talent!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I think she is such a bright light and i LOVED the cd from the first note to the last. Everyone is being hard on Dont Cry outloud but only cuz it is diff than they are used to but its okay to be diff and i love the way it changed. I think Diana has true talent and she will go far and be around for a long long long time and i dont care what anyone says, all the rude comments people make show how heartless people really are. This is a girl who is very talented and i say if its not your style of music than dont but it but you dont have to trash what she does becuz you dont like it. Personally i LOVED the cd and i cant wait for the album so i will tell anyone who loves Diana to def. buy the cd!!!! To all those who want to bash her.....GROW UP!!!"
3,Good Start,"Alright Diana!The girl is talented and this CD proves that she has potential, however, Im not too sure about how long she will last. There is still that pagent/talent show quality there that dulls this single.I also believe that the choice of songs were not good either. Diana has alot of energy and she likes to move. Her music should reflect that. Right now, it sounds like a boot-leg Celine Dion or LeAnn.DIANA...U CAN SING, be yourself, step up/out and be different, BE YOU!3 STARS!!!"
2,"Review for ""Dreams"" by Diana DeGarmo","I rooted for Fantasia from beginning to end of American Idol, but I must admit Diana made a few good performances. However, most of them, such as ""Don't Cry Out Loud"" sound like she is simply screaming the lyrics as loud as she can to make it appear that she has a powerful voice; she sounds like Roseanne Barr singing the ""Star Spangled Banner"" at times. Her CD is no better than her live performances. Her voice is very nasal and annoying and she doesn't really deserve to have a CD. Her version of ""I Believe"" doesn't hold a candle to Fantasia's version. And the other 2 songs don't make up for it. I am not a hard-core Fantasia fan, and I'm not a hard-core Diana fan either. I am just giving my honest opinion so people will realize before they purchase this CD that it isn't very good. I give it 2 stars for sheer effort."
2,"Don't ""Cry"" Out Loud! Don't!","Not that I don't like Diana DeGarmo...well, maybe. There's something about the quality of her voice that I can't stand.Not that Diana DeGarmo is too young...well, a little bit. I think she's trying too hard.Not that Diana DeGarmo can't sing...well, just OK. I don't these are the best song choice for her.Dream - I didn't she capture the feelings and it was a bit pitchy.Don't Cry Out Loud - It was kind of flat.I Believe - She just didn't catch the soul of the song.Overall, she sang these three very different song with the same technic - and it was not very a good one."
1,Missed the mark,Diana's CD was mediocre and was simply void of anything that could set her apart. Diana Degarmo has potential but currently lacks both the life and musical experience to make it in the industry today.
1,diana!!!,this is an extremely lucky girl: how she made it to the final two I have no idea. she is so boring to listen to! she sounds so fake singing....i can't feel her at all!
3,Hope this is not her best,"I liked Diana on American Idol. I think Fantasia deserved to win though. I bought both of their singles and prefer Fantasias.Diana, well hers was boring, but her performances on the show were not. I hope her new cd will be a lot better.As for my AI opinions I think it should have been between LaToya and Fantasia with Diana being third."
3,"blah, blah, blah","I think Diana has a very good voice and with time she will come into her own. I do however think that she needs to work on being herself. When she was on stage she seemed to artificial and needs to relax. I think that along with Fantasia's great, mature voice, her down to earth personality won people over.I can't see where bashing either girl does any good. Let's face it, none of us are probably half as good as either one of them!Good Luck to both!"
1,Screaming her face off,"All she does is scream her face off in this cdDo not waste your money on this dreadful first outingIt sounds like she is dragging you thru a funeral marchWho wants to listen to such dreary, drab, dull musicMusic should be entertaining not painstaking"
5,Diana = amazing!,"although there are only 3 songs, i cant stop listening to any of them. Diana is an amazing singer and this single is living proof."
5,Diana is far superior to Fantasia,"I bought this CD yesterday Boy can this chick sing.She does all songs very well and she gives me goosebumps hearing her beautiful voice.I highly recommend this to everybody except Fantasia fans they enjoy screaming and Yeah,Yeah,Yeahs you won't find any of that here sorry"
5,The best.....,This is by far the best idol single to come yet. She is an amazing singer and will go far!
1,Diana Degarmo--A WoRK iN PrOGrEsS,"If you want to buy a CD that is ""feel good"" music, I wouldn't recommend Diana's Single. It's somewhat unenthusiastic. It doesn't excite me or make me feel or think about anything. It's just O.....K... I am both a Fantasia and a Diana fan, but something about Fantasia's singing from the depths of her soul is just amazing and Diana is good too but---A Work In Progress. I would give her about five or six years to mature vocally and performance wise but even still, what Fantasia has, she was born with and Diana doesn't do it for me........maybe one day though, I'll be optimistic."
2,"She's Good, But Not The Best","I'm not going to be unkind regarding Diana DeGarmo, as some customers felt it was necessary to be to Fantasia, choosing to make an issue of her personal struggle and be judgemental. Diana DeGarmo is a talented girl with a great personality and graciousness that transcends her age. This is only a respectable single, however, and I would be interested in seeing how she handles different material."
5,5 star review for a 5 star singing sensation!!!,"All 3 songs on the CD are HITS! I play them over and over and can't get enough of Diana's fantastic voice. I wish she had won, but being 2nd is about as good as 1st. And sometimes better. Go Diana!"
1,Nothing to say about it.,"I listened to the cd and was not impressed at all. It was like simon said a so what performance. I think with a little bit more practice Diana could be a really good singer. I would not say I wasted my money, but I know what to expect next time."
5,Fantasia a winner but not respected by public,"How sad. Here we have a supposed winner, but she gets no respect for either her background (unwed teenage sexaholic) or her non-talent. So what can she offer the public? Only novelty (and the fact that she;s a freak show). She's going to be a one-hit wonder. And it won't be a wonder since she was never a legiitmate AI winner to begin with."
2,Not the Best,"I was a little disappointed to be honest. I loved Diana on American Idol, but there's something missing here. Don't Cry Out Loud isn't good. Dreams is okay, and I like I Believe the best. I also didn't like Clay's or Kelly's singles at first, and look at them now.This is her first single and it shows there is much room for her to grow as an artist. However, even though this probably isn't her at her best, look at how she is selling here at Amazon. Fantasia's at 5 and she's at 9.Bottom line-I'm not giving up on her yet. I think she's got much more to show us in the future."
2,It is alright but...,"I think the only song I enjoyed on it is ""Don't cry out lod"". The others I did not like at all. She pales in comparison to Fantasia Barrino, on the previous songs, and does not have me singing along with her which is abad thing to me, because when I really enjoy an artist and thier music I always sing along. This one by DD is not making me feel that way ..so I wouldn't buy it again. Waste of money"
5,and the REAL WINNER IS.............,"DIANA!!! As with Clay, once again, the real winner was announced on TV. Only the real fans know who the true winner is ~ and that's Diana!! I have no intention of buying anything from ""what's her name?"", but anything that Diana puts out ~ I'll be first in line! Can't wait for the concert!! It was the same with Clay ~ Ruben who? We'll show 'em who's #1!! Love to Diana and all her fans!! Keep reaching for the stars!!"
2,I just didn't like it,I wished that they would have let her sing DCOL like she did on AI. And Dreams is a sappy song with sappy lyrics. I hope that her album is better than this. Diana is such a sweet girl and just needs better songs to work with.
2,Honestly,Diana needs to take her music in a differnt direction.She is great.....but the single isn't. Point blank. Im not a hater. I just don't like the single.I would have given 1 star for this incredibly boring and dry single but because I actually like HER.....2 stars!
1,Yawn....,"Don't waste your money on this piece of garbage. Yeah, so she can hit some high notes, but where's the emotion, the passion, the SOUL??? Not on this watered down sugary sweet boring disc."
1,do not recommend,"she really has no emotion in any of the songs i gave her 1 star because there isnt a no star option ,obviously im not the only one that feels this way because she is number 30 and this her debut week? something is definetly wrong .i suggest you save your money because this isnot worth it maybe her full album will be better.........."
1,THIS CD IS TRASH!!!!,"That's exactly where it went IN THE TRASH!!!I took my portable cd player in the store and opened one of these cds up and listened to it in the store because I wanted to listen to it first.Well, I listened to it then took about 10 cds that were on the shelf looked for the garbage and threw them away TRASH!!!Even all the people that I was with hated the crap!"
5,Diana's CD Single,I absolutely loved this CD. Diana definitely has a future and I will definitely be buying her next cd.
5,Miss Diana,"After hearing these three tracks, I can see why Diana made it so far in the AI3 competion. And even though she should have won, she still delivers some knock-out performances. My favorite has to be ""I Believe"" because she really showcases her vocal abilities in this powerful number. Go Diana and can't wait for your debut album."
5,Very good job,"It's my new favorite CD. I play this in my car all the time now! Diana DeGarmo is flawless! Some won't like her, but that is their choice and they are missing out. She should have won American Idol, but those biased judges messed it up. At least she made it to runner up and is doing good now."
2,We Still Love Her,"The Diana singing on this CD is not the same Diana who performed on television, is it? What happened??? ""Dreams"" was, as judge Randy Jackson would say, aiight. But, ""Don't Cry Out Loud"" -- what happened??? This is not the way she sang it on the show -- the one that blew everybody away -- the best performance of that night's competition! Again, what happened??? ""I Believe"" is the best song on the CD, although I missed the ""Love Keeps Lifting Me Higher"" part. I am disappointed in this young lady's first effort, based on her vocal performances on the show. We know she can do better. Hopefully she'll get a chance. As Paula would say, ""Oh well, we still love you."""
3,HMMM..,"This album is a decent debut. I was dissappointed with it after seeing her on the show. She has a great voice, but very little personality through her music."
3,Because she gave it her best shot,Diana did not rise to the level of performer that I would buy a record by her. She gave it her best shot and it just wasn't good enough. If things don't change in the quality of her voice she probably won't be around long. I feel for her because people can be so mean and some of the comments are totally uncalled for. She is cute enough for something on broadway though; good job Diana for hanging tough.
3,Diana? One Star? Yeah Right!,Diana is amazing!! all of these one star reviews...they are wrong!! Her single sounds amazing on every track and gives my the chills everytime!! Go Diana!!
5,The real American idol winner Season three,"how she didn't win I don't know maybe the judges felt she was to good for the competition and fantasia needed the ""American Idol""Title to sell cds.Diana don't need that her voice will do the talking and she's gonna be a big star"
5,Proves that she should have won,This is one of the best cds I have bought in a while. Dreams left me speechless. It is FANTASTIC. Her version of I Believe was much better than Fantasia
4,Great voice,"Diana is a great young singer, she has tremendous potential to be a big pop start, will like to see more from her in the future. Also, she should do a concert with Clay."
5,WOW WAY TO GO DIANA YOU ARE A AMERICAN IDOL,All three are wonderful songs and what a great way to start Diana's Great Career. 5 POWERFUL STARS ALL THE WAY!
1,deGARBAGE!!!,"I gave this cd a chance and I was disappointed too. I mean, come on people....let us be for real: she is flat throughout!! I'm sorry Diana but I have to be honest here...you are not connected to the music you sing. It is rather ashame because you do have a beautiful voice but a very dull delivery. It is no WONDER to me that Fantasia will be singing in NYC for 4th of July celebration...she is fantastic...I think Diana needs about 5 more years to get connected and to learn how to deliver. Her time will come but right now ain't it!!"
1,Waste of Money,"I am so disappointed with this cd. I really liked Diana on AI, but without the excitement of the show to back her she sounds awful. She will probably be better in a few years, but for now I won't be buying anything else she releases."
2,A Fair Review,"I've listened to samples of both singles and I have made my conclusion. Both versions of ""I Believe"" are cheesy, but at least Fantasia sings it with emotion, Diana DeGarmo sings it too low, which is not what she's known for. ""Dreams"" sounds just like ""I Believe"" but worse, still the problem of her singing too low. ""Don't Cry Out Loud"" is the best song on the CD Single. The reason why is because she at least sings higher and louder on the chorus, but still, during the verses she sings low.Conclusion: If you liked Diana DeGarmo's lower voice on American Idol this is the CD for you. If you liked when she let go and sang louder and higher, this is definatley not the CD for you."
3,success,"I hope she has much success. Unlike the sickos who were so busy saying such mean things about Fantasia, I wish her well. Tell all the sickos who were cowards and tried to hurt the succes of Fantasia that they really helped her because the persons angered by the senseless attacks actually brought her cd. It also hurt Diana because of the anger for the cowardly lies about such a talented person as Fantasia. I love her voice."
5,American Idol Did It Again..........The Wrong Person Won,Diana was awsome. She deserved to win. It was so good. She has a big career in front in her.
1,Diana...,"Hey, I listened to both Fantasia vs Diana's rendition of I Believe: I must say that Fantasia renders a powerful version of the song....while Diana may be able to hit the high notes I'm afraid that is not enough....Fantasia makes you believe that you can do whatever it is you want to....Diana to me was not connected to the song she just sang and for me anyway, I need to feel any music that I am going to shell out money for...Diana is not enjoyable to listen to...she needs more work and the sales ratings prove it!"
1,Extremely Bland,"A very pleasant voice, with not much distinction. Might do better with different material to work with."
4,Really Good! Pleasently Surprised!,"I bought Fantasia's single first, because after all, she was the winner. I wasn't too impressed with her. But then I picked up Diana's and was completly taken aback! I always thought she was very good on the show, but she sounds even better in the studio! I was very impressed, especially with ""Don't Cry Out Loud"". It's great!"
5,Great talent,Go Diana! Great to see she won the second place spot fair and square. Unlike the winner Fantasia who cheated her way through the competition. Doesn't already having a record deal make her unfit for the show? TSK TSK...Diana wins!!!!
2,It was respectable....,"I was kind of disappointed. I enjoyed her live performances, but I thought this single was boring. I found myself fast forwarding and skipping around.Diana needs new producers and she needs better material to work with. I think she would have done better with an up tempo song on the single instead of 3 over-the-top-you-can-do-it-if-u-put-your-mind-in-to-it-I-can-sing-a-rainbow-while-walking-through-the-daisies Songs!STAND UP FOR YOURSELF DIANA"
2,Exceptional,"There's only one song that I can really get a feel for and that's Dreams. I didn't like the I believe song or the way it was presented it lacked originality. For a mediocre song such as this one to be accepted, an artist must bring forth something new to take the place of the bland lyrics and this was not done. The intention of the song was to be of the Pop genre, however there was alot of shouting. And then there's the Don't Cry Out Loud, the lower registry was not working the favor of Diana. But her high registry was working overtime. Congratulations to such a sweet girl, for this is her first cd release."
2,NEED TIME TO GROW MORE!,"DIANA DEGARMO HAS AN OKAY VOICE FOR HER AGE,IN TIME SHE WILL IMPROVE. THE SONG (DON'T CRY OUT LOUD) WAS NOT GOOD QUALITY AND HER PITCH WAS OFF SOME.I ENJOYED HER ON AI3 BUT I DID NOT THINK SHE WAS ONE OF THE TOP 3. I HOPE SHE HAS A LONG STANDING IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY. THE PEOPLE WHO BASH OTHER ARTIST DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT IF YOU DON'T LIKE SOMEONE YOU DON'T HAVE TO LISTEN TO THEIR CD."
1,"This CD Single Sucks, Big Time!",Diana sounds like a sour fool. She is and never will be an American Idol because she has no talent. Singing is not standing on a stage and yelling until you are out of breath. Take this mess and shove it Diana.
1,Fantasia's version of I Believe is infinitely better,Fantasia's version of this song runs rings around DeGarmo's bland take on it. And 'Don't Cry Out Loud'? This choice of song bores me to tears.
1,"No offense, but Diana still has a very long way to go","She is no Christina Aguilera. Her only decent song is ""Don't Cry Out Loud,"" yet the performance of that song is not consistent. Sometimes she's good, other times she's horrendous. No originality, no creativity. Maybe she'll improve as she gets older."
5,No where to go but...,No where to go but up! This is the best I've EVER heard from a 16 year old singer! I can only imagine what she will be like when she's 18 or 20. This CD is a must have for anyone serious about American Idol.
4,Pretty Decent,"First off, Diana didn't stand much of a chance winning American Idol due to the extreme and obvious favortism by the judges which is a shame. Although she made her share of mistakes, she's only 16 which means she has plenty of time to grow.This single is pretty good. ""Dreams"" and ""I Believe"" are ok *I definitely prefer Diana's version of ""I Believe"" over Fantasia's.* The real winner is ""Don't Cry Out Loud"" which was originally a #10 pop hit for Melissa Manchester back in 1979. Diana perfomed it a few times on the show. It's a beautiful power ballad and worth buying the single for."
1,Gave it a chance,I gave this cd a chance and I was disappointed because I felt her cd was flat.I found that her performance on the show were better than her cd. The Dream song was too cheesy and She screamed through her songs. She was off key. They should have not rushed her cd out but let it show her full talent as a singer. This might really hurt her so will the people who are giving this cd 4 or 5 stars when it clear that this cd is a rush job
1,No subtlety or artistry,"Although she hits the notes, I can't say that Diana DeGarmo infuses any subtleties in her CD. Her idea of nuance is varying degrees of loud: loud, very loud, extremely loud. She doesn't have any mature level of musicianship or artistry... just a halfway decent voice."
1,DIANA MAYBE IN 5 YEARS,Diana may become a good singer in 5 year or so. Her cd is not getting attention because she lack the emotion in her songs. This site is really a joke because some people like on artist more they feel the need to downgrade another. I don't care for Diana cd but there is no reason to use personal attacks on her.Maybe most people on this site just need to make personal attacks to feel better about who they are.
5,(...),"This CD is the Bomb!!!!!!!!!!Diana you rock you are gonna be huge someday.This is real talent people she is simply amazing she's giving me goosebumps expecially during her performance of ""My Heart Will Go On"" i swear she sounded like Celine Dion when she sung that.Buy this CD you won't be Disappointed unless you are a jealous fantasia fan."
3,PEOPLE ARE CRAZY!,The reason I came on here to prove a point. It seems like everybody is trying to give these young ladies bad reviews. I go on to look at Fantasia and it seems the same people from the same states are giving diana and fantasia the same 1 stars if you dont like either one of them dont tear these ladies down just because you have nothing to do. Everyone has their own taste in music and its obvious that fantasia is r&b while diana is something else everybody have their own opinions but dont go tearing these young ladies down its not fair. Lets see what you can do in front of alot of people.
5,Excellent,"For 25 I'd say she sings excellent, but she's only 17! What more can I say? It's a must have CD because of the emotion she imparts to it."
2,Wasted Talent,"WHY did Diana allow them to do this to her!?! I enjoyed her performances on AI....I enjoy seeing her interviews. She such a happy person. I am happy for her. I simply do not like this single. Sure she can sing them but it doesn't seem to fit her 16 y/o, ""cheery""-happy happy-joy joy personality. I hope her future album is NOT full of cheesy elevator music. I am disappointed.SPEAK UP DIANA...BE YOU!!"
1,Diana DeBARF0 - Another no talent blonde,"She didn't impress me on American Idol, and I wish I understood HOW she got to the final two. Oh I know, the teenybopper vote. This season of American Idol was horrible, and if it wasn't for Jennifer, La Toya, and Fantasia, I wouldn't have watched. Luckily there was a miracle and Fantasia won. I got scared for a while, other no talents from AI3 like John Stevens outlasted some great talent....and all because of the teenybopper vote.Diana can't sing, she yells, and fills her songs with ""C'mon Y'all"" filler. How many times can someone sing that? Easy lyrics to remember, which is a plus for teenyboppers. She sings off-key, she sang off-key several times during the AI3 competition.Don't waste your money on this album. You might as well stock up on Britney album and singles, at least Britney is a better preformer.Take a stand against teenybopper pop and ignore this single, ignore her album. It's time for teenybopper pop to disappear!!!!"
2,Huh?,"I found this single to be boring and plain. Not as good as it could have been. She struck out, which is too bad. Her vocals on the show actually sounded better."
4,Classic Sneaker,I love this style; have worn them for years. Cut a little smaller but ok--depends on which country makes them.
5,Reebok Women's Classic,"Merchandise came in quick. Product is exctly as described and well put together. No "" glue"" spots that show or anything of sort like you'd see coming from a ""cheaper made"" company! Would definitely recommend to other!"
5,gift,This item was a christmas gift for my grandmother and she says they are wonderful and that she recommends everyone should own a pair!
3,Shoes are for narrow feet!,I have taken the same size for many years now but find their shoes run narrow. Consider ordering one half to one size larger than you normally wear. Nice shoe otherwise.Marcus Uniforms is outstanding! I ordered on the 9th and had by the 12th (standard shipping).
4,Reebok good fit,I normally wouldn't buy shoes over the internet because I prefer to try them on. I bought these Reeboks because I have bought the same kind and size in the past and knew the size and model. They fit well and I had no problems with them.
4,nice shoes,"the shoes looks nice on my feet and feels comfy..like them so far..last or not, can't tell now...overall, the experience is not bad..."
1,"Reebok Classic ""Leather""","I bought, looked, called Reebok, and returned item because I wanted leather shoes.I wrote a review and was rejected because Reebok's phone number was it. Amazon, I wish you had returned my original so that I could amend it.The gist is that there shoes are NOT leather. See Reebok's response to my query.Thank you for contacting Reebok.com customer service.The Reebok Classic Leather shoes are made of the synthetic soft leather.

4,Quick. Thought provoking. Motivational. Loses steam toward the end,"PROS: The premise of this book makes it great for motivational moments, and you can read it cover-to-cover in less than 20 minutes. I've used the intro in two organizational presentations and both times, it has spawned lots of discussion. The 212 concept is developed enough that it can be easily merged into a variety of industry areas and adapted for different audiences--professional, personal, religious, etc. CONS: I bought it after I scanned the first few pages, and was a little disappointed to find that the content gets a little watered down as the book progresses. It starts to become a collection of motivational sayings without any additional substance. One of the ""chapters/sections"" is only 2 pages long, and I kept thinking, ""did they leave pages out?"" OVERALL: The beginning of the book is powerful, and the concepts will stick, so it's well worth it's tiny pricetag!212 The Extra Degree"
2,disappointed,You're better off paying a few extra dollars and getting the hardcover version with pictures.
3,Let's face it,"Let's face it, it takes 300 times as much heat energy to change liquid water at 212 degrees to steam at 212 degrees, as it does to raise liquid water from 211 to 212 degrees. Have you got 300 times the energy as the analogy suggests? Think about that. Makes me tired thinking about it!"
4,Quick Read with a Great Message,"I read quite a few ""sales, sales management, and motivational books.This is one of my favorites. Quick read with a solid point. Be sure to check out the website for the video, pretty cool.Cheap enough to pass along to your teams and will leave them thinking :-)"
3,2nd Step,"This is a great cheerleading book, after you read or hear a leadership seminar. It tries to encouarge you to do, what you have just learned, by suppling a bunch of quotes from motivating people. Overall, good book, short book, but don't expect it to give you a great leadership idea, outside of the 212 degree theory."
1,Save your money,"SL Parker writes on page four of this charming little pamphlet ""So simple is the analogy, that you can stop reading right now, walk away with the opening thought firmly planted in your mind and benefit from it for the rest of your life."" I'm not sure about the life-long benefits, but I agree that, had I stopped right then & there, I wouldn't have missed a thing.Big fonts, bigger margins, poor writing & not even a particulary interesting premise. Most of the passion of the book falls in the last few pages where you are enticed to buy copies of the book by the 100's and give them to everyone you know. Let me save you $10. What Mr. Parker wants you to know is this: If you want something, work for it. Hard. That's it. And it's free."
5,Fantastic!,"I got this book to help motivate me to get back in shape, and it has really helped! It's such a quick read that I plan to read it at least a few times a month to keep my mind ""in shape"" as well! I highly recommend this book!"
3,great seller and good book,"The shipping was fast, the product was perfect and in excellant shape...I highly recommend this seller...It was a pleasure doing business with you and definately will do so again....this wasn't the book that I was looking for but it was in excellant condition"
4,Pleased with the product,"This mattress came wonderfully packaged as promised, and fit perfectly on the frame I'd purchased,American Furniture Alliance Evolution Futon Frame Full, Pewter. It's comfortable!"
1,way too firm,"I was hoping this futon mattress would be an acceptable substitute for a real mattress, but it isn't, at least for me. It is way too firm for my liking. I can hardly move when I get up in the morning after I sleep on it. (I have a somewhat bad back). It claims to be 8 inches thick, but it is barely 6 inches. I put a memory foam mattress cover on this futon mattress which helps some but is very hot to sleep on. I would have tried to return this mattress but the seller I bought it from had an extremely short return period."
3,Not the Whole Truth,"I had hoped this was the whole text by Hitch but it is the same as the other one that does not use the word ""Nuclear."""
3,Interesting but (Very) Dated,"I really like the concept of looking critically at the economics of nuclear defense, but this work could stand to be updated. All of the data(GNP, force sizes, defense budgets, etc.) is from the 1950's and early 60's and more than a little stale. Having said that, the analysis is first rate and the economic calculations appear to have been fairly accurate models of future behavior."
4,A very cool Eurobeat compilation!,"Unlike the US where hip-hop and rock n' roll has been synonymous with the racing scene, in Japan things are a bit different.Since the popularity of the anime series ""Initial D"", in Japan, Eurobeat and club music has been the music featured on music compilations dedicated to racing and automobile campaigns.With the avex trax label promoting its avex car sound campaign, a two CD compilation from avex features music such as Justin Timberlake's ""SEXY BACK"", Beyonce's ""DEJA VU"", Jessica Simpson's ""A PUBLIC AFFAIR"", Gnarls Barkley's CRAZY"" to past hits like Rockwell's ""Somebody Watching Me"", Madonna's ""La Isla Bonita""and many other hits being remade (and sung by other performers) and remixed.The first disc deals with songs featured on previous Eurobeat compilations from Avex but this second CD are covers of popular music.Fortunately, the singers are good and music is done well.Definitely an album to add to your collection."
1,Yikes!,"I've been a Battlestar Galactica fan from the beginning, and I have to say I have read a lot of fan fiction (including a lot of bad fan fiction!) that's actually better and more consistent to the series than this. Richard has given us - I presume unintentionally - a kind of white male Aryan power fantasy. This book is really a mess. Go to the used bookstores and look up the older novels; even the worst ones were better. Or check out some good fan fiction."
3,"Less psi, more Galactica","I looked forward to Armageddon being a book about the charachters I have watched and read about over the years, instead I read a book about psychic powers of an elite few, minimal character development and little about what had happened in the interveining 18 yahren. I was hoping for more character development and action.I got a large amount of pseudo religion that I don't feel the fan is looking for. The things I was looking for were there, just in too small a quantity. I hope that the new book will be better."
1,What an ego trip for Richard Hatch,"What an awful, awful book. Richard Hatch has twisted the Galactica concept and turned his character Apollo (who he obviously sees himself as) into some sort of demi-god. The story rambles and it seems that there was some sort of secret contest the he and his co-writer had to see just how many inconsistancies and contradictions with the original television series that they could cram into each chapter."
3,The journey continues...,"Not bad. Richard is a bit hung up on himself, you can tell by his character, but the Cylons are cool ... wish somebody would write a better battle sequence for the Cylons though."
4,a good read,"I'd never watched Battlestar Galactica, but I decided ""what the hell!"" and gave this a shot. I liked Armageddon a great deal. There's even a glossary in the back of the book which was very helpful to a newbie like me. Armageddon is a damn enjoyable yarn, but Im looking forward to reading Armageddon again after I've seen a few episodes of the show."
4,An exciting continuation of a long-missed story.,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading about characters that I have missed now for many years. Richard Hatch has been able to flesh out many characters that were never really touched on in the original series. The pace was slow, at first, but this was understandable. There was a lot of background information to catch up on. I am eagerly looking foward to his next book!"
2,Weak.,"I am a big fan of Battlestar Galactica, and was expecting more from this book than I got. It borrows heavily from Star Wars, Star Trek, and even Wing Commander. Boring character development kept putting me to sleep."
1,What's with the 4- and 5-star reviews? This book is crap!,"After reading all the reviews of this God-awful book, I am firmly convinced that all one has to do is pound out random gibberish while sitting blindfolded at the keyboard and simply title it Battlestar Galactica to have rabid Galactica fans ooh and aah and rave about how good it is. Actually, if Hatch and Golden had done that instead of pound out this dreck, I might have given that kind of project one star."
3,"It was nice to see the Galactica ""flying"" again, but...","...I was disappointed with the quality of the writing (the actual writing - not the story). I was not expecting elegant prose, but it would have been nice had the writing and sentence structure been geared at the very least toward someone of the high school age group; there were many bothersome incomplete sentences, while many others provided very little detail that was not absolutely essential to the story.I had been hoping for something on the caliber of the first two Larson/Thurston novels (let's face it - the other 12 books in the original series did not compare to the first two). Alas, I was disappointed.Storywise, however, it was nice to see the women in the Galactica universe having something to do other than play doorbell and ""nurse Nancy."""
4,User experience may vary,"I read the reviews of the people who were disappointed with Toast/Jam as a professional grade audio tool. I have no reason to doubt their veracity. But I got it to create killer (excuse the phrase) jams on my Mac. It installed great, I just fire it up, cross-fade, adjust gain, and burn. It does everything I ask of it and I am very happy with the results. If you, like me, want to lay some tunes on friends (in a completely legal way per the RIAA Nazi scum, of course!), this will probably just what you want and need."
4,Marillion fans: get ready to dance!,"This album is a rarity among the Marillion collection. To begin with it's not an album of new material in the strict sense of the word, that is, material put together by the band. It consists of six Marillion songs from the ""This Strange Engine"" album, remixed by Marc Mitchell and Mark Daghorn as dance tracks (most, not all of them).If you are a hardcore (mostly a Fish-era only) Marillion fan, I asure you that you will have a hard time digesting the sole idea of listening to Marillion dance remixes. But if you come into this album with an open mind, never minding who's music is behind it, you'll end up realizing it's a very good production that fits in nicely with the electronica movement of the mid-to-late nineties.In particular, I enjoyed the version of ""Estonia"" and ""Face 1004."""
1,Totally Random Connections,"I would not recommend this. I probably will not buy a Suunto ever again. I don't like the fact that many people had problems with this (Google ""Suunto connection failure"") and Suunto did not fix it, they just kind of discontinued it. My complaint is that one never knows if it will connect or not. This makes analyzing your training logs darn near impossible. They should sell this as a phone technician training device in order to troubleshoot serial connection problems. (I have 30 years in the computer troubleshooting field). To be honest I think the problem is in the either the watch or it's just buggy software (Training Manager Lite). Don't buy this, return your Suunto watch and shop for something different."
1,Egregiously overpriced,"There is simply no excuse for an eighty dollar USB stick.Less-than-glowing reviews for a tiny single-function receiver? Zero Mac support?This silly little stick stands in the way of me ever owning any Suunto watch.Garmin gives them away free in every Forerunner box. You're all savvy online shoppers, quit getting ripped off."
5,If you value your health (and your lungs),"These respirators are great. i wish I had found them years ago. The soft rubber molds to the face and they are quite comfortable, much more so than the inexpensive paper dust masks / surgical masks. I only use them with the pre-filters, which catches just about all of the dust/particulates and just wipe them inside when finished"
4,A must read,"Any college level degree in any discipline is undeserved unless the student has understood the thesis of this book. It is long, sometimes difficult, and not always on the mark, but it is a must read to understand the nature of scientific knowledge. The gems are disperesed throughout, so one must be patient in discovering them.The philosophy of science has been placed on a firm footing, and all pretenses to the notion that Science can discover Truth have been destroyed."
4,College text,Karl Popper has yet to achieve the status I think he might well deserve. He maintains both bold Conjectures and Refutations abound. This book is a must have for any philosophers library.
1,Enough of Christianizing Amercia,"I enjoy self-help, self-exploring books. However, it is disturbing yet another self help book reads more on being the right type of Christian then being a better you, regardless of your faith!I am a Christian. A person of faith with an open mind. I believe that the diversity amoung people are to be celebrated rather than feared and I won't tell people what God wants them to believe.I do belive that it is rare indeed when one person can tell another what God thinks about any controversial issue.This book would have saved me a lot of ""here we go again"", er, time, if Ms. Myers could have written it with out all the Christian Right B--- S---!"
4,This book will help you with your self esteem,"I really like this book. It helped me like myself more, because of who I am in Christ,and not because of the approval of man and the world."
2,Christian overtones,"I tried this book because I suffer from the symptoms mentioned on the cover. I don't like to review books I haven't finished. In this case, I would like to warn other nonreligious readers that this book has overwhelming Christian overtones.The book is inspiring and has good messages and advice but the author quotes from scripture two or three times a paragraph. If you are non-Christian and/or a non-Bible reader it will be very hard to identify with the author.The book does indicate a Christian approach if you read the back cover and I am not opposed to theology in my reading. I just did not expect it to be so intense and dominating that I could not finish the book."
1,Religous dogma,"I was drawn to this book because I do have issues with being liked and accepted. But I couldnt handle all the biblical references and religous dogma splattered on every page. I am a very spiritual and open minded person, but I dont appreciate authors who take a widespread issue such as addiction and then turn out a book that is preaching their particular religous veiwpoint.I wish I would have scanned through this book before buying, good thing I got it at a discount."
4,Life Changing information,This too is a book that will reveal to us certain behavior patterns that really are obstacles to our personal growth. This book reveals how behaving in such a manner is actually a hinderance that we don't seem to be aware of. Most people would do good at reading this book.
4,Enlightening,This book is a total eye opener and Joyce has such a way with words. I think one of the reasons why I love her so much is that she comes at you like a trusted friend and mentor. This book helped me realize why I do some of the silly things that I do and now I am able to start the process of change.
4,Very Helpful!,"I enjoyed reading this book! It had a lot of helpful information. It was easy to follow and understand. She gives some great spiritual advice on how to overcome trying to please everyone. If you feel like you are a pleaser, this book will really help you. You don't have to agree with everything she writes to learn something from the book. Very helpful!"
4,Approval Addiction CD's by Joyce Meyer,"Good information. I enjoyed it to a point but would prefer a different reader. I found the voice somewhat annoying. It's not Joyce reading from her own book. Having said that, Joyce Meyer herself is amazing and if you haven't had a chance to hear or see her program on TV then you are missing out. I keep hearing good things about her new book Power Thinking or something like that. I will probably get that next. So overall, I would say that Approval Addiction is good but not necessarily great. Joyce on the other hand is great!"
4,Who might be upset with you?,"Can you take criticism? Is there someone you fear to upset? Do you find it more important to be liked than anything else? Do you worry about upsetting the boss? Joyce Meyer says this is all traced to approval addiction. And according to Meyer, the only approval you truly need is that of Jesus Christ. She offers detailed scripture references as well as biblical quotes as evidence. The solid advice here is definitely aimed at Christians or those who are willing to believe. While a bit repetitious at times, the lessons are worth repeating. Those who recognize themselves in her words, and are willing to pray about it, will find great encouragement."
4,Used it for 15 years as an aircraft structural engineer,"It was 15 years a go that I got this book as a part of a lecture by Dr. Broek. Over the years I have come across many books on this subject. I have to admit that this book is one of the best introductory material written on DTA. There are other books with probably additional data, however, what separates this book fom the rest, is Broek's ability to write in a coherent and easy to follow format.Unfortunately, since the book is not in print the price is a bit too steep for a new copy.Also try ""Structural Life Assessment Methods"" by ""Liu"" - sold through ASM."
2,Way too red!,I used Chocolate Cherry back when it went by that name and loved it. This #36 is way too red. I mean carrot red. I had bought three because I hadn't found it locally but now I see that Loreal changed this to having way too much red in it. My hair was orange! Would not recommend it to anyone who wants dark brown with red highlights. This will give you red hair. YUK!
4,Eternity..Awesome,"Having listened to this CD a number of times, I find it to be delightful. All though the first 3 cuts are a little hard to understand as they are sung so softly, the rest are really great!To me the music has such a cool mix, a sureal sound that kind of just floats along. and lets the mind wander. The instrumentals are very fresh and well played. I find this CD very enjoyable and would highly recommend it to anyone who wants a new and exciting listening experience. I can hardly wait for the next CD! I thank you for letting me express my views.J Head"
1,Lufkin PS3430,"Who designed this? You need to add 3 5/8"" to your measurements due to the bulky size of this tape. The back is not square so depending on how you use, say into a corner, it might be 3 1/2"" or maybe 3 5/8"" because the back is uneven. Who the heck wants to add 3 5/8"" to all measurements? Also, I expect this ""add number"" to change as the rubber case wears down over time. The lock tab will wear your thumb out. Get a metal Stanley and be confident that you will add 3"" everytime. I have no problem with seller and I did not attempt to return it. I'll use it when measuring something between 25' and 30'. It's a good paper weight."
1,Didn't work,This flashlight doesn't work at all and unfortunately it's not worth the cost to return it. There's not much more to say.
4,From The Bad Comes Good,"In Paul Gallagher's (older brother of Liam and Noel Gallagher of 'best band in the world', Oasis) book, Brothers From Childhood To Oasis, he describes the horrors of growing up with a neglectful, alcoholic father and the fame and drive to prove yourself that comes from such a relationship. It's a moving and touching story of two young men who triumphed over a broken family life to pursue their dreams - and made it, big time."
5,to move freely,I love to film and having a battery that last longer than 30 minutes cause my love to move freely longer.
1,Not the same No-Ad. This stuff is awful.,I have been using No-Ad Sport for years- was a great product. This is not the same stuff. The lotion went from smooth and readily absorbed to greasy-feeling. They have added scent and a trace some coloring agent. This is not the same product.
5,A joy to enjoy,"An absolute joy, this album is well selected and represented bluegrass music. I highly recommend this album. Whether you already enjoy bluegrass or are testing the waters, this album is a super introduction to many fine contemporary blue grass musicians."
4,Great purchase,"My husband is a huge hockey fan and loves reading this book to our daughter. Some of the references seem a little dated, but that's just my opinion - the book is still creatively written. I'm really glad that we added it to our book collection."
4,"Good ""beginner"" glossary for young hockey fans","This is a decent beginner book for young hockey fans. I would've used different words for a couple of the letters, but overall it is a good book. This is not a glossary, as I originally expected, but instead incorporates some history and legendary players. We take our 19-month-old son to quite a few PENS games, and this helps to pass time at intermissions."
5,Great Book!,This book is great--with lots of info for all ages. My 2 year-old just received it as a gift and loves it. My husband and I are just as interested as he is!
4,didn't read the whole discription,"I hoped this would be an aphabet book, but was too old for my grandson"
2,101 SONGS? You've got to be kidding!,"The Mamas and The Papas were nothing more than a blip on the radar screen of rock n roll history. They had a few decent hits.Some communties sentence you to listen to this set in its entirety as community service punishment. I defy any of you to name 10 Mamas And The Papas songs off the top of your head that were NOT hits.OK GO! I knew it, you can't do it. The best of CD's are more than enough."
2,They added reverb,"The engineers added a thick sweet reverb in remastering. Though very pretty, this takes all of the punch out of the mix and makes it sound like ""Muzak"" for grandma."
5,STRAIGHT SHOOTER,"""The Mamas & the Papas Complete Anthology"" is FANTASTIC! The sound is superb with the harmonies bursting forth through your speakers! Of all my recent purchases, I can't put this set down! Origninally, I was going to purchase their first album ""If You Can Believe Your Eyes & Ears"" but opted for this complete anthology set instead. Boy was I surprised! It is a fantastic package, with lots of historical info & pics, but the sound is what is amazing! The real interesting part of the anthology is disc 4, which contains mainly solo performances after the Mamas & the Papas broke up. I was pleasantly surprised when I listened to it; many great songs that I had never heard! Why there are no plans to release this set in the U.S. is unfathomable to me. You do not need to buy any other Mamas & Papas disc if you purchase this, as it contains EVERYTHING! I can not recommend this set enough! You will be amazed at the clarity of the audio. BUY THIS NOW! YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!!!"
5,Great Anthology,"I already have all of the Mamas and the Papas CDs in my collection, but if I didn't, I would buy this anthology in a New York minute. Great music by one of the best groups of the 60s."
5,Canon EOS 300D Digital Rebel,Godfathers of LA PunkThe Canon EOS 300D Digital Rebel is low-priced and easy to operate. I bought the body for $350 and the 1.8 50mm lens for $80. Within moments of turning it on I was taking fantastic photos. The flash is strong (see photos).
1,Terrible and embarrassing,"What a terrible book this is. As with Citron's other books, this is LOADED with factual errors and misunderstandings of the shows he discusses. The first big clue is that he misspells Andrew Lloyd Webber's name throughout the entire book -- where were his editors? And he says that the period between the 1920s and 1960s was ""a time when plot was secondary"" in musicals. Oh really? Like in Carousel, West Side Story, Show Boat, Pal Joey, South Pacific, My Fair Lady, Camelot, Gypsy, The King and I...? I feel sorry for anyone who wastes their money on this the way I did. Stay away from books by this guy -- there are so many GOOD books on muiscal theatre out there..."
5,This book was inspirational and spiritly good for the soul.,I've had a lot of ups and downs in my life. I believe that this book has helped me and can help other people. This book is good for encourgment to belivers and non. The book helps you to have a different outlook on life. I thought Michael did very well writing to the youth and others as well.
4,Excerpts of Michael's life and lots of apt bible verses,"I didn't expect the book to be filled with about 80% bible verses and only 20% of what Michael has to share. Nevertheless, I appreciate his frank and honest comments which are definitely encouraging, especially to youths. The selected bible verses are very aptly chosen to serve to encourage any believer. It's almost like a highlight of what the bible has to say about Christian living. It's a good gift to Christians and non-Christians alike."
5,Direct Fit.,"I was pleased with the style and fit of these door sill protectors. They were high quality and fit the contours of my 06 F150 dry (without the adhesive tape). With the tape, the install was rock solid and will more than protect the paint and looks great as well. The instructions were easy to follow and installation took about 5 min. per side (most of that was prep). This manufacturer did their homework. I will buy again."
5,A response to the poor review below,"V.L. Mundy's review is, as he or she freely admits, from the standpoint of complete ignorance. Davidovsky is a canonic composer whose reputation is undeniable. This is not to say that a good reputation makes one's music good; it does not. In the case of Davidovsky, though, his acumen as a composer matches his stellar reputation.This recording is very well done with fantastic performances and recording quality. I particularly like Cantione Sine Textu, which creates a sonic world unlike anything I've heard before."
3,Under her spell,"I enjoy this album. I give it only three stars because it is a bit uneven. Nonetheless, the strong tunes are smile provoking and easy to dance to. I find that a song like Dixie Chicken stays in my head for quite awhile. That guitar player sure can play, too. If you are interested in music based on New Orleans Jazz and American Southern Rock, or if you simply enjoy music that is fun to listen to, this album will be interesting to you."
3,Not their best.....,"Hey, it's a decent album, and if I hadn't heard their other works, I might rate it higher. Little Feat never had a gold record and were by both necessity and style a live (as opposed to a studio) band. Yeah Dixie Chicken and Fat Man in the Bathtub are great songs but I much prefer the live version of both found on the Waiting for Columbus CD. In my opinion, Columbus is one of the top ten and possibly top five all time best live albums."
5,A great Southern Rock album,"Years ago my uncle turned me on to Little Feat with this album. I used to sing ""Dixie Chicken"" all the time. I lost the tape on which I recorded it, but happily I found it on Amazon as an MP3 download. All the cuts are enjoyable and fun, but the best cut is probably the title track. ""Fat Man in the Bathtub"" is cute, too. This is a good introduction to Little Feat if you have never heard them before."
4,a nice enjoyable album,"Little Feat / Dixie Chicken: I enjoy listening to this album but it's hardly a classic. Yet, it's certainly worth owning and playing. It is fun but not essential. Four Stars"
3,Good Sample of Steven,"If you like 80's Christian music, you'll like this album. It's a good sample of Steven's early songs, with the ever popular My Turn Now and His Eyes. If you're an avid SSC fan you should definitly buy this album. It certainly demonstrates an early era of Stevens career. Some of the best artists were better before they were popular, is that true with Steven? It's arguable, because his music has almost consistently been good with all albums. See for yourself."
4,FULL OF GRACE,"TUESDAY's CHILD is a collection of Chapman's ""early years"" before achieving superstar status in the early nineties.The usual heartfelt ballads are here, along with breezy pop-oriented tunes and rely on Chapman's exuberant and inspiring vocals.Along with the euphoric title track, other noteworthy offerings include the passionate WAIT; the poignant MY REDEEMER IS FAITHFUL AND TRUE; the clever use of antonyms in WEAK DAYS and the emotional HIDING PLACE.While not his best recording, his fans will probably find it a good addition to their Chapman library."
3,The CD version must be better,"I own this on cassette, but it has only 8 songs compared to 10 on CD. Not a bad sampler, but it is a good bargain."
5,Just what I expected,"I have loved this cd (album first) for 34 years. The quality of the CD was exactly as stated, very good condition. There was also a personal note from the seller telling me to enjoy. I would definitely purchase from this seller again."
3,"Good, but predictable","Although at first this book appears to be about a wild stallion, it really is centered on a father-daughter relationship. The writing is good, but the ending is too predictable, and I felt like the father's change of heart wasn't entirely convincing. I did enjoy the story however. I would recommend this to girls who are looking for horse stories a little ""deeper"" than the Saddle Club series or Thoroughbred series."
4,Practical application and commentary on popular quotes,This smartly packaged gift book helps the reader enjoy inspiring quotes from many noted authors and statesman of our century. John Maxwell provides practical application and commentary on each of the quotes in a way that helps you evaluate your own goals and dreams. The brief quotes can be read in quick 'bites' or feasted on when time allows.
4,Enormous!,"This item is huge. The center pole is wide and it's overall size is just tremendous. It does exactly what we need it to do, but even when I measured it, it still seems so much bigger because of the width of the center pole.It's very sturdy, very heavy, and appears to be extremely well built. If you're looking for something for a small space, or something with a demure profile, this is NOT it. Our ""pewter"" finish is more of a black brushing onto a silver base, so I spray painted it more of a bronze color to match our decor. It took the paint well. This is big big big... but worth the money!"
3,A good jumping on point for new Deadheads.,"Although the songs themselves are for the most part good, they are certainly not the best songs the Dead have done. Rosemary, Mexicali Blues, and One More Saturday Night certainly have no place here. The songs also have no cohesion, as most albums do. But, it is nice to have a live version of Lovelight on here."
2,what?,"There are two main problems with the CD. One is that it features far too many studio cuts for a band that is so much about live performances and improvisation. The other is intrinsic to the nature of the Grateful Dead--they were around for so long, and with them comes a body of music so vast and of so many different styles that it's impossible to give any idea of what they are about on one CD. If you want to get into the Dead get ""Europe '72"" and ""Live Dead,"" and go from there--there's so much amazing music to explore. Don't waste your money on this CD--once you start buying other albums you'll probably never listen to it again. And if you must get a ""Best of,"" get ""What a Long Strange Trip it's Been."""
2,pretty bad compilation,"This is a bad way to get started on the Dead, give a friend Workingman's or Beauty if you must give them a studio album. It's amazing this album stays in print."
4,"Good start, some flaws","This album is great to start on, but i dont think it really shows people who the Dead are. Songs like The Golden Road dont really reflect on the Dead as being a ""Jam"" band. Let alone this album does contain some of the Dead's classic songs such as Casey Jones, Uncle John's Band, and Sugar Magnolia. I fell in love with the Dead when i heard it first, but i was suprised when i heard some of their live stuff because it is not much like a few of the songs on SFTC. I also do not like all the songs and the order they are in. I dislike Lovelight and i think that Friend Of the Devil should be one of the first albums. Besides that its a good album, buy it, then get into some live Dead like Europe '72 and Live/Dead"
4,Good CD,"This is a very good CD for someone who is not a very Big Grateful Dead fan. The songs don't go on, on like most of their songs do. An excellent CD if your not a DeAd HeAd, and just like certain songs."
3,a good first GD CD,"This is a collection of very good Grateful Dead songs, but certainly not the best. This is a good CD to get if you don't know any Dead songs and just want to know what people are talking about, not if you're a true Deadhead."
4,A few great ones,"There are a few good ones, Casey Jones, Sugar Magnolia, Truckin', and The Golden Road. This is a pretty good collection of songs, but as the reviewer below said, there are some out of place songs. Mexicali Blues is obviously out, but overall these are good songs. A pretty good buy, also check out what a long strange trip its been."
3,Great music of the dead but there's something better!,"Only because i'm giving three stars as a reviewers opinion because there's a few songs that can be found also on the Grateful Dead's CD called ""What A Long Strange Trip It""s Been"" album on two double-discs set. Even though deadhead fans reallly hate this one as well!"
5,good cd,"This 5 stars is for the Grateful Dead being as good as they are.As for the album, it's sort of ridiculous to make a best of the Grateful Dead (esp. on only 1 CD) because there is so much good stuff. One thing that I really like about this CD is the fact that it has some great songs on it, and like someone said earlier: It grows on you and prompts you to buy more. This is a good intro to the band, but don't stop after this CD because you'll be missing out"
2,Bare bones,"A somewhat odd compilation of the first five years of the Dead in the studio. The track selection is baffling -- why Rosemary instead of, say, China Cat Sunflower? -- and the sequencing makes no sense whatsoever -- Friend Of The Devil as the last track while Lovelight sits in the middle? The music is generally great, but if your interest in the Dead is strictly casual I'd strongly suggest buying American Beauty or Workingman's Dead instead: both have as many 'hits', if not more, than this collection, and have a bigger emotional impact."
5,For a Change of Pace,"I always turn to this CD for a change of pace from heavy metal that I'm currently listening to. This album always has me appreciating what The Dead did indeed accomplish over their early years. I guess that I really love the combination of folk, blues, and psychadelic genres fused together. This album does not disappoint, with such tracks as Truckin', Sugar Magnolia, Rosemary (a psychadelic but haunting and dark acoustic song), St. Stephen, Casey Jones, and the live and welcome, ""Turn on Your Love Light."" For an even bigger change of pace, there's Mexicali Blues. The Grateful Dead have always been the band that people don't take seriously, yet have the most loyal following. This is an interesting listen from a very interesting band. Good stuff!!!"
4,"UM, YEAH, YOU GOTTA START SOMEWHERE","There IS a newer greatest hits available now that tries to span this bands entire studio career on one disc. Eventually they may try to span a whole live career onto another?THESE ARE THE EARLY GOODS, AND THE ONES THAT BEGGINERS NEED TO KNOW.TRUCKIN, was my first glimpse, and was like my favorite song when I was about seven.GRATEFUL DEAD taught me that skeletons in the closet wasn't a scary thing at all (as long as there was a blonde with him and he was smoking a big fat joint.) They were in fact, quite peaceful.YEAH, if you have no clue about the DEAD start right here. It's cheaper than the new ""greatest"" package and it has the best material crammed onto one disc.If you need more info than thatthen...ST STEPHENUNCLE JOHNS BANDMEXICALLI BLUES and especiallyFRIEND OF THE DEVILdig? The next step is ONE FROM THE VAULT, when you are ready for your head to explode. ENJOY THE RIDE."
2,Not impressed. Get American Beauty.,"When I was just getting into the Dead my dead-head friends would tell me ""whatever you do don't buy Skeletons from the Closet"", now I know why. It is impossible to summarize the grateness of the Dead's 30 or so years with one CD, but it gets 2 stars just because it is after all - the Dead."
3,"Very generic, but a good starting place : )","This cd along w 'What a long strange trip it s been' were the first two dead cd s i heard as a beginner in the music. It was a perfect cd to hear in those cold february Iowa mornigs before heading to class (12th grade). Then they recomended me what a long strange trip. And those two cd s were the ones to get me hooked on this band.I went on to see them 6 times ( This was 1992. Saw 17 Furthur shows altogether between 96 and 98, and am still a huge admirer of this group of musicians.Go ahead, pick this cd up if you re starting up w this band, and then go get What a long strange trip it s been."
4,Victorian detective mystery,"Written in beautifully ""period"" English, this mystery has many threads to solve. The main characters work wonderfully with each other to solve the mystery, with the assistance of the British police. Takes place prior to 1924, in London, and kept my interest until the end. I love the commonsense of the Yorkshire men!"
5,great product!,"i love my new flat iron & especially can't wait to use it in Europe. I've burned my hair too many times on products not made for use in Europe, even though I've used converters on the right setting!"
4,Great for overseas,"The flat iron works great for overseas, it's not as hot as my 'Chi', but it does the job. I have soft hair and I don't get perms often so I rely on my flat-iron in between the perms. The Black Pearl does get my hair straight just not as straight as I like it. I would recommend it as an alternate iron."
4,Worked great in Germany,This works great in Europe. Had a different flat iron last year in Germany and it exploded! Nice job.
5,"Great, great, Bonnie Raitt",This is a wonderfully remastered CD of an early Bonnie Raitt recording. Just to hear Angel From Mongomery is alone worth the purchase!
2,One Of Her Weaker Efforts,"In the ""before Bonnie became famous era"" (all cds prior to Luck Of The Draw)...there were some great records...but this is not one of them. To me this is an overproduced record where the ""music machine"" was trying to get Bonnie out of her grittier (and much better) earlier style and into more of a pablum that could be sold in mass quantities to a 70s crowd. There are a few very good songs here but in general its uninspired and flat. If you are looking for early Bonnie material, stick with her first two and you can't go wrong."
1,Poor Quality,"Cheaply made and of poor quality. Arrived with a large divot in the cork and all of the felt off the back. Needless to say, returned the item."
4,***3/4. Getting off to a good start,"ZZ Top's 1970 debut remains one of their roughest and certainly bluesiest albums.It's a gritty little blues-rock record with lots of fuzzy guitar, rollicking barrelhouse rhythms and a raw, gutsy sound, and ""ZZ Top's First Album"" offers a handful of really excellent songs, like the tough ""Brown Sugar"" (not the Stones song), the swaggering, riff-driven ""Goin' Down To Mexico"", and the slow grind of ""Just Got Back From Baby's"".Some may find that a number of these songs glide by on their tough, gut-bucket grooves without offering anything truly memorable, and while it is true that not every one of these ten songs is an instant all-time classic, the overall level is quite high with several peaks and very few let-downs.This is 34 minutes of tight, well-played blues-rock, as muscular as anything ZZ Top has ever put out. Less MTV-friendly than their 80s pop concessions, of course, but all the more gritty and authentic.3 3/4 stars. Nice."
1,WTF!,Find yourselves the original album or casette and play it for a pure sound. This cd release is remastered with added effects that deletes any history of what ZZ Top's original sound was.
5,What's with the added echo/reverb?,The original album.....did not have the echo/reverb....Hey Billy G....why did you let the engineers change the sound?
1,Do not waste your money on this CD,"I should have carefully checked the reviews beforehand. I don't normally do because I like to form my own opinions but in this case I would have saved money and would not have been disapointed.I'm a great fan of ZZ TOP and I wanted to complete my collection by adding their very earlier stuff like ZZTop's first album, Rio Grande Mud and Tejas...what a disappointment!!! Who's the brilliant person that switched the drums with electronic drums or a drum machine??? Man-o-man what a mistake to have screwed up such classics as these. What a waste, can I return my purchase?"
3,ZZ Top's first,"After ZZ Top had been formed from 2/3 of the American Blues and 1/4 (but the leading 1) of the Moving Sidewalks, came their first album.ZZ Top are a straight-up blues-rock band. They are really good but sometimes they lack variety. Here, they begin with 'Somebody else been shakin your tree', an excellent blues-rock numbers with country guitar and harmony vocals. The other highlights would be the plaintive bluesgrass-rock of 'Old Man', 'Goin down to Mexico' the driving 'Backdoor love affair' and the oddball 'Squank', which benefits from a bit of wah-pedal, I think.Some of the songs are dragged down by uncharismatic vocals from Billy Gibbons, such as on 'Neighbor Neighbor' and 'Just got back from babys' - actually he sang way better on the Moving Sidewalks album. 'Certified Blues' is a standard, by-the-books, blues-rock shuffle. So is 'Bedroom thang' but at least that has charm.Overall, it's a good listen, but not consistently inspiring. 3/5"
3,Just for Starters.,This is a cool album for people who know little about this band yet want to explorewhere they come from musically.Granted it's not their strongest album but it's a good place to start.
4,ZZ TOP AT THERE BEST!!!!,"THIS ALBUM IS WHY JIMI HENDRIX SAID ""BILLY GIBBONS IS THE BEST YOUNG GUITARIST AROUND"" IN A 1970 INTERVIEW ONE OF HIS LAST.THIS SOUND OF WHITE BLUES GRABS YOU BY YOUR BALLS!! AND WILL NOT LET GO UNTIL YOU ARE SCREEMING FOR MAMA!I HAVE THE ORIGINAL 1971 ALBUM ,THE ONLY WAY TO REALLY ENJOY THE SOUND. A CLASSIC WORTHY OF YOUR COLLECTION.BUY IT YOU WILL BE SATISFIED!"
1,Garbage Remix With 80's Gimmickry,"As part of an attempt to capitalize on the success of their Eliminator sound, ZZ Top decided to go back into the studio and remix and also re-record parts of their first 6 albums thinking it would make them more money and entice fans of their newer sound to go back and buy their earlier records. Well guess what, in the process their older fans who were used to the original versions on the old cassettes and albums were shocked when they listened to any of these first generation CD releases. They heard bogus reverbed drums, and entire sections of both music and vocals re-recorded. Talk about tarnishing the legacy of a great band's output. Well someone finally wised up and now at least Tres Hombres and Fandango are now available in original mix, remastered form. So stay away from this trash and wait for the entire back catalog to be released in it's original mix, remastered form on CD."
1,STILL WAITING FOR THE PROPER REMASTER !!!!!!,This is the best ZZ Top record ever. The CD will eventually be released with proper sound. We just have to wait for the ivory tower of Warner Brothers to decree it !! Hope I live long enough !!!
1,For $80 I expected something better,"This mat is hard, thin plastic. For $80, I was expecting something that was thicker and more amiable. The cost to make this thing is probably less than $10. Kind of a ripoff.Addenum:After less than a month of lite use, mat is already cracking and coming apart. Complete junk."
5,Great Item Purchase with CONFIDENCE!! :-),"I put down new floors and was concerned about protecting them. This product is aswome, you can see the wood, roll around with ease and it STAYS in place! I'd buy another one!"
5,Lutheran or not; a must read!,"If you ever want to read theology from a different, evangelical perspective, this is the book! I am not Lutheran but this book is as good a theology as you'd ever want to read. I use Wayne Grudem's ""Systematic Theology"" in my college doctrine classes, which is pretty standard Reformed Theology, but nothing holds a candle to Mueller's profound volume. It's easy to understand, black and white in it's analysis of heresy and legalism, and excellent in its Scripture quotations. We non-Lutherans have missed out on profound insights into Scripture and truth by focusing the debate on Calvin and Arminius and missing Martin Luther--the greatest theologian since the Apostle John finished penning the book of Revelation. Mueller does a great job of reducing Lutheran's theology to a single volume.Get it!"
5,Very readable!!!!,"This book was originally published in the 1930's however is quite readable! I was surprised on the frankness of the author and how applicable many of the topics are today. The author quotes Latin and Greek frequently, however, this will not hinder anyone who is not versed in those languages.Bottom line: if you are Lutheran and want to know the theology of your church, this is a great reference book."
3,Mueller's Dogmatics not just a summary of Pieper's,"J. T. Mueller's one volume Christian Dogmatics is not simply a summary of Francis Pieper's Christian Dogmatics (3 volumes plus an index volume). For example, Pieper has a section on ""The State of Souls Between Death and Resurrection"" (III, 511-15.) I could not find a similar section or similar discussion in Mueller's dogmatics. My guess is that Mueller does not have s similar discussion because he differs with Pieper on the topic."
2,Ear candy pure and simple,"Culture Club made light, fluffy pop. It was pleasant, danceable, and utterly disposable. There are some nice pop singles here, catchy, and hummable, and this is all the Culture Club anybody needs."
1,Outrageous,I was really happy to have found a collection that took me back too the eighties. I was very disappointed with this product. All my favorite songs skipped. It only got worse as I cleaned the disk. Just horrible. I would not suggest any purchase from this site...NO Way!
4,Possibly The Best Budget-Line CD Ever?,"Culture Club have many compilations in print, most of them ruined by having Boy George's later inferior solo work tacked on to it. This budget-line CD is really all the casual fan needs, containing all of the band's Top 40 hits, including the much-maligned (but still fun) ""The War Song"".As is the case with most budget line CD's, I would imagine that the sound quality here isn't as good as on some of their more ""proper"" best-ofs. If you're that big of an audiophile, the recent ""VH-1 Storytellers/Greatest Moments"" collection would probably serve you better.My only complaint - the failed single ""Mistake No. 3"" (a decent ballad) isn't here. Small error though. This is a very good Culture Club greatest hits set."
3,A catchy collection of songs.,"I enjoy listening to this greatest hits package from Culture Club from time to time. Undoubtedly, Culture Club has put out some good and catchy material. This hits collection contains a total of ten tracks which come from four albums recorded between 1982-1986. All of the songs are in a straight-ahead pop musical direction. Boy George is a good and efficient vocalist. Culture Club's musicianship is also solid and satisfying. All of the tunes sport good production, too. I like all of the tracks, but the ones I enjoy the most are ""Miss Me Blind,"" ""Move Away,"" and ""Time (Clock of the Heart)."" ""Miss Me Blind"" is a cool and sprightly song that features a really nice and infectious guitar solo from Roy Hay. ""Move Away"" is spirited and full of energy, while ""Time (Clock of the Heart)"" sports a pleasing chorus. This hits package doesn't contain a biography of the band or song lyrics. I find this collection of songs to be solid, catchy, and enjoyable. Worth a listen."
3,Great Little book,"Being an acquaintance of one of the authors, I bought four copies of Inkplots for stocking stuffers this past Christmas. It was such a unique gift. All my friends loved it. We talked about the book so much over the holidays, I'm ordering six more copies for those I left off my Christmas list. Good reading and a fabulous gift, too!"
3,Good for self study,"I like these little ""Teach Yourself"" books and found this one useful. It's gives good examples (with problems) of the most commonly used programming algorithms and gave me a good set of basics for further study. Pretty cheap education."
1,I guess it is a great case when it is well made....,"Exactly.. It looks great in the picture, but the one that got home was badly made.. the hinge was badly placed wich makes the case not to fit well and one of the buckles has a problem too: It is round..what I mean is that it doesn't have that ""little cleft"" that allows the buckle to stay in place and closed. I wish I could post a picture here so that everybody can see what I am talking about...and what is worse: I live in south america (chile) which makes the process of returning this case a never ending story...I BOUGHT A (WHAT I THOUGHT)PRO CASE..INSTEAD I GOT A PIECE OF CHINESE RUBBISH."
3,Ho Hum,"It will do what it's designed to do, but the plastic seems more like the cheap brittle kind you found on molded guitar cases 30 years ago. I expected this size case at this price to feel a bit more SKB'ish. The interior is pretty cheesy too. Will it hold harmonicas? Yes. Would a shoebox filled with paper towels have done the same thing? Yes."
2,TOO SLIPPERY,"The mat is great to teach shapes and animal sounds. My daughter loves it except she is falling all the time. The mat is too slippery and my daughter jumps from animal to animal and 9 out of 10 times falls. She thinks it is funny but I am not happy about it. We do not wear shoes in our house but I have her wear sneakers when doing this mat, which is inconvient."
4,Jump and Jam Review,"The toy is probably best for children five and under. I found that my seven year old nephew was easilly able to identify and play the game. This was almost to the point of he becoming bored. However my four-year old nephew had to think about it more in terms of the sounds.The only thing is that even though there are different games, there is not that much variation. The game tends to use the same sounds and shape references just to different music or speeds. Best for younger children."
1,talking floor mat review,I bought this item from amazon for my 2 year old son. We did not find it useful at all. It was very hard to use. My son did not enjoy playing with it.
5,The Texan Triumph,The Texan Triumph is one of Altsheler's best. His books are exceptional both in story line and in historical account.
3,Three,This was a Christmas gift for a family member and was a book she asked for. I did not have the opportunity to read it.
1,OSI reliability poor,"Purchased base station, remote units (air, 2x), remote unit (water, 1x).From day one, water unit had issues out of the box. OS warranty service was very responsive, however they shipped the wrong unit. Problem straightened out immediately - props to OS service. New unit failed within 10 days. Methinks there's a problem with said units.Base station also had very poor range. 100' feet advertised was more like 20' if you wanted a reliable connection. True for all sending units, not just problem type with remote water sensor.Will not buy OS anything again given a choice."
3,Check compatibility with base unit,"Compatible only with Oregon Scientific Multi channel receiver models EMR812, EMR899, RMR112, or BAR888. This is not mentioned even on the packaging. Waterproof with outdoor mounting bracket and 10-foot probe cable. Says it has a warranty but provides no details."
3,"universal meets ""tarzan"" the apewoman.","reminding me of those 30s ""tarzan"" films, this universal offering is quite well done within its limits but don't expect too much.picking up where ""captive wild woman"" left off, the film is centred around flashbacks for the most part.i don't understand how and why evelyn ankers received top billing as she is not involved in the plot of the film. her screentime in ""jungle woman"" is a brief appearance in the ongoing inquest scene, and thus she is rather wasted. it is j. carroll naish who should be at the top of the cast as he is easily the central character. he gives the best performance as the scientist who takes a professional interest in the ape/woman ""paula.""one good scene is where ""paula"" stalks her potential prey by swimming underwater by the boat containing her next victim. quite creepy. if only she changed into the ape once or twice, it would give the film a lift.the ending is effective as well."
1,"A dull, listless horror film.","Second of the Paula, the ape woman trilogy, this film plods along. Naish plays a well-intentioned scientist who comes across as a ninny (poorly written script) Acquanetta can't act. A dull film."
2,Will It Work Today? No.....,"This is so much better and more exciting that much of what passes for children's literature today, but it is still better left as a memory of what once was. Tom Swift will stil allow you to recapture your lost youth, but the antics of Danny, Irene, and Joe, ably abetted by Professor Bullfinch are just too much formula-writing."
5,The best T.O.P. album to date.......,"I've been a diehard Tower of Power fan for 25 years, but had somehow never bought ""Live and in Living Color"" until the summer of 1998. The live versions of ""Down to the Nightclub"", ""What is Hip"" and especially ""You're still a Young Man"" make the previous recordings sound dull and uninspired. Since the above three songs are my all-time T.O.P. favorites, I listen to this album over and over again. Can't wait for the new live album on August 3rd...but I'm not certain it could ever top ""Live and in Living Color""."
5,Amazing Funk Grooves,"It's a shame Bob Dole didn't listen to this album, there's so much energy and funky vibes, he wouldn't need viagra"
5,ToP Still Tops My List,"I first heard T of P in the middle 70's. Live and In Living Color is one of the best live recordings around. I had the privilage of not only seeing the band play but also to meet the band in 1980. Even with the changes to the band at that time, they could still thrill the crowd. T of P expanded my interest in music and opened my eyes and ears to a new type of music. T of P's Live and In Living Color is still one of my favorites."
5,So THAT'S funk!,"Y'see I didn't think I liked funk. No, make that, I DON'T like funk, as churned out today, but this is something different. The drummer is crazy, that sax player is crazy, that bass player is even better than crazy, and best of all, not a space invader machine in sight (Or sound...).It doesn't matter what kind of music you think you like, you owe it to yourself to at least listen to this album. Trust me. You have never heard anything quite like it."
4,Spin'n Play Center,"I purchased this for a 5 month old I take care of. He loves it and will play with it for quite some time. Unfortunately, the suction cup does not stick very well and I have to hold the toy on his tray as he plays with it. I find this true of most suction toys for babies and feel toy companies should come up with a toy that will stay put. The Spin 'n Play Center is a great toy for babies. I just wish the suction worked."
2,My 5 month old son pulled this off after two minutes.,"After reading other reviews I thought I'd finally found something that my son couldn't remove. Sadly, he pulled it off after two minutes. It's a very hard toy, so he bonked his head in the process. Then he got it stuck in his lap and screamed.My other problem with this toy is that it is very tall and bulky."
3,Emma And The Outlaw,I enjoyed this book. I had read another in the series and I wanted to know what happened to Emma and the other sister. It was a good story and had a happy ending for the girls. The story of each girl was different and thus was not redundant as some series are.
3,Good story,"This was a good enough installment in this series, although it was my least favorite out of the trilogy. Still, it reveals the story of what happened to Emma, and there were parts that made me laugh with their wit and humor. Not a bad read, just not my favorite."
2,Explicit!,"Disappointing! This was the first Linda Lael Miller I've read. This library find was more than sexually explicit, so graphically and ongoing that I considered it light pornographic. No, I am not prudish! I've read many sexually explicit and sensual writers, however, this novel's puritanical cover distort's the reader's expectations. I found nothing especially captivating about either character, especially Emma. She wasn't strong willed, stubborn, spoiled, manipulating, or even innocent. Emma was oversexed from the moment her maidenhood took flight with the wind. She spent her time coaxing this man to satisfy her carnal desires throughout the book. Maybe Emma was no different from the average 'American housewife', the only difference being that her carnal desires and needs were met. Well, that is a feather in her hat!"
1,Stop!Please make it stop!,"Ok it starts out pretty good but it soon turns. The guy is awful! He's a complete jerk who loves to bend Emma to his will every chance he can. The first love scene he almost has her and that's only after a few days in the book! He doesn't even care that she's innocent or that he's wanted he keeps coming after her! She is so annoying,she bends to him at every turn never standing up for herself. There exactly 8 love scenes and bout 4 half ones were just start out and then it goes to the next scene. Can someone say over kill? Belive me I love love scenes but it just got boring with so many. And what it is up with miss Miller and spankings and beating up of women. Yeah I like my books to be real but I don't want [...] like that in them it ruins the whole thing."
1,Emma and the Outlaw,"The book was in good shape, but the cigarette smoke odor was terrible.I had to cut strips of newspaper and insert between all the pages and leave for several days and then remove to get rid of the cigarette odor. Before I could read the book. Of all the books I've ordered thru Amazon.com this is the first one which was too stinky to read. I will never order a book from that vendor again."
1,Can't recommend,"I have two of these (received as gifts) and they remain in the cupboard. Found them very difficult to use. They always curl up and slide, even when moistened on the back with water, and I finally had to resort to taping them down. Also needed tons more flour to keep things from sticking. Using a countertop was much easier despite the clean-up problem. If this product causes so much extra trouble, why buy it? I recently had the idea of taping them to my crafting table to make an easily cleaned work surface. At least they wouldn't be taking up space in my kitchen!"
3,Okay treats,"These treats are very small, they look like hamster pellets. And the container itself is much smaller than it appears online. You end up having to give your dog so many of these ro satisfy them that I don't think it's worth the calorie difference of other treats. Good for training though."
4,Too long,"This book isn't really good enough for 4 stars, but it isn't as bad as 3. If I could give it a 3.5, I would.The idea behind this book is a good one and the general plot is well done. But there is too much extra stuff (the adopted kids and the endless accounts of repairs are just two).I kept reading because I wanted to finish the book, but I don't know if I will want to ever reread this one.If you like historical romance and can stand long, flowery passages, you will probably enjoy this book. If you like more straight-forward writing, don't bother."
3,Great toy but sound is useless,"We have two corn poppers, one is the classic one that only pops the balls and this one. I find the electronic feature on this one that counts to ten and light up completely useless. When the balls pop, it makes so much noise you can hardly hear the music and counting and the electronics and the batteries add extra weight to it. My toddler goes for the one without the fancy stuff and makes me push this one. Save the extra money and buy just the simple version of the corn popper. But a corn popper is a must. All kids seem to love it, mine is no exception."
3,Mildly hot,"Fine debut of funk-tinged jazz was a worthwhile announcement of an impressive talent, if not a completely compelling compilation due to dated fusions."
3,Swimming Through Life,"This book revolves around a 25-year old college grad with no money, no job, and no prospects, and how he spends the summer. This book has a nice flow, with a gradual redemption plot that reads very plausible."
5,What A Blast!,"Someone brought this game to a party we had and it totally broke the ice. It's like that old game spin the bottle, but it actually talks and tells you what to do. It plays truth or dare with you and tells you to kiss people and stuff. And it asks the most embarassing questions. I wouldn't recommend it for little kids, though. I gave it 4 stars for educational value because if little kids played it, they'd learn some things!"
3,Difficult to cut on.,"This is a huge cutting board, but unfortunately the textured surface keeps the knife from making a clean cut. Also too large to fit in the dishwasher, which I guess is my own fault for not getting out the ruler before ordering.If you're looking for a cutting board that can be sanitized in the dishwasher, keep looking..."
1,"Wish there were an option for ""no stars""","Before I'd even used the cutting board, let alone washed it, two of the four little glass nubs on the bottom that support the cutting board and hold it up off the counter (like short little legs) had fallen off. It seems they were glued on with a very inappropriate glue--The nubs are clear and I can only find one of them, so I can't even glue them back on with proper glue. Now the cutting board is useless because it won't sit flat and secure on the counter. I don't want to send it back to Amazon because it is so over-sized and shipping it will be a royal pain. This is a huge piece of junk. Save your money."
1,Bad Bumps,"The glass surface is dimpled and is hard to clean. The ""feet"" fall off. It feels thin and lightweight - like it will break easily."
3,Wrong Size Cutting Board,"I received the right cutting board, but in the wrong size. I can not returned because I can not pack it appropriately so it doesn't break. However, I'm going to order now the size that I originally ordered because I like the product."
3,Farberware 14-by-18-Inch Glass Cutting Board,"Does the job but not as thick as expected, more easy to bust. Also price too high for what you get."
3,"Very useful, but not as a cutting board","I use these to protect the tops of the nightstands in my bedroom. I don't want the wood to get all scratched up. I would never use a glass cutting board, as it would damage my knives. For this reason, I give it a 3-star rating. It's not really good for its intended purpose."
2,Farberware 16x20 Cutting Board,"The product I received is NOT what I thought I was ordering.Look at the picture it shows the board as ""White"" What I receivedwas a see thru greyish glass board. I called Farberware and theysaid their boards are ""White"" What I got was not White.Believe it or not- had it been a dealer that sold it to me- I wouldhave sent it back but when it is Amazon itself- you jump thru toomany hoops"
2,Just another 3 episodes,"This DVD is really just 3 episodes that happen to have Peter fighting the Giant Chicken. If you already own the season DVD's, no need to purchase this."
4,Much Better,I have a 1971 CB 500... This filter made a world of difference when switching from the stock filter !
3,Cheech and Chong's Sleeping Beauty,"This is one of the albums I never purchased when I was younger. I would classify most of the routines as ""good"" but not ""great"". One of the better routines is Tactical Women's Assault Team. It is a clever routine that ranks up there with Les Morpions from the album Los Cochinos. I am glad I purchased this as it now completes my Cheech and Chong collection."
2,I Need A Time Machine,"Whew..........what a difference 30 some odd years makes. This offering from Cheech and Chong was funny as hell in '76 but the years have taken its toll or maybe my tastes have matured. While not as funny as ""Los Cochinos"" it still does have a couple of funny moments. A time machine might allow me to appreciated more."
4,Dont know yet.,I would love to review this product but to date have not yet received it after 5 weeks. I have no idea how to contact Amazon in regard to this problem.
2,Outdated scholarship,"My review is only for the Greek music section of Sachs's book. I got this book because someone recommended it as an essential complement to my studies of Greek music and theory. Unfortunately, I was bitterly disappointed. Sachs's scholarship is outdated and his research wanting in many respects. The author does not seem to understand much about ancient Greek genera, modes, notation, theory and even less music philosophy. He fails to take into account the fundamental premises upon which Greek music was founded and as a result his examination remains superficial and incomplete in many respects."
3,Fascinating,"This is an absorbing account well worth reading. The oral history segments are fascinating and informative. The scholarly analysis, though insightful, is not meant for the casual reader. Students of Irish politics will like this book, but they may need a political theorist specializing in the body to help them understand the more involved analytical segments. Worth reading."
2,Interesting but difficult to get through,I read this book for a course in social anthropology and while it is a detailed ethnographic monograph it is difficult to understand the language and it would help to know more about the history of the conflict in Northern Ireland before reading it.
2,For the hardcore fan - and only maybe at that!,"If you're reading this review, you probably know all about the Italian 70's jazz/rock band Area. While the performances on this live set are stunning, the sound quality is abysmal - poor even by bootleg standards. For those interested in a live recording of the band, I would strongly suggest Are(A)zione.Are(A)zioneI just wish someone had written this review before I wasted my money on this album. Now that it's here, perhaps I can prevent others from making the same mistake."
3,Not a concordance,"This is a very concise dictionary, and not a concordance at all. Not really that useful."
4,Cute Movie About Family,This is a cute movie about family and the struggles that are faced. it is about coming to terms with the past and forgiving others to find the love that exists. It even has a little romantic story.
5,Simple times are the best.,It is nice to have a special movie for Thanksgiving.As with Christmas the Thanksgiving holiday is a specialmemory brought about in it's simplicity. This movie shows that.
5,Great holiday movie.,This is one of my daughters and I favorite holiday movies.we make sure we watch it every thanksgiving.its a must see
5,a wonderful holiday drama,I have watched this movie over and over. It is well written and the acting is superb. It never grows old. Amazon verified purchase
4,Good ending!,"I was surprised as I watched this film. The characters did things I didn't expect. It was interesting to me; I didn't know the story before I watched it and somehow, what was happening didn't sound like it fit the title. By the time it was over, I was glad to have watched it and would recommend it to others."
4,A good Thanksgiving movie - not many around,"There are not many Thanksgiving movies around, so this is a good one to add to your holiday collection. The pace of the story is a bit slow, but it does not detract from the film. It has a good message to it - especially for the Thanksgiving holiday. Jacquline Bissett is very good in this movie. The young lady who plays the main character (I don't know her name) is a very likeable character as she tries to heal the rift in her family.Thanksgiving seems to get lost between Halloween and Christmas, so it will be nice to have this on DVD to help keep the holiday important to my family.If the price of this DVD stays at $23.00 upon release, it is a bit pricey (which is why I gave it four stars). If it is priced lower, consider this a five star review."
5,An Old-Fashioned Thanksgiving,"I love this movie.Based on the short story by Louisa May Alcott, the author of Little Women. Well written. Awesome cinematography. I just adore this period."
2,She Should Sue,"I would have given this one star if it weren't for the fact that this gloriously gifted artist has moved me so with her better work. To have her singing ""There's No Business Like Show Business"" and other show tunes mocks her talent. And ""Those Were The Days"" in three additional languages? What were these record producers thinking? Mary Hopkin was badly used in this collection. And why did they discontinue ""Earth Song/Ocean Song?""The ""Those Were The Days"" collection, with the exception of ""Que Sera Sera"" was excellent and earns five stars, especially for the last track, ""Water, Paper, and Clay."" THAT is Mary Hopkin, a woman with a very old soul."
5,Folk Wisdom,"Never mind the pundits, and the all too hipsters...Mary Hopkin's ""Postcard"" is a folk album that is hauntingly beautiful. Don't be persuaded by snot-nosed critics... Think for yourself, listen for yourself and enjoy for yourself."
3,Pretty good,"I also use my body wash as a shave lotion in the shower, and this one is thin compared with both the Dove and the Olay versions. The price was better, but since it is more watery, I end up using more.The fragrance is very light and dissipates quickly, so that's a plus for people who may be sensitive to fragrances."
1,DESCRIPTION AND PICTURE NOT RIGHT,"I cannot find Ivory Fresh Snow anywhere in stores and was excited to find it here on amazon. I ordered 2 bottles. When I received them, they were not Ivory Fresh Snow. They were Ivory Very Ivory, which I can find in any store. Just be aware that the descriptions are not correct."
1,I was fooled,"I've been looking for this product everywhere and was excited to find it on Amazon, until I received my order. I was shipped an old bottle of hand soap that looked like it was about 10 years old and possibly from another country. I will say that I received a full refund, but my search for Ivory body wash continues."
3,Would be better if it were received already,Not sure what the hold up is - I have not received this product. Not like there should be shortage of license plate frames on the market..... I'll like it better once it arrives.
3,Very fragile,"Great overall look, but very poor quality. Be very careful when handling, and don't put it on a vehicle that you plan on taking on any back roads where rocks my fly up and break it."
4,very nice gift and very good price,"i couldn't ask for more ,,i just started 4 month ahead my christmas shopping and this a very cool gift for one my friends who love the seahawks and the price u cant find anywhere else"
5,review of book order,Arrived promptly and in good shape. It was a gift and the recipient and I were both very pleased with the quality and timeliness.
2,Is this vinyl just 1 defective out of a bunch?,"I just got in Deguello on Vinyl and many of the tracks skip while theres not a sratch on it. My needle is fine and other recordsplay perfectly. Side A, 3 tracks skip, side B, 1 does. Although on the packaging it say ""pressed with more care than ever"", I'm wonderring if I recieved a defective copy from manufacturing. This is a great album and unfortunately I'm liking my copy."
4,Last Decent ZZ TOP Album,"This album was released 20 years ago. It is the last decent ZZ Top release. Forget buying anything after this one because everthing released in the 80's and 90's is MTV garbage. Deguello looks like it may be OOP, but the search is well worth it 'cause it is a heck of an album from a band that seems to have lost their way."
2,"CD ""Deguello""","The CD was not what I expected: The title was ""Deguello"", and I thought that specific tune would be the lead to the album. However it was not even included, and I guess that's my fault for not reviewing it properly."
5,An awesome ZZ Top album!!!,"This album(CD) from ZZ Top is awesome!!! Contains the classic tracks:Cheap Sunglasses,I Thank You,Manic Mechanic,and I'm Bad,I'm Nationwide!!! The other songs on the album(CD)are great also!!! A classic album!!! Two thumbs up!!! Five stars!!! A+"
5,blues don't get no better than this!,"hard to believe you guys don't carry this one any more. I agree it is the pinnacle of ZZtop's work! I have followed the progress of Billy Gibbons since the mid-60's in Houston, and I think these guys are the most underrated talent in the universe, especially in terms of their influence on hard-driving blues music...."
5,books,I was looking for this book which was my children when they grew up and my son wanted this book and a opossum puppett to go with the booki ordered 4 books from this seller 2 looked brand new and 2 looked gently usedgreat pricewonderful value
5,So fun to read aloud!,"As someone raised around southern folk, it was difficult to not read this aloud with a drawl. I think even non-southerners will have a hard time not slipping into a drawl! I bought this before my daughter was old enough to care, and honestly, I had so much fun reading it that I didn't mind if she was listening. The story is really cute too, and you can't help cheering on the possum!"
4,Possum Come a Knockin',"This is an imaginative and melodic book that will mesmerize children. I am a preschool teacher, and this book is a favorite of mine :)"
5,possum come a knockin,"one of the very best books for little people, to encourage reading and the love of reading!"
5,An album for everyone,"You don't have to be a lover of traditional Chinese music to enjoy this album -- but if you are, you will all the more appreciate this CD's breadth of expression. Some pieces are decidedly traditional in flavor (Spring Arrives on the Qin River, for example); others are crafted with a Romantic flair (Beautiful Africa); still others belong to the realm of folk music (Tibetan Dance) -- but all are unmistakably Chinese. The entire album is compiled with a keen sense of balance and ""flow."" Sisi Chen's playing is breathtaking, and she truly tells a unique and living story with each piece. Once heard this album will surely become a favorite."
4,One happy dad!,"My father has read this book from cover-to-cover numerous times. He has also passed it around to his friends and fellow co-workers. They find the information to be very current, the writers knowledgeable, and the book easy to read.It covers many aspects of the RV lifestyle. The book gives tips on everything, from suggested itineraries to meals (even recipes!). (I would elaborate more if I could only pry this book from my father's hands!)This book was ordered sight unseen but, as always, Mr. Frommer delivered. As a Flight Attendant, he is the only travel guide I follow!Special thanks to him and the authors for compiling all the information that went into this book.Happy Trails!"
2,Frommers Exploring America by RV,I found this book to be trite and very limited in scope. Perhaps someone who has never gone rving before might enjoy it. Some of the mishaps of the authors were almost impossible to believe considering they are both educated people. Very disappointing.
2,"If you want detailed trips in the U.S., this is a good book.","The book opens with a couple of good chapters on the basics of RB'ing and gives an excellent diary of their first trip which made me feel better. However, chapters 4 through 13 are detailed examples of trips in the U.S. which i will not be takin any time soon. Chp 14-16 review RV types and manufacturers."
4,Remote,Product as describe......works fine. It was a challenge to program. But the included instructions helped greatly. And at a fair price!
5,Sturdy,Pretty impressive. I've have this stuck to the back window inside my Nissan pickup with the arm fully extended and its being used as a cup holder. I can honesty state for the record that its been in the same spot for about 3 weeks without it falling off. Very impressed with the sturdiness and would highly recommended it.
4,A beautiful book; the best journal/baby record we've found!,"This is a beautiful record book of baby's first five years. I've looked all over for a baby book that wasn't too cutesy, too commercialized (i..e, Pooh is great, but I didn't want a theme like that for our baby book), and with enough pre-defined AND flexible space to record items of importance in our baby's early years. This book is PERFECT and includes space to record many things that I may not have remembered to note."
4,Good present for parents who get a baby,"I give this book to parents who get a baby as a present. I spent a day finding a good baby record in Barns&Norbles and Babyrus. This is what I found. I'm satisfied in terms of the quality of binding, contents and thickness of the book."
5,Excellent,"THis is THE book for Big Breast lovers, which, in this modern age, is a relatively rare phenomenon."
2,Cries for Blu-Ray treatment.,The good: well danced and orchestrated. The bad: 4:3 aspect ratio. Washed out colors. You can get past the poor colors and aspect ratio but why should you have to. This performance or a new one cries out for the Blu-Ray treatment.
5,Delighful and not to be missed.,"The Australian Ballet company does a fine job, again. The dancing is on the order of the children's characters in the Nutcracker Suite ballet."
3,Not what I expected,"This book is NOT about the German Valkyrie operation, but about international arms deals of the 1980's that culminated in 1990 in Chile. It is fairly interesting reading, but less so if you are expecting something else."
5,The best of the best,"I'm shocked that this album has received anything less than five stars from anyone. It's easily my favorite Feats album. Not to denigrate the other songs, but with ""Long Distance Love"", ""One Love Stand"" and, especially, ""All That You Dream"", the other songs could be covers of the 1910 Fruitgum Company and it would still be a great album. ""All That You Dream"" is not only my favorite Little Feat song, it's possibly my favorite song, period."
3,Beware!,"Please be aware that the 2012 Rockbeat re-issue includes 6 ""bonus"" tracks, 5 of which have been previously released. These include four tracks that were released on ""Hotcakes And Outtakes"" and one which was released on ""Waiting for Columbus"". The only track that has, apparently, not been previously released is a mono single version of ""All That You Dream""."
1,digital files???,why are the digital files not available? Now i have to go find them on other sharing sites and the artist will recieve no benefit when i obtain them. Idiocy
3,The Feats Start Running Out of Steam,"Unfortunately, this album saw Little Feat starting down their long trajectory to musical mediocrity. Lowell George's problems began reducing his influence over the band, most of the hooks were gone, and an increasing jazz influence resulted in more fusion-type noodling and fewer funky Southern grooves. Furthermore, the band was apparently discovering synthesizers, which begin to make their unwelcome presence felt.This is not a bad album, but it's unfortunate that the title turned out to be false advertising."
2,Little Feat's laid-back album,"So what happened? Did Little Feat feel too relaxed after making ""Feats Don't Fail...""? I've heard and read lots of good reviews for this album, but sadly, I have to object. I've listened to this cd quite a few times, but the pretty ballad ""Long Distance Love"" is still the only song I can remember anything about. Even the playing somehow feels routine, more uninspired than previously. This disc is somewhat saved by the inclusion of the two tracks which had to be left out from the single-disc edition of the live double album ""Waiting For Columbus"" (the cover of C&W band Fraternity Of Man's ""Don't Bogart That Joint"" from the ""Easy Rider"" soundtrack is short but hilarious, and seems to go on very well with the audience despite the subject matter). You should invest on that one instead, and preferably on the double-disc edition that contains previously unreleased material as well."
2,Clay,"This clay stains clothes and hands, leaves greasy stains on paper - can also be sticky and hard to remove from objects."
2,Hard to read,This book teaches you a lot of good techniques in motorsport.But one thing that I dont like from this book is that it's little bit harder to read than other books I have read.
1,Pass it up,"First off, racing is door to door and wheel to wheel. Solo or autocrossing is not racing. Fun with cars, yes. But not racing.This booklet is a waste of paper. It's for the guy who wants to talk about autocrossing to other people who've never done it and never will. No organization, stick figure drawings, stuffed full of ""job descriptions"" for working at an autocross with no usefulness except upping the page count. The ""modifications"" section is worthless.He talks of ""weight transfer"" when he really means inertia loading. He attributes cornering forces to the mythical ""centrifugal force"" and talks of your body being forced outward, when it's the car accelerating towards the center of the circle.The first chapter of Skip Barber's ""Faster"" has more useful information than this entire book.Oh yes, no ""secrets"" are revealed."
4,Good price,Our clients seem to break the majority of our easels and spending $110 vs $230 was a sure bet on replacements!
5,Love it!,This is by far the best presentation easel I have ever used. The all-in-one approach with the easel support and the board it self is a brilliant concept. Having both sides of the easel available to write on is another great bonus. I use this alot when training and presenting. Easy to carry in your car. I suggest getting an easel zippered carry case to prevent the easel surface from getting scratched or otherwise damaged.
3,Not a bad product - But arrived broken,"Product wasn't bad. It does seem sturdy. It is not a magnetic white board. However it arrived so damaged I had to return it. The box looked like a semi full of wolves ran over it, stopped, backed up, wolves got out and attacked it. Bottom rail of the board was bent and broken. Too bad."
4,Sturdy and functional,"Requires two people to set up, but once it's set, it is sturdy and functional. I've been using this with middle school youth. It works well, though I have noticed that the youth sometimes have a habit of stepping onto the bar between the front legs as they scribe."
5,funny and fascinating,"This is a very well written story set in the US Navy of the 1960's. There are fascinating insights into the operation of the Navy -- how aircraft carriers work, how navies are supplied, how spying missions are flown, how American and Russian navies get along on the high seas.But at a deeper level, it's a story about how the US Navy can be a family to its sailors. The main plot is the hell that Cap'n Fatso can raise, when his fleet abandons him and sails for Vietnam. Intertwined with it is a story about how Cap'n Fatso mentors young sailors, protecting them from harm -- he even sets up a casino, serving beer, so that young marines won't be corrupted by landside attractions.I enjoyed it."
5,A truely great comedy,"Dan Gallery has captured the less seen side of military service - the people in uniform living their day to day lives. This book is a real gem for its humor and playfullness. A great read. Having been one, I couldn't stop laughing at the antics of American sailors."
5,Gallery at his funniest,"One of Daniel Gallery's funniest books. If you like military humor, this one is a must. sure do wish Gallery's books were still in print, they are so hard to find."
4,Quartet Cork Bulletin Board 18 x 24,Board is very good and looks as pictured. Only negative is that the board plus backing isn't very thick. Push pins go through and could scratch or mark wall or panel cork board is hanging on.
1,Erroneous information in some parts of the book.,"The book is written okay, however, some parts of the book are reflecting seriously falsified materals. In articles of Armenians in Ottomans, and Armenians in USSR there are some statements such as ""...set out to punish the Armenians on amassive and indiscriminate scale, by resorting to empire-wide massacres that lasted from August 1894 to September 1896 and claimed some 250,000 to 300,000 direct and indirect victims..."" which makes me wonder how the ARMENIAN author comes up with those numbers without the reference?!Generally, the book includes genocide and crimes that are part of the history and the ones pushed into by false articles."
2,A complete work but not partial,"One will need literature more critique with the Western world (markets, companies, sociobiology) to complete this book, or you will have a partial knowledge of the history and causes of this phenomena. Although it is an encyclopedia, there is an unbalanced weight in the topics with the serious absences commented before.These volumnes must be completed with ""Late Victorian Holocausts"", M. Davis and others, to coverthe the reformulations in sociobiology performed by Galton, and its influence in the British Empire and other countries. These are very alive in the billion victims in the Third World.This encyclopedia ignore the genocide in India with 30 billion victims explained in the Davies book. In a general way, the 3 volumes are quite benigne with the Anglo world, ignoring the ideological roots of the actual financial power and his real role in modern genocides (Congo, etc..)."
2,cooler,"Vertex CoolerThe insulated liner is stiff and higher than the zipper, making it difficult to zip the cooler shut. The easy access zipper on to is not easy to unzip one handedly."
5,wild plum jelly,"I have tried this product before, love the taste and would highly recommend this to everyone."
3,Surebonder Light Tacker,"I have the Surebonder Light Tacker, Model 5540Hol. I love it. It's great for installing strings of holiday lights because it comes with a supply of 5/16"" staples that are shaped to accept plastic insulators to protect the wiring while fastening it. It is powerful enough to set the staples securely. The insulators protect the wiring from being cut by the staple. The legs of the staples are also wide enough clear the wiring without knicks. It's a pleasure to work with. I would rate the Light Tacker higher, but I'm having difficulty finding refill staples and insulators. I've had to e-mail the manufacturer for assistance."
1,This thing is crap,"It's a cheap plastic staple gun. You're better off using a real staple gun with wire tacking staples, then trying to get this this to make it."
2,Wind of Promise,Have read all od her books and these last two are not as good as her others Would not recomend to friends..
2,Not another witless heroine!,"This is only my second Dorothy Garlock book and I am very disappointed. I love her writing style and the detail that she includes. However, I found Vanessa to be a shrew and a control freak and it became increasing harder for me to like her.I hate when heroines, in an attempt to show their strength and independence, do foolish things like help in gunfights when their help is clearly unnecessary.In Wind of Promise, the heroine does this three times. After the second time, our wonderful hero explained to her the danger to others that her actions were creating and I thought - ahh, now she will stop. However, she did it a third time so I turned off the Kindle and won't finish the rest of the book.Also, our hero fell in love with her much too easy and early when she was still being shrewish, unkind and they hadn't had any true conversation."
1,Didn't Last 3 Months - No Customer Service,The phone quit working in just over two months. Repeated calls to the customer service phone number would automatically put me on hold for a long while and then tell me to call back later.
1,Avoid this phone,"I got this phone free after rebate. That said, this phone wasn't worth the price to me. It has one very bad feature that overrides all of its other features: when the battery is low it will beep until you place it in the cradle. As fate would have it, it usually beeps in the middle of the night. I guess if you are the type of person who keeps the phone in the cradle at all times, you would find this phone satisfactory. I don't. One other thing, even with the ringer off, the phone needs recharging about every five days. Compared to my 10-15 year old Panasonic phone which needs charging about once every three weeks, this phone isn't very good."
4,Great value. A terrific set.,"This TIE Fighter is a great LEGO set. It will fall apart if handled too much, but it is very durable if you just leave it alone. One thing I don't like about it is that it uses blue bricks for the wing patterns, not grey as shown in the movie. I also don't like how when you open up the cockpit, the front piece comes up too, unlike the Darth Vader TIE fighter, which only has the top part come off. By making the front part of the TIE fighter come up also, it will come off because it isn't on a good hinge. I really liked the addition of a stormtrooper, which is the first Lego one ever. I will probably buy Ewok Attack for another stormtrooper. If you have Vader's TIE but you don't have the regular TIE, buy two so you can create the scene of Vader with his two wingmen. An awesome Lego model! Perfect for Star Wars freaks like me, or Lego collectors!"
5,"""display stand""","The TIE ""display stand"" actually is used for refilling the fuel tank. Also, TIEs cannot land on their wings without damaging them. The ""display stand"" is of much use."
5,An impressive recording,"This has been one of the most impressive recordings I have heard. The sound is so innovative. The quality and performance of the musicians is also very admirable, specially of bassist Omar Hernández. There is a variety of rythms and themes, all of them performed with great gusto. The musical ideas and arrangements are of superb quality. In my opinion, this is a ""must have"" CD!"
3,Golden Dreams,"The heroine of this story is Lucy Hubbard,who took over as Sheriff of Nowhere California (a former gold boomtown) after her father's death. The hero, Luke McKenna, arrives back in town after serveral years away,hoping to find gold on his old claim. Luke is asked to help Lucy rid the town of some rowdy outlaws and later they end up sharing work digging for gold. Soon they find that they are very attracted to each other as they spend time together. Nice romance with a different twist,both characters are likeable and the romance between the two very sweet."
2,Useful for SAHM,"This is useful a book for stay at home moms or those who can nurse their baby on demand. But it is quite difficult to follow, if not impossible, for working moms. I was hoping that there will be a section for mothers like me who needs an alternative aside from doing the actual nursing but sad to say, it did not provide that."
1,Eco. breastfeeding doesn't always work.,"I guess I'm just blessed with an early return of fertility, despite following the rules. Read this book, if you feel you must, but also keep your NFP charts.Having children close together is not the end of the world. Maybe God's will?"
4,Did you really listen to this?,"Wayne Pernu (Amazon reviewer) - With all due respect, did you listen to this album? He's done many great recordings, but this is one of his best. This pushed the limits and explored new ground in every respect. Please listen to it again.Michael Hatton"
5,i'm bopping till i drop,"what kind of knucklehead would not like this album. yes album I believe this was the very first digital rock and roll album. ry has been one of my favorites for some time. The man has got away with the guitar that only a few have been able to touch. He is one my very favorite slide guitar players ever (rip lowell george, duanne allman). David lindley is the perfect complement to him on this album. So are all the players and singers. So I have one thing to say one thing to however did like this you need to get rhythum and really listen."
5,First digitally recorded album,A great record/cd by a great guitarist. From the opening notes of Little Sister to the closing refrains of I Can't Win showcase this fine artists skills and abilities.
5,boogie time,"This is one of the best slide soul albums around. The arrangements are fabulous and the playing is excellent. It is an album that once listened to rings in your head for days. When you least expect it on a bus, in an elevator, or at work you will find yourself singing one of the songs. Ry Cooder's expressive play is straight from the heart and he knows how to pick his band and singers. This album will stay on or very near your stereo from the first day you put it on. Another recommended album, and one of Ry Cooder's best is a live album called Showtime. Incredible."
3,Kaleigh likes her,"we bought this for our grandaughter, Kaleigh's 7th birthday. She likes her and had a lot of fun playing with her but---even though the ad says she's designed not to flip over--she does. We had trouble getting her to skate on the kitchen floor so took her to the patio. She did much better and actually there was a lot more space to play with her. She still tipped over but not to often. Its a real good deal for the price though and I'm glad we purchased her."
1,Didn't work from day one!!,I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. It never worked. We had new batteries but it still didn't work. We had to take it back to the store and I was never able to find another one there. ... I'm afraid to try another one. ...
1,Cost of Batteries not worth,"When I purchased the item, description says it takes 5 AA batteries but ultimately I found it takes 6 AA batteries and a 9V battery. I am trying to return the item since cost of batteries are not worth eventhough item price is worth for keeping the doll in shelves."
5,My Tenchu 2 review,"Man, I played this game for about 2 months, and I must say even though the graphics aren't ""state of the art"", the game play and story line is incredible. This game kicks [behind]. Missions, Missions, Missions! Items galore and Ninja moves to boost. And after beating the game, you get an extra character. Love it man, if you plan on getting it, it'll be your money's worth."
3,An OKAY game,"Tenchu 2 was great at first. I was excited, the way they moved, and could kill their enemies w/ little movies of stealth kills. But after a while, it began to get boring, and I didn't play it. The way the game workd, is you go through levels, and at the end of the level, defeat a boss. During the levels, instead of going slow and making everything stratagetic, (if that's a word) you can just easily run through the whole level. Then the boos is WAY too hard, and you almost always die, making you start in the beginning of the level again. I would say that this game should be bought by those who don't mind semi-good graphics, and a horrible scenario maker."
5,tenchu2,fantastic I like thegame bestever thegrapics are great sound gives a super lifespan defiendnitly best and gameplay hardcorechampion!!!bec ILIke Ninja game ihope they willbe some tenchu4 thats all and god bless yougamemasters
3,Rudolph,"This game has taken some heat from professional reviewers for not being up to the caliber of the original Syberia. In some ways, I agree with those reviews. As a stand-alone game, I don't think Syberia 2 measures up to the first game. HOWEVER, this is a continuation. Playing Syberia 2 without having played Syberia is akin to opening up a 1000 page novel and starting at page 500, and then wondering why you don't care much about the characters. Yes, Syberia 2 picks up exactly where Syberia left off, and for fans of the first game, this is great. It means there's no contrived rehash of events or reintroduction of characters. The story just moves along. In fact, I'd like to see Syberia 1 and 2 bundled as a single, huge game, since that's really what they form.The beginning of this game is actually a bit better than the beginning"
2,OH MY GAWD!,"This game is bad. I loved the first Tenchu game, and the PS2 version rocks. The entertainment factor here can best be described as standing on a packed bus on an 95 degree day, with no air-conditioning....someone crapped thier pants...you don't know who, the bus stinks, you just missed your stop, and the next stop is not for another 20 minutes....yeah it's that much fun! The game play is rough, the landscapes are not interesting, and it lacks all of the fine tuned quality of the first game. You are constantly fighting the camera angles."
3,"great game idea, but not enough effort was put into it",The idea of being a ninja is a great game idea.I mean who wouldn't want to run around cutting people's throat? On a game of course. The game could be alot better.The graphics are terrible and it isn't realistic. Correct me if i'm wrong but I think the more realistic a game is the more fun it is. I hope if one of the creators for this game read this that they will make a much more realistic 3rd to this genre. Like I said before it is really a great great game idea but alot more effort should be put into it.
5,Blown away,"Wow I enjoyed this game. After going through trival boring game after game this one has made being a game freak worthwhile again. If you love just plain killing and the whole ninja lifestyle this is the game for you. Using your grapping hook to sneak up on your poor enemies, stealh kills and sword play like I have never seen before except for in the original Tenchu. This game is GOOD. The violence in this makes Mortal Kombat look like day care with it realisticness Don't take my word for it buy it and become addicted like I did."
5,This is paradise found!,"Easily one of Van's top 5 efforts Veedon Fleece is truly remarkable! From the gentle intro ""Fair Play"" through ""County Fair "" This is journey that will capture your heart! It is almost criminal that so few people have heard the magnificence of the song ""Streets of Arklow"" let alone the rest of Van's catalogue. Arklow paints a picture of this Irish town captured in time. ""Comfort You"" has become a one of the great lost romantic classics. I rank this up there with Moondance,Astral Weeks,and No Guru, No method, No Teacher. Van, thank heaven, is a prolific producer of music and has no less than 25 titles out. It is also fair to say that no one should own less than 10 to 15 of these.No exaggeration! Van Morrison is master artist who unfortunetly will only receive his due recognition after his demise. This one is 5+ stars. Thank GOD for Van Morrison!"
5,He really doesn't get the credit he deserves,"This is simply my opinion and I don't want to be a preachy, but this is probably one of the best albums I've heard. Not many people can sing like Van. I'm not talking about how long he can hold a note, but how much soul he can put into his words is just amazing to me. For me, this album is just great art and to try to describe it any better than that would be impossible."
4,A solid album from a great artist,"The only thing ""Veedon Fleece"" lacks is a couple of truly transcendent songs to elevate it to classic status. Even so, this is a very consistent album with no truly weak tracks. The sound is quite minimalist for a Van Morrison album with limited accompanyment on numerous tracks. ""Fair Play,"" ""Cul De Sac,"" and the haunting ""Country Fair,"" are probably the best songs, though it is really hard to choose. Overall, a very worthwhile listen, especially for Morrison fans."
4,In good condition ....,"I am very happy with the purchase through Amazon, the CD arrived and the condition is very good, there are no scratches on the CD even though it is old. This is a beautiful CD by Maurice Sklar 'El Shaddai'. Thank you."
2,Up to 75 gal?,"Works well, but a bit small even for my 45 gal reef. When it comes to protein skimmers the bigger the better!! Live and learn shell out the extra bucks and get one rated two to *three times your tank size."
5,Good basic ball,"Good basic ball for lot's of different exercises. However as a tired mom, just really feel like using it as a pillow."
3,Not at all the miracle product they make it out to be,"The product is good yes, but you still need to use some elbow grease even after applying the product for days on glass doors/windowsThe previous tenants of our apartment were not very clean so the shower window and doors (glass) were stained VERY bad. After a few weeks of using this product I was able to remove most of the stains but it's just not good enough to remove everything 100%I guess it did kill all the germs but I need something stronger for those glass stains (hmmm... maybe acid? lol)"
2,Prince's first album has a only a few good songs but...,"Those are great songs. In a slick funk vein. ""Soft and Wet"" is irresisble as is ""In Love"" but other than that, the album is dull."
4,Prince - For You...,"A good introduction from the then 19 year-old. This album was a foreteller of the things to come. ""Soft and Wet"" was the signature song on this album. I bought this since (1) It was remastered and (2) The price was right ($7US). Four Stars for Prince's first album!"
3,Only the beginning!!,"For you is just a taste of what's to come. Soft and Wet may be the classic, but the albums high point is tracks 5-7. The beautiful Just as long as we're together, Baby and one my all-time favorite Prince songs, My Love is Forever. An excellent start for a gifted artist!!"
3,The Beginning,"Prince's first album. It's not great, and the only song that stands out is ""Soft and Wet."" There are a few glimpses of what would become his signature sound, but they are buried beneath the late seventies disco beats. This album is for diehard fans only, or for those interested in the disco scene. Casual fans should stick to his classics as this sounds nothing like the ""Minneapolis Sound"" that he would create a few years later."
2,Prince's Debut,"For You is the debut album from Prince. Just nineteen at thetime of its recording, the Minneapolis musical prodigy showed flashesof greatness in some areas, but the overall album isn't very good. Itlaid down the blueprint for his future music, funky grooves, sexuallyexplicit themes and a multitasking Prince. Songs like ""Soft& Wet"" and the title track are strong, but the rest of thealbum doesn't amount to much."
2,Nothing earthshattering but Prince is born!,"This is not classic Prince. It's his debut from 1978. While is has some good dance numbers, Soft and Wet is the best track here. However that cannot make up for the 7 mediocre by-the-numbers dance urban r & B funk disco-ish songs that are left on this. Better days are aHead, only Prince is born out of this."
1,so this is how the horror started out?,"When I first listened to this album, I was like ""what the heck?"" and I really hate disco so I hate this album. His voice sounds too feminine too. Soft and wet is the worst song ever!"
3,great debut a mishmash of stevie and smokey,"Not bad debut album by the one and only Prince Rogers Nelson, it seems he was searching for his own voice in this Stevie Wonder/ Smokey Robinson inspired songfest but there a couple of classics in ""Soft and Wet"" and ""Crazy You"" the latter which has been covered by many artists and to think this guy was 18 years old and Warners let him produce and arrange this album. (that does not happen anymore.)He would go on to produce more classic and fuller albums but this is the start of the artist i call the most influential singer-songwriter of the last 25 years."
3,This was a good starting point for the Artist!!!,"Although this was a good starting point for him, I gave him 3 stars, because of what we now know of his skills. Prince wasn't as free musically then as he is now. We need to consider that. This was a new thing for the 70's. This was a new sound out of Milwaukke(hope I spelled it right) that people were getting a whiff of. Prince may not have been so dynamic on this album, but it IS his essence that flows through each song."
3,This was a good starting point for the Artist!!!,"Although this was a good starting point for him, I gave him 3 stars, because of what we now know of his skills. Prince wasn't as free musically then as he is now. We need to consider that."
4,The World Was Never The Same,"The first time I heard 'For You' (9/78)I was floored, to think a 18 year old kid had put together all of this alone (a little production help). Can you say Genius, nothing could stop me from buying everthing with his name on it, and nothing has. Don't hesitate this one IS a piece of history."
5,Birth of a Genius,"Even as a kid he was producing, playing every instrument, peforming great solos and showing immense range of musical styles. Needless to say, in 200 years or so this album will be required listening for students of music ..""Prince 101"""
2,nothing special,soft &wet was great just as long as were together is good the rest of the album doesn't forecast what prince is really capable of.
5,Wife is nuts about this stuff,"My wife bought this stuff when she was down in New Orleans recently and brought it home for my birthday dinner this last weekend. Now I rate this sauce ""pretty good"", but she and our family were mucho impressed. Nice and tangy without being too spicy. I'd recommend it. I'll order some more when I've got an order over $25 so I can save on the shipping."
4,Addictive,"When I first tasted it out the bottle, it tasted average. But then it sat in the fridge and I guess all the seasonings came out. I couldn't stop tasting it out of the bottle! It has a sweet taste and is addictive. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 is because it's a bit thin. The consistency is more like a marinade. I think BBQ sauce should be thick. But I think they have a thick version so I'd recommend buying that. Other than that I'd give it 5/5."
1,On Reprinted editions,"I can't imagine many people buying this book in the first place, but I purchased it to help with a project I'm working on. I was quite excited to see that there was a new edition of Thomas Carew's poems on the market. There's a very well done collection of cavalier verse that was recently put out. It's a Norton Critical Edition entitled Ben Jonson and the Cavalier Poets, released in 1974 that has a great selection. This book, however, is merely a reprint of an edition printed in 1899. Nowhere in the Amazon description of the book does it mention this, which I find downright scandalous. Scholars take their books seriously, and if the edition in question is a reprint, especially a reprint of a 100 year old book that is most certianly outdated, it should be noted somewhere on the page. I am severly disappointed. I doubt anyone at Amazon will come across this review, but I hope if they do that they address this, because it is a serious issue that could be easily remedied."
5,Dark Moon; unicorn in the city,"This is a good book as a sort of upgrade for My Little Pony fans. If you ever wondered what would happen to a unicorn in a human town, here you go. Ms. Pierce also brings in (hooray!) narwhals, who belong in any unicorn novel. I'd like to know more about speeding up gestation of foals, but hey, I guess unicorns are different. Just as I'll never get to taste the flowers of the milkwood tree. Pooh. I like the story. A previous reviewer complained that the unicorn turning his horn and hooves to sparkmakers was a lame superpower; not so in a primative society.I like this series, and have returned to it again and again. This is the second time I've bought this book; that is after I read it in a library copy. I'm also very pleased with the covers. They are very beautiful and painterly, I am sorry I could not find the artist's name anywhere. Those works should be sold seperatly."
1,Extremely Disappointing,"I got this book last Friday. I'd read The Birth of the Firebringer years ago and had been looking for the second and third book in the trilogy ever since. I have to say I was greatly disappointed in this second part of the trilogy. Aljan is dragged out to sea and winds up in the land of the two-foots without memory of who he is, knowing only that he must find the secret of fire. A good concept, but poorly pulled off. Pierce loses the sense of magic and adventure that was such a big part of the first novel. It's also much darker than the first and third. You don't really feel like it fits at all with the other books. The only places it ties in are the beginning and end. It feels more like an interruption than a continuation of the original story line."
1,Where's the Red Thai???,"Purchased these for someone that loves HOT foods. Very, very disappointed! They do not have any Thai heat and flavor."
5,DL HUGHLEY is phenomenal as usual.,"If you like Bill Maher, you will love DL Hughley.I will watch anything with DL, even if it is just an interview. He is funny of course, but his social commentary is needed. The fact that he can make you laugh your butt off while speaking truth, logic, and reason is just genius.This video is great."
4,Solid product at a value price,I recommend this First Aid Kit for its completeness and its organization. It has first aid items that will come in handy for most minor injuries. The clear plastic dividers make it easier to find what you are searching for. I wish that it had a tube of ointment for cuts and burns instead of the small packages. I augmented my first aid kit with saline solution and Glucose for personal needs.
2,An adequate pocket manual for internal medicine.,"Created as an alternative to the more traditional Washington Manual, I fear that this handbook falls short of its goal. In its effort to present data in a succint list like format, it has lost the subtleties necessarry to assist physicians in training in making informed decisions. I do not discount the possibility that its newfound popularity is a result of the fact that this handbook is smaller and fits better into the pocket of a lab coat. An adequate handbook for internal medicine, but far from the best."
2,What Were They Thinking?,"It doesn't matter how good this book is - and it is a good reference - the binding is a joke. Crummy weak wire is barely able to hold 1200 pages, making the book completely annoying. Don't buy it unless you plan to keep it on your desk."
4,easier to use than Washington Mannual!,"In my opinion, it is easier for medical students to use than Washington Mannual.If you are medical student yet, I reccomend this one.If you have read through it, it is time to buy Washington mannual."
5,The best quick medicine reference!,"This is by far THE best quick reference for the Internal Medicine resident and the med student on a medicine rotation. I'm about to order my 3rd copy. It beats the Wash Manual hands down, because it ALWAYS has what I'm looking for - differential diagnosis, pertinent clinical findings and lab values, and treatment. I especially like the section on differential diagnosis of abnormal lab values (what else causes peripheral eosinophilia besides asthma?). And, if you truly want to add extra weight to your lab coat and make your shoulders ache even more than they already do, this does fit in your pocket (Wash manual doesn't)!"
5,this book is great!,"I heartily concour with the other reviewers that this pocket guide is great. I got a copy a few months ago but did not give it serious attention until last week when I needed to brush up on some topics in IM, in preparation for the USMLE Step III exams. Particularly, I was interested in step-by-step, practical management of certain conditions (most textbooks do not help here; they seem to pour everything on you, and expect you to make the right decisions).I found Ferri's book both comprehensive and easy to use. It goes into unbelievable details for a book of its size, and it made the management of medical patients much simpler, by emphasizing the practical aspects of medical care."
2,Poor quality,I bought this item as a gift for a 7 year old girl but after receiving it I decided against it. It is poorly made. The photo shown fooled me.
3,Not made well,"I got this at a discounted rate - thank goodness - because it's not worth paying much for. The frame was bent, the sticker on the camera was faded, and the album was poor quality. Despite the lack of quality with this product, my daughter did love snapping away and thinking she was taking pictures of us."
1,evil spirits masquerading as good ones tell a ridiclous story,"Walter Hinz was a self styled mystic who went into trance and channelled spirits who gave this account. Walter had no way of knowing who was telling the stories he has published and swallowed this load of lies like there was no to-morrow! Earthbound, low grade spirits have had a party here, the book is full of rubbish and is a huge load of rubbish. If you are looking for some true spiritual teaching get into White Eagle and see and read the difference in the messages, the way the stories are told and the simple beauty and lovingness with which White Eagle speaks. There is a world of difference between the teachings of WHite Eagle and the teaching of the spirits which Walter Hinz channelled. Sadly, Mr. Hinz was fooled and published a ridiclous and stupid interpretation of the beginning of God's world and the story of evolution. This is pure garbage!"
4,Not a Real Imaginative Collection But Great Tracks,"They seem to have spent all of ten minutes putting this collection together - not to knock the songs - all pretty good to great renditions or originals, it's just that you might already have most of them but they do sound pretty good togther in this short CD.BTW, the missing artist info:Cadillac Ranch-Rick Trevino (not Springsteen but a pretty cool rocakbilly version).Speed-Montgomery Gentry (fun country rendition).Race is On-George Jones (always good to have George Jones).King of the Road-Roger Miller (like you'd want any other rendition?)"
4,Very Good Novel,"Based on a WWI myth about deserters living beneath the savaged ground of no man's land, this is a very well written and often gripping novel which is required reading for anyone with an interest in the First World War. Hill creates realistic characters with depth and feeling and motivations that challenge the reader to understand their sometimes brutal actions. The situations are most often within the realm of belief and the philosophical debates subtle and profound. An overlooked and underrated literary effort to explore the insanity of war in a fresh way that rates as an overall success."
5,GREAT Game,This is a great game that provides excellent learning opportunities. My 7 year old loves playing this game and I love watching him learn about how to interact the shapes to accomplish the goal on each level.
3,snapshot of a by-gone era!,"Personally I don't really enjoy live performance video. I would have given this compilation 5 stars had it less live performances. Maybe these bands just didn't make many videos so Cleopatra records had no choice but to include a bunch of live stuff. Overall it's a good mix of artists but I suspect half of them would not hesitate to reject the genre brand of Industrial Music. Aside from all that, I'm happy to own it!"
1,This is not about THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION,I purchased this video thinking it was about the Industrial Revolution and it was not. It should be called the really BAD MUSIC Resolution.
2,I had to return this book,"It just didnt answer the bio medical questions I had to help my son. Still learning and reading, but this book wasn't ""complete"" for me!"
2,Doesn't Apply to me,"I suppose this is a good book for parents of children with autism. My child has a speech delay and I was wondering if there was a possibility he could have autism. The only thing this book did was pretty much confirm that my son does not have the disorder. The only reason I am giving it 2 stars is because the content doesn't apply to me. I was sort of hoping for more symptoms/stories about children diagnosed with ASD and less information on how to get help, etc...Otherwise, I suppose it deserves more stars if it was more applicable to me. Also, I've done so much research on my own about the subject, that the first half of the book was information I was already familiar with, so that was disappointing. In fact, I had to skip through much of it because it was redundant, but if you don't much about the disorder, then this book is a good resource."
2,not helpful to us but could be for others,This book was not especially helpful in our case as it caters especially to autism and if you have a child with another special needs diagnosis it will not be very helpful to you.
3,great expectations--very disappointed,"I had great expectations for this book and was very disappointed. If you have a child ""somewhere"" on the spectrum, you might be like me searching for a comprehensive book that details characteristics, dev info, etc on every part of the spectrum, instead of spending hours sorting through all of the web-based mumbo-jumbo about autism. Just give me the facts.However, I won't bash this book completely -- it is useful for helping you navigate ASD resources and the slew of doctors that you will face and how to negotiate more early intervention services for your child. The book just isn't a ""guide"" as the title suggests -- although the author tells where else to go for more information."
1,Not Enough Info,Shopping for something to buy. Site does not give enough information as to what the program does.
5,"Excellent Product, Average Service","This product was as described and was shipped by the deadline, more or less, although I believe that had I not reminded them of the sale, it would have fallen through the cracks and been late or forgotten completely.Because I had to ask if the sale was going through at the last minute, and because there was no ""Ooops sorry, we'll expedite that to you for our goof up in the warehouse ""(why do they always blame the guys in the warehouse, is it their responsibility REALLY???, but I digress) I am forced to rate them as average, and suggest that any prospective patrons that read this review monitor their sale carefully to ensure they're not forgotten as I was.In a Brick and Mortar store, this would be the same as requiring people to take a number, and then skipping it and not acknowledging the person whose number is being left behind as they try to get the clerk's attention.And then getting dust for attitude."
5,Amazing book,"I chose this book for a book report in class and it is such a touching story. If you love animals this is an amazing book and the authors husband is in the video of the reunion for christian the lion which I found interesting. If you're sensitive to hunting though, don't read it."
5,Born Free,"This book touched my heart, to actually realize how one woman could bome so close to animals that we look at and call beasts. The compassion that one woman had is enough to change they way you may think about how we live. And once you read this book, dont forget that it is a true story. After seeing what Joyce had done wither her love for animals, any dream can come true."
5,An exciting adventure of a growing lioness.,"""Born Free"" is about an orphaned lion cub, named Elsa. Elsa grows up with a game warden, his wife, and thier safari crew in northern Kenya, Africa. Joy Adamson,the game warden's wife, mainly raises Elsa herself. The book describes thier strong bond and crazy adventures throughout Elsa's life.This book is very enjoyable to read, and the pictures are a delight to look at. It is exciting to read about Elsa interacting with the other wild animals and then going home at night to a totally different world. This book was extremely hard to put down, and I would recomend it to all animal lovers."
5,What a GREAT true animal story !!!,"I'm a twelve year old boy who loves animals. My mom gave this book to me and told me that I would love it. She was right. The Adamsons raised this lion cub named Elsa as a pet and then had to release her later into the wild. They tell what they had to do with her before they could release her. Elsa is so heartwarming and the pictures in the book are neat. The relationship that the Adamsons had with Elsa was unbelievable. I would find it hard to believe that someone would NOT like this book. I would recommend it to anyone, any age. I am getting ready to start the next two books by the Adamsons about Elsa."
5,An excellent story for animal lovers worldwide.,"This story about Elsa, the lioness, can inspire anyone to realizethe importance and wonder of all earth's creatures. Joy Adamsontells it in a way which everyone can understand how the lovefor a wildcat can be undescribable and can last a lifetime."
2,BEWARE: what's pictured is not what you get,"what you actually get isn't what's pictured. what i got is a plush godzilla that's roughly the same size as described, but his mouth is wide open and his tongue is sticking out. his eyes are also not looking in the same direction, which makes him look kinda drunk. overall it's ""ok"" but i would've have wanted the one i see pictured here..."
4,Christmas Present,"I got this plush toy for my niece, whom I'm adamant to raise as a Godzilla fan. I concur with the other reviews about the size of this toy - it is at least as big as expected, if not moreso. It's pretty solid in design, as opposed to floppy, soft, or squishy. Once she opens up this present, part of me hopes she loves it. Part of me also hopes she doesn't, so I can keep it for myself. :)"
1,Johnny rotten releases dance albums now! He went electronic!,"I can't believe none of these people who gave ""Bollocks"" five star reviews haven't heard of Johnny's corporate company called Public Image Limited. PIL should be the band getting five stars, not the Sex Pistols. John Lydon's gone ALL pop since 1983, so stick that in your pipe and smoke it, you ill-informed safety-pinned freaks. Get with the times; John's also gone ALL electronic and has released a solo dance album that actually has him singing (by the way, his REAL singing voice sounds like the lead singer's voice from Pet Shop Boys, if that's any confort to you... I know it is to me).""Nevermind the Bollocks"" is more mainstream than PIL, with amelodic tunes such as... well, all of them. And every Pistols song is packed to the brim with political fluff that Lydon didn't even believe in. He was, by the way, Malcolm's puppet, and that'swhy he broke away from him to do PIL.The Sex Pistols are ... That is all."
1,One of the worst albums ever- easily!,"My good gracious, this album is simply appalling! The Sex Pistol's other album, ""London Calling"" was pretty bad too, but this was simply awful! If you want REAL punk, check out Green Day's album ""American Idiot"". I think Green Day has a thing or two to teach these talentless clowns!"
5,Gotta love the Sex Pistols!!!,"This is one of the greatest old school punk rock records ever. Some of the lyrics are a little too ""dirty"" but the beat is amazing!I can't live without this album.Literally, this record as shaped the way punk is today.If Johnny Rotten,Steve Jones,and Paul Cook hadn't tried to put this record out on the market (Sid Vicious didn't help them record Never Mind the Bollocks...), God only knows how punk would be today!"
4,The Sex Pistols Good or Bad,"This is a generally a good album, God Save The Queen and Anarchy in the uk are some of the best 'classic punk' songs out there. My dad got me into punk and this was one of the first bands i ever heard. Having a long time in punk since i was just a wee child i feel that this a some fairly hardcore sketchy music. It feels rough but of the time. It is well worth listening to and is to great to cruise and skate about listening to. Well worth getting and will keep you entertain for a while.Proberly the best thing is that all the songs have a fairly different feel.Yeah i rekommend this album for you people out there."
2,"Super Deluxe ""Swindle"" Edition","Love the Pistols but I can't find anything here I hadn't listen to 10 or even 15 years ago [not paying nearly $162.00 for one unheard demo] and a replica of the God Save The Queen single no thanks. Where's the good stuff like the live shows [Longhorn ballroom, the last winterland concert or even Japan 96 I know there are a few shows that were filmed and heavily booted] Where's the real love for this band I just see this another money grabbing attempt *nothing new* =( A super deluxe ""swindle"" indeed a true fan would avoid this expensive mess. The Filth And The Fury film is a better value than this put together just for *Filthy Lucre*"
5,The Best,"This is the best album ever. Perfect in every way. He who does not like it, in fact does not like rock. If you are more into samba, rumba or cha-cha-cha, than you will probably HATE this Never Mind.The Sex Pistols did not need to record another album. This is their ultimate one. Whatever other album would be necessarily worse than this one Bollocks..."
5,A classic despite any other opinions...,"You can say what you want about punk, but the Sex Pistols made it bigger than anyone else on here who trashes their style. Yes, they were loud and obnoxious, but they were doing what they wanted to do. They weren't just all sitting around one day and Rotten says, ""Oi, you know what would make us blokes a few pounds? Lets basically lead a genre of music."" Nothing of the sort was said, I assure you. Not to mention, need I remind anyone that Siouxsie Sioux from Siouxsie and the Banshees, as well as Billy Idol, were big Sex Pistols fans? You can watch the Filth and the Fury and the documentary points out Siouxsie and Billy in the crowds. Before you decide to label this band as a talentless punk band, give 'em a listen."
1,Punk rock was garbage,"Punk rock bands like the Sex Pistols are one of the dumbest fads of all time. There's nothing more annoying to listen to than some moron screaming into the microphone about how he ""hates society"" or whatever. Don't you punk rockers realize that the Sex Pistols weren't really rebels, but were actually just a corporate creation designed to make money? How can you take these fools seriously? Anybody with half a brain would be able to see right through this band's pseudo-rebellion. They only reason this band existed was to fool a bunch of bratty suburban kids into thinking they were rebels when all they were really doing was buying into a corporate marketing scam and generating millions of dollars in profit for Malcolm MacLaren. This band was TOTALLY fake and DEFINATELY not for real. The only reason to listen to The Sex Pistols is if you want Malcolm MacLaren to make more money."
1,thank goodness punk rock has improved,"Cheers to the band for pretty much starting the punk rock genre, but really at this early stage punk rock is really awful. The Sex Pistols have a really annoying singer, unmemorable songs, and a pretty stupid name too. When I listened to this album I found myself constantly wanting to do something else as the dull tunes rattled on. A word to the M Saylor reviewer: the world does not revolve around the Sex Pistols, and stop calling Green Day, Simple Plan, and Relient K junk because I doubt you've even listened to them. This band is really trashy, conclusively. Don't get the CD, but if possible get their decent hit ""Anarchy in the U.K."" I do like that one."
1,"THE Most Overrated ""Artist"" In Music History!!","I guess I will never understand the accolades given to Johnny Rotten and company. Then again, I have never accepted ""punk"" as a form of music because it takes NO TALENT WHATSOEVER to play a generic pair/trio of chords. Just learn to play guitar for a few months and you'll be able to ""play"" this garbage effortlessly.If you want to learn the true definition of garbage in music, all you need is one listen. Then again, I have never been able to endure five minutes in one sitting. I guess I prefer music with melody, passion, taste, lyricism and a given level of musicianship. You won't find any of the above here!"
3,More of a historial document,"Listening with modern ears, the Sex Pistols are a pretty mediocre band. If you have any interest in the history of rock music, or of punk in particular, then this is a required album to get simply for it's historical importance. These guys were on the cutting edge at their time. An important album, but not necessarily for the music...Recommended."
2,"All attitude, no talent","I was fifteen when this album was released. I loved the attitude; so ""in your face"" and antagonistic that it felt like an act of revolution to play it loud enough for your parents to hear. I think that some of the reviewers here are giving five stars because of what the band and record MEAN to them, instead of rating it as music. Because any honest assessment of this band would reveal thier total lack of musicianship and the fact that the lyrics are juvenile at best, and that the recording quality stinks. Some will say that this is all a part of the punk attitude and that stripped down, bare-bones sound without studio fluff is what they were after. If you admire them for setting out to make a crappy sounding record, that's fine, but don't try to pass it off years later as some sort of masterpiece just because it's old. It's still just as crappy as the day it was released."
2,Don't let the hoopla influence your buying decisions,"Alright, so punk wouldn't have existed without the Sex Pistols. In fact most of what we now call rock and roll wouldn't be nearly the same. The fact remains that Never Mind The Bollocks isn't a very good album. I listen to music for music's sake. I listen to black metal bands that growl, but the vocals on the Pistols' album are just irritating. Some Punk fans would say that's the only way to get their message across. Maybe true, but it doesn't exactly make me want to listen to that message. And isn't that the purpose of music? That you actually enjoy listening to it? Much in the same way that Nirvana's imitators often surpassed them, the bands that followed the Sex Pistols, like the Clash, actually made punk a legitimate musical style. This album, with the exception of God Save the Queen is just overrated dreck."
4,Highly energic punk rock,"We all know who the Sex Pistols are. I'm not very interested in the business of Lydon or Malcolm McLaren. Lydon was an arrogant sod and the albums he've put out after Flowers Of Romance are... well, not very good. Still Nevermind The Bollocks is a brilliant punk album. There are a few not-so-strong songs such as 'No Feelings' on this LP, but most of this album is a total blast. Steven Jones is a brilliant guitarist: I'm amazed how he manages to get the guitar parts to sound so good, using only two or three chords. A classic."
3,OK OK OK Album,"This album is neither groundbreaking nor excellent. It is an okay album with about 4 standout tracks (most notably, ""bodies""). To honestly put this band in perspective, consider their reunion. Oooh, that wasn't rebellion, was it. This is about money, which they made loads of. Not essential unless you are an avid punk fan"
4,"problems, problems, the problem is you . . . (if u don't buy this!!)","the sex pistols are byfar, one of the greatest punk bands in history. all the songs are filled with distortion, heavy guitars, screaming, and drumming. i love it! my favorite song from this album is ""problems"" and ""god save the queen"". i think motley crue does a cover of ""anarchy in the u.k., but nothing compares to sex pistols version. sex pistols are much better than The Clash!"
5,Never Mind Green Day Here's the Sex Pistols,"Being 17 I wasn't alive during the 70's Punk revolution. But This my friends is more punk then any of the crap coming out now (AKA: Green day)! I liked the Clash and heard this group was an insporation of theres and gave it a try. Yes, they pack more of a punch then the Clash but hey, There two differnt groups. One of the best punk albums of all time! Face it kids Punk is Dead. It did after the Sex Pistols and The Clash were but to rest. So put down your suger coated Green day and try the Sex Pistols!"
4,The best?,"I love Anarchy in the UK. It is an anthem for the angry. I just don't get the whole best of punk reviews. Don't get me wrong, they have some great songs for the short amount of time they were out. I don't know if anyone has said this in a review of the Sex Pistols but this is their only real studio album. The others are thrown together messes. I love EMI, Anarchy in the UK and like the rest on this disc. My favorite song by them is not on this, Friggin in the Riggin. I hate to do this but maybe check out the hits disc, it has all of these or at least all of the songs on this worth listening to and has Friggin in the Riggin."
4,God save the Sex Pistols!,"The Sex Pistols were a band surrounded by scandal, thanks to the girlfriend-maiming Sid Vicious, and their tunes have been overlooked in recent years. ""Never Mind the Bollocks"" is quite possibly their most famous album for it is the one that houses the classic ""Anarchy in the UK"". This album is a must-have for fans of early punk."
4,"Punk my #$&, it just rocks!","Its a shame that the sex pistols dressed up and acted like drunken fools. Anarchy in the UK, God Save the Queen, Pretty Vacant and Holidays in the Sun are great rock songs. They did not need the hype. The songs have stood the test of time.What a bunch of losers. If they would have stayed together and developed like any other band, they definitely had potential. Although PIL basically sucked, the second album was very innovative with a couple of cool songs. Lydon was one of the first to experiment with dub and Keith Levene and Jah Wobble were really cool, innovative musicians Too bad Lydon has alway had his head up his rear end. I hope his public persona is an act b/c, if not, what a jerk!"
3,"Jumpin' Jiminy, what's all the fuss about!","Let's ignore all the hype about the image and the antics of these anti-social jokers. If you are in the mood for some snarling raucous punk then this certainly will hit the spot. I like it, but I couldn't listen to this or anything like it non-stop. No doubt that God Save The Queen is a punk classic - ""she ain't no human being"" - what a hoot. Bodies, EMI, and Liar will also get your toes tapping. As far as the Pistols being pioneers or godfathers of the punk movement I would say that's a bit of an overstatement."
5,Made a Statement That's for Sure,"""God Save the Queen"" = single greatest song to blair out your window as a teen. Especially in crusty well to do burbs. What's not to love about this album? It's genius. It had major impact on music, fashion/style, attitude. Ignorance is not bliss in this case. I think it played a substantial role in society - at least in pop culture -leading the way for so much of what we take for granted today; now typically lacking the ""wow"" factor."
4,Worth Owning...,"This is a pretty good album. Not as good as any album by The Ramones or The Clash, but still worth having as part of your CD collection. Why bash Green Day? Green Day is a teriffic band, and their CDs are better than this one, I must say. The best song on this album is ""Holidays in the Sun"", in my book."
4,Confused,"Punk kind of always existed but the sex pistols finally made it a genre. They were the first to try this sound that mixed zero instrumental talent and offensive screeching vocals. Definatley not the most talented band ever, but definatley one of the most interesting. A revolution in music, but burn it of the internet instead of buying a cd you wont really want to listen to over and over."
1,The Greatest Rock'n'Roll Hype,"Pure crap. It is just amazing that some critics praise the band and anything it produced. About its sucess? Well, prefab stupidity like KISS, Marylin Manson, The Monkees and ABBA, to name a few, sometimes hit the big time. Sex Pistols is just another example.If I want to listen to punk rock (whatever it means) then I'll favour Stooges, MC5 and the clownesque masters of the genre, Ramones."
1,The below 5 star reviewer is naive and a sucker,"If you bought this album instead of Britney, you should be banished from civilization. These guys are poseurs. They do NOT know what they're doing! Just wait for the new Justin Timberlake."
1,Sex Pistols=Most Overrated Band Ever,"I don't see what the big fuss is about the Sex Pistols. If you ask me, they just straightforward sucked, and even Johnny Rotten admits he can't sing. It's just complete crap, and had the Sex Pistols exsisted today, with underground music at all, they would have never been so revolutionary. Get Dead Kennedy's and Descendents for good punk."
1,uhhhhhhhh,"this music has no message!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!A few main points of this song are Quote""Anarchy in the uk""""I want to be anarchy""Does that send a message!!!!!!!!!!It just a bunch of corperate idiots who try to keep peoples minds off ofreal problems."
1,The Sex Pistols ...,"I hate the Sex Pistols. I bought the album and then sold it the next day. ""Isssss this tha uk-yah!"". SHUT UP! I can't listen to that annoying whine without gritting my teeth and stabbing my ears. Screw their faux rebel image and wanna be Stooges riffs. You Pistols fans think you're any better than the 12 year old girl next door with the Sum 41 shirt? They're a joke and so are you. My only regret is that I couldn't give this album 0 stars. Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!"
1,"sucks, sucked, still sucks","From the first sound of goose-stepping to the last faux fart, Never Mind the Bollocks is a homogenous, shallow, stagnant pond of infantile chord progressions, inane lyrics, and prissy snarling. If their pimp/haberdasher Malcolm McLaren really believed in the punk ethic he would have picked up a guitar and started playing himself, and if the losers in the band believed in punk they would never have let themselves be managed by the Big Mac. The Sex Pistols were McLaren's tin-eared interpretation of punk rock's real soundtrack as performed by MC5, Iggy, & the Dolls. Punk rock can be bitter tonic sometimes, but it's music, it's invigorating, it's liberating and it's not the Sex Pistols or this stupid album."
1,A Sucker Born Every Minute,"P.T. Barnum knew it, and so did Malcolm McLaren. He made suckers out of a lot of us, including so-called rock critics. Barnum also said that no one ever went broke underestimating the taste of the American public. McLaren proved that it's still true."
1,"Great for 13-year-old boys, but....","This is pop music that yer mom would like if it weren't for the explatives. Punk rock is for those whose attention span is too short for a King Crimson album. May I suggest listening to Captain Beefheart & His Magic Band, who John Lydon worshipped when he was a lad? They are noisy, so Mommy will leave the room, and are talented enough that you wouln't feel stupid for listening to them when you're out of middle school. Trout Mask Replica is a great place to start."
1,Rubbish!!! A one star stinker!!!,"Put some make-up on, mess-up your hair, bite your lower lip, and play like crap...that's the formula used by the Sex Pistols on this, the most pathetic testament to noise pollution since ""Dr. Zaius Sings The Monkees."" The problem with punk rock in general is that it's soooo phony, and there's nothing denying that here. The anger is forced, the music boring, and the message is a cliche wrapped in a Bazooka Joe comic. If you're a mall chick who just got cut from the pom-pom team, this album might make you feel better. But, if you appreciate true music from the heart, don't bother."
1,Why do you people bother?,"Someting tells me that the Pistols, the Ramones, the loathsome Green Day, and the rest of the genre could have achieved as much musically if they had been playing car horns and trash cans as opposed to musical instruments. Do you self-deluded ""rebels"" really think that punk was about liberation and freedom? It was about finding a new way of separating a bunch of gullible, immature fools from their money. Mission accomplished.""Pogo On Dudes!"" Duh."
1,I hate the Sex Pistols,"The Sex Pistols are a horrible excuse for a British 1st wave punk band. If you want the real deal, get the Clash's first album, early the Damned, The Boys, Slaughter and the Dogs, or Eddie and the Hotrods. If you want something harder, try the slightly later offerings from Sham 69, The Business, GBH, or The Exploited."
1,Overrated. Poorly written.,"Seriously. I was bored through most of this album. There were only two songs on here that I liked, and those were 'Holidays in the Sun' and 'Seventeen', and they themselves get annoying after a while. The song's lyrics are moronic, and I'd rather listen to a Dead Kennedys or Crass album any day. Those two bands were truly great. This...is just garbage."
5,the best punk CD you can buy,"Just because it's old doesn't mean it's outdated. This is a perfect CD for true punks who stay true to their roots. The controversial lyrics, simple but scathing guitar sounds, and Johnny Rotten's blisteringly beautiful voice make this a great CD. The release date may be in '77, but the sounds still stay with more recent punk. Remember your roots! Without the Sex Pistols, punk would never have gotten its foothold in the music industry. They paved the way for every punk band after them, from The Ramones and The Clash to Rancid, NOFX, The Misfits, The Casualties, and Black Flag. This CD is the best Brit punk CD you can buy."
4,A wee bit overrated.,"To look at this objectivly, the Sex Pistols DID bring punk up from the filthy streets into the public eye. But what did they do when they got there? The Sex Pistols themselves could've and should've been more. But the album is grand, with Rotten's vocals harsh and raspy, lyrics above the bar set by people influenced by them, and a good enough concept of the guitar and its uses. All in all, if you wish to be considered a ""punk"" nowadays, you MUST sing the praises of this album. For that reason I recommend not owning it. But I digress, it is an above average record. I suggest you invest."
5,The Sex Pistols in the album who elevated the Punk-Rock,"Since the punk was born, the world didn't happened a great band(exceppted The Ramones) like the Sex Pistols.The carrer of this band is not longer, but make a revolution in rock and roll.""Never Mind"" make the top of Punk albums in my opinion.""Anarchy in UK"" was a massive and expressive punk song, who make a several critic for the Queen, in the 70's.In the years when the contry have problems economicals, strikes, this album is a rebeld work, who elevated the punk-rock.THIS ALBUM FOR PUNKS IS ESSENTIAL"
5,Generation Defining,"Well have read a couple of reviews and just threw them....this album was the defining moment for all the music that is being heard this present day.In 1977 we were all on a hangover from ""Dinosaur"" rock still....and who should emerge with one of the most potent albums in years...yes the SEX PISTOLS !They for me being someone who was growing up on ""middle of the road pop music"" from America and even the UK (i am in Australia) was like the ultimate smack about the head....it made me think that hey music is alive and confronting the older generation of my time.....and it was !So for this reviewer it isnt just all music but a society smacking LISTEN TO US.The music on the album is absolutely fantastic and (christ am sounding like a hippie).....but it is damn ass kicking make a statement feel empowered ultra fantasmagorical !!!"
4,A must own,"This is the first ""real"" punk album i ever owned and when i hard it was powerful and kicked a lot of ass. The songs on here are chock full of witty cynicism and johnny rotten is hilariously brilliant ( too bad he became a stupid fart). Best songs: ""holidays in the sun"" , ""sub-mission"", ""bodies"" and ""pretty vacant"""
2,Hold On To Your Older CD,"I feel stupid. I bought this remastered version at the store the other day for almost twice the price of the un-remastered version, excepting better sound (and it also had nicer packaging). Boy, was I wrong. The remastering renders the album with almost no bass whatsoever. Really, I almost can't hear the bass guitar at all, except maybe on Submission, but it's still way too soft and flat even on that song. With no bass to hold the sound together, the guitars and drums end up sounding like noise coming from a cheap radio.Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love the music itself, but I'm thinking about returning this version for the earlier and cheaper Virgin CD, which I've heard is supposed to sound much more like the original LP. Some people may really like this remastered version (like the reviewers who gave it more stars) and that's great, but for me, it just doesn't work."
5,Listen to History,"Yes! this is one of all time best rock albums, specific punk-rock.Ok, face it, imagine yourself in 70s , almost like our days a severe crisis (oil...)...,unemployment rising.So punk, was the answer,grab a guitar, join your friends, and play, express yourself.Buy it now."
5,Awww. come on!,"I went through and read some of the 1 star reviews of this album and have to say that i was pretty surprised. I mean this album while not musically extraordinary, was excellent and ground breaking. The Sex Pistols were not about hype and publicity. I was a teenager when this came out and all the hype them was about their live shows and the antics they pulled on stage. I remember my mother forbidding my to buy this album for that reason. Big mistake on her part. Most of you snot nosed kids who are complaining about this should listen to your punk icons when they say this band was a big influence on them. And if thats not enough than why is ""Anarchy in the UK"" probably the most covered punk song of all time. You should grow up and give credit where credit is due!"
5,"Once cool to like,","now cool to trash. Such is the fickleness of the populace. Is this record contrived? Yes. Is the joke on you? Yes. Is it alot of fun to listen to? Uh-huh. Do you really need to know any more? So what if they cant play, neither can I. So Johnny Rotten is annoying. He sounds great here to me, theres no mistaking him for anyone else, thats for sure."
4,This is Nostalgia For Me,"I own this album on vinyl. When I first purchased it, shortly after its release, I thought the Pistols actually had a lot to say. They were angry - and they said it quite loudly. Now, I actually agree that this band was indeed the great rock-n-roll swindle. ""Submission"" actually has a lot to recommend it in terms of production (very raw) and clever lyrics. ""God Save The Queen"" addresses issues that were, at the time the song was composed, fairly serious in England (e.g., the dole). Now, however, I look upon this album with something akin to fond nostalgia. This music no longer represents who I am. Furthermore, after seeing John Lydon perform with Public Image Ltd. (and in a truly ridiculous appearance before Judge Judy), I don't think it represents him either. We've all gotten past it, really. But it still warrants a listen now and then."
1,"Nevermind The Hype, Here's The Truth","The Sex Pistols were a subpar punk/pop band. End of Story. Unfortuantly the media has hyped this album claiming it is ""The Essential Punk Album"", and the sex pistols fooled everyone by thinking that they were a rebelieous band. If you want some good Punk/Rock music, buy ""London Calling"", that's a real punk masterpiece."
1,It really was a rock n' roll swindle...,"All those people out there that believe that Johnny Rotten and the Sex Pistols were ""true"" punk rock have just been duped. Sure the songs are catchy and a talked a big game, but did you know that the band didn't write them? Did you know that the album was recorded by studio musicians? Did you ever sit and think what it really means to be an assembled band? You'll find all of that to be true after doing a bit of research. I mean come on, what kind of real band has a bass player that LITERALLY COULD NOT PLAY! Sid Vicious was hand picked out of the local punk rock scene to fit the bands image. There whole existence is a sick joke, and they deserve no more artistic credit than the Backstreet Boys."
1,"May have set a trend, but now it's just a weak album.","OK, it got people to challenge the ""established"" musicians at the time. Good; but like all revolutions did it replace the establishment with a better alternative. Perhaps; a lot of very talented groups and individuals sprung out of what the Sex Pistols did. But a good album? I don't think so. Characterised by very simple guitar chords and a singer with no vocal range but an ability to howl into a microphone in an aggressive manner, the Sex Pistols represented an anti progressive movement. And they did pretty kill off this movement, for better or worse. But whilst, say, Yes, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, etc., were the antichrists as far as the sex pistols went, musical ability was replaced by no musical ability. I listened to this album as little as five years after it came out. It sounded just as it was meant to; a bunch of talentless musicians with a raw sound."
3,"Fine, but nothing good enough to be hailed as much as it is","This album is fine, but nothing great. Whomever commented PIL is worse than the Pistols have not heard PIL. How can you hate PIL and find the Pistols listenable? Public Image Ltd were very accessable, unlike the harsh punk rock of the Sex Pistols. Heck, your mom might even like the band if she loves 80's pop music. I say Bollocks is an adequete listen, but Lydon needs a much more skillfull backup band and set of musical arrangements to make his songs great. Buy this album if you love punk. If you don't like punk then buy a Public Image Limited CD (""Happy"" is best to start with).Cheers!"
3,It's the Pistols...what can ya say?,"Now before you behead me, let me state that the sex pistols are a great punk band, but alas, not the best. So many individuals seem to think that they are the ones that invented ""punk rock"" although this is not true at all. While this may be a great album, I don't know if I'd really recommend it unless you are a die-hard Pistol's fan. I got bored with it easily, and would much rather pop in a Misfit CD or a Ramones CD than this. In fact I haven't even listened to it for at least a year now! I even almost sold it for a few extra bucks, but I couldn't part with it, cuz once in a while I do like to reminisce. The decision is all yours my friends, dig em' or not. Take it or leave it..."
5,"sex pistols=smart, quality music",they were smart and they wanted to tell everyone their views. they did and made good music out of it
5,Classic Rock.,"I used to call this the best Aerosmith album they never made, but Mr. Tyler doesn't have a British accent. That being said I view this more as a hard rock album than a punk album.Musically it's pretty good. Thankfully, any playing Sid Vicious did for this album was left off or buried deep in the mix. Most of the bass is by Glen Matlock who was a key songwriter too.Glen, however, was not 'punk' enough for the stage and fired. He did return after being fired to do some polishing in the studio (according to John's bio).I never find this album boring. It's always one I can turn to for some good rebelious guitar rock. Pretty Vacant, indeed."
4,Must have,"Although musically this is by no means the exhibition of great talent, it has to be given credit for the impact it has made on the world. Although ""punk rock"" is a commonly thrown around, and often misused reference, this album is one of the conerstones of the punk scene. A music collection is not complete without it."
1,"Best album, worst mastering","First of all, I think this is one of best music made ever. However do not purchase this ""deluxe"" version, the mastering is so bad. No bass, flat out brickwalled production. Buy old version, or if possible, get the original lp version. Shame on for the producers and mr. Mastering guru."
5,omg people are dumb,"Who are these idiots who say they were posers? The were no other bands like them at the time! STOP MAKING UP RANDOM CRAP ABOUT BANDS YOU DON'T HAVE A CLUE ABOUT!!! How were these guys posers? These guys weren't a marketing scam either. Why would a record company choose to make a punk band to use a scam for money. Punk bands were frowned upon in the 70s. If the record company wanted to make money they would have made a Pink Floyd or Zeppelin rip-off, not a punk band. This isn't forced anger either, they were banned in some parts of of England. They weren't there to make money. They were there to play music. Although people may say their music was simple, all punk is! Most punk songs are made up of simple 3 chords riffs. Not just sex pistol songs.Like it or not, the sex pistols were one of the most influencial punk bands of all time along with the clash and some others."
5,Hahahahaha . . . to be read with a snarl,"Everything else (money, talent, McLaran, Spungen, etc., etc.)aside, this album is hillarious. The Sex Pistols were, and are, mass market art at its most glorious apex of self-parody. The fact the Pistols can't play, their lyrics are infantile, and they're just plain ugly is the point. We, consumers, love it. Hell, I've bought the CD at least four times: it always seems to be stolen. I'll buy it again. And Johnny Rotten et al can laugh themselves right to the bank."
5,I finally know what real Punk Rock is..,"About 6 years ago I was heavily into Green Day, Blink182 and Good Charlotte.I never even heard the Sex Pistols before. 2 years ago I bought this CD. Ever since then, my whole perspective changed on Music and Punk itself. This spawned into me checking out all the old Punk bands like The Clash, The Dammed, The Ramones etc. Since then I haven't even bothered to listen to GreenDay, Good Charlotte or Blink182. I realized they were just a bunch of talentless punk wannabes who were just in it for the money and had nothing important or intelligent to say. I'm so glad I bought this album. This is true Punk music."
5,ThE PiStOlS ArE tHe OrIgInAls...,"I'm sorry, but if you tote the name punk you have to love the pistols. the journalist caroline coon dubbed them so. Never mind the Bollocks is great...if someone says buy crap like the Clash or Ramones, demand the real thing. music is skill+emotion, so thier lack of skill is greatly improvised. ""bodies"" is my personal fav, its a spiteful non-religious pro-life song. The pistols loved to insult both leftists and right-wing pigs. What a great band...what a memoriable album...."
4,I'm not a punk fan but this album is awesome,"The Sex Pistols are the greatest punk band ever, well if you dont count Nirvana as a punk band. They were one of the only mainstream one back in the late seventies as well along with the Ramones and The Clash. I love songs like ""Bodies"" and ""Problems"" mainly because those songs are like so rebelious and its like you vs. The Sex Pistols type thing. This band rules and if you're a punkrock fan you should already have this (if you don't you're a poseur) and if you're not a punk fan (like me) get it anyway, this album rules and this is real punk, not the crap record labels pass off as punk these days."
5,"Buy this is you want a ""remastered version"" of this album...","if you want an upgraded/punchier/clearer/louder sound, you cant go wrong here. it is the best sounding version of this album to date. i also have the new uk boxset and this sounds identical to disk one of the boxset (both are mastered from the analog master to my knowledge!?)."
2,no talent,"Their music was not good.Just goffy and silly.This cd is ver forgetable and does not need to be ever listened to again.I cant recomend this silly,put-on music.The sex pistols were a fake! and a fraud and you should know that by now."
1,The Sex Pistols REMASTERED? BOLLOCKS!! That's naf...!,"Hmmmm... It just doesn't seem right; The Sex Pistols ""Never Mind The Bollocks"" REMASTERED...I think we should listen to it recorded off of an old scratched vinyl record (found in a used record shop) copied onto a crappy beat-box cassette recorder and then dubbed again onto another beat-up tape found from the bottom of the floorboards of a '76 Plymouth Fury. That would sound better."
2,It's not that great,"The first time I heard the Sex Pistols, I though ""It sounds like Mott the Hoople with no keyboards."" PiL has done alot better music over the years. Johnny remarked it will go great with the Barry Manilow when it was released on CD."
4,"although they only had one album, it was a spectacular one","I bought this cd not knowing how good it would be, but it threw me into the punk scene, its awsome, buy it now."
2,most over rated LP of the decade,"When I was in 6th grade, be that 1980, a teacher said that ""punk"" was dead. I have to agree. The Sex Pistols were not the first, best, or most influencial ""punk"" band. They were simpley the most commercially successful at that time. Big yip. So the main stream conformist media hypes them, more people buy them, and it feeds itself. Anyone with a shred of honesty will tell you that the album is junk by any standards other than the bottom line. It sells. That does not make it good. That just makes the album an unwitting parody of itself."
5,A Forgotten Gem,"This is a great album, released in 1977 and there are some real winners on this CD. ""Home"" my all time favorite Bonnie Raitt; LOVE that song, have from day one. ""About To Make Me Leave Home,"" ""Louise"" and ""Three Time Loser"" are stand-outs in my mind. I love her version of ""Runaway,"" so gutsy and raunchy. I do not like EVERY song, so normally it would get 4 stars but the ones I do like are super standouts, thus the 5 stars!I think this album got lost by her being over-shadowed by Ronstadt who was putting out some great albums at the same time."
3,Sweet Forgiveness,"WE love to listen to Bonnie Raitt's voice. It is sweet and pure. However, there was only one song on this tape that is the style of music we like to listen to. That is why I choose only a three star rating."
1,1 star for Remastered - 5 stars for original,"Who remastered it? It sure wasn't Bob; find the UNremastered CD if you can. Or better yet, - the original LP is absolutely amazing. This remastered version is a record company trying to tell you it is ""New and Improved"" when it is neither.For the best experience in appreciating Bob Marley and what he accomplished, read a biography, then listen to all the ORIGINAL albums. Here are some of my favorite Bob Marley songs that are NOT usually on any best list:Heathen, Small Axe, Who the Cap Fit, War, Get Up Stand Up, Johnny Was, Duppy Conqueror, Cry To Me, One Foundation.If I was forced to pick his best song it would probably be ""War."" Even though he didn't write the words and it is largely spoken, it is extremely powerful."
2,Underwhelming Prince,"Disappointing soundtrack to an ill-conceived Prince movie - as though the world needed a sequel to ""Purple Rain."" Even guest artists such as George Clinton, Mavis Staples and The Time cannot save ""Graffiti Bridge"" (1990) from utter derivativeness. Only ""Thieves in the Temple,"" ""The Question of U"" and Tevin Campbell's ""Round and Round"" are worthy of your time. A definite low point in the Prince discography."
5,Way underrated Prince,"This cd is worth the price just to hear Mavis Staples belt ""Melody Cool"" but the other songs are such fresh beats in the inimitable way that Prince turns it out. It's still good 16 years later."
3,"not his best, but tolerable","Graffiti Bridge is not Prince's strongest work but features some cuts worth a listen. ""The question of U"" is probably the sexiest track here. The collaboration with George Clinton, ""We Can Funk"", is also worth a listen."
4,A little biased?,"When this CD came out I was in love with Prince...no one could touch him. I thought this was going to go down in history. I even went to see the movie twice (singing along with every song)and watched it nearly everyday when we got it on tape. Ok, when I was 8 I was a little delusional. However, I look back at this CD and considering the time it was released, it was still decent. The guest spots can be skipped as well as the title track but as always he leaves us with a few signature songs. ""The Question of You"", ""Joy in Repetition"" and ""Thieves in the Temple"" are the best. If you were willing to venture into the world of singles, perhaps you heard the original ""Get Off"" and ""Loveleft, Loveright"" on the maxi for ""New Power Generation""-- fine reminders that the man didn't lose his touch."
3,It Grows Slow,"I thought this album was really bad when I first picked it up. I no longer dislike it, but there aren't enough killer tracks on it to make it a staple in my CD player. Check out ""Question of U"" (possibly his best religious song), ""New Power Generation"", ""Thieves in the Temple"" and ""Round and Round"". All in all, decent, but get this one after you get most of his other work."
4,A good return after Batman !,"This album is very widely ranged in styles, like Around the world in a day was before. It has funk ( New Power Generation, We Can Funk, The Latest Fashion ), blues-kind ( The Question Of U, Joy In Repetition ), ballad ( Still Would Stand All Time ), rock&roll ( I Can't Stop This Feeling I got ) and the title track, which is something different from the others, very happy and sad song at once. Well, it's a great album, the only reason I don't give it a 5 is that Prince/O(+> has more powerful ones ( eg. Chaos And Disorder or Emancipation ) !"
4,contains one of princes all time best songs!,my fave song on the album is definately (the new power genaration!) it is very underated. i also like the ? of u and joy in repetition and theives in the temple!
1,"Paint over this ""Graffiti""","The title track sounds like a theme to a sitcom, and the rest isn't much better. Not even cameos from George Clinton, The Time, and Mavis Staples can compensate for the lack of a single decent melody. It's pointless to discuss individual tracks because they mostly sound the same. If you want a musical token from this movie, I highly recommend ""Pandemonium"" by The Time. There's more fun in its first 5 minutes than in the entire ""Graffiti Bridge"" album."
1,weak,aside from joy in repetition this is very forgettable.it's back on the block light.one is enough.
3,Not one of my favorites..,"This is my least favorite Prince album. Although it is not a total dud with tracks like Joy In Repetition, Question of U, Theives In The Temple, and the New Power Generation.B."
2,Find Another,"I kept reading because I thought it had to get better. It didn't. Contrived dialogue, character development that evaporates, and a non-ending all contribute to an average story and a poor mystery."
2,Full of one-note stereotypes,"I found nothing suspenseful or entertaining about this book. It was a by-the-numbers novel full of insulting depictions of so-called overbearing ""Jewish"" mothers and cold as ice ""Waspy"" parents. This is the first and last book I plan to read by this author."
3,"ENJOYABLE, BUT NOT THE BEST","Jess and Charlie Magill have the perfect life, 3 talented children, successful careers, and a happy marriage.When the police show up at their house to arrest their teenage son of a shocking crime, everything falls apart.As Jess tries to uncover the truth about the crime, she realizes she may not know her family at all.""After The Fall"" examines the secrets hidden in families, and the impact they can have when forced to confront them.The novel starts off very exciting and starts to lose steam about halfway through. It is a good book, but some plot twists go unanswered. The climax is satisfying, not the best, but statisfying.Judith Kelman is a good writer of suspense fiction, this novel is not one of her best. It is a readable novel, with some page-turning plot twists, but it does not know if it wants to be a character study of the family members or a suspense novel.Nick Gonnella"
2,Don't waste your time,"AS had been written before, the book kind of sucked me in at first but turned into a total dud. The end was a big disappointment. There was lack of plot development, lack of character development, and most of it was just unbelievable."
2,Sometimes less is more,"I was grabbed by the premise of the book but quickly found myself irritated with Kelman's writing. She unnecessarily develops characters who make only passing appearances with graphic detail; her characters are bizarrely extreme and not-so-believable; and she uses excessive turns of phrases and heavy vocabulary as if she were showing off her handle on the English language. Kelman lacks subtelty where a lot would go a long way. It took me almost four months to finish this book (reading several others in between), and I wish I would have just let it go, but I kept hoping that this book would redeem itself. It would take a lot for me to take a chance on another Kelman book."
2,Deja Vu!,"I am halfway through reading this book and am stunned at the similarities between it and Rosellen Brown's ""Before and After"", which was made into a movie starring Meryl Streep, Liam Neeson, and Edward Furlong. In Brown's book, a New England couple are stunned when their teenage son is suspected of murdering a neighborhood girl. The mother is a doctor; the father is more of a house husband, and they have a preadolescent daughter, too....the same cast of characters as in ""After the Fall""! The simliarities don't end there....as the couple struggle to cope with the accusations, they are faced with neighborhood gossip, harassing phone calls and a lot of unanswered questions from their uncooperative son. I feel as though I am reading the SAME EXACT book for the second time!"
1,too trite,"I kept waiting for this book to get better. It's not hard to put it down, but very difficult to pick back up. Her characters are all out of an overblown soap opera. You can guess exactly what's going to happen with the first few chapters. Absolutely no surprises here! Don't bother!"
1,Don't Waste Your Money or Time,"This book was ridiculous. A scary mentally-ill patient threatens to destroy her psychologist's comfortable life, and sure enough it starts unraveling. However, the patient has nothing to do with it, there's no resolution of various subplots, and all in all it was a disappointing read. I wouldn't buy another book by this author."
1,Disappointed,"""After the Fall"" did not live up to the write-ups listed on the book. There was a lot of promise in the story line and the first few pages grabbed your interest of things to come, but the book fell flat. The author started to develop some of the characters and then just stopped. The prologue seemed to be written by someone other than the person who wrote the story. I finished the book on a recent flight and just left it in the seat pocket. I would not purchase another book by this author and I am even disappointed in the publisher!"
2,Disappointing!,"I checked this book out of the library and after I had finished I checked the book spine. Lo and behold it was NOT catalogued as a mystery, only fiction. That'll teach me. By the end of page 9 I was expecting a real thriller with a completely different plot twist, but it never happened! The end of ""After the Fall"" was a total letdown. It was as if Kelman got tired of writing. A pity. It could have been so much better."
3,The book started out a five but fizzled to a 2-3 by the end!,"I picked this book up at the library, and have to admit, at first I was intrigued by the synopsis of the book. The book was made out to be something that it was not. I expected something fantastic to happen mid-book, but it just fizzled out! I read this book in 2 days, and I will say it really pulls you in at the beginning, but I guess I was looking for Danny's (the son, and problem child) story to be more compelling. The mystery was lagging, but the writing was very good. I would give this book 3 stars. I would even reccomend it, I just wouldn't pay full hardback prices for it."
2,I liked it but...,"Started off with lots of steam, but somehow lost it. The ending was disturbing - what happens to Lisa? Also, what if it wasn't for grandpa's tens of thousands of dollars needed to get him off? Also - the mental image of the sister sitting on her brother's lap with him kissing her and seeing him with a huge erection sticking out of his underwear - this is passed off as 'normal' by the mom?! I don't think so - confirms my views of mental health providers - more nuts than the patients, sometimes."
1,The book starts out so well... but the ending was terrible!,"The book had tons of suspense and I couldn't wait to finish it, but I was terribly disappointed with the ending! It seemed like the author decided the book was long enough and finished writing in about 20 pages. I do not recommend reading After the Fall; it was a waste of my time."
1,What a Dud!,"I turned the book over and over searching for the final chapter. Did the author just get tired and quit? Where's the ending? Author Judith Kelman leaves at least one major clue unresolved (Ryan's whispered cryptic statement), and frustratingly provides no resolution to some of the book's major plot twists. It's a cruel blow to the reader to simply abandon Lisa to her father without attempting some closure and justice. I forced myself through the amateurish prose and the predictable plot hoping for some sense of unity toward the end, only to throw the book down in disgust. Someone take this woman's laptop away from her before she writes another book!"
3,Baryshnikov,"The three star rating is only for Baryshnikov. There is no choreographer in the world that could make Baryshnikov look bad.That said, I didn't like this version of Carmen. Carmen? What's with the chairs? Petit makes Barysnikov's part look more like Escamillo's than Don Jose's.And I did not like Zizi Jeanmaire at all. For one thing she looks older than ""Don Jose"" and overly eager, rather than disdainfully seductive. But I don't think that's the main problem. I just hate the choreography.If it wasn't for the pleasure that I get from looking at Baryshnikove dance (or just stand there and give you the entire story with the look on his face and his body language) I would have rated this dvd one star, maybe two if I was feeling generous."
2,"Sadly, I hardly ever watch it.","For Baryshnikov fans, this particular ballet does not showcase Misha's virtuostic gifts. Roland Petit's choreography is over-the-top throughout the ballet. In some of the dance sequences, the corps de ballet speaks (in French, of course). This makes a serious story come off silly which was probably not Petit's intent. For such a natural dancer as Baryshnikov, he looks somewhat uncomfortable in the choreography although the role of Don Jose fits him quite well. Zizi Jeanmarie does not make a convincing Carmen at her age and the chemistry between Baryshnikov and Jeanmarie is lacking. For Baryshnikov fans, ""Don Quixote"" or ""Baryshnikov Dances Sinatra"" will more likely please you."
2,Carmen Fails,"Any resemblance between this production and Bizet's opera is purely accidental and not intentional. Baryshnikov, as always, is fantastic but Zizi Jeanmarie is a smiling flirty chick who just can't carry off the character. In addition, the story is not conveyed as essential elements of the story are conspicuously absent to anyone who has seen the opera. All in all, I which I had never spent my money on it."
2,Of little interest...,"While any ballet featuring Mikhail might be reason enough to watch it, this work might be the exception. Very little of the choreography is appealing and the sets are very bland. This is the drabest Spain I've seen pictured in a good while. Mikhail acquits himself nicely, but sadly Zizi does not. While perhaps an expressive and talented dancer in her heyday, here she appears to be afraid of injury and never really stretches herself. You can see the concentration on her face as she prepares for simple back attitudes. She has an adequate port-de-bras, but her shoulders, so pivotal to Spanish dance, barely twitch when they should shimmy. Carmen was a vivacious gypsy, but Zizi gives us a merely brittle, hesitant gamine with a toothy smile. She is acting like hell, but it is not enough to cover her flaws."
3,A few fave songs for a song,"I got this CD for the tracks ""Outbound Plane"" and ""A Mind of Her Own,"" and also enjoyed ""Hiding a Fire in the Dark."" I don't care for most of the other songs -- they're not bad, it's just a matter of my own personal taste and style preference. I paid a song for this CD, and the tracks I mentioned are worth the price. If you like a few of the tracks and don't have them yet, I suggest getting the CD, since it's worth it. Who knows, you might discover that you like the rest of the tracks as well."
4,"A cinematic, powerful and passionate view of ocean science.","People have always been drawn to the sea, and Robert Kunzig's amazing book lets us all in on some of the reasons: the sea is alive with secrets and energy and strange creatures, just waiting to be discovered. Kunzig chronicles the many attempts to peer beneath the waves and reveal these secrets, and shows the overwhelming impact the ocean has had on our planet's history and is still having today. Crisply written and compellingly laid out, his story is one that shows us, rather than simply telling us, the power that the oceans have over our planet."
5,Brings out the oceanographer in all of us,"I loved this book. Mr. Kunzig took quite a lot of technical information and made it accessible to the average ocean lover. It made me look much closer when I go out cod fishing, especially at the odd jellies that I never noticed before floating around the boat. I would recommend this book for anyone interested in the seas."
3,"Good, but isn't for everyone","Finely written, but the book is not for the casual reader. Descriptions are very detailed and heavy in scientific jargon. Great book for someone with a good background on the subject but a bit too encyclopedic for the average reader (like me)."
1,NOT for Garden Hose,"The tube which is inserted into the end of the hose fit so loosely in my 3/4"" Gilmour hose that no amount of crimping would make a leak free seal. Admittedly, the package does say ""HOT WATER"", BUT, the back of the package states ""FOR OUTDOOR AND COLD WATER USE ONLY""."
2,No suggestions for traditional-looking interiors,"This is great if you're not worried about reselling your home or if you're in a market that supports a lot of the kind of things they show in this book, but it's short on practical suggestions for folks who want to incorporate healthy ideas into a regular-looking house."
2,Not great,"The hardware on this heater immediately rusted. The panel over the propane tank does not fit correctly, so that the cover can not be secured in place. The diffusion hood over the heating element is relatively small so that the heat is contained in a small area around the heater."
1,Endless Summer Patio Heater - Don't Buy it,"A couple of calls to customer service, many skinned knuckles and at least 8 hours of labor - and I still can't get this patio heater together (hence the name ""endless summer?""). The hang up is ""step 9"" - attaching the gas line and regulator assembly. They simply don't attach. I've called the company and spoken to two people. They know this is a problem and kindly expressed their confidence in my ability to ""get it done."" I'm not a total incompetent and I'm a pretty strong guy. I've gone at this assembly in five different ways, lubed the fittings, etc. In my defense, my race car mechanic neighbor and a mechanical engineer friend also failed to mate these fittings. The replacement part I was sent also doesn't fit. At this point, I've got far more labor and frustration in this patio heater than it is worth - and, insult to injury, I'll likely have to pay to drop it off at the landfill."
2,expected better product,"I was very disappionted in this product.when i got it all the sockets where mixed up ,do to case was defective in the molding part cant hold sockets in place.the first socket i used split ,taking off a distributor cap on a gm vehicle.I have a set of gearwrench rachet type wrenches been very satified with them, so thought id try these sockets.they do have life time so i will be taking it to nearest place to replace it."
1,Terrible Midget Guitar,"Do not buy this midget guitar it is much smaller than the guitar that came with my game. I was fooled by the reviews don't let them fool you. Oh yeah and get this it is not compatiable with my other guitar, which is the reason I bought it in the first place. It does not work with for multiplayer. Pay the extra $25 and get a better guitar."
1,Stay away from this,"What a disappointment. First, although it comes in a box the same size as a regular GH2 guitar, this controller is about 2/3 the size. I found this very uncomfortable and, well, if you thought the regular GH controller looked silly, this was downright ridiculous. The whole thing looks and feels cheap and when I got it out of the box, there was the sound of something rattling around inside.After plugging it in (and waiting about 60 seconds for it to connect) I immediately felt how stiff everything is. To use star power you need to tilt the controller completely vertical and hold it there. And just to make it complete, the whammy bar was broken.I returned this product immediately."
1,is this who you want to buy from,"Hello, we have sold thousands of these and not one other customer has thought this other than you! this comes from the email that they sent me after asking what i that had thought i was going to happen. then they go on to say they do not have to do with any of the posting amazon is the one that dose it. wow wow that is what i want from some the i'm buying from. not try to fix it but pass it on to someone. they go on to me the know one think that. that there would be no way to think that you can get some thing for the price in did. I have gone to buy alot of things for amazon before and i have gotten the wolds best deal before the wording of the posting was realley bad. nut they sad they will not fix the wording for other buyers but in the end i have got bad help but this takes it allthe are realley bad and will not help you at all hope the this will hlep some one not to buy for someone that will not help you.thank for read my mad writngfromsome guy that care"
3,Best of Blues #1,"This set of blues tunes is ok but not special. I'll keep looking for a more definitive, must-have set of songs."
2,TOTALLY SOLD OUT!!!!!,"i heard the song ""promiscuous"" and sure i liked it but she totally sold out. i mean the rest of her cds were good and maybe they werent doing as good as they could have but that doesnt mean she needed to find a whole new style. stick with the old that way she could at least have respect from her fans. i don't have ANY respect from her. shes just like everyone else out there. at least before she was unique and thats what made me like her. i deffinitly WILL NOT buy this cd. its not worth the money."
1,Is change good,I was always an nelly furtado fan but now that she went and changed her stlye just to become famous i think is perposterous!! well she made her chocie and now i will not be her fan no more i used to look up at her music and think she was great but now i don't have her anymore so good bye nelly furtado and hello Evanescence's New Cd The Open Door in stores 10-3-06
1,Here Is The Truth,"What about my ching ching chingNelly can't sing sing singI want my money back I wasted todayWhat about your ching ching ching""Loosed"" shouldn't cost a thing thing thingTell Nelly she has to pay you back your money todayHollllaaaaaa!"
2,"Basic, not at all complete","Emphasis is on the military chronology, not the political or social history of the event that ""created"" the twentieth century. Starting with William Manchester's weak introduction, Burg and Purcell provide an almost daily account of events on the Western Front, with much less attention paid to other theaters. The chronology is filled with pictures -- many rarely printed and of some interest -- and generally useless sidebars that only barely scratch the surface of their topics. The maps are old, and completely inadequate for their purpose. The biographies are somewhat useful, but are only a glimmering of the promise that the book could have held. A basic reference work, little more."
3,predictable,"I found this book to be based on common sense. It was well meaning, but frankly rather predictable. For general knowledge it was good, but if you have read a lot about the subject already, you might be disappointed."
5,"Reclaiming Desire, Fantasy and Spicy Lovemaking for Seniors!","I'm glad this book showed up on an Amazon.com search for ""seniors in love.""I found and ordered SEASONED ROMANCE, THE LOST LOVE CHRONICLES, THE RETURN OF DESIRE and this gem, RECLAIMING DESIRE.Each one, in its own unique way, pointed me back to the fact that it is never too late to find both true love and wonderful sex, including for seniors.The subtitle of this book, FOUR KEYS TO FINDING YOUR LOST LIBIDO, says it best! And I can tell you from experience that it is true. The libido wasn't lost; it was just in need of being reclaimed.Thank goodness for writers like the Powells, Dr. Nancy Kalish, Gina Oden, and RECLAIMING DESIRE's wonderful Drs. Andrew Goldstein and Marianne Brandon, for each extraordinary author has pointed the way toward filling life with romance (and hopefully lots of years of spicy, seasoned senior sex)!(Plus the fantasy-causing front cover of this book is worth the price of the book, right?)"
4,Just started reading and has already helped!,"I have only made it through the first few chapters, but this book has already helped. I'm a recenlty married 26 year old, but because I have Hashimoto's Disease (low thyroid) I was stuggling with a low libido. My husband was trying to be very understanding, but it was difficult being that we have only been married a little over a year. This book helped me stop feeling so stressed out, and reminded me I needed to take time for myself. Once I started paying attention to myself and my own needs, I found my problems with low libido start to dissapear. I recommend this book for anyone stuggling with low libido. You aren't alone, and this book offers much needed support to help you get your libido back where it should be."
4,Very Helpful,"This book was very helpful to me, especially the emotional section. I would suggest it to anyone that has had sexual trauma in the past and is still trying to cope with trusting another."
5,A Study In The Book Of Acts,I have read many books on the Book of Acts. This Book is to the point. It is written for the common layman. The books written dealing with each chapter showning the transition from the Law to the age of Grace. The book will show the reader the God's dealings with the human race dispensationaly. Israel's rejections of Jesus Christ to the Gentile nations through the ministry of the apostle Paul. Book a must for all christian libraries.
4,Red Hat Club Audio,"Great audio book. I love this author, Hayward Smith. I like listening to the story being told with the Southern accent! It gives it a more ""authentic"" feel."
5,The Red Hat Club,"What a great book! Once I started the book, I couldn't put it down...finished it in 3 days. The characters were very well developed, and I felt like they were old friends before the end of the book. Haywood Smith is an superb story teller. After reading this novel, I immediately read the sequel and haven't been disappointed by any. The only disappointment is that she doesn't write fast enough!"
5,ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS BOOK!,"There's not much I can say about this book that hasn't already been said. I loved the book. The characters were believable and I enjoyed each one. WHen the book went back to their high school days, it reminded me so much of my own. THe scene in which they couldn't get the car to go forward and drove it back, backwards, was hysterical. I sent the copy of my book to my cousin. I wanted her to enjoy it like I did!"
4,fun summer read,"I read this book after I finished a more serious piece of literature and found it to be fun, and humerous. It's an easy and fast read if you are looking for a good summer book. The characters and plot are not necessarily realistic but who wants realistic!? I enjoyed the book and think most women would get a kick out of it too."
5,True Friendship,The Red Hat Club by Haywood Smith is a 5 star book. I really likedthis book it would be one i would recommend. And what I liked withthis book it blended the past and the present together and Smith didsooo good on doing that in my opinion.Its about a group of ladies thatwear red hats and purple outfits. It has all the feelings its funnybut also heart warming too.
4,good but not great,"While I will be reading the sequel to this book, I found myself putting it down and not wanting to pick it back up for days at a time, which for me is unusual."
3,"Close, but no Cigar","Aside from my inability to identify with any one character, my distaste for the ""glory days"" flashbacks, my confusion with Ms. Smith's reluctance to use 'foul language' like ""cr*p,"" but an overuse of the word ""tw*t,"" the female, narrow-minded perspective of a 'friends first' world where men take a distant third to a lunch with the girls and a good read, it wasn't a total waste. I did appreciate the aspirations of acceptance between women and the central theme that you never really know someone; hidden strengths (and weaknesses) lie within us all. There may be a small crowd that can enjoy this book who hasn't gone through an ugly divorce, wished they could relive the past or can relate to mostly one-dimensional, cardboard cutouts resembling real characters, but I found it a push to prod myself through a good portion of this book."
3,Friendship through the ages,"Although the premise for this story has been done before, Smith sets this book apart from others by the sheer longevity of the character's frienships.Georgia, SuSu, Teeny, Diane, and Linda are closer than sisters and true to each other. When one hurts they all hurt. When one celebrates, they all celebrate.Joining forces and getting background info on Diane's husband to blackmail him and his bank is the main gist of the story. How they do it and how they use the info mean only ballsy Southern women at their best and their bitchiest.Everything wraps up a little too neatly for me after the decades of suffering these women have gone through, but it's a fun, distracting read for a slow summer day."
2,my thoughts,"I thought it would be really cool to be part of a society that wore red hats in public. Being part of a club where one could identify another club member because they are wearing a certain item of clothes while in public, fascinates me. But then I started reading the book. I found the characters non-believable. The rules of the club, do overs and make overs were just too restrictive. Life is not about squashing dialogue with your friends because you are too uncomfortable or too polite to say what is on your mind. The scene about catching Harold in the act truly stretched my imagination. The amounts of money thrown around boggled my mind. And the ending? It reminded me of the last episode of Seventh Heaven."
5,Loved this light hearted book,"I'm not sure what the other reviewers were thinking when they gave this book such low ratings, but I thought this book was hilarious. While I am far from 50 and am just learning about the red hat society, I thought this book was a very light hearted read. The characters were funny in their own way and the story line was a riot. I loved the flashbacks to their sorority days and the meeting with Georgia and her old flame was classic. If you are looking for an easy read and a way to escape from reality for a while, pick this one up. You will not be disappointed."
2,This is NOT your RED HAT SOCIETY!,"This book really has little to do with the Red Hat Society, fortunately. My group of Red Hatters is quite a bit more mature than this group of 50-somethings stuck in their teen years. There is a lot of mediocre revenge from shallow, stuck up ""socialites."" The word(s) Y'ALL is used ad nauseum, sometimes more than once in the same sentence....a waste of time as far as I was concerned..."
2,Don't think too much about this book,"As I read this book, I found it entertaining. However after I finished, I became rather angry at it. The women were always ""scheming"" to get back at their men to obtain financial independence. What ever happened to getting a job! I'm not from the south but I think the whole Southern Belle thing is outdated and pretty boring.When I get to the point of wearing a red hat and purple, I hope I can find more constructive things to do with my time!"
3,A poor substitute for the Sweet Potato Queens,"I was very disappointed in what I thought would be a ""Sweet Potato Queen"" type book. This was a distant wannabe. The writing seemed forced and thus the humor and overall flow were just missing. I agree with the other reviewers re the flat, cardboard cutout characters. Maybe this holds more appeal to someone from Atlanta who can relive their own experiences through it but for a California girl this book totally missed the mark."
1,Avoid at All Cost!!,"What a waste of a reader's time! Friends for umpteen years, these women still rely on ""traditions"" established when they were pre-teens? I don't think so. I cannot possibly imagine any group of middle aged women who will cite certain ""rules"" (referred to as ""traditions"" in their jargon) throughout conversations. Who keeps track of such nonsense? The characters might have had substance, but the constant back tracking to the days of yore (teendom) led to days of yawn by yours truly. And in the end, they all lived happily ever after--if not with a man, then with his fortune. Just ducky. Just avoid it. Trust me."
4,Great Beginner Robot for Programming And Fun,"For those who have a talent for assembly and who want to learn robot programming and motion dynamics, this is an excellent kit. The robot has a simple interface and uses Basic as the programming language. It also has a pose mode where the program can be written by posing the robot and then taking a snap shot to automatically ""write"" the code. It teaches basic programming, servo theory, and human motion dynamics (walking, running, dancing, flipping, balance, etc). I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it has no sensor accessories for feed back available at this time. It will challenge a preteen (my twelve year old assembled and programmed it and its running and back flipping around the house). For those mechanically challenged purchase the preassembled version - the unassembled version has many parts."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!,"this is POOP! I lost all my money when I bought it! it looks weak! when he battled with robosapien V2 he lost! this is a awful robot! I do not recomend it.if you want a cool robot,try Robosapien,Robosapien V2 or RS media."
1,"Worse ROBOT ""EVER""",See my title dont waste your money on this!Maybe $20 this is alot of money for JUNK!
4,"wonderful to look at and great recipes, a lot of work","I loved this show on PBS partly because she made it seem so easy. Her recipes didn't seem as easy in the book, and my family probably wouldn't eat most of them, but I still loved it! (I would certainly eat them, they all contain such interesting and fresh ingredients.) Overall, I really like her and her cookbook, she's such an opptimist (and her cookbook reflects that)."
5,"Great food, beautiful book","I received this book as a gift and have been given it to others as well. The layout is terrific and the quality of the photos are as gorgeous as the scenes in her series on tv. I use this book often, but always have it out just so guests can view it. I highly recommend it!"
5,All menu items we've tried have been great!,"After watching Joanne Weir's cooking show on PBS, we decided to find her cookbook and try the recipes ourselves. We have now cooked five items out of the book and all have been great. They are easy to follow recipes and the food is delicious. This is now becoming the book to give to friends for birthdays and holidays."
2,This is not truly a vegetarian cookbook - beware!,"Real vegetarians look out! The title of this cookbook is very misleading. There are at least 2 recipes that contain chicken in the book and the last time I checked, chicken was not a vegetable or tofu or a type of seafood. Look on pages 185 and 205 for the chicken recipes. I was very disappointed when I saw this. And practically every type of seafood that man eats is in so many of the recipes that real vegetarians will want to stay far away from this book unless they're willing to spend the time it takes to convert every recipe to true vegetarian status."
5,Best of the 30's gangster movies.,"Although there were many movies similar to this one made in the 30's and 40's, I feel that this one stands out for it's realism and spark. The rise and fall of a gangster was never this well done."
4,Scarface,Scarface (1932) (Lo Sfregiato) have yet to see this version universal disc player due to arive soon then i will view this film
3,Decent Movie,"The movie was fair. If this was based on Al Capone, there are other movies based on his reign that are more detailed and better written"
2,B MOVIE POT BOILER,.....Having both Hell's Angeles and The Outlaw in my collection I thought I would add the third of the Howard Hughes trilogy to complete the set ...What I got was just another prohibition gangster movie ........Maybe this movie set the standard for crime noir but the many that followed had superior plots and acting ...Muni was unconvincing as an Italian mobster and George Raft's acting was wooden ...Muni's implied incestuous relationship with his sister did not make sense and added little to the drama ........This is the type of movie I could watch only once which disqualifies it as a collectable ...the Al Pacino version was superior in acting and a much more gruesome version but I wouldn't want to own that one either ...I don't want to own a movie that I am not willing to watch more than once.
5,An Addictive Page-Turner!,"If you are a fan of spy stories & stories about people in 'high society', this is the perfect book for you. I lost many hours of sleep over this one!The book chronicles the author's double life as an undercover OSS agent in Spain who was to ultimately become the wife of a Spanish count.I found it very interesting to read about how she lived & conducted herself as a young American lady who was sent to Spain, at the age of 21, to infiltrate high society. Her purpose being to help thwart various coups & assasinations, yet making sure that she never gave herself away.All of the following words come to mind when reading this book: intrigue; cloak & dagger; gripping; thrilling; glamor; elegance; opulance.This is a book you wouldn't be embarassed to give as a gift or to let a young person read: it's SMUT-FREE. A fantastic read that I especially enjoyed while lying on the beach in Mexico!"
5,Excellent Read!,"This is one of three books written by Aline Griffith Romanos about her adventures as a undercover spy during WW II in Spain. It is excellent! I first read the book 25 years ago, have read them all more than once, recommended all three books to many, and have heard only high praise for the series. They are fun, well written, and real page turners!"
2,Goofed Again,"This CD had no sound samples so I ordered it hoping it was the original recordings.It isnt. The ""Classic Country"" CD has the original recordings but was not avialable so I gambled on this one. So why not just order the other available CD's? THese two have ""BJ the DJ' on them and the others don't. Stonewall's later recordings of his hits don't sound that bad but ""BJ the DJ"" doesn't sound like the 1959 version. THis was my second go round as I ordered a cassette version of ""20 Greatest Hits"" last year and it was worse than this. So, if you want to hear Stonewall sing a wide selection of songs from his career at a modest price then this CD would do if you aren't looking for the original recordings."
5,timeless masterpiece,"Sir Thomas Carlyle has woven deep meaning into each phrase and footnote of SARTOR RESARTUS. The Philosophy of Clothes remains a living garmet for the laystall of our day. This manuscript bears wisdom for generations that read the struggles of Diogenes Teufelsdrockh or the indulgences of Philip Zaehdarm. It has been described as everything from a brilliant metaphorical adaptation of German idealism, to Calvinism, to a thinly disguised autobiography of the Professor himself. The Tailor Re-tailored deals with a conception of the world described by the Psalmist ""As a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed."" Philosophy that trancends time."
4,WARNING! THE INSTRUMENTAL VERSION ARE NOT INCLUDED!,"HELLO. THIS GERMAN CD SINGLE ""EVERYBODY"" (FIRST MADONNA'S SINGLE) CONTAINS THE FOLLOWING TRACKS : 1. EVERYBODY (INSTRUMENTAL*) AND DUB VERSION, BUT, THE ""INSTRUMENTAL"" VERSION DOESN'T ARE INCLUDED IN THIS CD, BECAUSE THIS IS A IMPORTANT ""MIS-PRINT"" THAT THE RECORDS COMPANY HAVEN'T FIXED IN EIGHTEEN YEARS ! CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?. SO, KEEP IN MIND: THE ""INSTRUMENTAL"" VERSION IS THE SAME ALBUM VERSION, OK?"
3,Listen to the CD before you buy,"One should listen to this CD before considering a purchase. Historical perspectives are interesting for intellectuals and historians, but it doesn't make the music any more than it is. As a world music fan of 30 odd years I would say this one is 'lame', so buyer beware."
2,basic not advanced,"It's good for someone who is just getting into the field, or someone interested. Otherwise this is as basic as can be and by no means advanced. It gives a general overview of all vehicle system components. Tells you what sensors are used, what type they are, how to read scopes, scanners and multimeters. It has some good drawings of what waveforms should look like on scopes. Also tells you what knocks, rattles and all kinds of other noices can be in each part of a cars system. Shows you what the inputs are to the computer and what the outputs are. Goes into basic allignment also. Probably more related for year 2000 and older cars. This book not useful for anyone who has been in the field for more than 6 months."
1,Worst one I ever owned,"This is without a doubt the worst fish/depth finder I have ever owned. The depth gage changes so slow, you can go from 100' to 1' and be agroundand it will still be at 100'. If you fish in three feet of water for ten minutes and than move out to four feet, you actually have to shut the unit off and turn it back on for it to change depths. I'm sure I've had it to long to return (two months) but I can't wait to replace it. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY SOMETHING ELSE."
4,Good value,"Good no-frills, middle of the line fishfinder. Good all around value for the price point."
3,works well.,"Its my first ""Fish Finder"" experience, had it on the boat for a couple years now, seems to work well. Back lit screen does great in full daylight. i like it. mounted it on my old 1970's boat, works fine."
2,I guess you get what you pay for,"It does work however it is not stable when voltage drops below 12 volts. My Hummingbird still operates properly when the Garmin had given up the ghost. It also does very poorly in heavy weeds and cannot manage any cavitation at speed where it renders massive quantities of noise artifact. Also, it is very slow to restore a usable screen image when mounted on the bow trolling motor and put back in the water at a new fishing spot. It is not useless but I think that I selected a subpar performer for a demanding job. If you planned to use this for saltwater fishing it might be completely adequate however it will not show a thermocline or even consistent bottom composition rendering. I suspect that the fish ID is useless as well so that might be better off disabled. Despite a clear display even in bright sunlight, this is a not much of a performer."
4,Nice set of wrenches,"I putter and do a little DIY around the house and on the cars and I am completely satisfied with the quality of these wrenches. These wrenches are bargain priced and, although I was a little sceptical, they have exceeded my expectations. For years I have been making do with crescent wrenches so it is very nice use wrenches that actually fit!The storage rack is very handy, making wrench management easy. The only downside is the carry handle for the rack is flimsy. In fact, the handle was broken during shipping and was unusable. I did not think it was worth the trouble of returning it, as the rack is still usable."
5,Great AT book,"I have read several AT books and this one has been the most enjoyable so far. I laughed out loud several times. I also really felt a wide range of emotions for their trials (rain, rain,rain). If you enjoy AT stories, don't miss this one."
3,Mic sure is a grouch!,"Annoys the heck outta me. Where are the pictures? I want pictures.This AT hiking book is very different from the other (26, I counted'em) AT hiking narratives I've read. There's no use of trail names, because these three people took it slow and easy, there wasn't the obsession with food, they didn't make any friends, they had no interest in the towns and trail life along the route, they squabbled constantly, and I got tired of the never-ending lectures or mention of the common flora on the trail.I had to wonder why Mic needed to get to Maine by sundown, although Jerri's lack of interest in getting anywhere was just as annoying. I had to laugh though, when at the back of the book was a snapshot of Mic that portrayed him precisely as I pictured him, disgruntled and sour.Going by the other AT narratives I've read, I'd say Mic and Jerri missed the best parts of what the AT's all about. In short, I could have done without the Lowther's and their boring book."
2,This conditioner was okay. It was comparable to ...,"This conditioner was okay. It was comparable to the other brands that I use (Clairol, Finesse, Pantene, etc.) There was nothing to special about it and the smell was kind of funny. I wouldn't recommend this product."
3,A bit small for my 45 gal,nice and compact but i will eventually have to get a bigger one. bio balls should be replaced with live rock.
4,Ballerina Puppet,My daughter received this as a Birthday gift and she absolutely loves it. I would highly recommend these puppets. They are great quality for the price.
4,Adorable to look at,"The puppet is absolutely adorable, just find the costume a bit difficult to get hand in and work properly. However the looks is great and grand daughter loves it."
5,Favorite Toy,"I don't write a lot of reviews, but with this puppet, I feel moved to do so. It is my 4 year old daughter's favorite toy. She has named the puppet, ""Asha"" and she spends at least an hour of every day with this puppet on her arm. (We have had the puppet for almost a year.) My daughter has created an elaborate story about what Asha likes to eat, how she likes to play, and so on.....It is a beloved toy. I know that my ""baby"" won't always be 4. This puppet will be a tender reminder of the games she played."
5,Ballerina is limping..,"Puppets are awesome, I have twelve of them! Arrived on time, packaging could have been better. I run a children's theatre and order these puppets regularly, usually from a different supplier, and they are always packaged in strong boxes with chips or air bags. This was a thin box with no insulation. The box and puppet were crushed, but I needed it right away so I made the best of it."
2,Poor Sound Quality,The songs are great but the cd sounds as if it was recorded from an isolated distance. The sound quality is very poor.
3,Not full versions of songs,"I have been looking for Al Green singing ""How Great Thou Art"" for many years. I had a cassette tape when I was a teenager and I just loved it, so I was so excited to find this on CD. Unfortunately, it is only 2 verses of the song :-(But what is there is beautiful!!"
4,veers towards dryness,"Good perspective on modern music but the writing can veer towards dryness.For example,there's a huge chunk devoted to Milton Babbitt which seems appropriate enough but you get only the most threadbare sense of why one should actually bother to listen to it!A fine book but worth supplementing with more colourful commentators."
4,Good book,"Book provides very thorough info on music post-1945 to music of the last decade (2000). Especially music of the ""avant-garde"" generation. Sometimes, the reading is a bit dense, making it hard to follow. Definitely not light reading, but informative and detailed, nonetheless."
3,Poison Perfume,"I was not satisfied with the company's performance with this order. The order was to be shipped for holiday delivery, not only did it miss the holiday but went way past the reasonable time. The item was a holiday gift and the recipient was very unhappy that it never arrived for Christmas. Never did the site say that it would not make holiday delivery, had it I would not have ordered from them."
5,Good,Tush is a rocker most people that have listen to ZZ Top over the years would remember but this record has good Texas style blues on it also
4,Smokin',"Great album. Some of the live stuff is less than stellar recording-wise, but overall, the sound is much improved. Although the MTV era ZZ was good, the pre-MTV ZZ rocked HARD. Texas blues and a large dose of AC/DC."
4,ROCK 'N ROLL,The re-mastered sound is great on this little Kindle HD Fire8.9. Then again I luv ZZTOPBut on this sound system its great.
3,could have been much better,"I give 5 stars for the remix sound quality, but only 1 star for the extra tracks. I personally would have liked the rest (or, more of) of the live show that the original live tracks came from."
3,5 stars For The Music...1 Star For Only 30 Minutes Of It....,"Hey....How about releasing the entire live show ""side one"" of this album was recorded from. On the original lp, side one was some of the best, kick-*ss rock ever recorded. ""Backdoor Love Affair"" flat out roasted Kiss, Frampton, & Aerosmith all put together. Give us the rest, please!"
3,"Part Live, Part Studio","1975's Fandango! was the follow-up to the band's breakout hit album Tres Hombres. It is something of a mixed bag as it combines live cuts with studio songs. The mix doesn't help the album flow. The studio cuts are first rate including the propulsive hit single ""Tush"" (which topped out at number twenty), the solid ""Hear It On The X"" and one the band's best and most underrated songs ""Balinese"". The live songs are good and show off the band's musical prowess, but they would have been better served releasing a separate live album. The album was their second straight top ten hit, peaking at number ten."
2,cd remix kills classic,"This was a great album and I had to have the cd. Unfortunatly when I recieved the disc and put it in to play, I was dissapointed to hear the studio side had been remixed. A ton of echo had been added. The drums had been remixed and the sound changed. The cymbals were burried in the mix. Small nuances that made the tracks interesting were also lost. The vocals are also covered with reverb. The original tight sound had been replaced with a muddy ""hall"" type sound. I have returned to listening to my cassette version of this album and feel ripped off by the cd remix. I wish I never bought it."
5,Excellent CD,The CD has excellent Sound qulaity. It has been remastered. Frankly I was l little concerned because I read other reviews that stated they went overboard with the effects. It just sounds clean and balanced to me. Plus you get previousley unreleased versions of Tush and Jailhouse rock.
1,Terrible Flavor,"The mix tasted terrible, no matter how much tequila and lime juice used. Yo are better off to purchase the liquid mix. I will not purchase again & do not recommend."
4,goood,"they are great for the price,soft grips, i was dissapointed though, when i saw that the ends are chrome plastic, but overall- great product"
4,The Coolest!,"I do not have this toy, but I know it's awesome because my cousin has it and we played with it. I reeeeally want it. You can set up the furniture however you want, and the lights even work! You have to get this toy. It's the coolest set MGA has made for Lil' Bratz!"
3,Bratz Toy for Girls,"I brought this for my daughter a few years ago, I think she enjoyed it. It was cute though."
4,costumes,"nice little book, detailing ways to change existing 20th century clothes into period costumes for theatre."
3,Flimsy Bulletin Board,"This board is a little flimsy or at least the way it was shipped in the box did not protect it. When delivered the box was bowed in the middle and upon opening it I could see that the corkboard (not really full cork) was fractured and split in several places. When I looked into what it would take to remedy this with Amazon (ship it back to them and pay) I just decided to fix it by gluing a 1/4"" luan plyboard on the back side to support the fracture section. This worked good and I finally hung it. I would consider buying the real oak frame, real corkboard, bulletin board next time."
1,Not worth the price,"Very flimsy board, with faux oak frame. Cork is very cheap and pins do not stay in it. Board was warped and backing was broken.I should of returned it, but it took so long to arrive I didn't have enough time to shop for a replacement."
5,A worship experience,"Mark Lowry has the marvelous gift of combining humor with a deep Christian message. He's a talented singer, too! He begins the show by poking fun at all the different denominations, and closes the show by reminding us that God loves us all the same.Actually, this concert could be called ""Mark Lowry and Friends,"" because he shares the stage with several artists who shine in their own segments. The list includes:Stan Whitmire: a talented pianistLordSong: a vocal trio comprised of husband and wife Michael and Kim Lord and their friend Amber FranksThe Isaacs: a gospel/bluegrass group without too much twang and with lovely family harmonyVocalists Reggie Smith, Michael English, and the legendary Bill GaitherThe ""ReMarkable"" choir: they don't just sing, they worship.At the close of the concert, Mark Lowry sings lead as the entire cast joins in on the powerful song, ""Isn't it Amazing?"" It is simply wonderful."
2,So-So,"I think Mark Lowry is absolutely hysterical. I love the way that he describes various life situations. I love the way that he can make light of trials that he has been through by using comedy. I love that he can still teach/preach through comedy. I also love that he has a beautiful singing voice. But, I don't necessarily want them blended together. This DVD is really good but I just didn't feel as if there was enough comedy and too much singing. I personally would have preferred if there was more comedy. It's a good and funny DVD and I definitely enjoyed it. If you are only a fan of Mark's singing or comedy, but not both, then I don't think you will enjoy this DVD as much (although you can fast forward through the parts you don't like). However, if you like everything about him, then you will love this DVD. I would definitely recommend it, especially for family viewing because it is good, clean and uplifting fun."
4,"Good, clean humor and great music","We originally rented this video from Netflix and were so impressed with it that we bought it to see again and share with friends. Mark is a character--truly a gifted comic and wonderful gospel singer. He has produced a masterfully done show for all ages. With all of the junk and cheap humor out there to be avoided, this DVD is worth getting and watching again and again."
4,An essential for every coffee lover.,"The essential for every coffee lover. The perfect way to brew gourmet coffee for one. Compact and easy to use, a must have for the coffee connoisseur."
4,Great Introduction,"This CD was our introduction to Zydeco music! I picked it up on a whim one day. When my children were small, they would dance and dance to this music until they dropped. It is a great CD and tons of fun! Because the kids loved ours, it got ruined years ago, but now that I've found it, I must order a new one."
5,Surprising,"This is a wonderfully surprising book. Simple predictable text makes this book and easy read aloud to young children and interesting illustrations that capture the imagination. This book also deals with pirates and treasure, but also the loss of a pet, which most children can relate to, but in a simple way. My three-year-old loves this book and can spend 20 minutes just flipping through the pages. I definately recommend this book for children 3 and up."
5,A Book For All Ages,"I fell in love with this story instantly. I've never seen empathy being presented so well. Plus the pictures tell their own story of adventure, death, friendship and woe. It's a simple book with few words for young readers, but the message is well delivered and I personally think it's a book that can be enjoyed by audiences of all ages."
5,Anne Shelton,I received this CD in new condition. I am very happy with it. I had been looking for a particular song on this CD for awhile. I'm glad that I finally got it. Joe Kennedy
2,"Nostalgic, but disappointing","""Best of Peter, Paul and Mary"" brought back some of the songs my wife and I remembered from this group, but the CD altogether was disappointing. Inexplicably, the worst selection is the well known ""Puff the Magic Dragon,"" which evidently was recorded at a live concert. All you can really hear is the chorus; the verses apparently were sung away from the microphone. Since that is such a trademark song for this group, this spoiled the rest of it. It really isn't worth the asking price."
2,It's Mono!,"Peter, Paul & Mary get 5 stars, the selection of this album is wonderful but, hang down your head, the sound engineer gets an F-for mastering it in mono instead of stereo. He must have been puffin' the magic dragon and ought to be hanged along with Tom Dooly for that. Leave the CD on a jet plane, and download all these songs in stereo from Kaza."
2,Some songs are not the origninal that appeared on the 1970 album,"Yes, the cd cover looks the same. However, some of the songs are not the orignial versions that first appeared on ""10 Years"" album back in the very early '70's. One very good example is ""Day Is Done."" Here they clearly used a different and updated version of this song. (Some things just shouldn't be messed with and this is one of them.)With the version that appeared on the original album is much more intense when they sing and there is not a child singing in the back ground. So as you listen to this cd version the first time, you may think to yourself that this is not the way you remembered exactly how that song went, you're right. It's an updated version that they have re-recorded later on. Still a great CD. Rated 2 stars because some versions are not the versions that first appeared on the original LP release when this came out on LP in 1970."
2,Not as good as the live performance video,"The tracks were flat. I don't know where they pulled them from, but they didn't have anywhere the near the energy that I expected. I saw the videos of the same songs on a PBS special, so my expectations might have been too high."
5,Not Just Nostalgia,"This recording is special. First of all, unlike many ""best of"" compilations, this one really is! Every song on the CD is just great. And, the songs aren't just copied off their albums, every track was remixed by Peter Yarrow of the group, and sounds even better than the original! I've got all their albums, but this is the one I listen to most. A top choice, both for long-time fans and for those who are new to their music and want to hear more."
1,What?!!!,"If you purchase this movie, this is the feeling/question you'll be left with. While Elba is convincing as a man who's mind devolves into delusion, the storyline is nearly non-existent, patchwork. Mental disorder is hard enough to capture as entertainment. It's even more difficult to present a story from only the perspective of a warped mind's concoctions. The film needed at least one other character's viewpoint to give the audience validation (or not) of the main character's perceptions. Unfortunately, this didn't happen, leaving the audience hostage to the constant question of reality or fantasy. All characters introduced, with the exception of two, were products of the main character's mind. While one was a peripheral character that was on screen for about 5 mins, the other was served as the story's villain. He is only glimpsed through the eyes of the sick character. The end is designed to make you think, but it doesn't go far enough (especially without at least one additional vantage)."
3,Storyline is powerful but confusing,"Not easy to watch, sometimes confusing but Indiris' performance is captivating. Became fascinated with the actor in the series 'Luther' and wanted to see how his ability transferred to another character. He's excellent but I didn't care for the story in this movie"
4,Airflow Antique Pedal Foretruck,"This is a super fun , quality toy. Grandson has had LOADS of fun with it when he received for birthday and continues to. The only draw back was that there were no assembly instructions in box. Took hub an hour or so to assemble. I expect this item to be around when grandson has children!"
3,My role model!,"This isn't the world's best book, but it certainly influenced my life since I read it in grade 3... about 30 years ago. Grandmother Oma is a kid's dream... she rollerskates, fights off mad bulls with her umbrella, and she knows that animals speak (with their ears and tails and noses!) . Looked down upon by her grownup son and other adults, she keeps her love of life, and retorts intelligently: "" 'Greeks liked swinging- not only their children, but also their priests and priestesses who used swings at their religious ceremonies'. This silenced the schoolmaster..."" A lesson for life... enjoy it and be yourself whatever your age. Don't grow old gracefully, grow old with pizzaz! Actually, I think it's time to read it again!"
1,DON'T TRUST FORZIERI,"I tried ordering a wallet from this company through Amazon, and they didn't send it! It was supposed to arrive by the 24th of Dec. for Christmas. When the date was approaching and I couldn't find any shipping information, I emailed them. I had to e-mail twice to get a response.They apologized that they didn't make the deadline. And they offered to include a ""put-the-blame-on-us card."" I cannot understand how this would make my gift arrive on time for Christmas--or that it would even matter.For a company that is supposed to be somewhat reputable, they are completely unprofessional. Why pay $10 for regular ground shipping for a product that won't even arrive!I even had to contact them BEFORE they would tell me about the problem! What would've happened if I didn't contact them? They were so blase about the whole order!!!! Is that customer service???I recommend choosing a different company!!!"
4,Leeds's first foray without Prince...almost,"Sax player Eric Leeds - known principally for his stinging punches of sound and burlesque-hot solos on various Prince records and as a key member of the defunct band Madhouse - steps out on his own on this hard-to-get record. It's got a number of Prince-penned tunes on here, but for the most part it's a smooth jazz record with some rounded edges. It's solid, though a pretty simple affair when compared to his later albums, which more firmly venture into traditional jazz territory. Doesn't quite have the complexity of his later work, but is his most accesible work to date.If you're into contemporary jazz that isn't just somebody blowing over top of a Fresh Prince beat and you can actually find it, it's worth buying."
4,Good Solid Specialist Dictionary,"The Longman Dictionary of Language Teaching and Applied Linguistics provides a concise place where the language teacher or language researcher can find definitions of terms they don't remember in their field of specialization. It gives not only lengthy contextualized definitions but also provides references for those who want to look deeper into a topic. The dictionary also provides cross references to other relevant definitions.The only thing that might be considered in revision is putting the words into categories under specialization as a possible appendix (i.e. sociolinguistics, language testing, psycholinguistics). This might help and entice the reader to look at the dictionary as a learning tool as well as a reference tool. This would provide an additional way to use the dictionary in order to learn specific vocabulary for a specialization under the umbrella of applied linguistics or language teaching."
5,oil free,I have oily skin and I use 2 sheets a day to absorb off the oil from my face.works like a charm. best method I found is to put a sheet on a pillow and just plant your face right on it for 30sec each area.really cheap and those packs seem to last forever lol.
5,LASSIE-FROM JEFF TO TIMMY--PART TWO,"To anybody who hasnt i suggest you buy this video and youll see why even if youre not a lassie fans, why the jump the shark webpage says jeff miller was a real kid and you'll also get to see space travler and the mascot which i have stated previously portray timmy martin not as an adorable angel as he seems to be in Christmas Story or even as a super boy scout, in the tv story joey which isnt on this tape he gives lassie away to a blind boy but you'll see him-at least to me- as a regular non-cute non-bratty kid in space traveler and the mascot, in the mascot you see an african-american portrayed positively in 1959, So buy this , it may change any previous ideas you have about lassie, jeff and especially Timmy"
5,Where can I buy Lassie videos in England,Can you tell me where I can buy a collection of Lassie videos in ENGLAND. I've search the net but can't find anywhere. They are for a friend that has learning difficulties and he loves to watch Lassie if it's shown on the television.
5,The one and only SAP archiving guide!!!,"Clear and concise guide to R/3 archiving!!.This book gives a clear and concise approach to archive the business data in the R/3-System. What is most useful is that the customizing is explained. I think this is one of the most useful sapbooks. By reading this EXCELLENT book i have learned how to analyze the sap database, how to allocate the relevant sap archiving objects and how to design the tools to access the archived data.As an experienced SAP consultant, I found this book extremely useful, comprehensive and concise."
3,A little weak on illustrations,"This book has some useful and informative discussion of the construction methods but if you intend to purchase only one book on the subject, then you are better off with GRAPHIC GUIDE TO FRAME CONSTRUCTION by Thallon."
5,Just what we needed,This book doesn't presuppose that you know how to frame a house. It starts at the low level and teaches. That's what I hoped and that's what I got
4,Great Illustrations,"This book has great illustration for wood framing. Recommend it: however, it would be nice to have a CD on all the drawings illustrated in the book."
5,A Must Have if You're Hebrew Isn't Perfect,"This is a top-notch biblical reference and a must-have for your language shelf. Obviously, you don't want to become too dependent on it; but it can certainly get you out of a bind when you are stuck in a corner."
4,Old but good,"If you are seriously working to translate an ancient foreign language, an analytical lexicon is a godsend. Instead of you wracking your brain to remember which obscure tense and verb stem you are looking at (or deciding whether or not you are looking at a verb at all), you can consult your analytical lexicon, which tells all.This book is from the long lost days of British biblical scholarship, being first published in 1850. However, first, Benjamin Davidson remains one of the great names in the study of ancient Hebrew, and secondly, what we know about ancient Hebrew has changed very little, so its lack of modernity is no handicap.I heartily recommend it to the serous student, scholar, and would-be translator."
5,Historia Verdadera Conq. Nueva Espana,"This book was written by one of the best known historians of the 1500's. It tells you in detail the atrocities committed by the spanish conquerors in what is now Mexico, and most of Central America in order to provide glory and riches to the spanish crown. It provides an understanding of the decadence of what once was the mighty Mayan civilization, and the great Aztec empire. No other culture, or people in the history of the world has suffered what the indigenous of the new world has been through, and no other culture, or people has survived with such great courage, preserving their native tongues, and rich cultures as the mayans have in one of the worst places to be, their homelands, or what was then called by the Spaniards ""El Reyno de Guatemala"" (The Kingdom of Guatemala)."
3,Not a bad story,"I enjoy reading books like Unlikely Angel. Obviously, God wants her alive! I pray that she will continue to allow God to ""perfect' her life, and that I will someday meet her in heaven."
1,Blood money,"A preposterous account, believed by the simple-minded.And, which is worse, facilitated by the pimpin' press, who have canonized this mendacious dope fiend as a ""hero.""She's already taken $70,000 in loot, so don't add to her ill-gotten gains."
1,"Hi, I'm Ashley Smith and I'm a meth head.","First off, she got 70,000 dollars from the city of Atlanta for helping to get this man to turn himself in, second she has probably spent it all on meth and now needs more drug money so shes written a book. Unless you wanna read things like, ""I was not going to die tonight and stand before God, having done a bunch of ice up my nose."" then don't give this woman anymore drug money. Trust me, it's going to go right up her nose. She's not very eloquent, and doing more meth will not help her become more so."
2,Please don't spend your money on this book,"This book was painful to listen to. I listen to audio books on my long drives and I almost immediately stopped listening as the author's voice was grating. I only kept listening because I was curious as to the whole story. Instead this was a very repetitive narrative, mostly of her life before the incident. The professionals involved in this production should have a) convinced her to let a professional reader narrate the book and b) should have done their job of editing. Like other reviewers I was more interested in the story behind Brian Nichols. Instead we got her version only and very little of it was of the actual incident, she must have mentioned her husbands death years before at least 12 times. If you are at all interested in this story, use your local library and save your money for a good book."
3,Let's be reasonable...,"She's just a human being. She was put into the national spotlight and everyone's trying to use her to suit their own point of view--making her an extraordinary hero or an utter hypocrite. In reality she's just a person, facing problems, trying to get her life together. She's taken the momentary celebrity/book deal/etc. as an opportunity (I believe) to sincerely make her best efforts at moving forward. The book itself if fairly honest at making that point. In the end, it's an ok book but I think there are many other titles out there that can better inspire your faith or thrill you with suspense. As a book itself, I think it's really a 2 star (sorry) but I'm giving it three stars because I think the trash talking is really unfair."
2,REPETITIVE REPETITIVE REPETITIVE,"TOO MANY INNOCUIOUS DETAILS! ALSO I FELT LIKE I READ SAME CHAPTER OVER AND OVER. COULD NOT BELIEVE THERE WAS NO LIFE HISTORY OF BRIAN NICHOLS. I WAS REALLY CURIOUS OF HOW HE ""FELL"" SINCE HE WAS QUITE PRODUCTIVE AT SOME TIME. HOW COULD THIS GET WRITTEN WITHOUT HIS BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATIONS? ALSO WHAT WAS ASHLEYS LIFE STORY. ALL I READ WAS METH, PAIGE- WILL I EVER SEE YOU AGAIN? AND MACK DIED IN A ALTERCATION. THIS DOESN'T MAKE MUCH SENSE. WHERE IS THE STORY?????"
2,Unlikely the Whole Story,"Initially, I'd said that I'd NEVER read this story, but I was able to buy the book for a $1, so . . . IF Ashley's encounter with Brian Nichols is what it took to get her off drugs, make her a better mom to Paige, and strengthen her faith in God, then God bless her. I'm not judging, but I do have an opinion: Every story has three sides; this was Ashley's. We haven't really heard Brian's, and then . . .there's the truth. The story was probably great therapy for Ashley, but I think this is her version. I read it; it was ok, but I'm convinced that Ashley and Brian knew each other and a lot more happened in that apartment than what she wrote in the book. I wish the best for her and Paige . .. and Brian. He's guilty of killing three people, but there are probably some other folks out here who should feel some guilt for what happened. What he did was an act of a desperate man. Book - ok! Buy it somewhere for a $1."
3,It was okay.,"I read this in its entirety last night, not because it was great but because I wanted to return it to the library today for the next person on the waiting list.Ashley had an interesting story to tell, but I really didn't like how she told it. I wanted to read just what happened that night and some background info about her and Brian Nichols. She keeps stopping the action and feeding the reader stories of her husband's death, how hard it was being a drug addict, her religious beliefs, etc. Everytime the story started getting - dare I say, exciting - she would start going on and on about something in the past. Boring!I would have liked to hear more about Brian. I know it's not his book but surely she must have asked more questions than ""do you believe in miracles?"" Yawn."
4,Unlikely Angel - Ashley Smith,"This book is a must read. I have known Ashley Copeland Smith for most of her life, and I am very proud of her strength of character and courage in the face of definite evil. Yes, she has had a very difficult life, but her decision to have her aunt raise her daughter was not made lightly. Her aunt is a trusted family member, and someone that Ashley knew would take care of Paige until she got her life back in order. You don't see too much in the media about her aunt, but I can assure you that she is also an angel... guardian angel over Ashley and Paige. The faith that this family holds so dear is apparent in all that they do. Ashley, don't listen to all of the nay-sayers. You are a real gem, and I am proud to have known you over the years. This is a great book, and I see it being a beacon for many others who have faced what you have faced. Keep up the good work, and continue to grow in faith."
2,I'm Not Sure what We were Expecting!,"Frankly I didn't learn much from the book that I hadn't already read. After all, this story came out when there wasn't much ""real"" news going on, and was milked by the media for all it was worth. I was one of those who watched and read everything I could find, and I admired Ms. Smith. Not much changed with the publication of the book. If we had read between the lines just a tiny bit, we would have known she was not an angel, so that's not what I was looking for. I was looking for bravery and inspiration. I was not disappointed.THE BOOK IS WHAT IT IS! My only disappointment with Ashley Smith is the way she is pushing Rick Warren's book. Twice now I have seen her on television posing on the steps of what appears to be a government building holding Rick Warren's Purpose Driven Life.A book, any book, should stand on its own merits. Otherwise it's not worth your time."
4,Better Than Most.,"I give it 4 stars because I never met any officer in Vietnam, or anywhere else, like Kirschke describes himself. And I certainly didnt meet any Kirschke's in Vietnam. So the book doesnt resonate with my experience. But, I suppose anything is possible. Still, the book is interesting and well-written; better than most of this genre. And that's the bottom-line."
3,Difficult Read,"Although the content of the book was on par with the manyViet Nam books that I have read, the poor wording and punctuation made it adifficult read. I found myself having to re-read many sentences to make surethat I understood them. Perhaps, our author who has graduate degrees inEnglish, did not get to proof read the final product."
5,Great condition!,"It is in great condition and is a nice clean copy. With this book so difficult to find, I was glad to have such a good copy."
1,poorly described,"The description says ""Oak Finish Frame, Natural Finish"" It actually was a sticker-like ""finish"" Instead of real wood it had the wood grain as a sticker! Very ugly! Plus the sticker was peeling back at the corners. I returned it immediately!"
4,Good: Take care unpacking,It is a nice looking board that was easy to hang and is holding up well under moderate use. The frame is a little flimsy. It cracked while we were unpacking the board. We were able to hide the crack when we mounted it. Be careful unpacking.
2,Square shape after wash,I'd say it looks like a typical men's tee - very loose. It changed it's shape and became shorter and squarish after a couple of washes.
1,Rough Fabric,"The shirt shipped promptly. The color, design, and size met my expectations. But the fabric is rough, too rough and scratchy to wear comfortably. Also the hem began to unravel in the first wash. The only value of the shirt to me will be to polish candlesticks. I can't recommend it as clothing."
1,"cheap, thin wrong size not PRIME","AMAZON DID NOT DELIVER IN TWO DAYS AS PROMISED BY PRIME, SHIRT MIS-MARKED LOOKED LIKE A SAIL - SEE THROUGH CHEAP ""COTTON"" TOO LONG OF A TAIL FOR LADIES LOOK ELSEWHERE."
1,Runs HUGE,I normally wear a Women's L or XL in t-shirts or a Men's M. These t-shirts fit my husband who wears an XL. I was very unhappy.
2,Are you kidding...,Early L'Amour that focused more on getting to the end of the story then telling it. The story was disjointed. More a series of short vignettes encased in a longish short story format. Not really a novel at all.
3,"""Opposite sides of the law, but always friends.""",Bijah Catlow and Ben Cowan grew up together; saved each others' life many times and even had a few good fights. It didn't come close to what they ended up involved in when they grew up and Ben became a U.S. Marshal and Catlow became an outlaw; but of couse not intentionaly. There is excitment here and danger on the lighter side and as always L'Amour leaves you feeling like you could figure our a way across the desert running from the Mexican Army. You will sure know how to find hidden water holes.
3,The Right and the Wrong Sides of the Law,"Much more lighthearted than many of L'Amours works, the story of two chi ldhood friends who wind up on both sides of the law. The times were changing, th e open range was disappearing, and the big cattle ranchers did not want any new competitors. Bijah Catlow, branding maverick calves, is declared an outlaw and decides to become one. Ben Cowan, his childhood friend, has grown up to become a Deputy United States Marshall."
1,I don't read Spanish,"I was unable to read this book because it is writen in Spanish, which I don,t read. Amazon does a poor job of letting the customer know when a book is not written in English."
2,You get what you pay for,"I ordered two packages of these mailers and am not very happy. I've pulled out about 10 to use and 7 of them have ripped as I opened them to put the packages in. I got what I paid for. These are also not the nice thick poly mailers, but I think they'll do what I want. I won't buy them again."
4,"Great Poly Mailers, just make sure you know the size you need","These poly mailers work flawlessly and are strong enough for regular mailing needs. Just realize that the picture of a shirt going into the bag isn't the 10X13 size. Order larger if you need to ship shirts, sweaters or larger items."
4,Satisfied with product,I ordered these to mail calendars in for my business. I still have to go to the post office bulk mail center to be sure I can use these for bulk mail. I thought they were a great bargain -
5,Large mailers,I am very happy with the white poly mailer envelope bags.They seem very sturdy and should do the job for the products that I ship.
3,Just ok,"Came in a timely manner, but for my needs they are too thin. I have to double bag to feel like what I am shipping is strong enough. I mail clothing to customers, far distances, so need something more secure. Unfortunately, I would not order again. May be good for someone else."
5,Perfect for shipping clothing,"My wife and I have been selling our children's clothing as they are growing out of them, and these bags are perfect for mailing the items via USPS and UPS.The seal is great, and Sharpie markers work perfectly for marking them."
4,"Good size, okay quality","A few have torn at the self stick part, but that's not too bad. These work for my business and are thicker which I like. All in all good for the price."
5,Super !,"I have used these for my shop for a long time, They are super durable and big enough to fit anything. If you need it smaller they can be cut to fit to size. For the price, super great deal!."
4,Tough bags,The bags are a tough plastic; they don't seem like they will tear easily. I was hoping for something that was stiffer or had some kind of protection.
3,"These bags are GRAY, not white!","I purchased these bags for mailing clothing. They seem strong enough for that and the price was great, so I'm going to give them a try. I give them 3 stars because they are very thin and are actually GRAY, not white."
5,Great product!,"Exactly what I was looking for--lightweight (so you don't have to pay much more postage), very durable and ""flexible"", and easy to use. Will never go back to manila envelopes."
1,You pay for what you get but ...,"You don't necessarily get what you pay for. Nothing is a bargain if it is unusable!First and foremost, I see no way to securely address these envelopes. I tried ink and marker. Both simply WIPE OFF! The surface is slicker than a ziplock bag with no opaque surface on which to write the return and ship to addresses. That is an essential feature for any mailer. Without the ability to address an envelope, it is useless at any price!I considered using address labels but there are enough negative reviews from those who have already tried and failed at getting labels to stick. Who wants to risk a package being returned or worse, wind up in a ""dead mail"" bin because the address became detached or illegible during shipping?Secondly, these bags are GRAY not white as advertised. That fact is not a big deal for me but the description is incorrect. Either way, these go back to the shipper and I will go back to the pricier but reliable Tyvek envelopes.Disappointed!"
1,Useless bags,"just bought bags from TheGroupDeal. These bags don't work at all. the stickers don't stick to the slick surface. I've purchased these bags for years, but this time - useless. I would try the bags again, but absolutely not from TheGroupDeal."
4,Learned my lesson,"Just re-ordered these bags after learning my lesson the hard way...Last time I cheaped-out and bought the low cost high qty bags which are ok if you're sending something with no dimension, i.e. paper, but our item is bulky and sometimes apparently gets caught in the postal machines. The cheap bags get destroyed along with the contents getting mangled or lost entirely, these bags can at least survive the US Postal Service (along with the contents)."
5,Exactly what I hoped it would be.,"They were exactly what I hoped for and only wish that I had ordered a slightly larger size, but so far they have met all of my needs."
1,Worthless for mailing books,"I purchased this after reading good reviews,but when I used these to ship textbooks the poly mailer bags were shredded by postal machines and I actually received just pieces of the envelopes with to books missing. I received so many complaints that Amazon actually cancelled my seller account after over 15 years of selling. They are ok for lightweight paperbacks, but college textbooks should never be sent in these mailers even with extra taping. Totally useless."
3,Thinner then other brands,"I bought these instead of a different brand from another seller, and these are much thinner. I do not like them at all. If you are using them to ship, buy another brand as these are almost tissue paper thin, no protection at all."
1,"Very disappointed that these plastic bags are listed under BUBBLE MAILERS!! They are NOT BUBBLE MAILERS, just plastic bags:(","Very disappointed that these plastic bags are listed under BUBBLE MAILERS!! They are NOT BUBBLE MAILERS, just plastic bags:(When I search for bubble mailers there are a few companies that have just plastic bags listed as Poly Mailers (very misleading as the others are Poly bubble mailers). Tricky!! Take your listing out of bubble mailers!"
5,Perfect!,Love these mailers...they are perfect for sending out the tops we sell. They are very sturdy without adding additional ounces to the package. I've reordered a second set of these.
2,"They are ok, but if you need more","They were ok, but I tend to buy mine from BagsOnTheNet.com. They were very helpful and even offered me a custom bag with my company logo. Can't buy small quanities for the custom but it's an option."
4,"Useful and enjoyable picture, price guide for collectors.","The comprehensive Campbell's Soup collectors guide will help you identify the many products produced over the years, and estimate their value. It is loaded with razor sharp pictures of over 600 items and includes prices of more than 1,700. Easy to use, as it is arranged in alphabetical order by category of collectible. Provides the collector with a guide of what to pay for items you intend to buy. Each category includes an interesting and useful history and summary of the category. Every Campbell's collector will find this up-to-date book of value."
5,VeryBesst of Fred Waring and the Pennsylvanians,This was just what I wanted for my CD's of Fred Waring. Thanks to everyone who helped me obtain this item.
4,A Fine Collection of Traditional Irish Music,This is a very enjoyable collection of traditional Irih music by a variety of artists.
5,Great book!,This book is the first book in the Texan series. 1. The Texan Star. 2. The Texan Scouts. I highly recommend both books. But get book number 1 first.
3,History in person,"Well written. Primarily for teens and preteens who want a more personal view of the events surrounding the Texan war with Mexico for independence. The main character who views and participates in the major events is a teen. Alsheler has written several series of his type. It gives a more intimate view of the crises in the early history of this country, especially west of the Allegheny mountains. than you are likely to get from conventional history books. More fun to read too. I originally read these books when I was an early teen and remembered them favorably through all these years."
5,Huge Difference,"Wow! I guess I never heard this recording before, just some third rate remix. I bought the ZZ Six Pack years ago, then upgraded to the single CDs to get the real drums.This orignal mix sure is far different than those! All for the better! I've bought many CDs over and over again -- Zeppelin, Elton, Hendrix -- but this remaster is by far the most dramatic improvement! The drums are right in your face for one thing. The clarity of the all the instruments is stunning.The extra live tunes are really raw and hint at the tone Billy uses on the new ZZ Top recordings.Its a must buy!"
2,Remixed For Your Inconvenience,"Beware!!! When This Album Was Released On CD In The Early 90's They Used The Remixed Version That Appears On The ZZ Top Six Pack Compilation. In Todays Music World It's A Horrid Representation Of A Great Classic Rock Album (It, And The First Album, Rio Grande Mud, Fandango, Tejas & El Loco All Sound Like ""Eliminator"" & ""Afterburner"" Clones. Go To Your Nearest 2nd Hand Store And Find Them On Vinyl or Cassette. Until Then We Can Only Hope ZZ Top & Warner Bros. Get Their Act Together, Hmmmm...Calling Rhino Records?"
2,Great Music - Absolutely Terrible Remix,"I read reviews regarding what a horrible job of remixing was done to this album. I should have heeded them. They were right on target - buy the vinyl - skip the CD. I think that this album was one of ZZ's best ever. The songs are unparelled on any of their other albums. What was done to this album during the remix should have been a crime. It's tinny, hollow and void of any bass. The vocals are unbalanced and completely change the original tone of the album. I grew up cranking this album during hot summer nights and partying to this with the intensity it offered. What a criminal thing to do to ruin a classic like this through the disgraceful mixing job done to this album. Somebody find the guy that did this and deport him to the ends of the earth - never let the slug touch a remixing machine again. Disgraceful."
2,Who remastered this Masterpiece?,"There's no doubt about the musical quality of this album, but it sounds like the band were playing in the inside of a tunnel. I'm so disappointed, because I first bought the ""Six Pack"", and looking for the original sound I've bought TRES HOMBRES. Surprise it's the same remastered recording¡"
3,They gagged Dusty Hill,"To sing the way he did on this album Billy Gibbons swallowed a frog and put a peg on his nose. He then proceeded to boast about all the sex he's paid for out of the corner of his mouth as if it were some great accomplishment.But this whole nasally fake bluesman facade wears thin by the end of the album. However there's enough good rock music (and nasty guitar playing) on here to justify a pass mark. 2 1/2 is about right, but worth rounding up to 3 if need be."
5,ZZ Top's Best Album!,"Originally released in 1973, ZZ Top make the most out of 3-chord boogie here! Classic tracks such as: ""La Grange"", ""Move Me On Down The Line"", ""Have You Heard"", ""Master Of Sparks"", and ""Precious And Grace"" make this an album you can put on and play through without skipping any tracks. It's also been remastered and remixed, so it sounds better than the original analog issue. Definitely their most memorable album (their first 2 albums: ""First Album"" and ""Rio Grande Mud"" run a close second place too). I saw ZZ Top down in Austin TX in 1973 during the ""Tres Hombres"" tour, so this disc brings back a lot of good memories for me. It's a great party CD too!"
5,is it worth it?,"Now, I've always been very skeptical about so called reissues and so called original masters, because these products rarely show any signs of improved sound compared to the old records from way back then. Well, this one really stands out. I've played it alongside with my Lp from the 80's and it sounds amazing.The clarity, and the attack from the instruments hit you right in the face, and the sound is groovy and fresh. This is more like it is supposed to be experienced, so it is worth it. No regrets,buy it and get Fandango too. ZZ Top never sounded better than on these great vinyl reissues."
5,180-Gram Vinyl Mastering by Hoffman/Gray Rocks the House,"If you love the blues and you've got a turntable, you owe it to yourself to buy this album. Steve Hoffman and Kevin Gray have captured every single ""whine of the twine"" in this guitar tour-de-force. The band fills the listening room, meaty and powerful, but all the instrumental textures are clear and beguilingly present. A wonderful job all-around from this extraordinary mastering team--and a little old band from Texas.Be aware that the ""worst"" review applies to a remastered CD issue, not to this treasure. Rest assured that this is the original mix, straight from the analog two-track master, sounding better than it ever has before."
5,one of their classics! ....probably their best,"...Well this is probably ZZ Top's best album ever . Its not my personal favorite , but still really good .This was the album that saw them get some air play with ""La Grange"" and introduced ZZ Top to a much wider audience . Funny thing is though that when a lot of people where I lived first heard Billy Gibbons'vocals they didnt like the band because they thought the vocalist was black (seriously). But after seeing what the band looked liked loved 'em (a little weird isnt it) . Or better yet a few people swore that ""La Grange"" was T-bone Walker....Anyway you really cant go wrong buying this album , you will like something about it!"
5,"Best Top album, hands down","A true masterpiece with a Tex/Mex/desert/blues groove that defies description. The arrangements and production are outstanding (esp. slide guitar). If you've never listended to Top's early stuff, put some headphones on an give it a listen -- this one will blow your mind!"
5,This is unquestionably ZZ Top's Best,"I was once asked if I were to be stranded on a desert island, what 10 albums would I want to be stranded with. This was the first on my list. Enough said."
3,LP to 8 track to CD,"I have the original verson of Jesus just left chicago, and he does place quite a bit of CCCHHHIIICCCAAAGGGOO, so, your are part right, the remaster does place a bit more, but the originla had quite a bit."
1,The remix kills it,"I LOATHE the remixed sound of this album. Here in Dallas, we have two stations that play this song. One plays the original version and when this new station came on, I heard what sounded like a studio modeled piece of crap from the 80's. Not until tonight when I read these reviews did I realize they did exactly that. Remixed it in the 80's... for heaven knows what reason.Get the original version in a secondhand store, for this one truly sucks.... It stinks that you can't get their arguably best album in it's original form. I'm really bummed out now.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY UNTIL ZZ TOP REALIZE WHAT A MISTAKE THEY MADE BY DOING THIS AND FIX THE PROBLEM!!!"
2,5 out of 5 for the music.....as for the production,"For any collector of music,a majority of CD reissues are faithful(or can even enhance)the original production. Alas, with Tres Hombres (in my opinion ZZ Top's finest album, and a rock classic to boot), the drums have been remixed with something similar totheir 80's offerings. (Which are fine by the way, but do not belong here) It has ruined the sound and overlooked some of the excellent musicianship on the original recordings. The same applies to the album `Tejas' I would ignore this issue till Warner Bros decide to reissue early ZZ Top with respectful and decent remastering, such as that shown in the `Chrome, Smoke and BBQ' boxset and `Rancho Texicano' (Very Best Of), where Engineer and remastering expert Bob Ludwig has done a faithful and exceptional job. As for now, those with fond memories of ZZ Top on the vinyl versions, will be in for a nasty shock."
4,Classic ZZ Top stuff,"To my mind, ""Tres Hombres"" is one of the best records ZZ Top made (there should be no doubt about no 1, which is ""Deguello""). The album features very strong songs and some weaker ones, which leaves me feeling that the album could have been more impeccable.Best songs on this record are ""Waiting for the bus"", ""Jesus just left Chicago"", ""Precious and grace"" and ""La Grange"". Weakest are ""Move me .."", ""Shiek"" and ""Have you heard ?"" that simply aren't convincing and are lacking inspiration. ""Shiek"", for example, seems to be exotic for the sake of being exotic (""I met a shiek from Mozambique"").Although not perfect, ""Tres Hombres"" is a very good ZZ Top record. It's one of those records that sounds best in a car, and it often does.Hans Wigman."
5,Tres Hombres,"I had this, originally, on vinyl, then, later, I bought the CD of 1990. That CD always impressed me with its incredible drum sounds. I bought this because it was remastered & had three bonus cuts.This was the first Top album I ever bought & I now consider it to be second only to Eliminator. This album was the one that broke Z Z Top into the public with ""La Grange"", ""Waitin' For the Bus"" & ""Jesus Just Left Chicago"" which are still some of my favorite Top songs. ""Beer Drinkers and Hell Raisers"" is an excellent album cut. Normally, Rhino does an excellent job on the remastering process but, here, I found the drums to be somewhat subdued. So, I have mixed feelings on that regard. The three bonus cuts are all live versions of the three best known songs from this album. That's okay, but it's no great shakes in my book. After more than thirty years I still enjoy listening to this album."
5,zz top tres hombres,great to hear it again. always wanted to buy it again. brings back memories.the first 3 albums were the best.jojo
4,Tres Great,"ZZ Top's third album, Tres Hombres was their breakthrough album and helped make them stars. The album perfectly captures their blues & boogie Texas sound. Billy Gibbons' menacing vocals and scowling guitars drive the sound while bassist Dusty Hill and drummer Frank Beard provide a rock solid backbeat. ""La Grange"" starts off with mumbled lyrics over a shuffling beat before driving full-force into a guitar explosion on the chorus. ""Beer Drinkers & Hell Raisers"" is something of an anthem for the band and ""Jesus Just Left Chicago"" shows their strong blues roots. The album peaked at number eight on the charts and is still the band's finest effort."
5,Tres Hombres,I was a great gift for my wife for Christmas. She had the album but did not have the cd.
5,The best zz top of all time,"This record surpasses all other zz tops efforts, Beer drinkers and hell raisers, as well as La grange, and Jesus just left Chicago are just some of the tracks you will enjoy on this one"
5,"Most likely, Thier best album","This album is easily, Thier best album. This album includes. Beer Drinkers and Hell Raisers, Precious and Grace, and La Grange. Which i think make the album the best. Move Me On Down The Line is Stellar. I think this album is a must own for ZZ Top fans and also for Rock N Roll fans. If you decide to buy this album, You won't be disappointed."
2,Great Album; Awful Re-mix,"I'm sure most Classic Rock radio listeners know at least two or three cuts from this album, and in my opinion, the rest of the album is as good as or better than any of the singles from it. I have to agree with the reviewers who are panning this CD only because of the horrible re-mixes. I wore out a few copies of this album on vinyl and cassette back in the day, but if I sell my copy of the CD, it can be labeled ""Played Only Once!"" I'll wait for the re-release of the original mix, hoping there will be one."
3,Self-Stick Easel Pads - Plain White,"In general, these are great. The paper is thick enough that markers do not bleed through to the next page.My only complaint is that the pad came to me folded in a box. Thus, all the pages have a nice crease across the middle. If I were using this paper for a professional presentation, I would have send it back."
4,Good product - Terrible packaging,"The product itself is a great product for presentations, and we use them all the time. So my 4 stars is based on that.With that said, the packaging this came in was terrible - just two cardboard sheets taped over the pads, resulting in the pads having several pages damaged. Needed them the next day or I would have asked for an exchange. Odd because my little Post-It tabletop flipchart (which appeared to come from the same Amazon warehouse) was packaged superbly."
4,Giant Post-it Pad,I found this giant pad of sticky paper to be more convenient to use than an easel. The adhesive is super sticky but you can remove it without any problems or leaving any marks. No more issues with knocking over easels and one less bulky item to carry.
5,Great for the classroom,"These were bought to use in a classroom, and they work really well. It's nice to have the option to either keep a page or set of pages on the easel or stuck to each other, hang them around the classroom or save them for later as a packet. The price on Amazon was much better than the office supply store I almost bought them from. I was glad to see that the Amazon application on my phone got these to me 2 days later. It was a nice purchase."
1,WAS GIVEN THE WRONG INFO ON THE CHARTS NO LINES,"I WAS TOLD BY YOUR AGENT THAT THERE WERE LINES ON THE CHARTS, BUT THERE WERE NOT, I WOULD HAVE SENT THEM BACK BUT I NEEDED THEM RIGHT AWAY, SO I HAD TO GO THROUGH THE TROUBLE OF DRAWING ALL THE LINES IN, IT TOOK SEVERAL HOURS, I COULD HAVE BOUGHT THE CHARTS THAT HAD NO LINES MUCH CHEAPER, I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH AMAZON FOR GIVING ME THE WRONG INFO, ALSO I WILL BE CALLING CUSTOMER SERVICE ABOUT THIS."
5,Great Hoodie. Just heavy enough to be warm,"This hoodie is great for night games. I love it and got lots of comments at the stadium. Thanks,"
4,A Modern Ska Compilation,"With ""18 bands from all over the world"" including heavyweights such as Six Feet Deep and Bim Skala Bim, ""We Don't Skare"" is a great ska compilation. One of my fav's is ""Hello Everybody"" a bouncy, brassy bit by Germany's Ngobo Ngobo (""No go-by, now go boy"").If you're lucky enough to get your hands on it for under $20, it's well worth the money."
2,not the BoA she used to be,"This album is FAR inferior from her first and second. With every album release, her voice deteriorates just a bit more. Now she sounds very nasally and stuffed, as if she has a very bad nasal congestion. This is a real shame since she has some good songs. I don't know if her voice change is related to nose surgery or what, but the end result is not pretty."
5,memorie brought back,i rember when i was seven i got one for crihstmas i couldnt wait to get it it was easy to do the mixes were great i loved making them for my mom and dad i learnd a lot about cooking and math plus the sugar cookie dough was great i like bakeing and i still do now i do reciebes like red velvet cake from scrach and oatmeal and i eaven make my old food i still think it is fun even now that im twelve so do somthing for you kids and get this item
2,Not So Easy Bake,"The easy bake mixes cost you ...and the mixes you bake are about the size of two cookies. Besides, I don't think they are very tasty. You are better off buying store mixes and baking them in your own oven. I am sure your daughters would enjoy that much more. Easy bake oven can become very costly if you keep buying their mixes. I got rid of our easy bake oven within a few short months."
2,you can buy it its ok,its ok sure its educational but on my moms b-day we were trying to make a cake it didn't work we fallowed the instructions and everything but it came out powder sure it might work for you but it didn't work for me but if you think you want to buy it go ahead give it a try it sure is educational.
4,easy bake oven,I liked the easy bake oven.The only thing is the lightbulb was really hard to find.Finnaly after 2 weeks of hunting for the standard bulb that the oven needed. we finnaly found one on sale at walgreens. The soft white bulb worked fine but you have to put 12 extra min. Also we tried the crystal clear one and the cookies really cooked. The oven mixes were a kittle diffrent tasting but fine after you have a drink of milk. Overall the oven was really fun. This is a great christmas gift for kids.
5,I WISH I COULD RATE IT HIGHER!,"This is one of the funest toys we have ever had. We got it for my sister when she was about 6 or 7 (now she's fifteen). We gave our old one to a rummage sale at our church.This toy is very fun, and it actually makes real food- it doesn't come out powdery or look like when you just put it in the oven- and you can eat it too! Sure it's like [$$$], but it's worth the cost!This product is also educational. It teaches kids to follow recipies and if the food doesn't turn out right, it's because you didn't follow the recipe.When we donated this, this was still a working toy and in good condition. It's not too messy, but I would suggest cleaning it every month or so and spreading newspaper down on the counter/table.All in all, this is one good toy. I'm 12, and I want it again!Thank you, Hasbro!"
4,this is great,This was a great present. I loved it. I am 7 years old. I used it once to bake a cake and I suggest you buy it if your child likes to bake. It was fun to do with my parents. I can't wait to bake with it again.
2,Are the cookies done YET????,"I have tried making cookies with this, but it takes a REALLY long time and the cookies don't turn out that great. Still, I think it's fun making your own cookies and other treats without using a real oven!"
5,A great way to make treats (without a real oven!),"I jus got this and I also got the blender and mixer (jus like my mommy!) Well, this toy is very good and if you cant find a 100 wt. light bulb you can use a 75 wt. one but you have to leave the food in there for an extra 10-12 mins. I love this oven!!!"
5,Every little girl needs one.,"Its a classic.Its more durable than I expected, often second and third generation versions of classic toys are cheaply made, but this one is fine. Ive never had a single problem with it in the year we've had it.My daughter is only 3 now (2 when we bought it) so I have to help a lot, but I let her do as much as possible, and she loves it.Its great to get your children started in cooking. We also cook at the big stove together, but this is nice because I always know that I have all the ingrediants (mix and water lol)and it doesnt make much mess or dirty a lot of dishes.So easy too!The yellow cake and choclate Icing is yummy! the sugar cookies are pretty good too. The rest of the things Ive had has been so-so. You kids will like it though I'm sure. :)"
3,No light bulb,"Christmas Morning my son was thrilled when he saw that Santa had brought him this toy- we stuck the stickers on, mixed the cookie mix and plugged it in. Nothing happened- It does not come with the all important light bulb. You need to get a 100 watt plain bulb (not soft white). Needless to say, its a cute toy but my son was so upset that he could not use the toy on Christmas day. Just a warning...Get the light bulb! :)"
1,ok lets be serious,I might not be the greatest director user out there but i am very interested in the 3d area of director to bring my 3d models to life. Sure a lot of us are great 3d modelers but this book does not cover the real core of what director is able to do in the 3d field. This book is more of a just look at the surface of the 3d power of director and thats it. Basically nothing really hardcore about it and this auther or people that help out to make this really dont cover anything . The whole book is basically rush. I thought hey its going to be cool because its a fast but you wont learn nothing really. You might as well just copy and paste the codes within the book and thats it.
3,We still miss Miss Branigan,"The collection is fine, and includes many of the hits missed on previous collections. Still the collection in my opinion is missing some serious stuff from Miss Branigan's career. Some the songs on this cd may have been hits in others countries, but they were never hits in the US or Canada. I for one would enjoy seeing a 2 cd collection that actually includes all of her major hits, plus some of the lesser one. They also seem to always miss includeing tracks from the cd ""Over my Heart""."
5,Great Album!,Great compliment of songs and definitely a collector's dream. Can't recommend it any higher!!!
5,An amazing talent @}->---,"Fans of Laura still miss her. It's sad to know there will never be new music from this amazing vocalist. She was so talented and had one of the most under appreciated voices around.This also, would be one of the first Greatest Hit cds of an artist, where I feel there isn't a song missing. Usually in a music review, I'll highlight 3-4 of my favourite songs, but I have so many favourites here, I'll list them in order of top favourite. First, Self Control, Solitare, Ti Amo, Spanish Eddie, Shattered Glass, Gloria and the sexy Moonlight On Water.This is an amazing album that every fan of hers should own. Her voice is so powerful, she suited ballads mainly, but did great jobs on the faster songs. This is an album with 18 of her best songs and I hope everyone will enjoy it as much as I do."
4,Best Branigan Collection so far....,"This is the best branigan collection issued so far.All the hits and the fundamental album tracks (why silent partners instead of heart?!?!) are here and with the remastering they truly have a new life.Still, some songs are missing:for instance Maybe Tonight (from Hold Me) and Cry Wolf (from Touch) were both commercial singles and had videos and together with Hold Me and a couple of tracks from over my heart they deserved inclusion on the collection.But overall this is the best you get, until rhino will decide to put a 2 disc collection (maybe in their wonderful ""Gold"" series) with all the singles plus the new songs. Who knows...."
3,my daughter loves it.,"This was smaller than I expected, however it is high quality and very detailed. My daughter loves it but I still think it's rather pricey. However, because she likes it, I would buy it again."
2,Ehhh....... could be better.....,"Mark Lowry is the man, in my opinion. He is the biggest name in Christian comedy, and has been going for 25 years now (it says so on this album). He has always been a poster boy of hyperactivity, but I think that the age factor is starting to kick in, as well as the joining with the Gaither Vocal Band. This album demonstrates the decrease of comedy and the increase in mediocre music.I love Mark Lowry, and he is the only artist besides Newsboys on whom I will pay full price for an album. However, I like Mark Lowry for the comedy, not the music. If I wanted the music, I'd look somewhere else. He has a nice voice, but stick to what you know! The comedy on the album is decent, but there should be so much more! Oh well... maybe next time, Mark Lowry will realize that clean, Christian comedy is what we're looking for, since there's very little of it around. I came here for that, and I barely found it."
5,PLEASE put this on DVD,T'AI CHI CHIH is the easiest form of exercise I've found. My VHS tape is old. I'd love to get a DVD for my daughters who are in physical need of a good exercise program that I'm convinced would help them.A DVD would be easier for me to use too.Whoever is out there----help to get this SIMPLE and easy to follow form of T'ai chi for those interested in it. Carmen is the BEST!!thanx
1,cant touch A Night in SF,"Okay the only reason I am going to flunk this CD, its yes this is okay, is firstly, this CD cant touch A Night in SF double CD set, not in quality or sound. The real simple reason is its priceI have all of Vans CD's and have had them all for years, so looking for something different, and seeing this one listed for sometime at these prices all I kept thinking was man o man must be some killer show! its gotta be better or at least equal to the SF show CD, so I pulled the trigger and bought it.Its clear cut, not even close.So the reason I am writing this, the one and only bad Van review, is if you have the A Night in SF CD, save your money, if you want a good CD and don't have that one, again save your money and buy that one.So now you know, spend or not, you have been warned.IF you really rich and money is no object, well then maybe that's who these other reviewers are in here.poor me I guess, complaining on getting on getting by on 85k a year."
5,The best ever,This is the best album I've ever bought. It shows Van's talents and his ability to electrify any song! He does several covers from other artists that is awesome.The most talented singer I've ever witnessed on album and Live!
5,Next Best Thing to Being There,"I've always believed a live album should be fun. The songs have all been done before, after all. This album is not only great fun, it's a Van Morrison album you keep going back to. Hearing him bend ""I Just Wanna Make Love to You"" and ""Take Your Hand Outta My Pocket"" out of shape is a scream. He truly makes these songs his own. And of course, ""Gloria"" and ""Here Comes the Night"" are there too. It's like Morrison is showing off his record collection, and he loves it as much as I do mine. A superlative driving album."
5,Essential,"This is an essential album for any Van fan. Also, someone who is looking for an great introduction to Van would really enjoy this album. Listen and feel Vans emotion. The song arangements are top notch! I highly recommend this album to any music lover."
5,My cat loves it!,"Of my three cats, only one watches TV. I got tired of leaving the Weather Channel on for her, so I got this. She loves it. Her favorite is the laser bug. I swear the bug's buzzing noise is made by a teenage boy, which cracks me up, too. The bird cinematography is lovely. And I get a kick out of the Cats at Play section."
4,Cool Product! My cat totally watches it.,"My cat watches it and seems very amused. However, I think you need to have a cat that was already into watching TV. My cat already liked to watch movies and stuff. She likes this better than our movies but She only watches it sometimes. She's not quite as enthusiastic about it as the cats in the preview. So, I'd say if you know your cat watches TV and is fairly active, go for it. The loop feature is great! And if your cat is not that attentive, hey, at least it wasn't a very expensive cat purchase and it can't hurt. :)I really like the product."
3,Pretty good.,"Cats love certain parts of the video, it's funny for me to watch them! Some of it doesn't interest them but about 65% does."
3,Mystery,"I like Mary Roberts Rinehart a lot and have read many, many of her books and stories. Glad to be able to read this story, but found the reprint less than desirable. Doesn't seem professionally done, but I had not ever seen this story before and it was the only copy/format available. Will pass it on."
4,Great for factories but not for offices,"One point to note is that this is a heavy duty machine and every minute it generates quite a loud clicking sound as the wheels inside turn. While this noise is lost on a factory floor, it is totally unacceptable in an office. I liked the machine as a piece of equipment because the digital plastic Amano pix 55 we had before, gave out after a few years whereas this guy will last everything short of a nuclear holocaust. Furthermore they did give me a full refund which I much appreciate. This is the first time I have ever felt the need to review a product because had I read this review I would not have purchased and thereby saved the time and energy of setting it up and shipping it back and buying a replacement. So I ended up with another Amano and I guess I am condemned to buy another every few years or so."
4,Brush With Fate,"This was a very good movie, the only thing is, is that you have to watch it twice to really get an understanding on the sequence of where and to whom the painting was passed down. Those sequences can be a bit confusing if your not paying attention. Glenn Close gives a wonderful performance as the spinster Professor with a secret. The twist at the end of the movie took me by surprise. A very informative and educational film on one of the works of Vermeer and what could have possible happened to some of the greatest masterpieces we may never see. I highly recommend this movie to history buffs, art lovers and anyone who likes movies with a bit of a twist at the end."
2,"Beautiful Scenery, bad plot, bad acting",I bought this movie to see the Dutch scenery. I could barely get through the movie though and I'm too embarrassed to lend it to anyone. Glenn Close also did a poor job.
3,MOMS MUST EAT TOO,"A somewhat better than average entry in the genre, Flesh Easting Mothers is pretty much what you'd expect. The other review has gone into the details, and if this is your kind of off-the-wall bad movie, well_____check it out."
3,NOT SO WISE GUY,"Before taking on the role of the wiseguy in the acclaimed CBS series, Ken Wahl was making fluff movies like this 1987 corker. It is mildly entertaining, as it invokes memories of the cop series of the 70s and 80s. Wahl plays a journalist whose daughter is kidnapped by a terrorist group. He is joined by veteran character actor George DiCenzo in trying to get his daughter back. Doug McClure (Trampas on THE VIRGINIAN) plays a clueless cop on a diet, addicted to licorice sticks and spouting out bad euphemisms. There's not a lot of action in this movie, and what little there is, seems awkward and uninspired. The soundtrack itself sounds like a Tommy Mottola 70s record. Unoffensive if you're into this kind of thing."
1,No difference felt...,"been taking this for a month and a half with no positive results as of this posting, supplements are not necessary?"
1,CD does not have searchable electronic documentation,Inclusion of CD is misleading. It is copyprotected and of very little value. This is the first book I have seen which deceives a customer.
4,Excellent bag - but I went for bigger,"I had a Brenthaven Trek for my Mac, which is a great bag with lots of room, but it was uncomfortable to wear over the shoulder or full on. I wanted to change to a Messenger style bag, but was worried about not having enough space, so I ordered the Lowepro L for 17"" (even though I have a 15"")First of all, I was right to order a size larger, but the good news that this bag is excellent and really intelligently designed. Material quality is excellent, and the price is a tremendous value.The bag has more than enough room for all my stuff (and I have alot) and is extremely comfortable to wear. Genius moves are a padded downside, a spare handle, and sliding shoudler guard.My only complaint is that there should really be one more file-size divided compartment inside, but with the space I have at 17"" I just use the laptop sleeve."
4,summary book of engineering topic,historically an important book and quite strong in its simple and direct use of language and concepts. Read mostly for its clear description of engine balancing.
1,dont break it if it aint fixed,"I just recieved ZZ Top's ""Texas mud"" CD from amazon. What a bitter trajedy! This was one of the first L.P's i bought as a kid and when I put the disc on and pushed 'PLAY'I couldn't believe it! They have destroyed the original vibe with what they have done in the re-mix! It has lost the punctuation and sparse clarity I loved so much.All the mastery of pick attack and harmonic richness of Billy Gibbons guitar is now awash in a sea of DIGITAL DELAY, REVERB, and it sounds like PITCH MODULATION?WTF?? I put the vinyl on and there are definitely major sonic discrepancies. I feel as violated as the master tracks of the original recording. BEWARE THIS PRODUCT!!!!SINCERELY, C.N."
3,Spotty early effort,"Though it contains the great blues number ""Sure Got Cold After the Rain Fell,"" ZZ Top's second album, ""Rio Grande Mud,"" is a hit-or-miss affair. Some tracks like ""Just Got Paid"" and ""Francine"" stand out, but most of the material is fairly unexceptional. Not until the next record, ""Tres Hombres,"" would they really begin to hit their stride."
1,SAME OLD CRAP FROM WARNER BROTHERS !!,"This album, in it's original form (on LP) is great! The problem is the record company STILL hasn't reissued it without the ""Eliminator"" effects. This also pertains to their best album ever: ""First Album"". When they do finally come out (and they will), they will be issued first on LP to really gouge the fools and then on CD with some ""live bonus tracks"" that really suck, just like they did with ""Tres Hombres"". Too bad, because I used to be a HUGE fan back in the seventies. The band has totally blown their rep with me since all these re-issue games have started, beginning in the 80's with their ""Six Pack"". Shame on you rich dudes!!!!!!"
4,"The ""Top"" at there best!","ZZ Tops,Rio Grnde Mud is some of ther best stuff to date.Unfortuntly for those who heard the origanal album (vinly)youmay be a little disapointed, it's digitaly remastered wichmeans it sounds way over produced.The songs are the real deal,to Bad it's nasty blues sound is hidden in technology."
4,A classic,"I remember hearing this album on vinyl years ago and it was a fantastic collection of Texas boogie blues. However, many of ZZ Top's pre-Eliminator cd's were remastered in the early 1980's with electronic drum beats pasted over the top of Frank Beard's excellent original drumming, and many of Amazon reviewers have commented very harshly on this unnecessary meddling. Could anyone who owns Rio Grande Mud comment on whether this cd was similarly botched during the transfer to digital?"
1,What's the deal?,First off I don't understand why they even messed with the original kick-ass versions of their earlier albums and what is the hold up on remastering their entire back catalog? The vinyl versions are way better than the crappy sound on their first few cd's
5,ZZ Top Rio Grande Mud,"This was the first effort from those crazy guys from Texas. And I love them. This was totally raw rock, and Billy, Dusty and Frank do not let you down. From the very beginning, they will give you their best in rock and roll. I especially like ""Bar-B-Q"" and ""Chevrolet"". A must have for all the ZZ Top lovers."
4,ZZ Top's Best,"With Tres Hombres a close second, I regard Rio Grande Mud as ZZ Top's Best album. Three songs in particular elevate this album above the rest. 'Aplogies to Pearly' a funky little instrumental piece that showcases Billy Gibbons's excellent slide work. From there we fade right into 'Bar-B-Q', an up-tempo blues rock burner, with some fiery lead guitar passages. Third is the haunting 'Sure Got Cold After the Rain Fell', an absolutely mesmerizing slow blues number that swells in the final passages to great effect, on the heels of Billy's masterful guitar work. Throw in 'Just Got Paid', 'Ko Ko Blue', 'Whiskey'n Mama' and the rest, and you've got one of the classic blues-rock albums of all time. An album that solidified Billy Gibbons as one of the tastiest guitarists ever, and demonstrates the early fire and inventiveness of this young band, before their commercial blandness took over. If you're a ZZ Top Fan, this album is a must-have."
5,Best Relient K Album to Date!,"I've been a long time fan of Relient K and their fun, upbeat brand of punk rock music. For years, you could count of RK to bring some of the most absurd and hilarious topics to their songs (ie Sadie Hawkins Dance, In Love With the 80's (Pink Tux to the Prom)), and I was SHOCKED when I first listened to Mmmhmm. Between ""Mmmhmm"" and their last release, ""Two Lefts Don't Make a Right, But Three Do"", the boys have matured and brought a whole lot more depth to their song writing. The lyrics are solid, and musically, the disc is fantastic. It's totally what you'd expect from RK. Standout tracks include ""One I'm Waiting For"", ""I So Hate Consequences"", ""This Week the Trend"", ""Let It All Out"", and ""Which to Bury, Us or the Hatchet"". Watching RK evolve has been a lot of fun and ""Mmmhmm"" is an excellent addition to an already fantastic discography. If you get the chance, check them out at this year's Warped Tour. I hear they put on an awesome live show."
5,"emotion, devotion","This album blew me away. These guys put so much devotion into their work and this album is raw proof of that. As always, I was expecting a lot of random silliness that is Relient K's staple, but I think the maturity and emotion in Mmhmm's lyrics show how much the band has grown. There are definitely a lot more insinuations of their faith in this bunch of songs, which is awesome, but they still remain faithful to the fun, punky sound that everyone loves. I just want to say that this album is powerful, and that one of the songs even hit home so much that I cried. Please support these guys and go out and buy this CD because honestly, it's worth more than it costs."
3,Good but not great,"This album is good, but not great. I've been a RK fan since Tongue in Cheek, and this album was a little dissapointing. Not that there is anything particularly bad about any of the songs, but none of them are worth listening to over and over again like their last 3 albums. I got bored listening to it after maybe 5 times. A must have if you're a RK fan, and I hope they get back more to their roots on the next album."
4,Even Better?,"Can you say a religious version of The Used? Yes, fans of The Used will love songs like More Than Useless and Life After Death and Taxes, they both have an emo feel to them. But if you dont like emo, dont worry, the band keeps their style on most of the songs, but it is better song writting than before. If you havent bought this cd, buy it!!!"
5,Only the lyrics of my soul. :),"The lyrics to this CD are so deep. The CD is funny as usual, but reflects the growing maturity of the band (not that I don't love the immaturity of the band.) :)"
2,Sell Out,"Relient K's new cd mmHmm sucks. Sure the music is o.k. but the messages are gone. Those that listened to Relient when they were not the mainstream band and cornered a Christian audience know what i'm talking about. To me Relient K has sold out. Since this cd is made for a broader audience they don't proclaim their faith right out anymore. Also the energy in the older albums is gone replaced with a calmer, less exciting tone. The music, message, and band has changed... for the worse. I recommend not buying this cd and getting the older stuff. Mainly Two Lefts Don't Make a Right, and Tongue in Cheek."
2,unfortantly i like old relient k,this is bad news......relient k a once very respected christian rock band hit mainstream a sold outu must refrain from buying this cd and instead buy there old cd's wich are very good...............
1,bad,"im sorry but give me a break,These guys have lost it. there last cd is one of the best cd's i own seriusly. That song be my escape is weak i here that on my local popular music station then i browse through and i hear them on the christian station. and then i see them on channel one performing a concert.Make up your mind are you christian or not!"
1,"DONT LISTEN TO THESE 3 IDIOTS THAT MADE ""1 STAR""","OK ITS PPL LIKE THESE THAT MAKE ME ANGRY! ALL THESE ""3"" PEOPLE THAT DID THIS ARE JUST PLAIN STUPID!!!! if you want to read the real stuff go to the 81..i repeat....81 ""5-star"" reviews!...now as for these 3...shame on you! relient k got better and better..now at their best...its as an amazing almbum. the all-time favorite Relient K has now made good christian points and song that you can realte to....now plz go read the ""5-stars""by the way im 14"
1,preachy riff stealers,"if you voted for george w bush and/or think that relient k is the greatest band ever, you should definatly pick up ""mmhmm"". If you want a christain band that doesn't steal their riffs from blink 182 and/or preach jesus till' they're blue in the face, check out the late mXpX or hawk nelson. Utter crap, and a total waste of money. it pains me to see a band that steals riffs and melodies from other secular bands and still makes a profit. O stars. Oh and by the way, if you don't wanna take my word for it, check out the intro to blink's everytime i look for you (released in 01') and compare it to rk's chapstick intro. ITS EXACTLY THE SAME!!!!!!!"
5,New but loving it,I love this CD. It has all the meanings that a christain band offers and all the sound that a rock band offers. I heard the clips once and went out to buy the cd and for once shopping on impluse didnt backfire. Its worth it.
2,A dissapointment.,"Relient K was my absolute favorite band untill this CD came out. I owned everyone of thier EPs and CDs (with the exception of thier very first album which came out in 1998) This album seemed to have very little to say about God and they changed thier style of music. Relient K no longer sounds like the power punk band they once were. Now they just sound like radio rock. I strongly recomend thier older albums, but this one was a big dissapointment."
2,"Originality, the lack of it","ok, this album would be pretty decent if it had been their debut album and i knew nothing about relient k coming into listening to it... butt since i do... and since it isnt...i must give it a crap rating of 2 stars. Their guitarist knows a total of 4 chords. He uses them in a different order for each song he writes and when he runs out of different combinations he doesnt care and uses the SAME CHORD PROGRESSION twice on the same album. If that isnt bad enough, he doesnt even bother to change the melody or lead line that he plays throughout the intro. He may mix it up a little and change from acoustic to electric. Hopefully they will stop their downward spiral and their next album will be good again. Save us."
3,Expected more..,"This is an okay CD, but I truely was expecting more from it. It's songs basically sound the same, although they express different messages.There were only three tracks I truely liked, and there was no excitement with it."
4,good.. but,"Great cd, bar far their best cd to date, if you wanna call sell them sell-outs go ahead, but the cd is well done. However Bubbles please never again put relient K on the same level as green day not in lyrics, music, fame anything.... Green Day is the best punk band of all time, relient K wouldnt even crack the top 50 in any catorygory you want to place them outside of christian rock. So while i recomend this cd, don't think your getting a master piece just the same relient K this time without the jesus"
4,WHAT??,Where are all those of us who hated this band until now? Who can't hear the obvious change in this band? I personally could not stand the goofy lyrics and annoying pop punk crap that they tried to rip off of great bands like MxPx and did very badly. But with this new album its as if they are a different band all together. The musicianship and singing are way above previous efforts. I even attended one of their concerts in the past and was bored to tears. I bought this new album though and would even recommend them changing their name.
5,Just when you think they've done it all...,"i could never be more happy with this band...to think i used to not like them back in '99...i dont think there is a word that discribe the quality of this 14 track masterpiece in the lyrical and musical side. i think all other bands should bow down to Matt T., ive never more relating, nor moving lyrics ever, no one can compare to him, i could go on for hours about this band....just got by the cd at mardels...its 9.99, and i know you have 9.99, just go get it...and see the difference it will make in your life, it will make the biggest hater become the next christian, because it did that to me...peace"
4,Just a good CD...,"Its amazing how people give a band hell for changing it up a little. I mean, people are so picky now, that if one chord doesn't go to their liking, it's a horrible CD and not that band at all anymore.Relient K did just that, not only have they made better MUSIC, but have matured. Look at the likes of Blink 182, New Found Glory, Good Charlotte... all of which have changed their sound a tad... and *gasp* don't say it... have matured in playing and in song writing. Can't talk about high school days forever...All in all, Relient K's new album gets me into it, I would reccommend it to a friend, but not be head over heels for it, there are better albums out there."
5,Relient K - why cant you buy their albums in the uk?,i recently bought mhmmm along with the anatomy of tongue in cheek and two lefts dont make a right but 3 do from amazon.com. why could i not lay my hands on it anywhere in the uk? my friend introduced me to them one sunny afternoon in his car and ive been hooked ever since. with classic tunes that you can sing along to (many a time have i been heard singing no i dont hate you dont want to fight you.....) thanks amazon.com for providing me with a great album which was delivered quickly and which was way more affordable than english albums. cheers
2,Disappointing comeback?,"After listening to RK for years, I was excited to hear a new album had come out. But, listening to it, I was very disappointed. A new record label must mean a new sound. No longer did I hear the goofy songs I adored (such as Pink Tux to the Prom) but all seemed to have a more mellow, dark sound. The serious songs they used to have were the ballad type, and many were often almost worship songs. Now it is hard to tell whether or not it's God they're singing to. It seems their original sound has been lost, and now, being compared to The Starting Line, sound like a mix of every band that is out there."
5,Relient K has another GREAT hit!,"The boys from Relient K are at it again! After 3 already AMAZING albums they bring us ""Mmhmm,"" their latest (and most brilliant) cd. With tracks like ""More Than Useless"" and ""I So Hate Consequences"" they remind us yet again why we even buy cds at all. They bring in some old techniques and great sounding tunes just like on ""3 Lefts"" and ""Tongue in Cheek"" with some new sounding, even more thought provoking tunes and lyrics, and still manage to sound better than ever(of course!!!) It's a great followup to ""3 Lefts"" and they've outdone themselves this time!!! If you don't have any of RK's albums yet, WHAT ARE YOU WATIING FOR??? Mmhmm is DEFINITELY going to be a top-seller, and it's one of the best christian rock cds out there, so go pick up a copy today!!!"
5,RelientK at It's Best,"I have all four of the full length albums and I'd like to say this one was the best. I listen to it all the time. It's really the best christian pop-punk CD out there. Ibought this CD as soon as it came out and I love it. It has catchy lyrics that relate to everyday life and are fun to sing along with. Besides that, thes guys are really great and they have been bringing you top notch Christian punk since 1998. If you are reading this I hope your thinking about buying MMHHMM right now!! Compare it to Green Day and Bowling For Soup (who both use explicit lyrics) the style is the same but RelientK has a better messeage. I give this album 5 stars and 2 thumbs up!!"
5,Best Yet!!!,"OMG!! This is Relient Ks best CD yet. You should buy it, even if you didn't care for their other CDs. Because....well...it ROCKS!!!"
5,i luv u relient k!,"this cd is excellent! I didn't think that they could top ""Two Lefts..."" but some how they have. This cd is the perfect blend of punk rock to softer piano pieces. Its great seeing their music progress with every cd. Its amazing to see how much they love God. You definitely need to get this cd!"
5,Form someone looking for something a bit different,"As fan of lyrics, I am always looking for some one that gives me great listening music as well as well though out lyrics. I am tired of the mindless dance pop, rehash rap and life less profanity that seems to pass for music now a days. I have to admit when I heard of this group I though it would be like some of the awful Christian rock that exists out there(don't get me wrong I'm not against Christian rock, just badly written unimaginative lyrics). I was pleasantly surprised that Reliant K seem to have brought back some of the energy of the 80's punk style. With great puns sprinkled throughout the song that make you think and laugh when you get the meaning. They also, seem to take themselves a bit less serious that the average angst ridden band and seem to really enjoy what they do. If you want to rock out to some driving guitars and drum (with a few added instruments) in you car our home give this one a try, but make sure you read the lyrics."
4,"MMhMM, me likey!","In my opinion, this CD is not as good as ""The Anatomy Of The Tongue In Cheek,"" but then again, few pop-punk CD's are. This CD kind of moves them into more of emo/pop punk sound, which still really works for Relient K. Thiessen still has an excellent singing voice and he still writes witty songs with great wordplay. His balance of serious and funny songs reward the listener with a great overall CD. Some of my favorites are: The One I'm Waiting For, Be My Escape, I So Hate Consequences, Which To Bury Us Or The Hatchet, Let It All Out, and Who I Am Hates Who I've Been. The maturity on this album is showing that Relient K has a great future ahead of them, although punk rock isn't as big as used to be. So Relient K, who does not put out bad albums, should be a band to watch for in the next five years to see how much more they will develop and adapt."
3,Don't hate me relient K!,"First off in my review. I love relient K. I saw them at spirit song in Cincinnati this year and they were probably my favorite show to see. I love all their albums, including this one, even though my 3 stars may look like I hate it. Judging it next to other music, I'd probably give it a strong 4, but compared to the other albums, I had to go low. Though I did enjoy the maturation of themes, and the humor is still there. While it is another great Relient K disc, it is my least favorite, but that is still not a bad thing and I recommend it because Relient K rocks!!!!!"
3,"Good, Liked Most of it, but maybe a little too ""grown""","RelientK is just as smart-alecky as ever, but maybe too grown.The guitars aren't quite as wild and the music is just, in general, more melancholy than it used to be. I still like it, but would suggest their older albums instead. Especially ""Two left don't make a right, but three do"""
1,Like Crazy,This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen and the ending was absolutely horrible. What a waste of time.
1,Don't waste your time.,"I can't believe how awful this movie is...and what high ratings it got. These two kids are young, yes...and ill informed, and naive, and so on...but for crying out loud, grow up and make a freaking decision! They are together, then they aren't, then they are, then they get married, then split up, then get with other people again, then it ends. You don't even care about these characters at all! I want my $4 back."
1,Like Crazy - pitiful excuse for a movie,"Like Crazy is a slow moving, boring, and pathetic excuse for a movie. The story line, what little there was of it, meandered all over the place. Don't waste your money."
1,Worst movie ever,"This was the worst movie ever. Both characters cheat on each other, with no regard to anyone elses feelings. This is not a love story."
1,But is it art?,"First rule of impro (in movies): it never works. It was embarrassing, if compelling, when Godard tried it. Here it's merely excruciating. With Godard it was more cross-examination. You knew he was in control - and jolly uncomfortable (if electrifying) it felt. Here it's just two young people with nothing to say to each other and drink as default for the awkward gaps. How like life! (OK, in Godard they smoke.) An art movie for people who don't watch art movies"
1,Love and Selfishness Can Not Coexist!,"This is not a love story. It is a story of two selfish people who don't know what real love is. They put their own interest above the others. Most romantic movies ignore the fact that the feeling that comes with ""falling in love"", is not real love and is always temporary. In this movie it is clear from the tortured existence the characters choose to live, real love is something they have not yet been willing to give, and probably don't even understand. Even in the end it seems the only thing that brought them together was their selfish desires to regain that fleeting feeling that comes with falling in love, never learning how to truly love."
2,"Wait, what?","I spent a lot of time trying to figure out what was happening in this movie... You get the story in snippets, mostly without words. I was disconnected to the characters because I was left guessing a lot as to what they were thinking and feeling. I got the cheating part quite clearly, though. They were both unfaithful multiple times, even after they get married. They drag each other and two other people through the dirt, so it's no wonder they both struggle with trust issues the entire movie. The ending leaves you hanging. They get back together legally and supposedly permanently, so the distance issue is resolved, but they really don't appear happy. Perhaps because they realized the distance wasn't really the problem in their relationship... That being said, there was some good cinematography, so I give it some credit for that."
2,Disappointing Ending,I was really excited when i read the premise of this movie - i thought it would be a cute love story. While it had good parts i felt the movie as a whole was rather meh. The most frustrating part was the ending - it just ends without any resolution. Overall - not a bad movie to watch once but i won't go out of my way to watch it a second time.
1,"By the end of the movie, you dislike both of the main characters",They should have featured more Jennifer Lawrence! Her poor character get's tossed back and forth like last week's left overs.
1,Like Crazy Didn't Hold My Interest,I didn't finish this movie. I just found it to be a bit slow paced. You win some...you lose some.
2,Pretty bad,"Characters I couldn't care less about, weird filming, large bits of time missing, wtf moments and an incredibly strange ending equal one bad movie. So disappointed."
3,"Wanders a bit, but okay.","A young couple falls in love in college, but the woman is here on a student visa. She overstays her visa, and is later unable to return to be with him after attending her sister's wedding. Over the course of time, they grow apart and then come back together, always facing the dilemma of how they are going to make their relationship work. On the positive side, I appreciate the dilemma that the couple faces, deciding between others that they have connected with and getting back together. The negative of this film is that the natural course of events appears to be for them to grow apart, living on separate continents, and the movie just does not let it happen. Overall, the positive outweighs the negative enough to get a recommendation."
5,Classic Love Story,I saw this film when it first came out and have been wanting to get it on dvd ever since. It has easily become one of my top 5 favorite love stories.
1,HORRIBLE!!,"To sum it up... this movie starts out slow, then speeds up (almost too much), and then gets confusing and you cannot read what is going on with the actors because their expressions don't tell you! And the end of the movie... so bad that it actually kind of got me mad. It literally just STOPS. With no explination of what will come of the two.I was so excited to see this movie because all the reviews hyped it up to be this epic love story. NOT!! So so bad. The way the characters acted in it kept me confused. It was like having Kristin Stewart play every role because of all the stone faces and clueless looks and expressions. Don't waste your money on buying this. Im sure you will know some poor sucker who bought it and is willing to give it away!!!"
2,Was not impressed,Young people getting involved sexually. me Morals of the movie at an all time low. I'm a romantic at heart butimmorality of the whole thing. I would encourage others to NOT watch it.
5,Very Good!,"It was surprisingly a very good chick flick. Skeptical at first, but I definitely recommended it especially for couples in long distance relationships."
2,"No so crazy about ""Like Crazy""","I usually like movies that are different from the usual, text book love story, but this one wasn't my favorite. It was slow paced at times, the dialogue could have been a lot stronger especially between the two main characters. Their acting was fine, but there was definitely an element missing in this movie. If you're looking for a classic love story, then keep looking."
3,Like Crazy,This movie was OK. It was not one of my favorites. I don't think I would want to watch it again.
1,Terribly Stupid,"This movie has horrible and unbelievable dialogue, bad music, and is not captivating in any way. I'm sorry I wasted my money."
2,I was expecting it to be way better,So disappointed! I was really looking forward to watching this movie and couldn't wait for it to be over. Boring!
5,Great Multi purpose TV and Entertainment Center,"This was our first large TV set. We chose the digital projection technology because you get the picture of projection without the occasional exploding bulbs you get in the other projection units.The TV lives up to hype, as when we first plugged it in to Cable without even the Cable box, it found all the channels and we could see a lot of HD content readily available.The unit starts quickly, changes channels quickly, and has great color. It does a pretty good job of upsampling low resolution channels and input.We are very pleased with this TV, and the technology level, the HDMI is version 1.3 which will give you some better throughput with some equipment, and also future proof your purchase a bit.We also have hooked up a Playstation 3 to it, and it just works great!"
3,Problems after a year,"I love my TV, however just after a year it will not come on, So much for it lasting the 100,000 hours or life of the TV. Not to mention it could cost $300-$900 depending on what the problem is. I get 3 blinking lights which in Samsung's meaning, is that the ""bulb"" is bad. A TV technician said it could probably be the power supply since they are built with cheap junk. And that he has had several to work on recently. Samsung was no help since I'm outside of the year warranty, so I told them thanks for selling me a $2400 TV that dies right after the warranty. But I loved the picture and quality of the TV which went well with my Samsung home theater system."
3,Ok set. Needs work,"Got this set about a month ago. Noticed the ""prism"" effect since day one. This is where you get rainbow type flashes and flickers within the objects on the screen. This issue is more prevalent when watching DVD than anything else but I have started to notice it more while watching television as well.Have had a tech come out and she noticed the issue and told me to wait for firmware. At this time Samsung has no known firmware that will fix this issue. So I'm working on exchanging this set through Vanns.com. Vanns has a return policy where they come and pick up your defective set and then ship you out a new one, leaving you withough a $2k+ product that you have already paid for for more than a week.Good times."
2,The Complete Guide for CPP Exam Preparation,"I have to say that I am somewhat disappointed in the book. I also purchased the Amazon recommended book to go with this, the CPP examination. I went with the CPP book due to the fact that ASIS CPP publications start at $500 and go to $1,000 for books to help with the exam.In reviewing sample tests for the exam, there are questions in highly important areas of key domains and information that are not covered at all in the CPP book. I was looking for an all-in-one guide with the quality of a Shon Harris CISSP publication, but this book is very lacking in that regard. If you are the type of person that would rate Shon Harris books an ""A"", this book would be a ""C""."
1,"A handbook for the 'Kick me I*m a tourist"" crowd","With the name Frommer, I really expected something substantial. I cant tell you how disappointed I was when I got this. It is a mere shadow of the ÒMoon Montana HandbookÓ, and only a pamphlet of highlights compared to the ÒUltimate Montana Atlas and Travel EncyclopediaÓ. They try to funnel you in to the high traffic tourist spots, and only suggest the pricey restaurants and motels. About the only good thing I can say about it is that its a quick read. They cram all of Montana into a little more than 200 small pages. If you really want to explore Montana, get the ÒUltimateÓ or the ÒMoonÓ books (the ÒUltimateÓ book is really the only one youll ever need). If you are part of the ÒKick me, Im a touristÓ crowd, then by all means buy this book."
5,This one's a winner!,"This author continues to mature with each new book. Tragic Wand is even better than Tucker's two previous Merlin books. This whodunnit had me on the edge of my seat until the very last moment. Fearing for the safety of the two protagonists, I found myself reading late into the night. Tucker's descriptions are terrifyingly real. I know this sounds a bit trite, but this is truly a medical thriller you cannot put down. Prepare to be sleep-deprived!"
1,Just how dumb does author James Tucker think we are?,"I guess James Tucker thinks the reading audience needs a little help keeping the characters straight. He named the surgeon ""Dr. Cutter"", the doctor who is also a magician is ""Merlin"", and the detective is ""Deringer.""And if you think the names are demeaning to your intelligence, try some of the ""plot"" twists. The young (and, of course, beautiful assistant D.A. who is also Merlin's live-in lover) is so worried that the mole on the back of her neck (near her hairline) might be cancerous, that she elects to visit the area's premier plastic surgeon to have it removed. She doesn't see a dermatologist, not an oncologist, not even a general practioner, but a PLASTIC SURGEON? Where is the logic in this book?I'm half way through the book and am wondering if there is a better use of my time. Perhaps tweezing spare hairs from my eyebrows? Counting the bathroom tile? Building the Pyramids of Eygpt out of sugar cubes?"
4,Good album for memories,Nice to hear the boy's again. The quality is good which is not always true with 'old' albums.
1,Recording Quality Really Poor,I could have recorded old records and tapes with better quality than these tracks. I suggest finding the songs you want on other discs.
3,Some folk tunes still rock,"This is not a bad album for folk music fans. This compilation showcases the group's unique harmony with some of their standards--just couldn't believe they didn't include ""sloop john b"" though."
3,good old songs,I leave in France and I've bought this record after i heard it in a movie. Three songs have been translated in france and are well known. Good time with the good old time.
3,Greatest Hits?,"I purchased this CD and discovered that ""Scotch & Soda "" was not included. Songs that were not hits were included. My fault for not checking. Be sure to recognise that it is their hits not necessarily yours. As far a recording quality the CD is fine."
5,pleasant and fun to sing along with,"Brings back memories of the past. I enjoyed especially ""Where have all the flowers gone"""
2,Kingston Trio,Listening to this cd took me back to my growing-up years. I remembered all their songs I loved back then. It's a great homecoming.
5,old is good,I love folk music and especially Kingston Trio. They bring back alot of memories. This is the secon one in last 3 months. Thank-you for having such a varied library.
1,Don't buy this album,"I picked this album up thinking that it would go well with my collection of other latin music. This album is terrible. It is like they got the worst version of every song and put in on a disc. Songs like Amor are off-key, and they don't have the bounce and flow that is common for most latin music. Don't waste your money on this album."
4,Good documentary,"Interesting documentary about the life and career of the master of 20th century macabre fiction, H. P. Lovecraft. Lovecraft was perhaps the most influential and imitated (and ridiculed) horror author of the past hundred years, and continues to be a major stylistic influence 75 years after his death.The film is part biography and part literary criticism. Writers, filmmakers and scholars like Ramsey Campbell, Peter Straub and John Carpenter are on hand to discuss Lovecraft's influence on their own lives and work."
5,"Tentacles, Claws, And Eyeballs...","LOVECRAFT: FEAR OF THE UNKNOWN is a thorough, fascinating documentary about the life, interests, and influences of legendary horror writer, H.P. Lovecraft. Interviews w/ modern horror writers and directors such as Peter Straub, Ramsey Campbell, John Carpenter, Stuart Gordon, and Guillermo del Toro make for a near-giddy Lovecraft love-fest! I found this to be both insightful and entertaining. If you are a Lovecraft fan, then put on your CTHULHU slippers and watch this baby tonight!..."
5,Lovecraft In Detail,"An excellent review of HPLs life provided by a knowledgeable cast of characters. The extra scenes, discussing many of his stoires, are worth the price of purchase alone. This is a must for any serious Lovecraft fan."
5,"Detailed, well balanced, well written.","This is quite a long book that gives a detailed exposition of the events of the initial 21 or so cases at Nuremberg. Taylor participated at a high level. He is a distinguished author and scholar.This covers not only description of the cases, but gives insights into all the main personalities present, including Goering and Jackson. It is written nearly 50 years after the event, so interesting information on what happened in the years afterward is given as well.Taylor writes well, gives his own opinions in a balanced way and does not back off from sensative issues. And they don't come much more sensative than this.Strongly recommended."
1,Not what the picture shows!,"I did get a Boston Bruins plate frame, but it has a tiny bruin logo in the bottom middle portion. I was disappointed, but it was a gift and I would not have had time to return etc."
4,Garage Sale Surprise,I picked up this book at a garage sale recently. Although it is an unauthorized biography it gave me a good glimpse of Paul Allen's life. Fascinating just doesn't describe it. A worthy read into the journey of a man who has affected our existence.
1,Reads like a 7th grade book report,"I was excited about the topic, as there should be much to say about Paul Allen. Unfortunately, this book reads like little more than a compendium of other sources with the author's mildly informed barbs along the way. Ms. Rich seems to love to judge Mr. Allen's successes and failures, but you learn little about the man in the process. You're better off reading the Forbes or Fortune archives about the man. Furthermore, the book is poorly structured and redundant, giving you the same information multiple times. It reminded me of hastly done 7th grade book reports, where you repeated information just to make the minimum length of the report. Perhaps Ms. Rich was doing the same to reach the 200 page requirement for the book..."
5,If you love old school than this is for you,"Personaly i was getting sick of the same 3d shooters all the time and wanted to try something else, As a fan of old school games, the second I saw this I got it. When it came I was not dissapointed, the game was in good condition and the gameplay is awsome."
4,Michael Karole - 'Deluge' (Mute),"Looks to be the late Can guitarist's only solo effort. Not sure as to describe 'Deluge' as Avant Garde or perhaps New Age. Either way, it's a change of pace for Karoli, I'm sure. Saw that three songs here were co-written with Can drummer Jaki Liebezeit. Tunes I dug the most were ""You're The Driver"", ""Home Truths"" and the dream-like ""The Lake"". Personnel is strictly a duo, Polly Eltes-vocals and Karoli-guitar, bass, harmonica, violin, keyboards, sax and percussion. A nice little oddity for your listening pleasure from the folks at Mute."
3,A little disappointment...,"Can's guitarist's lone solo work is akin to world music style, Michael plays nearly all instrument, and cooperate with singer polly eltes. Om... it captures the late Can world music spirit, and Eltes sings the stream of consciousness lyrics in a strange way... I find the sounds quite polished, yet it do not captured the heyday Can's creativity and originality. The stuff are quite forgettable... for better solo Can efforts, try Irmin Scmidt's dreamy ""Anthology""... this guy's solo work have his own distinct style. More clined to classical music."
5,"Move over Grafton, Mott Davidson and Evonovich","Make room, Sue Grafton, Diane Mott Davidson, and Janet Evonovich! The first novel by author Susanne Severeid is a page turner, guaranteed! It's so much fun to read a new author, love their book, and then wait impatiently for the next one. Ms Severeid's Trix Donovan embodies qualities we all hope we have; fear but courage to pursue things that matter to us. I like her. She'd be the kind of friend I'd like to have."
1,Why Bother?,"This film is dreadful. How did they get Yancy Butler to agree to his? The direction is so transparent that I was embarassed. The lead male is just unreal but then I understood that he wrote it as well so there you have it. I never really decided what it wanted to be..scary..romantic, who knows. A better question is who put up the $ cause I've got some swamp land in the Sahara I'd like to sell them. The only bright spot was some mild intrigue created at various points in the early going.Viewers stay clear."
4,marigold cookbook opinion,The cookbook was as advertised and it is a wonderful vintage cookbook on southern cooking. I would encourage anyone to add it to their collection. The recipes are intriguing and would be easy to do today as well as something out of the ordinary.
2,Voodoo,"Millionaire Kester Weidmann believes money can buy everything - even life and death. So when his brother dies, Weidmann seeks the services of a voodoo expert to bring him back to life. He finds Rollo, a crooked nightclub owner who seizes the opportunity for the biggest con of the century. But Rollo had not reckoned for the involvement of Celie, his exotic mistress, and Butch, the nightclub's bouncer. And he had certainly not reckoned they would decide the Weidmann fortune was more important than his own neck...."
3,Guilty pleasure from outta nowhere....,"...I remember getting this back in the ninties and knowing nothing about other than I thought it was a tight production and smooth Latino vocals. Well, time has past and still I think this release isn't bad because it reminds me a little like Gang Star 's ""Hard To Earn"" (although that's a straight classic) because the lyrics are bent on hard times instead of ""pow"" ""pow"" ""pow"".I don't believe its in print still. Check for it in the cut out / bargin bins were stuff like this is found. That way if you don't like it, you won't feel to bad."
3,I've used this product before. I like that ...,"I've used this product before. I like that it doesn't damage my already damaged hair. It's a very gentle and mild hairspray. The scent is also very nice. It's probably the best smelling hair spray on the market. On the negative side, however, the spray tends to come out heavy and unevenly. The nozzle also gets clogged easily, which is annoying. I also have to say that I love the company that makes this hair spray and I use their shampoos and conditioners exclusively. The fact that they don't do any animal testing makes me even more loyal to them. I would recommend this product to friends, but perhaps warn them about the problem with the nozzle. I might recommend an aerosol made by the same company to people who this would be a problem for."
5,BETTER THAN ANYTHING ELSE,These guys are better than anybody in the world. No joke. Buy the album today. You will enjoy it for the rest of your life.
5,amazing,You HAVE to try this if your issue is enlarged pores. I have seen a reduction in pore size so much that my make up goes on smoother. I also rub the excess left on the pad on my arms and the brown spots are lighter. i am ordering more. thx amazon for this connection.
2,Added ingredients caused breakouts...,"I have used Alpha Hydrox for about a year now. I have seen great results with Glycolic-AHA, so I thought these wipes would be the next best step before attempting a stronger peel. Unfortunately, one of the added ingredients (I think it may be the witch hazel) broke me out with small white bumps.I used them for about a week and other than the adverse reaction, I did not see any other results. I am going back to the brand I know works and does well with my sensitive skin."
4,Great Results,These treatment pads work really well on my skin. My skin isn't super dry after using them. I apply moisturizer after using them and have noticed an improvement in my skin texture.
2,Too greasy.,"First, the item arrived with a crack in the jar and had leaked all over. To my surprise the pads inside the jar were still wet enough to use so I tried it. It leaves my skin feeling greasy, which I don't care for. I think 20% is a great place to start if you've never used glycolic acid before, or if you want to add it to your daily routine. I will not reorder these. I will look for another brand at 20% for daily use."
3,Cup holders,"THis review is not a reflection on the seller, but these did not fit the holes in my boat. They are as described, they just didn't work as I had hoped."
4,Smithsonian Native American Photography,I got the book for my husband per his request and as usually after so many days or weeks he decides he does not want it anymore but wants something different and back and forth we go. He drives me up a wall. I did see a few pictures and I thought they were nice pictures.
3,Only When Required,"At $100.00 this book demonstrated what it really means to be gifted: get your average textbook to be required in education courses needed by public school teachers and charge as much as you can for it. No way should this book cost what it does. It is not bad, but the price is ridiculous. Enough said."
3,Good design with lousy fan,"I bought this to replace the fanless heatsink on my motherboard chipset which was getting a bit too hot for my tastes. The product worked pretty well at cooling the chipset, but the fan developed a nasty squeal after only a few months of operation. Around this time I also noticed a drop in system stability, presumably due to the fact that the chipset was overheating. The problem with fans this small is that the bearings tend to wear out pretty quickly.I didn't bother trying to get it replaced under warranty because the hassle and cost isn't really worth it to me, so I just replaced it with a different heatsink that uses a much larger fan. I actually ended up not using a fan on the new heatsink and I haven't had any problems yet."
2,Gift Item,"I cannot truly rate this product as I have sent it as a gift for my father-in-law. He has not received it yet, but he is excited and looking forward to trying it out. It is similar to another magazine he used to get and he is always re-reading the old magazines over and over. I hope he will enjoy the new stories."
4,Lots of good information,"I learned alot from reading this book. It's fairly short, and has lots of interesting tidbits. Though I feel it should be renamed--it doesn't deal with most indian cultures, but rather the Chippewa Indians, as they are who Frances Densmore made an extensive study of. The title is a bit misleading. One thing I felt that would have improved the book would have been a bit more of a clear listing of the information in the book, but then again, it is rather dated material."
3,wild plant medicine,book isn't what i expected. no pictures or detail of plants or how to realy gather or properly use them or amounts to use.
1,True Blue,"This book is too violent for young children or beginning readers. Just a few examples -- A girl's family is threatened by poachers, her dog is lost, another dog is shot -- Pass."
5,This book is awesome!!!,I started reading this book after I put my children to bed and didn't get to bed until about 2 a.m. because I just couldn't put it down. I couldn't wait to go from chapter to chapter. I finished this book in one night. This is easily one of the best books I have ever read.
2,patterns run small,"I made the soft wrap jacket that is pictured on the front.. I had to alter the pattern because even though I made the biggest size, it was too small.. Like it didn't fit my 105 lb husband.. It is very easy to knit and looks nice but the size was tiny! Even the sleeves were 4 in too short and I'm only 5'9"" so I can imagine the problems anyone taller than me had. Wish I would have known before I started just how much I would have to change with the pattern because I would have just used a different one..A plus side is that there are a bunch of adorable items to knit for a baby. I wouldn't touch another maternity pattern out of this book though."
4,Very pretty knits!,"I have already knitted two pieces from this book and it has some really beautiful knits in there, the only thing I would have added as well is a higher age group for the children, most knits end at age 9 months so if you want to knit some of these beautiful pieces in a larger size, you would have to calculate yourself how many stitches and inches to add to each piece, which I am planning to do, as some clothes are just too cute to wear only for a few months.I am not planning to knit anything from the mothers section, even though it does have some really nice pieces, but I am too far along already and I never purchase or make something for the pregnancy itself (besides a couple of pants maybe), as I personally think it is a bit of a waste to get rid of the stuff after only nine months."
3,simple and sweet,This book has some simple and sweet patterns in it for mom and baby. I bought it for the quick simple baby sweaters done in bulky yarn.
4,great patterns and ideas,"i've been looking for this book, for some time. shame on me for not thinking of amazon.i've already made two patterns and i'm loving it. easy to follow instructions for beautiful items. with so many pregnant women around me, this book will definitely get some use!!"
5,A different view of the people with this desise,"The format for this book is what makes it different for me from so many others. You get their important story, but you also get a more human view of them through the pictures which really do a great job of making thier story all the more real. I also think this view of how these people are living thier lives might help people get by some of the fear they might have which comes from not understanding this desise. Just like so many other ailments, you can learn to live your life with it, and the way these people do that is inspiring.... I recommend this for the portriats alone, but surely for the good it will also do it spreading awareness of this desise and the great people who deal with it daily."
1,Thought It was a woman singing,"I listened to this and was not overly impressed, just standard pop, polished, manufactured music, but then I saw that it was a man singing the songs.....well at least looks like a man sort off at present time anyway. Better than the garbage on the radio these days as anything is, but still just standard medicore pop."
2,Remastered CD sound horrible.,This cd is a reproduction and remastered in Korea. Modern talking is the best but the remixing were done so bad I only listen to cd twice than shelf it go.
3,Limitted Information,"This is a nice book to augment a collection, but is not complete. The set of guides written by Smith and his daughter (Weber) do not overlap. This means that you need this book and the edition for the south in order to look up mushrooms in the south. There are no mentions of spore print colors in the individual entries, which makes for a lot of thumbing back and forth between the specific entries and the genus descriptions"
2,book,"ordered book, got book, little info. didn't realize it was copyright 1958 and an old library book, that was thrown out (I hope) because of it's age. buyer beware."
5,Behind the Front Line is FUNNY!!!,"I found out about this book from a co-worker, I work for the Post Office, he told me that it is really funny just knowing what happens to the window clerks at the post office. After reading it, I couldn't believe that these stories are all true. After talking to the clerks in my office, I found uot that these things really happen. Try it out and read it for yourself, this book is really funny and hillarious, worth the price for a little bit of humor..."
3,Dane Spotts Review...,"It was said on the CD to do 4-5 sessions per week. I will be doing 5 per day. I will be posting along the way.I Have Done Extensive Study on Neuro-Associative Conditioning, Neuro-Linguistic Programming, Rational Emotive Therapy, Personal & Leadership Development, Psychology of Achievement, The Power of Purpose, The Art of Fulfillment, Accelerated Learning Techniques."
4,A Stepping Stone,"Very good book here, covers the basics in most areas of mind expansion that I can think of. Excellent use of motivational psychology and philosophy. The Super Intelligence track on the CD is useful as well for a relaxing sound bath, but make sure you set your CD player to repeat this track or you will be blasted from your bliss by the horrific Mozart Brain Boost track that follows, as it seems about a million times the volume and like a ton of dynamite going off under your pillow. All in all this book and CD is well worth the time and money as a stepping stone to greater things on your journey to higher consciousness."
1,false and misleading,"The soundtrack on this cd may affect your mental health. I've listen to it for 30 days as the author suggested and I experienced loss of memory, concentration and increased mental fog. And more: the book itself is a waste of time. The author claim to have created the light and sound machine during a vision he had years ago, when these devices were created back in 1950 by well know scientists. The author is very strange and I believe he has hidden intentions to achieve behind these soundtracks."
5,"If you own a brain, you need this book and CD!","When I bought Dane's Zygon machine long ago, I thought it couldn't get any better. It just did! Now, we don't need cumbersome light/sound machines, Superintelligence CDs go beyond what those devices were able to do. I'm eagerly awaiting more CDs with this superb technology. You have ro READ the book. You have to LISTEN to the CDs. If not, nothing much will happen. If so, gradual, beautiful changes come about in all aspects of life. Could it get any better? If it can, Dane Spotts will be the person to make it available to us, I suspect.I have had the book for six months, it is priceless to me. A bargain at many times the list price!"
4,trustworthy time-release,"I learned from people interested in naturopathy that Jarrow is a brand to be trusted for purity and potency. I have been using their sustain formula by taking one with plenty of water every night a few hours after my last meal, and one every morning before I make my breakfast. I take it for its antioxidant strength. I understand that amino acids like NAC work much better when taken on an empty stomach. I like the idea of taking a time-release form because NAC has such a short half-life. This tablet isn't the easiest to swallow: it has an unpleasant taste and sharper edges than a capsule, but at least it is shaped like a capsule instead of being circular."
2,Did not help with Tinitus.,"My ear doctor told me this stuff might help stop the ringing in my ears so I gave it a shot. After taking it twice a day for a month, it doesn't seem to have helped much at all."
3,Who would put up with that?,"Well, maybe if your name is Hillary! I liked the book because a story was being told as opposed to unfolding. It was a nice change. I also thought that reactions of the affairs was also a topic that was explored well."
1,The good soldier,"I know that I will outrage alot of people with this review but here goes... This is one of only 2 books that I have ever read that I truly REGRET devoting the time to , but once I start a book I always finish.I don't know what else to say except that it was painful for me to finish this. I just don't get it. The main character was quite annoying to me and the story was SO SLOW and predictable I really just wanted it to end. I would not recommend this book for fun and if it is required reading for you I am sorry."
5,The most perfectly structured novel ever written,"The Good Soldier has all the tension and fragility of aballoon filled with twice the amount of air it's supposedto hold. It is a howling, subversive, gut-bustingly funnypiece of bathroom graffiti masquerading as a quaint book ofmanners. Do yourself a favor and read it immediately!"
3,"Marriage, fidely and propriety","This is definitely not a book of our (modern) times. It is a book of its own time. Neverthelless, it does explore marriage and morality of ""keeping up appearances"". Although I do not find it personally to be the saddest story ever, some of the character descriptions and psychology of them is brilliantly explored in the last pages of the book. It is a great reflection of the times passed and endurances of many marriages caused by both internal and external struggles of people in them. It was a thrill to be transformed in the era of 150 years ago and see that complexities of marriage are not just issues of modern times. Marriages are made of complexities, no matter what time or era it involves."
3,"interesting arrangement, but boring","i liked the way that details are revealed in this book: you think you've got the story pretty much down, then 50 pages later the narrator gives you a little more insight. it comes in little unexpected burst like--oh yes, did i tell you that so-and-so was a paraplegic? no, no, i suppose i left that out somehow.also, the little garden paths he walks you down for pages before bringing you back into the story are genuinely fun (and funny) and the character development is even more than that--the narrator paints a picture of a wretched man, then changes his mind and repaints him as harmless, almost a victim...but overall this book requires too much diligence for a relatively small number of pages.oh yes, did i tell you it took me six years to get past the first 12 pages? no, no, i suppose i left that out somehow.(no joke)"
2,The Good Soldier? In what respect?,"I enjoyed this book to a certain extent, but I found some aspects of it troubling and annoying. It was difficult for me to stomach the portrayal of Americans. The book is thoroughly English in every respect, and I thought his writing of American characters betrayed a fundamental misunderstanding of America. It's not that he's stereotyping Americans; it's more like he's never met one before. The story itself was riveting, but the narrative style, while it may be fascinating in a literary criticism class, was more of a liability than an asset to me as a reader. I also would have liked to develop my own empathy or distaste for these characters, but instead, I was continually reminded by the narrator how noble all these pathetic people were supposed to be. It disappointed me. If that makes me a literary cretin, so be it."
3,An Ironic Tale,"Although this is a classic, I found it to be a hard read. I did not like any of the characters. I found the style intriguing, though convoluted. The narrator admits to telling the story in ""a very rambling way."" He explains, ""One remembers points that one has forgotten and one explains them all the more minutely since one recognizes that one has forgotten to mention them in their proper places . . . ."" It is a tale of irony, in which nobody gets what they want: ""The things were all there to content everybody; yet everybody has the wrong thing. Perhaps you can make head or tail of it; it is beyond me."" It is beyond me, too. Nevertheless, I am glad that I read it."
3,A painful narrative of deception and intrigue,"Ford has written a clever, painful to read, novel. The narrator describes how he and his wife Florence met another couple they were so compatible with that they spent the next 9 years together. After you are fully convinced that they are all wonderful, you learn that one of them is not at all what he seemed but far more sinister, but that is only from one character's point of view. You then learn It may be that another character is really to blame for the behavior of the first, and so on. As soon as you think you know the characters, they are cast in a new light. At the end, you are not even sure you know the narrator, except that he is shallow and self-deceived. The novel is well written but the characters aren't necessarily believable -- except that you are seeing them through the narrator's eyes and he may be self-deceived."
5,The Greatest Modernist Work,"It is essentially a simple story, but it is done so creatively through the use of a non-linear story line and multiple perspectives that it becomes a complex analysis of human thought and social behavior. FMF may be the most underrated craftsman of the century. His work and impact on fellow writers, especially Rhys, make him one of the most important figures of the twentieth century. The Good Soldier is an amazing achievement."
1,Give me a break,"This has got to be one of the dumbest movies of the year. I bought this movie for my kids because they had found the site somehow and I thought it would be cool seeing what hasbeen actors have been up to, but I really was genuinely disappointed. I just ended up returning it. For some reason, the entire movie was this big chase scene which was really irritating. Maybe you could make this stuff in the 1950s but not nowadays - children are smarter than this. Don't risk it. Get the Apple Dumpling gang."
4,"Reminds me of ""Swing Out Sister""","I think this is a wonderful album. Her style and voice kind of remind me of the British group, Swing Out Sister. If you like Ria, I would defintiely recommend picking up some of their music as well. Ria has a soulful sultry sound that is mellow. I love listening to this cd when I am driving. I recommend u get it."
5,Wonderful Book,Anything from the Bible is great. This book puts quotations in the order you are looking for them. They are easy to find and so helpful in times of need...
5,Everything you know is wrong.,"Evan Orgell thought he was ready for everything, but he was not ready for a world where everything was new and unknown. From the beginning Foster draws you into the story with his rich detailed descriptions of a place that you can only imagine. You will find yourself turning page after page impatient to learn more about this beautiful but deadly place."
5,Fantastic!,I found this book in my dad's books that he handed down and its long been one of my favorites. A lot of unique ideas and brilliant storytelling. I'd highly recommend it.
4,Fantastic SF,"I love it when a writer creates a whole new world. This has been one of my favorite books forever, and just had the opportunity to read it again. The crystal based lifeforms, and they way our hero navigates a planet after his armor-plated robot come bodyguard is destroyed is fantastic. Wish there was more like it."
3,It's O.K.,"A basic knowledge of reading simple standard music notation is required in order to follow the explanations and illustrations. Unfortunately, even when playing by ear, the author has to use some means to explain chords and musical information. A person who has no idea what a piano keyboard is, nor how to read simple music notation will find this book hard going.That said, the book does contain useful information concerning playng piano by ear. The lists of 1-chord, 2-chord, 3-chord, and 4-chord songs are useful for a beginner. The explanations of Alternating Bass, chord inversions, modulation, and Bass Runs are certainly useful.While some illustrations and explanations are not as clear as they could be, in figuring out what is meant, you learn better than if it had been stated clearly enough that no effort was required to understand."
4,nice cd,"Nice album debut cd-reissue from one of the better groups in the early 80's. A lover's holiday & glow of love are the best songs,essential stuff !. Strong vocals from Luther Vandross & Jocelyn Brown. Let's hope that one day the albums from the BB&Q; Band (same production team) also will be re-issued on cd!!!!!!!."
5,Very Soulful,This Disc is very Soulful and Luther Vandross is in strong form on this disc.This Disc Grooves&is smooth all at once.
3,Solid - but not what I was expecting,"I ordered this brand because we have a nice one at work (I think it is the $300 version). I ordered this one specifically because I thought the medium gray would look nice on my wall. Pros - it is solid and I am sure it will work well for me as a bulletin board. It also appears to be what you get for the money. Cons - it doesn't match the picture - the face is a light beige (not gray to my eyes) and the board I received has a vertical end-of-the-fabric-bolt mark running vertically down it - you wouldn't think they would be proud to send that out the door. It will work, but it isn't going to look as nice as I had hoped on my wall."
5,best book ever!,This was like the coolest book of all time!Its about these two brothers and there friendwhom go on A adventure to save there friend and travel through the dark scary dungons of doom.its very entertaning and theres not A lot of romance.Who ever draws the pictures on the cover is verytalented.I also reccomend w.i.t.c.h
3,"OK, but not great.","Read this one with my kids. Slow and dry in parts. Being a long time D&D player, I had higher hopes. I wanted my kids to see the fun of RPGs and the varied world that comes with it...alas, this book barely kept them interestd."
4,Not easy listening,"Another one of my whim buys. REally I think its a three and a half, but thats been awkward. Parts of it I think are great, Big Science, Seaters (anyone who has come to an end of a relationship will empathise) and Let X=X. They are quirky with a supportive backing music. All through I feel the music is simply the back drop to a poetry session. That is not a criticism, but an observation. Other parts seem to degenerate into wall paper like From the Air. To summarise, yes I am glad I own this music, but it never really encouraged me to buy anything else by Laurie Anderson."
1,Warranty,"Please be aware that Briggs and Stratton's warranty is a joke. This applies to all their products. I had a brand new mower engine blow up on me (literally) after only a couple hours of use and putting oil in it as per the manual. B&S calls it a maintenance issue and washed their hands of me leaving me out the money on the mower, the money to have someone look at it after it blew up and money to ship the mower to them. Their customer (no)service doesn't even bother calling me back to talk about the problem."
1,Lame,"Wasn't exactly what I'd call a ""so bad it's good"" type of film; just bad all around. Awful production values, worse acting, and lazy writing. The ending isn't as shocking as the synopsis and reviews would have you think. Ever see ""The Vanishing""? Remember how bogus the ending of that was after all the hype? That's about the size of it."
