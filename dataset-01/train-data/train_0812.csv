1,Ugh.,"I don't profess to have any kind of skills as a critic. But I do read a lot. And I know what I like. This, I do not like. The characters are boring and flat. The book is preachy. I didn't need a whole chapter dedicated to the stigma Rowan faces as a witch, especially when the chapter was all repitition of facts we all ready knew. I'm really sorry I bought this book!"
4,Mixed feelings,"First off let me say I enjoyed the book and would look forward to more from the author. My initial joy over finding a novel with a somewhat realistic pagan portrayal lost some of its joy when the stereotypical responses by his native american detective drew my attention away from the good. I had to consciously remind myself not to let the poor portrayal of NAs deter from a good pagan mystery. I think the author needs to research the historical connotations of such term as squaw and Tonto and realize to many NAs these are negative connotations, not to be used as lightly as demonstrated in this book. From a pagan perspective I enjoyed the book, from a mystery point it seemed a little weak, but overall an enjoyable read."
5,"An original, addictive series!","Sellars has definitely filled a void with this UF series. The characters are multi-dimensional and have great depth, especially as the series unfolds. I actually care about them, heck, I wanna hang out with them! Action, comedy, drama and suspense are woven together masterfully with a Pagan thread. Proof that 'paranormal' thrillers don't have to include vamps or werewolves. I definitely recommend this series as must-read!"
5,Wow! Exciting novel,"WOW. Exciting mystery with not too much gore. It is described, but not in so much detail as to make you ill. Terrific writing kept me turning the page, even at work. Thrilling to the end, it is possible to guess the killer, but not until later in the book. (A nice change from the fluffies) The last chapters are action packed. Worth reading I got through the 300 odd pages in less than one day so I can honestly say and fast read."
1,"Turn down the piano, please!","How does a disc this bad get released? It's impossible to evaluate the performance, because the piano all but drowns out the singer. The singer sounds like she's in the next room; the piano sounds like it's in your lap."
5,love seth walker,"i was turned on to seth walker by a friend who saw him at a blues festival. i love his voice. leap of faith is better than this one, but i liked this one too. try them both."
5,After Years I found these great shoes !!,A number of years back I found shoes that were comfortable to me. They were the Zeeta brand and made in the USA. I bought 5 pairs of them. They are now worn out and not made any longer. Now I found these shoes and bought a pair to try. After one day I knew they were the shoes I was looking for al this time. I just ordered 3 more pairs.
5,Excellent walking shoe,"I bought these shoes for my husband because he walks a lot and often gets aches and pains in his feet. He says the Propet shoes are extremely comfortable and light, and so far his best walking shoes.I will definitely get him another pair when he wears out this one."
3,super slick soles,"Nice looking shoe, but the soles are made of some sort of plastic that are extremely slick. OK for walking on rough surfaces like blacktop or gravel but on smooth tile floors, like in the mall, it's nearly impossible to stand up in them"
3,"TOO HOT AND DON'T BREATHE, BUT THEY ARE COMFORTABLE","Pretty comfortable, but get very hot inside. They don't breathe and I've never had that issue before.Pros: Comfortable, look nice, durableCons: Don't breathe well"
2,Size runs short and has a flat toe box,I wear size 12 1/2 but size 13 in the Propet Men's M4070 Village Walker was too short and the toe box was too flat rubbing against the top of my toes. The shoes looked well made and had a well cushioned sole. I returned the shoes but did not order a larger size because of the flat toe box problem.
5,Finally!,"Me: Heavy, 265lbs, 5'8, diabetic, heel pain, somewhat high arches.The Shoes: Gret, no pain cushion in insole but ALSO in the sole itself."
3,THIS IS A BIG BAND ALBUM THAT MOST CAN ENJOY.,I HAVE ALWAYS LIKED BIG BAND MUSIC. THIS ALBUM IS A GOOD ALBUM. IT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IF SOME OF THE ARRANGEMENTS HAD WORKED. OF THE 24 TRACKS LISTED I ONLY LIKED 11. THAT IS WHY I DIDN'T GIVE IT A HIGHER RATING.
3,Seloc Marine Engine Maintenance and Repair Manuals OMC All Cobra/King Cobra Stern Drive and Gas Engines 1986 to 1998,"Excellent manual for repair purposes, but can be a little too technical at times."
5,Excellent,I am neither an audiophile nor an expert on Irving Berlin and Ella Fitzgerald. I simply know what I like and I like this CD a whole lot! No disappointments here!!
4,John Ashley: Vessel Of Eeevil...,"John Ashley stars as a wicked man who is ""saved"" from death by the devil, only to find himself enslaved to the evil one and his plans to corrupt mankind. Ashley agrees to possess those whom the devil wishes to destroy. Ashley's spirit ends up in the bodies of different men throughout several decades, before winding up inside a man w/ a beautiful wife (Charlotte Wilcox). Ashley gets tired of his deal w/ satan, who responds by turning him into a hideous nocturnal monster! BOTYN has loads of ultra-cheeeezy gore and a rather surprising sex scene tossed in! Heck, there's even a philosophical debate between Ashley and beelzebub! Not bad..."
2,"Bad movie, but great for the Horror Movie collector","I am very fond of old horror movies, and gory stuff, but this movie wasent to good, only buy this if you are a big fan of horror movies. This video should be rated R, for the nudity(they dont tell you this on the box or on the site). When you first turn on the menu and click play movie, it's like a drive in, with lots of mid 20 year old women flashing people. As for the gore it's very cheap. Take my word, only buy this if your a collector!"
1,GARBAGE!,Ok bought this card and then had to hunt down the drivers. I eventually found them after an hour. Installed the drivers and it worked for about 1 day then stopped. Now even if it worked properly the drivers so old and are unsupported it is not worth it to save a few bucks buying this piece of crap.
2,EPSTEIN (of Philly) NEEDS A HEARING AID(E),"MS. BENJAMIN SOUNDS UNSURE OF HERSELF. AND WHY NOT--SHE CANNOT EVEN FIND SOME OF THE NOTES SHE'SSUPPOSED TO BE SINGING.SOME ""CRITICS"" --PROFESSIONAL WRITERS, MAYBE, BUTCLEARLY UNTRAINED IN THE NUANCES OF JAZZ VOCALPRODUCTION-- SHOULD BE VERY CAREFUL WHO THEYPUT IN THE ""TOP 10"" OF ANY LIST, INCLUDINGJAZZ.HERE'S AN EXAMPLE OF WHY NOT TO BELIEVE EVERYTHINGTHAT HAPPENS TO BE ""IN PRINT."""
4,Non technical Econometrics Book!!!!,"I agree with the other reviewers, so my contribution is marginal.The book attains its objectives of making Econometrics easier.But it is a companion book.Since it is a non-technical text, alone, this book will not help to implement econometric models.Next editions must contain GMM method.It has a good competitor: Learning and Practice of Econometrics, by Griffith, et alli."
4,Soft blankey for the Raider fan baby....,"This is a great gift for a Raider fan's baby. I bought it for my friends baby's 1st birthday. Delivery took a week (bummer)because it was delivered from a online shop not Amazon. The product itself was nice, super soft cotton material. Cute Raider teddy bear logo."
3,Decent and look pretty good...but hurt after a while.,"I like them - they look just like the picture, are reasonably comfy for a steel toe boot. I have normal width feet and they hurt the toes after a day of wearing. My pinky toes don't like them. They are the cooler looking steel toe out there.Edit - a couple years later they've broken in nicely but man oh man they scrunch your toes after walking around a plant all day. Can;t wait to get them off."
3,Lasted year and half,I purchased these off Amazon for $54 a couple years ago. After a year and a half of shopfloor walking the insides had worn off and the steel plate started rubbing my toes and ruining socks. Still look good though.
3,Mud stompers,Nice boots for the money.Plan on replacing the insoles when you get these. The ones that come in it are about as thick as a folded in half papertowel
5,is good,"it is good, comes in glass which is good for spice. I would recamend you see if your local store has it first."
2,A pain in the arse.,"From and anonymous reveiw printed in the ""British Critic"" for July 1824 on Hogg's ""Confessions"": ""There are three good reasons for reading books: first to be instructed by them; secondly to be amused; and thridly, to review them. The first does not apply at all to the tale befor us; as to the second, there are but few whose taste it will suit...;the third carried us through with that proud conciousness of martrydom for the public good, to which we are but too much accustomed when labouring in our vocation."""
2,A pain in the Arse,"From and anonymous reveiw printed in the ""British Critic"" for July 1824 on Hogg's ""Confessions"": ""There are three good reasons for reading books: first to be instructed by them; secondly to be amused; and thridly, to review them. The first does not apply at all to the tale befor us; as to the second, there are but few whose taste it will suit...;the third carried us through with that proud conciousness of martrydom for the public good, to which we are but too much accustomed when labouring in our vocation."""
1,Completely Misrepresents Predestination & Runs Many a Rabbit Trail!,"I tried to like this novel because as one who believes in predestination, I thought it would show some of the opposing arguments in fictional form; it failed to do this. James Hogg merely shows us a deranged human being (nothing new there!) who murders because he feels that he is 'destined for heaven' no matter what he does. Yes, he might have been saved from the fires of hell, but it would have been by God's grace, not by his own good or evil works. Isn't this what the New Testament is all about-grace in spite of man's evil doing? Whether one is predestined or 'chooses good or evil' makes no difference in the end-what matters is who saves you from your own mortal destiny which is death. This story fails to show any unique theological and/or psychological perspective. I was dissatisfied with the author's far-fetched and anti-logical presentation of a doctrine he clearly did not understand."
3,Reasonable price but crash and overheated easily,"A month ago, I bought this laptop for my wife as a gift for her daily office use. The price is good. However, the AMD CPU is so poor that it easily be overheated and the laptop sometimes die, even ctl-alt-del does not work. This is the first laptop I bought. I suggest if you want more reliability, choose Intel CPU laptop instead."
4,"OK Album, except for a few stinkers","This is a good album overall, with songs liek Superman's Dead, Clumsy, and 4am(My personal favorite song on the album.) There are a few bad songs, but the rest of the album is intriguing. The lyrics are meaningful, and the instrumentals sound great."
5,Didn't Lose A Step,"Wow. I didn't think these guys could get better than their last CD (Naveed), but I think they did it. Where Naveed was more exploring and not so rock-focused, Clumsy is just that -- good, hard, honest rock music that anyone can enjoy. No matter what kind of music you like, if you're a fan of rock of any kind, get this album. Trust me. The best song is ""Superman's Dead""."
5,OLP Does It Again,While not quite as good as Naveed Our Lady Peace has managed to assemble a very enjoyable album. OLP crashed into the mainstream with the first single (Superman's Dead) from this album. Most of America didn't listen to OLP at this point but the U.S. is now warming up to the group. If you own Happiness then you will love this album since it is just slightly different from Happiness. For those who have never heard OLP this is a good album to cut your teeth on (metaphorically).
5,I think that this is like one of the kewlest bands ever!!!,"I found myself falling in love with the one song one man army. It kicks!!! This really got me into the grooves of what real music is like. Now that I have discovered Our Lady Peace, on my list of favorite CDs, they are ranked #1. I love musical groups from other countries and Canada's groups rule. I hope that everyone buys this CD because it rocks!!!!! :}"
1,Not worth buying,"This band is in the same boat as 3rd Eye Blind, Tonic, and Matchbox20. They lack originality, and all the album is is radio fluff designed for radio airplay. As long as albums like this are selling, rock music is in a state of decline. Avoid, avoid, and VOID!"
5,A+,"Great Album, not much else to say.Might not be for everyone but who cares as long as you like it...right?Cracked my disk, this was a replacement. Shipped fast, Amazon Rocks."
5,Amazingly talented and insightful.,"Our Lady Peace has done a wonderful thing with this album, they weren't afraid to try some new stuff out. Naveed was great, and expectations for Clumsy were of the same degree. Lucky for us, Our Lady Peace decided to expand themselves. The title track, Superman's Dead, and Automatic Flowers all prove that. This is an excellent record, one of the standard that you can just stick it in your CD player and let it go."
1,WORST ALBUM OF THE YR,"This is to be the worst album I have bought this year, if not ever! I'm serious! I will not even take the time to go into the details of why it is so damn bad ... However, if you are under 18, this may be your ticket - anyone wanna but it off me? I'm taking offers starting at a dime!"
3,good post-grunge album,"I'm not going to say THIS ALBUM IS THE GREATEST THING EVER RECORDER, but I'm sure not going to say ""there are only two songs and the rest are pure cr*p.) What I will say is that Clumsy is a cool post-grunge album with some touching songs that are fun to sing along with (i.e. Carnival and 3 am). It's certainly not as furious as Naveed, and it has a few clanky throwaways, but if you're in the mood for some kinda sad, yet often uplifting ""yelp 'n' yowl"" vocals then Clumsy doesn't disappoint. A nice point about Clumsy, it's not as pessimistic as OLP's debut."
5,The Greatest Album ever,I believe this is one of the greatest cds ever. I enjoyed every song on this whole cd and none of them ever get tiring. I recomend this cd to anyone that likes alternative what so ever
3,Not as good as their first CD...,"I bought this one because I liked ""Clumsy"" and SUperman's Dead. I thought it was a decent CD, and I was happy about the purchase. Then I got ""Naveed"", and it makes this album pale. If you're gonna get one OLP CD, make it the first one (odds are, it's cheaper too)."
2,a.k.a. Smashing Pumpkins,"If you like the Pumpkins, but this if not stay well clear. The lead singer has the sames drowning cat voice quality (if you like that sort of thing)."
2,Ummmm. Nope.,"I heard the song Superman's Dead on the radio and then proceeded to buying this album and I was horribly dissapointed. Nothing in this album, although not all bad, really interested me. OLP's sound is too generic and similar from song to song. I have only really listened to it five or so times through, but that was more then neccesary to know that this album will not grow on you. I would suggest something Weezer or Ben Folds Five before buying this album."
1,"More modern metal music, will it never end?","Once upon a time, I dreamed that metal music would go away; I even thought for a while that it had happened. Sadly, I was deluded, and I have come to feel that bands like Our Lady Of Peace exist only to torment me for my hubris."
1,This band sucks,This music sucks so bad it's an insult to canadian music. The vocals are unbearable too.
5,Memorable performances,"Nearly all the performances here are among the best available (with the exception of the Nuages, which is just too brisk to convey a dreamily evocative mood), and also in the best sound these recordings have ever received, sometimes (depending on the source) of truly high fidelity quality.La Mer is the standout selection for me because this performance conveys an epic grandeur that one does not usually hear in this music, together with an acute sensitivity to beauty of sound, nuance of phrasing and clarity of texture. In particular, Toscanini brings out significantly more detail and dynamic inflections in the brass writing than I have heard from other recordings.An essential purchase for this repertoire."
4,Looking 4 a song...,"I'm hoping this CD has a song thats been stuck in my brain for almost 20 years. I've heard it maybe 3 to 5 times & it was awesome. I even saw the video way back when & wanted the song. It was called, ""I've got to keep on"". I never had the opportunity to pick up this jam but I'm doing my best to locate it. It doesn't say what songs are on these CDs though. If someone could please let me know, I'd appreciate it..."
3,Am I The Only One That Remembers?,"Okay, I used to have this tape 16 years ago. I still had these songs ringing in my head 16 yeasr later so I decided to re-add it to my collection. I do feel a little dated listening to it, but this is old school rap for me. I remember it so I guess that is why I love this CD."
1,Deceptive; nothing but a pilot bearing,Looks nothing like the photo or the description. Just a small bearing (available elsewhere at half the price) to go in the center of flywheel to accept the clutch shaft.
3,good style but moderate quality,The metal frame sticked out for couple times. Good style though. But I dont like the inner fabric.
4,simply awesome,"Most people when you ask them about this album, will cite the more popular track ""Locked and Loaded"" but with tracks like ""Dumbass Country Boy"" which really speaks to the state of the music industry and mainstream fans imo, the track that really doesn't seem to get much notice is ""Misery Loves Company"" which is easily my faovrite song on the album. Looking forward to seeing them at the House of Blues later this month. While it's not as good as their debut album, it deserves better than a 3."
1,Get the Lonely Planet,"Took the Lonely Planet (published in 2006) and Frommer's (published in 2008) to Greece. The somewhat out-dated LP is so much better than the Frommer's and we used LP almost exclusively after the first 3 days. The Frommer's maps are frustrating and misleading. There is no (bus) directions for day trips out of Athens so you must either drive or join a tour. The information (history, background, etc) is fine but you can find similar information on the LP too."
3,Disappointed!,"I am a big fan of Frommer's but very disappointed in this Kindle edition. The ""next chapter' feature doesn't work so you have to scroll through all of the pages. The majority of the pictures are removed and it is difficult to see and zoom in on any of the maps - essentially making them useless. Also, I'm fairly certain not all of the pages are included (in comparison to the print edition). One of the main reasons I wanted a Kindle was so that when I travel, I didn't have to lug around my beloved and essential travel books. Perhaps as the Kindle-world continues to expand, the travel books will get better. But for now, I'd stick to the paperback edition."
4,Very informative book,"My friends are planning to visit Greece, and the book was a perfect gift to them."
4,Very helpful!,"This was a pretty good book! I haven't looked at the other ones, so maybe they would be helpful. A couple of the prices were off. We went to museums in Athens, for example, on days when they were supposed to be free and they weren't. Still, I would recommend it because you're going to get the barebones of what you need for a trip to Greece."
3,why I did not take this guide on trip,"Packs a lot of info. But with any guide, take recommendations on hotels, tours, places to eat with a big grain of salt. Money or comps may have changed hands for favorable reviews. I took R. Steve's guide to Med. cruise ports with me because I was on a cruise and wanted to sightsee on my own instead of taking the cruise's overpriced, hackneyed tours and I found Steves' guide to local transportation, including getting away from the port terminal itself, to be much more useful. In other ways the Frommer guide was OK."
4,I am even more excited to travel to Greece now that I have this book!`,This is a detailed book about all the important Greek tourist spots and some hidden treasure spots also. The Athens hotel and restaurant reviews are very helpful as we plan our family trip; as are the suggestions for family travel as we will be visiting with our 4 year old this summer. I hope Greece lives up to its reputation AND the details included in this travel guide book!
3,Fromer's Greece,This is definitely a good travel book however some parts of the book (even though you get a current copy) may already be outdated especially when it comes to hotels and restaurants. You can get better info on the internet and definitely will be more up to date. Still it's a good travel book if you purchase it at a discount price.
2,Not for us,"We knew Frommer's was geared more toward people with a larger travel budget than we had, but we were still disappointed with this guide. It didn't offer intra-city travel options and most of the museum/sight information was outdated. We missed Rick Steves on this leg of our trip."
1,The content of this book is almost the same as its 2006 version,"I ordered this book because that in the description page of this book, it clearly wrote down Humana Press (May 19, 2010). It should contain the most up-to-date information of microRNA. I paid $139 and received this book from Amazon. One of my colleague pointed out to me that the content of this book is almost the same as its 2006 version. I went back to check the description page in Amozon and make sure it says may 19, 2010 and nothing about 2006 version. As miRNA is a rapid developing field in biology, the outdated information is certainly not worth $139 and not worth my time to read it."
4,"Heartbreaker a little weak, Crimes of Passion remarkable","Heartbreaker as an album is a little weak, in my opinion. This CD luckily contains Crimes of Passion, an album that contains some of Pat's greatest recorded moments. Ironically, the singles are not the songs that impress here, but rather the unknown yet awesome songs like Wuthering Heights, Out a Touch and Prisoner of Love."
2,Looks like a good unit but damaged in shipping 3 times!,This product arrived with the case broken. Amazon nicely tried to send it to me two more times but each time it arrived damaged. It appears to be a quality unit and other reviewers confirm that it is. The problem is that it is very heavy and poorly packaged by the manufacturer. There is only one piece of crumpled-up paper around the unit and everything is beat up during shipping. I was told by Amazon that they are going to demand that the manufacturer come up with a better packing system.
1,Arrived broken!,"I didn't think it would happen to me, but it did. Several previous reviews mentioned the condition the item arrived in and I regret to report the same. I waited forever for this unit and it arrived like it had been packaged by a 5 year old. I knew by the condition of the box that it was going to be a bad day. The miscellaneous parts and connectors were strewn all over the inside, and the case was broken in a couple of places, making it impossible to lift the unit by the handle. Anyway, I returned it immediately and will not try again. Next time I will listen to the reviews!"
3,Never got to try it out....,"...because, like other reviewers, I got mine ""damaged in shipment."" The shipping carton was in excellent shape, however, and the box with the TRXXX inside was foamed-in-place inside of that carton. I'm guessing the thing got to me exactly how it was packed... with a broken casing, and with various pieces and parts ""floating"" around inside. It may have been the same unit received by others and returned to Amazon. Well, mine went back to them also. Guess it's not fair to AR to rate this item poorly since I never actually tried it, but hey, I can't justify rating it any better, either... anyway, it's on it's way back, and for a REFUND not replacement; I didn't want to risk having to carry another 65# box back to the Post Office again!"
1,"This Merchant, ""Mimetic Eye LLC"", is a WORTHLESS LIAR","I ordered this book, described as ""NEW"", as a gift for a young relative. The book arrived ""USED"" with YELLOW PAGES, TEARS ALL OVER THE OUTER COVER, INK MARKS, DOG-EARED PAGES, and with Old Remnants of a PRICE STICKER on the COVER.As to the actual book and it's contents itself, I received a ""NEW"" copy of it many years ago and found it to be very enlightening and very humorous.Definitely a terrific book for a young man to read(or many older guys too).Buy it, you'll learn stuff and you'll enjoy it.Just don't buy this, or anything else, from this ""FRAUD of a company, ""Mimetic Eye LLC"".They never even replied once to multiple emails and phone calls, otherwise I would not have posted such a negative commentary.AMAZON should not allow these people to do business on their website."
5,Had this for 8 years,"This is the finest book ever written for men and the questions we are all afraid to ask. A friend got it for me in late 1990 and then I lost it in 1995. Luckily, it was still in print and I could get a new copy. This manual of life should be given to all men when they graduate from high school as I tried to do for another friend this year. I am glad I didn't give it to him since it is no longer in print. This book is as indispensable to the American male as the towel is to the hitchhiker in the galaxy!!"
4,good psych rock,"This is the one before the band changed into the monster boogie rockers in 1970. However this one is good psych rock and psych pop mixture all the way. IT's a decent disc and has some fine moments on it like 'face without a soul' and some more average songs but the two disc version really gives you alot of kick butt stuff to enjoy so this is the version to get. Fans of later quo will want to get this one last probably , however it still has alot of good songs on it from the age of psych rock, this is more accessible too than lets say pink floyeds ummaguma which is a fine cd but less pop inclined. ALl in all this is worth owning for fans of psych rock, psych pop, and quo fans too."
5,All tap dancers need this video!,"For quite a while, I have been looking for a Shim Sham Shimmy video or clear written instructions on the dance. I am more than pleased with this video. It is wonderfully organized in an up-beat, easy-to-learn fashion. I have loaned this video to a 7 year old student and she had no problem following it. (But it's just as much fun for a 50+ student as well!) A great buy!"
2,Difficult to follow,"As a early-intermediate tapper, I was disappointed by this video. While it was very cool to see Leonard Reed himself speak in the intro, the actually teaching of the dance leaves a lot to be desired.First, the instructor talks you through the steps while facing you, so you have to try to reverse everything on your own, which is extremely difficult. Then, when she finally does turn around to demonstrate, she doesn't talk through the steps anymore, so you constantly have to rewind to learn the steps. To make matters MUCH worse, the beat is kept by a tapping in the background, which sounds almost exactly like the instructor's tap shoe, making it very difficult to figure out the steps by ear.I did make it through the tape, but it took a very long time. And this was just a refresher, because I learned the shim sham in a dance class a couple years ago."
2,False intentions,"I chose this rating because the ""book"" was really a pamplet and to expensive for the little materal that was in the pages."
4,Onslaught - 'In Search Of Sanity' (Blackened Records),"I remember this late '80's metal release, believe it featured former Grim Reaper vocalist / frontman Steve Grimmett (one of hell's true rejects - keep in mind he's on this Onslaught record only). Tunes here I got the most out of were the title track ""In Search For Sanity"", the in-your-face ""Lightning War"", their decent cover of AC/DC's anthem ""Let There Be Rock"" and ""Welcome To Dying"". Might draw in fans of Celtic Frost, Possessed, King Diamond and Cryptic Slaughter {have always loved that name}. Not bad at all."
4,A Gem,"This band, I don't know if they ever made it big, but they should. Their sound on this album is a little like early Metallica, with nice fast crunchy riffs and a little more ""techno"" sound for lack of a better word.Songs are excellent, especially the long, trance-like ""Welcome to Dying."" ""Blood Upon the Ice"", ""Power Play"", the Title track -- all good.Don't be misled by the opening track -- it's just a warmup, not their real sound.This ""platter"" gets a lot of play on my ""turntable"" these days."
5,Good CD,The decline is a very good cd I would recomend it to any NO F-X fans. My sad story is that last wendnesday night I bought the cd from a local music store (for $13 and some odd sense when right on the back it says pay no more than $11 for this cd) listened to it then listened to another cd my freind just bought. By 10:30pm less than 3 hours later we can't find the cd very traumatizing event made me very angry. So with a very good cd lost I now look for a good deal so I can replace this cd.
3,Another interesting idea from Fat Wreck Chords,"it actually gets 3 1/2 stars. Just like with fat wreck chords' ""short music for short people"", the concept of having 1, 18 minute song on a cd was interesting, but has its downsides. To get to any part of the song you particulary like you have to fast-forward or listen to whole song which doesn't get that boring at least. As for music itself, ""the decline"" is varied in music and goes from slow to fast all the time, but there is a central theme to the lyrics. the whole 18 minute song is about the questioning of religious faith, the american government and basically the fall of humanity, hence the name ""the decline."" i would of guessed that they were making fun of themselves again when they called their cd the decline but it actually has to do with the song itself. most of the lyrics are good, the cd is just typical nofx. the decline is very much one song, it just took 18 minutes to say everything they wanted for one theme. pretty good but not their best."
3,READ THIS BEFORE YOU BUY IT!,This cd is good...espescially for nofx. i like it a lot. although if you are planning to buy it be prepared for only 1 song that's 18 minutes long! kinda a ripoff...right? well for the 18 minutes that's on this cd it's good..but dont expect too much!
5,the best $11 i've ever spent,"I have to say that I haven't been a NOFX fan all my life only because my friend told me about them about a year ago (I'm writing this in 2000). He told me to buy The Decline. I did, and it was the best $11 i've ever spent (seriously, if you don't like the idea of buying one song for $11, then don't. I'm not stopping you, but you won't know what you're missing). I love the clever lyrics about their views on the government. The drumming was great, Mike's bass sounded excellent, and the trombone part was absolutely gorgeous. And you get over 18 minutes of this stuff that I call punk rock at its best, on a clear CD with the recorded part of the disc the only part not transparent. If you have $11 (if you're ordering off Amazon.com, then you gotta pay an extra few dollars for S and H) and you want to listen to the best punk rock you can get, then buy this EP. It will be the best $11 you'll ever spend."
5,A PUNK ROCK MASTERPIECE,"Although the price I paid for this was ridiculous , I don't care. It is a masterpiece of a song."
5,this cd is great,i love this cd i recomend it to all of you punkrockcers out there. it is the best single song that i have ever heard in my entire life its so great
5,Dope!!,"Like all other NOFX albums, they keep rippin out better and better stuff. Although some people didn't Like SO Long's ska side to it, this has some ska, but is great. A definite buy"
5,Perfection????,"Yes. this album is the closest i have ever heard to perfection. it gets me so pumped up with the chanting and shouting and the fast paced music. NOFX's best work yet, by far!! it is even better than ""pump up the valuum."" not to take away from that cd, but this one is truly PERFECT."
4,How can I like it and be disappointed?,"I make no small secret of the fact that my favorite punk album of all time is NOFX's ""So Long and Thanks for All the Shoes"". Through time, they've gotten closer and closer to that perfect synthesis of punk and catchy (NOT POP) that I crave. And ""The Decline"" is pretty much the best example of this synthesis I've ever heard. It's stupidly catchty, it's got a great message, and it's got something for everyone. Hell, it's one of the best songs-not just punk songs, but songs- I've ever heard. But I canot in good conscience say it's worth the bucks I payed for it. There's the one GREAT song, but that is literally it. I don't feel violently ripped off, but I could buy two comps with about 19 songs apiece for the price I paid for ""The Decline"". So, in summation, buy it if you like NOFX, but be aware what you're buying."
2,The Decline Review,"It's been about two years since a new NOFX release until now. On Tuesday, November 23, The Decline was released. It was a dissapointment to a hardcore NOFX fan. It's a one song album but the one song is almost twenty minutes long. I hope they release a real album in the near future because I love these guys."
2,This is the New Album from the guys who made White Trash?,"One twenty minute song is all they could do? I think these guys could have done alot better. But still, the album wasn't a total dissapointment."
1,WHAT THE HELL,"What the hell, if i wanted to listen to a rock opera I would have listened to my Styx album. This is the worst thing since sliced bread. Why in the hell would you want to listen to a 14 min song. I believe the title ""The Decline"" is in reference to the state of there music. Cuz it's on the decline right now. The only thing that this album accomplished was: goverment good, really long songs bad."
5,Can't even describe...,"So it's all been said about this song. Epic, long, ""just one song? What a rip off."" That all aside, this is the NOFX magnum opus. The various musical and lyrical themes blend into possibly the only punk song over 4 minutes long that isn't painful to listen to and is even on the very enjoyable side. I feel that their discography is better previous to and including The Decline and newer albums have lost the edge and wittiness that the old ones had, but they are all a good listen. Amazingly, NOFX is now playing this live! The CD is awesome, but having them hit the stage and open with more than 18 minutes of The Decline is an astounding experience. From the frantic opening bass line to the desperate ""Mel Yell"" injections throughout to the ominous quasi-goose-stepping outro it is a aural piece everyone should experience.""He's got his and I've got mine, meet the decline."""
4,"Not exactly my style, but pretty cool.","I am a metalhead who likes some progressive and classic rock. I'm not generally a big fan of punk, but when i heard about this 18 minute punk song, I had to check it out. I have to say, while it's not exactly my style, it's cool to see a punk band do this. A long song, written quite well. Good lyrics. These guys can play their instruments, especially the drummer, and the music is pretty complicated(for a punk band, that is, for a metal or prog. band...maybe not, but hey, that's not the point of punk, is it?)and it's just a well-written song. Even though it's not my style, these guys impressed me, and I respect them for this song. If punk is your thing, get this, I bet you'll enjoy it."
4,Good for NOFX,I don't listen to punk at all. I used to but it got old. Someone burnt me this CD. And well I was suprized that I liked it. It doesnt have that immature tone you get with most of their other stuff. Their are some subtle jokes and innuendos on things but it is not potty humor or anything like that. Im sure it took them twice the time to write this than anyother album they have released.
4,"Fine music, excellent sonics.","This set, recorded live at the Village Vanguard in 1986, captures this piano trio scaling the heights of sensitive, interactive music-making. Though recorded live, the sound is superb. Each instrument is clearly recorded and the balance between them is near-perfect. I was taken aback to hear the applause at the end of the first tune - I assumed from the sound that I was listening to a studio recording. The late David Baker was the engineer, and this is a fine example of the exacting standards of his work."
2,Great music; horrible recording,"Caveat emptor. Steve Kuhn is a great pianist, and this disc has some wonderful music. But I won't go into detail about it because it's so poorly recorded, I can't listen to it anymore. The bass (played by the great Ron Carter) is non-existent. AVOID. The sound quality will just frustrate you."
4,5 years later and still sounding fresh and new,"It's hard to believe but it's been almost 5 years since twin sisters Heather and Jennifer Kinley stormed onto the country music scene with their debut album ""Just Between You and Me"". Breezing through 10 songs in just over 34 min., the album today retains its fresh sound.The title track (and hit single) is one of the best songs, giving Heather and Jennifer a great song to showcase their voices as well as their song-writing abilities (they co-write about half of the songs on the album). Other great tracks include ""Talk to Me"", ""Crazy Kind of Love Thing"" and, perhaps the best track of all, the intimate ""Contradiction"".As far as ""traditional"" country goes, it does not get much better than this album. I'm not particularly big on country music, but ""Just Between You and Me"" easily appealed to me on the strenght of its melodies and harmonies."
4,"Better than expected, well worth the money","From the price and the look one might think these are ""throw-away"" blades in the pejorative. But no, after many many cuts, a close examination under a 20x microscope shows almost no wear to the itty-bitty carbide tips. These blades are thin and light, but precise and surprisingly robust. The thin kerf means less power is required to cut through a given board. This really matters in 5/4 plywood or hardwood decking, but means faster work everywhere else. They are only ""throw-away"" because they cost less than the price of sharpening them. There might be enough carbide in the tip for one re-sharpening, but it would not be cost effective. I welcome ideas in the comments section for how to recycle these beauties. Highly recommended to the hobbyist and professional alike."
5,Brief Encounter,David Buday is truly an inspiration. my wife christina and I love his music so much we played it at our wedding. you will forever be a part of our lives and memories. marc and christina
2,THIS CD TRIED TO BE SOMETHING IT'S NOT.,THIS IS THE FIRST DAVID BUDWAY CD THAT I HAVE BOUGHT. THE PROBLEM I HAVE WITH THIS CD IS THAT HE TRIED TO PUT TOO MANY OF HIS OWN SONGS ON IT. HE USED SOME SONGS THAT WHERE HOUDEHOLD NAMES BUT NOT ENOUGH. HE SHOULD STICK WITH SONGS THAT PEOPLE KNOW AND ENJOY.
5,Extremely useful,"Although now ""well seasoned,"" Toby's book is an excellent account of the Tokugawa's relationships with Korea, the Ryukyu Kingdom, and China during the Tokugawa period. The Ryukyu section is particularly useful given the dearth of literature in English on the subject."
4,Thinking Man's Book,This book challenged my thinking and kept me turning the pages. The open minded person can learn something of life from this book.
4,beware of size!,"i'm a big guy, 38"" waist, but these are WAY smaller than marked: i got the 2x large (40""-50"" waist) and they barely fit."
5,Debunked at last!,"From first page to last, Mr Stafford delivers as promised, a thorough review of primary as well as secondary sources. I couldn't help but be amazed at the omnipresence of the idiotic gossip that has masqueraded for centuries as ""revelations"" of Mozart's life and work, now unmasked by Mr Stafford. Essential in any library of Mozart biography!"
2,Had to return product,The bow tie fell apart and could not be used. Had to return the set for refund. Cummerbund would have worked out fine.
1,I did not read or review this book,This rating report is an error. I have never heard of this book until I saw that I had reviewed it.
5,The Living Legacy,"This box set is a MUST for all Fogelberg fans. All of his incredible hits are included, mixed with fabulous lesser known titles. For the new listener who's been drawn in by Fogelberg's well known and often played ""Leader of the Band"" and ""Longer"", this purchase will continue to inspire and amaze. Dan Fogelberg's music is the mastery of poetry in motion. I remember hearing him on the radio as a young child but have only recently, in my late 20's discovered my deep love and appreciation for his music. I've attended his concerts each year for the last three years, and have been blown away. Some will say Fogelberg's music is a thing of the past. Those that listen to his music today will appreciate the timeless quality that continues embrace and inspire many."
3,Glaring Omission!,"While it's true this is a wonderful collection of the works of Dan the Man I was taken aback by a glaring omission. How can anyone associated with Dan put together this box set without including ""A Place in the World for a Gambler."" This is my all time favorite Fogelberg tune. Every concert of his I attended, he played this as his encore and the audience sang along. I get chills thinking about those shows yet that song is missing from this set. I think they should re-issue the ballads disc with the addition of ""Gambler"", then this would truly be a ""Portrait"" of Dan Fogelberg."
5,Dan's the Man.,"Can't stop enjoying these CDs. Driving in the car I'll pop one in, sit back and mellow out. I know every word by heart and am in my glory when Dan's in my head. It's fun also because the songs are, of course, out of the order from when they appeared on his original albums. What pleasant surprises."
2,Loved it!,"What a talented singer and songwriter! We haven't heard from Dan in a while and listening to these CD's was like slipping on a favorite pair of bluejeans. They just make you feel good! (I just went to look at my review-it should read 5 stars, not 2! Can't seem to fix this...)"
2,Better investment elsewhere,"This 4-CD career retrospective is organized stylistically, rather than chronologically; a refreshing idea. And while the set highlights Fogelberg's strengths as a creative and enthusiastic arranger and musician, it also reveals the glaring lyrical weaknesses that have always plagued his work. For fans only; casual listeners should buy the best of."
5,Genius gone,"Have been a fan of Dan Fogelberg for 30 years - a genius at integrating uncommonly beautiful poetry with just the right instrumental backgrounds and rhythms to make the songs expressively complete. He also composed lovely, impressively complex instrumentals which he performed individually and in concert with other gifted musicians. Truly this compilation is a ""Portrait"" of the personality and spirit of DAN FOGELBERG expressed through his music - lots of very familiar tunes, and many which were never played commercially but are great songs and I love nonetheless. We miss you!"
2,Get Very Best Of Instead,Wow - Dan has a few good songs but certainly doesn't have enough quality material to fill up 4 CDs. Also many of the choices here are not good (very bad actually) and why did they put a live version of Leader of the Band on the Hits disc -- the live version WAS NOT A HIT!!!! Where are Sketches and There's A Place In The World For a Gambler?? - probably his 2 best songs! Not a good box set - AVOID!!
5,Portrait: The Music of Dan Fogelberg from 1972-1997,The music was just like I remember it!! And w/ it being on CD now the music and lyrics are crystal clear. I would reccomend this seller to anyone.
2,Hmmmmm,"I am one of those people who like sweet lemon chicken. This is not sweet. It is not spicy, either. The yellow dye is very excessive and your fingers can stain if you touch the sauce. If you want to try it out, I'd recommend buying one packet if you can."
4,"Hit and Miss, but well worth a look","There are a few songs on this CD that don't quite hit the mark, but they are more than made up for by the songs that do. 'This is my Hollywood', 'Nerve Gas' and 'Nuclear Holiday' rock amazingly hard, so the fact is that the other songs are all quite good, but are put in the shade by half a dozen absolute stormers."
3,Good,This is the first offering from 3 Colours Red and these guys show that they have the power the guts and the talent to establish theirselves in the punk rock community .
5,"Purchased as a nostalgia trip, not disappointed","This is the second time in 20+ years that I've purchased this double album masterpiece. This time around mainly because I wanted to be able to play ""Jesus Was Way Cool"" from ""the cloud"" without fooling with uploading it. Still entertaining, still worthwhile...even if I didn't have the early 90s memories of hearing it for the first time. And for you ADD Generation wtfever types, there are enough good songs on here to justify buying the whole thing. You kids get outta my yard and go listen to this."
2,Puzzling should be more like it,"some great guitar rock....who cares though? ric ocasek is maybe the best songwriter i pop today!, but not 1 song that showcases this concept. what a waste of his writing talents. Note: billy corgon (smashing pumpkins) producer and plays on the album,... not much help though.Come On ric you still have some great potential to do a break through album!"
1,What happened to the upbeat-cutting edge Cars sound????,What a pathetic excuse for music. This has got to be the worst I have ever heard from Mr Ocasek. The dark and often whiny sounds fit perfectly with the twisted lyrics. I guess its just too tough for old Ric being a millionaire and married to a supermodel. Really a shame....
2,Simply Troubling,"If this work is any indication, Ric may be fading away into obscurity. There are some good cuts from this CD (Hang on Tight, Not Schocked, Society Trance and The Next Right Moment), but after listening to this CD a few times, most will grow old and tired, especially the title cut. Rarely do I listen to a CD of an artist I like and find that I enjoy it less when I listen to it more... this is one of them. If you're interested in some better solo projects by Ocasek, go for This Side of Paradise or Quick Change World... those are his two best. Some would argue that Beatitude was his best, and though I like that one too, it wasn't as solid musically as Paradise or Quick Change. Quick Change is out of print, so you'll need to peruse used CD stores or find it on eBay."
4,his best solo album,"Most definitely some of the best stuff Ocasek's done. Billy Corgan helped produce this as well as play guitar on most (all?) of the cuts, and his influence shines throughout the album. Melissa auf der Maur (Hole) and Brian Baker (Bad Religion) round out the project. The sound overall is very tight and and the tracks are varied. The first five songs are the best portion of the album, but the whole LP is very enjoyable to listen to. It's great to hear Ric with a band and producer who can fully capitalize on his distinct voice and style. This is definitely worth buying, especially if you're a Cars or Smashing Pumpkins fan."
3,a few energic songs & some songs wasted by bad lyrics,"This cd has a few strong songs like the next right moment,here we go or fix on you.i also would have likedhang on tight if it wasn't spoiled by an f word(ocasek makesit end with a t instead of a k but it still sounds pretty much the same).Indeed,ocasek has had the need to put some bad lyricsin a few songs(he also did it in the past,even in a title!) wasting the pleasure in them for me,a thing that he never did on his albums with the cars.I don't think that ric ocasek has ever done a soloalbum with songs as strong as a cars album all the way throughand this cd is no exception but the good ones are pretty strong."
3,Loud and clear (when they work at all...),"I purchased four of these for use in my photography workshops, with the thought of buying eight more.. The transmission quality is excellent, but on three of the four, the push-to-talk button either stopped working altogether or required great pressure to activate, and is sporadic in its function. Very frustrating in the field when you are counting on them."
2,What range?,"I was counting on the brand Motorola, but...Design is nice, but 2 big compaints are:1. 3 AA batteries per walki's not to mention the weight. If you plan to purchase 4 of these that means 12 AA's! The batt level indicator is already down a level (in about 10 days).2. Disapointing Range. They say up to 2 miles, but I get about 1 mile at the most. I live in a very flat (Michigan) and less populated area. I suspect the range will go down even more in a city area."
4,Nice range,"Bought these for deer hunting in WI. Have a good range, decent sound clarity, and pretty good battery life. I hunt in a pretty traditional deer camp, so there was a lot of speculation on the part of my hunting partners to having radios in the woods. To be honest, I was too. By the end of the season we were all sold on the benefits. If you're thinking about it but not quite sure, take the plunge. It makes your hunt much more productive. Even if you only turn them on for a few minutes each hour to check in, it helps a lot to know where your hunting crew is to coordinate movement in the woods. For the price, you can't go wrong"
1,doesn't work,"I have been using this product, following the instructions faithfully, for approx. 3 weeks and my nails are still splitting, peeling and breaking. Absolutely no improvement - a waste of time and money."
5,nails,I just think this is the greatest as my nails finally are growing.My nails always chipped and broke now they are nice and long
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"This product didn't do what it states once applied within two days the polish starts to peel off of and three of my nails so far has broke. This was a waste of money, I'm going back to Nail Tek 2."
1,Mariology It Ain't,"I concur with another reviewer: get Luigi Gambero's ""Mary and the Fathers of the Church,"" and, I might add, his follow-up work, ""Mary in the Middle Ages."" Read these two books alongside ""Truly Our Sister. . .,"" then decide whether 15 or 16 centuries of organic, historically contiguous development of the Church's Marian doctrine by some of the finest minds and hearts the Church has ever produced--including Bridget of Sweden, or Johnson's glib, 21st century, feminist revisionism provides the better spiritual nourishment.The Blessed Virgin Mary stirs us to properly love her divine Son, bringing us into the intimate recesses of the Trinitarian love itself! Anything shy of that simply misses the point and leaves one painfully short-changed."
1,Don't waste your money,Try reading Hail Holy Queen by Scott Hahn for starters. This book misrepresents our Blessed Mother. Not sister.
2,Disappointing,"I have been a fan of Mr. Winters all of my life. As a kid, in 1970 or so, I heard on the radio a Jonathan Winters routine about a bunch of guys hunting deer. I laughed and laughed at the time, and ever since have wanted to locate a copy of the recording. Well, I recently found it--on this CD. But, unfortunately, I am disappointed. It is not nearly as funny as I had remembered (and that one is this CD's best track). Moreover, some of his stories on this CD are surprisingly off-color. All in all, while I still think Winters is great, I don't recommend this CD."
4,Very funny stuff,"This recording shows why Winters was light-years ahead of his time and cleared the way for the improvisational comics who came later. Back in the 60's, the idea of a comic making up material on the spot was still quite new. Winters pulls it off here quite well. In fact, his ad-libs are better than his observational stuff. No, it doesn't all work rat-tat-tat like a stand-up comic with a rehearsed show, but that's not the way Winters worked. Remember, some of what he does here was considered scandalous back then -- he knew he had to ease his audience into their seats if he expected them to stay with him on the bus. This recording has many flashes of brilliance and only a few let-downs. I recommend it."
4,Theme Park,"Crichton became really famous for his dinosaur park turned nightmare called Jurassic Park. This movie however was his first foray into a theme park gone bad. Westworld is a classic science fiction with Yul Brynner perfectly cast as the can't be killed robot. The terminator before the terminator. It is a wonderful idea for a park that let you live out your fantasies as a cowboy or a knight(over in Roman world). When a virus causes the harmless robots to turn on the guests and the park employees, you really find yourself involved with the chase. A really well told tale and very ablely directed. It shows a little date with the bad hair and clothing, but overall it holds up well."
4,Very nicely done,"Probably a 4.5. Catchy, crunchy, energetic. Song 2 sounds like an Oasis outtake, then you get some more poppy/punky numbers, plus straight ahead R&R. These songs do not run into one another; the album meanders down numerous paths. One thing that's consistent though; it's fun, and easy to sing along to. Nice album for driving."
2,Not Quite As Good As Earlier Edition,"It is up to date with (most) current equipment and practices (obviously). Although there are more pages to this edition than in previous editions, the extra content seems to contain more verbiage at the expense of tables and graphs.It is disappointing to note the absence of lighting equipment details (photometric data and equipment range) in particular. The focus (pun intended) seems to be more towards cameras, lenses, filters and film.My 4th edition manual has a better balance in terms of verbiage, tables and graphs, and covers lighting equipment in some detail. Although outdated in some areas, the 4th edition will still remain my primary source of information.The ""novelisation"" of this 8th edition has, to a degree, defeated the real purpose of the manual, the provision of readily accessable data via tables and graphs.If you are after lighting equipment details, then look elsewhere, if not, then consider purchasing this latest edition."
2,Garbage.,I was shocked at how little practical information there is in this book. The publisher has the nerve to sell ad space in the book and it appears to be a glorified advertisement for Panavision.I was very disappointed and returned the book.
2,Rubberr part can split and crack eventually,"The first few times I used this, it worked great. Unfortunately, the third or fourth time I used it, the rubber cover developed a small tear and water started leaking out. Maybe I overtightened the screw? Anyway, after another two or three uses, it was pretty much useless. I decided to build a better one myself by getting parts from the hardware storge, but maybe it'll work better for you. Maybe two stars is too harsh, it's not terrible, it just worked out badly for me."
4,Thank you!,"I have a weird faucet, and it took about twenty minutes of finagling to get the adaptor to work. It did work, though, so that's good. I couldn't use my python without it!"
5,so funny !,"I've bought this book on AMAZOM.COM, and I just loved it! it's very funny, i laughed all the time. the characters have a good sense of humour and the story is very cool. I've got the four books, and I really think this is the best one!"
3,Less than the sum of its parts (updated),"I have loved these guys in other recordings (Weber, Colors of Chloe; Frisell, many albums; Mays, with Metheny and Frisell; McCandless, with Oregon), so I was disappointed to hear them mostly not connecting here. Other reviewers have called it a masterpiece, but after 3 listenings I just can't hear it. If you're looking to buy this album for its ""Dream Team"" line up, think twice.NOTE: after about 20 listenings I am liking this album more and more. Most intriguing is Mays's playing. It reminds me of some 20th century classical composer - can't put my finger on who it is. But I stand by my original review in that this music is not for everyone. If you like Pat Metheny, Bill Frisell, and Oregon, you may very well not like this."
5,Love Mobilo!!,"Mobilo is amazing. My 4 year old has been playing with it since he was 2 and it is still one of his favorite activities. He likes it even more than lego! This was actually our 2nd purchase of Mobilo. You get a ton of pieces but now that he is getting older and we have another son who just turned 1, we figured it was time to double our pieces. You can build so many different things. It really gives kids the full potential to be creative. Great activity. I recommend it to all!"
5,Can Crusher,Ordering was easy. Delivery was speedy. Product works wonderfully. Very happy with entire experience and product.
4,Can Crusher,Got tired of driving a truck load of cans filled with air to be recycled. Now I'm driving a truck full of crushed cans to the recyclers and the only air is between the driver seat and the steering wheel.
2,Not so great,The company sent the product as promised and I felt happy with everything until my husband tried using it. The cans tend to pop out when you try to crush them. The only way it seems to avoid this is to put your hand in harms way to hold the can in place. Product needs improvement to resolve this issue.
2,can crusher,Product has one flaw that hampers efficiency. The steel pin holding the piston to the compression arm slips out of piston on one side and causes the crusher to jam. It has to be placed back in the hole. It does a fine job of crushing cans when operating properly. Heavy duty but not indestructable.
2,Poorly Made & Overpriced,"Slap-happy, sloppy construction and low-grade materials ...basically, this is cheap, foreign-made crap. Brand-new it works after a fashion, but the angle of the ram and the surface supporting the can are so far out of parallel alignment that a fair percentage of the aluminum cans squirt out of the machine onto the floor rather than compact all the way. The angles of all surfaces that should be aligned are skewed (including the ram). The reviewers that claim that this item is well-made or heavy duty must work for the importer. This poor-quality item is extremely overpriced for what it is and should probably sell for $9.95 instead of $20."
3,So-so can crusher,"This can crusher is ok. I like that it feels sturdy, but when I'm in a hurry to get through a bag of cans, it seems like 1/4 of them pop/fly/slip out."
3,Stop taking Air to Recycle,"We buy a lot of beverages in aluminum cans no doubt. I got tired of huge bags of mostly air going to be recycled. This thing crushes cans with the force a teenager can muster. I am concerned that the main lever bearings look a little suspect but we'll see. The instructs say to precrush the can - just a thumb print when you put the can in. Prebuckles the can making it easier to collapse. Occasionally the can which is now no longer square over the ends will pop out vigorously when you go to crush it so you need to be aware of that and kind of steady the can until it's crushed enough. The can inevitibly has a small amount of liquid in side that you couldn't get out no matter how hard you tried - the flying can will predictably splash this liquid - where ever. The compacted can is about 3/4"" thick about the size of a hockey puck and you can put several cases in a large plastic bag. Works as advertised. Reasonably attractive on the wall."
5,Great Crusher,"This is a much better crusher than others I've used in the past - very sturdy and doesn't feel like it's going to break before the can crushes. The cans sometimes 'squirt' out , but with a little practice it's no problem. It even easily handles the tall energy drink cans. Easy to mount, too -Highly recommended!"
5,THE REAL DEAL,As advertised. I've been using this crusher for years and wanted on for the office. Don't even waste tour time on the $5.00 ones. THIS IS THE REAL DEAL!
4,Aluminum Can Crusher,I mounted the can crusher on the side of my shop and it seems to be very sturdy. I like that it is all metal construction. It is easy to operate. The only problem I found is that the cans want to slide out when you are crushing them. The base needs a little lip on it.
5,the crusher,yes this is a sturdy item much better then are old one and comes with screws too install thanks Julie
3,works fine,"We had one of these outside before and I really liked it. It even did taller or slightly wider cans. This one does not. It is strong and sturdy, but since it won't do taller or wider cans, I'm disappointed."
4,seems heavy-duty and durable,Some other crushers seemed a little less durable and this seems to work pretty well. My husband mounted it near the garage door so it's where we need it to crush and save cans.
4,How durable is it?,"I did much research before buying this item. My biggest concern was how long will it last. Durabilty seemed to be the biggest issue of all the crushers I checked out. After several months of use, the crusher got out of alignment and I had to try to fix it myself. It's OK now, but I realize that my fix will only be temporary. When working properly it works very well, but I wonder how long it will last. Due to the basic job that crushers do, durability may be an inherent issue with all of them. With that being said, I did buy 2 more to give as Christmas presents."
2,The cans seem to fly out of the crusher when pulling the handle.,When I was looking for a can crusher this one looked like it would do the job!I installed it in place where I had my oud crusher which I had for years and after using this one the cans seem to fly everywhere and did not crush very easy. I think there is something wrong it the design.
5,Great Gadget,"Sturdy construction, crushes cans easily. I expect this item to last much longer than the flimsy crusher that it replaced."
4,Nice Item,"Shipping was super fast. Crusher itself is a good product.. Only time will tell how it holds up but it seems like a good one. A bit costly considering that many of these things are well under $20 and by the time I was done it was almost $30, but it was for Dad who is happy."
5,Great,This can crusher is working great. The last one I bought did not last 6 months. This one is crushing and much more reliable.
4,Crush like a champ,"Bought this for my grandmother for Christmas, works well. Mounting it was a problem because of the sheer weight of crusher and it would just fall out of the drywall. Recommend mounting it on solid wood."
5,Pacific can crusher,This is exactly what I was looking for. It seems to be a very well built unit and the price seemed good
4,Great but cans slip out!,"I've had this crusher about 6 months. It's mounted outside on a 4 x 4 fence post under our back porch. I mounted it there as this is where my recycling containers are located.(3 color stackable containers also bought here) We discovered very quickly that the bottom edge is quite slippery and the cans come flying out when you try to crush them. I superglued a piece of rubber shelf matting to the bottom and this solved the problem. I noticed elsewhere on here someone recommended either bending up the edge or inserting a screw. I think those are great ideas and add weight to the complaint of cans slipping out of the crusher while being crushed. Great buy, would buy another if the need arises."
5,Works Great,"I have used this product for several weeks and have crushed over 10 pounds of cans with it and have had no problems whatsoever.I have read in other reviews about how the can sometimes pops out and this is true, but it doesn't happen much and when it does, it is easy to put the can back in and get completely crushed on the second try. After you get the hang of it it shouldn't be a problem.It also has a very heavy, sturdy design and has no ""give"" at all when used."
5,coool can crusher,its easier for people who dont want messed up feet when they crush thier cans too much its not good for you so better use this it way out of this world and it does work....
3,Works OK,"Very sturdy but the can can tends to slip out if you do not push down factthe botton where the can sits needs some ""grit"" paint or something like that so it does not slip out when crushing.Easy fix is to pull down quickly"
3,good can crusher,"this a nice sturdy can crusher.i've only used it to crush one trash bag of soda cans,it's good but the handle is too small.for the way it's built it would be nice with a grip like a cycle grip.i will change mine,then it will be better, can't say perfect because i dont know how durable yet,but real good."
4,"Good can crusher, especially for the price.","I was a bit worried about this being a good can crusher, since it was one of the least expensive offered, but it mounted easily (needing to be secured into a stud, of course), and worked great! It seems sturdy, like it will last a long time. We'll see..."
4,Just a minor improvement,"The product works very well. It was a good buy and is very sturdy. the only problem is when crushing cans they sometimes shoot out. the suggestion i read before buying this was to slightly bend up the edge of the plate on which the can sits. i have been unable to get around to doing that but i will. this will help the cans stay in place. other than that, the product works extremely well and effective."
4,Works as described,"The crusher arrived quickly and turned out to be well built and easy to install. Minor issue is that cans sometimes slip out when smashing. A small lip on the top jaw of mechanism might improve an already good product. Small children can operate it and like the noise it makes. Overall, I'm satisfied with it."
4,The Crusher,This can crusher is a very solid and sturdy crusher. It's easy to mount and has a long handle to make crushing any size can easy. My only problem with this product is if you don't hold the cans in until they start crushing sometimes they will fly out on you. This is more of an inconveinance than a problem. Overall. it's a fine product for the cost.
1,The WORST can crusher...,"I've been recycling cans for years now and have used many different crushers. This one is by far the worst. It spits almost every can out long before it actually crushes it. I've tried several different ways (slow, fast, slightly dent the sides first) and nothing helps. I really wish it worked better because it does seem to be well made and I feel like it would last much longer than others I've used, but it's simply not worth having if it doesn't preform."
1,Can Crusher?,"Unfortunately, I did not get instructions for product. I had no idea how to use it, although I did try many times. I couldn't figure it out so I resorted to my old way of smashing cans, with a hammer. It does take more time but it's more efficient.Also, does not work with oil cans or peanut butter glass jars. Full cans are especially difficult to crush, and you may want to wear a rain coat as you'll get very wet."
4,Can Can Crush,"Out of the box probably a 3 out of 5, but thanks to an earlier reviewer a slight mod makes it a 4/5. Bending the bottom lip up greatly reduces the tendency of the cans to jump out of the crusher. With the mod it's doing a fine job."
5,great seller,"fast shipping, item works as described easily crushes cans. may want to dent the cans a little to get it started works very well."
5,Awsome !!,"Heavy duty device in crushing cans. I had a similar one, but very flimsy.I also modified the unit by installing a 3/8"" thick aluminum plate,insidebottom. This gives it more crushing power !!! Shape aluminum plate as designed. Place inside bottom then c clamp to hold. Drill 3 holes(#36)at bottom diamond shape.Remove plate then tap 6-32. Before placing plate back redrill hole to a #29 drill bit for clearance hole. Then use 6-32x3/8 screws. HAPPY CRUSHING,Good Excersise for the ARM."
5,Lives up to its promises,"This crusher is great. It is sturdy, does what it is supposed to, and takes a minimum of effort. I can see me using this for many years to come."
4,The CRUSHER!!!!!!!,Great product. We got this for the office to reduce space in our little recycling center. It also works as a stress-reliever when you're having a rough day. Crushing is fun! The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is that the cans tend to fly out of the thing. I wish there was a little metal bracket to hold the can in place while you're crushing.
4,Single Can Crusher-,"Crushes good, IF you hold can in place, so watch your fingers! Good heavy construction, so hopefully will last many years!"
2,handle breaks,had this thing a few weeks and its well built except for the handle....currently has duct tape holding it together but it continually comes apart...not good for crushing 3 30 packs after a fun filled weekend...there are probably better ones out there
4,can crusher,Works good. But watch out for the can getting ejected during crushing. I put a piece of black tape in the bottom to provide friction and keep the can from flying out.
4,Does the job!,"I've used this can crusher for several months, and it is holding up well and doing a good job. The previous unit I owned, which I purchased at Bed Bath & Beyond,the metal arms became bent and the unit was unusable after only a few weeks use. This unit has a much more sturdy design and is easy to operate. I would definitely recommend it."
4,Good Product,"Works great, seems much stronger than another style that I used to have. I crush quite a few cans with it, and I haven't had a problem yet. The included screws are plenty strong to hold it steady."
4,great crusher except handle,"We have mounted this can crusher to studs in the wall of our garage. It's very sturdy except that the handle kept coming off. My husband added heavy screws to the sides of it, and now it's perfect."
5,Best can crusher made,This is the best can crusher made. It is solid and I have used one for many many years. A couple of drops of oil in the hinge and it will last forever. The solid front keeps liquid from squirting at you.
5,Bills Can Crusher,I use this to recycle all the aluminum drink cans and then take them to be recycled. This can crusher is very durable and sturdy and I have been using it for two years with no problems.
5,Crusher,This a powerful can crusher. It is solidly built and easy to use. The only thing I would recommend to a buyer is to bend the edge up so cans don't pop out.
3,not as described,"I purchased this item after watching the video review here and researching other metal fabricated products. I was specifically looking for something that fit 16 oz cans. Well, not the one I received. Maybe I got a shoddy one. The 16 oz cans have to be squished in there. It is missing 1-2 mm of extra space to enable the can to fit. Also, to wall-mount properly, we had to add a 1/2"" board behind it so the handle could open all the way. It works wonderfully for 12 oz cans though. My metal working bf will have to modify it to make it crush his cans! (essentially bang the x where the cans sit flat with an anvil) It would have gotten more stars if not for those two things. When (not if) the handle comes apart, he should also be able to fix that pretty easily. For $20, not too bad, but not great."
4,Can crusher,"Love this thing. Works so well I bought another one for my Dad. It is a high quality, heavy duty crusher. Every now and then a can will shoot out but if you dent it in the middle before inserting in the crusher this very seldom happens. Very happy with this product and will buy another one if this one ever wears out."
1,Looks great when it works - which isn't often,"Bought one of these puppies for a car trip - very nice screen in the store, nice feature set, reasonable price. Weird controls - volume is via a wheel on the main unit; can't be adjusted using the remote control. Worked great for the first few hours, and then the screen went haywire - everything (including setup screens) gets awful ghost images, all of the colors except yellow disappeared, etc. Tried checking all the setup screens, and reset everything to factory defaults, but it appears to be a hardware failure. Very disappointing to the kids, and to the drivers when it didn't act as a pacifier...The price was reasonable compared to other products in this space, but the quality was awful."
4,Swivel screen is COOL!,"Pros:The swivel screen is very handy. It gives you lots of options for hanging it your vehicle. The player comes with a case specifically designed for hanging on the back of a headrest. Unlike other cases, this one is not bulky, and holds the DVD player flat. I have mine hanging upside down from the sun visor. You can press a button to rotate the image 180.The unit also plays music CDs and MP3 CDs.The battery back attaches to the bottom, so it doesn't interfere with the hinges of the screen. Most other DVD players have the batter in the rear, so you can't open the screen flat.CONS:The 8"" screen looks great, but only from a certain angle. It's not the best for sharing. There were other players in this price range that had better viewing angles, but the convenience of swivel screen made me choose this model.Reliability:So far, everything works."
1,looks good but works bad,"I guess this is the updated model for the dvd player that I have from polaroid the pdv-0800, but it looks like the same crap to me. I had 2 of these dvd players so far, the first one had problems so I sent it back expecting a well functioning product, but instead i recieved another dvd player that worked under par. They both had trouble doing what they are made to do , which is play dvd's. Most of the time the movies I were watching would freeze up during viewing for no apparent reason, and just other problems like a loud clicking noise during fast forwarding. I do not recommend polaroid dvd products at all, they should stick with film."
2,Not Very Focused,"If you were interested in what theological rethinking (presumably Christian) needs to be done in light of the last 25 years of astronomical observations of the visible Universe, you will be disappointed in most of the essays. The introduction to the book says it all about how the essays do not take the astounding facts of the new views of the universe into account: ""Nor does this volume...have any such grandiose ambitions... and the result, while stimulating in itself, demonstrates how much remains to be done."" p. viii of Introduction."
1,Pam and Mike Rogers,This pressure washer turned out to be a dudd. We received the item in April and did not take it out of the box until the summer. It was brought to clean brick and vinyl siding. The machine could not build up enough pressure to even wash a car let along brick or vinyl.
3,A very educative tragic comedy,"As any movie this work targets foremost own locals-and has broadened a foreign reviewer's knowledge of a region if even not so perfectly.A street drug-seller and a good Catholic brother and son of a single mom (on terms of terrorizing a sister from communicating the young males themselves following, actually, his own sex-explorations) was caught and forcedly conscripted into the Venezuelan army, a board protection guard particularly.As he made some usual business at a Colombian side of the boarder and deserted, a funny story of Venezuelan-Colombian affairs on a landscape of environment grounding started, a devoted Colombian soldier-enemy-turned-friend, rebels, gorillas, military, drug syndicates and sex in.Factually, a comedy collapses into a tragedy, and a movie is rather educative than entertaining also sexism ruled."
3,surprisingly good,"I bought this movie because I like Edgar Ramierez. I wasn't expecting it to be so funny. I really like the relationship between the 2 main characters. If you have a problem with subtitles I wouldn't say this is for you, but other wise see it."
2,I tried very hard to like it!,The book is very slow. Just not a lot of action. The idea behind it is good but Paulo Coelho is not one of my favorite writers.
5,Very informative,"Alot of good information in this video, And some really good footage as well. You are learning from a master."
4,Great resource,We use Frommer's books for all our trips. The Denmark book was great. I recommend it.
3,Good for Trip Tips,It's a good guide for you that want some tips on what to see and visit. It could have more hotel options (including the inexpensive...)
2,mows nice till it breaks,"I bought this mower when it first came out, and was happy to spend the extra dough not to have to spill gas and oil, and not to have a cord dragging behind. I used it for about a year and a half than stored it for a while, and when I brought it out of stoarage it worked for about an hour and than just quit, never to run again. I opened it up to see if it was just a short or something easy, and it turns out that in the process of taking the top cover off, the wires are so short it bends the circiut board. I swear they make it like that. Also a friend of mine had one that quit in the same manner, which suggests that there is a trend. When it does mow, it does fairly well, because of the slower blade speed, you have to mow more frequently, if the grass gets to high, it will leave a lot sticking up. All in all I don't think I'm going to buy another one."
5,Savage Garden ROCKS!,"Savage Garden is the only new group out there right now in the 90's who can create good pop music. They do have their unique sound quality and Darren is a born singer. Savage Garden matches some of the other great artists out there such as Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson, and Madonna. Their next album is going to determine whether I can truly call them the Prince's of Pop. I have wanted to call them that because I like almost all of their songs on their first album. I won't call them the Prince's of Pop until I see how this next album is. Well keep up the good work Darren and Daniel. I hope that you eventually have some of the biggest selling records of all time. Bring us into the Millenium with some of the best music that you can create."
5,"Awesome, amazing talent, you can't find a bettter group","I absolutely love these guys! If you really like well written songs, here's a great cd. They really know the words to use to describe exactly how you feel. These guys are incredible. Props to Daz and Dan!"
3,Eh.,"Not exactly the greatest CD I anticpated it to be. I expected really good songs from Savage Garden, because the only ones that I had heard from the radio from them were great ones. But the only songs that I liked were ""I Want You,"" ""Truly Madly Deeply,"" and ""Santa Monica."" The other songs were dull and lifeless. A through disappointment."
3,"Pretty Cool at first sight, but...","Well, I just love ""Truly, Madly Deeply"". But sadly, I consider that this group won't be here in 5 years. They sound a lot like Roxette sometimes. This doesn't mean I don't have the CD..."
2,SOUNDgarden could beat up SAVAGEgarden any day!,"You'd think Savage Garden would be louder and rougher than Soundgarden, huh? Don't let the name reel you into buying the CD. While I'd heard ""Truly Madly Deeply"" on the radio and MTV, I thought their other songs would be better, that maybe it was just a ballad. They weren't, it wasn't. If you like that sort of mushy, make-you-wanna-puke music, I recommend it. I don't even like Soundgarden very much, but I'd happily buy one of their CDs before ever thinking about buying another of Savage Garden's. It's torture for the ears!"
3,This is a good album but needs work.,"This is a very good album but needs better lyrics. Its got good music and I love it but the lyrics aren't worth a dime(except on Truly, madly, deeply.) END"
3,"The Sweet, Catchy and Monotonous.","I thought ""Truly, Madly, Deeply"" was a great song and after I heard a girl in my class praising the cd, I bought it. I was not majorly disappointed but I felt a little let down. I have to give the duo credit for writing and producing their songs and playing instruments. At the time of the cd's release, the Backstreet Boys and the Spice Girls ruled the pop world and Savage Garden did not fall into the boy band craze. The best songs are the slow ones like ""Truly, Madly, Deeply"", ""Universe"", and ""To The Moon & Back"" and also the upbeat ""I Want You"". Savage Garden has sort of an 80's synthesized rock/pop sound meets 90's Europop even though they're Australian. The problem I had was the lack of variety. The songs had the same tone: the main thing that distinguished them was the pace. Also, there were not any suprises. This is a good pop cd and it was different from all the teen pop that was out in '97. I think ""Truly, Madly, Deeply"" will be a classic love song."
3,On a strange ground...,"I'm on a strange ground with this album, since I don't normally care about teen pop hit bands, and I seldom watch MTV. Anyway, I just happened to keep hearing Savage Garden songs on the radio, and after a few months I realised I rather liked them. Truly, Madly, Deeply did wear itself out eventually, but To The Moon And Back was the song that really appealed to me. So what I did was to borrow this album from my friend's little sister. I listened to it a few times just to see if it would me worth something.Well, it is, and it isn't. I've never listened to a whole Backstreet Boys album, but I suppose that would be far worse than Savage Garden. Most of the songs are quite average 80's glitter pop. Melodies are catchy enough, lyrics are not that bad. The single tracks are the three best songs on the album, but that was to be expected. So nothing here to turn me on, mind you, but keep buying Savage Garden if it keeps you away from N'Sync."
4,Wonderfully 'different',"I found this album to be a pleasing, if somewhat eclectic mix of songs. 'Truly Madly Deeply' is a good ballad, and the sound of Savage Garden isof a somewhat different approach to music than so many other insipid bands. I feel, though, that their music is greater appreciated when one reads the trilogy of novels by Anne Rice-- the Vampire Chronicles. The moody 'Carry on Dancing' takes on new meaning in the light of the knowledge that it is inspired by the savage yet genttelmanlyvampires of her tales. Then we have 'To the Moon and Back', which, although not explicitly about these tales, can never fail to remind me of Lestat's strange yet powerful character. That it actually aspires to literature rather than mindless phrases like 'I can't live without you, babe'... (cf. Countless Boy-Bands) is surely inspiration enough!"
4,a great cd,this is a great cd but if you really like the music buy the imported version cause it has even more songs on it
3,It's Alright,"The CD is okay. Not much else to say but that. Except that ""Truly, Madly, Deeply"" is way overplayed, and I'm SICK OF IT! They shuold play ""I Want You"" more because it's a better song."
4,Okey-dokey!,This CD is amazing. I love the techno sound and the upbeat rythyms. I recommend this CD to anyone and everyone who has any taste in music.
5,Savage Garden is the Best,"I totally love Savage Garden. without this CD i would probably die. Truly Madly Deeply is my favorite song of all and is only the reason i listen to MUSIC. You should buy this cd, you won't be sorry."
1,Gets old quick,"Soundgarden was better, since their singles weren't played on the radio time and time again. I got this CD, loved it for a week, and then the radio station started broadcasting them OVER and OVER again!!! Argh! Perhaps if all their songs didn't sound the same I'd like it better..."
1,There is only one fairly good song.,I think song is not worth the cd it is recorded on. The CD starts out good but after only a few days the CD gets annoying as HE11.
5,Music to love to,"Nostalgia got me one afternoon and I had to listen to the songs I use to listen to when I was younger. I used to swoon at the sound of Darren Hayes' voice and suddenly craved that sound again. I'd given my CD to a friend as a gift though, so I had to buy it again. I'm so glad I did.The debut album of Savage Garden is by far their best. From ""I Want You"", a great song to dance to, to ""Tears of Pearls"" a song that may pull on your heart strings. They cover every emotion and pull some new ones from you.If you haven't heard this CD yet, you need to."
4,This is a good CD!,"I liked this CD, it was pretty good. However, there is a song that I think Savage Garden sings, but i am not sure. I think it is called ""Cherry Cola."" If anyone has any idea about where i can get this song, please e-mail me or tell me in the review that you write for this CD. Thanks. GOOD CD!"
3,Australian = GB + American Pops,"Australian bands are usually rooted in rock'n roll. Savage Garden is no exception. The music is a melting pot of British and American pops. ""To the Moon & Back"" and ""I Want You"" are Europop rocks under strong influence of Roxette. The No. 1 hit that slashed through billboard ""Truly Madly Deeply"" is a successful concoction of British-American pop. ""Tears of Pearls"" is a formulaic dance beat of the 80s, yet spices up the album through adding a unique music element. ""Promises"" and ""Santa Monica"" are sugar-coated ballad especially for teenage fans. If you look for big surprises and breakthrough, go elsewhere. If you simply want great mainstream pop, Savage Garden is the choice."
5,The music of my dreams.,"I could never have imagined what this CD had instore for me when I first placed it into my CD player. The music is the most incredible I have ever heard. From the amazing ballad ""To The Moon And Back"" to the catchy dance grooves of ""I Want You"" and ""Tears of Pearls."" Never to be forgotten, ""A Thousand Words"", this song has incredible meaning to me. I could go on and on about how much the music on this disc has changed my life, but I would much rather see people buy it and keep Darren Hayes(26) and Daniel Jones(25) shining forever in the world of music."
5,A great cd,"I bought the cd for the first three songs (To the Moon and Back, I Want You, and Truly Madly Deeply) and was pleasantly surprised to find the other tracks were better. I definitely recommend it."
4,very cool!!!!!!!!!,"This CD is sooo cool it's one of the best CD's I own even though it's pop, The reason I said that is because I dont really like pop though this CD is definitly an exception I origanally bought it for Truly Madly Deeply, but I found lots of other amazing tracks like To The Moon And Back, Santa Monica, A Thousand Words, And Carry On Dancing wich is very cool, and creepy combined."
5,The Best,"This is the best CD! Truly, Madly Deeply is the most beautiful song. I cry whenever I hear it. I love this CD, Truly Madly, and Deeply."
2,Songs for poetic losers in love,"Savage Garden. What can one say? Their crafted pop has made an impact on Top 40 countdowns the world over, yet many people outside Australia struggle to identify them when asked.Lead singer Darren Hayes tries too hard to be a great wordsmith; when one word will do, he instead uses a slew of them. Even then, his 'meaningful' messages are obscured. The sound of the CD is clean and almost too clinical. If you can get over the anachronistic touches of 80's synth pop, this CD will suit you fine.The dripping wet 'Truly Madly Deeply' looks certain to be the most played song at weddings into the 21st century. And a beautiful, affecting single it is too, but there are too few highlights here to make it worth your while. On the whole, not a bad effort, but is it worth your money?"
1,Nah!!,This CD was hyped up to be a great one but it wasn't at all! Two good songs and that was about it! What a dud =(
1,Savage Sucks,"Unfortunately, this is a band that has tons of potential but doesn't know how to use it. Lead singer Darren Hayes sounds and looked like a woman. Instrumentalist Daniel Jones has talent but has to be stuck with that dweeb. Do yourself a favor, buy a real CD and don't waste your money on these one-hit-wonders."
1,IMPORTANT: this does not represent Australian music,Savage Garden are one of the worst bands of all time
1,Syrupy Pap,"Truly a band out of it's time, bland pop of the Roxette school, middle aged married women may like it. It made me want to vomit."
5,Great Tunes,"My husband bought me this cd because I liked the hit ""Truly, Madly, Deeply,"". After hearing it all , I love the entire cd!!! Rarely do you find a cd you can put in and listen from beginning to end, this is one of them....."
5,Beautiful blend of old and new melodies for today's listener,"The musical talent is superb. The blend of old and new melody lines are used to put the listener in mind of music from all modern Rock. This album should skyrocket, and also be a keeper for true music lovers."
5,IT IS MORPHINAMICAL..IT IS THE BEST CD IN THE UNIVERSE,ITS THE BEST CD MADE IN THE USA...I LIKE THEIR CD AND IT GIVES THE MEANING TO THE WORD MUSIC..THE BAND DID A FANTASIC JOB ON THIS CD AND I HOPE..I HOPE THEY WILL HAVE ANOTHER ONE COMING SOON..I ..I NEVER HEARD SUCH..SUCH BBBBEAUTIFUL..SONGS IN MY ENTIRE LIFE...!!!!!KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK ..SAVAGE GARDEN!!!
5,Haven't stopped playing it on my computer!,"Yes! After hearing this CD, I had to find out more about Savage Garden! It's really good (the CD) and I especially love 'Santa Monica'. Even when I'm not doing anything on my computer I still play it!"
3,3 1/2 stars,"This is not some overproduced peace of junk, that has been on the airwaves, like the boy bands of late. The songs are catchy, and quite good. I Want You, Truly Madly Deeply, and Break Me Shake Me, are all great songs. Rest of the cd holds it's own. Not a bad debut. Look forward to more from them."
5,kirby's review,"savage garden's debut album is, in my opinion, the best to haveever been created. The words are extremely intense and no matter what your going through in life or what your mood is that day, you can somehow relate to the emotions expressed by Darren'swords. My favorite song is ""To The Moon and Back,"" i listen to this track almost everyday (for four years now), and it feels new everytime. I enjoy all hte other tracks also, ""Break/Sheak Me"" is #2 for me. I am very picky about my music, I must hear 3-4 songs off a cd before i buy it...i bought sg's cd and have never regreted the decision. GO BUY IT!!! It is worth the money!"
5,Indescribable... absolutely brilliant,"Exactly what it says. It's absolutely amazing how the talent of these two young men could reflect so greatly in music with true soul and meaning in it, the songs to fit a mood of any type, whether energetic, dark and gothic, soothing or even sensually romantic. I especially admire the song ""To the Moon and Back,"" in a sense that it is incredibly beautiful and to any music fan would capture their heart, as well as nearly all of the other songs. I may be 18 years old but who says I can't be obsessed! Wonderful job Darren Hayes (with your voice from heaven) and Daniel Jones (truly a melodic wonder). Supremacy of music."
5,SAVAGE GARDEN is actually a perfect 10 rating,"This CD is one of my all time favorites. Truly,Madly,Deeply is the song that belongs to my boyfriend and I, He picked it out. To me, he is all of the things described in the song. He is the one who changed my life foralways and ever. This one's for you Scotty, and thank you Savage Garden for recording a song that meets our feelings for each other. ;)"
5,"Good job, guys.","I like the two songs ""To the moon and back"" and ""Truly madly deeply"" the best. You are the best, especially Daniel"
5,This album is GREAT!!!,I fell in love with all the songs in this album the moment I bought it. It's worthwhile listening to it. Grab it now if you have not!!!!
5,It's awesome!!,"I think Savage Garden deserves more credit than they get. Their CD is great! Darren and Daniel are truly talented. Some people say they only have a few ""good"" songs. But all the songs have a significance and a deeper meaning. Just listen to them closer and see how inspiring they can be."
5,This group is so talented. . .it's an awesome CD!!,Savage Garden is my favorite group. I listen to their CD all the time!! This CD is a great mix of different moods; no matter how you're feeling there's always a song for you. It is great for anyone interested in good quality music with a great beat. I never want to turn it off!!
1,My one star rating is very generous.,"This CD will go into my collection of one hit wonders. I bought the CD for the hit single ""Truly, madly, deeply"", which is easy listening, not a classic, but the rest of the cuts are really awful. Outdated, super sweet and non original. The lead singer sounds a lot like the lead singer from the 80's band, Breathe, and the music sounds a lot like their stuff too. I will be very surprised if this group is around in 5 years."
1,deserves no stars,depeche mode rip-off with soul replaced by unending sell-out bubblegum. vomit-inducing
4,DEBUT ALBUM IS A POP PINNACLE OF SUCCESS.,"The Australian based band came out a few years ago with their selftitled debut album, and what a splash.A group who knows how to write hooks, and show that each pop song can be different from the next, Savage Garden shows they have originality and imagination.With songs like ""I Want You"", ""To The Moon & Back"" and the dance crazed ""Tears of Pearls"" this CD has it all.The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because of sappy ballads like ""Truly Madly Deeply"" which went to #1, and continued their success into mundane pop trash like ""I Knew I Loved You"", ""Animal Song"" and ""Crash & Burn""Other great songs on this CD are ""Carry On Dancing"", ""Violet"" and the rock infectious ""Break Me Shake Me"".If you don't have either Savage Garden CD, take their debut over their poor sophomore effort ""Affirmation""."
1,Savage Garden=crap,"I feel it is necessary to state my opinion of Savage Garden's 'music', since I believe that they have been given too much credit by the media. First of all, the music itself is dull, unimaginative, and redundant. It is mostly synthesized and over-produced. The lyrics are of extremely poor quality, again hardly creative or thought-provoking. ie; 'You'll have to dodge those inline skaters, or they'll knock you down'. The singer's voice I find particularly irritating, ranging from high-pitched whines to...high-pitched whines. The album itself is quite short. It is mostly technical. The songs range from slow, sugar-covered ballads to cheesy attempts at dance/pop. Savage Garden's music is not intellegent, influencial, or creative in any way. In short, I believe this album is a complete waste of money."
1,This review can be summed up in three words- One Hit Wonder.,This review can be summed up in three words- One Hit Wonder
1,Wannabe Scritti Politti,You can tell that this group played the death out of their Scritti Politti albums in the 80's. They are so unoriginal and they are vocal theives.
5,lyrics....,"i thought the lyrics to most of the songs on the cd were wonderful. there are some that were blah (ex.)truly madly deeply (has beautiful background but after the first 3 or 4 times hearing it, it becomes romantic sh*t), i want you and violet. the rest are really great. especially promises, santa monica (which reminds of the ambiguity of chats on the net), universe and, tears of pearls. my fav is a thousand words. i loved the lyrics to the song. i liked it is 'cause it agrees with my philosophy. i suppose that if it hadn't i might not like it as much as i do, but it DOES. to me the lyrics're true. there have been reviews on here that say their lyrics suck...well it's mostly what you choose to associate to them.by the way if ya like savage you might like dream theater..."
3,Nice catchy melodies but not very original lyrics,"I don t dislike Savage Garden, I think they are fun to listen to when you do not want to think too much or just feel like dancing. Not a bad CD, but certainly not one of my all time favorites (I prefer old stuff by Tears For Fears and Depeche Mode)."
5,excellent!!!!!!!!!!,"This is absolutely the best CD I have ever bought!! I play it non-stop in my stereos. There aren't any bad songs in that CD. I recommend everybody who likes for instance truly, madly, deeply to buy this CD."
3,Savage Garden - more than expected,"I thought that Savage Garden had only two good songs, but I have to admit that I was quite surprised by the good rythym of the remaining songs."
3,Savage Garden,"`Savage garden' is the excellent self titled debut from this now broken up band. Offering a slice of inoffensive pop with some decent song writing and catchy tunes. The album opener ` To The Moon and Back' is my particular favourite, but this band is probably more well known for the ballad `Truly Madly Deeply' which is another great song. This flits between more upbeat songs and ballads and although I prefer the upbeat stuff, the gentler stuff is also great and works well in the evening as back ground music. It was a shame that this band never fulfilled the promise of this first album and although this is very much `of it's time', it also offers some good music and is worth a listen if you're a fan of the aforementioned tracks.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
5,savage garden rocks,this cd is so good. like everyone i know loves savage garden and has their own favorite song from this album from them--- there are so many good songs everbody has a different favorite song. i remember when i first met my roommate this was the only cd in her collection that i approved of. now everytime a savage garden song comes on the radio we just blast it up!
4,Dunhill Droooone,"I gotta hand it to you first Mike, I've been bumpin this in my ride fo weeeks..Mr. Boo did it again.. with his first solo release ""dunhill drone commitee"", he pushed the levels even higher.. All the sounds and instruments were cut and scratched using a turntable, records and mixer... scracting as we like to call it.It starts out with the mellow indian vibe and then rolls off into a journey of diffrent genres.. A must have for anybody interested in turntablism and instrumental beats...Also check outScetchbook by Mike Boo and Ricci RuckerFuga by Ricci RuckerPhantazmagorea by D-Styles"
5,I am a clog wearer and these are the best,"I have to wear certain shoes because I have had two broken feet which had to be repaired with screws. There are very few shoes that I can really wear...until I found Clark's. These Clogs are the best and are very comfortable. I have had no foot pain whatsoever. I think I am buying these in almost every shade (I have 5 pairs of the Indigo clogs to date).I wear these with anything from dress trousers to jeans. I have worn them with skirts, too, even dressier ones although I admit I don't need to wear strict business attire to work the way others do which is an advantage for me.If I can wear these comfortably with my foot difficulties, I know that they will work for others. You have to like the ""clog"" fit, however. If you are the high heel pump type, these may not be for you."
4,They feel very comfortable and very light and supportive!,"I love the look of this pair of clog in both black and bamboo. They are also very comfortable and light weighted. They certainly look good with jeans. I wear them with anything else, too! The only concern I have is they seem to be smaller than the true 6M. I usually can wear a 6M shoes with socks, but with this, it's a bit too tight to do so. Other than that, they are great!"
2,Comfort,"I live in clogs, these are not comfortable. They have a weird arching that makes my feet ache. I can wear them for a short while, but not a walk or all day. Clark's is usually VERY comfy...disappointed."
1,Inedible Popcorn,"GOLIGHTLY Sugar-Free Caramel Popcorn, 2.5 Ounces (Pack of 12)I ordered this product and 95% of each bag, I tried two, were inedible. The popcorn was hard and almost broke a tooth. I felt cheated and struggled to taste the caramel. When I checked on my order to return it, I was told it was not returnable."
5,Sugar free popcorn that tastes like the real thing.,I eat GOLIGHTLY Sugar-Free Caramel Popcorn every night as my snack. I find it to be quite satisfying and it fills my craving for sweets. The bag size (2.5 Ounces) is the perfect size.
4,Great ladder !,"Great ladder. I dropper one star because of the weight. Aside from that you will not find a better made, more stable platform to work from. Inside weight is not a problem, but outside in soft ground it can be a handful to move around. I have never felt safer than on this ladder. Kinda expensive, but you get your moneys worth."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this book very enthusiastically and with the best expectations after I loved so much the first installment of the series, thus the harsh disappointment. The story is very shallow, the characters' development lacks in depth. The narration goes on and on, too often repeating the same situations and the same mental looping of the main characters. No, this novel never managed to capture my interest, and I had to force myself to finish the read."
5,Outstanding imagery,Loved the imagery. Best imagery I have ever experienced. The book was so well written and it made me want to read all of the books.
4,Loved it,I really enjoyed the story line and the characters! It was not always predictable as many other stores can be.
3,Effective repetitive,"For an 80's Glass work, the thrust on this infatuated rhythmic scheme is admirably engaging. Opposed to even earlier, practically primitive works Maelstrom keeps things relatively fresh and flowing throughout the extended affair. While not possessing the production grace to completely mask a certain melodic redundancy, Glass shines nonetheless, if ever for working profoundly with the little he had. An interesting aside is how Muse seem to play with this format briefly on the lead-off track of their last studio release."
3,Realmente pobre,"Para la profundida y desarrollo de cada trabajo que ha alcanzado un compositor como Philip Glass, considero que este trabajo esta por debajo de su nivel.Si tuviera que catalogarlo en una sola palabra, podría definirlo como ""insipido"". No se termina de entender que quiere hacer el compositor con esta obra, ni que quiere dar a significar. Pudiera entonces hablarse de que logró captar muy bien lo que siginifica un ""Maelström"", pero a mi parece ni eso me queda claro."
2,insipid,"Philip Glass didn't create anything new with this cd. He's not one of the most famous living composers because he's one of the greatest -- I guess just because he's one of the most accessible amidst all the brilliant creative innovation of the 20th & 21st centuries (which he did play an important role in, granted, 30 years ago). This cd is so boring to me. The swirling effect of arpeggiation is appropriate to the theme, & Mr Glass probably thought he was being so superbly minimalistic by isolating just that as the compositional element for almost all the music, but it sounds like it could have been made in as long as the cd lasts by absent-mindedly holding down a few keys on a keyboard with the arpeggiation button on. I think this is probably not music for one with an ear for composition. If you do like it, don't worry about me."
3,Great lecture... bad recording,"This one was done at Harvard; having heard his other lectures and other lectures released by Alternative Tentacles Records this is a disappointment. The content and track listing is great, but you can hear the microphone peeking (as it does before feedback comes). I currently work at a college doing live audio and let me say that this should be either remastered or just plainly re-recorded. As for the lecture, Chomsky, the great leftist has done it again telling people what is wrong with corporations is the fact that corporations are greedy, out-for-their-own evil purposes, and need to be abolished. I enjoy ALL his books and readers (even the works he merely edits)."
4,there must be a bad batch of cd's ...,I've returned it and the replacement copy has the same problem - skipping. It skips so badly that it really is unlistenable.The parts I could listen I enjoyed very much.
5,Chomsky at his best,"While Noam Chomsky has written many books on both politics and linguistics, he is at his best during interviews or speeches. Chomsky has a talent for making complicated, intellectual issues accessible to the listener (or reader of his interviews.) This CD focuses on capitalism and it's flaws."
4,"great boots, great service","I ordered these boots from Amazon and they came in perfect condition. The box was not crushed and looked clean and new, the boots were wrapped in tissue paper to protect the leather. I love these boots and have been wearing them almost daily for the past 2 months. They just get better with age! I'll be adding more Frye boots to my collection in the coming years!"
4,Size seems to run small,"The quality of these Frye boots was excellent as expected. However, in most shoes I easily fit into 10.5 W or E/EE. I could not even get these boots onto my foot. They do seem to run a ""tad"" small. I have re-ordered a whole size larger and I'm hoping :) They really are very nice boots. Great look, very nice quality. Patience required with online ordering I suppose ... :)"
4,"Great Boots, Get the right socks","These boots fit great and look amazing. The only thing is if you are going on any long walks, make sure you have the right socks to prevent blisters. They fit a little snug, but are otherwise fantastic."
5,Great Boots,"Awesome boots. Had Frye boots in the late 80s and loved them. In the meantime I bought a lot of biker boots for riding and forgot about Frye. Saw them on Amazon, bought them and now I remember why I love them back then. They fit fantastic and are comfortable as can be. First day i had them on was on the bike for 8 hrs and nothing did hurt. The quality is outstanding and I am happy i have Frye boots again"
4,Motorcycle Boots,"I bought these for my motorcycle, as an all-season pair of riding boots. Leather and stitching are high quality. Been wearing about a year, no problems. Not very comfortable with supplied inserts, but that goes for almost all footwear. Would recommend this brand, and this particular boot for someone who wants something to ride in, that looks good, but is not expensive."
4,Some boots,"Have been wanting a pair or Frye harness boots forever, just recently found out they made them in wide sizes. They fit pretty true to size, have decent arch support, and feel like armor on your feet. The leather is heavy and can be a little warm in the summer. My only real complaint is that the toe is REALLY squared off. Almost unfashionable. Still, all in all, very good boots made in America."
3,Forewarned,"These are probably the most beautiful boots that I've ever laid eyes on! The leather is spectacular, the gaucho is absolutely gorgeous, and wide is for once properly identified! Problem: DO NOT BUY THESE BOOTS IF YOU HAVE A HIGH ARCH OR WIDE CALF! They will not fit properly! Also, the 12r is literally almost 12 full inches above the harness so you better be long legged and the harness portion does not give at all when sliding foot into place so be ready to fight for what you want to wear....and don't be surprised if it doesn't fit exactly right. I'd suggest tracking down a retailer with the closest possible version to try on before buying."
5,Wonderful Product!,I bought these for my husband. He loves them. They are very comfortable and beautiful. We both love them and saved at least $40.00 using Amazon.Thanks for another great purchase!
3,This is (NOT) BAD!!!,"I originally posted, ""I laughed so hard that I fell off my chair... and that was from the album cover alone, I hadn't even heard the first track yet! Artistic value = 0, comedic value = 5"" But you know what, now that I've listened to it a few times, I'm actually starting to like the Taeschner boys' sound. If you're looking for something different in your music library, this might be just the ticket!"
1,This Pressure Washer is a DOG!,"I purchased this pressure washer and was very disappointed. I put alot of faith in the PM magazine review.This pressure washer would have trouble blasting the icing off a cake! It's way underpowered. Given it's size and weight I can only assume that instead of a powerful pump there might just be bricks inside the case.I bought the Karcher M397, it's smaller, less money, but it puts out more power. STAY AWAY FROM THE AR EXTREME. You will be Extremely disappointed."
1,Short Term Life on Machine,"After waiting for this machine for about 5 weeks, it finally arrived. I was very excited and started to use it immediately.After about one hour it stopped working. It continues to pop the circut breaker on the plug. I guess it is defective,so tomorrow I am going to UPS and return the product. It works OK when it works,but one hour is not enough....I think I will buy a machine I can have in a matter of days,not weeks..Sorry, not a happy camper..Richard"
1,Arrived busted,Was shipped quickly. Box had no damaged but when I took the unit out the hard plastic case was clearly damaged. It was cracked and pieces were laying in the box. The plastic piece used to wrap the cord around was broken off and the section where you attached the handle looked like somebody hit it with a big hammer and knocked a hole it it. Had to have been done at the factory. Terrible quality control. Amazon accepted the return.
4,Popular Mechanics reviewed,"Popular Mechanics rates this unit in the July 2003 edition. It gives it the highest out of six rated. Rated againist Karcher,Campbell Hausfeld, Cam Spray, MI-T-M and Porter Cable. I do not own this unit, but will soon because of the PM rating. This unit is also listed as the Black and Decker PW1500 and the Delta DT1600E. CHECK IT OUT."
4,Yeah Winter!,"This short addition to the Mu330 archives is full of Wintery fun. Though some of the songs are quite depressing (not nearly as silly as previous releases) it still has some holiday cheer. The last song 'Gerry's Down Home Christmas' Leaves one a nice warm feeling, where as 'I got this neighbor' is just wacky!"
4,"Nice shirt.,a little basic.","This shirt is really cool but it states in the description that there is a print on the back also.That is not the case.Also,the design is a lttle more dull than I expected and the Fear Factory name is tiny and on the very bottom of the sleeve by your wrist.By the photos in the listing it looks like it runs the length of the other sleeve.Don't get me wrong,I wear this shirt like crazy because the design on the front and on the one sleeve is awesome and Archetype was FF's best album.Another thing is that it is a very thin shirt.I actually love the shirt but I was a bit surprised by how it looked vs. the pictures."
4,High Fashion Fun!,High fashion and the rich meets Jolie Goodman. A good-girl who loses her real estate job and finds herself selling shoes at Neiman's in Atlanta. From there her boyfriend goes missing and to help solve the mystery Jolie and her friends crash high class parties to get some answers.A cute and funny romantic mystery. Made me laugh a few times but also wonder how she gets herself into certain situations a few times. The only real problem I had with the book was the author constantly mentioning people wetting their lips.I received this book when it was offered for free. But I would have been fine spending money on it. I think it's worth a few bucks. It's not a super short story like a lot of mysteries tend to be.No graphic sex or murder scenes.
4,Good book,"This book has humor, suspense and romance!Once I started reading I could not put it down. This was worth reading."
2,Nothing to grab you,"There was nothing wrong with this book. There weren't many glaring typographical errors. It was a but slow but with an unexpected twist at the end. But there was nothing entertaining about it either. It was a mystery with an interesting resolution. However, I didn't find myself trying to figure it out; I just waited for it to be revealed. As for humor, I must have missed it. Glad I got to try it for free. Now I know not to waste time or money on other works by this author."
4,Good Read!,"The characters were believable, funny, vulnerable, interesting. The story line kept you guessing and the twist at the end was a surprise."
3,Good not great,"Not my favorite book by this author. But still a fun, easy read. Would have been perfect for the beach!! I enjoyed mystery part but found the love story to be a little predictable."
3,Where was the humor?,"Maybe I have a strange sense of humor, but I would not use humorous to describe this story. I enjoyed the story and found the plot intriguing and the ending very unexpected, but somehow missed the humor."
3,Party crashers,"Enjoyed easy reading, good to read if you want to know how to crash a party, surprise ending on who the killer was"
4,Enjoyed this one,"Was an entertaining read. Although not terribly thought-provoking, it was funny at times, and held my interest. It's an easy read."
4,Romance/mystery,"Some of the characters in this book drove me a little crazy, maybe because I am such a ""follow the rules"" person but it was a good book with a nice mystery thrown into the romance."
5,Before you go,A story that pulls you in and and had me laughing out loud. Couldn't put down until the end. Stephanie Boyd is a great writer I discovered with Before You Go. Definitely recommend.
4,Very entertaining,"Ms Bond does it again. Her books have it all. A little humour, romance,mystery and mayhem. I like her uncomplicated style."
4,Well written,"This is the second Stephanie Bond book I have read. I enjoyed the local flavor, with all the locations that I am very familiar with. It is a pretty good read, but not as good as ""Our Husband""."
5,books to keep,"I really loved this book. I cannot put down anything she writes until it is finished. I also cannot wait to read the next book in the series. Ehen is the next body movers coming out, I have all of the current ones?"
3,Cute book,"Entertaining and sometimes funny, this book targets readers who like to shop in expensive sores. The ending is less credible. than the preceding chapters, but who cares? A cute book, it takes not much more time to read than a flight from Houston to Dallas."
3,Decent book,"Fun to read, and I liked the fact that it was a light mystery. But I have to admit I was a little stressed out. I could identify with the main character but she was easily talked into situations that couldn't end well."
3,Promiscuous Story,There was too much sex and sexual innuendoes throughout the book. The main characters did outrageous things thatwere not true to life. The male character was forever coming to the rescue of the female main character. This wasnot portrayed in a realistic way. I believe the story was geared to a younger crowd ( 20's to 30's). I do not recommendthis book to anyone older.Ttis book had too much sex and sexual innuendoes throughout. It is probably geared to a younger crowd. The main character
3,Head character was weak,"She was so different from me, that it was hard to get into her mind. She weakly went along with unethical behavior."
4,Fun Read,"This is a great book to read on the plane or relaxing at the beach. If you enjoyed her Body Movers books, you'll enjoy this one."
2,Unbelievably boring!,"I was so disappointed with this book. I did not find it to be at all suspenseful, and the romance was surface at best. I found the characters to be flat and unlikable."
4,A Stephanie bond fix,"Cute, fun, gives you more perspective on some of her recurring characters. A good read for commuters. Good story line"
4,Before Body Movers,Stephanie Bond is a great author. I have read some of her books before. I want to read this book before I started her series. It was great enjoyable read.
5,"Just the beginning to an awesome, captivating & thrilling series.","Like all of Bond's books, on the edge of your seat with the turn of every page. For older teens."
3,A fun quick read.,"A fun and lightly romantic mystery quick read. If you love designer clothing and accessories, throw in crashing high society parties and a missing boyfriend with questionable actions, then this is the book for you. It was enjoyable enough that I might give the second in the series a go."
4,"Thanks, Stephanie","This book was hard to put down and kept me on the edge of my seat! The characters were really enjoyable, I didn't know what they would do next."
3,Pretty good,Not her best but I did enjoy reading it. I couldn't get rid of the anxiety that something was going to happen to the clothes at each of the parties. But I will keep reading her books.
4,Fun read,"First time I have read Stephanie Bond, light fun read. Will read more of her books now. Written at a good pace and lots of laughs."
3,Cute!,"A little slow in parts, but still a great read. Fun characters and the mystery definitely made me want to keep reading!"
2,A Letdown,"I quickly picked up this book when I saw it was another Stephanie Bond. I have really enjoyed her books in the past. In this book, however, I was never on board with the romance piece. It seemed rushed and poorly formed. Hope the next book is better."
3,Easyread,"Easy read, definitely left me wanting more from this author. Was DRY AT points and the constant questioning and questioning herself (main character) kind of annoyed me but overall good book."
5,Good book,"Not as predictable as everyone said, very good read. Definitely a fan!! Would recommend this anyone who likes to read."
4,this pleases me ^_^,"I read this back in middle school, which probably wasn't appropriate considering the sex scenes, but this book is fantastic. I found the plot quite riveting and at times very disturbing, feeling intensely the stress of not being able to control one's own actions while under the influence of nanomachines. It's not very well known, which surprises me considering how vigorously I read this novel."
2,"It's been done before, it's been done better.","Normally I'm a big DeChancie fan, and I give much praise for the fun-to-read ""Castle"" books, but ""Innerverse"" was a lame attempt at future distopia that's been done before and been done better. If you're looking for frightening futuristic government take over, try 1984 by Orwell. DeChancie tries to throw in a twist by using nanotech as his instrument of subjugation, but it was just another means to the same end, and weakly utilized throughout the book. Nanotech, like distopia, has been done before and been done better. To top it all off, John throws in a little romance that's cliche all the way. If anything, this book is less than the sum of its pathetic parts."
4,"cute movie, OK extra disk","we enjoy the movie. It would have gotten 5 stars if the extra DVD had more on it...there are two short movies about the other characters, but I really expected a little more on that 2nd DVD. Maybe another short movie, extended/deleted scenes.....a little more. Cute though, worth getting."
3,GREAT but disapointed...,"I thought I was getting a two movie deal but that was not the case. Madagascar 2 was great. My 2 year and I have have watched it SEVERAL times, lol. I thought the penguins was another movie but it was not! That part was dissapointing. Buy Madagascar by all means but you can stay away from the penguins."
3,Cute videos but not like the first one,Yes we all know sequels are not as good as the first one but this sequel wasn't too bad. It doesn't keep my kids attention as much as the first one does but still cute. I was disappointed that they tried to throw in a love story. The movie is for kids not us. The penguins DVD is cute with a couple of episodes not a full length movie so don't fool yourself to think that you are getting two movies for the price of one. Oh! check out the music videos too. They re-worked the move-it move it song. My daughter likes the original video. I think these are worth owning but the original is viewed a lot more in my house.
2,madagascar 2,"To make it short and sweet, Madagascar 2 was disappointing at best. After the first one I was wondering where they could go with this second release. It would appear that they chose to go nowhere. There was one or two chuckles during the movie and that would just about sum it up. The extra money you pay for the Penguin shorts was a waste."
2,Not half as good as the first movie.,"The Penguins of Madagascar was by far better than the Madagascar 2 movie because it was funnier. I was BOARD during the M2 movie because there was too much talking and not enough gags like the first. I definitely RECOMMEND ""The Penguins of Madagascar""."
1,don't bother buying this for the 2nd CD,I bought the two DVD Set hoping I'd be able to enjoy the Penguins again. The 2nd DVD was entirely misrepresented. About the best I can do is to give it to my five-year-old niece.
4,Love the penguins!,"I'm not a big ben stiller fan, but these movies are ok, my son loves them! Its different from the first, and there are more penguins! I like the 2nd disk with the bouns penguins."
3,Everyone love penguins!,"Especially if they're diabolical, mischievous penguins. Personally, I'm not a big fan of the Madagascar series, but my girlfriend loves it. I can't really get into the characters. But such is life. 3 stars for me, 5 stars for her. Averages out to 4 stars. Also, the penguins extra disc really wasn't necessary. There isn't much on it, and they probably could've fit all the contents onto one disk. Seems to me like they just produced the extra disk to justify charging us more. -1 star."
4,"A nasty place to visit,and I wouldn't want to live there!","This is a good campaign city for those who like a city that's not just an excuse to go shopping or training.This city is nasty enough that a dungeon will seem relaxing afterwards.The noble,preists and merchant factions are all at each others throats and somebody as honest as a paladin wouldn't last long before being sent to the sacrificial altar-low level nobodies should stay home!The vault of the drow and drow of the underdark would help you to expand on this setting because it's a little heavy on politics and a little light on new magic.A fold out campaign map would have been nice as well,though the smaller maps do make it easier to fit this product into an ongoing campaign."
3,About what you'd expect,"Pamela hams it up for the camera. One gets the distinct feeling she knows it is going to be her best filmed performance, which it is. Tommy is a aged lame rocker whose eyes roll back in his head a lot. Not really worth the money."
1,Pam & Tommy Lee Uncut,seller offered to help in completing the transaction- he said item would arrive in 3-5 days. It wasn't until I threatened him with reaching out to Amazon did the tape show up 2 weeks later. Also this wasn't the orginal tape that was found on the 2 of them having sex. This tape was altered. the sex scenes weren't as complete as the orginal bootleg tape that was being circulated.
1,Pamela Anderson & Tommy Lee uncensored (vhs),"It was like a boring home movie with a few brief, difficult to see badly framed sex shots. It was almost unwatchable."
3,Not that great,"Ok, I am a huge Tom Petty fan, but this interview is one you can skip. The sound quality is not that great and the interview is pretty lame."
4,"Good phone, nice design","this phone looks very nice,with good rubber on the sides so it does not slip. it also looks sleek and doesn't have antennas which is a plus for me. reception quality is great. one star off is due to the batteries running out quickly. i've been getting new ones every 1.5 years or so since they tend to die and lose its charge. other than that, i have no issues with this phone."
5,Great for all levels of cooking,"I got this six years ago as a bachelor who had barely touched a stove. One of my first cookbooks, the ""One Dish"" cooking is what was appealed to me. The instructions are easy to follow and the dishes range from very basic to expert. This does have a lot of casserole and stew variations. However, I found quite a few surprises one would not normally think of and it does not stick to Americana cuisine. There is Latin, Asian, European and Middle eastern as well. Chapters are broken down by meat, and course and includes a great one for desserts. Basic cook and bakewear required and a few spices outside the norm is all you need to get the full enjoyment out of this book. Still one of my favorite cookbooks."
3,"Interesting theme, but...","As a Civil War buff, I thought the concept of focusing on the lives of fourteen major figures in the war would be original and a unique addition to my library. Unfortunately, the cursory writing and loose editing reminded me of the Classic Comics of my youth...flashy but not to be kept on the bookshelf. The lives of the ""fourteen"" and their impact on the post-Civil War era are given only a once-over-lightly, and little is included in the book that has not been reported by other authors in more substantive and definitive texts."
4,Simply Fun,"Yinsh was a game I ordered on a whim and I am glad I did. Upon opening it up the first thing you notice is how sturdy all the pieces are. the box is super tough, so is the board and the hard plastic pieces. The game doesn't have a rich theme like most board games but it is still super fun and really engrossing. The strategy is a little shorter than chess but its still present."
1,"Nice try, HACKS","Not only do they go out and rip off the name of a very good Death Metal band, but they pass off the garbage they play for ""music""?! I think not! Just look at the album cover and you get a general idea of what the excrement of the MTV generation produces. Stuff like this should be kept underground, literally...I mean, buried in a cemetery and eaten by maggots; the same maggots who listen to Limp Bizkit and Korn."
5,On this page you see a little girl giggling ata hippopotamus,"This band is going to be big. Originality is bleeding out of the cd. science is awesome, but it hardly even covers the atomosphere of their live shows. rage, chili peppers, korn, mr. bungle, combined with with a twist. and made 1000X better. For anyone who likes that crazy thing called music, this should be your #1 pic. what are you waiting for. buy it."
5,This cd rocks! It mixes many differant styles into there own,"I recomend everyone at this page buy this cd. Don't even think twice about it. The cd has awesome guitar work like Korn, awesome jazz sounds, funk, and a tiny bit of electronica which just mixes it into a great cd! DJ Lyfe is also awesome on this cd...I recomend buying incubuses first album which is an ep with a great price from amazon.com...it is called enjoy incubus.."
5,Best thing I've heard in a while,"Like a cross between Faith No More, and Mr. Bungle...with a vocalist almost the equal of the great Patton. This music has all the elements that I love about music, originality, courage to know you won't be top 40 and actually fresh...with Faith No More gone, Incubus eases the pain quite a bit"
5,awsome is an understatement_,"If you like heavy metal rap you will like this album. Incubus is the best band that has it togeather and they like to do there own thing. Other albums I would recomend for you are Make Yourself, Morning View, and any hoobastank."
5,INCUBUS AT ITS BEST,"Science is truly an icredible album, it gets you hooked from the beggining to the end. Their album's unique style of funk and metal, deserves the title SCIENCE, almost like an experiment. With Brandons fast rapping (or whatever you want to call it), and the electronic touches from DJ Lyfe, truly makes this album stand out.A must have album for every Incubus fan.For those who are expecting this album to be more like Morning View and Make Yourself, it is totally different, much more heavier and funky. And for those who are looking for something more refreshing, just get this album. Fav Tracks: New Skin, Certain Shade of Green, Deep Inside, Anti Gravity, and Vitamin"
5,Worthy of anyone's collection,"Incubus is a great band. At first I found their sound somewhat bland, but SCIENCE really grows on you. The album has a bit of rap, funk, metal thrown together and shaken a bit. The lead singer is very versatile and has good range. He does suffer from I-wanna-be-Mike-Patton syndrome (but that's ok, I have that too). Most Faith No More fans will find this a good listen, and some may upgrade it to a regular listen schedule like I have. Athough they do lack some variety, I'd rank them as one of the better new bands around.. they make Korn, Rage Against the Machine, and Limp whatever-the-hell-they-call themselves look like punks. Fav song off this disc: AntiGravity Love Song"
5,Amazing,"At first I hated this sort of music, but Incubus has changed my ideas completely. The music is like nothing i've heard before and find it hard to think of a band they sound like. This is totally amazing and gets better every time I listen to it."
5,The Heavy Beats,"This was the first Incubus album I got. I loved every song espessaly Redefine (the best song on the album), New Skin, Idiot Box, and A Certain Shade of Green. I also got Make Yourself afterwards, but it sort of dissapointed me."
5,couldn't be better,"i got this cd about a week ago after it had been suggested tome by a friend. i didn't think it'd be that good, i hadn't even heard incubus before. i thought they were some heavy speed-metal band or something. i was wrong. this cd is one of the most diverse ever. the guitar work by Mike Einzinger ranks among the likes of Tom Morello, and he sounds a little like Tim Mahoney of 311. the scratches by DJ Lyfe are phat. he uses all these funky interludes and stuff that really give flavor to the cd. the drums and bass are fresh and funky as hell, especially the slap stuff. the lyrical content on the cd is good too. it's not as angry as Rage but not as aboutnothing as 311. Brandon Boyd is an awesome singer, no doubt. the 11 minutes of hidden track are cool, especially the ""all fancy all crazy part"". ok so basically this album is the shiznit so go and get it."
5,SOOOO GOOD!!,This CD has it all. From the loud guitar slashing of Mike Einziger's guitar to Lance's phenomenal bass playing to Brandon's melodious voice and Joses incredible drumming ability and D.J. Kilmores scratching adds a different and new life to the record. S.C.I.E.N.C.E. is an unexplainable accomplishment that shows many different styles of music that can only be described as Incubus. BUY THIS NOW!!!
3,Mix Everything Together and you get Incubus,"That's right mix an Alternative voice, some Metallic grooves, Techno, and as I just found out some Jazziness. I haven't heard mush but from what I heard it is an alright Alternative Techno-Metal!! I believe that these guys actually go back into the late eighties as I noticed they were aclaimed on a t-shirt worn by a member of Obituary !They might be really coming into the light because they are on tour with Pantera and Black Sabbath !!"
1,there was music on this CD?,"I saw them open for Black Sabbath at the Horizon, and I must say, that they really blow. So who died and gave these guys instruments?"
5,SIMPLY AMAZING,"INCUBUS WITHOUT A SHADOW OF A DOUBT, IS THE BEST ROCK BAND OUT THRE RIGHT NOW. THEY ARE SO UNIQUE AND BRANDON BOYD IS THE MOST AMAZING SINGER I HAVE EVER HEARD. EVERY BAND MEMBER IS AMAZING. THERE CD S.C.I.E.N.C.E PROVES THAT THEY HAVE THEIR OWN UNIQUE STYLE AND ALSO PROVES THE BAND MATURED FROM THEIR LAST 2 ALBUMS. ANY ROCK FAN THIS IS A MUST HAVE!!"
5,Totally Awesome!,"I've had this cd for a while and I think it is the best cd I own! I don't care what others say about it, it rocks! With songs like ""New Skin"", ""Glass"", ""Calgone"", and ""A Certain Shade of Green."" it is the best cd ever. The ECD is quite weird but interesting, because you can access their secret website. I espesilly like ""Calgone"" because of the ending and the long set of hidden tracks, 11 to be exact! It is also great to skateboard to! If you like Static-X, Limp Bizkit, and KoRn, this cd is for you!"
5,Nice,"I love this CD. Their only CD that you can label as ""Metal"". Each song is strong and inspiring. Maybe I'll never get tired of this CD. Its lyrics aren't distructive or anything."
5,The best CD from Incubus,"This CD is the CD that got most of the die hard Incubus fans addicted to their unique sound. From thrash metal songs such as ""A Certain Shade of Green"" and ""Calgone"" to the spacey jazz feel of ""Summer Romance"" (Summer Romance proves that the band can not only play hard, but can play soft as well) Icubus maintains a sound that is unique only to them, and allows you to identify their songs immediately. Although the feel isn't the same from song to song this is how Incubus grabs a hold of your attention and won't let go. Whether you are a hard rock fan, or a fan of heavy metal this CD is sure to please your taste for this genre of music, and if you're new to Incubus or heavy metal this CD is a definate buy for you."
4,Great,"This CD is simply great. Mainstream songs in an album before anyone knew about them! Full of great funny vocals, rock, unique tracks, like Magic Medicine which is a fantastic track for those of you that like turntablists! Some other great songs on the CD are Favorite Things, Calgone, and New Skin (which a live version appeared on Family Values 98). Another song to note is A Certain Shade of Green which is a very sarcastically funny song of how slow things move in the singer's world. Even the hidden track after Calgone is hysterically funny, original and must be heard!"
5,"This cd deserves the success ""Significant Other"" has had","I have had this cd for over two years, and I still enjoy it every time I listen to it. Incubus has way more of a funk vibe than a rapcore vibe to their sound, and they have a DJ that doesn't just sit in the background and scratch records without a clue of what to do. The music is definetly heavy, but Brandon Boyd's voice is amazing, even during the most rocking parts he stays singing in his melodic voice and it sounds awesome. He also adds some interesting instruments into the mix, using percussion and digideroos to add to an already interesting mix. If you like this, you should check out Faith No More(who had a big influence on the band), Snot, System of a Down, and Ultraspank."
5,100% Pure Adrenaline,"I happened upon Incubus by chance while I was making a cassette to run to. I thoroughly enjoyed every bit of S.C.I.E.N.C.E. so much that I bought their other album, Enjoy Incubus. What an awesome find! It's like a running on pure epinephrine. If you like Blink 182, Sevendust, KoRn, & Third Eye Blind, add Incubus and you're complete! (until their next album) Enjoy!"
5,There is no possible way to be disappointed.,"The first song I heard on the radio by Incubus was New Skin. I hadn't heard anything by them for the next few months. Then I was talking with a friend and he told me to get the CD. I voiced my concern because you never really hear anyone talking about them. Anyway, I got the CD and a few songs were pretty cool at first.After listening to this CD many times (I've listened to it more than any other CD I have), I've come to like EVERY song on the CD VERY much. It's not that some just 'sound cool' or are 'ok.' Every song on the album is a GREAT song. I really don't see a way anyone could be disappointed after listening to this album."
5,Simply Amazing Sounds,"This Cd is absolutely incredible, as are Make Yourself and Morning View. Each Incubus CD offers almost a totally different style than their other CDs, but they are all really good. Outstanding tracks include Idiot Box, A Certain Shade of Green, Favorite Things, and Summer Romance. I just love Incubus because they are so different from just about anything else I have heard. Just a tip, if you can, also try to find a live track of an acoustic version of A Certain Shade of Green, and compare it to the original. You will be pleasantly surprised by the acoustic version."
3,Boring voice,"Haven't listened to all of this audio CD yet, but there's some good principles. However, there is a couple of negatives I could say about it: 1) Very boring voice; 2) Huge amount of repetition, both within the book itself, and within some of the other titles by the same author (22 immutable laws of marketing, 22 immutable laws of branding, Positioning etc.) - once you've read or heard one of these, you've heard Jack Trout's principles on marketing, broadly speaking. ; 3) Not saying the principles are all flawed by any means, but some are a little dated and probably need to be brought into the 21st century bearing in mind the electronic age we live in. By the way, on the subject of the book The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing, there is an interesting website where Augustine Fou pulls it to pieces - not saying I agree with it all, but makes interesting reading alongside the book. Just Google Augustine Fou and find his review - called The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing No Longer Apply."
2,Why dumb down a potentially cool binary watch?,"I was excited when I discovered these watches, until I noticed the base ten digits printed on the face to help wannabes read binary. What's the point of wearing a binary watch if you can't read binary? And One deosn't have a single model without the idiot numbers on the face. Seriously, One, if you want to market a cool watch to programmers and ditigal electronic engineers, you MUST remove the idiot numbers. At least give us one model without the binary trainign wheels."
5,very revealing nutritional book that will alter the way you choose to eat,"I am nearly finished with this slow but insightful read. The research that has gone into this book and what it reveals is startling as well as disturbing. It makes you realize how the massive food industry lobbyists ""the government included"" could care less about America's health. It makes me fearful for our future and our children. If you care about why so many people have cancer, simply read this book and then react!!!!!"
5,Health Awareness,"If you are seeking the truth about the American diet, read this book. It will change you eating habits forever and therefore change your life. There are horrible products in our food system that have been allowed by the FDA, for instance, that are making people sick or aiding in peoples' sicknesses. It is vital that we learn how to avoid the foods that contain these contaminants to optimize our health and how we function every day. Don't be controlled by medications handed out by doctors. These are not solutions to our problems and in fact they cause more ailments and only delay consequences of our eating habits. Learn for yourself about our SAD (standard Amercan diet) and gain the education you need to change your eating habits. You won't regret reading this book."
4,The China Study,Every physician who desires to know how to lead patients to wellness and to reduce the incidence of major diseases should read this book. Some thick skin will be needed for the chapter on modern medicine. Dr. Campbell and son write a compelling story of powerful scientific evidence that leads to conclusions about how simple dietary changes can extend healty life span. The book should motivate scientists to insist on openness in nutritional science and to maintain skepticism of nutritional recommendations that come from professional or government committees dominated by individuals with ties to big agricultural and pharmaceutical industry.
5,Health Information...par excellance!,"The China Study covered over 650,000 Chinese over a ten-year period. The United States contributed almost three million; while the Chinese contributed almost six million. If it had been done in the USA...it would have cost us ten times as much.It was the largest study of diet and its repercussions ever done. With all the conflict of interest in America...it probably never will be done here.This book is one of the most important health books that I have read in 47 years of research. Many of the people I love received it for a holiday gift this year..."
4,Cholesterol Correction TriFecta,"I like the fact that the author calls out people that he believes are a hindrance to getting Americans on track from a health perspective -- and he McDonald's isn't the key culprit. Doctors, big Pharm, and the government all have their hands in the epidemic.He does go off the deep end on a few ideas. Most academics do though. The desire to have government intervention is never the answer and at times the author suggests that it is.The title is a bit misleading because the entire book is not about the China Study. Plenty of references to peer reviewed articles give the effort credibility."
4,Good Bye Animal Proteins,"Book was recommended by my doctor. It's very well written and convincing. Its advice to eliminate animal protein in order to improve one's health is well documented with impressive stats.Although the book was convincing, this life long canivore will not be able to become a purist vegan. Nevertheless, now aware of the harm from animal proteins, I will cut down eating foods containing them."
5,A MUST read,"Everyone who cares about their health should read this book. All doctors, nurses, researchers, and everyone else in medicine needs to read this book. I bought multiple copies and plan to give them out as presents for Xmas. Reading this book will open your eyes to how easy it is to prevent and cure diseases that we are so accustomed to being a death sentence. We don't have to give up!"
5,Everybody Should Read This Book,"This book is a real eye opener. The facts are there. If Americans don't change their diet, they're going to die. Just take a look around. Do you see overweight Asians? If you say YES, its because they have adopted an American diet. Older Asians are slim because they eat a plant based diet. This book opened my eyes. And I started eating differently and within a short period of time, I saw differences. This book is full of facts, just the facts. The conclusions are yours to make."
5,The Most Important Book I Have Read,"This book is beautifully written and researched. It is clear that for the health of this country we should help virtually all citizens become whole grain, plant-based eaters. I did and am losing weight and feel great. For those with heart disease, read 'Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease' by Esselstyn - fantastic!!!!!"
5,MUST READ,"Simply put, this book is a must read for everyone. It should be a requirement in High School, quite frankly. As Dr. Phil says -- ""No matter how flat a pancake is, it has two sides."" While I recognize that while reading this book, it really does include some amazing and astonishing information that is beneficial to all."
3,"That it is, comprehensive.","Although I found it to be interesting, I still have my doubts about how the statistics were used. It is rather boring reading at times."
4,Important information for general education,"Dr Campbell has a general disregard for the medical profession which is somewhat pervasive in his story. There are several scientific elements missing from the studies, however, he presents in a pretty clear manner a huge scandal in America - Go figure, it's all about money after all! The study in China is a refreshing look into the reality of living the easy life and the diseases and cancers we bring on ourselves as a result. Fascinating reading!"
5,A Very Good Read,"Words cannot describe how good this book is. On a scale of 1 to 10 this book is aeasy 10. Read it, I guarantee you will find it worth while.Post-Script - It is now late June 2011, I have lost 45 pounds, I feel great, I have re-read the book three times. Each time I get more out of it. This is by far the most important book I have ever read. If you care about your health, your weight, the health and welfare of your kids, read this book. True you can Google the title of the book and find some Naysayers, such is life.Read the book and form your own opinion"
5,Misleading Title,"The title is somewhat misleading, as the book is about much more than the actual China Study, which makes up only one of five parts in the book. This book gives solid evidence to the many benefits of a plant based diet. I have lost over 30 lbs. since going on this type of diet and gone from a 40"" waist to 36"". The book also tells how we Americans have been brainwashed by the meat and dairy industries, with the help of our own government! The author should do a sequel with more details on their findings in the study."
4,Good read for health concious,"The China Study offers insight into the science of studying nutrition benefits both positive and negative. It also contains some eye opening information about our health care industry. One will find it hard to read this book and not want to make changes in their lifestyle, also you will look at information dispensed by the people responsible for guarding our health with a more critical eye. The book is a compilation of numerous scientific studies, is written for people who tend to think logically and contains over 700 references to related studies."
5,Please read this book!,"I am a registered dietitian and this is the most profound, important book on health and the food we eat that I have ever read. It is based on the largest study of nutrition ever conducted, but includes much more nutrition research findings than even what the China Study revealed. T. Colin Campbell (no relation to me) is one of the most knowledgeable, respected nutrition researchers of our time and very engagingly shares a wake-up call for us all. I could not put this book down. If you are interested in food or good nutrition, please read this book. If you are interested in good health, have a serious health problem or want to avoid one, please read this book. If you prepare meals for people you love, please read this book. If you eat, please read this book. It could change your life -- it certainly did change mine."
2,Didn't care for format or overall tone,"This book encouraged me to revert to fundamental learnings on what to eat and how to live. I believe we must first seek out and recognize what our Creator has designed for us to sustain life, then look to information that has been available to us for centuries. Read the words of God, Hippocrates, Airola or Gerson for reliable facts and guidance in the field of nutrition and health. I will add though... I think atleast one of the authors was in the documentary ""Forks Over Knives"" which was worth watching. I enjoyed seeing people overcome afflictions:)"
1,"Through no fault of the sender, the item never arrived","After waiting for a couple of weeks for my item to arrive, I checked the package tracking. The seller had taken the item to USPS immediately following my purchase of the item, and USPS stated that it was delivered to my address two days later. After checking with my apt leasing office, the local PO, and everyone in between, I was basically informed by USPS that I have no recourse to recover my money, as according to them, the package was delivered. The seller was as helpful as could be under the circumstances, and assisted me with obtaining tracking info, as well as making suggestions for contacting local POs, etc. However, I will NEVER purchase a product that is being shipped USPS again and recommend that others don't either. The USPS was unhelpful, slow, and pretty rude. I have never had these issues with UPS or FedEx, and I order online fairly regularly (although this experience makes me hesitate to continue doing so.)"
1,Rating the Discussions...Not the Book,"I didn't read all the discussions, but the ones I did read were so far from credible intellectual discourse, I wouldn't consider any of them helpful. It was more like a political debate, and trying to segregate the ""facts"" from the ""fracts"" was so tiring I gave up in disgust.I'll stick to the Reviews in the future!"
1,Another left wing nut who knows nothing about science,"Go Paleo. Veganism will kill you early. Steve Jobs dead body will back me up on that.A high carbo and low fat diet is the cause of many diseases. It raises insulin levels in the blood. Insulin is a hormone. You have too much of any hormone and problems arise, such as obesity, diabetes, skin ailments, lung problems, cancer, mental disease, etc. Get off the plants. Your not a herbivore. Your a hunter/gatherer. A caveman."
1,Pseudo-science rubbish,"There are a lot of claims in this book and virtually no evidence of said same. After I hit upon several claims that just didn't sound right I did a bit of journal research. Turns out that this ""study"" has been hauled over the coals for the rubbish it is. No wonder it is a book rather than a peer reviewed journal paper."
1,More vegan myth,"Just more vegan propaganda wrapped up to look like a legitimate study. Have you noticed how many of the usual culprits that are highly recommending this book have an vegetarian agenda? i.e. McDougall, Barnard, Ornish et al. What this book *can* teach you is that statistics can be presented in such a way as to prove most anything you want."
3,Many assumptions made,"Doctor Campbell, a world renowned PHD and now a vegetarian as a result of his studies of cancer, has made certain assumptions that don't delve into what ELSE was removed from the diets of the subjects, such as sugar and other fructose-containing foods. I'm not a vegetarian and never will be, but the overall message of the very well-written book, I believe, is misleading.Man was never and is not intended to be vegetarian. We're omnivores and a diet of both meat, fish and vegetables, without the processed foods, sugars and grains will maintain our health by reducing the cellular inflammation and keeping our immune systems ready to fight the real bad guys, not the junk we're putting inside ourselves as food.This book is well worth reading, just don't ""take it to the bank""."
5,The China Study,it's a very interesting book and everyone should read it. We'd already read it and bought copies to give to other people.
5,A Must read book!,"Dr. Campbell did an excellent work to show us his extensive research results in this book Because of this book and Dr. Neal Barnard's Food for life, I changed my diet to be a vegan with no added or low added fat. Now I feel better than ever at the age of 50. I am very grateful for Dr. Campbell and Dr. Barnard for changing my life for better! I lost 4 LBs of weight without trying. I used to have a constipation for the last 35 years, but it is gone. I wish I had read this book sooner. I highly strongly recommend this book!!"
2,Book,"It wasn't what I expected. I was a little disappointed, but life goes on. Thank you for the item and it wasn't ur fault."
4,Bought for a friend,"He said it is very helpful. I have nor personally read the book, yet! A lot of helpful information. Will read soon."
3,Great For People That Need A Ton Of Research,"Ok, I admit it. I have Attention Deficit Disorder and this book was entirely to much for me to get through. All I need is someone to say ""If your problem is *this* then you should be cutting *this* out of your diet and adding *this* to it, and this is why."" I realize that most people want to research the heck out of everything they are doing or what they are going to do but I'm not one of them. If you are like me and just want to be given the basics then avoid this book at all costs. If you are the type of person that needs to know every little detail of the science behind all of the foods you are recommended to eat, this is the book for you."
5,Everyone should read this!,"Every chapter is blowing my mind. Wow, I'm a vegan now and so is my family after reading this!"
4,China study,I got the book cause it was recommended to aid me in some of Illness and for learning to be Vegan eater. So far I have just read over some of the pages to make sure I am eating Healthy . Which is a great help.
5,A must-read for anyone who wants to look after their health,This book provided great insights into some of the most common health issues our society are having today especially in developed worlds. The author is spot on in pointing out that we should focus more on changing our diets as a preventarive measure which will significantlyreduce our health care costs.
5,If you care about what you eat,Have only read a few chapters but I'm hooked. Well written scientific research that can be understood by anyone. It will shift my eating habits for sure
5,changed my diet and my life,- plenty of scientific data to back claims- full and complete citations- the main idea is hard to ignore- now I know how to take care of my diet- can be a bit lengthy
5,Life changing book,"So much great information, presented in a logical and credible (not to mention well researched) way. Definitely a life changer. If you don't go completely vegan you'll at least cut way back on the animal products."
3,interesting read,I found this book a very interesting read that has changed my diet. the studies are very informative. It can only make you more healthy.
5,great book,I have been looking for a while a good explanation about nutrition and this book really has filled that need. This book should be mandatory reading for all.
5,Fabulous book,"This is a fabulous book on nutrition that totally blew me away! The information in this book is really important to anyone who wishes to avoid heart disease, diabetes, cancer, osteoporosis, or obesity. Some of the scientific findings are absolutely astounding. This is a must read!"
5,Excellent source of nutrition research,"For those of us who don't want to rely on drugs or surgery to correct health problems, this book has comprehensive information based on long-term thorough studies that will help make personal lifestyle changes to control your health and well-being.Diane Kavanagh, C.W.C."
5,I love reading about nutrition. and This book is the next step to my recovery from bad eating habits.,This is a very interesting book and it is easy to read and understand. I am very interested in my own health. and I would like to see my children and grandchildren benefit from my studying this book. I recomend it for any one who wants to be healthly.
5,An absolute must read for anyone who consumes food.,"A very good book, and a very clear message: You are what you eat.This book is simply a must read for anyone who consumes food, period.Read it or keep believing what the powerful food lobbies and pharmaceutical industries wants us to believe: That all is find and dandy with the way you eat and live as long as you pop a couple of pills and undergo surgery every once in a while, while suffering a downward spiral of life quality and lifespan.Reading some of the comments here on Amazon of the people who gave only 1 star I can only come to the rational conclusion that they are deep deep in the pocked of the food and pharma lobbies. Just like the scientist and politics that once refuted the dangers of smoking."
1,Waste of Money,"If you have not bought this do not bother. The book says asian diet is better but there health statistics are not very good. So read fit for life, its better."
1,Ridiculous pseudo-science,"As far as I can tell, the book is one giant deception designed to prove a false thesis (that animal products are unhealthy) by manipulating statistics. To the untrained eye, which includes the vast majority of readers, it seems like a brilliant work of scientific heroism. In reality, it's a bunch of garbage put together by an incompetent and severely biased ""scientist"". Please read Denise Minger's responses online before you make any foolish decisions based on this shameful piece of quackery."
2,sadly not the answer,This book came highly recommended so I bought it. I was very disappointed in it. It is just a study and you can make a study say or show anything.Very wordy. Not the answer to America's health crisis.I am not saying that the real answer is simple or that it is even out there but it isn't this.
1,China Study debunked,"The China study was an observational study. Correlations deduced from an observational study do not - in fact, cannot -- prove causation. As Dr. Eade points out, all you can really do with data from an observational study is to form a hypothesis, which must then be tested in randomized, controlled trials, to ferret out the truth about whether or not x actually causes y.In many cases, the data (presented in arduous detail in the book Diet, Life-Style and Mortality in China) do not show statistically significant correlations between animal protein consumption and disease such as cancer at all. ****On the contrary. It would seem that sugar and carbohydrates are correlated with cancer - not animal protein**** In addition, the data indicate that fat is negatively correlated with cancer mortality, which again contradicts the claim that meat is harmful."
1,Not recommended,"Many claims made in this book are in defiance of medical history and common sense.Degenerative diseases emerged explosively in the 20th century (following the invention of the high speed steel roller mill, which made white flour and white sugar very cheap). Yet people have been consuming animal products since long before the 20th century. The explosive growth of cancer, diabetes, and heart disease does not correspond to an explosion in the consumption of animal foods.The book doesn't mention America's premiere thinker on nutrition and health, Weston Price. It doesn't explain why the French, Swiss, and Eskimos are healthier than Americans, despite their diets rich in saturated animal fats.This book was extremely disappointing, and I would not recommend it to anyone."
2,Title of Book Is Deceiving!,"Most of the people reviewing this book give it stars based on whether or not they agree with what the book says or not. I have to say that my review has little to do with my agreeing or not agreeing with the content.I am giving it only three stars because it is called the China Study, so I expected the book to be primarily about just that, the China Study. However, not even 1/4 of the book was about the China Study. It doesn't go very in depth about the study. If you've seen Forks Over Knives, then you know about 90% of the content of the China Study portion of the book. It's very deceiving to name the book after a study and then not actually have the book go that in depth into the study. So whether you agree with the book or not, don't expect to learn extensively about the China Study."
5,Fantastic,He uses the phrase whole foods plant based diet about 5 million times but he has enough evidence to justify it. Highly recommended reading for everyone.
5,Can Capitalism really cause so much evil?,"This book explains scientifically a MAJOR cause of cancer, diabetes, and heart disease that if action were taken to implement the findings, the dairy and beef industries and all those business sectors that depend on the dairy and beef industries (like pizza) would be financially destroyed. Also, the industries that profit from treating cancer, diabetes, and heart disease would be decimated as a result of the near elimination of these diseases from society. Likely, that is why the American Cancer Society, which provided some of the funding of this 20 year study, has remained so quiet about the findings as has the ""leaders"" in Washington who funnel BILLIONS of dollars to fund ""the fight against cancer, heart disease, dibetes, etc."" Christians, by their very credo, are SUPPOSED to love their neighbors as themselves. This book indicates American Capitalists love their neighbor's money above all else."
5,The China Study.,I found the book to be quite enlightening. I appreciated the scientific approach to studying the effects of our diet on our health. I feel that I was given the knowledge to better assess my diet.
5,Great informative read.,This book is awesome. Everyone should read it. I will stay away from doctors as much as I can. I feel so empowered now. Praise God for courageous men like Dr.Colin.
5,Stick with the basics.,Some people need a lot of convincing to do what they know is better for themselves. Does anyone think eating hot dogs or cheesteaks on a weekly or daily basis is good for them? Of course not. Don't be one of those people who wait until 'all the evidence' is in. All the evidence will never be in. This study is well done and the what it suggest is something most people already knew.
5,Fantastic Read,I love the information this book gives. It is frightening to know our gov purposely allows us to be poisoned and gives us false information that concerns our health. This is a must read for every American adult.
3,Outlying data points,"I read most of this book over the past weekend and while I found many of Campbell's points to be persuasive, I was puzzled by some data anomalies that he did not explain. For example, in several charts documenting consumption of animal protein and dairy, the French were rather high on consumption of those foods but did not, according to Campbell's data, suffer as much from the ""diseases of affluence"" Campbell is addressing. Also, while the Japanese state of health was praised at several points, Campbell never addresses high levels of fish consumption in the Japanese diet. Based only on the data he presented (I am not a nutritional scientist), the case does not seem to be so cut and dried as he presents it. That bothered me."
3,Type 1 diabetes remark is hogwash!,"I breastfed my daughter (who has type 1 diabetes) from birth to age 2 (yes, TWO) and she was VEGAN, eating ONLY ORGANIC food until she was about 10, so the author's unfounded and unproved and just plain WRONG idea that cow's milk causes type-1 diabetes makes the entire book worthless to me. Sure, we all know by now that diet is important to health, but people who assume they know it all is a sure sign that I want nothing to do with it."
5,Changed my life,"I never knew why vegetarianism was good for you, or if meat and dairy was actually bad at all (and as an avid cheese-lover I wasn't sure I wanted to learn). Now I know. A must read for anyone concerned with weight or long-term health."
5,Everyone should read this book!!!,"A friend of mine recommended this book to me and it changed not only the way I eat but also my life. I decided to avoid animal foods and switch to a plant based diet mostly for health reasons. My total cholesterol level was close to 300 and it was time to do something drastic. What did I have to lose? After just four weeks on the diet, I decidied to have my cholesterol checked. I wasn't very far into the diet change at that time but I wanted to see if my hard work had paid off any. My cholesterol level had dropped from 283 down to 220. My goal is to get it below 150.I still have a way to go but if I can do it, anyone can!"
5,China Study,"Possibly one of the most important books that everyone should read. I was already a vegan, but the science and statistics were astounding."
4,Convincing study,"This is a convincing book on the topic of how animal based products can compromise your health. However, to implement it I strongly suggest Eat to Live by Joel Fuhrman. That book will tell you how to eat a healthy plant based diet and avoid the health problems that both books describe in detail."
5,Nutrition education nobody showed us before so clearly!,"Well written without being pedantic while showing facts, not favoritism, in presenting undeniably important information on heart disease, cancer, diabetes and yes, long-term health with regard to what we eat. Explains how big business plays a biased part in disseminating the same data.The China Study: The Most Comprehensive Study of Nutrition Ever Conducted and the Startling Implications for Diet, Weight Loss and Long-term Health"
4,The China Study,"The China Study is one of the best books ever written and has to be on the bookshelf in every home. It is the true against spoiled orthodox medicine science in roped party with pharmaceutical industry.Alois KolarPractitioner of Natural Health - Natural Hygiene, BH.Sc."
5,Most Important Book!,"This is the most important and impactful book I have ever read. The science of it all is incredible and totally makes sense. And it is written so superbly that it reads like a fascinating detective novel! I was a confused Atkins/South Beach meat eater, but after this book I am a committed vegan. I will no longer put short term weight goals ahead of eating properly. I am down right scared. It may be too late for me, but I feel that giving my daughter the gift of veganism and good health will be one of the best things that I can teach her. Dr. Campbell has passed on a lifetime of good science and ethics, and is not afraid to take on - everyone!! - other scientists, US medicine, media, industry, etc. There is so much confusing information out there, but once you read this book, and all the science behind it, I believe you too will be convinced of the relationship between what you eat and preventable diseases."
5,Just the Facts on Diet and Health,This is a very comprehensive and yet easy to read book on the relationship between diet and health. Presents the arguements and counter-arguements but will not be readily accepted by the big industry lobby groups. It thoroughly cuts through attempts by industry to confuse people into complacency.
4,Not really about the China Study....,"It was a good book, very readable and engaging. However, it dealt only briefly with the China Study he helped to conduct. When he talked about his findings, he did it in a very generalised way, more to sell a ""point"" (eat a whole food, vegan diet) rather than to convey the nuances of his findings. This was disappointing.However, there was some interesting (and scary) discussions about how excess protein in the blood can trigger cancer growth, and the havoc that cow's milk can wreak on children.I'm giving the whole foods vegan diet the one month trial (as he suggests), just to see how I feel on it. He's given plenty of evidence here (through other studies, not just his own) that it can reverse diabetes, heart disease and cure obesity, and for those reasons alone, it's worth experimenting with."
2,Read the following breakdown:,"Here: Rawfoodsos dot com.The one of the best critiques of this book out there. Everyone, defenders and otherwise, should read the above post. Very interesting points, and it makes me wonder if agenda came before science and logic in this book. Props to Free The Animal."
1,Cooked Statistics for a Vegan Cause,"This is a sad case of a prominent vegan author who ""cooked"" statistics to serve his cause. You absolutely must read the reviews that have been buried way below, notably the ones by Kaayla T. Daniel, author of THE WHOLE SOY STORY with the title ""Lies, Damn Lies and Statistics"" and by ""Chris"" entitled ""Sacrificing science for ideology."" They are right on and I couldn't possibly say it better."
1,A Study In Bias,"Before anyone takes this book seriously, I suggest reading the 1-star comments here. This book is full of misleading information, not to mention contradictions and biased fallacies.It might interest those with critical minds who think for themselves to note that the author of this book is on the scientific advisory board of Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM). The PeTA Foundation houses two charities . . . PeTA and PCRM. I suggest knowing what the American Medical Association said about PCRM might come as a surprise to some folks who leap before they look. It's impossible to dismiss the misinformation in this book as not being part of an agenda, no matter the credentials of the author.And by the way, the connections between PeTA, PCRM, and ALF, ELF, and SHAC are undeniable. Read their FBI files. You might also find the comments to this particular review interesting."
1,A Biased Viewpoint Leads to a Biased Result,"This book proves the point that science is often heavily biased towards a particular viewpoint. The author wishes to prove the value of a vegetarian diet and does so using mere associations that are not scientific. There is little true science in this book, and I was very disenchanted with it. The physiology of a human being is omnivore, not an herbivore as the author will have us believe. The book's conclusions don't make sense when the physiology of a human is referenced. Reviewers should be ashamed of themselves giving this biased book positive recommendations."
1,Horrible Book; This study has been refuted many times.,This is a terrible book. The China study has been refuted and found to contain false information. I would not waste your time with his lies!
4,"Not as solid a case as I'd hoped for,but a great start...","This book is full of problems. For the best rebuttal to the argument that I've found go to letthemeatmeat.com, the official rebuttal source of Dr. Campbell. Dr. Campbell is likely on to something but makes a weak case for it. He extrapolates too much and conveniently ignores some established benefits to animal products. Another good rebuttal site would be Rawfoodsos.com, and associated links for rebuttals.That said, the book is well worth reading."
5,The China Study - A Must Read Book,"Campbell gives us his conclusions after doing 35 years of laboratory research and 20 years of looking at human populations, their diets, and their health outcomes. He presents compelling evidence from both the lab and real life to support his view that animal protein should be kept to a minimum in our diets for optimal health. Having always been a ""meat and potatoes"" man, this work has convinced me to change my eating plan."
5,Campbell is Ahead of His Time,"A must read for anyone who wants to take responsibility for their own health. Undeniable facts put forth by a credible scientist make the case for a plant based diet. Read this book if you want to avoid the ills of a western diet.When FORD introduced safety features in cars in the 1950's no-one wanted to know about it. We all wanted to think cars were safe. Same with cigarettes. Campbell shows the same psychology is true with a plant based diet. We want to believe our diet does not need to change, but Campbell proves otherwise. You will note many deleted reviews -- big money from dairy, beef, and poultry would like to silence him.This book belongs with other nutrition classics by Dean Ornish and Roy Walford."
4,I've completely changed my diet,This book is very well written & the evidence can not be ignored. I have become a vegan because of this book & could not be happier. I have never felt better since I stopped eating animal products.
4,Interesting yet raises more questions,"I thought this was a fascinating book. Although there are so much proof and information in it, it did leave me a little confused between these findings and the rational arguments that other people teach and espouse. Is it possible that Asian people have different genetics that make these statistics more reliable for them than for Caucasians? What about the whole blood type thing? I'm not quite sure what to think or which side of the fence to be on."
4,China Study Book,It was recommended by a friend to read who had recently had a heart attack at age 39. It reveals info on the low meat diet of the Chinese people....and how this relates to the health of their lives.
5,"great book, great knowledge","for those who are searching for an ultimate health, this book will help you to understand and learn how it can be done. You must eliminate all animal products first, then beginning to eat more raw foods gradually. No one should ever die from ""heart-attack"" again!"
5,This book has opened my eyes.,"I would highly recommend this book; i believe it is extremely wel researched and just makes good sense!!!!!!!The author is a highly respected nutritional scientist not a fringe dweller with the next ""new concept"" around healthy eating.It is not overstating it to say that this book has completely changed the way i look at food and it's impact on my health and well being."
5,Life Changing,"Brillant, and easy to follow. I feel GREAT and don't miss the meat at all. I obtained a healthy body weight in a reasonable time frame. I loved my meats and cheeses and never thought this would be possible. Best book I've read in 50 years."
5,A mind opener,This book explains quite well how is our nutrition today. Translate science into common words. A must read for all human beings
4,A Must Read for those who Need Clarity,"This book was everything I was hoping it would be; very thorough, educational, comprehensive, and credible information. It is a true eye-opener for those of us who are still thinking that the FDA and such organizations are really looking out for our best interest. If you seek ultimate health for you and your family, this book needs to be on your shelf. If you have health challenges that you wonder why you can't find the source of, read this book. It is very well written, no scientific mumbo-jumbo. Tons of information that everyone who eats in America needs to know."
1,I feel I was conned,"After I saw a documentary on the subject of the massive study that was carried out in China on the correlation between diet and disease, I though this book would be a useful summary of that study. I was wrong. The China study is barely mentioned and never analyzed in an intelligent way.The book contains is the usual populist claptrap about how bad animal products are for us. Data are presented in a way that makes them look like statistics, with weak correlations and suspect conclusions. If you want to understand diet, disease and obesity, look at the primary literature.This book is full of conclusions with no serious attempt and either biological analysis or statistics. Waste of money."
4,Informative but Tough to Read at Times,"This book is beyond informative and will completely change the way you think about eating. It is amazing to learn of the adverse ways in which food changes us. It is thorough and there is a lot of knowledge to be gained however, it is written very much from the standpoint of a medical professional and can be tough to keep track at times. They do a good job of trying to offer metaphors and analogies which helps, but it is still very overwhelming in nature. If you're looking to change you lifestyle with regard to food, this is a great choice. You won't eat the same ever again. I highly recommend the cookbook ""Forks Over Knives"" as a diet companion."
5,Refreshing truth and honesty,It's nice to finally see someone standing up against big business for our health. At the end of the day we just want to make a choice based on true facts.
5,The China Study: The Most Comprehensive Study of Nutrition Ever...,"This is a stupendous, scientific book that every doctor should be aware of and apply to their practice. If they did it would change, for the better, the face of modern American medicine in both style and substance. This study proves that what we eat determines the health of our body. We are what we eat. Eat well (plant-based) and you'll be free of disease. Eat the typical/normal/usual American diet and your life will be plagued with heart disease, cancer, diabetes, etc., etc. The book is easily read by any adult looking for the science to change their eating habits for the better. I also recommend you watch the Forks Over Knives DVD and read the Forks Over Knives book and Cookbook, as well as Dr. Caldwell B Esselstyn's Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease. They all go hand-in-hand to help people change their lives for the better through food."
2,Sloppy science for those not well versed in the scientific method,"This needn't be a back and forth of opinion. Here is a transparent assessment of some of the underlying data:[...]As a trained engineer who has done research, I always trust what the raw data reveals more than the interpretation of an advocate. I know the China study is revered. But that doesn't mean it is a correct interpretation of the data."
4,What you don't know can hurt you...,"More information than most people want to acknowledge. We may be living longer, but we are not necessarily living better. Can we improve our lives by removing dairy and ""meat"" from our diets? After a friend recovered from stage 4 breast cancer by changing her diet and her spiritual and psychological mentality I had to read ""The China Study"" to find out what she knew that I didn't. The question is... do I have the determination and desire to adhere to such a reformation of eating?This is a must read for anyone who eats! Yes, anyone!"
4,Very informative. Easy to read.,"Very informative. Want to give this book to friends and loved ones. Like that all claims are scientifically backed up. Like that folks that don't have as a science background can understand. Wish the author spent a little less time tooting his own horn. Literally brags about credentials, awards, scholarships, grants over and over. We get it. Your big in the field. Don't get me wrong, I need to know the author is an expert for credibility so get that out of the way up front because I'd rather just learn about the subjectas it is truly critical and possibly life saving information."
5,The Grand Prix of epidemiological studies!!,"This is one of three must read books! It will really ""unconfuse"" you. If you are drowning in ""a sea of very bad information"", do yourself a favor and READ THIS BOOK. I have purchased dozens of copies because I keep having to give/sell my copy away to others that are searching for ways to change their lives."
5,"Excellent, Illuminating story of a Scientist's journey toward understanding","The Drs. Campbell have written an excellent book. Finally, some people who use actual research and lots of it to give advice. I also learned how much the government, industry, and most academia is so ... wrapped up together. I went to Medline and PubMed and searched out some of the studies, and so far, I've not found a single one that contradicted what Dr. Campbell has said in his book. So... eat lots of vegetables, fruits, beans, whole grains and nuts. Strictly limit dairy and meat, sugar and processed foods (or better yet, cut them out altogether). I just had my cholesterol tested, after having lost 15 pounds, and it's about 145 (down from 295 just a few years ago). And best of all? I've got more energy than I've had in years."
5,Life changing book,"This book is a life changing experience. Because of what I learned from The China Study, I've changed my diet completely. The authors write in detail the scientific studies on how nutrition and several diseases are directly related.They also write about how the powerful food and drug industry do not want this information to get out. Reads like a novel but unfortunately is true."
5,LOVE IT,"I loved this book, a wonderful amount of information, great knowledge about our diet as a nation and information about other diets as well. Thanks for the info!"
5,A must read!!,"The China Study is an eye openner for me. The comprehensive info demonstrated that the Whole-fool, plant-based diet id best for long-term health and longivity. It does not means if you get on plant-based diet, you'll definitelly never get cancer and any other illness. But this is the best, cheapest and easist way to reduce risk.Some people said, Dr. Cambpell is wrong, because if you eat a lot of high-fact, refined plant-food you'll still get obesity and other desease. But, Dr. Campbell never stated that as long the diet is plant-based, quantity and wholesome or not doesn't matter.I've switched to whole-food, plant-based food after reading this book, and I feel great. Of course, I still make sure I don't consume more calories than I need and make sure that I get plenty of exercises."
3,Barry Sears has it figured out too,"Barry Sears' books are based on these same principles and they are very accessible and written (except for one) for the lay person. If you really want to get into the science behind the nutritional advice, read his book: Enter the Zone, A Dietary Road Map to Lose Weight Permanently, Reset Your Genetic Code, Prevent Disease, Achieve Masximum Physical Performance and Enhance Mental Productivity. The easy reads are the shorter titles such as A Week in the Zone. You don't need to slog through a 400+ page book."
1,Pseudoscientific garbage,"I tried to read this book with an open mind, I really tried. I got as far as the blatant pot-kettleism between the nitrite studies and Campbell's own casein study and the diagram portraying cancer as Pac-Man with sharp teeth and then had to put it down.D. Tosh, Joseph DeMarinis, and other reviewers have done a good job picking apart the obvious errors and propaganda in this book so I won't repeat them. Suffice it to say that if you think anything in this book provides a scientific basis for vegetarianism or veganism you are sadly mistaken.If you don't eat anything containing animal products due to your moral views, great, good for you. But propagating obvious errors and outright lies because they happen to agree with your personal biases is not ""science,"" in fact it's the polar opposite of science."
1,"Wow, this is another confusing book for the public to understand","Perhaps people should keep in mind that mediterranean diets have been known to contribute to long healthy active lives. They have legumes, fruits and vegetables, high fat cheese, yoghurt, lamb and poultry as important aspects of their diet. Balance is what life is all about.This book adds to peoples confusion on nutrition and wellness.T."
4,Compelling argument,"The book is easy to read even if the basic point is repeated over and over with emphasis. His argument is so well documented that is difficult to ignore the reasoning and logic. His main claim is that an animal-based diet causes diseases...while a plant-based diet does not.However, it is hard to undo a lifetime of habits. I always felt that eating protein kept me from being hungry and kept my blood sugars even. Now I am forced to look at animal products differently and am beginning to recognize how well one can feel by limiting their role in a healthy diet."
1,Misleading data,"Bought this book after it was reviewed quite well and recommended. However, I am disappointed that the actual data of the China Study directly contradict the books message. It was actually not animal protein that was statistically significant, but WHEAT! Recommending ""whole-grain wheat"" is scientifically against what the statistics showed, gluten has shown to have very inflammatory properties in double blind studies.I recommend ""ultrametabolism"" or ""protein power"" instead"
4,Best Preventive Medical Book,I am a physician. This is the best medical textbook on preventive medicine I have ever read! It is extremely well documented andreferenced for those who want to see the evidence.
5,Great book!,This book lays out the real data from nutritional research done over the years and has no agenda and nothing to sell. No fad diet or unsubstantiated claims. Campbell references everything to actual research performed. Check it out.
5,You have to work around the anecdotes but it's a fine book,"While I enjoyed the conclusions of this book - that eating a vegetable based diet and restricting calories can reduce the incidence of some chronic disease some of the anecdotes were tedious.I would have preferred more science, less discussion about ""Big Medicine"", Government regulation and other interesting but somewhat tangential topics.I recommend this book for its useful information about diet. I'd advice glossing over the chapters about Big Business, Big Medicine and so on."
5,A must-read for everyone!,"This may be one of the most significant books ever written about nutrition, and the health of us individually and as a nation. Even as a die-hard carnivore in good health (except for a recent spike in cholesterol), it has not been as difficult as I thought to make some significant changes to a plant-based, whole foods way of eating. I would say that if there is ONE book everyone should read, this is it!"
3,the china study,"It took about 3 or 4 weeks for this to arrive as a gift.... Needless to say, very late (so says the receipitant.)"
5,Best thing you can do for your longevity,It always important to get information and make informed decisions about your health. This is one source you don't want to pass up. I've had it next to my bed for about 3-4 years now and still keep referring to it.
5,The China Study,"This book has the data driven evidence of how important a whole foods plant based diet is for health. The evidence is clearly laid out that the solution to our health crisis in America is at the ends of our forks! I would hope that every Congressperson discussing our health care ""crisis"" would read and absorb the content of this book. It would upset out society's norms to change our habits of eating, but it would save our lives and our economy."
5,My Personal Evaluation and Results,"The positive health claims and underlying reasons were of great interest. So I try the program on myself. I'm 65, a former engineer, and have noticed the aging effects, so why not. Changes noted, weight loss, increase energy, great desire to exercise and most important was the greater blood flow and functionality of my male sex organ. Being an engineer and knowledge of hydraulic fluid flow and that blood carries nutrient to and waste away, I note something had changed. Thank you T Colin Campbell."
3,Deceptive Title,"I thought that this book was one of the best researched books I've every read. However, I found his ideas repetitive and biased. This book is called ""The China Study"", however, there's very little written about this study. Most of the book details the author's professional career as well as research showing how a plant-based diet can cure or reverse common diseases. I would re-title this book, as it doesn't accurately represent the content of this book. Last, I didn't really learn anything new. I've heard all these theories before about the benefits of a plant-based diet. The author just did the work for us by providing the citations and then some of his own ideas. Overall, this book was a disappointment."
5,reviewing 'the China Study',"This book ""The China Study"" has been a tremendous influence on me. It was a shock to learn about the politics behind Department of Agriculture guidelines recommending fluid milk intake, protein source biases, and poorly thought out refined food choices. I am following the recommendations in this book and have not found them to be too hard. Also, I am getting results! This is the book to read if you want to set the groundwork for good health based on nutrition."
5,The China Study,"A great book! All persons need to read it, in my opinion.It will change your mind about what you eat, and whatthe research says you should eat to be your healthest.A lot of big money is telling us how to eat, andit is not in our best interest!Please read it!"
5,The China Study,"Unlike the vast majority of diet books, this one is written by a nutrition professor at Cornell University with decades of NIH funded research and hundreds of peer-reviewed journal articles. This book gives you the facts and lets you make up your own mind. It shows you how to minimize the diseases of our affluent society by minimizing animal-based protein and maximizing vegetable-based protein. Read the book and follow its suggestions, as I have."
5,"Lifechanging, informative, compelling.","Dr. Campbell lays out a great deal of information on diet and nutrition and their relationship with disease and health, making it clear that we should be eating unprocessed plant foods and why. He also goes to some length to shed light on why and how we've been fed so much disinformation by the dairy, meat, and drug cartells in America, and how they're keeping us fat and sick on their bad food, while profiting from the drugs that they sell us to ""make us better"". The strongest aspects of Colin's book are 1) the depth and duration of The China Study itself and 2) that he cites numerous studies to support his conclusions, and 3) his extensive credentials, exposure to the health machine and experience."
5,The best book on nutrition,"This is without a doubt the best book on nutrition I have ever read. It is backed up by hard science compiled by the most eminent researchers and academic institutions. The evidence supporting the benefits of eating a plant based diet is overwhelming. The primary author who conducted this study, Dr. Colin Campbell, PhD, of Cornell University, should be given the Nobel prize for his valuable work on the China Study. I highly recommend this book for anyone who is interested in leading a healthy and vital life."
5,The China Study,"Tremendously comprehensive. Having been a vegetarian for about 20 years, my health is excellent (I'm in my 70's and on no meds, etc) but I learned a lot. I had been told that Americans ate too much protein, expecially animal protein, and this substantialed that. I am now becoming more vegan since I know I don't need to eat eggs. However, I am sure I'll eat an occasional cookie with eggs in them, etc. I have sent info from this book to other family members and will gladly buy them a copy if they would be willing to read it. This is a book EVERYONE should read. The thing that irritated me most in the whole book is the arrogance of the doctors and scientists who say, ""Oh, people don't want to hear that,"" then withhold the information. (Some of us do want to hear the truth.) I am certain that people do not want to hear ""You have cancer,"" but that does not keep those same doctors from telling them they have the disease!"
1,What a surprise,"Have you ever had a friend invite you to lunch and after an hour and half discover they're trying to recruit you into their network marketing group? That's what I felt like after buying this book. I bought the book based on the cover info and the reviews. This book ""ain't"" what it appears to be. It's all about being a vegetarian, with all the cancer scares and medical research to back up author's point of view. God help you if you ever drink a glass of milk, make a will and get you're affairs in order. The only reason PETA isn't endorsing the book is, too many mice died in the research. Lesson learned, ""Don't Judge a Book by The Cover"""
5,Excellent book but.....,"I found this book to be very informative, thorough and easy to follow, however, I was looking for a book on how to eat healthier and was unaware till chapter 1 that this book is simply a how to become a vegetarian for life book so if that is not your goal, you may want to keep searching. I just love steak too much to give it up."
2,China Study,"As with other books on this subject, it did not address the specific issues that I was really interested in, although it has helped my brother, who suffered from aggressive prostate cancer. So, on that count, I can say that if Cancer is something that is relative to the issue, buy it. It couldn't hurt."
5,The most important book of our time.,"This book changed my life. Since reading it I've lost an amazing amount of weight and feel surprisingly healthier in just a few months. Rather than trying to sell you another snake oil weight loss diet, the book actually fundamentally changes how you think about food. The data presented is so compelling that it's undeniable, you can't help but eat differently after you've read it."
3,"Interesting studies, but conclusions are flawed","Diets don't work and neither does one that supposedly supports healthy eating primarily or exclusively through vegetarianism and veganism. My grandparents lived up to near 100 years old and they ate whatever they wanted, which this author would probably advise against. They also ate a lot of fruits and vegetables. I also know many people who live healthy happy lives who eat lots of meat and not one exclusive diet. My conclusion: Eat whatever God and nature gives you. The less processed and man made, the better. I think the Creator knows best what creation needs."
4,Great Information - You Will Be Different.,"Excellent information and fantastic bibliography (1/4 of the book!). I really do NOT want to believe the content, but find myself compelled due to the overwhelming evidence. Some really good take-aways herein.I do have to knock the author pretty heavily for the transition from ""oh you know, animal protein/fat is kind of bad"" to ""the government, big corps, and big pharma are out to get you"". I really wish he had separated these two topics up a bit, but such is life. Good book, slight propaganda aftertaste - the facts are still the facts."
5,A must read,Everything in this book makes sense. My eyes are wide open to the society we live in. I really hope there will be more people like Dr. Campbell to fight for this valuable information to be taught and practiced in our schools and medical communities. It's not difficult to understand.
5,Good book,"Very informative, well written and interesting read. My friend who is into nutrition also liked reading this book. I would recommend this."
5,Nutrition Nut,I love the book. I am still reading it but it is full of facts about the food we eat and how we can prevent some of the related illness associated with the food we eat.
4,Life changing,"This book is amazing. I borrowed a copy and found what it said to be refreshing and on the money. It changed my life. I became a Vegan (diet wise only) and bought 2 books, one to keep and another to give to some friends. They are now also becoming Vegan (diet wise)."
3,Worth a read,"The only problem i had with this book was i felt the actual data, the actual findings of the China Study took up all of 3 chapters. It may have been my fault, assuming the book was just going to be about the findings. But i sort of lost interest half way through. I felt the same topics/facts/etc.. were being repeated. I read my share of articles and health-related books and besides the actual China Study data within this book..I've read it all before, nothing new."
3,The China Study,Great book with lots of research but not for the average reader. It's more about the research and doesn't recommend how to change your lifestyle. But he does refer Dr. Esselstyne which you can buy that book to read to help with the change of your lifestyle.
3,Scientific reductionism,"The book does a good job of delivering the message that consumption of animal protein leads to various illnesses such as cancers of the breast, prostate and large bowel, diabetes, coronary heart disease, obesity, autoimmune disease, osteoporosis, degenerative brain disease and macular degeneration. I agree with the conlusion that a plant based whole foods diet is in general better than the typical animal protein diet. However, for the case of cow milk protein casein, Dr.Campbell applies the same scientific reductionism that he warns us about related to isolated vitamin and antioxidant supplements."
5,Amazingly Honest,Dr. Campbell has approached nutritional science with no preconceived ideas. He has thoroughly investigated and now understands the implications of dietary habits which he shares with the world in this easy to read book. This man deserves the highest reward!
1,Wheat is not food,"Berries and cream. Shrimp and broccoli with garlic butter sauce. Omelets with unprocessed ham, fresh feta cheese, and lots of veggies.None of the dishes I just mentioned contain any wheat, and they also contain very little carbohydrate, and no refined sugar. Wheat is not something that most humans have been adapted to eat. Tons of people are allergic to it. You may be allergic to it and not even know it.Research it.Fat does not cause heart disease.Look it up.This book is chock full of fallacies, as the preceding negative reviews suggest."
5,Dark room and Two Minute Warning,"I've been listening to Darkroom and Two Minute Warning for about 25 years and think Angel City rocks. I would like to know how to get them on CD, my LPs are getting a little scatchy. I like all the songs on each LP, but favorites are Sticky Little Bitch,Walking To Babylon Razor's Edge, No Secerts, Ivory Stairs,Take a Long Ride, Face the Day The moment Devil's Gate Poor Baby Straightjacket Wasted Sleepless Nights/ Darkroom.Is the band still together and where can I find some of their CDs."
5,Steeler Pride,We love our Steeler logo hitch. It shows our pride without being obnoxiously big; but rather in a classy subtle way. The quality is great & it has withstood some harsh winters! We'll keep this gem for the next 10 Super Bowls!
5,"incredible, great translation, but a difficult read","""The best way to read Nietzsche is slowly,"" my professor said when we began studying this book. And I could not agree more. This book contains some of Nietzsche's central ideas, including the death of God, origin of morality, perspectivism, as well as the difference between the noble and common type. I love this translation because the translator seems to focus on what Nietzsche was trying to say in German, rather than some of the other translations where they only provide a basic and rough translation.I would recommend this book if you're trying to understand the basics of Nietzsche's theories, since THE GAY SCIENCE was written during the height of his career (1882). However, do keep in mind that it will be difficult if this will be your first exposure to Nietzsche. You might also look at BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL, Hollingdale translation, since that one contains much of the same ideas, but the language is more understandable."
2,Crap for Academics,"Bought this because it was cheap and I needed the text to quote in an academic paper. No DOI. How do I cite this corectly. Advertised as a modern translation--a 100 year old translation--certainly not the best--where they changed some obsolete words for more modern ones.There are certainly better editions, but it was very inexpensive. But with a few more minutes of research you can get a better translation--or a used paper version for about the same price."
5,Classic Nietzsche,"This book is great if you already know a little bit about Nietzsche. If you don't, I would recommend Beyond Good and Evil or Twilight of the Idols (but never Thus Spoke Zarathustra!). This book is one of Nietzsche's most poetic and beautiful. If you are tired of hearing foolish people say foolish things about Nietzsche, because they have probably never read him, pick up this book. He covers a wide range of topics, and introduces some of his most important ideas (that God is dead, the eternal Return...)"
4,Mature Philsophy of Nietzsch Takes Its Shape,"Most of the concepts of Nietzsche's mature philosophy can be found in this book. Nevertheless, the book is not overly serious or dull, Nietzsche is trying to be ticklish and light-hearted, hence the title ""The Gay Science."" As with most of his other works, N. succeeds in being psychologically insightful, but also has some of the ideas that do not resonate well with modern readers. For example, he philosophizes about ""health"" and implies that his contemporaries are not healthy enough for Plato's insights and philosophical courage. At one point, he also implies that physics explains everything, and therefore, ""long live physcis!"" But he himself has never tried his hand in it, nor is it obvious that physics does in fact explain everything.In this book, Nietzsche is not yet as shrill as he would become in his last four works, written in 1888. He seeks joyful wisdom and can give plesure to his readers and insights for the curious mind."
1,The worst possible version of his greatest work,"""The Gay Science"" is Nietzsche 's most enjoyable and essential book. So it's unfortunate that the only English translation for decades was this disaster. Published under the wrong title long before anyone would have snickered at the correct one, this version is corrupt from start to finish. Look for the superior Kauffman,or Cambridge press editions."
1,"1, 2, 3..uh... 5....",ordered these after the other see-thru mounts I received lacked the right mounting screws. opened these and...missing screws. there are suppposed to be 8 long and 4 short. Included were 9? long and 0 short. there is no way for the long to work on a Winchester 94 because the threads holes in the actual rifle are very shallow. Contacted the seller to get the right screws sent and they said they would get right on it...TWO WEEKS later I received the screws-2 short and two long!? Unbelievable. So now I'm left with cutting these very small screws off somehow since I replied to the last email they sent telling them of the problem and have gotten no reply. More frustrated than I can communicate. I do however realize how hard it is to count to eight and four and for the replacement it would be hard to see the difference between 1/4 and 1/2 inch. I have concluded therefore that they are using chimpanzees to sort screws.
5,Corea's best solo piano?,"Nothing against the very fine PIANO IMPROVISATIONS VOL. 1, but VOL. 2 has a reflective quality, a simple beauty, a ""magical aura"" (when I started writing this I knew my words would come up short!) that I haven't heard elsewhere--in Corea's large catalogue or anyone else's. ""After Noon Song"" and ""Masqualero"" (a Wayne Shorter composition) are particularly wonderful."
4,Sky Cries Mary - 'Seeds' (Collective Fruit),"This five track release is said to be an EP, but in fact it turns out to be the length of a full album. First two tracks, ""Remember The Wind"" (21:43) and ""Chickaboom Cocktail"" (15:36) are a bit different than the usual Sky Cries Mary music that I've heard but I believe I liked those two off this CD the best. Also, the multi-media track for ""Chickaboom Cocktail"" was nice. Wish this band would maybe reunite and do a full scale tour again sometime. Before I was ever aware of them, they played twice in my area."
4,"eclectic, spacy, and keening","This is a wonderful little EP. My only complaint is that it is so short--I would like a full album! There are four songs; the first two especially show new directions for SCM, but all are excellent. Buy it!--at this price, you can't go wrong."
5,a instant classic and it's epic,"i have this and its tons of fun you can get weapons like staffs,nunchucks all that good stuff and it's a adventure through out the game.this is like the best double dragon ever so buy it now and it's worth your time."
4,Solid Game!,"This game is short & sweet. The game is not really difficult and also does not include a large variety of enemies. The are a number of random ""so~called"" bosses that add a little interest. The fighting techniques are the best part of this game in my opinion. There are a considerable variety of techniques to kill enemies in different degrees including the odd weapon to help throw in a little twist. The game is not very long but I still enjoy beating it out from time to time. Overall it is definitely a solid SNES game."
3,SDD:appreciate the old skool folks!,love this game and its was kind of ahead of its time for a beat em up game because you can pretty much create your own combos and make the game play look realy good. people should appreciate old school games period instead of actign like theyre too good for this now.
4,"Good book, but needs a technical editor","Dutton's is well illustrated and clearly written and it covers a lot of ground. However, it is full of technical errors. When I was writing a sailings application I worked the example problems in the sailings section of the book and was distressed to find they were full of mistakes. Later, when I took my Captain's course I spoke about this with the navigation instructor there and he claimed that he never used Dutton's examples because the problems are wide spread. So, I'd suggest reading Dutton's for the prose and then going to Bowditch if you need the math. This is all a bit sad as Dutton's is a text book and into it's 15th edition."
4,Great,This thing is the bee's knees. I have a giant cat. He consumes close a crate of fish a day as we live just behind a fish mongers. He's so big we've had to have a stable door fitted as cat flaps aren't made large enough. The problem is he can't do much as he's so huge. We try and play with him but he can't be bothered most of the time. He also does his business on the floor as he's too lazy to get up and use the Littermaid automatic litter tray.I got him this mat in the hope that he'd enjoy it if nothing else. I shouldn't have worried. As soon as this thing was out of the box he went insane. He jumped up and tore it from my grasp and then proceeded to roll on it for almost three days straight! He's actually slimming down a lot now. He very rarely has the time to go out to eat the crates of fish as he's addicted to the mat. Visitors often comment on his strange behaviour but I just tell them he's having some kind of fit and the vet is on his way.Anyway thanks for that.
5,Like a magic carpet!,"When we first opened these up, the cats suspected it was something for them. When I opened up the catnip, they definitely knew it was something for them!One of them got on one and started rolling around, making the tassels flop around exciting the other cats. When we put the other one down (I need to buy two as we have four cats) the room turned into an hysterical sight with cats rolling around and bopping the tassels!Highly recommended if you want to teach cats to get along and share. A couple of mine really don't care for each other that much, but there they were, only a few feet away from each other, rolling around and just having a blast!"
2,This was a very poor quality recording,"Whilst I love Eddie Murphy's work I found this to be one of the most frustrating CD's I have ever purchased. Not so much because of the content of the gags but more a result of the quality of the recording. The first half of the CD is great, primarily focusing on the hilarious Delirious stand Up Routine. However the latter part of the CD was barely audible. I exchanged the CD twice in the vain hope that I had a defective copy. Unfortunately it was not to be. With a superior recording I have no doubt that this would have been a worthwhile CD for any commedy lover, however I will think twice before purchasing another Eddie Murphy CD in the future if his record company deems such a recording as satisfactory."
4,"Good, but Missing some Great stuff","I bought this CD sight unseen, and for the most part, it is good. However, since I grew up listening to Murphy's first two comedy albums, I was disappointed that this CD did not feature more of his great stuff. Some of it is just mediocre. I ended up selling this CD and buying the first two comedy albums on disc so I could have ALL the great routines I remember."
3,"Starts great, ends mysteriously","The first 6 or 7 tracks of this CD are classic Eddie Murphy that all of us fans have come to know and love. BBQ, Drunk Fathers, and the Ice Cream Man are all tracks that do not disappoint. An absolutely side splitting impression of Larry Homes is also a wonderuful addition. Unfortunately, the last 5 or 6 tracks on the CD are very hard to understand, as if they were recorded from the back of a large and noisy club. I cannot make anything out on them, so I havent listened to all of them. It supprises me they realeased the tracks, because they are impossible to understand. All in all, this is a great CD, but should have been produced better."
1,Unimpressed,"The plant has not grown since I received it and planted it. It was planted a nice mixture of planting soil, compost and peat moss. It is getting a sufficient amount of both sun and water. Yet no response. Very disappointed and unimpressed! Any suggestions?"
2,lacking in extras,"I assumed this had the features listed for other Gxt series but it doesn't. The radio has 1 senitivity level for vox (as oppossed to 3), has no 100+privacy channel availability (like other gxt models), no NOAA weather channel, and no rechargable battery pack (which I didnt' expect it to). The range was about the same or slightly less that the uniden 2059ck (20 mile) set I also got (7-8 blocks where one is in the house and the other is in a car). The uniden had much better features (see my review). The brochure they send with the unit states "" all gxt series radios"" and then list the features including 3 levels of VOX, 121 privacy codes, monitor and channel scan (there is monitor feature but no scan), vibrate alert, noaa weather channel. I got the surveillance headsets and on vox they work well (although you have to turn your head to your lapel to talk into the mic and be heard). Antonline is great, I got the product in 1 week from order, shipped next day UPS."
3,A Rainbow of Education for Kids!,"Learn how the colors of the rainbow work in this video. Best for art teachers and teachers, and kids! Play Ms. Frizzle's pinball game--and rack up some colorful points! Find out what makes the colors of the rainbow and how they become colors. Find out the prism trick and how to stall you principal! (hehe!)"
3,Good version of Another Somebody Done Somebody Wrong Song,"I am pretty familiar with all of the songs on this album and having given most of them a listen I have to agree the majority of them are poor representations of the original hits. In short, they're BAD remakes! However there is at least one exception and that is B.J. Thomas' Another Somebody Done Somebody Wrong Song. I won't swear to this being the original rendition, but it is apparently the best version out there. Having searched for this great song for awhile I've found numerous albums all containing the same inferior re-recording. But the version here is different, and if this is not the original, it comes very close. As always, it's worth previewing any song before you pay for it. But in my opinion this one track passes the test."
1,Absolutely wrong track list!,Please note that the track list given in discription is absolutely different from the actual one... Had to return it.
4,NICE LITTLE LOW BUDGET FILM,"FOR A LOW BUDGET MOVIE, THIS IS ACTUALLY GOOD. THE MOVIE IS ABOUT A BOXER WHO UNINTENTIONALLY KILLS A MAN AND THEN RETIRES. OUT OF WORK, HE THEN BECOMES A BODYGUARD FOR GIRLS THAT BELONG TO A PIMP NAMED GOLDIE [ICE-T]. THEN, PROBLEMS OCCUR AS GOLDIE OWES A DRUG DEALER NAMED BLACKIE [KOOL MOE DEE] A TON OF COCAINE MONEY. THIS MOVIE REALLY SHOWS HOW NEGATIVE A PIMP REALLY IS, IT ALSO SHOWS HOW COLD THE PIMP GAME REALLY IS. ICE-T ACTUALLY DID A GOOD JOB OF SHOWING WHAT A PIMP IS REALLY LIKE. FOR A MOVIE THAT SHOWS THE PIMP GAME'S TRUE SIDE, RENT OR BUY THIS AS SOON AS YOU CAN."
3,Kinda Movie is Lazy,"The movies about a boxer who kills a man unintentionally & becomes a kinda bodyguard for Ice-T whores but he wants out. Ice wants to muscle in, into the crack game and goes to Kool Moe Dee for the base......the boxer double crosses them both and he rest.YOU'LL HAVE TO BUY THE MOVIE"
2,"Totally ""Out Kold"" Before The Fight Was Over","I couldn't take the slowness of this film. I was really diggin' the script, but the actors (that's a whole different story). The characters lacked movement and expression. There's not much anyone can say after seeing this movie. ""Good intentions - bad outcome"", I reckon."
1,Generic commercial trance,"Disappointing commercial release from an artist who is currently also responsible for classy techno-trance on his own Planet Vision label. (Check out his 'essence of a minimalistic sound' or Ultratubes' 'nektar' for cd releases)Not bad, though, if you are looking for straight forward Trance with female vocals"
4,"Recomendo, apesar de algumas limitaoes","Apesar do livro ser, por vezes, redundante e ser pouco abrangente em relao aos 4 modais de transporte (dá nfase no transporte aéreo) é um dos únicos textos que analisa o transporte na perspectiva do turimo. Sendo assim, apesar destas limitaes é um texto que serve de guia a todos os professores e pesquisadores lidando com o assunto.Although this book is, sometimes, redundant and not comprehensive to the 4 transportation modes (emphasis is in aerial transportation) it has an approach which is rare: transportation in the point of view of tourism. So, I recommend this book, although these limitations, because it serves as basic path to professors and researchers dealing with this important matter."
4,Uncloaking Marmani for Use in Balancing the Body,"An excellent text is in color, with anatomically detailed drawings, this book is very similar to the Ayurveda and Marma Therapy text by the same authors. The book is best used in hands-on workshop on marma, and is purposely cloaked of its true knowledge to prevent misuse. A basic 200-hour course in ayurveda is really necessary to understand the underlying principles, including the upadoshas, srotamsi, manas shastra (ayurvedic psychology) and ayurvedic physiology. A course in anatomy is also a prerequisite for being able to properly use the book."
1,"Minimal ""identification""","I found the title of this book totally misleading. Yes, it's compact, but it's hardly a true guide to identifying Barbies. Thank heavens it didn't cost a lot, but I'd advise you to put your money toward a more complete book."
1,NO TODO ES LO QUE TE OFRECEN,NO TIENE IDIOMA EN ESPAÑOL :( SOLO TRAE EL dvd SIN EXTRAS NI OBJETOS DE COLECIÓN.
5,Childhood Memories,Great to have this series on dvd! Watched reruns of this cartoon in the morning before elementary school. Reminds me when I was a child.
3,Speed Racer Vol. 5,"Video was of excellent quality, however I'm a little disappointed that the video was not in the original packaging. Hence the commerative license plate was not included with the shipping content.Speed Racer, Vol. 5"
3,Mind Control World Control,"I received my book on time and it is very interesting. A little old, but it was only in good/acceptable condition so it's fine and just as it should be. thanks!"
3,Some gold nuggets...but alot of pyrite,"I like Jim Keith and the research he does which few media sources are willing to tackle. There are things in this book that the reader will find fascinating. Charles Manson and Sirhan Sirhan attending drug orgies at the Polanski/Tate mansion.If true,that could be a book in its own right.My problem with this book is its lack of depth. An event or person is mentioned and before the story develops, the author has moved on to a different subject. For example, John Hinckley Jr. is mentioned and in one sentence the author alludes to a Hinckley ""double"". The subject is then just dropped. Are you kidding? It seems to me there is alot of speculation in this book and possibly over exaggerated power accredited to the CIA. Still the book offers many things for the reader to ponder."
4,Have your aluminum foil ready!!!,"Mr. Keith does an excellent job of demonstrating how the technology to simulate and/or control one's mind exists, and has been in use for years. Great chapter on supposed alien abductions."
4,Good but a few mistakes,"I found this book to be very informative. He makes one mistake in criticizing Cathy Obrienwho wrote Trance-Formation of AmericaTrance: Formation of Americaand Access Denied.Keith wrote his critique before Access Denied came out.Access Denied has all the documentation, which shows Cathy O'Brien's first book and stories are true.Unfortunately, Keith died suspiciously in 1999 so he cannot correct his mistake.[...]I recommend the book but also readPawns in the GamePawns in the Gameto get the even larger historical overview. I don't know if the most recent edition of this was edited version?"
5,An extraordinary piano recording.,"One really is at first simply stunned by the sound of the piano. These recordings are 30 years old and sound as good or better than a lot of what gets released today.And then there is the artist himself. I had never taken Cliburn for a Brahmsian. But there are so many wonderful performances on this CD. Take Op. 118 #6 for example. At first hearing, I thought Cliburn was being interpretive. Then I got out my piano edition of Brahms. And it was marked staccato just as Cliburn played it.More than just being straight with the music, is the beautiful piano tone and lyrical concentration that Van Cliburn brings to his Brahms."
2,very British,"This book contains many facts, and many, many of the author's opinions. The portion of the book which deals with WWII gives one the impression that the British received very little help from the USAAC in defeating the Axis. He expresses negative opinions repeatedly about the design, quality, tactics, etc. of the American aircraft. What was he smoking????"
4,Nice cruiser,"Got this with the 2-days shipping option and it arrived puctually on the 2nd morning. Bike looks just as I expected. I got it mainly for the cool flames. Assembly was fairly easy, but the instructions are meant for someone who have some basics on assembling a bike and I had someone to help me out.This is my first cruiser and I find it quite comfortable to ride for short journeys.I was careless when I tried to 'park' my bike on its stand and it fell over. The white paint was scratched off rather easily.Overall, I am very satisfied with this purchase and would recommend for anyone who wants a nice bike for just cruising around."
2,Walter P. Chrysler would turn in his grave,"Walter Chrysler would turn in grave if he saw what global economy did to his name: Stickered to Made in China by Bicycle Source Inc. Chrysler generic bike made from bent water pipes.It does require work to assemble and tune. Be prepared to do it or to pay for tune-up or your ride will be heavy from unadjusted bearings, misaligned breaks. I have to say though that for the money ($150), it's good deal. Bike comes with fenders, chain shield, even the bell. Not too heavy. Bar is exaggerated, could be smaller."
3,flashy STICKERS are not a PAINT JOB,"I just received the bike after eyeing it for months, and was totally let down to find that the ""flashy paint job with red and yellow flames"" in the item description is not even a paint job whatsoever. The bike is actually painted black and pearl, with flame STICKERS for the graphics. I was too cheap to spring for an Electra- they all look like they've been custom painted. I thought this bike fit the bill, and although it looks like it'll be a good ride, I'm peeling off the cheesy stickers. They remind me of the flame themed sticker sheets included with hotwheels racetracks... this is definitley not the ""Flashiest PT Cruiser paint job you've ever seen!"" (from item description)"
1,M.D. Gist 2,This is the worst movie i have seen in my entire life! It has no plot and is completely retarded. I regret ever seeing this piece of garbage. I am gonna burn this waste of technology!
3,A personal account of the dig on Bahrain,"Geoffrey Bibby was one of the first explorers of Bahrain and the first modern archaeologist to dig there. He and his partner advanced far beyond the handful of predecessors who had surveyed the island previously and discovered the remains of a Sumerian civilization there. There is still much debate over some Bibby's findings in peer journals but what can be agreed on is that the civilization of Bahrain extends back into remote antiquity.Rather than giving away more details of the book I will finish by stating that Bibby's account is a non-technical reading of his achaeological dig at the mysterious grave-mounds of Bahrain. The only thing he assumes that the reader knows is a general history of the ancient near east and he takes time to explain the finer details when they are relevant. Overall an easy read, especially if you're interested in ancient near eastern history."
5,Kick It Around - James Hunter,"Hi All! I am guessing that by now you know that it takes a very, very special CD to rate being reviewed by me. Average maybe, one in every 20 is reviewed. Well here is one that literally knocked my socks off when I played it. James Hunter a young German National has captured the essence of the 50's & early 60's Rock and Rhythm & Blues. One sensational track followed by another. Listening to James and I find no problem at all picturing him with the likes of Little Isidore & Little Leopold. The sound is THERE!! Doing a couple of oldies and a load of originally written tunes. All vocals are by James Hunter. Along with his vocal abilities, he plays one Great guitar. This will be evidenced on the one instrumental offering on the CD. I know you will feel the same as I do when you sit and listen to James Hunter. Did I say SIT?? Well you won't be sitting still!!"
5,great book,"I am 13 years old and I love carolyn meyer books such as this one which is my favorite book. This book gives you a great perspective of how anne boleyn lived and it shows you what her feelings were in every situation she was in. The book is a wonderful book for book reports which I used it for , it's great for anyone who loves historical fictions or books on anne boleyn or books by carolyn meyer."
2,Great to have for Medieval Unit study,We read this book aloud for our homeschool unit study. There are some graphic details that I can't see why they didn't leave out but is really good from historic point of view.
3,...,"This book like the others in the young royal collection was very well written but I thought it lacked some of the qualities that made it great. I (as a Henry VIII buff) loved how she protrayed Mary in Mary, Bloody Mary and I thought she was fair to her character and didnt look over her faults. I dont believe she did this in Doomed Queen Anne. Anne Boylen had her faults and if you look at history I believe it is evident that she very power hungry, and in many intaces very cruel. I believe the author glossed over that part of her character to make her appear more likeable."
3,Doomed Queen Anne,"As well with her other books about historical memories of princess' with an ""ill-favored"" fate, Carolyn Meyer does a beautiful job in handling the delicate art of capturing rustic & authentic Elizabethan feel. Accurate and compelling, you sympathize with the character and curse the fault not seen by others. ""She would see that I was no longer the ill-favored child she'd once taunted."" Anne is a young girl of a noble title, whom her father worked so h ard to obtain, and finds out that her sister is a mistress-lover to the King Henry. Anne is envious that so many do not like her, for her suspicious neck wart and extra finger, and she sets out to woo the King into her favor, but not for lusty appreciation; but to become queen! This book is exciting and I reccomend it for anyone who loves a good suspenseful and historical book."
4,A Good Book.....in time,"This book starts off rather slow and I was tempted to stop reading it. It's not as good as the other two, but just as vivid. You understand how one could have it all, then lose it all. NOt exactly a ""feel good novel"" with a ""warm and fuzzy feeling""."
3,A good climatic story!,I really think that Cameron would be better of writing romantic story... The basis of the story is excellent with a little imagination and reality mixed together and ending with a scare. This story is almost similar to the Mystery Date: Heart's Desire. Pendants both used and villians after it...
1,Don't buy unsupported equipment,"This unit has multiple gliches and problems that require an immediate downlod of sogtware. The maps are way out of date and it will cost 129.99 to buy the latrest ,ap series which is now 2 years old. Buying this product would be a serious mistake as there are many much better, that are cheaper and are up to date with their maps. The others also sell support for the maps with the unit."
1,Horrible DO NOT BUY!,"Unit does nothing but freeze and need to be restarted. I had to reset the unit out of the box several times. Nothing compared to pioneer S1. I never complain about anything but when something doesn't work you should know. I had several friends that had the pioneer S1 and had no problems. You think wow new S2 must be great, but it is a bad investment.I do not recommend this item."
5,Can Shipway compete with the Likes of Jarvi and Karajan in the DSCH 10th?,"Frank Shipway is not a name that I recognize doing any piece. In fact I took the advice of friend and tried to give listen based upon his recommedation. Shipway is excellent at building climaxes the first movement of the Shostakovich 10th. He beats Karajan by seconds in the speed he dispatches the orchestra in the second movement. The third movement holds it's own with the memorable horn calls. The final movement sounds improvistory without sounding confused. This is a true performance through and through. The Royal Philharmonic beats the Scottish National Orchestra under Jarvi and comes in a close second to Karajan's Berlin Philharmonic. The prices used at Amazon beat both Jarvi and Karajan. So I guess this goes in the ""Best Buy"" catagory.I would buy this again without hesitation if I had to. An excellent interpretation by an unknown conductor."
4,spank'n hot stuff,"this not why, when i go there are stars. please not stop when listen. oooo, lal la la nice and good. love cha"
3,Great program compatability issues,"My daughter loves science and LOVED this program. However, like another reviewer mentioned, it is NOT compatible with XP and after using the software for several weeks it refused to continue to work. If you don't have XP and your child likes science I would highly recommend this product."
5,XP Patch,You can get it to work on Windows XP if you go to this link and download the patch.http://www.learnatglobal.com/html/xp_sound.html
4,"""What is a triangle, but a heart with the grace taken out?""","This book was the basis for the excellent 1944 film starring Alan Ladd and Loretta Young. The story concerns a wealthy young woman who contracts viral menengitis and subsquently goes deaf, and the efforts of a brash young doctor who attempts to cure her.""And Now Tomorrow"" is a great beach read; it keeps your attention and even though it clocks in at almost 400 pages I read it in a day and a half. The story is engrossing, and the description of a small town and the changes that come to it is excellent.My only quibble is the disposal of my favorite character halfway through the novel. Other than that, this is a great book that was once very popular but has now slipped into obsurity. Worth checking out.GRADE: B (B+ if you haven't seen the movie and don't know what's coming.)"
3,It was ok,I was expecting a more captivating book. I seemed to remember that I like it more a long time ago when I first read it. Not a bad book though.
4,"""The Things That Define Our Lives"" ~ Faith & Higher Mathematics Merge Under The Aurora Borealis","Synopsis: Elderly man living alone searches for proof of God's existence within the scientific discipline of mathematics. Dying of an incurable disease, his time is short so he calls upon the child he gave up to adoption years ago. Now a grown man with a family of his own he decides to meet his birth Father for the first time in the hope that he can help him out of a bad financial situation. An unlikely familial bond is formed and the race to find the divine equation is begun now pursued by both father and son.`The Theory of Everything' released in '05 is one of the better Christian movies available today. The gospel message is present but it's not overpowering so the movie can be watched and enjoyed without feeling pressured to convert. It also provides a nice, basic introduction to the world of quantum physics, particle theory and the concept of a ten dimensional universe."
4,A GOOD MOVIE.,"THIS MOVIE MOVED VERY SLOWLY AND I WAS CONVINCED IT WOULD BE A DONATE MOVIE WHEN IT ENDED, BUT WAS SURPRISED HOW IT DEVELOPED AND ENDED. A KEEPER AFTER ALL."
2,material breaks down in sun; designed to fail,"Had this in my pickup for about 3 years and it's brittle now with cracks the whole length of it. Before it started cracking, the vinyl coating was getting hard and the lock wouldn't bite but could easily be slipped down and that started within the first year. I still use it because it ""looks locked"" but now i'm shopping for a replacement. Don't think they don't know what sort of plastics they use in items. They don't want you to have to buy another sooner than later of course."
5,Great Lock. Tons of applications,"This lock has done a great job so far. I've used to lock my kayaks to the roof of my car, lock my bikes onto my car and have wrapped it around a gun case for extra security. It's been absolutely incredible, and at the price you can't beat it.The only minor downside is the tip of the cable. It's either metal or a hard plastic. I worry about it scratching my car, but if you pay close attention to looping it through the rack, it becomes a non-issue."
2,Not theft proof.,"Put this cable on my brand new trail cam, which was also in security box. 3 days later I discovered the whole thing stolen. I figured the box could be ripped from the tree, but I thought the cable would hold. Apparently not. I don't know how they defeated the cable lock, but they did. Don't waste your money on this. If @$$holes want to steal your stuff, they're going to."
4,Python Cable for Trail Cams,"The cable appears sturdy enough. I purchsed the 6 x 3/8 in cable lock for my 10 gauge steel trophy cam security case. However, the 3/8 inch cable is too large for the security case holes. Soo, re ordered the 5/16 cable and this should work. The 3/8 cable appears super tough. I guess I could also drill out the holes to make them larger on the security case as an alternative option."
4,Motorcycle lock,"I got this to lock my motorcycle up when parked.It would not stop a determined thief by any means, but not much would, and I live in a fairly safe area. The length is good and lets me lock it to my porch or fence easily, as well as giving me plenty of length to lock it up just about anywhere I park. I'm pretty happy with the purchase and it makes me feel better to know my motorcycle won't be as easily carried away.If you have a nice bike that is at risk, you probably shouldn't use this as your only lock. This would also be a great lock to lock gear to your bike, but I generally carry mine so I haven't used it for that.One annoying issue is that the plastic (or rubber) key caps are coming off both the keys, but not enough so I can pull them off completely, just enough to bug me."
1,"Looks secure, really isnt","The good:I had locked 2 of my motorcycles together with this lock.Was intending to use it for my third motorcycle while out since it is fairly light and lengthyThe bad:Upon it sitting outside one night the lock was stuck, tried for a few minutes playing with the key to unlock it (ended up bending the key)The ugly:Sprayed some wd40 into the keyhole, some excess went onto the cable. Cable slips right out while still in the locked position."
4,Motorcycle Gear Lock,"I purchased this in order to lock my helmet and jacket to my bike. I run this through the passenger bar, through my helmet, and through the glove of my jacket and then re-lock it. The length is just about perfect for this use, and it locks/unlocks/cinches very easily. I carry it around in my backpack when I go to school, and it coils very easily. It comes with a velcro strap to keep it coiled, but it isn't attached to the lock and so I soon stopped hassling with it. Therefore, it can be a bit cumbersome trying to stuff it into a backpack and keep it from taking up much room. Besides this minor compliant I love it and recommend it."
4,Snake lock is handy,I like this Master lock python. I lock all my video cameras to trees with this lock when I video deer and other wildlife. I've not had one camera stolen with this lock securing it. It makes a good bicycle lock too.
1,Remixes' CD,"This double CD contains remixes of the original songs though sung by the original artists. The worst part of it is that the CD itself doesn't indicate this. All tracks are listed as ""originals"" except ""Muscle Man"" by Amanda Lear and ""Words"" by F.R.David where the CD producer was honest enough to say it was a ""Remix"". Most tracks sound quite different from the original versions (worse, in my opinion). Some tracks overlap by as long as 10 seconds so if you want to hear just a particular song, you might as well just start listening to the previous one since by the time the track is played it is already in the middle of its ""foreplay"". But, then again, if you like remixes and fast pace you'll probably enjoy it."
4,A beautiful treatise on melancholy,"I found Schwenger's model of melancholy, locating it in the tensile space between self and other, drawing on Freud and Lacan, to be utterly compelling and persuasive. I am an author who is writing academically for the first time about creating and I was very moved and inspired by this beautifully written, approachable book. From a personal point of view, being very interested in childhood poetics, I would have loved to have seen more attention paid to toys and Winnicott's concept of the transitional object in terms of melancholia, but I understand there are always limitations in any work. I do love the way Schwenger writes - it's a dream narrative in its own right."
3,the quality,"some parts at the ending is freezing, I don't know if it will happen to all the DVD player, but anyway the movie is good."
3,Row your boat,"Obviously, this movie has not been edited very well because it is a screener's copy. I think, actually, that JBJ does some of his best acting because it is so out of character for a rockstar. There is real tragedy here but the ending is so unrealistic that it takes away from the heartbreak of these two people and the sacrifices one is willing to make for someone you truly love."
4,Jon was Great,"I purchased this movie purely knowing that Jon Bon Jovi had a lead roll. Being from Australia this movie is not available here, so I purchased it through Amazon blind, knowing very little about it (pretty risky). Jon is pretty convincing as an ex con trying to go the straight and narrow. Mixed in with a soppy love story is always a winner with me. Highly recommended viewing, those dreamy blue eyes just reel you in, if nothing else the perve value was worth the extra cost (with the exchange rate being so poor). I'm happy to have this movie in my home movie collection."
3,A Good Film,"Iv'e only seen the VHS version of this, but it's a good film, that should have got some kind of Cinema Release. It's got a good story line, and some good performances, especially from Jon Bon Jovi, who continues to impress as an Actor. If only somebody would take a decent shot on him, and give him a role in a film with a budget. The only thing that let's this film down is the slightly improbable ending, but if you like a bit of a weepy, this films for you."
3,a decent book on building trelises,"This book provides some measured drawings and information about what types of plants work with trelises. The plant information is good and the drawings are decent, however, they do leave some important measurements out. I have built two trelises for family and friends and they LOVED them. If you can get by with just the basics then this book is useful."
1,ABSOULTE JUNK!!,No sense in repeating everything that has already been stated what is wrong with this POS. Just do a Google search for Presario 700 notebook. IT'S A TOTAL LEMON! WHEN DO WE SUE ...? Overheats Constantly - it's a design problem. Slower than a 386! JUNK! AVOID! I WASTED (money) HARD EARNED DOLLARS DOWN THE DRAIN!TOTALLY USELESS! DAMN IT!
2,"Overheats and Freezes, Fails and Locks up.","The title says everything. Other reviews I have read explain my situation perfectly. It overheats and freezes much too frequently. I understand that an occasional lockup is to be expected, but this is ridiculous. It happens at least once a day.The 1.4 GHz Athlon is great... when it actually runs up to speed. I still like the AMD, but other hardware issues have plagued my Compaq.As we speak, my Compaq is in the hands of Best Buy. Thankfully I purchased the warranty, because the power supply completely broke and needs repairs.Heed the warning and do not buy a Compaq. Go Dell!Compaqs are cheap and unreliable."
2,Why do I give this laptop only two stars?...,"...because it OVERHEATS way too much. Although the hardware and specs are nominally desirable, in practice I can't finish any of my high-end, video-demanding games because after a while, it heats up, then locks up! VERY FRUSTRATING!! I can't believe that the Compaq engineers and beta testers were aware of this problem. It didn't take me long to discover it!"
1,Presario 700,I can not work with My Presario 700. It just freezes a lot of times during the day. According to Compaq technical service: is a problem in the model. SO it can not be solved. Before buying a presario my advice is to ask or check on Internet about the problems the model presents.I will never buy a Compaq.
1,My Compaq Computer Overheats and Shutsdown after 10 minutes,"I will never buy another compaq notebook. This one i barely used for about 20-30 hours, and compaq will do nothing to help me other than send me to a service center. They want 100 bucks an hour just to diagnose it. Ha - never again Compaq!"
2,This is an Embarrasment For Compaq Sucks BWare,"First i would like to mentioned that what drew me towards a compaq notebook. Was that I had a compaq desktop running on NT and I was very Impressed because till this day I have not had a problem.Anyways I thought I would have had the same craftsmanship with a Labtop by Compaq. It was very appealing and had nice features.This machine started to give me problems right away it kept shutting down and overheating and lagging. Like it was running Pentium I or something it took for ever to start after powering up. I should had known, what are the odds the day I purchased this labtop a customer was bringing one in for service.This is the worst investment I have ever made. And I feel that I have been ripped off and someone or all of us need to get together so that we can get new computers from Compaq at their cost."
1,NEVER!,"If you are a Freddy Fender fan NEVER touch this CD!Thay have to wash an old LP and the sound would be BETTER!I can say to the people from AIM Records ""You made me a fool"" having this CD.Great music-AWFUL sound!"
4,Interesting and unusual top 10 lists for basketball,"This book of top 10 lists is a basketball fans dream; the lists cover everything from the usual to the unusual. Some examples of lists are:*) Greatest college players*) Playing politics - basketball players that ran for public office*) Touching all bases - basketball players that also played baseball*) Field goals - basketball players that also played football*) The name game - players such as ""Tony Dunkin"" with names that are linked to basketball*) Small packages - successful players that were less than 5'10"" in height.*) College's greatest games - a list of the 10 best college games ever played*) Like father, like son - a list of father-son combinations that played in the NBA.The best sports facts books are fun to read and this is one of them."
1,"If the DVD is so great, why the fake reviews?","WARNING: all 5 reviews of this DVD obviously are fake, as the reviewers' account names clearly are bogus, and none of the reviewers ever reviewed anything else. Why an attorney would have to create fake reviews in support of a DVD regarding a subject in which she purportedly has such great skills and experience is beyond me. Buyer beware."
3,More of the same - okay stuff but repeated,I really like Eldridge and what he has to say about the things of the heart and the spiritual side. This one seems like the marketers at his publication company must be trying to mild the gravy train and they got me but I'll be careful the next time. If you are a reader of Eldridge then all in this book are just excerpts from previous works so not good. If you are a first time reader then it is worth the price.
5,great litter!,This is the only stuff we'll buy (we have 3 cats)... it clumps well and the dust kicked up is kept to a minimum in comparison to MANY other brands we've tried.
2,Major Dust Combined With Sickly Perfume,"I can't believe all the glowing reviews for this product. It's creepy. Clouds of dust drift upwards whenever you gently run the scoop through it. The dust then settles on every surface of the room. Not to mention your hands...well ok, let's mention them. I scrub my hands after using this stuff and I swear the sickly sweet perfume odor cannot be washed off! My hands stink of grandmother perfume for an hour afterwards as though I had been building sand castles on a cat litter beach. And this is just from touching the scoop and being in the vicinity of the ominous dust cloud. Yikes. At least when strangers visit they don't immediately comment on your owning a cat. No, instead it's ""Oh does your grandmother live with you? And what's up with all the white powder? I thought people quit that stuff back in the '80s."""
1,What Wrong?,"The retail product price for this item is $12.95, not $57.00. Is this a package of 4? 6? It's a good product and I use it for my 2 cats, but if anyone buys this ""deal"" for one 14-pound container, they are getting a very raw deal."
3,Inexpensive And Pretty Good,"As far as scoopable cat litter goes, this one is slightly above average. It clumps well and does a decent job containing odors. A 14 pound jug lasts for about a month, if you have just one cat.Dust is a bit of an issue but not as much as with, say,Cat's Pride Scoopable/Flushable Litter, which had large amounts of dust when I have used it in the past.This Tidy Cats will get the job done, but all in all,Fresh Stepis the way to go. Fresh Step is more expensive, of course, but as with all products you get what you pay for... your nose will thank you."
1,Buy ANY other Book,"Hard to use and poorly laid out. Doesn't list attractions and restaurants by neighborhood, so you are out and about but you can't find a recommended restaurant in the area. Very frustrating. This book is best used to hold the hotel door open while the bellman unloads your luggage. If you go to Boston, have fun!...but DON'T BUY THIS BOOK. Froemmer's does it better in their sleep."
2,"So-so content, hard to read","Like most Dummies books Boston for Dummies has neither in-depth content nor genuine humor. What it does boast of is a low price. There is a lot of information in the book -- information you can also find online for free or in other guide books. My personal favorite is the award-winning ""The Rough Guide to Boston,"" which features better writing and better editing than this one. If you are visiting Boston or plan to go to school there, get the Rough Guide to Boston to take advantage of everything the city has to offer."
3,Adequate General Overview,"I was surprised to see other reviewers having such a strong dislike for this travel book, though I can see their points. I've been to Boston once before, and I'm not sure this book would make as much sense to someone who hasn't already been to beantown.I found the hotel information to be the most helpful. And the book is sprinkled with many practical, locals tips.The restaurant section was ok, but the recommendations didn't seem very diverse and (as one other reviewer pointed out) things aren't laid out by neighborhood unless you look at the one page index at the end of the chapter.This book coupled with active internet searches works well. Many of my searches began from links found in the book.Alternatives to this book that I can recommend are both the Frommer's 'Boston' or their 'Irreverent Guide'. Both are solid with good tips for the first time traveler."
3,Not as good as the rest,"I read the first book of the series and was drawn into buying the rest. However I didn't really enjoy this book as I did the rest, Personally I think the Coo-hatch are just weird... I kinda think its been dragged out too long, 8 books is a lot."
4,Another good book,"I would have to say that so far this was my least favorite book. Don't get me wrong though, I still enjoyed it.This books has the group leaving Olympus in order to find Senna's mom in Egypt. They must find Senna's mom so she can send the Coo Hatch back to there own world so they'll agree to quit making weapons for the Hetwan. They make it to Africa where they meet Eshu. He turns out to be a ""speaker"" for the African gods and claims that they must make a sacrifice to please the gods. The majority of the group is against this and so Eshu sends them through many perils. One of them is sending to a world where everything is upside down. There they meet some of there Viking friends. Can they make it out of this world alive without having to make a sacrifice?"
4,This is easily the best new series out there!,"With the new Everworld comes a host of new problems- includingAfrican gods, ""Dancing spider-monkeys"" and a world thattakes vertigo to new heigths. I think that the new idea that ""bleeeding"" between universes occurs- the idea that stuff in both universes is connected."
5,wow,"Even though this is my first time reading any everworld books, I am already hooked to them. I loved animorphs, so that means I loved everworld. If your tired of waiting for new books to come out, just get this one while your waiting! I really recomend it!"
4,This is a pretty cool book.,"This book happens after the heroes' conflict with Ka Anor (#6) and with Olympus (#7). In this one, they somehow go to an African-like place in which they encouter many strange jungle beings and the alien metal-smiths the ""Coo-hatch,"" one of which is featured on the cover of this book. I say read the other Everworlds before this, but this one is cool."
3,Books for boys,Most YA series are for girls. A few are almost gender neutral.I recently finished #8 and am pleased the the character development over the arc of the series. We will see if the authors can maintain.The aliens are a bit weird. I wonder if they come from a fictional or movie tradition I am not aware of.
5,Ben Heppner Delights Once Again.,"Ben Heppner is Pheonominal, and this CD is a tribute to his flexibility, and artistry. The CD will be accessable to a wider audience because of the music sung. I recommend this CD both to opera afficionados, and those who like broadway, easylistening, or just good singing. Each song is beatifully sung and well thought."
3,Property class,"The book itself is fine, after buying it however the prof. told us there are better supplements out there so I regret buying this one"
3,Chords and Scales book,"good book for beginners basic info on chords and scales, however it is a bit basic and the beginner will find the book not very useful after a month or less. If you are considering this book, you are probably serious about learning and if you are learning theory you will zip through this info quickly.I like the book, but if you are serious look for a bigger more in depth book. If you just want something light and basic go for this. It does have a good list of most used chords though.I have also purchased guitar 1, guitar 2, and the guitar songbooks from this ""fast track"" series. The guitar 1 and 2 fast track instruction books are great! Highly recommended, the best I've gone through. Song book 1 and this chord book, not so much."
4,4/25/76 Music Hall Boston Massachucetts,"This is a good show, The opening track is splendid. This CD really captures the esssence of Marley in his prime."
1,I wanted answers!,"I'm glad I ordered this book used for only $0.27. I know it says in the title ""The Book of Questions for Parents-to-Be,"" but I didn't realize that it was a book of questions without answers. It is basically a book of 500 questions to discuss with your partner. I thought it was a Q&A. So, you would like this book if you need some help thinking of parenting issues to discuss with your partner before trying to conceive. However, if you are like me and looking for an informative book about having kids, keep looking!"
4,Good for discussing parenthood before it happens!,"This book reminds me of others that people read when they're getting married--it's just questions to consider and learn more about what your spouse/significant other thinks about raising children. There is a lot that you don't learn until you have kids, so it's helpful to know if there might be areas where your philosophies diverge!I think this book is really solid if you and your spouse want to explore different topics about parenthood before actually having a child."
4,Good Read,"I had read ""Good Morning Midnight"" by Chip Brown relating Guy Waterman's life. I was interested in Laura's story. It was a good read, kept my attention and give new information about their chosen lifestyle."
2,Deeply Disturbing,"Although this book has many interesting moments, overall it was quite disturbing. That the author/wife allowed and enabled Guy's (husband's) suicide makes one question her motives. Was she so very angry? Had she so lost her own sense of self? The deeper family issues are glossed over in part as well. Two of Guy's sons were also suicides. Instead of requiring that her husband get help, she allowed him to disintegrate into his own depression and, indeed, she knew quite well when he was going to kill himself. I don't want to blame the ""victim"" but I do question the decisions she made."
5,Incredible detail for artists and illustrators,"As an artist, long have I looked for books helping to graphically show in simple detail elements of architecture. Perfect for medieval to pre-industrial societies, designing literally everything structural. A must resource for village and city design, if only there were more like this. Less text, tons of graphics, all straight and simple, clean lines, clear and useable well thought out pieces for difficult puzzles."
3,Doesn't include measurements,"I guess I expected measurements, but not sure why I had that expectation. The drawings are detailed and what I was expecting, though small to fit so many onto a page. This should be a good reference for what I need."
3,not meet my need,"I find I can't install it to my bike. The shape doesn't match. Anyway, it's not the fault of the seller. However if they can offer a more detailed manual, it'll be better."
3,don't get it,"i've watched two different versions of this play and still can't see what the fuss is about. yes, rosalind is a charming character, but the main storyline is limp, and the secondary storyline is far too weak to be a serious contrast of corrupted courtly life versus virtuous idyllic existence. the fool is sometimes funny especially in his courtship of the young lass, and jaques the 'philosopher' has some nice lines, but the whole thing goes nowhere. i need to read this play to see what i'm missing. but based on my two viewings, i don't get it."
1,what?,I didn't understand it. Why do we read these books for summer vacation. I can read regular books and enjoy them but if you're not a huge play writer fan than why read it if you can't understand it?
4,"Although it is a little bit gooey, it still is great writing","If you are not familiar with ""As You Like It,"" you should know that it is a very mushy book. That isn't to say that it isn't worthy of the unparalleled William Shakespeare, but you may want to take the general tone of the book into account. I will say that the play is very unique and very interesting when the substance of the plot comes through. As with anything by Shakespeare, this is ultimately worth getting."
2,annoying,The content of this book is probably ok. I was really disapointed with it as I have been to Nanchang and was really looking forward to someone elses experience of the city and of course their adoption process. The problem I have with it is that it is very badly written. I realise that being a writer is not this guys job but how it was printed like this is beyond me. I can get over grammatical mistakes and bad punctuation to a point. This book is written so badly that at times it is very difficult to get the meaning of sentances. The author changes tenses mid paragraph while talking about the same moment of time. Two stars for effort and putting the story down on paper.
5,Love dis woman!,"This was one of my first intros to reggae - fabulous! Diana King is soulful, energetic and makes you want to get up and move. She has plenty of attitude as well! Every woman should have this cd!"
3,Good,"I found this lying around at home. I listened to it and thought"" Not bad, not bad at all"". The only song I knew of Diana King was "" Shy Guy"" which was probably the only song she was known for.She has quite a strong voice, but all the songs kind of have the same vibe. My favourites are Love Yourself, Say A Little Prayer, Still and Wicked.Good for chillin out to."
1,Think Like A Girl Cd Is USED,"I Order a Cd Diana King ""Think Like A Girl"" Amazon sent me a used Copy, I Was not happy about &&& it dose not work properly. The Cd take to long to load & it sticks during play back. I tried it couple of times I clean it STILL the same problem. The price posted I believe because it was a over Ten years that cd was a discount priceI put it in the gabage because I believe it will cost me more money than I buy it for to contact Amazon & plus send it back."
5,Great ball for Goldens,"my dog loves these balls, used to like tennis balls, but once I gave her these she only wants to play with them....indestructible, floats in water, perfect for goldens..."
5,rca cable extension,I bought this item so I could run sound from my computer to my TV. It works great! The sound comes in perfectly.
2,low quality,"i needed this cable for the x-540 speakers, so i bought this extension based on the good reviews is getting. only to find out is really low quality, the cables itself doesn't look strong but i didn't really care and connected my speakers with it, when i played my music, i found out the speakers only played halfway-loud comparable to when using it with out the extensions. i'm very disappointed , its not worth your time to return it."
4,Works as described,Works as described.Use it for speakers for a TV that doesn't have audio out w/ an XBox 360.
4,Simple Cable,"What else is there to say? It's a basic cable extension. It worked fine for me. Have been using it here and there, and I have not noticed any degradation of the sound I used to have. Works well enough."
4,Works fine,I used this as an extension for my rear speakers in my surround system. There is no noticeable noise or distortion. The male ends don't grip super well and have slipped and disconnected once.
1,Don't buy,"Good price but complete waste. Over heats really bad, pixel went out within 3 weeks, Compaq's tech support knows less than me ( and that is sad) and left me on hold forever. Thank GOD circuit city let me return the piece of [junk] and buy an HP ze 5170. Much better computer--lot more money but worth the peice of mind. I will NEVER buy Compaq again!!"
4,"Low Cost Laptop, reasonable performance","I have had my 720us laptop for about 15 months and have had very little trouble with it. The battery is somewhat limited to about 2 hours max, and it does get warm on the bottom, but not nearly warm enough to melt the case, etc. as I saw on anothers post.I have had no maintenance problems with it, no overheating, no shutting down (unless the battery is weak)and I have had it running on AC for days at a time over the weekend, and I use the battery almost daily through the week, in the car.All in all, I am satisfied with this computer that only cost me about $900 after rebates, and would buy it again."
1,A Real Headache!,"There is a real hardware problem on all 720US notebooks, This computer turns off at any moment, compaq service changed motherboard, memory, and battery, and still dont' tell me whats wrong, it's been 3 months and still I haven't received my computer back.-"
1,waste of time an money,"My fiance and I were required to read this book & do the workbooks as part of our pre-marital counseling. We will never get that wasted time or money back! This book is super cheesy, lame and obvious. We hated every minute of this crap."
3,Too compact,"The guide is too small to cover all of Turkey. I was expecting something a little bigger and with more information. It just covers the basics, but if you do a basic search of Turkey on the internet you'll get more information for free."
2,Read the instructions carefully,I've used others that are better. If you're not careful you'll wind up with a lumpy sticky mess. Try and mix this with the liquid prior to inserting it into the rice mixture.
2,For car use only....,"As another reviewer stated, it doesn't work at all unless attached to a huge metal surface like your car. The product details don't mention this. I figured I could find a workaround to get it to work indoors, like attaching it to a cookie sheet. Somehow this antenna actually decreases gain when used this way. I can't get it to work and have no desire to sit in my car to use the Internet."
5,Range boostomatic!,"This puppy delivered. It took a marginal signal at work and made it reliable. I am using it now, when before I was unable to keep a stable signal. I work un a remote spot and the wifi signals here are blocked and usually don't show up past 1 or 2 db. This antenna now brings in a signal that is 6 to 10 db. What more do you want from it?"
4,Great resource for prospectful owners,"Lots of good information, well presented, easy to read. Somewhat outdated maybe, but the overall bottom line is the same and well presented. I will recommend this book to others, along with other books in the series by same author."
3,Meh.,"Amazing ""sucking"" power, but the extender cord that comes along with it is pretty dinky, flimsy, and short. It doesn't work very well without the cord/attachments. The duster attachment works well, however. The vacuum overheated quickly and was pretty loud for such a small machine."
3,Bad choice for single but cool live tracks.,"""My Plague"" was one of the weakest tracks on Iowa already, but this remix is just plain horrible. The only good thing about the original was the singing in the chorus. Well for the remix, they edited the song and made it shorter. the only good thing is they changed some of the screaming to singing. The live tracks are some of the best live Slipknot tracks I have ever heard though. The video is also kind of cool. It's from the Resident Evil soundtrack so ther's lots of creepy zombies. Decent for a single. The wait and bleed single is their best single though. Download this. You can watch the video on the Disasterpieces DVD."
3,slipknot,over the summer i saw the music video and i thought it was great but untill i borrowed the iowa cd and listin to the cd virson that was even better. i still listen to the movie verson becaues i have the movie on dvd so i going to save money to get the real cd so i can hear the orignal i still like the song both ways
3,"The facts, no theme","The Founding of Juneau feels dated. The facts are efficiently presented, but lack a narrative or theme. Regardless, if you are interested in the early years of Juneau (1880-1882), then by default The Founding of Juneau is a must read. The verbatim inclusion of historical documents including the charter of the Harris Mining District and the courts ruling against Harris save a trip to the Juneau historical library.The highlights are (1) legend of the ""Rocker"" claim, (2) character assassination of Richard Harris, and (3) description of what minor endured to mine their claim in the Silver Bow Basin."
2,Mildew-prone?,"I like this brush because the size is large enough to hold easily, and the bristles are stiff. It pains me to complain, but for some reason these brushes grow an orange mildew in about 30-40 days. I don't recall seeing this with other brushes I've had. I went through a dozen of these in about one year for that reason. Don't think I'll buy more until they fix this problem."
4,"Durable, functional, good looking stick!","A good looking tire gauge with a 1/4"" square stick and easy to read numbers. My only problem with it, so far, is seating it on the tire valve to take a pressure reading. It is sometimes tricky to do because it's on an angle. But, other than that, it's good value for the money!"
3,A Buccaneers Review,"The Golden Earring is a Dutch band that plays various types of music styles , from accoustic to bluesy to rock and even heavy rock sounding music. This album is not one of the best ones from this band , but overall it sounds good.The soft sounds of 'Going To The Run' and 'Pourin' My Heart Out Again' , the smooth rock sound of 'In A Bad Mood' and the more boosting rock sound of 'Planet Blue' make this album worth to listen to."
1,Disappointing quality from Wilson,"We ordered two of these supposedly better-quality game balls. On both of the balls, the leather was cut so poorly under the lacing that the lacing itself was crooked. The leather sat-up off the bladder creating what would appear to be air pockets or pimples under the leather. This condition was particularly bad on the stitching under the lacing. On one of the balls, other stitching aside from those under the lacing was also bad, and this area, too, had small bubble-like pimples. This ball would not even hold air."
1,Poor Fitting Composite Cover,My son is a kicker and punter and the fit of the ball is very important. This ball has a loose fitting cover and has an odd shape from typical high school footballs.
2,Poor Football,"The long seams on this football were bumpy. The ends of the ball where the four pieces come together were not alligned, and the laces of the ball did not run straight. In my opinon this product should not have passed quality contol."
4,"Yeah, OK, George Bush... Whatever!","I'm guessing ""George Bush"" never heard of the Sidewinders/Sand Rubies. The afore mentioned (actually one band at different times)were the vehicle for Maryanne's David Slutes' vocal talents in the '80's & 90's. This album was a welcome comeback for Slutes, whose only other work since the Sand Rubies that I'm aware of was an album with Little Sisters of the Poor. Your First, Your Last, Your Everything was followed by an EP of four songs, including live versions of 30 Day Diary(a Little Sisters number) & Wretched Song, an alternate version of Horoscope and a cover of Dylan's Isis. I've been reading that the Sand Rubies are working on material for another album. It'll be great to experience the David Slutes & Rich Hopkins chemistry again!"
3,Brushes,"Good quality brushes. haven't used them in a performance, but in practice, they work fine. They are a little stiff, but definitely doable."
4,Just Right,I gave this to my son for Christmas and it was just what he wanted! He likes the weight and feel of the brushes as well as the sounds he is able to make with them. I would recomend this to a friend.
1,Amazon packs with mental midgets,"The case is a case. It's plastic. If it arrives intact, it's great. I've ordered 6 cases from Amazon. There is someone in their shipping department who seems to have been deprived of a cerebral cortex. Both times they ship three packs (my order quantity) in a cardboard box, without padding. I average 10-15 totally destroyed cases of each 150 ordered. Figure you'll loose 5 from the mental midget who does the shipping. Deduct that from your savings."
3,Damaged cases in shipping,"As posted by others, the shipping person at Amazon is a total hack!One piece of paper in a box containing 5 fifty packs... I easily lost about 10 jewel cases, bottom of box was partially open and torn, but still, overall, a good deal.Got it in 24 hours, no charge for shipping! They charge $1 more per fifty pack than others and I lost about $2 worth of cases, but still cheaper than Walmart and others.You get what you pay for... or don't pay for. Work on your shipping Amazon!"
3,Product Fine - Shipping Ridiculous,The cases I received were fine. They all arrived unbroken and are good quality. I paid $9.10 for the cases and they charged me $13.95 for shipping. That is the last time I do the one click checkout!
3,We agree - poor shipping talents at Amazon for this one,"We've received three damaged shipments already. As another reviewer stated, the shipping department is out to lunch when it comes to shipping this item. Jewel cases were in a box with a lame piece of paper - what a joke! The jewel cases arrived broken, three times now! When will then learn? After the last return - the fourth shipment arrived safely. The jewel cases are great, but just be prepared to contact Amazon regarding poor shipping and handling."
3,Jewel cases,I messed up when I got these as I actually wanted thin cases not the standard size. When they arrived I found three of them were damaged.
1,Product was faulty... still got charged a restocking fee,BuyGPSNow sent me the SD wifi card which made my IPAQ 6515hw start rebooting every minute when I installed it. It had never done this in the past and it would stop the moment I take the card out. I returned the card on time and they still charged me 15% restocking fee because they claimed they did not see anything wrong with the card. This card cost me almost $40 and they credited me only $30... basically I lost $10 doing business with them. Save your money and don't buy from them... try from other resellers.
1,bad choice!,"This item does not come with any directions, and is not very user-friendly. I wiggled my way around to get this item installed on my handheld, only to have it not work. ...proved to be worthless for me."
1,SDIO CARD,"I can't review this product because: I ordered a SDIO card for a PALM PDA. I received a card for Windows products.I was not able to return it for the correct one, nor contact the the source to request an exchange, because there was no documentation with the product & no contact information. The product came from over seas."
2,Flaky Performance,"Software is flaky. You pop the card in, and sometimes the software comes up and sometimes it doesn't. And, if you remove it, forget about putting it back in and getting it to work without restarting your phone by removing the battery..."
1,Does not work with the Dell Axim x5,"I can echo the fact that this card does not work with the Dell Axim x5. In fact, I found a blog on the subject that states ""the SD slot on the Axim x5 is not compatible with SD10 cards"". I'm getting ready to email the company for return authorization. There should be no restocking charge but I'm sure there will be."
3,Bland,They changed the recipe and I personally thought it was really bland and tasted like something was missing. I used to get this alot but not any more.
4,LETS PUT THIS IN PERSPECTIVE....,"THIS IS,INDEED,A 4.0/4.5 STAR RATED ALBUM.SOLID,ROCKING RELEASE WITH NO ""FILLER"".BUT IS IT REALLY BETTER THAN SLICED BREAD??NO,IT IS NOT THE GREATEST ALBUM OF ALL TIME....SO RECONSIDER SPENDING 100 BUCKS ON THIS THING.IT WILL BE RE-RELEASED EVENTUALLY SO BUY YOUR mOTHER A NICE GIFT ON mOTHERS dAY INSTEAD"
5,Gets a lot of play!,Just a great group of guys that made music I really dig. Different for me cause I'm just now trying out the Stoner rock genre but very rewarding. Love the vocals and it so fits with the sound of the band. It worked!
5,Solid Rock,"I've been waiting for this one to come for a long time, and it didn't disapoint me. UNIDA has made an outstanding hard rockin' album. This is only the beginning of a soon-to-be great band."
3,Brief overview of the Tactical Shotgun,"Good overview of the tactical shotgun but tries to cover too much territory in such a short video. The first few minutes are a discussion of the Gunsite preferred shotgun configuration; stock, sling and sights. Other topics include: loading/unloading, mounting, carrying, patterning, types of ammunition, tactical considerations and dry fire practice.Jack Furr and Bill Jeans are the primary instructors. There are 34 minutes of instruction followed by a short dry fire practice session and closing comments for a total of 47 minutes."
3,Needs a plug in to work,"I received this item quickly and it was okay. I was hoping the games would be quick to start. I had liked the idea of tracking the indiviuals progress, but the student can't just log in and do them and quit whenever times is up. The program has a storyline to follow and you have to finish each section before you can log out and save. Also if you have Windows XP or higher you have to download the pluggin to be able to run the program at all. It was my fault for not checking the compatiablities before ordering it. This is just a heads up to those who want to purchase this item."
1,Don't be fooled,"Ok, so the audio link is free via the Gutenberg Web site and the reading of the novel is done so by a computer voice not a live person so it is awful to listen to. I wasted my money."
3,Okay,"I thought I was getting a ""like new"" book, but this book was a little beaten up and it had writing in the first few chapters."
5,my first e-book and I'm pleased,"Thought I'd start with a classic for my new Kindle Fire. Text size and spacing are adequate for my old eyes. I'm still learning how to use the Kindle, but I like the embedded dictionary - especially when reading a book like this. This book includes illustrations and appears to be complete. I'm not a literary expert, but it is entertaining. Some period specific references are unfamiliar, but you can still follow the story. I recommend it."
5,A Tale of Two Cities,"A Tale of Two Cities (Dover Thrift Study Edition)The Book graphically brings French revolution to your room. The characters are live and you start believing they are real historical figures. The underlying humor is compelling. You become the protagonist of the poor at the same time sympathizing with the victims. The ""Love"" is simply ideal, an unrequited one. You read and compelled to read once again after some days. The experience is totally different. I would rate this as one of the best historical novel ever read."
4,Tale of two Cities,"An old classic that never grows old. Unusual for Dickens and that makes it even more interesting. If you read it long ago, it is worth reading again."
2,Quality is not worth the price,"They cut, but they are not nearly as sharp or of the same good quality as others that are even cheaper than this one. At $9 I would definitely not buy this. I bought an Oster for $6. It is much more durable, the grip feels better in my hand, and it cuts better."
5,This book meant a lot to me,"I read this book at a young age, and many more times over the years. Mr. Piersall was gracious enough to sign my battered copy for me, and it remains in my personal library today. An honest look at how mental illness affects entire families."
4,Self Esteem Wins,"Fear Strikes Out tells the remarkable Story of Jim Piersall, Boston Red Socks player, who went through a breakdown that almost kept him out of baseball. It details his relationship of him with his distant father and the perfectionism Piersall developed as a result of his isolation. it is a wonderful book that uses careful writing to draw the reader into Piersall's life. However, if you are not a serious baseball fan it may be a slow read. It requires some knowledge of baseball and of mental illness.Obtaining this item from Amazon was very easy."
3,Pleasant suprise!,"The first I heard of Hooverphonic was a subsequent release called ""Blue Wonder Power Milk"". When I placed my order for ""A New Stereophonic Sound Spectacular"" I didn't realize that it wasn't the CD that I heard before, but I was pleasantly suprised when I received it and heard it for the first time. Catchy, poppy trip-hop. These songs are more in the pop genre than the kind of trip-hop you'd get from Massive Attack or Tricky. Hooverphonic has a female vocalist which seems to fit much better in this kind of music than male vocals in my opinion."
4,The only one worth buying,"Sadly, Hooverphonic is one of those bands that makes a terrific first album and then, well, goes all Pop on us. Perhaps it was the switching of female vocalists. Anyway, ""Sound Spectacular"" contains that trip-hop classic ""2Wicky"". The rest of the CD I would characterize as ""aggressive down-tempo"" rather than trip-hop. There is some great swirling momentum on ""Inhaler"", ""Wardrope"" and ""Revolver"". They try to get cute with some sound effects, but otherwise a great album."
4,Hoover phonic,"Well, this is one album I can sleep to at night. It contains an alixia of melody and abstract sounds that help you drift to subconsiousness. To compare Hooverphonic with styles it's similar to Mandalay\Single Sun Theory\ Wicked Beat Sound System. Hooverphonic have prooven quite a distinct, yet still underground, style that seems to develope within their own bounded parameters. Very underated in the scheme of things. Awsome album after a hard days work. The synth work and simple beats do them justice. It's a sweet and very mellow album for anyone looking for the music they want but can't find."
3,"Not for everyone, but still good","In the world of downtempo and trip-hop, I lean more towards Morcheeba and Portishead's first albums (Who Can You Trust? and Dummy, respectively) than others.Hoover, unfortunately, had the talent but didn't seem to know where to go. While a lot of tracks are very noteworthy (2 Wicky and Someone among others) a lot also fell short. They just didn't reach that crescendo of uniqueness that I was hoping for. Still, it's an interesting listen and worth buying, but I'd go with the albums I mentioned earlier first before this one."
3,So-So,"I thought I would check out this group out based on prior reviews, and perhaps it may need to be listened to a few more times but I guess I was expecting more."
3,not quite...,"""2Wicky"" was a song that grabbed my attention when i heard it played in a movie. utilizing a Joe Jackson sample, the song builds with a sinister kind of ease and has a dark noir feel to it. the remainder of the album is not quite as good as that song, but comes close. ""Barabas"" and ""Nr 9"" in particular keep a distinctively distant and cold vampy atmosphere. the biggest drawback to this album is the overuse of silly sampled voices talking about the novelty of ""hi-fi stereo sound"" and all that stuff. it just ruins some of these songs and makes the whole record come accross a little too tacky, in my opinion. overall, Hooverphonic's debut album is a minor gem in the overcrowded world of trip hop."
5,Blurb Review: Hooverphonic - a.N.S.S.S.,"A beautiful musically layered hybrid of lounge pop and trip hop, Hooverphonic's debut A New Stereophonic Sound Spectacular pushes the limits of smooth. The album is positively immersed in texture, which you can feel in the opening ""Inhaler"". As a whole, the album is a hypnotic journey with a few minor points of banality. Nevertheless, tracks like ""Nr.9"" and ""2 Wicky"" create enough atmosphere to make you shiver. Rating: A-"
4,2wicky put me off this album,"Its amazing when you like a genre and there is an artist who everyone says fits it and the commercial release is just sheer rubbish. Thats what I found with Hooverphonic. There track 2wicky is as boring as anything I have ever heard. However giving the album a chance, this has as many mind altering beats, basslines and sounds as any trip-hop album Ive heard in the past. Inhaler, wardrobe, barabas, cinderella and saranji are all trip-hop classics. Barabas could have benefited by more vocal and bass interpolitions like what occurs when the bass kicks in. That track is spoiled by excluding that harmonic rythum created in that small piece of the song. But there is an all impressive mood involved in all the above mentioned tracks and it is well worth the effort for any trip-hop head."
2,instrumentation has a nice atmospheric sound...,Belgium band with a very abstract offbeat sound. Some of the instrumentation has a nice atmospheric sound but the vocals make them sound like Everything But The Girl or The Cocteau Twins. Not my cup of tea.
3,Yuk,"I did not like this in the least. The female vocals were overly sappy and droll. ""Stereophonic Sound Spectacular"" is a joke. Total snoozer. Nothing interesting about this disc."
2,It could have been much more user friendly!,"Although it is a decent production, any appeal is lost here with no chapter breaks to frame the events in this huge historical review. ""Remarkable 20th Century..."" becomes a tedious beast to manuver through, unless you intend to watch each decade/chapter all the way through, and who does that with a reference production like this? You'll navigate to a topic,fast-forwarding/rewinding much as you would have with a VHS format...so the technological advantages of the DVD format are lost. As a reference, considering that lack of any index... not only as a menu item, but no clues on the packaging either, these discs become even more mysterious, ponderous, and disappointing. For a user-friendly reference to 20th Century milestones, buy the Madacy product, and steer clear of this one unless you collect these sorts of things!"
1,It's not The Century: America's Time,"If you're looking for an excellent documentary covering the 20th century, choose The Century: America's Time hosted by Peter Jennings. This set will bore you to tears, and the narrator is not close to dynamic."
2,Too much info. Reviews year after year instead of taking the big items and doing them justice.,"This DVD's have too much information and not enough information on the most important happenings of the 20th Century. If you want to use these for a teaching aide, I would not recommend them. Instead, look into The Century: America's Time with Peter Jennings. He doesn't cover everything, but explains in detail how WWI and WWII affected the world; the depression; the newest happenings with the newest inventions, etc. His is very well done."
4,Good value for money,"This program is an excellent overview of the twentieth century. About one hour is devoted to each decade where all the major political events, social uphevals, scientific discoveries and major artists are mentioned. Includes plenty of interviews. Highly recommended and a good value for money."
2,"Strange book, not as good as Odd Girl Out","If you liked Odd Girl Out and really like Ann Bannon, don't bother with this one. Yes, it and the series it's part of are landmark works of lesbian fiction and it's worth the read for that reason alone. Still, that doesn't make it enjoyable. The forward by Ms. Bannon sheds a lot of light on why this book is as dark and self-loathing as this one is. Still, as I said before, it just wasn't enjoyable. It was angry and very bitter and quite sad, too. Lots of violence and very little empathy. Just a bunch of people at absolute rock bottom. This is understandble considering the time period, but I couldn't finish it. I ended up hating all the characters I loved - or at least tolerated - in the first two books."
5,Very pleased,"This movie is very funny. my whole family enjoys it, including my grand kids. We've watched it about five times and I am sure we will watch it many times more. It is a very good family movie. I chose the VHS because I thought that it would play in all machine. It shows very in mine."
3,Texas,"It was a hassle to change the format. I had recorded themovie from the western channel. In the scenes with the Commanches, english words (closed caption) were on the screen. But with this movie there is nothing."
3,"Funny, but dated","Some parts of this movie were hysterical, but I remember seeing it in the movies and laughing the whole time.....guess I've grown abit since then! Joey Bishop was great!"
3,Texas across the river,The movie was good but it had no credits at the end could have been a better copy.Actually I was kind of disappointed since it was for a gift and very hard to find.
5,Prove of particular interest to British residents and fans.,"Fans of British and London history in general and London transportation in particular will relish THE BUS WE LOVED: LONDON'S AFFAIR WITH THE ROUTEMASTER. The Routemaster is a shadow of its former self, today - but it's become no less revered the rarer it's become. It's a symbol to London, it's appeared in many a film about the city, and it here receives a history following its invention, evolution, and eventual fall in glory as a transit choice. This could be the story of any urban transit system - but will prove of particular interest to British residents and fans.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"
4,Destroyer action in the Pacific.,I found this an enjoyable book that gave an insight into everyday operations of a line destroyer.
4,Lifesaver,"These 2-way radios were a lifesaver for my wife and me as we traveled from Georgia to New Mexico in separate vehicles (UHAUL and car). The voice clarity and reliablity of this product allowed me to communicate with my wife along the journey with assurance and much more frequently than I anticipated!! We experienced car trouble along the way, so talking on the 2-way radios enabled us to make planned stops to recharge the car battery...despite tractor trailers whizzing by at high speeds throughout the day and night only a few feet away from us! The duration of the fully charged battery pack was about 16 hours (about 85% standby time). We remained within 1 mile of each other, so reception distance was never a concern. We both felt the quality of these radios saved us much grief and aggravation...and maybe even our marriage!...Hmmm...maybe I should reconsider...I mean getting a car charger for these fantastic radios!"
2,It's not all it says it is.,"I assumed the walkie talkies would work well after seeing good reviews.I just used these on a cruise with 6 other people and 26 miles is not even close to what we got, the farthest we could use these were at most 1 mile over open water, fully charged.Many times I couldnt even hear the others while on the same boat.Only at about 300 feet or less you can hear the other person pretty good, anything beyond 300 feet it gets very staticy or you can't hear them at all.Besides they are very bulky.A few times after charging it for 6 hours the battery would die out right away.The chargers are preety cool but they dont let you know when the walkie talkies are fully charged, you have to guess or look at the battery icon which is not the best indicator, considering it can show full and die an hour later."
2,Hyperbole,"It is my opinion that this product is much over-hyped. In order for this product to work for anything over one mile, one should expect SUPER optimum conditions; i.e. only flat land with no obstructions (trees, buildings, etc.). We've not been any place where we could even try something approaching a 26-mile range.Shipping costs, speed of delivery, care in packaging, etc. were all excellent."
1,not as they said..... :(,it said this product is great....but it's not :(it's hard to get an open signal and the battery only last an hour even we didn't use it.
3,Hard at 1st but Good Product,"I bought this for my kids to be able to roam around the baseball or football fields and still be in contact with me. It is easy to use once it is set up but I found it a little difficult to set up. Keep in mind, I have no technical skills whatsoever but still I wish that was easier. Although, it does get GREAT distance and has good volume."
3,range ok ?,i bought these walkie talkie about 3 years ago .range in town about a mile.batteries are still going strong
4,Midland Radio,Works as I expect. Reasonable range for neighborhood use. 2-3 miles with lots of obstructions present.
4,Midland GXT710 Works Well on The Road,"My wife and I purchased two Midland GXT710 2-way radios just before we took a trip from Delaware to Key West in separate cars. We wanted to be able to coordinate gas, food, restroom, overnight stops on the road without using our cell phones. We used only the FRS channels with a privacy code, since the owner's manual said GMRS channels require an FCC license. Most of the time we were within 2 miles of each other. We were also on I-95 most of the time, and rarely out of ""line-of-sight."" We only lost contact one time, and we were probably only 2-4 miles apart, and possibly on opposite sides of an ov erpass.We charged the batteries each night, and never had an issue with lack of charge.We will try them on a boat trip later this month.They worked great for road trip communication.I will check into FCC licenses to see how complicated/expensive that is. It would be nice to have the 26-mile range advertised on the water when one of is in port or on a dingy.Steve B"
4,"Work well, not waterproof","I bought these recently to use at the beach. One thing I did not pay attention to when ordering was that these are not waterproof/resistant. If I were to do it again, I would look for a water resistant set.They work well, but contact must be made without trees or hills in the way to cover any distance."
5,great product for the price,"these units are very easy to use,range is good but no way will it reach 26 miles"
2,Huge size turned us off,"I ordered these radios based on other great reviews, and to replace a set of Motorola radios we felt didn't last as long as they should.Upon opening the Amazon box, I was astonished to see how large these Midland radios are. Remember those old two-way radios you had as a kid? These are about the same size, and look just about as clunky!Our old Motorola units, although a bit larger than a cell phone, could easily be slipped in a pocket - there's no way in the world this Midland would fit in any pocket easily.Since we use these while working around the house, we need something small enough to easily carry.I'm returning these and looking for something a bit less bulky.Although Amazon is great, I do wish they would give dimensions on items like this - instead of just box dimensions. If I'd known the size before ordering, I definitely would have kept looking!"
2,Midland GXT710VP3 Two Way Radios With26 Mile Range,"Be very careful of what you are buying. It says up to 26 mile range under best conditions, what it doesn't tell you is if you are on a FRS Channel that you need to be on, because the other channels are restricted by the FCC. You can not set your levels to low, medium, High. High gets max miles and low gets least miles. Your Two way radio goes to low and the most distance we have gotten from our radios is less then 2 miles. This has been very disaponting to us. We weren't expecting 26 miles but we thought 8 to 10 would be good as our daughter lives about 7 miles away from us and she and her mother were going to use them instead of their cell phones all the time.Not to much use to us with that range."
3,useful but shorter than max range,"Main issue is the battery indicator does not work- it says full battery till ~an hour before it dies out and then it will say 1/3 battery bars and display ""lo"" battery. lots of channels and settings, also has weather alerts. good as short range but longer ranges >1mile are very hard to hear. 1 mile is about the maximum limit I get in suburbs. 26 miles is unreal in any setting."
5,Crumpler Bags ROCK!,"I have owned a Crumpler Wack-O-Phone laptop messenger bag for some years and have loved it so much that I even use it when I am not carrying my laptop with me. In preparation for an upcoming trip to I purchased a Barney Rustle Blanket messenger bag (in green) and have already started using it.The bag is stylish and roomy with a great zip pocket and three pockets inside the main compartment (one fastens with velcro). Crumpler's materials are sturdy and waterproof, the colors are bright and the bag is stylish.I have been able to stuff a small laptop, half a ream of paper, a paperback book, small notepad, compact umbrella, my eye glass case, cell phone and holder and various other personal items into the bag and am looking forward to taking the bag with me on the beaches of Aruba.Crumpler bags rock. No complaints and I will probably purchase a backpack at some point in the near future."
4,The Hits And More,"If you are looking for the hits of Billy Joel, this is the place. All of his major hits are here and in one place. There are no live cuts, no alternate takes, just song after song from one of the best musicians of the last 30 years.If you have some of his other CDs, you may quibble about some of the choices on the set. For example, I have a soft spot for ""Leave A Tender Moment Alone"" and that is not here. But that is minor.The 4th CD in this set is a gem, from his talks on the ""business"" of music, how records actually do get made. You get a feel for Joel as a person as he talks about growing up as he explains how and why he wrote songs such as Scenes, Vienna and Piano Man."
5,Wonderful music and interactives,"Music, insight and lyrics. What else do you want from any artist.Billy Joel delivers all that in this collection.Skip the individual albums and get this definitive volume.Very cool."
4,everything it should be,"I'm a Billy Joel fan, but it was my dad's music - so I don't know everything. This collection has everything you've heard before if you're like me. It has plenty of other songs that you haven't heard too, that are great. I'd recommend this to both avid Billy Joel fans, and people who just enjoy his music."
4,"Good compilation, but it always misses greatest hits!","Billy Joel is one of those composers/musicians whose music is always good, DAMN good! So, the problem with making a ""Complete Hits Collection"", is that one way or the other, it will always MISS GOOD SONGS!... Some of those missing in this one: ""Rosalinda's Eyes"" (52nd Street), ""C'Etait Toi (You Were The One)"" (Glass Houses), ""Leave A Tender Moment Alone"" (An Innocent Man)... In such case, there's no other way but getting his whole album collection... Surely a big expense, but consider that almost all of his albums have been reissued in ""Enhanced"" versions."
5,Place Joel in the Pantheon of American Composers,"Like only Gershwin and Berlin before him, Joel has given us a body of work that is unparalleled in excellence and taste. That critics and rock aficionadoes alike continue to lambaste him invoke comparisons to other misunderstood geniuses like Van Gogh and Conrad. One only needs to hear a few lines of ""We Didn't Start The Fire"" to appreciate the depth and wisdom of Joel's poetry. The metaphysical testimonies of ""Piano Man"" and ""Captain Jack"" only strengthen with time--perhaps they are the ""Paradise Lost"" or ""Inferno"" of our age. Joel's philosophical contributions to rock and roll would have left him on firm ground alone, but he fearlessly breaks new ground on issues of Catholicism (""Only The Good Die Young""), trends in style (""It's Only Rock and Roll to Me"") and proleterian lust (""Uptown Girl""). This album is imperitive to understanding mankind."
3,ONLY FOR AVID BILLY JOEL FANS,"Unless you are a die hard Billy Joel fan, this boxed set is not for you. It does not even live up to its name ""Complete Hits Collection"" because some of his hits have not been included notably ""Sometimes A Fantasy"" which was a top 40 hit and cannot as far as I know be found on any one of the numerous collections of Billy Joel retrospectives that have been issued over the years. For those of you who like his songs and would prefer a more handy and reasonably comprehensive collection I would recommend acquiring ""Billy Joel The Ultimate Collection"" which has 36 tracks including most of his hits. What's more, the lyrics for all the 36 songs are also provided and the sound quality is good too."
2,They Just Can't Get It Right,"Wow its not that hard people. What is here is good but where are Honesty and Leave A Tender Moment??? Inexcusable!!! Instead of a worthless 4th disc, just add those songs (and maybe a couple more like Miami 2017) and you'd have it right. The Essential CD is even worse!! Even with the 3.0 version you miss You're Only Human and Keeping the Faith. What a mess!!!!!"
5,amazing,This is as complete a billy joel album as you can get. all of the CDs are great and i especially liked the 4th disc how he explained how he came up with the lyrics to some of his songs.
5,A complete package for any music lover,"Billy Joel has been a mainstay in the contemporary music scene for over twenty-five years now and this box set explains why. Filled with his best and brightest, Billy Joel never lets the listener down. The remastered 'Honesty' is the best on the CD and 'I Go to Extremes' will still make you get on your feet. This box set is a must for anyone that loves good music!"
5,Joel at his popular best,"Any true Billy Joel aficionado knows that some of his best work never made the top forty, including Angry Young Man (with that incredible driving prelude), Entertainer (a good rip on the entertainment industry) and Root Beer Rag (his good time romp on the keyboard). However, this compilation pulls together some of his best known work and some of his most relevant. Thankfully including Vienna (another important but not commercially successful work) and Scenes from an Italian Restaurant, die hard fans will appreciate the fourth CD of the artist's ramblings while newbies have the enviable experience of getting in a New York state of mind for the first time."
2,Why?,"For what this costs, if you found a good sale, you could purchase most of his albums. You would then be the proud owner of ""Angry Young Man"", ""Ballad of Billy the Kid"", ""Summer, Highland Falls"", ""Miami 2017"", ""Honesty"", (insert your favorite)... none of which appear here. You would also own the full-length versions of ""Just the Way You Are"", ""My Life"", ""Pressure"", and ""Captain Jack"", instead of the truncations that DO appear here. Forgive me, dear marketing/repackaging people, but I simply cannot believe that the booklet or the bonus 4th disk could possibly justify the purchase of this set."
3,Great Selections from all his greatest hits volumes!,I'm sure you're going to love this complete Box Set collection taken of all Billy Joel's greatest hits volumes from 1973-1993 with three previously unreleased material. These songs are wonderfully fabulous because i've got these tunes on both cd's I have already. Expect for the third disc where it includes a college lecture interview which you could find it boring sometimes or interesting to listen often!
5,1973-97 Complete Hits Collection,"It has all the Billy Joel songs I remember and like, it is a great collection of his hits that I remember."
3,almost perfect... not even close,"I thought I finally found the complete Billy Joel hits collection, as this box set boasts. Please tell me where ""Sometimes A Fantasy"", ""Leave A Tender Moment Alone"" and ""Modern Woman"" are on this collection. All three were Top 40 hits. I would be more than willing to buy this if every Billy Joel hit were included. I guess I'll have to download tracks and make my own collection since the record company cannot get this right..."
4,"A good mix of his work, but not complete by any means","I like this collection, don't get me wrong. Billy Joel has had so many hits thru his career that it would take 10 disc min. to record them all. I first saw him in 73,74 at the ambassador theater in st. louis, mo. and was hooked on his music. I hope the ballad of billy the kid will be on his next hits cd, and more work from his early years from piano man and streetlife serrenade. But this set will do just fine for now. Excellent buy for all you get,including lyrics, and an inside look into the making of his music. Grab this set while it's still available for your library. Keep up the good work Billy, and may God bless all your endevours in life."
3,"Luther wright and the Wrongs, Rebuild the wall Pt #1","This is a good CD,I own over 130 'Pink Floyd' albums, but I wonder why my copy of 'Re-build the Wall' only has 13 songs on it, and not the 26 songs that is being sold"
2,"So, which member of the Floyd sold out?","Ironically, Roger Waters ok'd this blatant mockery of his work. At least when the remaining members of Pink Floyd reunited and went on tour, they stayed true to the music and the feelings therein. I will be the first to admit, as a lifelong Pink Floyd fan, that this travesty of musical imitation is HILARIOUS. I almost peed my pants laughing at Mother and Is There Anybody Out There. The gunshots were classic. However, I will never, ever be conned into buying this ludicrous piece of bluegrass garbage. The steel guitar taking over for the guitar solo in Comfortably Numb had me cringing in agony, and since when is Hey You an upbeat, foot stompin' barn dance number? The best description I've heard yet of this particular endeavor is that it is ""like bad porn... or a trainwreck. It's horrible, but you just can't tear your eyes away."" Or, in this case, your ears. Interesting concept, and the music and harmonies themselves are not bad, which is why I gave it two stars."
1,SMASH THIS WALL WHILE YOU STILL CAN!,"These moonshiner hillbillys demolished pink floyds classic into a goofy country CD! What was once a great album has been ruined by canadians!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! strange out of place lyrics ruin this brooding concept album. Whats worse is a perfectly good adaption, Out of Phase's The Wall 2000 is totally ridiculed by the Pink Flyod loyalists. I think haters of the The Wall 2000 should hear this trash and maybe they will understand what a cover album is about!"
5,These guys are artists.,The review on the title page... well that guy's a jag. This is a superb remake of a great classic.
3,Interesting concept,"Not as good as the Hayseed Dixie albums, still worth a listen. Some songs lend themselves very well to the country flavor, some do not. I would check out Hayseed Dixie's tribute to AC/DC and Tribute to Mountain Love before I ventured to this album."
4,Is that who I think it is?????,"So I'm sitting in an English pub in La Paz, Bolivia (hey its what I do)and I'm playing the drinking game with my buddies (the first person to name the artist that's playing say drink, and everyone does), and I hear ""Another Brick in the Wall"" come over the stereo. ""Pink Floyd, Drink!"" I shout. Only it wasn't Pink Floyd. There was some funky banjo noise, some steel guitar, and some Hillbilly singing. At first I groaned and lamented the ""massacre"" of classic music I grew up on. But then it grew on me and I knew I had to have it. This will go into my collection right next to Dred Zeppelin. I love it!"
2,just wondering,"i believe it is this movie, although i haven't seen it in a while, that has a really good techno/piano song in it that i can't seem to find again. once i heard the song i really liked it but can't come up with anything when i search for it. please help."
3,Buy this one!,The songs by Korn and Limp Bizkit are worth the money to buy the cd. That was why I bought it and I was not dissapointed.
5,Oh my god - here it is...,"Hang on. Hang on tooth and nail.Guns N` Roses ? Oh yeah.The rest ? Great too.Axl Rose (sole original member of GNR) is back.Oh My God is a soul-rattling tour-distorted-force take-no-prisoners all-holds-barred in-your-face we-are-back-jack-attack of a song so utterly COOL it leaves you gasping for more.Imagine classic Guns crossed with Kornish Bizkit, penetrated by nine sonically blarring Nine Inch Nails and a lightning bolt up the kazoo! In the hands of Sean Beavan. And Axl singing.This is a subtle move by Axl, an anti-commercial re-emergence, and hopefully it`ll get the respect it deserves.ps : Is Slash missed? Not really. I love him though. It`s like this...well, d`yall miss Keith on Jagger`s Kindred Spirit album? Yeah you did, but the album was the strongest Stones album since Some Girls all the same right?/Zaq"
3,Worth the Money,"This is a pretty good CD. It has all the hard groups/singers in one place, so if you just want a taste of where music is headed, this is a really good CD. I have never been a fan of Eminem, but his song is actually the best one here. Powerman 5000 is a new group to me, but they rocked it pretty hard. As for KoRn, the only song of theirs I have heard that I like is Blind. Do all of their songs sound like this one, or is it just me."
5,Great product,"This CD is the only CD that has Guns N' Roses' ""Oh My God"" on it. ""Oh My God"" is a great song."
4,Nice Gems on the Soundtrack,"If you collect music as I do and like rare finds, this soundtracks is for you. You will get some hit tracks that were played on the FM charts such as Everlast - So Long, Creed - Wrong Way and Powerman 5000 - Nobody's Real but I thought the tracks by Professional Murder Music - Slow and Guns N' Roses - Off My God were excellent rare finds."
4,Oh My God this was a tight album,"Eminem- has the best track on here Guns N' Roses- Kind of my favorite band of all time so i'm biased Korn- Tight track Limp Bizkit- Really tight track Everlast- The Best i've heard from him Creed- Pretty Good track Prodigy-Not a fan, but it's still pretty goodWhat're you waiting for, buy it now"
1,Terrible,"I got this because I thought there was going to be some good hard metal on it. It turns out the whole thing is soft. The only good song is Limp Bizkit's. Rob Zombie's is okay. Leave this CD on the shelf. If the movie is as bad as the soundtrack, I don't think I'll see it."
3,what's with the rap?,"Ok there were some good songs in here. But this is not a rap-type movie. These soundtrack-makers really need to get their act together, when they plan soundtracks. I like Korn, Powerman 5000, Zombie, and Creed's tracks. And I'm already a fan of Professional Murder Music, even though Iv'e never heard of them before. I can't stand Limp Bizkit, or Eminem. The bottom line is they should have used more techno or industrial music, and left out the rap. I'm talking about artists like Manson, Cubanate, Electric Hellfire Club, Source Direct, Static X, or Ministry. Those artists fit the movie alot better than Limp Bizkit or Eminem. This soundtrack just doesn't match the movie."
3,no sonic youth what have you done?,"i have little oppion on the tracks to this cd, but i wonder what is sonic youth doing on this soundtrack? They are supost to be underground indie music, how did they end up with limp bizkit? oh well i'll recover"
3,Al que le gusta le sabe,Si a usted le gusta alguno de estos grupos pues le debe de gustar el CD. (personalmente no es una tipica cancion de Gn'R mucho teclado y esas vainas)
1,the cd is fat and limpbizkit rocks,limpbizkit some body better stop this bet before i get out of hand when ur new cd comes out the first day im buying it
5,Kick @SS!,"I bought this CD mainly because of Korn, Limp Bizkit and Eminem. Korn's song is kick @ss, limps is ok, way to soft, and no guitarists, and Eminem is also kick @ss. Powerman5000 is already on my cd. It could bebetter but still 5 stars"
5,Great Compilation of Bands!,"For the most part, soundtracks are a huge rip-off. They're fuled by one or two good songs by big-name artists, and the rest of the songs are from groups you've never heard of. This is definitely not the case with the End of Days soundtrack. It offers up great songs from some of the biggest names in rock today. The songs by Korn, Professional Murder Music, Creed, Rob Zombie, Powerman 5000 and Eminem are all great. However, it is ""So Long"" by Everlast that stands out above all the others. The lyrics on this track are phenomenal. The only weak spots are the Limp Bizkit and Guns N' Roses songs. They certainly aren't on par with other songs by these great groups. However, the rest of the album more than makes up for these two marginal tracks. Definitely a must-have for all rock fans!"
5,It's supreme,"Before I heard this CD, I thought that just Everlast's and KoRn's songs are really good, but now I am very pleased about this CD. Unfortunately it's not available in Germany so I had to buy it [on the internet].btw: [....]"
5,One of the best soundtracks out there,"This soundtrack is really amazing. It doesn't have a single weak song. So one can listen to this album over and over again.It starts my ""Camel Song"" by KoRn, arguably one of the best songs they ever did. The next song is ""So Long"" by Everlast, again one of the best songs he ever did. ""Slow"" by Professional Murder Music is cool, too. Limp Bizkit's ""Crushed"" is untypically slow, but despite great. And that's how it goes on. You'll enjoy song after song. ""Bad Influence"" by Eminem, doesn't quite match the album's line-up, since it's rap. But the beats are rather heavy. Personally I think, Eminem has done better sons than this, but still you won't be disappointed.The CD end slower and more quiet than it has started. ""I Wish I Had"" by Stroke, ""Sugar Kane"" by Sonic Youth and Creed's ""Wrong Way"" make this soundtrack perfect. ""End Of Days"" is a great compilation of rock and metal songs. A must-have!"
3,Coney Island.,Nice but not what I asked for. I received the 1938 photo and I wanted the 1945 one. Disappointing but still lovely and funny.
3,for diehard MJ fans only,"unfortunatly for MJ, the nineties have not been good for michael, and michael hasn't really lived up to his promises of being the King of POP as of late. and this ""album"" is eternal proof of this. there is absolutley nothing innovative or fresh on this collection, and the only strong (not as weak as the rest of the album) tracks are Ghosts, Morphine, and Earth Song-Hani's Mix, the rest is tired and certainly not worthy of Micheal's discography. i would reccomend this collection to die hard MJ fans only."
3,Very angry album,"Michael isn't a smooth singer anymore.Starting around the ""Victory"" ""Bad"" and ""Dangerous"" albums,he stopped singing in his trademark tenor voice and actually started screaming.Plus,he changed his music style.""Off the wall""was pure disco and soul.""Thriller"" involved rock,soul,R/B,and about every good music genre.But around the ""Bad"" time period,he quit singing smooth ballads and started shouting the lyrics. Sometimes I feel like he is angry and screaming at me!He needs to stop remixing his old songs,improve his singing,and leave the hard rock stuff alone. Michael has lost his trademark Superstardom.This album shows just how much Michael has changed since the mid-eighties musically."
2,I only liked one Song,"I purchased this CD because it had the song Ghosts that I wanted to hear. I assumed that it would be a good CD since I really do enjoy Michael Jackson's music. However, it was very disapointing. The only song that I really liked is ""Ghosts."" Is it scary is nice but the rest of the songs, which were remixes of previous songs, were not my bag."
1,why the hell did he make this album,"couldn't he just have waited a while let's say like july 1999. The songs that are truly his are great no doubt, but the mixes, they might not be terrible but they aren't great either. And why do his singles always have those stupid remixes anyway. You buy a single and find a hundred other remixes which all are the same except from one computerized percussion somewhere in the background. May god save you if your a fan of this guy, you feel obliged to buy everything but what do you get, only remixes. Like with the 5 different existing versions of stranger in moscow. five times the same song and 30 remixes. now wow, that's just what i wanted, NOT!!!!! You got the same deal with all those r&b singles, always remixes and remixes, f*%$#k those mixes, thank god for the creativity of the so called rock and alternative music, at least they throw some real b-sides on their singles."
5,Hauntingly Beautiful Wonderfully Created,"Being a fan for many years, I have had the chance to listen to Michael evolve into the creative artist that he has become today. I know that the media bashes him on just about everything except breathing, but I think that he needs a break. The songs 'Morphine, & Is it Scary,' show that Michael was admitting to caring for people who have faced the challenges and hurdles that he has? I think that this album is wonderfully creative and I look forward to buying any more that he produces. Many people have forgotten about the inner essence that makes up a person and Michael has the ability to give that to us in his songs. Keepin' the Faith!"
3,Botdf is not mj material,"In my opinion, this isn't his best album. Placing 5 new songs with remixes from HIStory wasn't really good. The new tracks are cool but I don't like the album through the rest of the way. But hopefully the next one will be better."
3,average could have been better,the five songs have ther moments.morphine was the cut.it alone gives this album it's stars.it has genius all over it.superfly sister is okay very cameo influenced. blood on the dancefloor sounds dated.but ghost and is this scary prove my point that if this had been a straight album it would have been better.the remixes are so so.
2,Michael is good but that...,"The new songs are really good, nice and perfect. They are various, have new sound and they are in the typical brilliant Michael Jackson stil. If they made the whole album I would give it 5 stars. But I am sorry. The remixes are so bad. I's a kind of the badest techno I have ever listned to. Only boom, boom, boom. Mother, please say, that Michael hasn't allowed them to sell this remixes. Please Michael, I am waiting for a better album soon!"
4,"New songs are great, remixes are okay","This is a very good album mainly due to the 5 new songs. The title song is such a superb dance number, stylish, groovy and with awesome beats. Don't know why he didn't put it in History album. Morphine is a great song, very creative, and sadly its tells MJ's own story as it he goes to sing ""demerol, demerol, oh God he's taking demerol"". Ghosts is very catchy, and MJ's has shown some of his best dance moves in its video. Is It Scary is a true gem. MJ's vocals are at their best and lyrics tell how much pain he was in due to media and ignorance of people. That time people didn't care but now if you listen it it brings tears to eyes realizing how much trouble MJ was in and no one cared. It is a haunting song. Superfly Sister is catchy though it is my least favorite among the five. From the remixes for me the best are History and Earth Song, the rest are okay."
4,Spill the blood spill the blood spill the blood,"Yup michaels first attempts at doing a remix album! and it is already the best selling remix album of all time? The 5 new songs, cuts from the history album are phenomenal and then there are the remixes I must admit the only good remix on this album is the last track ""History"" the rest are cheap and very dated club mixes not my style! but what makes the C.D are tracks like the grungy morphine and the hip and groovy Superfly sister!Buy this C.D for the 5 new songs and if your into the club schene use the remixes thats my advice!"
3,With love for Michael...,"I agree with some reviews on this page. This album doesn't come from his roots(but pain) and is not going anywhere. I am really big fan of his for 12 years and I think after ""Bad"" Michael seems far distance away from anyone's understanding. I am really sad. I want to hear him singing happy song like gospel which is supposed to be his origin. I think he lost understanding of what music really is. Music is FUN, Music is JOY, Music is CRY from heart... I can't picture him smiling or laughing when he's in studio. I don't care what color Mike is, what his children look like, or his religious concern. I JUST want...I don't know what to say.I heard his next album is going to be his final one. OK, Mike, sing away whatever you want to and HAVE A FUN to make music. I WILL listen. You are natural born Super Star."
3,Mixed feelings about this one.,The thing that has me wondering about this release is that why out of 13 songs did he only include 5 new songs and 8 remakes from his previous album?? He was better off not releasing this one until he came up an entire new slate of songs. It's almost as if he put only half the effort into this album. Well I'll expect a little more out of Michael next time.
3,its good but not micheal at his best,this is a good album don't get me wrong but weres the feeling all i here is screaming micheal dosn't sing anymore morphine superflysister to me are noise compared to rockwithyou ladyinmylife man in the mirror remeberthetimeor songs he puts feeling into i agree he needs to go back to his Black roots.
3,not bad,"I think MICHEAL JACKSON is the best songer of the world ,but this albom is not in the level that we use to listen from micheal jackson so i hope to listen more best from micheal in the future ."
3,Not Michael's best work!,"This album just does not measure up because of the remixes and the songs Morphine and Superfly Sister. Blood on the dance floor was an awesome song with a catchy beat. Morphine was just not a good style for Michael Jackson to use it just is not a style that I think works for him. Superfly Sister needs to go it seems to me Michael is trying some new styles I just hope he knows that the styles for Morphine and Superfly Sister are not going to help him with his future work. Ghosts and Is it Scary are awesome songs telling the press off for the false rumors and just straight up lies about him. This album is good to buy for Michael's devoted fans. I hope that Michael's new album measure's up to Dangerous or the HIStory album. I will buy it because I am a devoted fan and have loved him since I was 3, but I still want him to give me the best in entertainment in music. I know he can if he puts his heart in to it like he has on all of his past albums."
3,OK For An Album Not Meant To Be Released,"Although MJ Did'nt Want This Album To Be Released. I'm Glad It Was. The Songs Blood On The Dance Floor, Ghosts, And Is It Scary Are Some Of MJ's Best. Superfly Sister And Morphine Are (To Me) Filler Tracks. The Remixes Of HIStory And Earth Song Are Great (Too Bad I Can't Say The Same For The Other Ones). All Together, It's An OK Album.Chart PeaksBlood On The Dance Floor (Album) #23 US #1 UKBlood On The Dance Floor (Song) #42 US #1 UKHIStory (RMX) #5 UKGhosts #5 UKIs It Scary? #1 Austria"
3,Split Decision!,"Why you should get this CD:The remixes are nice! Todd Terry gives a disco-injection to ""Stranger in Moscow,"" David Morales goes tribal in ""This Time Around,"" and Hani gives life and energy in the house-remixed ""Earth Song."" Farley and Heller, known for their disco-flavored jams, provide a mid-tempo groove to ""Money.""Why you may want to avoid this CD:The new material is among Jackson's very worst. The title track sounds like a reject from the ""Dangerous"" recording sessions; ""Superfly Sister"" sounds hilariously dated and lifeless, and ""Is it Scary"" is a shockingly dull mid-tempo number from Jam and Lewis. ""Morphine"" could be the worst offender, as Jackson tries to be Trent Reznor. Not working.Overall, this record is okay for Jackson completists, but should be avoided by casual listeners."
5,Stunning album that was seriously underrated.,"A cracking album that shot straight to No 1 in the UK and bursts with Michael's anger and vitriol. His voice is just amazing. Check out Ghosts/Is it Scary, This Time Around and the remixed Scream and see what I mean. Powerful stuff that's also incredibly energising. While I was formerly not a big fan of dance music the reworked tracks are treated in such a brilliant way that I am coverted.Pulsating. Recommended."
4,Good,"One of the greatest things about Michael Jackson is his versatility. Also I think his fame is a symptom of the strangeness that surrounds him. He's not going to be a ""normal"" person by the standards by which we measure others. And I think the fault of most people is that they try to look at him as being someone who should be logically accessible as well in our concepts of our own worlds. I really liked this cd and recommend this highly for the beats."
2,The Thing of Pop,Only for fans of HIStory album. Remix removes a lot from already disappointing album.
2,The REAL reason for this album was.....,"to overcome all of the bad publicity from his child sex abuse scandal. That situation created so much negative publicity for him that he had to marry Elvis Presley's daughter just to get the news media to stop talking about the sex scandal. No album he released at that time was going to have much commercial success.I am a big fan of Michael's music, but this is a throw-away piece and it was intended as such. Look at the obvious amount of effort that he has put into all of his other albums, both before and after this one.This album was damage control, plain and simple. But I still liked a couple of the tunes."
5,Awesome dance music!,"Nearly 2 years after the release of HISTORY BOOK I,PAST PRESENT AND FUTURE,BLOOD ON THE DANCE FLOOR was released with re-use of 8 original HISTORY tracks. Those tracks would appear on this album in dance mix form. SCREAM is a duet between the King Of Pop and his sister Janet Jackson. I like the sound of HISTORY,STRANGER IN MOSCOW and 2 BAD. THIS TIME AROUND,YOU ARE NOT ALONE,EARTH SONG and MONEY are very cool. The title track tells about a murderess named Susie. MORPHINE really rocks. IS IT SCARY? and GHOSTS are ideal for Halloween. SUPERFLY SISTER is pretty cool also."
5,Blood is and always will be on the Dance Floor,"This a great album! It has great songs and great remixes from another one of his greatest albums, HIStory. It has 5 great new songs and five fantastic remixes. But the best thing about this it went Gold and Platinum. Plus it has great pictures, in Invincible Michael's pictures didn't ammuse me. But I love Blood on the Dance Floor!"
3,New songs are good but remixes are boring,"This isn't really a true Michael Jackson album, since more than half the songs on the album are remixes from HIStory. The five new songs that are included are incredible, though. Morphine and Is It Scary are particularly stunning. I never listen to the remixes but I constantly listen to the five new ones. Enjoy!"
5,Whoo hoo for the baby born bouncy seat,I love baby born and the bouncy seat is the perfect accessiorie because when its time for a bottle feeding its nice because you don't have to craddle baby born and at the same time squeeze the bottle. Also it can be taken off the frame for a soft craddle and to be removed and HAND WASHED!!!!!!!!!!!!!So this is an excellent accesory for your baby born doll!!!!
5,Bouncy Seat a big bonus,"This seat has added lots of enjoyment to my two girls (ages 3 and 5) use of all of their dolls. I bought it for the chou chou, but find that the Corrolle dolls like it too. It helps them sit up for doctor checkups or when ""mommy"" has her hands full with more than one doll, and the cloth part detaches and acts like a light weight carrier (perfect for my 3 year old). The only problem is that the buckles are a little tricky for my little one, she can't operate them, but her big sister can so it works."
4,"Excellent, comprehensive on the part of subject dealt with.","The book is very comprehensive on the specific part of the subject discussed: American, Ashkenazi laws and customs. However, it doesn't deal with the laws and customs elsewhere (e.g., Israel) and ignores Sephardi Jewish customs. Highly recommended if you only want to know about the Ashkenazi Jewish laws and customs in North America."
5,Moving and thoughtful,"My father had just died and I was given this book by his synagogue. As I spent the week sitting shivah with my family I read through it. It was comforting, informative and very very helpful. I think it would be helpful not only to Jewish mourners but to anyone who has lost a loved one."
4,comprehensive orthodox view,"This book is tremendously informative about every possible question you could have about the Jewish laws and customs about death and mourning. It is well written and it's easy to look up questions you have. It's nicely broken down in chronological order from the end of life until the yearly yahrzeit observance.It is, however, from the modern orthodox perspective. As a recent mourner, it made me feel guilty that my reform family was not observing all the minute details of mourning that occur. It's strength, tho, is that you know all the details and can observe what you can. And you now know what the ideal might be.The paradox of course is that one is not likely to purchase or read it until some of the stages of mourning have passed. But it is comforting to read about the stages and their meaning even if they have passed. Plus it leaves you well informed should a death occur in the future, a likelihood for all of us mortals."
4,Great Fun For The Little Britain Fan!!,My husband and I are fans of the Little Britain show and were very happy that they came out with a PC game of it. The characters are as much fun as they are in the series. It's a very entertaining game to play.
4,Best I have found so far,"I have a Bearded Collie who requires frequent grooming. I have tried a number of detanglers and this is the best I have found. It is not perfect and I am open to other products, but this is the best so far."
2,If You Can See The Print,It is a wonderful book with lots of great side stories. It also has the calendar of Church readings so you can follow along with the liturgical year. My only complaint is the small size of the print. I must wear my glasses to read it and even then it is difficult.
4,"Finally, an adequate devotional bible for Catholics","As a Catholic, I've found that up to now, our devotional Bibles (which are usually hard to find!) have been very thin on inspirational articles, application notes and clear discussions of the scriptural basis of many of our traditions. This Bible contains profiles of women in the Bible, suggestions on how to use them as prayer partners, articles on the biblical basis of Catholic practices, a lectionary and a subject index. The NRSV translation is a great choice. It's clear, features inclusive language where appropriate without detracting from the historical feel of the text. Using it will give Catholics (and especially Catholic women) a great appreciation for their religion and will deepen their spirituality. I gave it 4 stars because I would have wanted a more extensive index (I think all Bibles should feature a concordance at the end), but this Bible is worth having and worth USING!"
5,If my house were on fire... this is coming with me!,"I LOVE this bible!!! I've had it for decades - bought it in my early 20's, and it has seen me through many phases of my life. The older I get, the more precious it has become. I have given it many times as a gift to special women in my life, and all have really cherished this bible, as I have. It's an great translation (NRSV), has excellent meditations (written by women), great intros to each of the books,a user friendly topical index, explanations of various Catholic faith traditions, and a lovely feature - praying with the women of the bible. This bible has brought me along in my Catholic faith in many profound ways. As I said, if my house were on fire ... this would come with me!"
2,Not what I expected,"I was disappointed in this Devotional Bible. In previous years I had read a one year devotional bible that my husband was given. We shared it. It was not ""Catholic"" persay, however the way it was organized was very nice. Each day it offered an old testament reading, then a new testament reading and lastly a psalms. You got a little bit of all of it each day. It was clear as to where you stopped and began each day. In the above women's devotional bible... it just starts from the beginning and randomly sticks in ""thoughts of the day"". I found myself wondereing where exactly I was supposed to stop reading and begin for the next day. I didn't care for how it was set up. Other than the cover being pretty on this women's bible... that's all I liked about it. That's just my opinion... take it or leave it. Blessings! Shellie M."
3,"Don't Look Back, We're Not Going That Way","This book is a show of triumph over adversity and also how difficult it can be to deal with new found success while still dealing with the deomons of the past. It is an inspiration to all. However, I could have done with knowing a lot less about Ms. Wallace's sex life and sexual desires. I think perhaps she was advised to include this in order to sell the book. It would have been better without it."
3,Starter Guitar,For the price I paid this is a pretty good guitar for my 7 year old to start with. Nice finish for a young girl also.
3,Good read,"This book is enjoyable to read. The first time I read it, I couldn't get through it for some reason, it just didn't hold my attention, that's why I gave it 3 stars. The second time I picked it up to give it another try, I found it very fitting for my life at the time.It covers all the everyday stresses of motherhood. Some people try to poo-poo stay-at-home moms like they have the good life, but this book shows how even moms have their set of stresses and issues, just like any other job.It's written in an engaging, humorous style, which keeps it entertaing while it's also informative. It'd be a good one for husbands to read, if you can get them to!"
3,"Yes, I think so","I used to hear my mother complain about her motherhood stress to us, her sons. So that got me into thinking about it. Now, it is pretty similar to what is in this book, but I thought it was an obvious thing. Maybe it is just me, while the other men are oblivious to this fact? All in all, this book offers some advice on coping with this stress and the advice is generally sensible, however it is pretty standard advice. This book is ok but nothing more than the average self-help book."
2,Skipped Parts,"I was so very disappointed in Skipped Parts. After preordering and waiting so long for it, the movie is not at all what I was hoping for. The sexual exploration between the teenagers could have been handled much differently without some of the crude comments. What I thought was going to be a very good movie with an interesting storyline, has turned out to be a crude and unappealing story."
2,A Sizeable Disappointment,"Like most people who made the effort to see this movie, I read Tim Sandlin's book and thoroughly enjoyed it.Unfortunately for this movie, Sandlin is a far better novelist than screenwriter.The film is disjointed, awkward, and hard to follow. It quickly hops from one important moment of the book to another, allowing almost no time to understand the characters and their motivations or appreciate the bizarre circumstances of the story.The casting isn't bad-- a prepubescent Mischa Barton was a fine choice (a hysterical one for fans of the O.C.), and Jennifer Jason Leigh is also respectable, although she doesn't fit her character's physical description-- but that doesn't nearly make up for the film's jumpy direction and half-baked plot.In sum, this is a dissatisfying and substandard film. Undoubtedly, the subject matter is better suited for a novel, and Sandlin's humor and talents are better utilized there.Read his books. Avoid this movie."
1,Skipped Parts,"Do yourself a favor and skip this movie!. As some one who grew up in Wyoming in the sixties I was terribly offended by this movie. I haven't read the book this movie was based on but I hope it was more on target than this movie... Someone needs to inform Hollywood that Wyoming is closer to Canada than Georgia..people from Wyoming don't talk with a southern accent. If I hear Brad Renfro say Y'all one more time..... Jennifer Jason Leigh recieved critical acclaim for playing a drunk in the movie ""Georgia"" so it seems she is just going to keep playing the same role over and over again. Please someone make her stop. She is way past the age where she can play a twenty something unwed mother.She is much better at playing the forty something washed up actress in ""The Anniversary Party"". Frankly this movie just made me sad, sad that movies like this get made, and sad that I wasted two hours of my life."
1,Travesty,"An accessible story with all the elements of a Great American Novel was somehow transformed into a perverse, worst of the worst ABC Afterschool Specials. If you had not read the book, you would be unable to follow what was happening. Some of the worst directing and editing I have seen in a long time. The original Evil Dead, with all its flaws, is a better put together film than this one. This movie is flat-out painful to watch. You get no justifications whatsoever as to why the characters behave as they do. It all seems so random. Read the book. If you see this movie in a rental store, just move along, please, nothing to see here."
4,Good comedy with sometimes shallow characterizations,"The ""Skipped Parts"" are, as you might expect, the little details of sex that are omitted from most stories. Two fourteen-year-olds decide to work out the details themselves, with a little advice from the boy's licentious Mother and a lot of free time together. The film begins with the Mother's rich politician Father exiling her and her illegitimate teenage son from their North Carolina home to Wyoming so they won't be an embarrassment during his political campaign. The story really belongs to the Mother and her new Indian boyfriend. She was about her son's age when she found herself pregnant and dealing with his concerns helps her sort out her own life. It is a lighthearted look at moral bigotry, responsibility, and mixed up relationships. This is a generally delightful, tasteful, and witty comedy compromised by sometimes shallow characterizations and blessed with occasional insights."
4,Amen!,"Good ""ole school"" Winans...these brothers really know how to get you into praising the Lord and focusing on the goodness of God!"
5,Affordable Home Theater,"For about $1000-$1200, The Epson Movemate 25 allows you to create your own home theater. I've used mine for about 2 years now, projecting onto my wall to create a 10' screen. A couple times we moved the furniture and had ourselves an 18' (diagonal) screen-great for watching King Kong. The image is sharp and clear and the sound is more than adequate for watching movies from our couch. You won't have ""surround-sound"" but the accompanying sub-woofer is enought to give a little extra ""punch"" especially during battle scenes, etc. Combined with Netflix its a lot cheaper than movie theaters. Once you try it, you'll never again waste your time watching a movie on a TV set."
5,Enlightening Martial Arts Book,"The Secrets of Shotokan Karate is well-written. The photos, all in black and white are easy to understand, as are the explanations of the fighting techniques. This book is suitable for martial artists at all levels."
4,:) THIS IS GREAT,"I heard this for the first time in a friends car on the way to lunch. I couldn't believe my ears..Wyclef is great. Im not a big fan of rap but Wyclef has his own sounds he doesnt make me cringe like puffy..and Im so glad. His songs were stuck in my head all day and they still are, weeks later i'm still hearing 'gone till november' and 'what say what'. I cant wait to buy it."
1,"A misguided, garbled, waste of money.",I bought this cd after hearing two songs- gone till november and stayin alive. These turned out to be the only decent tracks on the album- and they're not even that good. The rest of the cd is a bunch of weak songs strung together with stupid off tracks which sound as if they were accidentally recorded during a midday blunt session. My advice- forget Wyclef- but check out Lauryn Hill.
5,great cd,i`m not gonna write anything else except great cd! well hey! look thats all i wrote! i mean lol i`1m writting this but you dopn`t really care!
4,A worthwhile purchase,"In his solo debut, Wyclef has established himself as a real force to reckoned with in the hip-hop world. While some of the lyrics in a few tracks are lacking, overall Wyclef is an entertaining story-teller, who has created a thought provoking artistically masterful album. The tracks flow together nicely, and the production is absolutely amazing. Something here for traditional hip-hop fans as well as new comers. Check out the track featuring one of the Neville brothers."
5,a good piece of work,"this cd has it all. a little splash of rap, mixed with a whole lot of soul and good old rock and roll. there's nothing better than sitting down and listening to wyclef and others roll out smooth meaningful lyrics with awesome beats. this cd is great! make sure to check out the song gunpowder if you're a bob marley fan...you won't believe how alike they sound. get this cd today!!"
4,nice piece of work,"I was a fan of the fugees in about 1996 so when this album came out 1997 I remember all the promotion for it and wyclef promoting it all over the place. I couldn't into his music like with the fugees and at that time I didn't appreciate the acoustic guitar styles he was doing like I do now. Now when I look back on the state of hip hop of 1997 wyclef was creative and innovative doing his own thing and for that he deserves his props. I remember him doing remixes for destiny's child and michael jackson around this time as well, wyclef's music was on fire! I guess if you liked fiona apple, jewel , tracy chapman and sarah mclaclan in 1997 you will most probably like this as well it has guitars with a fun urban twist to it. You can party to it and relax to it as well. This album was obviously geared towards audiences of all ages and all colours, and not for the teenyboppers only like many rappers seem to be doing now."
4,No Clowing Around,"While Wyclef is not as lyrically clever as Canibus or Big Pun, he does manage to convince me he is a true emcee. A one word description of this album could be versatility. Where as most artists make the mistake of ""making something for everyone"", Wyclef made this album for himself, which keeps the theme of the album nicely focused. The appearances of John Forte, Lauryn Hill and Pras (probably the weakest, lyrically, in the group) are a bonus. Pick it up today."
2,"NO, NO, NO...maybe next time Wyclef!","I fail to see his rapping talents! Yes he can play the guitar, but his rappin' skillz are waaayy down! Thank goodness he had the common sense to put the strongest rapper of the group-Lauryn, on the CD, 'cause who knows what it would've turned out like!!"
5,it really works!,"This product really does work. I have tried EVERYTHING on the market for blackheads, and i mean everything. then i saw this in Ulta one day and decided to try it. it is worth it.YOu have to apply it to a clean face, otherwise, it won't work. a thin layer smoothed over your skin will dry in a minute or two. then you literally roll out your blackheads, which is kinda gross but kinda addicting. it stings for a moment, but that's fine. also, it left my skin red (for obvious reasons - its killing bacteria and all that gunk) for an hour or so, so use it at night (like the directions tell you to)give it a try!"
5,Solution to the problems with Disc#1,"Should you experience any problem with the first disc (like I did), contact Magnolia directly at dvd@magpictures.com and they will send you out a replacement for it.Hope this helps anyone who received a bad copy..."
1,Doesn't work,"Buy this DVD if you feel like getting a product that doesn't work. On a north american DVD player, anyway.Not impressed"
3,california map,"This map is ok if you need the lamination; however, it doesn't have as much detail as a regular Rand McNally map, so be forewarned. It's alright if you're not going anywhere tricky or improvising a lot on the fly."
4,satisfied customer,"a good camera for my needs. easy operation, nice features, & good value for the money. screen could be a little bigger, but not a real problem personally. the real enjoyment is printing out the pictures,and being quite satisfied with the performance of this camera."
1,"Bought this camera last week, returning it this week.","I took pics at my grandson's 3rd birthday party, every pic of him with the cake came out DARK! Many were blurry, takes too long in between shots to capture any spontaneous moments with a toddler - who doesn't like to stand there long enough waiting for my camera to get ready. I opted for this lower priced camera over a Canon. I'm returning it tomorrow, and going for the more expensive canon, and hoping I have better luck!DL"
4,"Good, I my last Kodak was better","I like the simplicity of this camera, and the easy share editing sofware it comes with. You can edit and send off for your digital pics in one easy step. then it allows you to place them in your online gallery to share with a click of the mouse. The camera has all the great features you love, including video, and modes for picutres suc as portrait, landscape, sports, etc. You can easily change flash modes, it is quick and easy to learn the features and use. I was using mine within 10 minutes of receipt! My only complaints: The batteries die kinda quick when you have the viewing screen on, and it sometimes gives me blurred pictures because it focuses on something that was in the foreground, instead of teh subject. this happens when I am taking pictures quickly wothout looking to see the focus brackets. other than that, a good buy!"
3,Good little camera...mostly...,"For a small, basic camera, this one works quite well. The biggest problem is that when the batteries are down to around 90% power (multimeter measured the two AA batteries connected in series at 2.71 volts when removed from the camera), the camera begins having difficulty turning on and staying on. With fresh batteries, the camera turned on fine. An AC adapter for this camera is available for purchase. This camera takes AA batteries, so this device is definitely a candidate for having multiple sets of NiMH rechargeables on hand to keep taking pictures."
4,great so far,"I bought this camera to replace a 3MP Kodak CX series when I thought I had lost it. My 3MP took great pics and I never had any problems with it and I didn't want to have to learn to use a different brands software.The Kodak easyshare software didn't impress me much when I bought the first camera but they have made some improvements and the updated version is much better. The Kodak gallery is a nice option that allows you to share pics without sending large email files.I haven't used the C533 a lot since I bought it but the pics I've taken have come out great. But just like the other reviews state, slow shutter speed at low light and it does like batteries. However, if you spend the extra money for the Lithium batteries you'll get much improved battery life.All in all a great value and a perfect camera for a point and shoot person."
4,Remarkably Functional,"I brought this camera to the summit of Mt. Kilimanjaro (19,200 ft) in sub-freezing tempertures. It took picutures beautifully and survived the difficult journey intact. Buy lithium batteries (per manufacturers recommendations) and you don't have to replace them as often."
3,Great camera for the price,"The camera takes great pictures, BUT you do need additional memory to be able to take more than 10 picures. It should have come with regcharageable batteries as battery life may be an issue. Other than those two issues, I am very pleased with the operation of the camera and the picture results."
4,Great Camera.,"Of course, it had to be Kodak. No matter what people say, i have always and will always use a kodak digital camera, I've found this camera to be a real warrior, last one I had lasted about 4 year and this one looks even better, Photo cuality its very good and colors are great, no excesive blue or red in your pics, Night photo taking its excelent in close shots.4 stars beacuse its really a batterie eater, but its nothing a 25$ batterie charger can`t solve.Sorry for grammar mistakes but english is not my natal lenguaje."
1,Died immediately after warranty expiration...of course,"The camera came with a poor excuse for a rechargeable battery pack. A full charge would handle shooting no more than a dozen to maybe a dozen and a half pictures. It didn't take me long to start using Duracells.Shortly after I'd had the camera a year, and of course shortly after it went out of warranty, it quit working. It soured me enough that it will NOT be replaced with a Kodak anything."
5,Buy This Great Camera !!! Get A Memory Card And Rechargeable Batteries !!!!,I got this camera for less than 100 dollars. I love it. I hardly ever used it until I went to FL over the 2007 Christmas Holday. I went to Disneyworld and this camera fulfilled my expectations and more. I took still pictures and video with it. Mind you I bought a Memory card as without one you cant hold many picutures or videos. I never ran out of memory and the pics and videos were great !!! The only negative thing I have to say is the batteries sure go fast. I am thankful now that I had invested in an Energizer battery charger with rechargable batteries. I used the rechargeable batteries taking pictures in NYC and they lasted much longer than the regular batteries!! Buy this camera and you wont be sorry!!!!!
2,Worked great during the time it worked,"I purchased this camera in January 2007 for a trip to Australia. This is the first digital camera I've owned, and I wanted something very easy to use. It worked perfectly, took great pictures in all situations; groups, portraits, night shots, landscapes, indoor or outdoor. I don't take a lot of photos, but wanted good pictures of my vacation, and this camera performed well, was incredibly easy to use. I purchased rechargeable batteries and they lasted very well. I loved this camera up until a week ago when I pulled it out to take some family photos, and the LCD was a black blank. Everything else worked, menu, flash, photo review, lens, etc, but no image on screen, and no image if photo was taken. Contacted Kodak and since I can not find my receipt it will cost approximately $80 to repair. I have since heard this is a relatively common problem with these cameras as they approach one year-when they go out of warranty. I'm buying a different brand as a replacement"
3,"Basic cheap digital camera, but with all functions","Only I miss on this camera is the image stabilization, the rest, I can do everything with this camera, of course, with the basic functionality, but still everything"
1,messed up,It came in a timely fashion but when i got it out to use it something inside is broken and rattles in there. the share button does not work so i have to manually put them all the computer mmyself.
2,unreliable,"I bought one of these C533's to take to Africa 3 years ago. During my stay it stopped functioning and I couldn't get it replaced until I got back and then had to wait nearly a month for the replacement. Fortunately I was able to save the photos, its the camera's ability to focus and read an image that is unstable. Last week I was visiting my son in San Francisco and we went to a Giants/Dodgers game and darn if the same thing didn't happen again. I am not abusive to my technology, I try to keep it clean and safe from bumps and moisture.I would not recommend this product. It is easy to use until it unpredictably won't work. There is an Australian joke that goesQ: What do you call a boomerang that won't come back?A: A stickI just bought a Canon A470 for $110 that will do everything the C533 will do for significantly less. hopefully it is more reliable"
5,many photo's,a good book that covers mustang up to 1989 highly detailed photo's well written for enthusiast and younger also
2,"Erm, is it supposed to be so.... ICKY?!","I got this in Rich Ginger or whattever, because that's the color I use- just a different brand. And it just clumps and as soon as you put something over it to add a little shine it goes poof! Buh-bye, no more lip liner. It's a complete waste!"
5,great jazz--Indian fusion,"Great stuff!-- Ramesh Shotham (drums, percussion, vocals), Sandhya Sanjana (vocals), Zoltan Lantos (violin), Christian Zürner (bass), Mike Herting (piano)"
5,Biggest Fan,"This is my second or maybe third purchase of this CD. I play it to death! It's a great CD to have ontrips because you find yourself singing to almost every song. I'm a long time fan of Mr. Loggins, see himevery year and suggest people do if they have the opportunity. I think you'd be surprised if you haven't seen him and are a baby boomer!!Everyone knows his music whether you know you know it or not!Enjoy,"
5,kkenny loggins,II still knew almost all the songs by heart. The songs took me back to my teenage years. Worth buying.
2,Great songs but poor SACD,"What an amazing collection of songs. This makes it even more disappointing that the mastering is so harsh and ""redbook CD"" sounding. I'm playing only DVD-A's and SACD's now and loving it but although this collection is stereo and not multi channel, it's still a far too harsh and unmusical sounding presentation."
3,I agree with Fletch,"I had high hopes for this SACD as I enjoy a lot of his songs. That said, I found it was half and half. Some songs sound pretty good (Heart to Heart) but others sound somewhat bright and sharp. Some sound like some of the midrange is missing or mastered low.Overall, don't expect too much from this Stereo SACD. That said, it's not horrible, but not that great either. I'd give it a C+ on sound quality overall and an A for content."
5,A great collection of hits,"This is an album that is packed with great songs. I bought this album mainly for ""For the first time"" which I just love. I knew ""Footloose"", but thought that those two songs were all that I knew on this album. But as I listened, I was like ""Wow, I know that song"", and ""I didn't know that was a Loggins song"". I was so pleasantly suprised that I knew nearly all of the songs without even realizing who they were by. And I must say that this is one of my favourite albums, each song is great, and runs the gamut from dance to ballads. The liner notes contain pictures of the albums that each song comes from, plus most songs have a paragraph about it, written by Kenny."
5,GREAT SONGS,This the most complete collection of Kenny Loggins if you enjoy his music you will love this CD BUT IT TODAY
4,Good compilation,"Loggins' G.H. I bought had a good overall selection of songs. I saw him live a couple of summers ago and vocally he's spot on. Not bad for a guy in his 60's. His band also has a tight sound. As far as this compilation goes, it'd be nice to have included some Loggins & Messina music but maybe there are copyright restrictions, etc., preventing him from including those tunes on this record."
4,A suprising number of hits.,"I got this expecting to know just the big soundtrack songs, and ended up knowing almost the whole thing. Also, I was amazed at how well I knew them, and liked them. Besides the hits from ""Top Gun"", ""Footloose"", and ""Caddyshack"", I found twice as many songs that were just as good. Plus, excellent help from ""Michael McDonald"", ""Stevie Nicks"", and ""Steve Perry"". This almost plays through like a ""Best of the 80's"" cd, as much as it does a ""Kenny Loggins"" collection. The whole disc was pretty much a case of ""Oh, that's Kenny Loggins""? Anyway, if you're a fan of anything mentioned above, get ""Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow""."
5,Kenny Loggins greatest hits are great,My wife is a BIG fan of Kenny Loggins and she was very happy to receive the DVD as a gift. I highly recommend it to others who appreciate Loggins music. It's full of hits.
5,Nice scraper,I needed this to remove glue squeeze-out from a table top glue-up I was doing. It worked very well; I'm sure it will work on other projects also.
3,fine book for practicing but,"This is one of the nice book for practicing,but it doesn't really do much on the speakingor the writing section. It just have the whole listof writing questions and samples so I didn't knowhow to prepare. For reading and listening section,it has CD and gives you some practice tests, which I liked.It has all the answers and explanations, but the explanationpart was kind of repeating the answer, so it didn't help methat much.I think this is just good book foranother book to prepare for Toefl, though."
2,It is not helpful to prepare the Toefl test.,"I bought this book. It shows only outline. It is really guide book.I bought other book and compared.If you, who are using english as a second language, want to take the test, I'll recomend that you'll have to buy other books."
2,"It is good, but...","The book has been prepared good but the computer's adaptivity is very poor. The CD of the book should be prepared in the context of CDROM. There isnt any format of the examination in the book, no pictures in the listening section and no reading format.... On the other hand, the book has not any full practise test like examination. It is good but not adequate."
4,Good Book,"The book is good for the preparation.But it comes with audioCD.I wud have rated 5 if this book has a CD-ROM instead of audioCD.The main problem is there are no real Practice tests.But every thing is good.I have ordered this book through ECAMPUS book store.But i didnt receive any audioCD with this.They didnt mention it at the time of ordering that..there is no audioCD with this book.I wud have bought a new book with that same price.When i mailed them about this,they never replied me back.Thats cheating.So becareful while ordering books from ECAMPUS book store."
4,good book,this is a good book for practicing ibt test. Finish this book before you taking the test. It is useful.
2,not on me expected,"realy , not very good , and maybe give you a glance , but not good to preper for the test"
2,Book Purchase Review,The book I purchased was received on time and in an excellent condition. I would not hesitate to purchase a book from Amazon.com in the near future. They will not disappoint you.
3,required book,"not very user friendly for use while engaged in patient care. Better as a reference book, would not plan on carrying this in my kit."
5,Good Reference addition,"Finally, a book full of useful and 'real' life examples. This book provides clear usage of the many verbs listed using an assortment of tenses and conjugations. Don't expect this book to teach you how to conjugate verbs like the `501 verbs' book but, it will show you how to use those 501 verbs under a variety of contexts.I wouldn't recommend this book to a novice since the book seems to assume that you have knowledge of most of the tenses. In fact, I'd probably find the book a little confusing/frustrating if I were at the ""Italian 101"" level. But for intermediate students, especially those whom are writing essays, I think the book is a good addition to their Italian library references."
3,Best as a supplement only,"For most beginners and intermediate students, I would say stick with 501 Italian Verbs--it is absolutely indispensable as a reference as you progress in learning grammar. 750 Verbs is best for upper intermediate and advanced students who already have a very solid foundation in conjugating verbs in the many different tenses, and are now looking for more choices in expressing thoughts or specifically adding to their verb vocabulary. As other reviewers have noted, be aware that this book does not help whatsoever in showing you HOW to conjugate verbs--you'll have to get that elsewhere."
5,Great starting point!,"This is a great handbook for those who are just starting their journey with Jesus! Excellent basic, foundational stuff with Scripture references to go along with these important truths."
5,weighted belt,i love it! just recently started walking daily and this is an excellent addition to my workout. the 6lbs weight gives me enough resistance to burn more calories as i walk. im happy with this purchase and would definitely recommend this to those who wants to burn more calories in their workouts.
5,Almost as good as the live performance,"The first party I've ever been to featured dubtribe sound system that night and turned me on to raving. The vibe was awesome! The new CD is a great album too. The 72 minute set will get you groovin no matter if you are in a car, house, or party. These hippies produce some excelent beats and powerful lyrics and vocals. Check dubtribe out live, their North American tour is in progress. Get the CD and keep the vibe alive. One Love"
3,Naysayer says: not for everyone,"I've heard great things about DSS, and that's obviously the case here too. A word of warning must be made for purists, however. As nice as it is to get a somewhat less than subliminal self-help seminar (YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL...) in music, I'd prefer more music and less shmoozing on the mike. I'd give a nod of respect to the bilingual inclusion si las palabras no fueran tan tontas.[too poppy] The stink of disco is also rife, making it hard to groove with a clear conscience. This is a unique act, undoubtedly more interesting live than the average loopers, but they do not excell on any particular level."
5,Better than being there (Almost),"When I got this book from my bro, I really was glad he gave it to me because, This book is so good that it's almost like being there! Full of outstanding photos and outstanding writing by Dan and the essays by people such as Bob Costas , James Earl Jones, Bucky Dent are verry verrry interesting and almost magical. It's so good, I read it in 2 days! I hope they keep Fenway, unless it's absolutly time for it to be torn down, Any baseball fan should get this book, because after Fenway is gone,it's history!"
3,90% Perfect,"Great pictures, makes for some great reminiscing - but will somebody tell Shaughnessy it's not cool to quote YOURSELF over and over again? Only the creepy feeling that he's trying to prove something detracts from an otherwise magnificent book."
3,Fun to peruse but who choose the dust cover?,"I would love to know who choose that dust cover. There is the Green Monstah. Certainly an icon. Three icons played that wall in my lifetime. Two hall of famers Ted and Yaz,and a should be hall of famer Jim Rice, and pictured is a montreal expo."
3,Its small!!,"Don't be fooled. This is a small calendar. The pictures are drawings of the movie characters. Don't get me wrong, I like it and its definately going up on my wall, but it wasn't what I expected at all!"
3,Don't expect anything beyond the basics,"If you just want to find the bonus areas and dk coins and have a general idea of what's in each level, then this guide is for you. Unfortunately, there are no maps and very little strategy included. The boss strategies are okay but nothing life-saving. This guide isn't terrible, but could include much more important stuff in it. I do not own the Prima Guide to DKC2, but it couldn't be much worse than this."
4,Witness at the Bridge,"Amy Page and Jean-Michel Jolivet are in love and trouble has found themagain. The security of the Ile Saint-Louis is disrupted by a murder andattack on Amy that leaves her with a gunshot wound and having killed a man.A second attacker is also shot and winds up dead in the hospital.Though a link between the murder and the attack on Amy is suspected, thereseems to be no link other than her mild acquaintance with the dead man.Jean-Michel is worried too, that Amy might be charged with murder for owningan undeclared gun.The love story between Amy and Jean-Michel takes center stage in this funread. Talented author Gini Anding knows the city of Paris well as herdescriptions show, giving the reader the sense of being there.A talented combination of romance and mystery, this story is a well toldtale that will please the pickiest romantic or mystery buff. Lots of actionas the story unfolds.I'm pleased to recommend this book to any reader who likes a good read.Enjoy. I did."
2,I prefer the diaper stacker bags,"I got this as a baby shower gift. I thought it would be a great and useful item, but it ended up taking up a lot of room on the shelves of the changing table and doesn't really hold a lot of diapers.Also, I use a wipe warmer, so this is too tall to fit the warmer on top of it under the shelf of the changing table.I found that the diaper stacking bag that matched my crib set held a lot more diapers, and also took up less room because it can hang off the side of the table."
5,LOVE IT,This is my favorite diaper depot. I also have the Munchkin (sp?) and like this one much better. It is a must have for parents with little ones in diapers!
4,Great Space Saver,"We use this to organize creams, wipes and diapers on the changing table. It keeps the area clear or clutter and we use it every couple of hours, so I can't complain. If I could change one thing I would want it to hold a few more diapers. I would recommend this to a friend and would purchase it again."
3,Not for cloth diapers,"I wanted a changing table organizer, but this just wasn't big enough for my cloth diapers so I had to return it. The quality seemed good, and I really wanted to like it, but it just didn't work for me."
2,Does not fit all wipe warmers,"This says it fits all prince lionheart warmers. Not true, I had to return it and purchase another model which then fit"
1,"Love the product, HATE the lack of return policy","I received this organizer two years ago for my baby shower and I love the convenience of having everything I need to care for my baby in one neat area at my fingertips as opposed to having to fish through baskets/drawers etc. So when we were expecting again and setting up another nursery, I purchased this product from Amazon. Little did I know that it would arrive broken and the return policy for this item expired 48 hours after it had arrived at my home. I didn't open the box right away as it contained holiday gifts as well- now I'm out the money and I went and purchased another one from a retail store."
1,Received Broken,"Perhaps this would've worked well in our nursery; however, when I opened the amazon.com box, and opened the product's box, I found it broken in two spots. Very disappointed and this was the worst experience I've had with amazon."
3,Just okay,"I am confused because I was expecting the PL wipes warmer to fit nicely in this organizer by the same company, but it just sits awkwardly on top. Seems as though it would be easy to come up with something much better that actually fits the warmer securely. Oh well."
4,Works great,"I'm a very organized person, so when I saw this diaper caddy I thought it would work and the price was great. I love how it holds many things. The only dissapointing thing is that the top doesn't hold a huggies wipes container perfectly, it sits a little cockeyed....but if you don't let that bother you its great to keep everything together instead of all over the place, I have it in the living room on the coffee table! I'm certainly glad I bought it!"
3,ok for a short time,"I have had this item for about 4 months and recently got rid of it, I had it set on the diaper changing table it fit only one powder and the tube of diaper rash cream barely fit in it. I could'nt use both side shelves because it took up to much space on the changing table. It held a good amount of diapers in it and the wipe case fit just fine. But in the past two months my daughter is becomeing a squirmer and she wants to touch everything in the organizer and she kicking it everywhere on the table, in a sense it was to big for the table, and the other day she knocked it off the table and the top shelf cracked and so I had to throw it out. Over all I think it's ok, but I wish I had it when she was younger so it would'nt have ended up on the floor"
5,Perfect!,"The dresser top Diaper Depot is a great thing to have in the nursery. The Prince Lionheart wipe warmer sits perfectly on top of it. I did not need the space to store diapers, but use that area for Q-tips, lotion, thermometer, etc. It has really organized the changing area for us. I highly recommend it!"
1,Did not like this at all,"In theory, this looks like it might be useful. However, the side compartments are really small. Not even an average size bottle of cornstarch can fit in it. When I try go to remove something from there, like a tube of cream, the plastic side piece detaches and I have to click it back into place (all of these pieces can disconnect, which could be nice, but I found that they would disconnect when I did not want them to). The diaper areas in the front do not hold many diapers at all. The top doesn't have a non slip grip, so the box of wipes just slides all over. PAIN IN THE REAR. I returned this and bought a large basket that I keep on the changing table edge and just put all my supplies into."
4,Review,"Very handy space saver. I have a diaper wipe warmer that I keep on top, it is a little too big and does not sit completely flat.I like the side pieces, you can remove them and I have them both side by side sitting on the dresser... works out better for my space that way.pretty good organizer for the price."
3,Good basic e-mail machine with 2 major annoyances,"Annoyances first- 2 large 2"" X 2"" stickers on the front of the case that won't peel off easily. It takes a lot of work and ""Goo Gone"" to get them off.- 2 screws holding the hard drive in are almost inaccessible. You need a special philips screwdriver with a right angle neck that is less than one inch long and a mirror and flashlight to get to them.I gave the machine only 3 stars because it is a 2.93 GHz processor that doesn't seem any faster than my old HP 7955 1.5GHz machine. I've had the machine 2 weeks now.There is no floppy drive, but $35 and a little time will solve this problem if you need it.Multi-media slots on the front are nice.Power supply and CPU fans are VERY quiet. I even checked to insure they were running."
5,PERFECT!,"I ordered 10 of these VERY last minute for an event and I did not have time to read much in the description or the review. They arrived next day as I needed and while they are mini, they are a really nice size to sit on a desk or shelf. The packaging was in great shape and I was able to get them all autographed for my event :-)"
3,Not upto the expectation,"This album doesn't live upto the expectations. As one of JMJs newest albums, I atleast expected it to be a bit different or could there've been a variety, But It's more disappointing. With the available latest technology and in this digital world, He had more scope to produce a much better music than this."
4,An excellent sequel to the first Oxygene,"Jean-Michel Jarre returns to his roots on this album, and it shows. The man who paved the path for electronic music is always good for creating a stir, but this album is just made for pure aural enjoyment. After a few somewhat disappointing efforts, this album puts Jarre right back on track."
5,The mutts nuts,"A follower of JMJ since getting Oxygene for Christmas back in '84,i thought Equinoxe was the best sounding album but having heard 7-13 i have changed my opinion.Get yourself a surround sound processor and play Oxygene 7 through all 5 speakers.A fantastic album."
2,A disappointing totally ambient mix that lacks in content,"Jean Michael Jarre is a totally ambient mix with no predominating intruments, no melody, no superb parts, no beats/drums, and no real bass to compliment any of his songs. If you want music to break the silence of, say, reading a book, this might be good. If you want music to listen to, save your money and find another CD."
1,Regurgitation,"Oxygene 1-6 (1976) made a distinct limitless impression. A classic 5 star project. Emotional stylized music structures floating in a realm where inner and outer space form an ambiguous dimentionless continuum. Question: Is it realistic trying to repeat such an accompishment? Answer: Oxygene 7-13! Dehydrated broken bones glued together in semi-familiar patterns. Insistently planar dinosauric compositions drudgingly plod along old trails. In an age of developing synthesizer technology Jean-Michel affectionatly stuck with his paleolithic analog keyboards. One might argue that you never know until you try. Well trying is one thing, but publishing it as part of your legacy is lunatic. This CD marks the nadir in an exponential decline since Oxygene 1-6."
5,"Similar to the first, but an entirely different beast.","People seem really split over this one.The swirling chords and wistful melodies from the first, classic Oxygene are still present here -- but this is an entirely different sound. This album has, dare I say, more of a dance beat to it, and more of a 'techno' feel.I almost hate to admit it, but this disc finds it way into my changer much more often than the original. I don't know why, I guess I just like it a bit better -- and I know that's sacrelige to the diehard Jarre fan.Personal favorite moment: The last few minutes of the first track, Oxygene 7. I was listening to this part when I first saw word of the 9/11 attacks online. That tune and the event are inseparable in my mind now. When the rain effect comes in with that doomsday arpeggio, I can't help the tears. Powerful stuff."
4,Fairly-Fresh Air,"Not expecting much, I was pleasantly surprised how much I was spellbound by this ""Oxegene"" follow-up. (And In some sense a ""re-mix"") Jarre manages to mix the lively with the bleak, turning ""Oxegene 7-13"" into a a dance/meditative/nocturnal highway trip hybrid. ( Which may be a weakness as well as a stength to some, but...) The first ""60%"" is most effective, then starts running out of steam, but worth the purchase If you're into trance/techno."
3,Not Bad Brainless AIP Jim Brown Vehicle,"Though the original is preferred if only for some stunning Stella Stevens nude scenes, this is pretty entertaining on its own terms. Unfortunately, Ed McMahon (!) plays it straight in the bad guy role, when I was really hoping for some of the ol' ""John P. Ryan As the Fake Nathan White"" scenery chewing."
2,blower motor wrong one for my vehicle 2003 cavalier,"This part does not fit, being returned. It would help customers if the parts stated the OEM# that they replace, otherwise it's a guessing game whether they are correct or not. I'm going to shop for parts at sites that do state -part # xxx replaces OEM part #xxx .This way I'll be guaranteed the correct part instead of the expense and hassle of returning them. The reason for 2 stars is that this item was packed well and shipped fast. I can't say what the blower is like as it doesn't fit."
4,Should be required reading for engaged couples,"Although some of the advice is common sense for many couples (i.e. your problems don't go away when you get married), i think that overall it's useful for couples to discuss their different emotions and to get people communicating. and, let's face it, we all know at least one couple who needs to be told that problems in the relationship don't go away with marriage."
2,Thought this was a Christian study...,"A couple of the chapters in this workbook are worth while to do with your significant other--they give you a chance to talk about things that will affect your marriage eventually and help you and yours discuss these things and work them out before they can become a problem. But I don't recall any discussion about God, the Bible, or even any Bible verses being used to get there point across. Basically, this book says, ""Enjoy the time you have together now because when you get married, it's all downhill from there and it's going to take a lot of work with no benefits to keep it going."" That's truly the impression I got from reading the book and doing the workbook. In all fairness, I did quite reading the book and doing the study before I got to the end but only because I couldn't take anymore of their ""reality-check."" Truth is, you can have a wonderful marriage, that stays lively and full of love throughout your entire life. Bogus book/workbook. Stay away."
4,Very helpful,We were about to leave for Alaska and this book give us some really helpful information.
1,Alaska for Dummies lacks depth,"I bought this book before I left for Northwestern Alaska. There are several National Parks there which this book totally ignored. The Western Arctic Parks & the Gates of the Arctic weren't even mentioned. In the Nome reference the only real remark was the end of the Iditarod. There is so much more happening especially in the summer when the sun doesn't set. Kotzebue wasn't covered except for a museum that is currently closed. If you are not going to northern AK the book may be helpful, if you're going north of Fairbanks, don't bother."
4,Alaska for Dummies,"I enjoyed reading about Alaska. i have several ""Dummies"" books and find them humorously informative!"
5,A Valedictory,"This collection may be the last of John Denver's recordings to have been released. Although none of the songs are new, they are all marked by a maturity of voice and expression which sets them apart from prior versions. John once remarked that he was surprised by the fact that he could find new meaning in songs he had been performing for 20 or more years. Even though we've heard the songs many times, these performances are enlightened by a freshness and vitality and honest emotion that make them sound new. It's as if John is saying, ""Here's where I've come to, after all these years. What do you think?""The quality of the recorded sound is outstanding and deserves special mention. It's among the finest I have heard. It's almost like he is sitting on the other side of the room from you."
5,"Clean, Uncluttered, Brilliant","This is by far my favourite JD CD. There's no electronic frippery, no cast of thousands arrangements. Recorded in Nashville, it is a mature work that showcases what John did best - his songwriting and his singing. ""Perhaps Love"" in a simple, acoustic arrangement is the highlight for me."
3,Stick to the originals,"I'm a big Denver fan, but the original recordings to me were near perfect. I purchased this because everyone gave it such rave reviews. Yes, his voice is strong, but it also seems more forced - like he was trying to prove how well he could sing. Several of the recordings reminded me of someone trying to sing them in a choir, with vibrato and vocal tricks.Call me stubborn, but I think that only seriously serious Denver fans need this cd in their collection. If you like comparing one recording to the other, then by all means, buy it. If you want memories, stick to the originals."
5,Best purse EVER!,"I really hate buying purses.This one however is a pleasure to have! People keep stopping me to check it out. What a brilliant idea! My husband says that if anyone ever bothered me or tried to take it I could just hit them with it. It is a little heavy,but it's very sturdy. I would recommend this to anyone!"
3,Great Bag,"I love this purse! It is very durable and cleans very easily. The only negative is that with the type of material it is made of, it can get heavy."
2,Not bad but not what I wanted,"I wanted a large bag that would serve as a diaper bag without being a diaper bag. Bag is smaller than a ""large"" should be. Also, color is not as bright as it appears in the pictures; is much more muted. I ended up getting the messenger bag as it is larger and it fits my needs much better."
4,A Good Book To Have Around,"As you may already know, this is the pocket-sized version of Mickey Flodin's ""Perigee Dictionary of Sign."" Filled with clear illustrations, descriptions of each sign and memory aids as well, this book is a wonderful resource to carry with you for ""emergencies."" Don't depend on this to give you enough vocabulary to have a real conversation, but do consider it a valuable tool in many social circumstances. As a Deaf ASL teacher, I can recommend this book to anyone who wants to carry with them a safety net! :o)"
5,This book can help everyone learn basic sign language,This book helped my whole family learn basic sign language in only a few short hours. I have tried numerous books but this one is the best. I couldn't say more than if you are looking for a book on how to sign...start here it is the best place to start or to brush up on basic knowledge.
1,NO help to me,"I have had the WORST luck with this book. As a music teacher, I often use signs to supplement the songs we sing - both in class and in performance. However, out of maybe 35 words I've looked up in this ""dictionary"", I've found the signs for about five! Words like ""special"" and ""place"" are NOT in this book, although they should be.Not recommended."
5,Pocket Dictionary of Signing,This book really helped me to learn words and put together common phrases to sign. It has been helpful in learning that there are many ways to say similar things. Great to use for a reference.
1,What a great disappointment,"This product was not what I thought it would be.There is absolutely no artwork on this disc. It is a book of lists about the creators of Classics Illustrated. The author includes some of the actual dialogue that is used in the comics. Well, for what reason? If you want dialogue now is the time to actually read the actual, original books. I returned my copy immediately."
5,A Great Guide to Hiring,Excellent!! A very well written and well thought out approach to hiring not just people but great people.
1,Nothing special,I have read this book and was unable to find anything new or interesting in it about selecting employees.
1,How to complicate something simple,"I read the complete book hoping to get to the section that would make it worth while. Never got there.The authors manage to make an interesting subject boooooring, and their language becomes at times needlessly complicated. Example: why not call competencies by another name instead of confusing it with competenccy requirements, and having to overexplain the differences between the two?Like most books, it provides issues to be learned, and I learned; but there are many other attractive, interesting, and more informatiave options."
3,Just so-so,"This album is kind of soft. I was a little let down by this effort. It is worth the price of the CD, but it is something that will probably not stay in my player for too long. Just a little too mellow for me."
5,"such a good listening experience, adam continues to impress","this cd is really well put together. i have listened to it about 20 or 30 times now and i just got it yesterday. i think the ""mrs. potter's lullaby"" is really good as well as ""i wish i was a girl"" and ""high life"". the whole album is excellent. that is what i love about the counting crows, you can play the whole cd though never hitting a bad song. oh one last note, ""four days"" talks about ohio, i was so excited. two thumbs up!"
2,A huge disapointment,"this album was disappointing, after waiting for it for so long and listening to all the hype it was a let down. the music is more country-western than the counting crows i used to know."
5,this cd is the epitomy of poetry,"This recording is definitely NOT a flash in the pan, those who say that have zero taste and simply cannot understand true poetry. Some people have said that Jim Morrison is the electric poet...this is not true, it is Adam Duritz, hands down, he throws his heart out on the line for everyone to see on this album. If you can truly HANDLE this cd then you will love it. A must have at all costs."
3,Left me wanting something more..,"As a Crows fan, I anxiously anticipated the arrival of ""This Desert Life"". I was exposed to 'hanginaround' on local radio and expected the album to be as musically upbeat , but it's not. My first listen, I went straight through track by track waiting for something instrumentally or lyrically eventful, but it never came. I have kept the CD in my changer and one of the songs will pop up from time to time as it shuffles. This is the way to enjoy this album. In small doses. I can still listen to AAEA and RTS over and over and over and over. ""This Desert Life"" may grow on me over time, but I doubt I will ever enjoy it the way I have enjoyed the first two. It doesn't need to be wrapped up in a package of lies and sent off to a coconut island, it just left me wanting something more."
4,Great Music,"This CD was really good. Kind of depressing at times, but the first and second songs are pretty happy. It's a very relaxing CD to listen to though and mellow."
3,A good effort,"As one of Counting Crows hugest fans, this album showed a different side of them to me. I saw them live at the 9:30 club in DC the Saturday before the album was released. I think this album is much happier sounding than previous albums, with the exception of ""Colorblind"", my favourite track on the whole album. Other good song is ""Amy Hit the Atmosphere"". Great tune. But personally, I prefer the heavier, more angsty stuff, but this is definetely going to stay in my CD player for awhile until it grows on me."
3,"Good, but not great..","To tell the truth, I was not a Counting Crows fan. But, after getting this CD for Christmas, I have kinda changed my mine. Granted, this is not exactly their best CD, and they aren't exactly my favorite band, but there are some songs on here that really shine, and I think I'll try out some of their other CDs..."
4,A pretty solid album,"I can't say that i like this album better than CC's previous two (or three if you count Across the Wire). But don't let some of these reviews fool you: it's not worse either. It's a bit different from the first two because there aren't any songs as fast-paced as ""Mr. Jones"" or ""Angels of the Silences."" It is a mellow album, but soulful. I didn't love it after the first or second listen. But the songs grow on you--the Van Morrisonesque ""Hanginaround,"" the slow build up of the traveling ""Mrs. Potter's Lullaby"" and the pleading ""I Wish I Was a Girl."" You'll catch yourself humming these songs before long. And let's be honest: the only thing you want from this review is whether I think the album is worth your money. Definitely."
4,Crows continue to redefine themselves with This Desert Life,"I have to admit that on first listen to This Desert Life, I felt that my anxiety for its arrival was overstated. However, the more I listen to it, the more I realize just how good this album is. I can see that true fans will love this and those who were lukewarm to the Crows before will remain that way. I found this to be a much more technically precise album with some interesting overlapping sounds that is mostly atypical of the previous CC efforts. While this is not my favorite of their 3 albums, it is strong enough to keep me listening over and over and thirsting already for the next offering from Counting Crows. For all you nay-sayers, yes, Adam is self-indulgent and whiny as can be, but his passions cannot be denied. My recommendation? Go with it and enjoy the music, it's quality far exceeds most of the garbage being belched out by the corporate music machine, catering to the narrow-minded MTV crowd. Let's hear it for integrity!"
2,Sorry; but I expected more:,Recovering the Satelites had more hits on it than this one; the music is just not in sync as it has been with the other two; I may have been too excited & as a result was rather disapointed. For die hard fans only.
3,An average CD,"When I purchased this cd, I was looking forward to another great album from the Counting Crows, but I was very dissapointed after listening to the album. The sole bright spot is Hangin' Around, reminicent of the high quality of music that the Crows are known for. But the rest of the album is mediocre to poor. Do not buy this album, unless you are just a huge fan of the band. Other top cuts: Four Days, All My Friends, Colorblind."
1,Their Worst CD Yet,"I thought the last one was bad, but this takes the cake. Whine, whine, whine. The guy spends his time hanging out in bars and banging actresses. What's so bad about that? I would trade places with him in a second if he wasn't bald."
1,Save yourself some money,"This CD really bites. Hanginaround, though a fly tune in and of itself, is false advertising for this CD. While that tune is the crank it up, pull some tubes feel good hit of the winter, the rest of the disc drones on like a slowly dying animal. Save yourself some money and just listen to Hanginaround on the radio."
5,GOOOOOOOD STUFF,very good album. especially track 8. i could never get sick of listening to anything counting crows.
3,somewhat mediocre,"The band's first CD still stands out among their 3 studio albums. ""Four Days"" sounds slightly reminicent of R.E.M. and their song ""So. Central Rain(I'm Sorry)"" This CD is not too memorable. Stick with only their 1st CD if you are a new fan."
2,"Excitingly different, then more of the same!","I thought for a moment I had actually heard Adam Duritz smile. I bought the CD after hearing Hanginaround and thought the Crows had decided to go a different, exciting direction in their music and not be so dark and gloomy. I listened, track 1 was great, I listened some more, track 2 (Mrs. Potters Lullabye) was also upbeat and enjoyable. And then it happened, similar to Recovering the Satellites though worse, the album went flat. The remaining eight tracks are more or less interchangeable. After two albums of angst and sorrow, its time for the Crows (or Adam since he wrote almost all of it)to go in a different direction. This Desert Life starts down that road but inevitably and predictably ends up where August and Satellites did, a dark, desolate, lonely place that 75% of the Crows songs seem to be about."
5,Great Album !!!!!,"This is a great album! The songs that really put the album together are... Oh yea The whole album is perfect!!! If your looking at this album it is a grfeat thing to buy. Can you find out why there is a big break after the song ""St. Robinson in his Cadillac Dream"" Well I have. I hope you find out!!!"
4,"still contemplative, still great...","Adam Duritz can still write great tunes, and that is the core of counting crows appeal, to me at least. this album evokes a gamut of emotions: upbeat, reflective, morose, amused, but always contemplative as Adam tends to be. the band still does a great job of expressing Adam's lyrics musically, and they will probably continue to be compared to other bands because this is the way most people tend to listen to music; they want to categorize the band as they compare to other bands so it's easier to know if you should like them or not. Counting Crows may have their influences, but they are definitely unique among their contemporaries. this album has been in my cd player for over a month and I haven't tired of it yet. if you liked the other albums (all songs, not just the hits) you should like this album too. i just hope we don't have to wait two years for the next one."
3,"Different, Not necesarily in the good way...","This CD is okay. It is not a bad CD and some of the songs are quite good. But, overall, this CD leaves me feeling unsatisfied and I rarely have the desire to put this one in the player. Plus, while the background noise and chatter may be considered ground breaking and innovative to some, I found it ultimately annoying. If you don't own a Counting Crows CD, don't start with this one, start with their first CD, it is fantastic."
3,artowrk?,"okay, so basically, the album's fine, and seems a bit of a soundtrack to soemone's slightly depressing life. Mostly I snagged this from my roommate becuase because I was makng a desprete attempt to discover The Truth about the cover art. It has to be Dave McKean, I mean, it the picture straight off of the day I Swapped my Dad, I mean, come on. If they don't site him it would have to be so illegal. This album could, however, have benefited greatly form Neil Gaiman writing the lyrics. If that were the case, I might not have given it back to the roommate at all. But alas, it was not to be, and instead, I've got a friend who's content to belive that ""my friends"" is about his life, and another who constantly torments me with colourblind. Which isn't that bad, just overplayed around me. It's an okay album, WHO/where did they get the art?"
4,Bracingly Positive and Upbeat and Hopeful,"After the roots rock triumph of their debut album and the dense, experimental sounds of the 2nd effort, I didn't know what to expect on the 3rd. Adam Duritz has pared down the sound and simplified things. These are straightforward, laid-back songs, yet deeply personal. Duritz strips away musical pretentions and lets the true gift of his songwriting show through. Mrs. Potter's Lullaby is the highlight for me, a long Dylan-esque ramble that sounds like Adam simply pouring out everything he would ever want to tell anyone about life. It is bracingly positive and upbeat and hopeful. Strange things to be coming from a man reported to be perpetually on the brink of depression."
1,All i have to ask is: what is with the cover?,"I dont know much about the album, but what is with the album cover? Pink Floyd used nearly the same picture many years ago when they released ""Wish You Were Here"" as a single. The only difference in Floyd's cover is that there is a man and a woman with fish bowls for heads. Notice the ""two lost souls"" swimming in the fish bowl... get it? :)"
2,Not a radio friendly CD,"OK. I'm not a die hard Counting Crows fan like some other reviewers. I bought this album based on the 1st single (""hanginaround"") and my liking of August and Everything After. If you are looking for more songs like ""hanginaround"", forget it. The rest of the songs are much more somber and slow. Although the lyrics are good, I would also like to have a good tune to keep me going."
1,for pop it's OK but for CC it's awful,this is not the kind of music we've come to expect from the counting crows. there are no songs here to really go crazy for... it's nothing compared to the other two albums.
1,"The new album is like a happy version of ""August...""","This is a great album. I highly recommend it. It has a very Bob Dylan like sound, but as only the Crows could do it. It seems to have alot of country and Van Morrison type influences. Already one of my favorite albums that I own."
1,Was that all?,"I had meant to write this review much earlier, i.e. right after I had rushed to buy TDL after a much too long wait for Counting Crow's new offering after two excellent albums. Need I tell you that I was dead disappointed? While ""August ..."" was my favourite 1994 album and ""Recovering..."" showed that the Crows can rock, TDL is a step in the wrongest of directions. The sound is probably meant to be ""experimental"" but in fact the Crows often sound like CSNY practising. Simplistic tunes (the awful ""Hanging around""), childlike guitar play and repetitive choruses, combined with weakish lyrics - nowhere near as gripping as on the two previous CD's - make this a very bad buy of which ""I wish a was a girl"" and ""All my friends"" are the only recordable songs. I hope and pray this was only a provisional low before Counting Crows get a grip on themselves again."
1,The title sums it up- the album is a wasteland!,"Being a Crows fan, I eagerly anticipated this album. It seems the two year vacation, was more of a retirement party."
5,There's no stopping these guys...,"Not since the Beatles ""White Album"" has this reviewer listened to such symphonic bliss. The 'Crows mix of blues, rock, and classical influence has me in awe. While most mainstream bands today seem to run out of steam after their first album of two, the 'Crows just seem to get better. The reign of the Rain King, the saga of Elizabeth, the uplift intertwined with the saddness. It not only makes for an unparalleled musical experience, but it's damn fine storytelling at it's best. Keep up the good work, guys.M.J.'00"
4,Great Music,This CD is by far my favorite Counting Crows recording. It has a great mix of music styles that are upbeat and fun. It is a must have for any Counting Crows fan.
3,Not August and Everything After,"The fundamental problem with putting out one of the best debut albums ever is that it's so hard to live up to it. As with ""Recovering the Satellites,"" Counting Crows has put out a really good album that isn't ""August and Everything After."" The album is solid, with ""Colorblind"" being a particularly outstanding track. But in the end, it has just too many little irritating things: their seeming obsession with putting strange noises at the start of their tracks, the curious mixing choices, and a few too many attempts at musical experimentation that just don't quite work all mar an album which would be truly incredible. Worth grabbing. Just be ready to get through it and wish they could put out their first album again."
5,Their best yet!,"Although you'll want to own their first two albums, this is by far their best yet. It's combines the best elements of August and Recovering with a fiery new creativity. I love the new production sound. For anyone who loves Adam's voice but felt the music was always slightly generic, this is the CD for you."
4,Back to top form...,"A real slow burner, This Desert Life is an improvement on Recovering The Satellites...but give it a chance!On first appraisal TDL is very disappointing, the sound of Duritz churning out the same emotions as if on auto-pilot. After a few plays, however, it reveals its true spirit, akin to August and Everything After, and running it damned close for true brilliance.In reality, it's the two most upbeat tracks, Hangin' Around and St Robinson in his Cadillac Dream, that are the drawbacks. They sound tagged on and lukewarm and it would have worked better without them. That said, everything else is classic Counting Crows.Particular favourites are High Life, Colorblind and the staggering live favourite Speedway, which is incredibly emotional and begs out for a repeat of the chorus, but still hits very hard.A must."
4,desert life rocks,"Counting Crows have done it again with this beautiful album that ties together upbeat songs, with the occasional melencholy and refelective tune. A great listen!"
4,A more mature offering,"By this point you know what Counting Crows will supply: solid musicianship, haunting vocals, and songs of pain, happiness and the other vagaries of life. There's more maturity to be found on this one then in the past. The songs have a substance to them that was lacking in the midst of the previous cd's bombast; perhaps Durvitz is not trying too hard anymore. Sure there's the occasional drift into the bizarre (""Colorblind?"")but the themes have entered a new phase of sophistication, and the band has grown with them. They may never make the perfect album, but they've never disappointed me. (I love the use of Dave Mckean's art as well. It seems so perfect for this band.)"
2,Disappointing,"I am definitely a counting crows fan and looked forward to this cd, but was disappointed after one time through. Most of the songs sound so similar to the fist 2 cds that it's hard to be excited about something new. I'm actually surprised to read all the favorable comments. If you like routine and familarity, you will like this cd. Also, seemed short, 10 songs...maybe it's just me...and the bonus song to me wasn't really a bonus."
4,Not for the casual listener...,"Both the music and the writing on this album are intense, personal, and full of subtle depth. My own favorite track is ""High Life"", one of the most intense and emotional tracks I own from any artist, and one which gives me something important on a very deep level each time I listen to it. Other highlights are ""All My Friends"" and ""Speedway"". Not to be missed."
4,Great Followup,"This is a good listen, only if you are a true Counting Crows fan. Songs number 1 and 2 are the best. Just to own the CD for the hit song Hangingaround is worth the cost. Check out the sound bites and give this third Counting Crows CD a try!"
4,crows improvement,"The Counting Crows have not quite equaled their debut effort, but this Desert Life is a drastic improvement over their last cd. Standout songs are ""I wish I was a girl"" and ""Mrs.potter's lullaby"". If you like great songwriting, this is the album for you."
4,Counting Crows prove they are no 1 album wonder.,"Counting Crows and the voice is all you need to make a great CD...No, this is not their best work...but shows they have stamina and ability to write for their fans and not for radio industry standards....Good work fellas."
5,Mainly on Counting Crows in general,"Okay, I have to say that I started out liking the Counting Crows because of Mr. Jones. But it wasn't the melody or what that made me like it, it was the words and the way they switched around the different major minor thingies. I first heard HanginAround and I didn't know it was CC, and I had a blank tape in my cd player, and I taped it. I really liked, and I wanted to find out who wrote it, and then I was watching MCM, the french music channel, when I saw it, and I was so surprised. I really want to get this ALbum! I definitely (after hearing it) want to get the 1st and 3rd."
2,I Keep Hoping...,"That CC will put out another CD with the freshness and variety of the first, and I continued to be VERY disappointed. Recovering the Satellites was a major setback and this CD, although a noticeable improvement over that is still a far cry from the debut.Were these guys a ""One CD-Wonder""?Flash-in-the-Pan?I think so. Too bad."
2,rock responsibly,"The Crows' third studio album finds them settling at last into the comfy, riskless limbo where too many roots bands end up. If it lacks the townhome bluesisms that make an Edwin McCain so dreary, it's awash in the languor of talented musicians who are quite content to make languor sound appealing (decorate dull songs with sweet sounds; repeat as required). The interesting thing is that it's no longer singer Adam Duritz who drags them down -- he's less cloyingly earnest than ever. But his lyrics always need musical bolstering to keep from sounding self-obsessed, and this time they don't get it. ""I Wish I Was a Girl"" is melodramatic enough, but the songs about us staying and our friends going away never get anywhere."
4,This Desert Life is Not too Shabby,"After a small disappointing turn in ""Recovering the Satellites"", I found the latest edition of the Counting Crows saga, ""This Desert Life"" to be the charm the third time around. From the loosy-goosy melody in ""Hangin'around"" to the descriptive narrative throughout ""Mrs. Potters Lullaby"" to the great melody in ""All My Friends"", this CD is a great improvement above the previous album. Adam Duritz rules!"
4,It's good... but...,"I think i would have given This Desert Life 3 stars, had i not been a devout CC fan for so long. This is good music, but the songs get to be a little bland and Adam takes out a little too much whining. It's worth the buy, but AAEA is VASTLY better."
3,"It is average,okay mayber a little better than average.","Hey everybody if you like some of the slow stuff off of ""August"" this is your kind of album. I found it kind of boring. I was looking for a song like ""Rain King"" and I just can't find it. Hanginaround is kind of a nice hand clapper. I am sure that I will get sick of it after heavy play on the Top 40 stations. The nice thing about the counting crows is that after the radio plays the hell out of them, there are still songs that are left undiscovered by DJs. This Desert Life just doesn't hold have the undiscovered hits. It is kind of a let down to a guy that loves the slow stuff, but this is sort of depressing."
4,Crows Fly Again,"There are moments of absolute brilliance. ""Mrs. Potter' Lullaby"" and ""I Wish I Was"" contain Duritz's best lyrics to date. ""Four Days"" sounds like 'The Cure' with a guy who can actually sing. ""Speedway"" contains that brutal self-critique we've seen in Duritz before ie 'Perfect Blue Buildings'.He loses me a bit with 'Colorblind,' which is dull musically and a case study in self-absorption. There is a difference between self-analysis and self-pity, and Adam crosses the line on occasion.But in full, this is a terrific album. Not many 90s bands will be remembered twenty years from now. The Crows are one of the few who will survive."
5,Thank you counting crows!,"The first time I heard this cd, I fell in love with the music. I know it is gonna entertain me for many hours in the future, already. High Life and I Wish I Were a Girl are my new favorites, and Colorblind and Hangin Around have already been played multiple times. I was worried that the Crows would change their style, but I am so happy to say it plainly evolved into something new and different, and yet the same. So thank you Mr.Duritz and Company for another superb album!"
5,Run Don't Walk & Buy IT !,"How often do you wear out a CD...... well I wore out the Crows new, this Desert Life. Here's what happened. Upon my first listen I loved tracks 4-6-7-8. Then as time went on, I was captured by 1-2- and 3 and then WHAMMO............. I am on my 1,045,022 listen TRACKS 1-to-10. MUST I SAY MORE. I hope the mesermizing, I WISH I WAS A GIRL (a Tom Petty-ish cut) makes it to the air-waves. It sure blew me away and I'm a GUY! Bravo Adam and guys.........now when does the next one come out? Don't say in 2 years!"
2,Very Dissapointing,"I loved Counting Crow's last two albums, but this one is a big let down. The great thing about the Counting Crows was that they were able to combine touching lyrics with melodies that really can make you FEEL the emotions. This album doesn't really do either. The lyrics are not clever this time around. Instead of using imagery or metaphor, he just comes out and says stuff. A lot of it sounds trite. The instrumental stuff is pleasant to the ears, but it doesn't really touch me the same way as the other two albums."
4,"Brings back the ""August..."" vibe.","If you are a Crows fan left a little less than satisfied with ""...Satellites,"" then this album is what you've been waiting for. After ""Hanginaround,"" the songs settle into that moody vibe that permeated throughout ""August..."" Every song is a standout. I couldn't skip ahead or back through three full listenings. Duritz's vocals are beautiful and understated. This is the album I expected three years ago and am glad to see, after the overly electric ""...Satellites,"" the band is back to the kind of mellow rock that made their debut a classic."
5,"Quite pleasing, really","My feelings can be summed up very briefly: I've been listening to this CD nonstop since I bought it on its release date! I loved ""Hanginaround"" the first time I heard it, and it's not even the best song on the CD. That honor goes to the catchy ""I Wish I Was A Girl"" - even though I have yet to figure out what the title has to do with the song... :-)"
4,A fitting sequel to the first two,"A very solid and wonderful album, both melodically and lyrically. Adam continues to pierce to the depths of the human soul with his words as he has always done. Definitely worth the wait, and extends the imagery that the first two albums dealt with. The design of the CD booklet is a masterpiece in itself. All in all, this is an album worth listening to for a very long time."
5,A wonderful flow from one song to the next. I LOVE IT!,"I really enjoy this album. It has a great sound to it. In particular, I'm amazed how each song compliments the next--beautiful melodies, thoughtful lyrics, sad songs, happier songs, a wonderful interwoven mix of LIFE itself--it's great to know the 90's hasn't entirely collapsed inward with the ""Backstreet Boys-NSYNC-Ricky Martin"" mindless type of music. The COUNTING CROWS is a tribute to classic rock yet with a twang of alternatism.Adam and the group here certainly march to a different drum -- a few songs have the poetic license of Bob Dylan to them...a few remind me of Allman ""Brother-ish"" styles..I also love how the theme, ""This Desert Life,"" is mixed in with the songs..Great messages and harmonies to this CD..Get it! Enjoy it!"
4,"An excellent album, overall.","Well, I personally really liked this album. I was a little disappointed that there were no songs with the emotional pull of ""'Round Here"" or ""A Long December"", though. ""Amy Hit the Atmosphere"" is a similar-sounding song, but not quite the lyrical tour-de-force that the earlier songs were. What makes up for this, I think, is the new sounds the band brought to the album. The band seems to have divided up the songs better than in previous efforts, so the album doesn't have that ""It's all about Adam"" sound. I've only had the CD two days, so maybe I haven't listened closely enough, but I think the only thing that keeps this from being a 5-star CD is that the band seems to have taken the critics' complaints about Adam's ""whininess"" a little too seriously."
3,It's a B+,"I liken this album to getting an 88% on an exam. Sure, it's respectable...even very good. But it's a far cry (whine) from the flawless, 'August' and equally impressive 'Recovering.'"
3,"Good album, but not Great album.","I'm a big CC fan, so of course I had to have it. This album however, I don't believe its a must have for a CC first timer. It took me a couple times before I really got into it. The thing about the album, is that there really isn't a song that you think will be a big hit. It's full of good songs well written, but they don't come out and grab you. The first two albums, had many songs that were big hits. If you love CC you will Like this album (not Love). If you don't care to much for CC then definitely, don't waste your time."
5,One of the best of the year,"This album is excellent. It seems to open a new door for Duritz and the band. It is full of yearning and looking ahead, rather than dwelling on the past. ""Mrs. Potter's Lullabye"" is one of my favorite songs ever, almost Dylanesque in scope. It's really long but you wish it would keep going, as you wish the album would as well. I also like how the really annoying guitar player is not quite so prominent on this album, seeing as he almost ruined ""Recovering the Satellites"" for me."
2,Disappointed,"I'm a big Counting Crows fan: I loved their first cd and I think their second cd was also good. Their live double album was great, full of emotion, and made me more interested in their music than before. So I was really excited to hear this, their latest album, knowing I'd love it. Well after listening to it, trying to like it (really trying!), I realized that it just didn't stack up to August and Everything After and Recovering the Satellites. While I must note that the Counting Crows are rather brave for creating a new sound, a very different, jazzy-style sound, I don't think they needed to sacrifice their lyrical strength for it. I do think that the new sound is somewhat catchy. However, I'm not sold on it, and I think that they seem to have lost their knack for great lyrics."
5,Excellent CD,"The band has really changed thier style of music since August&Everything After. When I first listened to teh whole CD i didnt particulary like or dislike it. But after a few times of listening, I realized that I really really like it. Tracks 2, 5, 8, and 10 are really exceptional, and the rest of the CD is very nice as well. Hope that you enjoy it as much as I do."
3,Nice 90's Music,"This is the music of my 20's, and listening to it always reminds me of those good times.the songs are good and totally in line with he 90's feel"
5,nice addition for my record collection,"well i finally got this on vinyl and from start to finish this album is easily my top ten albums of all time . the lyrics are serious and thoughtful , instruments perfected , and its just such a real album i am so happy to add it to my collection so i would get this do not sleep on this album . just remember to listen all the way through"
4,You can always count on the Counting Crows!,"When I first heard Hanginaround on the radio I knew I had to get this latest effort by the Crows, even though I hadn't heard any of the other songs on the disc. I was not disappointed. Mrs. Potter's Lullaby and St. Robinson In His Cadillac Dream are outstanding works. There isn't a bad cut on the disc, including the hidden cut after St. Robinson. You have to wait about 4 minutes for it, but wait, it is worth it! I like this disc better than Recovering the Sattelites and August and Everything After. Can't wait for their next disc!"
1,Slap me awake all you CC fans.,"This is my first Counting Crows CD and I like the way it starts out with ""Hanging Around"". I have been listening to this CD at work so I have plenty of time to finish it but I never do. Sheesh, when I am listening to this CD I will take out my earphones and listen to co-workers argue about college football. I just read the reviews and they give the impression that the CD will grow on you and ""St. Robinson"" is a great song. I am listening to the song now and I am highly motivated to hit the CD eject button. Aww, that is better, I appreciate this CD a lot more when I no longer hear it."
2,Very disappointing: broken promises.,"After two great works (three, if you include the auto celebrative Live) CC's totally failed to reach the target. No rythm, no passion, no emotion: please, Adam & C, don't listen to the syrens and come back to what you are, a great simple pop group. Next chance will be the last one, I believe, to understand if CC's are history or dust."
2,Found this CD in my son's computer,"In December '07, I pay a visit to my grandsons in New Jersey and I found a strange song in the computer of my son. The title: ""St. Robinson in his Cadillac dreams"" of Counting Crows and........I like it. I collect LPs and CDs of popular music from 1960 from USA and United Kingdom. For me is the only song of this CD that I recommend"
1,Half a star,"Sorry to spoil the party, but this cd is like Counting Crows trying to be like Counting Crows."
2,This Desert Flop,"The sad clown act has worn thin on many fans of their first album. The Crows follow Recovering the Satelites with another sad sack, depressive, no punch compliation. This may be their last album."
3,it sounded as it had a country beat to it.,"Except for All My Friends and Four Days, I thought I was listening to a country artist.I hope the rest of the album is different."
3,This Desert Life is a so-so record,"Being a Counting Crows fan since 1993 when they were playing in small clubs in South of Market in San Francisco, I was disappointed by this record. In their 2 previous efforts, not counting the self-indulgent ""Live on a wire"" release, they showed they had the ability to craft hooky, ""new"" sounds. This Desert Life sounds ordinary for the Crows. Maybe I'll need to hear it another 5 or 6 times more to really latch onto it. But overall from the first 3 or 4 listens, I'm about as enthusiastic about this record as I am about the new Van Morrison CD. Ho Hum."
4,"really fun, with violence","okay, this guy that does all this pyscho stuff goes around fighting for what ever side he is least mad at and basically is just an interesting character"
4,Great anime. Good for anyone tired of good guys.,"This movie is not for the faint of heart. Its about an escape that meets up with the Regular Army, and can kill anything. He searches the world for a good fight. If you enjoy violence, mayham, or even breasts, its a good film to watch."
5,Excellent historical book,"Understanding the title is the clue to the book. It is the name exclaimed by those who have shot down a plane which required documentation by sources other than the pilot. THe men and their stories are both fascinating and worthy of any war story. These men of the German Luftwaffe were truly heroes and men of steel. They served with valor and patriotism, although misplaced they worked harder than any other service in the military. They were only taken out of service by injury or death. This is unlike the American pilots who were for the most part taken out of flight service after a very few number of mission. The book is both a wonderful read and a view into lifes that should not be forgotten."
3,my review,"I WAS A P-38 fighter pilot ww2 15th A/F.i am curious about this book because i have read both versions, the paper back and the hard cover of Fighter aces of the luftwaffe. I am looking for the soft cover version of this book, is this book forsale here the soft or hard covered version?i have read both books, i found the soft covered one more historically accurate, and the later book(hard covered) to be more watered down to fact and more picture orientated."
2,Good drink but watch out!,"I have a HUGE problem with Orangina. Its a great drink and all the good stuff but it CUT me REAL bad when i tried to open the bottle. Do not assume that i am an amatuer at opening bottles.. I've lived in the same world as u have for the past 24 years but it sucks to have someone disregard the design and safety of a bottle so much so I got cut so bad. I have been really irritated since then, and everyone around me did the usual ""sue-em"" argument, but it costs $$. Anyway I hate the fact that the company doesnt care for something as basic and simple as this."
3,Too Many Pieces,"This kaleidoscope is fun at first, but has too many pieces that fall out and disappear or get destroyed. Buy a cheaper, simpler model. It will be used more because the kaleidoscope won't need to be assembled before it is used."
5,Cool Toy,"This Forde Flipping Action Obi-Wan action figure is a relly cool one, it is needed for any collection. However, the downside to this is that after a while the lightsaber in Obi's hand snaps off. Also, Obi-Wan doesn't always land on his feet. But it is still a pretty cool toy."
3,"Hard to flip, but figure is fine","On day one, we got Obi-Wan to land on his feet (same for the Dooku version), but never since. That gimmicky aspect was a disappointment. My son now uses the flipping piece as Dooku's speeder, and sometimes has the magnetic-footed figures stand on the circular platform for battles."
3,DOES NOT CHARGE!!!!!,"This thing is really good except it DOES NOT CHARGE!! The box says it charges and everything on the packaging says it charges the ipod, but it doesn't. It is a very nice for the money. THe sound is good for the price. I bought it for my child's room and it is very good for that. I would not use it at a party. It was difficult to get to work at first. We had to plug earplugs into it and remove them before the sound would come out."
5,speaker system for ishuffle,"I expected less when I ordered it because price was really low. I was amazed when I got it, because the quality is pretty good, sound quality is great, the only problem with it is that while playing the ishuffle doesn't recharge. The rest works just great!"
5,incredable,To begin with this unit weighs like a brick..guess that has to do with the speaker construction..even the zipper that close the case is impressive.and the sound outstanding
5,a must-have for anyone moving to boston,"this book is fantastic! i had 6 weeks to pack up and move from nyc to boston. this book was extraordinarily helpful. it has useful and accurate information about all of the vital things -- nieghborhood descriptions, utilities (including cable), government offices (e.g., driver's licenses, parking permits, passport office), recreation, restaurants, transportation, etc. it's wonderful. check it out before you move and you'll end up just where you want to be when you get here. or read it after you've already moved to find out more about what resources surround you. it definitely makes your move much easier, and continues to help you negotiate this place once you get here. it's well written and objective - a must-have."
1,"Horrible book, truly awful","I too have lived, travelled, and worked in Africa, specifically in some of the areas where Murphy passed through. There are good travel books, and there are good books about AIDS in Africa -- this is neither. Really, a truly lousy book."
4,Well worth reading,This is an unusually well-written and consistently interesting travel narrative. The author does come across as a tough old crow at times. (I can't imagine why she feels entitled to sneer at hikers who use the Lonely Planet guide.) But who else would have braved such an arduous journey in the first place? I can understand that her opinions about women's issues and the AIDS epidemic might be irritatingly opposed to yours. But isn't one of the points of traveling to meet people who aren't like ourselves?
3,Slightly disappointed in quality,"This broom fit as a replacement for the fireplace set we have. It seems to be doing the job, however the top row of wrapping thread immediately came unraveled. I am not able to get the proper tension to tighten it and re-tie it as it was. I think it will continue to do the job. We'll see."
3,ryan hickneys end of days music review,"i guess this soundtrack has got to be my favorite out of all of them, because it is the only one that has at least 4 songs that i like. the rest are ok."
3,"Great movies, strange price",This is a great collection of classic films. I have allbut one on DVD or Laserdisc.I am confused on the pricing. ..
5,Amazing!,Melbury Square gives a wonderful look into the life of a wealthy young girl in the turn of the century and how her road of reality is at times paved with Criso. I've read it twice and I am sure I'll read it again. It is truely amazing!
4,Yummy!,"A great deal on a hard to find flavor!However-- would not call it ""sour"" green apple-- just green apple, since there is no tartness to it.. but with added citric acid-- A shoe-in for Jolly Ranchers!"
3,Born of Shannon,"This movie was what it was advertised to be. A third rate B movie with the typical monster theme. However, the monster costumes were quite well done even if the storyline was a bit juvenile. The major saving grace for this movie was Shannon Zeller. Her lips alone were worth the purchase price of this B movie."
3,A refreshing break from the norm,"J-Pop can at best be world leading and ground breaking in its musical direction. Unfortunately, it can also be lifeless, thin and insulting to the ears. Misia sits closer to the former than the latter with a rich melodious voice let down only by below-par arangement on some of the tracks. Worth buying at the cover price but not a penny more."
4,Warriors:Navajo Code Talkers,"It was very informative and had wonderfulpictures. I never really understood what the CodeTalkers did, until I read the book."
5,book,"subject matter of historical interest, about Native Americans, easily ordered and shipped to 3rd party"
4,are you crazy!?,"Referring to the last review which said that the first Bass All-Stars had only one good song...are you CRAAAZY!? The first one was the BEST. ""My Boo"" by Ghosttown DJ's ""killed"" booty-shake. They just tried to recreate that hit with volumes 2 & 3. The first one was actual TRUE Booty-Shake!! I'm from Atlanta, I know better. Booty is RAP, not R&B!"
4,This album has tons of BaSS!,"It has tons of bass and my favorite bass song ""Love You Down"" by INOJ is on here. If you don't have this album, get it. I also recommend, Janet Jackson's ""The Velvet Rope""."
4,Much better than Vol I.,"This is a pretty good CD if you like So So Def Bass music. This one has about 5 or 6 good tracks, unlike the first one which only had 1. My favorites are InoJ - Love You Down, Lathun - Freak It, and Virgo - Apple Pie. The same beats as usual, but better vocals."
1,"He swings, he whiffs...","While the topic of Durocher's Cubs is certainly a fascinating one, David Claerbaut totally dropped the ball. The writing is dull, the insights are not particularly insightful, and he constantly breaks the flow of the narrative with statistical analysis that borders on overkill. This is the first baseball book in ages that I haven't felt compelled to finish -- and I'm a Cubs fan!"
1,Worst Book I've Ever Read,"I grew up as a Cub fan. I've changed loyalties since the late 70's, but the Cubs of Claerbaut are still my heroes. This book, however, is the WORST I've ever read on any topic. As a history teacher of 31 years I've read somewhere in the vicinity of 1,000 books. Never have I seen a tome that has had as many incorrect spellings, botched facts, inane analyses, and poor writing style. I now regret having had my wife lovingly dish out my hard-earned money for this literary trainwreck. She could have gotten me a highlight tape of the '69 Mets and it would not aggravate me as much.Here and now I'm warning any Bruin-backer (as Claerbaut would label him) to save his cash, keep an eye on ESPN CLassic, and have the patience to wait until Leo's era in Chicago is profiled.After all, if a Cub fan has been waiting 57 years for another pennant, he can bide his time a little longer for a better book."
4,Durocher's Cubs,"Excellent, I enjoyed it every much. If you lived through Durocher's Cubs you'll love it. Brought back a lot of memories. It tells the complete story of the team, not just 69. It also contains the best analysis yet of why they didn't win a title and why we loved those players so much. The 67 run to first place, Adolpho Phillips, Willie Smith's home run, Holtzman's no hitter, Pepitone, Pappas, the clubhouse explosion, it's all here."
2,Durocher's Cubs makes its point OVER AND OVER AND OVER,"Durocher's Cubs is a pretty good book analyzing the Cubs best years. However at times I felt like I was reading a media guide and not a book. He proves time and time again that Durocher was not the same manager as he was compared to his years in Brooklyn by giving us countless game situations. He goes into too much detail about Durocher's childhood and demons that he faced. All of us have our demons but the author treats these as the only reason the Cubs couldn't win. If I remember correctly, Durocher never threw a pitch, swung a bat, or threw a ball that year. For a better Cub history book, read The Chicago Cubs: The Million to One team."
2,"Humorous, factual, and entertaining.","As a former Carbon County resident who is familiar with all the people mentioned in this book, I know the author did a super job of telling their story. The author paints vivids pictures of each characture and relates their stories in an easy to read style. Great gift for anyone who loves the lore of Wyoming."
3,The Buccaneers -- completed by Marion Mainwarning 1993,"It's a shame that Marion Mainwaring took such liberties with Edith Whartons style The closing of her stories was always in another direction. And usually not a happy one.Edith had she lived, I believe would have had the Brief Love Affair between Guy and Annibel end at Laura Testvalleys family home with a sad but brief good-bye; Annibel to Amrerica and Guy to where ever. Laura succeeds in achieving a safe harbour for her well deserved ending. And the Duke is still the Duke and that's bad enough. This ending was unfitting a good storyteller as Edith Wharton was."
1,Too boring to keep reading,"This book never took off, it introduced too many characters and there was little to no depth. I stopped 1/3 of the way through."
1,Great Promise With Plenty of Problems,"This book is a great resource for those interested in architecture in Los Angeles, but it has MAJOR problems. Not only are the maps inaccurate about 50% of the time (wrong intersection, wrong place along a street, or just plain wrong), but I have also found several listings for which the street address is wrong, including one for which the wrong street name is given. I have also searched for buildings only to realize that they have been demolished. While Los Angeles has gone through a lot of changes in the last few years, several of the buildings on question were demolished before this edition came out. So if you going to use this book to discover architecturally significant buildings, bring along a good map, a great sense of direction and allow plenty of time, you're going to need all of those to overcome the mistakes made by the authors."
3,Great handling but way too heavy!,"I have used this stroller for the past 8 months (since my son was born). For the first 6 months, we used it as a travel system with the Companion infant seat, and I loved it. It handled so well, was surprisingly light to push, and was easy to use. However, when we began to use the stroller with the seat that comes with it, I was extremely disappointed! The stroller takes up an enormous amount of room in the trunk of my SUV and it's so incredibly heavy that I can barely lift it in and out of the car. Also, the sunshade is virtually nonexistent. I have recently replaced it with a Joovy Kooper (which I love!) to keep in my car, and will be keeping the Vigour at home for walks around our neighborhood."
5,BEST. STROLLER. EVER.,"We LOVE our Vigour. It was a little on the pricey side, but it is worth every dollar. You definitely get what you pay for in this stroller.It unfolds/folds with ease and turns on a dime. You can push it with one hand. It also has awesome suspension. We use it with our ""Companion"" car seat all of the time. We are really happy with the setup.This stroller is highly recommended."
4,Britax Vigour Stroller Blue,"Great wheels, it turns around great. The seat moves up & down~great feature if baby either sleeps or sits. The only thing that I don't like is that the strap to buckle child is a thin black strap thinner than a belt. I like the straps to the other traditional strollers, but everything else is wonderful. It also doesn't come with cup holders."
3,Good stroller and support after the fact has been excellent,"We purchased the stroller 9 months ago. We loved it, but on our first plane trip a plastic part that holds the handle to the base broke. The stroller was still operable, but on the next plane trip the other part broke. Now it's inoperable. We contacted Britax and there customer service took care of the situation by sending us a new stroller to replace this one without charge. We love the stroller and based on their response this is product issue, they have very, very happy customer and advocate for their company.Also, for some reason I could not change my original rating once I submitted my comments. I rate this product and company a 5."
3,Works as it should,"This works as it should, and yet I think they made it pretty cheaply, the plastic can crack easily and here and there, one of the port holes is not working but mostly they do work, its great for helping extend spaces due to your laptop's lack of enough usb ports."
1,Not a direct replacement.,"I bought this to replace a corroded OEM aluminum water neck on my 1991 F250 5.0L. However, after installing it, I went to hook up the overflow tube, but the nipple on this water neck was too small. I ended up glass beading my OEM water neck and putting it back in. It looked decent, but was useless."
4,Waves of pleasant music for the mind and spirit,"Melodies of the mind and spirit flow in waves. Your heart is transported somewhere out beyond the solar system. I recommend this music to anyone wanting to reach a state of tranquil reflection. If you want a heart-pounding beat or the jangle of electronic guitars, you won't find it in this album. But if you crave a place to mellow your world, tune in and fly away."
3,Solid Work,"This is a perfectly good body of work, however, for meditation, I need sustained sound. The fact that the songs end so often is off-putting and interupts the flow that one is trying to achieve while listening to music of this type. If the songs blended into one another, it would be a more invaluable addition to my collection."
5,Highly Recommended for Relaxation & Meditation . . .,"Wonderful for relaxation and meditation - highly recommended! Steven Halpern's genius is in creating music to set moods and elicit relaxation. Inner Peace is just such a piece! Music to set a quiet, relaxing background for deeply peaceful contemplation and meditation, or just for quiet, gentle introspection . . . Gary L. Flegal, Ph.D., Professional Stress Management Services."
3,There is better Ambient/ environmental meditation music,"This particular title is very good if you do not know what you are looking for. I reccomend personally for you to search for a more qualified artist then rely on the arbitrary compilation of a marketing album.I reccomend checking out Aphex Twin ""Selected Ambient Works"", or Tangerine dream, or Enya if you prefer vocals."
3,"Zen CAPITALISM, kinda &#65533; MOLE or d'ya want more?","Would someone in California hold this Halpern to n oak tree or the like?NEW TITLE with the same old songs renamed!!!!You huge fan of this Halpern (like me) just do that: BUY his five first issues, and then you'll own his COMPLETE WORK.And following the Halpern Way of Working Hard, author you own CD's mixing his songs and renaming them at your choice...You'll see how many Halperns a swindle can produce!Enjoy!"
3,Inner Peace CD,"I am returning the cd... it skips. The CD content is great, the quality of the disc is the problem."
2,disappointed,"Apparently I must be the only one in the reviews that is not impressed with this CD. It's only my opinion but it didn't do anything for me. It sounds too synthesized, old 80's style of new age music. It did not flow either, sudden stops to the tracks were not conducive to meditation. There are much better artists out there, Deuter being one of them."
3,Inner Peace,It was alright. The sounds did not resonate with me too well. Could not get to a state of balance.
4,inner peace,"Listening to this is a very calming experience. I listen to a lot of Halpern and this is just perfect. Great to put on for an evening at home in front of the fire, or out on the beach watching the waves roll in."
2,Kindle cost over paper back too high,"First I was hesitant to order this book due to the fact they are now charging more the the Kindle version than the paper back book, but thought it might be worth it after reviewing the recommendations. Not the greatest book and certainly not worth paying more for the Kindle version over the paper back."
1,Not about a dog,"I'm sorry, but this is not all that funny and it's not about a dog. If you want funny, read something by Bill Bryson, a funny man who also writes about real life. Anybody can write a silly story about nothing much."
4,Wacky story,"I love off beat humor and certainly found it here. This guy (the protagonist) is certainly a patient fellow who keeps going in the face of good reason. Of course, there would have been no story if he had acted rationally."
3,"I like it, sort of","This is an eccentric book about eccentric people. The story meanders along at a gentle pace, so gentle that it barely misses being pointless. There are sections that are quite funny, and others in which the central character's clueless state becomes increasingly frustrating. It may be that it is difficult to write a story in which the central character's role is to be a foil for a bunch of oddballs, and not a very active foil at that. Am I glad I read it? Yes, it's a different kind of book. Will I read it again? Oh no.Richard Knight"
4,A bit of nonsense,"This is a nonsense tale,but it has some great lines. A number of laugh out loud passages. It is a great mood booster."
2,Aimless and Rambling with some redeeming qualities,"Left aglow by ""True Grit"" I soon followed with ""The Dog of the South"" The first half of the book had a lot of promise while Ray Midge made his way to British Honduras but became bogged down with numerous similar rambling characters and pointless dialogue. I was left feeling that most of the individuals needed way to much to relate their less than interesting and extensive backgrounds to Midge. The dialogues and realizations ostensibly from a sense the character is either inebriated, drug imbued or just plain dumb. The non-sensical aspect of some of the conversations are maddening.This may have made sense relating to this time period that brings about a curiosity in the reader that soon wears off, It just gets hard to deal unless you like to swim around in a philosophical molasses of individuals that gets you there eventually."
2,Didn't know what I was supposed to be appreciating,"I think I would've enjoyed this book more if I had known that I was supposed to be appreciating the goofy characters that Ray Midge encounters and not necessarily Midge's attempt to track down his cheating wife. The point of the book is certainly not the plot. Make sure you understand this before you start reading it.The first half of the book, when Midge is hot on the trail to Mexico in pursuit of his wife and her boyfriend, was my favorite part of the book. Probably because it is before he gets bogged down in Belize. At that point, the book transitions from plot-based to character-based. Since I mistakenly got too focused on the plot, the book stagnated and became boring.Since I had already read True Grit, which was plot-based all the way through, I was expecting more of the same. As such, I was disappointed with this one. Maybe it will take reading it again to fully appreciate its strengths. Until then, it was fairly ""meh"" to me."
4,Memorable,"Wickedly funny and wildly entertaining, ""The Dog of the South"" is a book to be read, enjoyed, and forever cherished."
2,I guess I just don't get it.,"I certainly agree that Portis is a talented writer, but I just didn't find him all that funny. Perhaps I'm missing something, but I thought that the characters were strange enough, not amusing, just strange. I was frustrated by the characters and the world that they inhabited. I forced myself to finish the book and I was rewarded by the one funny line in the whole book, which comes at the very end of the novel."
3,"Great story, lousy ending","I found the premise of this storyline refreshing and different. A talk show hosts gets a phone call from a man claiming he wants to come on the show, talk about a murder he is planning, then return after the murder takes place and talk about how it went and what he felt as he did it. Things go down hill from there.The story was fast paced and interesting, but somewhere 2/3 through the book, the detective investigating the case suddenly figures out who it is and confronts him, this doesn't stop the murders from taking place and you are left wondering why he wasn't arrested on the spot and exactly why he does what he does. There just wasn't enough thought put into this part of the plot. It ruined an otherwise great read.While this book is not a waste of time to read, just understand that it's not going to be a ""bowl you over"" kind of book."
2,Worst ending ever.,"I don't mind if a movie/book ends and makes you think about the conclusions, sometimes it can be fun.However, this book leaves you with not only ""no conclusion"" but with the fact that, even if there is a sequel, you won't want to read it."
1,Hated it!,"I know a lot of people liked this book but I found it boring. I didn't like the characters, didn't like the story. Waste of time! Don't bother!"
3,Not The Worst I've Read,"I picked up this book before there were any reviews. A few days into it, the first review appeared on here. I was very discouraged after seeing it (however, I wasn't crazy about the quality of the review either). Next, the 3 reviews from the same person came along that gave it only 1 star each time... not fair. I'm glad I finished the book despite the bad breaks it got. I have to admit, it was not the most captivating mystery I've ever read but certainly not the worst. The biggest complaint I might have is that many times throughout, it is not believable. You start getting ""into it"" and something is thrown at you that reminds you that it is fiction... almost a little ""fairly tale-ish"". Things just always seemed to work out nice and neat. It is a pretty straight forward read though (easy to follow) and moderately entertaining."
2,fish or fowl?,"The original Sweetwater stood out as a rock-fusion band without a guitarist, the only one of their era. This reunion gig has taken on a guitarist with a heavy, dominating sound, so it doesn't really sound like Sweetwater. Nancy Nevins's new, post car-crash voice isn't really suited for all of the old Sweetwater stuff, and especially not for shouting over a heavy fuzz guitar, but she does manage a few moments of magic, especially on the new-material ""Heroes and Ladies."""
