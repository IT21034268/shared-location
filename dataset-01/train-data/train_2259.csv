2,Great Details - Disappointing Book,"Although I was very impressed with the details in this book and learned a lot, as a book I found it very slow reading that did not flow well. I have great respect for the Special Forces and admire what they do but Moore's style of writing made you think he was going far overboard and exaggerating too much. Even if everything Moore says is 100% true, his way of writing this made you tend not to fully believe him.If I was related to a member of the Special Forces, I would probably feel this was a tremendous book."
2,Book Review,"The book gives the reader a general understanding of how Army Special Forces were used in Afghanistan and a general understanding of the politics in the region. However, it is not very detailed. Depictions of battles and operations are very skim. No detailed descriptions of how units were deployed or maneuvered on the field. Because everything in the book is so general, many of the vignettes become repetitive and boring. Not for the military historian or for military personnel. This book seems oriented more towards the general public."
1,To much information,"This could be a good book. However, to give out actual names of the Special Forces members that participated in these events is WRONG. These guys have families that could be in potential danger from giving out information that Robin Moore has. These guys could be in danger fighting in any part of the middle east, everyone that buys this book now has a name and rank to go along with a face. So, everytime you read this book, think about the lives that Robin Moore has put in danger everytime someone reads this book."
3,Not bad,Very cheerleaderish with the author's gushing over the green berets. I felt the slamming of the air force's combat controlers was unnessessary given the reasons provided. Sone of claims that Moore made of the SF isn't the same as what I've read in other books. Dialoge is really corny but from a history perspective the book was good and was interesting enough to read.
4,Somewhat like a non-fiction Tom Clancey novel,"This is a good look into what the news media would never have been able to report. It gives insight to the Special Ops folks and their world. You will likely come away with more respect for these elite, unconventional warriors of our armed services and also some understanding of the Afghanistan culture."
5,"""THE SPIRIT OF AMERICA""","This is one of the top ten books I have ever read and embodies ""the Spirit of America""! I couldn't put it down and read it in three days only because I have to ""make a living"". Every chapter with each ""team's"" mission captivated me and made me feel as if I was with them, which I was in spirit if not in body. I laughed, cried and was simply amazed at the courage, devotion and sacrifice each and every individual participant, including the families, contributed and endured on a 24 hour basis. Through his writing, Robin Moore reminded me how proud and lucky I am to be an American. Had I the chance to ""live my life again"", my goal would have been nothing less, and nothing more, than to be a Green Beret!"
1,Complete fiction!!!,"Poor Robin Moore was completely discredited by this POS called ""Jack"" Idema, whom by the way, was a total fraud, according to those who knew him. ""Jack"" Idema was basically out to make himself look like a hero and basically abused the trust of Mr. Robin Moore. This book is nothing but one egotistic nut job (""Jack"" Idema)'s make believe fiction and readers should not waste their time reading it unless they want to read fiction of what a nut job (""Jack"" Idema) think happen during the early year of the Afghan war.Robin Moore is a good man and his book about the US Army Special Forces was a great book, I am just sorry that his good name got tarnished by a POS called ""Jack"" Idema."
1,Don't waste your time,"Yes, I did waste about $5.00 for a used copy plus shipping, but NO I did'nt waste my time reading this distorted account of one ""so called"" hero's brave exploits in Afghanistan. Before you buy this book know that author Robin Moore disavowed his involvement with the book when he finally learned that co-author/hero Jack Idema was a con man who had never served in the Special Forces. If you would like to know about the main character Jack Idema check him on Wikpedia.com."
1,Shameful,"I feel bad for the author as he has fallen for a convicted con-man. This lowlife took advantage of Mr. Moore in an atempt to gain fame and fortune. Well I for one hope Mr. Idema gets what is comming to him.....infamy and missfortune. I hope this does not diminish in any way the great deeds that the brave SF soldiers did. These men are heroes and should be thought of that way, just not the one mentioned in this book."
2,Misleading...,"The author in typical arrogant fashion said that the Green Berets succeeding in defeating Al-Qaeda, Taliban forces in just a few months. He contrasts this to Soviets who could not defeat Afghanistan in 10 years of warfare. What author fails to know is that Soviets did not have support of majority of Afghan people while the US knew that the general Afghan populace detested the Taliban. The US also had their gladiators- the Northern Alliance and other forces to do the majority of fighting and dying for them plus overwhelming power in air. Their foes did not get constant weapons supplies either. Hence this comparison with the Soviets is misleading."
3,Bush Failed at getting Osama Bin Laden,More than 3 years after Osama Bin Laden and his gang attacked us we still are having to deal with his threats. We need a president who will not lose sight of our true enemies. After losing so many of our young men and women and spending so much money we are no safer than we were on 9/11!What was the point?Please vote for John Kerry.
2,Pure propaganda,"I bought this book more of as a gag than for anything else. As somebody who was a part of TASK FORCE DAGGER I can say that there are many, many factual errors in this book. About the only thing accurate is the author's unconditional support of the ODAs. If you elect to read this book be advised that it is not a good history of TF Dagger or SOF operations in Afghanistan. It is not objective in the least. Take it with a grain of salt. His contempt for all of the other SOF units, including AFSOC and NAVSPECWARCOM assets, tarnishes the book. Maybe somebody will write a credible book detailing the history of TF DAGGER down the road. I know the guys in my unit laugh when this book is brought up!"
1,Fiction!,"Attention potential buyer: This book is a work of fiction based on the events that happened in Afghanistan. My Special Forces team recently obtained a copy of this book and want to ensure that the public knows the details of battles, specifically incidents involving ""Jack"" are the imaginary ramblings of an imposter. Due to government restrictions on soldiers, a non fiction work will have to wait declassification. In the meantime, buy this book with the knowledge that what you are reading is very innacurate. My detachment (A-Team) includes veterans of the fighting at Kandahar, Mazar-e-Sharif, and Tora Bora. We feel that what we have accomplished in Afghanistan has been demeaned by this misrepresentation of the truth."
4,Looking for fleeting glimmers of truth? Read this book.,"This book will aid in your search for information that is not forth coming from any other source that I've read as of yet. If you are trying to glean information you also know that the material you will have to read may not be pulitzer prize stuff. So I would ignore the literary critics, see through their criticism's. They don't want you to know about or believe how effective we can be using Spec Op Forces correctly. This arguement has been going on for over 50 years! Conventional Force lobbyist's were trying to politicize this debate in the press, they showed how far they will go with our soldiers lives, our national goals, just to keep from sharing their big budgets for large conventional forces."
1,The Distortion of History,"This book should be read for entertainment and not as a history of the war in Afghanistan. It was clearly written from behind the lines and based on the select testimony of SF soildiers returning from battle. Anyone with experience in this war will be able to pick out the predjudices and axes being grinded by the author and his sources. However, the critical flaw is not one of the author's point-of-view but the simple factual errors which fill the pages. A sad case of the misinformed spreading the word as if it was gospel."
5,No Surprise,The heads arrived ahead of schedule and were well packaged.They slipped into my old razor easily and now my old razor is cutting the way it did when it was new.If these heads last as long as the first set they will outlast me.Good service. Good product.
5,Excellent shave,"I got my Norelco shaver used, and this is the first time I've used new heads. Almost as good as a razor!"
3,There is a but...,"The replacement heads were in excellent condition. However, they were pretty expensive...almost half the cost of a new shaver."
4,Like new - and good for the environment,"Quick, cheap and simple. The hard part was making sure I was ordering the right part (thanks to the Norelco website it wasn't too difficult). Replacing the heads made sense to me - why toss out a perfectly good shaver if the unit can be made to work as if new with the purchase of new heads? The razor works great with the new blades. They were simple to install. Note: it took longer to open the industrial strength packaging than it did to install the heads.There are three complaints: 1) choosing the right replacement should be easier, 2) there was a good deal of wasted packaging, and 3) the cost of the heads was over half the cost of an new razor. But all-in-all a good choice."
5,Air and Heads,"The pack of Norelco replacement heads arrived quickly. The product package is about 3""x5""x.2"". It was shipped in an Amazon book box approximately 12"" x10""x4"". I'm sure the mailman wondered if anything was in the box.About the product, they sure are expensive. But the alternative is to buy a new shaver, at 3X the cost of the heads. Oh well, they should be good for a year or more."
3,I enjoy this product but they are to expensive!,"I enjoy my Norelco shaver, and I can appreciate the precisionneeded to produce such a good product, but I have to say,that I feel that these blades/heads should last a heck of a lot longer,OR they should be a LOT cheaper!Sorry to say, but I hope a company will start making a generic versionof this product and sell them at a reasonable price, and cash in!"
4,replacement blades,"Installation was easy - everything worked fine. 'still not as close as a razor, but not expected to be."
5,Just what we needed.,My husband's Norelco razor just didn't work as it should so I searched for a new head for it and Bingo -- Amazon.com had just what we needed. In no time all was well and we were completely satisfied.
3,Fake reviews!,"Someone, the publicist, Morrison, the subject herself, a fan or a relative is posting 5-star fake reviews here and having any negative reviews pulled. Shame.Now we get an insight into what Tony Hendra possibly has had to deal with."
4,Engaging story,"About: Biography of daughter of comedian Tony Hendra (whom I had never heard of)Pros: Considering I had never heard of her before I read this book, it was pretty awesome. Good story, lots of bad family dynamics.Cons: Stupid title, ugly coverGrade: A-"
4,"Very honest, I feel for her...","One can't help feeling sympathy for the very open and vulnerable child (and woman she became) who wrote thisbook. I sensed her sweetness and tenderness on every page, and can't believe the insensitivity - the cruelty - displayed by her rather disgusting father. He seems to be a massive egotist, with little remorse for what he put his family through. The book was poorly written and edited in parts, but I wanted to keep reading it because I liked Ms. Hendra very much and felt I kind of owed it to her to follow her story to the end. I'm glad I did. She's got guts, and everyone who's been sexually (and emotionally) abused as she was, needs these kinds of true stories."
1,Not enough,The individual items are tiny and the flavor is fine but not sensational. Overpriced for what one gets.
5,What a value!,"In shopping for in-ceiling speakers for our Sonos system, I came across HiFi Works. Since their parent company (Sonance) did high custom installation speakers, I figured I would give them a shot. We installed this speaker pair in our bedroom. They sound great for the price. Even the bass response was better than I had expected.Installation was a snap. Cut the holes (I used a spin saw with a circle attachment--it cut a perfect hole), ran the wire, connected the speakers, placed them and tighten the screws, replaced the grills. Done.I plan on putting these speakers in the kitchen, guest room, garage, and dining room; the 5.25 inch speakers in the bathroom; four 8 inch speakers in the living; and their rock speakers in the backyard."
1,not the size they say they are,"cut out is actually 7 5/8"", not the 8.15"" listed in the description. Since I needed to fill an existing cut out, this difference was unacceptable."
3,Not impressed but pleased,"I've had my vacuum a couple of months now and so far have had no promblems. It has awsome suction. For the money it is a good vacuum. You would expect to pay the same for a hoover or dirt devil ect...However I did expect it to be made out of better material than it was. The rear wheels are to small as well.Great for bare floors, Hard to push on shag. However for the money it is comparable to anything else thats out there with probably more suction."
5,GREAT FOR THE PRICE,I have an alaskan malamute that sheds 24/7 and is an indoor dog this vacuum is 3 + years old and still going strong we use it every day ( I am not kidding ) No other vacuum has lasted over a year with the same use. I have used Hoover and Eureka and spent twice the price.
4,Worth the Money,"I have 3 dogs, 2 cats and 2 kids that are good at making a mess. This vacuum has been up to the tasks of cleaning up after them. With my old vacuum it looked like I never vacuumed, now you can tell when I have used the Bosch. I don't think it is difficult to push, I like the fact that it has 2 motors, one for the brush and one for the suction, it allows me to clean my wood floors and tile with damaging them with the brush. The only reason I didn't rate this 5 out of 5 is that the attached hose is a bit cumbersome to use and is not as long as i would like it to be.Pros- Great cleaning power, even picks up pet hair.- Easy to empty bagless container.- Retractable cord.Cons- Hose attachment cumbersome.- Kind of heavy."
2,broken,"It worked incredibly well for the first 12 months, has plenty of suction power and cleans better than any vacuum i've owned before, but the motor doesn't roll anymore and it's been over a year since i've owned it. It doesn't pick anything up anymore."
2,Yo-oh-heave-ho,"Bagless is a great idea (although you'll empty the tube more than change the bag in a conventional vacuum) and I love good design (which this promised to be), but am very disappointed with the Bosch Cyclone. Works fine over hard floors but drags so much on carpet (the wheels are NOT powered- this is all push and pull) that I switch to an ancient Hoover which does the job much better and doesn't leave me exhausted and my back aching. Contrary to claims, this is a real heavyweight. The retractable cord mechanism also broke within three months (wants to suck the cord back in, won't leave it out). So much for German design. Go American or Japanese."
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this vacuum a little over a year ago to replace an ancient Hoover wind tunnel. I spent hours reviewing different models and decided on the Bosch. I am soooooooo disappointed in this vacuum.From day one it was a bear to push, but I thought well, I will get used to it, it's good exercise. But then I found the hose and attachments are so difficult to use and IMO, useless. The HEPA filter clogged up quickly, and when I replaced it, what a HUGE mess.Another disadvantage is there is no way to manually adjust the height. The plastic strip on the bottom of vacuum cracked and broke off after a few months, and now the beater bar refuses to turn. It's now going in the garbage, it's not worth fixing.BTW, I have no pets or kids, and do not ""abuse"" my vacuums.Like I said, I am so disappointed in this vacuum, it's been nothing but a waste of time and money."
1,Discrepancy between the ad price and the real price,"I was surprised by finding that the ad price for this item ($165+$0 shipping+$0tax) has been transformed into $195. That's , at least, strange, if not a deceiving information"
1,ALL MY CARTRIDGES WERE BROKEN!!!!,ALL OF MY CARTRIDGES WERE BROKEN!I didn't check them when I received them so when I needed to replace the one that ran out I had NONE & now I have to RUSH order some so I don't miss my faxes!
3,Average Social Phobia/Shyness Book,"I have read several books on shyness/social phobia, and this book is about the same as the others. It is a good book if you have never read a book on social phobia/shyness. I was hoping there would be more detail on being social (helping in conversations & introductions); however, this books preaches what the others did...relaxing & visualizing. Like I said, it is a good book if you haven't read one on this subject but just about the same as the other social phobia/shyness books."
3,For Stokowski fans only,"First of all, I like Stokowski, which is why I bought this hybrid SACD. The performance is fine and the sound is great. Why only 3 stars? I am being very generous in giving it 3 stars and I do so only because the great Stokowski was involved.I'm sorry, but the music is very mediocre. I think this is the worst Stravinsky score I've ever heard. Stoki may be giving it his all, but a well conducted lousy score is still a lousy score. I wasn't fond of the narrators either. It really wouldn't be possible for the narration to be any hammier than it is on this recording. This just didn't work for me at all. I can recommend it only to Stokowski completists or people who are already familiar with this Stravinsky work and like it. If not for Stokowski's involvement and the excellence of the recording, I'd give it 1 star purely on artistic merit."
5,"A review of plants best suitable for California gardens, covering cultivation, landscape design usage, water needs, and more","If you're a California gardener you can't be without CALIFORNIA NATIVE PLANTS FOR THE GARDEN, which is deserving of ongoing recommendation as one of the most comprehensive guides on the subject we've seen. Color photos pack a comprehensive review of plants best suitable for California gardens, covering cultivation, landscape design usage, water needs, and more. From pruning requirements to common diseases and insect problems, plants in CALIFORNIA NATIVE PLANTS FOR THE GARDEN are all thoroughly detailed.Diane C. Donovan, EditorCalifornia Bookwatch"
5,Irresistible!,"My husband and I are gardeners, and we tend to gravitate towards California natives . . . and this book offers us everything we need. It's a must for every gardener, whether a professional or just your everyday backyard enthusiast. Kudos to the staff at Cachuma Press and the authors for bringing us this spectacular, yet down-to-earth (like get in the dirt, dig, plant, and enjoy!) book."
5,The Best Out There,Excellent guidance for this novice switching to all California Native plants in my re-done front yard.
5,Boy! I miss California so much!,Native California plants have their own way of showing natutual beauty. This book catches the spirit of these plants. Would like to see more closeup pictures so that I can learn to identify them.
2,Porter with a backup vocal band,"If you enjoy Porter Wagoner get this CD. The Blackwoods are only Porter's backup vocal band; not an equal partner. Porter has the ability to overpower cheerful Southern Gospel with mournful country tunes.'Thirty Pieces of Silver would have been better served with another tune. Throughout the song I thought of my grade school days singing 'On Top of Old Smokey'. Perhaps that tune was OK for the time it was recorded.[....] states that More Grand Old Gospel was awarded the Grammy Best Gospel Performance in 1967. The musicians were James Blackwood Sr., Cecil Blackwood, Bill Shaw, John Hall, Dave Weston - pianist."
2,"Not like the ""old time"" Blackwood Brothers",Sound is quite different from Blackwood Brothers albums of 25 years ago. I was rather disappointed.
4,More Grand Old Gospel,It had a song that my father always loved I hadn't been able to find it. and I always liked Porter Wagner.
3,Don't be Fooled,"Don't be fooled by the rave reviews. I got this vac for my car, and it doesn't pick alot of the dirt. Sure, this vaccum is great for $20, but it doesn't have good suction. If you have the money, and want a good clean then look somewhere else. However, if your wallet is tight then this might be the best purchase for you."
2,hard to find filters,I like the vacuum well enough but it's been a headache to find a filter replacement. You can call 888-678-7278 to buy them at $2.30 ea. plus $7.95 s/h + tax. They'll let you buy as many filters for the same shipping charge.
2,GET A REPLACEMENT FILTER,"I wish I'd read the previous review before I bought! I loved this in the beginning, but a well meaning friend threw away the filter and since we live in Hawaii the only way to get a new one was ON-LINE! It would take months and cost more in shipping than the actual filter.I bought another one (similar model) and made sure the local Wal-mart had replacement filters. Not my usual experience with Black and Decker! Their products are usually MUCH better."
3,great but!!!!!!!,"I love my wet/dry vac. does a wonderful job, but i must add a WARNING: If you see the filters buy them right away. I have been looking for over a month for the filters no one carries them. I have checked the company sight and could not get into the online ordering area, and all the stores listed as carriers of the filter do not have them and many said they have never carried them.The wet dry vac is great if only I could use it again."
4,Love it but......,"can't even find a filter at B&D; online tonight, unless the replacements don't look the same!Other than that, it works great for what I bought it for. I only have one carpet left and this works wonders on the cat hairs that gather in the corners."
5,Love these!,They taste amazing and they arrived quickly with no damage to the packaging. I get a box of these for my mom for Christmas every year now.
2,Good book if you can figure out his way of writing,"I shall provide a sample of Dr. Restak's writing. See ifyou can figure it out. No, there are no typo's in mytranscription below - I checked it.""While there are facts and figures enough here to keep happythose for whom learing facts about something is a form ofmastery, there are, at the same time, matters to ponder aboutwhich, I trust, will interest those readers who will agree withThomas Merton that on occassion, ""the demand for explanation isdue to the desire to be rid of mystery"".""Come on Dr. Restak - this is ridiculous. Please hire aprofessional writer and fix your prose. Else this is a deadbook. I offer my services."
5,Must have for anyone who looks to dress well,"If you are not sure or just do not have a clue as to how to dress yourself, YOU HAVE TO GET THIS!! Do not let the cover fool you, I know it is outdated, but the information inside is not. IT will help a ton in buying the right clothes for your body, but also for your personality and show you how to put things together so you look polished. I know that image consultants have this book, all their principles mimic everything that is written in here. A must have for everyone!!"
1,If you are a Man don't buy it!,"Unfortunatly in it's description it does not state that is targeted to women... all the drawings, clothes and etc... are for women... yes you can grasp the concepts but it would be better to have exemples and descriptions intended to men as well."
5,"Luther, I'll Never Let You Go","I have been reading the reviews of this CD ""Never Let Me Go"" by other listeners. I view this wonderful Project by Luther (aka Uncle Ronnie) as was those recordings made by Frank Sinatra when although some called them his 'lean' years, Frank's voice was richer and had a certain maturity about it...and that's how I hear these songs and the talent in Luther's writing. To me, these songs speak of a mature, enduring love. I also LOVE the picture of Luther on the front of the CD...there's a wonder and invitation in his eyes as he looks directly into the lens of the camera as if to speak the title track. (...never let me go..) 'Heaven knows' I will also love your sultry voice Luther, and miss you too."
2,Picture above is misleading!,"Be warned if you buy this that it is not as small as it looks! I bought one, expecting a case that i could put in my backpack...however when it arrived it actually holds FOUR cds on each 'page'...its very large. I had to send it back. Overall, the cdprojects cases are great though."
1,DISGRACE!!!,No one besides McGuinn should ever be allowed to cover a Dylan tune! Nobody else can capture the spirit of the song and do it justice. No wonder Dylan was so uncomfortable at the end that he gave a lousy performance!!!
5,"If you like Dylan, you'll love this!","Growing up being a big fan of the Bryds, how could one not enjoy listening to Dylan played by some of the worlds finest musicians. There has never been a better rendition of Mr. Tambourine Man. My Back Pages with Bob Dylan, Roger McGuinn, Tom Petty, Neil Young, Eric Clapton, George Harrison is also something special.Stevie Wonder gets carried away with his intro to Blowing in the Wind, but fast forward 2&1/2 minutes and you will miss the only misery of this CD. The end of this double CD has Dylan singing. It makes you appreciate how special his music is when sung by these top performers. It also shows off what Dylan does best - song writing.Wanna hear Dylan with an Irish accent? Buy the CD. I can't think of a better way to spend 2 hours in the car. I own over 500 CD's and this one is my favorite."
3,Just not the same,"I love every song done on this album......but no one pulls off Bob's songs better than Bob himself. There were some high points, Neil Young, The Band, Tom Petty. But the all time high point was Bob, singing It's Alright Ma... and Girl From the North Country. Bob wrote 'em, and only Bob truly knows how to sing 'em.But, if you don't like Bob's voice, then this is by all means an album for you to buy."
3,Bob Dylan 30th Anniversary Concert,"I bought this cd for the fabulous Eric Clapton cut. This is one of EC's best ever. It's worth the price of the set. The rest is so,so."
3,"lou reed, willie nelson, neil young",My friend Pete was a big Tom Petty fan. He borrowed this album and loved it. He would probably have given it 4 or 5 stars. But he never liked Dylan on the whole. It's not a matter of the material but the performer here that will appeal. And here I just bought it for the Neil Young set.
3,3 and a half stars,"Not bad. The definite highlight is ""My Back Pages"" where Harrison, Clapton, Dylan, Neil Young, McGuinn, and Petty all take a verse. McGuinn sounds even better on ""Mr Tamborine Man"" and overall a great effort by all the artist covering some well known and not so well know Dylan songs."
4,Fascinating,"""Archie M"" seems to have rather missed the point of this album, when he complains that many of the song versions here ""have no resemblence to the original"". That's the WHOLE IDEA OF INTERPRETATIONS! He seems to like McGuinn's ""Tambourine Man"" because it sounds just like the record. What's the point of that?Sure, nobody is going to like *everything* here (I could do without Mellencamp for example), but there are a few absolute stormers - Lou Reed, Richie Havens, Tracy Chapman, and - especially - Eric Clapton. I'd go so far as to say that EC's performance of ""Don't Think Twice"" is not only the high point of this show, it's the high point of his *career*. If you're a fan of the ""Layla"" album, and have been disappointed with the mostly soporific stuff he's done since then, listen to this - it's *blistering* - right up there with ""Have You Ever Loved A Woman"". Great, great music."
3,An excellent variety of interpretations,"Dylan's songs have been interpreted by everyone from Trini Lopez to Jimi Hendrix, & so goes this excellent collection of legendary artists. My personal favs were Clapton, Winters, Johnny Cash, & Tom Petty. I was less impressed with John Cougar Mellencamp Smith Jones (or whatever he goes by now) & Eddie Vedder.But it's definitely a keeper."
1,Where's the Beef?,"Great concept, but much too basic for even my 9-year-old. He does need work on where to make or backup a play, but even he was done with this CD in well under an hour. I was hoping for situations where my son had to determine where the play was based on where the runners were and how many outs there were. Unfortunately, the number of outs was not factored in. This would be great for a free web-based tutorial. But for $25, it was definitely not worth it."
4,I bought this for one song,"You Made Me RealiseI was sick of seeing the copies of this MBV classic, only available on the EP of the same name, go for in excess of $40. Then a friend tipped me off that it was on this compilation. What a deal!There are some other really cool tracks on here too, Drive Blind by Ride is a favorite of mine. The first half of the album is pretty nice really.Unfortunately, a couple of songs in second half take the title of the compilation to heart a bit too much, and are just really annoying. I feel weird saying that, because I dig some pretty abrasive 'noisy' stuff, but some of these songs just don't seem to fit this mantra, as their performers sound more like Bon Jovi than the Jesus and Mary Chain.Still worth the $10 or whatever though, just because You Made Me Realise is such a sick track, and there are a couple of other pretty tasty grooves on here. Just skip 'JC Auto' and 'Crazy' and you should be good."
2,"Portrayal of a Stupid, Annoying Person","The story of a stalker who made people's lives miserable by bothering them & their children and invading their privacy constantly.Interesting, but even more so - Sad."
1,"It Looks Beautiful, But It Isn't Functional","I returned this item the day after I received it. It is breath-taking to look at--it gleams beautifully and looked very elegant on my counter. However, I had a terrible time screwing the pole that holds the paper towels into the base. It looked as if there was no threading in the pole for the screw to grab on to. Also, the top does not come off to refill the holder. You have to unscrew the bottom from the pole every time that you need to refill the holder. Since I need to refill my paper towels about once or twice a week, this product is not my idea of functional."
2,Not good.,"I paid a lot for this Bosch Vacuum but, it was ok for about a year then it starts to break down, finally it's not working today after 5 years. time to get a new one."
3,Acid Rockabilly,"I typed this band name into search on a whim, and was frankly surprised to find it. Like another reviewer here, my band played lots of gigs with these guys around Michigan in '96 and '97, and they're a fun live act with a really distinctive, rockabilly meets psychedelia style. I caught Black Rebel Motorcycle Club on the Henry Rollins Show recently, and thought of these guys.One of the band members told me they'd named the band after a neighbor who used to do tai chi on top of a decrepit bus in his backyard, and that same sense of humor comes through both their songwriting, and their live shows.This disc, an early effort by the band, doesn't approach the tightness they achieved later, but ""Elvis in My Dungarees"" is an absolute gem of a song. I'd buy a copy of the disc just for that song. The rest of the disc is not as strong, but a nice first effort from a terrific live act."
2,Night Shadow,Disappointment. This novel definitely did not come up to the standards as our Coulter books. Story line weak and trivial
3,Night Shadow,It was easy reading. I could easily put the book down and not pick it up for a few days.
5,you won't be able to put it down!,"I read this book in 24 hrs. I love being swept away by charachters so real, they feel like family! The children are wonderful. I miss everyone in the book. the best $7.00 I have EVER spent. Thank You Catherine for the brief escape from reality!!"
5,Read this book!,"Theo, Sam and Laura Beth's antics made me roar with laughter and with every page I read I fell in love with Knight. I especially love the scene with Laura Beth and her debacle with the ink on Knight's desk. I have several of Ms. Coulter's books and have enjoyed all of them immensely. I always find myself reading them over and over. I have started buying up her earlier novels and plan to own them all. If you haven't read this book please do! You won't be disappointed!"
3,I like Catherine Coulter,I like this auther but this book was not in the fileld of her books that I enjoy most. Thanks
4,I'm not sure about this one . . .,"This one left me unsure as to my feelings for it. I LOVED the children, and the first third and last part-after their marriage-I loved, but the part in between . . . I hated the fact that Knight absolutely refused to believe that Lily was NOT, in fact, a prostitute. But I stayed up long into the night reading it anyway. I HAD to find out what happened. I was shaking during that whole portion of the book! I still didn't like it as much as Night Fire though, which has got to be one of the best books I have ever read. This book is worth reading, but it left me with mixed feelings."
4,cool,I put is on my honda slighty different with the original but still cool since my hond ais 1997 so worth it lah
5,Great!,"I really liked this CD, Kipnis does a great job on the harpsichord. I bought this when I only listened to classical occasionally; now I listen to it almost all the time, and this is still one of my favorites."
1,I'm dissappointed and frustrated,"I have a laptop and a 2nd graphics monitor at home, and bought this to calibrate both. I adjust the sliders on my IBM T40, and the Spyder software doesn't ""see"" that I've done it, although it's conspicuous on the LCD screen. The second monitor? It won't even recognize it. Over $200 wasted. I'm a graphics professional, and if I'm missing something, the instructions are woefully inadequate!"
3,An OK book,"This book has a little background of the Cairn, but does not really help the owner to work with his pet. It lacks details on how to truly care for the breed.It is a good overview for a perspective owner, but not much help if you have one."
3,Old Angry Young Man,"This book is of historical interest. Its attack on Welsh chapel religion caused a furor when it was first published. The book consists of short stories which illustrate man's inhumanity to man, religious bigotry and the ill treatment of women. The author presumably was expressing his personal feelings about the treatment of his widowed mother and her children. The topic of religion in Wales seems of little relevance today now that most of the chapels are closed. Well written and worth reading especially by students of Welsh social history."
1,Don't waste your money,I should have paid more attention to other reviews. Older publication so same old info. and outdated. Mostly just an advertisement for his online weight loss business.
5,Best of the Best from Colorado,I have most of the Cookbooks from here in Colorado & I have never been disapointed yet from one of them. I will have to say this one will be just as good as the rest.
3,DISAPPOINTED,"AFTER ONLY OWNING OUR VAC FOR THREE MONTHS IT WILL NOT HOLD A CHARGE.WHEN IT WAS WORKING, IT WORKED JUST FINE."
1,NO POWER,"I loved this product when I first got it, then 3 months later it would no longer take a charge. Ther's nothing I can do about it that would not cost more than the price I paid at their ebay store. GOOD LUCK. VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!"
2,What the...?,"I too had problems with this vacuum holding a charge. I used it once until it was completely out of juice, like the instructions said to do. I then plugged it in, and a few weeks later when I turned it on...I got nothing. It is 100% dead and I only used it once. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of one is because the one time I did use it, I loved it."
1,Not Happy with Product,"This product on the box says how powerful it is! Well if I wanted only a dust buster to pick up little pieces of dirt fine.As a vacuum I was not happy at all, on carpet it (flat) it does not pick up lint type particles. It has more power coming out of the side air then the suction.I was very disapointed with it, of course after you purchase it it is yours! Thats if you use it and get it dirty.the Euro pro is an awesome product!!I like Black & Decker products but for $69.00 it is not worth it."
2,BLACK & DECKER DUSTUSTER 9.6,I HAVE ALWAYS TRUSTED B&D PRODUCTS BUT THIS ITEM HAS DISSAPOINTED ME WE USED IT TWICE FULLY CHARGED WITH BRUSH ON GAVE US ONLY 5 MIUTES AT BEST OF RUNNING TIME WE RECHARGED IT AND LEFT IT ON OVERNIGHT USED IT NEXT DAY ANFD GOT EVEN LESS TIME COME ON B&D YOU CAN DO BETTER HOWARD PARMA HTS OHIO
3,The Black & Decker DustBuster,"The product is good for pet hair, but not much more. We were hoping it would serve to clean up around the litter box and the front door, but it is not powerful enough. Also it only holds it's charge for 15 minutes."
2,Not as great as everyone says,"I bought this vacuum after reading all the rave reviews. With 2 small children I needed something to use everyday to pick up crumbs. I was very disappointed. I currently own a Eureka Boss Lite cordless which has been just OK but that I've used for four years. I wanted something more powerful so I bought the dustbuster. This vacuum is very very heavy for a cordless, weighing in at 7 pounds on my scale. My full-size vacuum is an 8 lb Oreck so I felt this was way too heavy. Also, I was not impressed with its cleaning ability. I had to go over dirt many times before it picked up. This does not happen with the Eureka. I gave it 2 stars only because it is versatile in that it can also function as a plain old handheld but overall I was disappointed and I am returning it in the morning to look for something else."
2,Not Happy,"I am really upset with the performance of the Black & Decker cordless floor vac. The idea is great, but the vacuum is not. I used it maybe a dozen times, and the back of the handheld portion of the vacuum kept sticking to the upright portion. In essence, I had to fix the thing every time I went to use it. In it's defense, the suction was okay, and the beater brush was a good idea. Maybe I got a lemon, but I'm not willing to try it again. The vacuum is on it's way back to Amazon.com as we speak."
1,fizzled too early,"my husband bought this for our home when our last dustbuster died (it worked for several years) we have only had this a few months and it has already died. the battery doesn't hold a charge more than 10 seconds. the suction in the bottom part of the carpet brush never worked very well. i was very excited when we first got this product because it looked really cool and streamlined. unfortunately, the warranty is over and it the machine died just days after the end of warranty."
4,The Very Best Tropical Cocktails II,"f you like tropical cocktail (and I do) then there is no way you should be without this guide. You should also own it's companion ""Sippin' Sarfari."" With these two books, you pretty much have tiki and tropical drinks covered. These are the original (and sometimes with modifications) recipes. They can't be beat. I gave it only four stars for the simple reason that the layout of these books leaves (for me) a lot to be desired. It'd not that they're hard to read or anything, they just look like some guy in a print shop threw them together with a box of old clip art that they found. Just ill considered layout. A noted tiki/lowbrow artist laid them out and Mr. Berry should have gone with a professional in this line of work. It's not that particular artist's cup of tea and it shows. That sort of thing is my profession so I may be a little over critical. Alas. Buy them."
5,Comprovisation at its best.,"These 3 fine musicians, Richard Carr (violin), Mike Nord (guitar & electronics), and Georg Hofmann (percussion) are all musical academics who live in Oregon, New York, and Switzerland respectively. They have been getting together every summer for the last 20 years to make music. Their music started out good, and has only gotten better. This is their 3rd CD, though their 1st on Leo records. They have a 4th disc, also on Leo, called ""Biosphere"", which is even better. Their 1st 2 discs, ""Coast to Coast"" & ""Along the Edge"" on the German Nabel label are very hard to find. They are all excellent, and well worth your listening. Please enjoy."
4,Music That Holds Up Well After 15+ Years,"I had completely forgotten about this gem! I remember going to see these guys live back in the early 90s, and their shows were a lot of fun. It's a shame they never made it big. This isn't the usual type of music I listen to, and had it not been for the fact that I used to work with one of the Gandhis (pretty much any musician trying to make it needs a day job), I probably never would have heard of them. It's sort of funky, jazzy popish music. Many of these songs had very radio-friendly sounds, but for some reason, they were mostly overlooked (although I do recall hearing them on one of the lesser known stations in L.A.).This music has aged very well, or maybe my aging taste has mellowed rendering it more enjoyable now. The stand-out tracks are If You Love Me, Stranded, Interesting Again, Speak as One and Lose My Language."
3,Starter for Of Plymouth Plantation,"A good starter for Bradford's Of Plymouth Plantation. This is an adaptation of the aforementioned, done well without losing the old style language. BW etchings make appropriate illustrations for this read. Has a glossary of archaic words, maps, and explanations of historic persons as well. A good move from traditional Thanksgiving books."
3,lighter book,a pretty book but it doesn't show values in dollars...so for me it wasn't any help in purching lighters.thanks
3,Collectable Lighters,"small in size, but lots of pics, mostly from France, with the odd zippo. No prices, but gives a good overview of the Lighters available."
3,"GOOD BOOK, BUT NOT FOR ME","I PURCHASED THIS IN HOPES TO LOCATE A RARE FAMILY HEIRLOOM. IT IS A GENIE LATERN WHICH IS ALSO A CIGARETTE LIGHTER WHEN FILLED WITH LIGHTER FLUID. YOU LIGHT IT AND BRASS PRONGS YOU REMOVE TO LIGHT YOUR CIGARETTE. I ALSO PURCHASED ANOTHER BOOK AND IT WAS ALSO NOT HELPFUL. NEITHER HAD THIS RARE LIGHTER IN THEM, AND NEITHER BOOK HAVE BEEN HELPFUL. I DO KNOW SOMEONE WHO COLLECTS LIGHTERS, AND I PLAN ON GIVING BOTH BOOKS TO THEM IN HOPES THEY CAN BENEFIT FROM THE CONTENTS. BOTH ARE WELL ILLUSTRATED, BUT I DON'T FEEL EITHER AUTHOR HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE I NEED TO HELP ME FIND THE VALUE OF MY PERTICULAR LIGHTER. HOPEFULLY, THIS WILL BE OF HELP TO MY SPECIAL FRIEND IN LOCATUING SOME ITEMS HE HAS."
4,Buyer Beware!!!,"This dvd is a re-release of Chrome Dreams' film, ""The Who Under Review"". If you have not purchased that dvd, (as I unfortunately did), you will enjoy the program.Chrome Dreams has a very bad habit of re-releasing their dvds under new names to resell old product. I wish they would stop this practice.This dvd is very well produced, however, and the critics and writers who narrate do a fine job of telling the story of the early Who. There are many music exerpts, and the sound quality is very good.As I said, if you haven't purchased the original dvd, you will enjoy the show."
4,Excellent Overview of the Queen Rearing Process,This book by Jay Smith has been brought back into print by Bush Farms and it is a must for any beekeeper wanting to learn about rearing quality honeybee queens without a lot of specialty equipment. The best feature of this book is the summary which Michael Bush has boiled down into an almost checklist-like guide to queen rearing. The process is outlined not only for commercial breeders but also for the backyard beekeeper who needs only a few queens. This one will stay in your library.
4,Good info,"Short, to the point, good and up to date information. Shows how to raise queens and lets you understand the reasons behind the steps of the process."
2,Don't waste your time,"Don't waste your time or money. The frame itself is nice but the pictures aren't extremely clear, the so called MP3 capabilities we cannot figure out how to use and it just doesn't work the way I had hoped. Just go ahead and purchase a normal frame and take the time to switch the pictures yourself."
4,Informative and Fun,"I am a musical theatre major at the University of Oklahoma, and I purchased this book for a class on auditions. I found however it was a much better read than a standard text book. Mr. Oliver presents a large amount of very useful tips and techniques while keeping the book very ""readable"". The stories he recalls from his experience provide an insight into the art of auditioning, and they prove quite amusing for anyone who has been through the ringer of an audition on any scale. The book clips along quickly and by the time you are finished you are sure to have a smile on your face and many useable pieces of information in your head."
5,Isolani,"Highly recommended to any chess player wanting to increase his or her knowledge ""Isolani"" position. Easy to understand and it explains how to use them and play against them. Many elements covered and illustrated using Master games."
2,Consider the source...,"As a fitness professional and kettlebell instructor I really liked Scott's material intially, but as I did more and more research into his credentials I found the majority of his accomplishments are greatly exaggerated. It's very hard to trust someone with educating me on something as important as my health when he can't even be honest about his background."
5,Absolutely Wonderful!,Carolyn Boyd has done an outstanding job with Rock Art of the Lower Pecos! This excellent literary work clearly explains the rock art through extensive ethnographic research and analysis. Her contribution of this book is a landmark acheivment in the field of anthropology. I highly recommend this work to anyone with an interest in historic art or culture.
3,Can be improved,"Colours can be improved further. Not suitable to blend in with live plants.If you are blending in with fake plants, wouldnt be an issue.The suction cup needs to be a little bigger."
2,Not Up To Par,"This vacuum cleaner is the reason I am on-line right now - It's so bad that I'm looking for another one. The parts are cheap and it can't handle more than two rooms at a time. When you empty the canister, dust gets EVERYWHERE. This has been an awful vacuum cleaner. I have tried new filters, pulling hair out of the brush, and emptying it after each room. It still won't pick up pieces of fuzz from my carpet. But it does pick up dust, so at least it does something right. You're better off looking elsewhere if you don't want to be disappointed!"
5,SIMPLY AWESOME!,"What can I say that hasn't already been said about this DVD Deluxe Edition???? It's simply Elvis at his best! You get the complete, and unseen until now, footage of Elvis's arrival in Hawaii and the rehearsal show on January 12, 1973 and the absolutely complete January 14, 1973 concert that has been upgraded with new sound and picture and the footage of the songs done after the actual special were a nice touch. The original 1973 version of the television special is included for ""historical purposes""......and I actually enjoyed seeing it again even though I've seen it hundreds of times.....This is one awesome DVD box set that you do not want to miss! GET IT NOW!"
5,Very pleased.,Product came to me in a timely fashion. Everything was as described. I was delighted to be able to get the DVD that was not a new release at a reasonable price.
3,Disappointing,This DVD does not contain all the music from the original concert. What is there is great. But missing some good songs.
3,One disc didn't play,"It's a two disc set with a lot of features, including two performances that weren,t televised.The disc with the televised performance didn't play on either of my two players, or my two computers.The vender promised to send a replacement if I retracted my previous review. They never did."
5,"The King , still rockin'!",Saw this when it was broadcast years ago and it still is one of The King's best performances. My wife and I are both Elvis fans and truly believe any fan needs this dvd. This is a one of a kind concert that unfortunately can never be repeated. Do yourself a favor and add this to your Elvis collection!
4,"Great, but not excellent","It's a live show, the return of Mr. Presley to the TV. It's pretty good, but I miss some of his all time hits."
5,Just the King...! ! !,"This Box Set is a MUST for every Elvis fan at first,2nd and 3rd degree.The sound,the picture quality; everything is perfect;yes there're some mistakes hidden but it's worth everything.Really; do me a favour and see this great event of all time of legendary and timeless Elv1s Presley...!!!"
5,Now I Know What All The Fuss Is About!,"Im a 20 year old guy who has grown up on grunge and hip-hop. Until a couple of years ago, I had barely ever heard of Elvis Presley and wondered what all the fuss was about him being the ""King of Rock"" and all that. But when I watched this DVD at a friends apartment with some pals, I realized, as did my friends, that this guy has something that I have never seen - a kind of charisma and magnetism that nobody in my lifetime has even come close to! Strutting around the stage in a superman outfit with a cape, he truly looks like the king of the world. He rules. Now I know why Elvis is the King and why so many people all over the world love him so much. ELVIS RULES!"
1,Waste of Time,"Ordered the Aloha from Hawaii Via Satellite CD and it didn't play. It went right into an error code. Tried it on 2 different machines of which the other 3 CD's I ordered worked fine. I sent it back an requested another one, received it and it didn't work either. Still have not received my refund. Amazon has to know that none of these work but it must be to much trouble to pull them for CD's that play. Will not order again to many trips to the post office."
2,Beginning of the demise,"I love Elvis and the '68 Comeback Special is one of my favorites. Aloha from Hawaii is like watching Elvis self-destruct in front of your eyes. HIs eyes are empty, his speech is slurred, he is offkey, puffy, the songs that are not his standards are embarrassingly bad and overly sentimental. His covers of the Beatles and Frank Sinatra and others are weak. The '68 Comeback is to Aloha from Hawaii as Cheddar is to Velveeta, as an eclair is to a Twinkie, as ice cream is to Cool Whip. If you really love Elvis, do yourself a favor and skip this one."
5,Elvis' spectacular Aloha from Hawaii concert!,"The picture quality and sound are excellent; second only to his performance. All available footage is presented from the original broadcast version through the complete rehearsal concert and a newly re edited version. It also offers the complete arrival footage. However, I do think that it would have been more entertaining to edit the arrival footage before each of the concerts and then offer the full 17 minute arrival sequence separately if one wishes to view the entire arrival.I also feel that the ""delux"" booklet ought to have contained far better Quality photos then what is offered. A few of the photos look worse than the typical bootleg versions. Japan offered high quality pictures with song lyrics with their LP releases 20 years ago! It is a shame BMG/RCA has chosen to skimp on the budget; their is absolutely no reason for bad quality photos. The sound and DVD picture quality is excellent and the Aloha delux set makes for a wonderful gift."
5,The King,"In case someone didn't know or has forgotten, THIS is why they called him THE KING! Stunningly Brilliant and Brilliantly Stunning! Lucky are those who got to see his performance."
4,"Great Sound, Great Picture!","If you are an Elvis fan, this 2 DVD set is one that needs to be in your collection. Capturing the historic Hawaii concert, the DVD brings home the sights and sounds in terrific 5.1 Digital sound and truly wonderful pictures. Not only does it provide the original USA broadcast of the 1973 concert, it also has the original feed that was shown live to most of the world (the US did not see it until weeks later). Also provided is the rehersal show the night before and raw video of Elvis arriving to greet fans. The reason to buy the package, though, is the sound. It is obvious that a reat deal of care went into presenting the music in the 2 DVDs. A great job is also done with recreating the original live show, using the original video, which looks like it could have been shot this year. For fans of Presley or those who have an appreciation for the history of rock, this is one worth owning."
5,Elvis was the real deal,As a certified 100% Percent Elvis Fan and Graceland visitor I can say with out a doubt. When you see a concert like this I can say ELVIS IS NOT DEAD!! He lives in our hearts. He's the man.
4,Awesome Aloha,"Any Elvis fan, especially one who enjoyed this show on TV or owns the VHS, which I did, needs to have this. This is the concert the way it was meant to be seen, just Elvis and his exceptional band live without the TV editing and corny video montages. The outtakes of Elvis singing live to an empty arena (the footage of which some was used for the TV montages) and even the fans awaiting Elvis's arrival by helicopter are endearing and fun to watch. The original TV broadcast is included as well as a bonus. Just an excellent DVD set. Very much enjoyed. (My wife cried)"
5,THE KING OF ROCK AND ROLL,"Those who have never seen this recorded 1973 benefit concert from hawaii featuring elvis presley at the heights of his vegas period in music are in for a very good time. Elvis sings and entertains with such energy and zeal for this (at first!) polite crowd that even the most skeptical of ticket holders in the audience seem to finally realize that they are in the prescence of greatness .... elvis was a phenomenal entertainer! Thankfully, this performance was filmed - thus documenting once and for all the perfection of a concert in which elvis, at his best, never ceases to relent in his pursual of that perfection -for himself and for his audience. Get this dvd and see for yourself that elvis was indeed one of americas all-time, greatest treasures."
2,Feel Like I was Taken,"This wasn't worth the money I paid for the deluxe.Lots of it was nonsense...If I could sent it back I would of.... I would just bought the Aloha from Hawaii.Don't waste your money,buying this.If I could sell it now I would !!!!!!Anyone want to buy it,let me know..........."
1,WASTED MONEY,"Buy the original ALOHA FROM HAWAII; it is GREAT! The EXTRA stuff on this DVD is boring, repetitive and just a waste of money."
1,Disappointed !!!,"I enjoyed the Matthew Reynolds? e-commerce book last year and thought that this guy will keep doing good books. I was wrong, this book is for kids under 10 or for someone who never learnt any programming language."
3,Only for biginers in VB,if you have a little experince in VB5 or VB6Do Not Buy this bookit waste your time i will try to finish it in this week and g to better book .This is the best book only for beginers in ((PROGRAMMING IN GENERAL))
1,bi disappointment,"the version of ""et maintenant"" is a bad jazzed up re-recording of the original and is hardly recognizable as the same song when you buy a cd titled 20 golden (d'or) songs you have the right to expect to hear the original version that made the song famous....this version isn't even close this is becaud on a bad day, with even the background music bearing no resemblance to the original sound"
4,For those who asked for the tracklist ...,"1.Three Little Birds - Sean Paul & Ziggy marley2.Car Wash - Christina Aguilera featuring Missy Elliott3.Good Foot - Justin Timberlake and Timbaland4.Secret Love - JoJo5.Lies & Rumors - D126.Got To Be Real - Mary J Blige featuring Will Smith7.Can't Wait - Avant8.Gold Digger - Ludacris, Bobby V & Lil' Fate9.Get It Together - India Arie10.We Went As Far As We Felt Like Going - The Pussycat Dolls11.Digits - fan_312.Sweet Kind Of Life - Cheryl Lynn13.Some Of My Best Friends Are Sharks - Hans Zimmer"
3,"""Sampled"" BS&T","Did #11. Digits - (with Fan_3) give credit to sampling Blood, Sweat & Tears, ""Go Down Gambling""?If not, they'd better!"
3,okay soundtrack a review from kevin f,the soundrack is okay the promblem is the pepole in the soundtrack some of them cant even sing but some can
2,Get's old pretty fast except...,for Jojo's Secret Love. Wow. She blew everybody else out of the water with this one. She is the standout on this album. What a future she has!
1,SUCKS!!!!,"If i could give this soundtrack negative stars i would! The Sean Paul & Ziggy Vocals are great but the production was terrible! Car wash like it hasn't been done enough times, but not bad!! Will Smith sounds like he was basically forced to rap for this soundtrack, weak is the word that best describes his performance. D12 without Eminem actaully did a good job. THe Justine Timberlake song is one of the worst songs i have ever heard. Ludacris song could have been cool but whoever mixed that track must have been high when they did it. The only song that i thought was really pretty cool was the Pussy Cat Dolls song! I could for sure see that moving working well in the movie and it's a song that you can listen to on its own without the movie and not be bored!! All in all a pretty horrible soundtrack. Nice try with the artists involved i mean i love ludacris, Ziggy, D12, Missy, Christina, Mary J. & Timbaland but clearly most of them just did it for the money and ran!!"
4,delivery for the young crowd,this soundtrack is definetely geared towards the adolescents and is packed with r&b; hip-hop stars. I would not recommend buying the whole album as some songs though good will be a one time listen. Some favourite tracks of mine from this album:JoJo- secret loveavant- can't waitindia arie - get it together
1,weak&Watered down,"aside from the Cheryl Lynn track nothing else here really sticks to me.seems so formula driven like so many of the soundtracks over the past decade&change.alot of these tracks fill like filler.Mary J.Bliege doing a Re-Make of ""Got to Be real"" is aight.adding parts to it was cool.don't want to hear anyone else doing ""car wash""."
3,Only a few good songs,I would suggest downloading the individual songs you like rather than buy the whole thing. The remake of Car Wash is quite good
4,A Very Nice Surprise!!,"I normally don't but soundtracks because of the lack of consistency. I was suprised that this is a very well put together collection of songs. My main reason for purchasing the CD was because Cheryl Lynn has come back to delight our eardrums with her awesome voice!! By far her song ""Sweet Kind Of Life"" is my favorite. For those who don't know, she is the artist who first made ""Got To Be Real"" in 1978, that Mary J. Blige and Will Smith remake on this CD!! I also like ""Good Foot"" by Justin and Timbaland. NICE!!!"
4,This album is great!,"As someone who enjoys children's movies, but would never think of purchasing a soundtrack of one - this album is great! It is full of vibrant, funky songs and some fun remakes. Of course, there is the usual fitting in of the ""shark theme,"" but it doesn't overwhelm the tracks, which are just fun."
3,Good Foot,"I bought it for ""Good Foot"" which is the only track appealing. The other songs are blah.This CD's music isn't for young kids, based on it's content. The computer animated characters are misleading to parents."
3,Where is the good song?,"I love this soundtrack but it is missing one song, the part where lola is seen swimming up to oscar and the lyrics are similar to this ""she's bad, she's tough"" something like that anyway. Thats what i wanted this album for but i dont even know the name of this song!"
2,"Good, but...","I purchased the Gemini DJX-03 headphones after searching all through amazon for headphones that weren't too expensive, but were sturdy. When I purchased these headphones, I was really excited: Good quality sound, comfortable, the cord was nice and long, and on top of that they were adjustable. FANTASTIC, even. Unfortunately in a mere week of use I put the headphones on and found that the right side was dead. Almost completely useless on the right side, although it is still functioning on the left. I was very frustrated because of how quickly they seemed to die, and I took very good care of them."
2,Ouch!,"I wanted some decent headphones to use at work and these pinch my head like I'm in a vice after an hour. They sound good, but that doesn't do me much good when I can't bear to wear the things."
3,mixed feelings with value,The product is amazing however the quality of the materials used is questionable. They sound better than doctor Dre headphones and thats a guarantee. They dont last as long however the price makes up for that. I am definitely buying more of them.
3,Does the job,"This headphone set is very light and somehow solid, however is not very well made, the plastic looks and feels cheap. Good for general listening because it doesn't have a good sound either, but for $15 is ok."
2,"Not bad sound, but won't last","The sound quality isn't bad on this set of headphones, but it wasn't long until the plastic near the earpieces began to crack. It is now cracked on both sides above the ""ear muffs,"" but I have continued to use them, albeit with great care so not to crack the set in half."
4,Nice fit. nice sound,"These head phones are nice. They fit well...a little tight, but the sound is excellent on both my iPod and my DJ mixer. priced right too."
3,Beautiful Boy,"While going through a separation, a couple learns that their son has murdered fellow students and teachers at the college he is attending. Then he kills himself. Dealing with the aftermath, these two also have to deal with the media, family, friends, co-workers and themselves.This was a tough subject, and although the acting was magnificent, I found the movie to be slow. Some of the characterizations were like cardboard figures while the two main characters had depth (I guess because they had the most emotional scenes). I had expected it to be a real tear-jerker and had the tissues ready. Didn't need them. It had been on my watch list for some time, but it is not one that I would view again."
1,Beautiful Boy,"This is a story about a couple in the brink of divorce, and a son in college. Planning a family vacation, the son calls home to find out information, and just to say hello. The next day the parents wake up to horrible news, there's been a massacre at their son's college. This movie is really depressing, and slow. Needless to say, this movie hit the trash can after we viewed it, don't care to see it again. So, if you want something totally depressing, totally slow moving, this is the movie for you."
4,There are no answers,"`Beautiful Boy' is an actors' vehicle and Michael Sheen and Maria Bello accomplish their jobs superbly. Their marriage is not on solid ground. Their son is in his first year of college. It is never stated where he is attending school, but this has many of the patterns of the Virginia Tech killings. We see what the parents of the shooter go through. They never come to grip or resolution of what has happened, and maybe they never will; but the story that unfolds is riveting and true to reality.This is a realistic script and the acting of all is not overplayed. We can feel the questions that all parents would ask...what we did wrong? whose fault is this?The DVD has a few extras, just a few deleted scenes and an audio commentary with the writer/director. There is also the film trailer. The extras do not have subtitles. The film has English and Spanish subtitles available.It is indeed a thought-provoking and timely film to see."
4,A parent's worst nightmare...but great movie.,"I have one word for the movie, ""Beautiful Boy"": Wow! This is a parent's worst nightmare - or at least one of them. It brings the reality of our world straight into your living room. It makes you take a good hard look at your life and how things can change in an instant. How do you wake up in the morning and know that your son committed a mass murder? Take the time to sit and watch the movie and at the end of the day, count your blessings. Great movie!"
2,Why do tabs cost so much????,"I do not understand why a white piece of paper with tabs and some stickers would cost a hundred dollars, these tabs look nicer than your average insertable tabs but definitely NOT worth the money..."
3,Wish it had,"It shipped without problem. It fits my Jet midi-lathe with the #2 Morse taper pretty well - it seats well but when used in the headstock, it can vibrate loose which is dangerous. Unfortunately the morse taper end does not have a threaded hole to secure the chuck in the headstock with a long bolt, had I realized this I would have ordered one that has to more safely secure the chuck in my headstock (they are available)."
4,Great product! Small and capable.,"This little vacuum packs lots of power into a very small package. I've used it on carpet and wooden floors with great success. The accessories are not the highest quality plastics, but they are strong enough and well shaped to get into tight corners. The bags are self sealing and MUCH nicer than those nasty bagless cups that get dust and dirt everywhere when you try to empty them. This light weight and powerful vacuum is great for our three floor town house cause it's easy to carry up and down stairs and really does a good job picking up dirt! I would recommend it to anyone."
4,Customer satisfaction,"This product is great for hardwood/tile floors, however, it does not work very well on carpeting."
2,Not impressed,"I bought this vacuum over a year ago and I have not been impressed. It flips over easily, blows air right at you (cannot re-direct air flow), doesn't pick up very well on hardwood floors and does not have a brush attachment for small areas. I also don't like the price of the bags! The ""indicator"" light for the bag replacement stopped working a few weeks after I got it. The one thing it has going for it is that it is very quiet. I would not recommend it."
2,Never again...,"I bought this vacuum based on my husband's experience with Bosch tools in his carpentry studio. That was a mistake. The suction is poor; the hose and bags don't always match up, leaving dust to collect inside the cavity (despite my repeated efforts to line everything up correctly); the vent points directly at the user, blowing hot, stinky air on you while you work, and cannot it be redirected; the bags are expensive and difficult to match up with the model you own; the cord is too short by about three feet; it tips over easily....shall I go on? It appears that the engineers who do such a fine job with their power tools were left off of this project. I will end up replacing this vacuum far soon than expected and it sure won't be with another Bosch!"
3,Hard Surface Floor Only,"While this vacuum has some great suction, it was not meant for carpets or rugs. I can't even move the head back and forth because it gets caught on the carpet.It does work great on hard surface floors and it is easy to move around because of the light weight."
2,It's compact but there's no Plus!,"I purchased to clean hardwood and tile floors, vacuum upholstry, and under furniture where I can't reach with an upright. First, it doesn't pick up the light dust covering on the hardwood so I feel it isn't removing the dust from the oriental rugs. I have to hold it at a certain angle in order to create the suction which is quite difficult when lying on the floor trying to get under sofa or beds. It will pick up large items such as cheerios if you hold it in just the right manner. If I wanted to go to vacuum 101, I would have signed up for it. I wanted to dust with it as canisters lend themselves to this job but cannot find a dusting brush for it. The positive is that it is light."
5,Good Industrial,"I've been looking for some good hardcore industrial, and have been disappointed with the scene recently, that is until I stumbled across this CD. Words can't describe it, go buy it!"
1,Junk,"I join the chorus of those who say this is just a terrible piece of goods. Very, very poor battery performance. Despite following ""rules"" such as allowing it to run down completely, not leaving on charging all the time, Etc. it still fails to take and hold a full charge. Runs at low power for only very short time. Not worth buying, not worth replacing batteries, not worth having one !"
1,Not Worth The Dirt It Supposedly Picks-up,"I've had the DustBuster for less than a year and have used it for light clean-up in my kitchen. The blower on the unit actually blows the dirt away, so I end-up having to chase after it.My biggest complaint, however, is that after 6 months of relatively infrequent use, the unit only ran for about 45 seconds. Now it doesn't run at all, because the battery has to be replaced, and I precisely followed the directions regarding proper battery care in order to prolong the life of the battery.Please save your money and just use a broom or a more reliable shop-vac. The battery performance in this unit has been extremely disappointing."
2,Black & decker Dust Buster Model 250 Type 2,"Jan 29, 2003This vacuum is ok for small clean ups, but not the best. It is not avery reliable product. Received this vacuum as a gift 12/25/ 99. After a year and half, the battery had to be replaced. Now six months later in Jan 2003, it is not working. It only runs less than a half minute. It was not used that extensively. I wll not spend the money to check for repair or replace the battery."
1,Just try and find a replacement battery...,Go ahead...I dare ya...just try and find a replacement battery for one of these things....
1,batteries,"This is not worth buying. It is extremely underpowered and batteries are nearly impossible to find. Even went on the Black and Decker website, no luck."
4,Absolutely wonderful,"We bought this item for quick pickups, to clean up after our 2 cats. The hand vac takes no time at all to charge and it holds its charge for quite a while. I would forget to hang it back on its charger and a couple days later I would grab it and the charge would still be there. In fact we had the hand vac in transit for 3 months when we moved last, and when it finally got to our new home it still had its charge.Now with our toddler constantly dropping crumbs and whatever else all over, I can just run around with the hand vac real quick and clean everything else. It has been a real time saver for my home. Instead of pulling the vaccum cleaner out 3 times a day I just grab the hand vac. I highly recommend this product to anyone who loves a clean floor."
3,reliable but so so performance,"I haven't had the issues with my batteries running out, except when I've used it for longer than 10 minutes at a time. I've had mine for about 3, almost 4 years. It picks up kitty litter, but isn't the greatest at fur or anything that might be remotely static-y or sticky. I got mine from a friend, but I'd probably buy something else. The filter is a royal pain in the kiester, and always skeeves me out, blah! On the whole, reading other reviews, I'm shocked that mine has held out so long...we use it all the time!"
1,No way ...,"Lost it's charge within minutes, then never fully recharged. No way am I going to buy a new battery for this piece of junk. What a waste of money."
1,Very Disappointed,"This item work once and then ceased to do so. I was so disgusted realizing that I had waisted my money on a name brand that I had been disappointed by previously. I couldn't bring myself to through it away and there it sits on the base constantly charging but never charged. Indeed, not a trustworthy brand. Maybe Black and Decker should stick with powertools."
1,Battery Problems,"I share the sentiment of many others regarding the battery. I've had mine for maybe 4 months when all of a sudden it would only run at full power for less than a minute. I see that people are saying that you shouldn't leave it on the chargers all the time. If that is the case, why did they make the charger to function as a storage place as well. It comes with screws to place it on the wall. I keem mine there all the time, plugged in. If they didn't want people to keep it on the base all the time they should have stressed that in the direction and modified the design of the base. I loved it until the battery started running down on me."
4,Works well,This unit lasts long enough to clean up small areas--exactly as it is supposed to do. Works particularly well cleaning up fallen pine needles from a Christmas tree. ;)
3,It's okay...,I was really surprised to see all of the positive reviews once I received the dvd for my little girl. It's the same old episodes she has been seeing on tv (almost none actually about Minnie as the main character) and she didn't even finish watching it. She and I were both pretty disappointed in it. It's simply a compilation of random episodes and titled I Love Minnie.
5,My Kids love it,"My 4 and 2 year olds love this. 5 different episodes. Minnie is the main focus, but all the characters are there."
1,very disappointed with the digital copy feature,"sure these are all episodes that have already aired and sure i didn't want to bring a dvd player with us on a 3 hour flight. i purchased it any way since this version was advertised with a digital copy that can be burned from a laptop and copied to a tablet. my daughter will gladly watch episodes that she's already seen so long as her mmch friends are on screen. i wasn't able to burn the windows media option since there's a hiccup in the data cd that is VERY sensitive about which version of media player runs on your windows machine, so i burned the iTunes copy that was offered only to find that it wasn't compatible with my android tablet. double drats. the dvd and data cd included in the package will now serve as excellent drink coasters for my daughter's mommy and daddy. too good to be true usually is -- except it cost me much more than i normally spend on coasters to protect our furniture."
4,Does what it's supposed to.,"Great for woodworking and light machine work. Seems accurate, well made with straight, clean edges, reasonably good finish on the scales. The over all finish is not quite up to the standards of the classic US/UK made scales from the old days but very useful and a good value for the price."
1,Not what I expected,"This book is very basic. It has a basic explanation of conditions, but does not go in depth on any particular condition. It will explain a what a rash is, but if you want to know why or how to cure a rash on your baby's face that has a particular look or pattern, this is definitely not the book for you."
4,A Great Snapshot of a Day on the River,"In The Boats on the River, Marjorie Flack captures a day's snapshot of the commerce, play and work that takes place through the different boats' activity on a great river: ferryboat, riverboat, tugboat, ocean liner, sailboat, motorboat, submarine, freightboat, and warship. Her old-fashioned pictures are very well drawn, earning the book a Caldecott Honor in 1946, and her detail-rich text is rhythmic and enjoyable. This is a perfect book for young listeners just transitioning out of nursery rhymes into more complex stories, and an outstanding choice for any child interested in boats."
3,"Nice, but politically incorrect","This is a very nice book with lovely pictures, and nice words. My 2 year old son loves it, and the boats. HOWEVER, there is a picture of a warship, and I'm not sure how to explain this to a toddler. Without that, I'd give it 4 stars."
5,great cd,this cd has much of the traditional Christmas music. this cd is top 5 christmas cd's i have. merry christmas. gf
2,Left me feeling deflated,"Reading this gave me the same feeling reading Plato did in school; one is left with the impression that nothing useful has been said, that one has simply witnessed clever exchanges. All that stays with one is the process of well conducted argument.I bought the book at a book fair in Bangkok after I read the first couple of pages, where Mr Rahula asks K why his teaching is *exactly* like the Buddha's on *every point* while K denies any connection with Buddhism.K never answers.He shifts away from the question with a, ""May I ask, sir, why you compare?"" and they never get back to it. Sad considering that ""A Dialogue with Buddhists"" is in the book's title. I wouldn't recommened this book to anyone."
3,Good Resource for Non-beginners,"I am teaching IMC for the first time at the college level. I've found that my students find this book confusing and a bit dated at times. I have to agree with them. I do enjoy the structure of the book. This book will help keep you (or you students) organized, and it will give you the tools necessary to write an IMC plan."
5,"The Big ""U""","My grandfather gave me a model of the SS United States back in the 50's and I had it for many years. I think mom got rid of it when I left the house. The Big ""U"" has always facinated me and have seen it several times while in Philadelphia. It is such a beautiful ship that must be preserved. The book gives a nice history of the ship and has info on related liners of the day."
5,WHAT A LADY.,I LOVE TO GET MY HANDS ON ANY THING THAT HAS TO DO WITH S.S. UNITED STATES SHIP. I SEE SOME ONE WROTE THEY DIDNT GET TO SEE HOW SHE STARTED OR HOW SHE WAS MADE. ITS THE STORY OF THE SHIP NOT HOW SHE WAS MADE ITS HER HISTORY. THATS HOW I GOT TO AMERICA. THERE ARE OTHER BOOKS OF HER THAT LET YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT HER WHO CREATED HER. HOW IT WAS BUILT AND SO ON. I LOVE THIS SHIP I CANT BELIEVE HOW MANY THINGS I OWN WHICH ONCE WAS ON HER THROUGH E-BAY. I KNOW IT WILL NEVER BE THE SAME. BUT IN MY HEART SHE HOLDS SO MUCH. SHES STILL HERE SITTING IN PHILLY AT THE PIER. AND WHATS FUNNY IVE CRYED OVER HER THEN ALL THE STOYIES ABOUT THE OTHER GREAT LINERS THAT SANK HORRIBLY. SHES THE S.S. UNITED STATES.WHAT A LADY
1,Over sold again.,"According to the description, I t hought I would learn abuit how the ship was constructed and some technical detaIL. But this book just goes on and on about the financing and the wall street jerks that raised the money. Then it goes into detail about the celebrities that rode on the ship. what a bore!! I couldn't finish it."
2,"Try Shiva's other DVD instead, Yoga Shakti","i believe this DVD is just a subset of Shiva's Yoga Shakti DVD!You're better of buying the full Yoga Shakti DVD for another 6-bucks which includes this practice and more. I absolutely LOVE the Yoga Shakti DVD and would highly recommend that instead!Please see my other DVD reviews on Amazon, including Yoga Shakti ;o)"
5,sun salutations,Sun SalutationsI realllly love this dvd. Her voice is soooo soothing. The sequences are wonderful. Music is cool and easy to listen to.Instruction is right on. A few power vinyasas...GRRRReat!! Thank you Shiva for contributing to my yoga career.A definate must have.
4,Sun Salutations,"I tried this DVD through Netflix when I first started Yoga at a gym so I could practice at home. It was a little hard to follow even though the instructor talks you through the moves. So many are head down moves that you can't watch her do them and keep up. I did yoga at the gym for another year or so, and then tried this DVD again. Now I love it - so much that I quit the gym. I love this Yoga DVD because you can choose the workouts you want to do, which changes them up so you don't get bored and allows you to fit a workout into your time schedule."
2,It Held More Promise,"It held more promise than it produced. I had read great things about Rae's stuff, and I live for sun salutations! So, it was an easy buy. But is was flat, repititous -- even given the fact that sun salutations are sun salutations. Nevertheless, I can do more with one on my own before my first cup of tea ! Disappointing. I may try somethign else of hers, but I am a bit sun-shy (pun intended!) now."
4,Fix for the uneven filling problem!,"If you are experiencing issues with one cup filling up more than the other, make sure the filter basket is in its holder PERFECTLY level - it is very sensitive to minor changes in tilt/angle. Seems a bit cheaply made, but you get what you pay for. Brews a decent cup of coffee, but not very hot. Cool enough to drink right after it's done brewing - I suppose this isn't a negative for most."
1,uneven disaster,spill one...... and the half full one. I tried everything. and the poorly designed lids.. well you'll see. At any price not worth it unless they pay u 2 take it! Threw mine out within a month. should of been the 1st day
2,My first Amazon return,"A few times it worked great, but mostly it brewed uneven. I'm not being a nitpicker here... Literally one cup would overflow and the other would be 3 inches below the brim. There was no pattern to it, sometimes it was the left one, sometimes the right one, sometimes neither. Filling the reservoir and seeing where the water level falls is challenging... don't mess up because there are holes in the back and the water will pour right out the back and all over your counter! It only took two days before I realized this was not worth the money or the time."
2,Non drinking lid and no permanent filter,"The lid is unusable, the thermos effect is not effective and there seems to be no permanent filter available. Paper filters are passe and they should consider having a mesh filter available.The brewer does make a good cup of coffee and it is very hot if used immediately."
4,"Fast shipping, exactly as ordered",Thanks! Procuct came very quickly and was exactly as described! Very low price as well. Citrus flavor doesn't work as well as original but oh well.. Thank you!
3,"Why pay, when you can get it for free?","Not that there's anything wrong with this product, but why pay for it when you can get it for free. I recently bought a pair of sneakers and they came with a little packet of Silica Gel - you know, the packet that says ""do not eat?"" Then I bought a new stereo, and there were several little packets. These things are everywhere.Sure, this particular brand has a ""citrus taste"". But is that really worth $10? Not for me! I'll get my silica for free."
2,The post broke,I got these for my wife as she had been looking for a pair of square hoops for a while without luck. She only wore them a few times and the post broke off one of the earrings.
5,Good Set!,I remember doing a few paint by number sets as a kid so I picked this one up for fun. It worked well. I had had trouble with some sets before that are supposed to give you the paints to go with the numbers but I ended up one short or had an incorrect one. This came with the correct paints and the paint seems to be high quality. As someone who always wanted to paint but I'm not very good at creating my own art and these paint my number kits are fantastic!
2,"I did not received this painting. I had ordered several,but this one I did not receive",I had ordered several paintings as a gift for Christmas. I lost track of the ones I ordered. But this is one I DIDN'T receive.
5,"Teachers do live at school, don't they?","Whenever my students see my outside of the school setting, they are always shocked. This book is about a boy was sure all the teachers lived at school, ate dinner in the cafeteria, slept in the lounge, etc., until his teacher moves in to his apartment building. Oh no!! He not only sees her carrying out garbage, but sees her wearing sandals that reveal she has TOES!! This is cute for kids (who still may persist in believing teachers live at school), and it would be an ideal gift for the soon-to-be-teacher. Funny text and pictures make this a winner for 6-8 year olds."
5,essential punk rock history,"This book is a fun and fantastic view of one of America's most important and influential punk clubs, filled with an impressive collection of photos, flyers and interviews spanning the venue's history. The history told here is essential to anyone who considers themselves part of the punk scene, DIY or underground culture, or who is interested in the ways in which a radical community space can spring up from the ground and last for years."
3,Just Okay,I bought this a year ago and have never really been that happy with the performance. It doesn't suck very well and you have to take the whole thing apart to unblock a blockage which happens quite often. Finaly last week to my morbid relif if gave up on me. So I got to buy a new vacuum and and very happy with it.
1,EUSHREAKA !,"I have found it...doesn't have any suction,overheats the motor,has a deafening motor (even with earplugs)and a tough time getting the hose to stay put after using an accessory.A wet Bounty picks up more dirt. Off to the dumpster (I have a moral code that prevents me sending it to Goodwill) its that bad."
3,"Ho-Hum... OKAY VACUUM,","This vacuum works fine in most cases, but it does clog easily and that is a pain to deal with."
1,NEVER AGAIN!!!!!! WORST VACUUM I'VE EVER OWNED!!,"I purchased this vacuum a few months back, and I absolutely hate it!!!It has very little suction...it wouldn't even pick up popcorn kernals!!! The hose is constantly getting clogged, and it spits half of what you go over out the back end!!!If you truly want to clean your carpets, BUY SOMETHING ELSE!!If I could give this vacuum 0 stars I would!!!!!"
5,Great vacuum!!,"Wow- this a great vacuum, it picks up everything-even cat & dog hair which most vacuums won't!! I definitely got my money's worth with this purchase!!"
1,Eureka the Boss...........DO NOT BUY IT!,"I bought this vacuum july 19, 2003. It went to the dump on October 25, 2003. The vacuum is built poorly, the parts keep breaking. When the roller broke, that was the end......threw it away and bought a bissel."
4,Great attachments!,"An enjoyable vacuum. This is a powerful vacuum with very handy attachments. Straightforward assembly; works great to dust as well as vacuum carpets. There's no specific 'bare-floor' setting, but the crevice & wand attachments work well to suck up dust in corners. I'm looking forward to using the roller-brush on the stairs."
1,o stars if possible,"I have spent more time unclogging the hose than vacuuming. How can a company that has been making vacuums for years offer a product that clogs during every use, turns itself off from overheating within 10 minutes of use, and has poor suction? The Boss of nuisance."
3,Fascinating look inside...,I found this book fascinating. A look into why women cheat. I think every married woman could relate to one of the stories in this book.
1,"Poorly witten, poorly presented in True Confessions style","If more sexual detail were present, this could easily make a series of stories for True Confessions magazine. That is how poorly this books reads; the stories of the women in this book are presented in template formula. If the authors had possessed strong interview and editing skills and the proper backgrounds, the book could have been compelling and relevant. Instead, it was an easy way for an attorney and a novelist to make money. Shame on Hyperion for sensationalizing this subject in such a fashion and for publishing such trash."
2,Did we read the same book?,"Started out interesting, ended up feeling like a paint by the numbers plot. I could see the ending coming a long way away -- the character and plot development were pretty predictable. I felt that the details of the various races were pretty tired -- nothing really new there. Waded through the last third of the book just because I'd bought it, not because I was really interested in seeing the ending.Your mileage may vary, though."
5,"A very complete, easy to do curriculum.","I've been home schooling my son for 2 years now and this is an awesome curriculum! It's complete, informative, easy to follow, and most important- my son enjoys it!! It contains daily lesson plans as well as a list of potential daily activities. You can easily modify it to suit your child's needs. It is extremely well rounded and helps to build a solid foundation in the basics. I would highly recommend it. I am planning on using Jean Wolff's 2nd grade curriculum in the fall!"
5,So happy!,I am sooo happy with the immaculate condition of this book and really looking forward to starting first grade with my son in the fall!
4,A Very Good Book,This was my first year homescooling. This was a great start. It has all the subjects that most curriculums dont offer. Some things I didnt get but it was just a few. For the most part with a little more experience in homeschooling it was really helpful and really affordable.
4,A Great Album -- Khan Doing Monk,"Fresh off his monumental work on Steely Dan's Gaucho, Steve went into the studio and cut these fabulous tracks. The three-piece really works, and Ron Carter on bass is exceptional. But it's Khan that really shines -- his creative guitar interpretation of Monk's original angular piano sound makes for heavenly listening, awash with texture, color, and personality. Highly recommended."
3,Good solo start,"This is a nice start to Euros' solo career,but I disagree with folks that say it's ""up there"" with early Gorky's. I wish there were more finished songs and less of the Lo-Fi songs that are peppered throughout this release.Maybe his new one is better? I'll check it soon and see.But this has all the personality that you've come to expect from Mr. Childs and company....but this time just from his angle.Like I said a good start. I hope better is to come....."
3,Decent action movie that is worth the rental!,"This direct-to-video release stars Dean Cain as Max Hooper, a professional jewel thief. He agrees to do one last heist for an unknown source. However, things don't go as planned when a fire starts in the building that Max is working in. He now has to decide whether to keep working and retrieve the data information he was originally hired to get, or to help rescue the people trapped inside the building as the fire spreads. Dean Cain does a decent job playing his character, a man with a major moral dilemma. The visual effects are OK, but I think it's the good performances by the actors that help make this movie stand out from other direct-to-video titles. I definitely recommend this title for the next time you are looking for a decent movie rental."
2,It's not the worst rental,"Dean Cain, the one time Super-Man, plays Max Hooper the super-thief. He can break into any company and steal any thing for the right price. Unfortunately his latest heist ends him up in a high-rise in which someone else has set a fire to hide their own attempts to steal the product. Now the thief finds himself having to be the hero rescuing everyone in the building. Unfortunately the other thief is still in the building and the F.B.I. & C.I.A. are outside waiting for Max.The movie is barely passable. Dean Cain is a fun actor and has done much better with more improved material but here he is saddled with a weak script and pretty poor direction."
5,Just what my son needed,"My two year old is always asking to see pictures of horseys on my phone, I would rather he looked at a book then an electronic device so I bought this book. It was just an added bonus that it's a touch and feel book so he can experience horseys on a different level. The quality of the book is great, the only disappointment being that the story is kind of blah... although my son doesn't seem to mind."
1,Wrong Item,"Its Dc Kratos 5.2"" tall dont buy its not the item of the picture. I they send me the wrong item twice."
4,great uk mod comp,"great compilation of mod uk tracks from the 60s this is one of the more better compilations to come out last decade regarding this era, i just wish the booklet was a bit more informative. great cd though."
4,An entertaining and enjoyable read,Excellent writing with well developed characters. I can tell within the first few pages if I am going to like a book; this was one of those. The ending was complete but yet set up an exciting opening for the next book. Well done Merline.Author of al-Qaeda Strikes Again
1,Haven't received it yet!,"I really don't hate it, but my subscription doesn't start til January 2013. So get back to me in the New Year."
2,Cheap hardware and leather,"Leather has some kind of finish on it that makes it appear to be vinyl. The leather is a poor quality, as is the hardware.Says ""made in China with American Leather"""
3,Quaint book,"This book is chock full of wonderfully vintage illustrations and photography and is clearly written-- for that alone I am giving it a conservative 3 stars. But other than that it would likely get a 2.The information is really basic so it's a rather small book; a good flipping book because of the above, but for a beginner it would need to be supplemented further with other books. It assumes you are using McCall's commercial patterns, like any big sewing brand name book.The best beginner books I have found was the Vogue Sewing book, and Reader's Digest Complete Guide to Sewing."
5,The only Tribal Tech you will need,"This album was recorded under armed guard during the Los Angeles riots. This quartet sounds much larger with the able Scott Henderson and Gary Willis at the helm. Needless to say there is an edge to the proceedings with 2 improvised tracks RIOT and AFTERMATH. However incisive humour is present from the outset with THE BIG WAVE. A powerful fusion classic of the future.With 2 guitar heroes writing great charts like those heard on ILLICIT, you cannot fail to go wrong. In short, if you need Tribal Tech, then buy this one, it's the Poodle's Privates"

3,Sharp's Set Five Review,"I am quite disappointed in Sharp's Set Five. It was the most expensive of the 5 sets, had only two new episodes, and the third disc was a made-for-video rehash of the Sharp's story. I am an avid fan of the Bernard Cornwell's work and though the Sharp's movies are not high quality cinematography...I enjoy the plot lines. The packaging needs to be reworked to put all the stories into 3 or 4 sets. I'm actually sorry I spent the money on it."
1,Not worth it,Thought this might be the answer to our desire for a telephoto lens. It definitely is not that. It is akin to holding a magnifying glass in front of your camera lens. The reality is that you probably should just go buy a better camera if you are looking for improved optics.
1,Bad Information on Camera Lens,The information listed with this product stated that it was compatible for a Sony Cybershot DSC- H3 camera. I have spend nearly a month trying to find a way to attach the lens. According to Sony it will not work.I have wasted a ton of time and money.
2,Adapter kit did not work.,"The adapter kit for the lens did not fit. At this time, the lens does not screw on to the camera and is not usable."
4,Pretty neat concept,"I got the first episode as a preview from the feb04 volume of Newtype magazine. And when I got home to watch the DVD I thought that this was a pretty cool anime. Its about a young man who is out on a journey, and he comes across a town that seems abandonded except for these robot workers there. He soon finds out that there are people living there, but they are all alone. As he leaves the town, he discovers that they all have telepathy, and are scared of each other because they know what each other is thinking.This is a pretty cool anime, I will probably get more in this series :D"
5,Travel Your Soul,"Kino's Journey starts off with a simple premise - a young traveler visiting the countries of the world, staying no more than three days. And quickly evolves in to a more reveling look at human nature through the eyes of the traveler. The countries quickly become a back drop for the deeper meaning of the episode. Using the current surroundings and dialog the between the main character and the motorrad Hermes the viewer is invited to take a deeper look at the world around them. This anime is highly recommended for anyone seeking a more deeply rooted anime that leads to philosophical thought and discussion. However, it is best noted that the DVD carries a suggested age rating of 15+ due to some disturbing moments in episode 2 ""A Tale of Feeding Off Others"" and episode 4 ""Land of Adults""."
5,A Thinking Anime,"Kino (whose sex in ambiguous, for a reason) is off on a journey...you will find out why soon enough, so don't ask until you get to that episode or it will ruin a lot for you. He/She has a talking motorcycle named Hermes. basically, thats all the plot I can tell you without ruining a lot.In this anime Kino encounters a new world (contained within a new town) each episode. The viewer sees these towns and must take in each of their problems and decide what that problem means...there is war, loss, betrayal, cannibalism, mythical religion, the end of the world...within Kino's journey.This anime reminds me a lot of Lain and the like..where all the questions are not answered, but that it becuase, in life, these kinds of questions aren't answered at all, either. I loved this anime, its about time a good ""thinking"" anime came out. Kino is it!"
3,Could have been much better,"Jack-O is the kind of horror flick thats fun to rent an laugh at. It had a good concept and i agree that i Dimmension Films got a hold of it. It just might have been scary-somewhat. Still, I rented it and I enjoyed for the simple fact that it was so chessy. i like the idea of the pumpkinman."
5,Ignore the reviews...................,"Ok you can't expect high quality acting and special effects from a B movie....this movie is fun and cheesy which was meant to be,funny not scary. It is ver creative unlike the stupid Horror movies of today,apparently people who like saw,and hostel and other stupid movies like that should stay away from this movie.Invite freinds make popcorn and eat junk and perpare to have fun while watching this movie.It is a cult classic This movie defintely deserves a place in any horror fan collection who appreciate B Movies.Please do not take this movie seriously or else that will take the joy out of it....Great Halloween Film.............."
2,Um...Uh...Well there is some good killings!,"ok, this movie has both incredibly annoying actors, and cheap effects! there is only two cool things about this movie, the kiilings are cool (but not all that original) and pumpkin jack looks cool! if you want this movie, don't pay alot of money for it, its really not worth more than $10!"
3,Looking for Laughs?,"A while back, my friend and I went to get a horror film of ghetto proportions, and found this gem in our local video store. We could not have been more delighted! This movie is the absolute best to make fun of, and just have a good clean laugh at! The acting is quite possibly worse than an elementary Christmas show (my personal favorites from the film: The pure ""terror"" in the little boy's voice when he is being buried alive, and the Oscar worthy acting skills of the wife of the man in old times who goes off to kill Jack-O). The producers of this movie blew their budget on the opening lightening sequence, making the other effects laughably fake. If you're looking for a scary, quality horror movie, keep moving on. But if you want to have some good fun laughing at and making fun of a movie so bad that the participants must hang their heads in shame to know it resides on their resumes? You have found it."
1,[Junko]-O,"A very poor attempt at a b-movie. Apparently it's very hard to make a purposefully stupid movie these days. Boring, not bad enough to be good. Not cheesy enough to laugh at. No compelling gore. An occasional chuckle from the 6-grade school-play script."
1,Lame-O,"I watched this movie by accident and still regret it 2 weeks later. I love B movies, but this one puts them all to shame. The plot is so weak I found myself trying to make one up just so I could continue watching. If you are a fan of actors that not only cannot act but have no heart, and a story that isn't really there watch it, but if not avoid it at all costs."
1,Stay away from Jack-O!,"Jack-O is doubtlessly one of the most ridiculous horror movies I've ever seen. It's so bad it's insulting.The effects are so ridiculous you don't know if to laugh or to cry; the so-called actors should get another job (even Linnea Quigley is disappointing), and the dialogues are as low as they can get. I like cheap little horror movies if they can at least deliver some thrills, but Jack-O is just a waste of time from the beginning to the end. But what is really detestable is that they put in some material featuring John Carradine who died years before Jack-O was made, and then use another guy for the wide shots. How stupid do those guys think the audience is? Next time producer Fred Olen Ray (Beverly Hills Vamp) should direct himself, and not the obviously untalented Steve Latshaw. I'd recommend every horror fan to stay away from this waste of celluloid."
1,"Run for your life, from this movie","Bad, Bad, Bad...that's what this is. These movies about Jack O Lantern's have got to get better. i guess the best so far is jack O Lantern, and it is not great, but it is better than this"
2,Looks as if it was made in 1960!,"Jack-o had a good story to it but the acting was okay but the sound quality was worse. Even though I never lived through this time, I have seen movies that were made in 1960. This was a movie that looked as if it came from that time. Since the movie was made in 1995, the quality was poor. I gave it two stars instead of one because I thought it had a good story to it."
5,"UNFORGETTABLE, BRILLIANT, ESSENTIAL",When I bought this cd in '92 I had no idea who-the-hell Leonard Cohen was. From the first listen I recognized The Future as being the most beautiful music I've ever heard. It doesn't get any better than this folks. Take heed if you're reading these reviews and buy this recording!
4,"""Let's do something crazy, something absolutely wrong ...""","A great album to pass the time while you're waiting for the miracle to come. It's marred by a couple of rather useless cover songs, but the original material on this album is all pretty strong. Even ""Closing Time"", which makes me laugh at an image of Leonard Cohen at a square dance in my head when I hear it, has good lyrics to make up for its country music influences. Cohen's voice has never sounded better than it does on this album, especially on ""Waiting For the Miracle"", a personal favorite. Not as consistent as I'm Your Man, but easier to get into than Various Positions, it's a very good latter-day Leonard album."
3,"Leonard Cohen,The Future","Too many repeats of old songs.They all sound the same.If you have his early music,don't waste your money on this one. Sorry!!"
3,An Acquired Taste?,"I heard one of the tracts in a class on mediation and thought I would try the entire CD. Leonard Cohen is an acquired taste. I am in the early stages of this process. Much of his work sounds the same to my novice ear, a man in a raspy voice talking poetry. Its also pretty dark. Not like your mother making you eat liver because its good for you,...maybe more like when you first learned to drink coffee black. Many ""adults"" I respect are wild about this artist so I have faith that his style is something I will appreciate if only on a very limited occasional basis."
4,He's your man.,"Other than his collections, this is my favorite Leonard Cohen album. The music is simple yet complex, the mood is sometimes dismal, sometimes sexy, the lyrics are poetry, and the voice is smooth and hypnotic. The songs ""The Future"" and ""Waiting For The Miracle"" are rivaled in greatness only by ""Closing Time"" and ""Anthem"". Those songs are all amazing even if in different ways. I feel the last three songs don't quite hold up, but they're still good. ""I'm Your Man"" and ""Various Positions"" are excellent albums too, but I ""Always"" look forward to ""The Future""."
5,Trust me this is awesome! I love it and im a 12 year old girl.,"It's a great toy, I wear mine every day. If you love pokemon or you know someone who loves pokemon,like me, BUY IT!!!!! It's worth the money. It tells the time and has two pieces of cardboard that are supposed to be ""apps"" that can be inserted into it. It also came with delicious candy. I LOVE IT!!!!!"
3,Okay,"this toy was okay. my son wanted a blue one, but could only get red. when we got it my son looked at it and only played with it for one day. i am not sure what to say about it. its okay."
2,Sweat band,I was expecting a 4 inch wide sweat band and when I got it this thing was huge. I had ordered it for a customer of mine but couldnt do anything with it.
5,perfect,I was exactly what I wanted. It was packaged flat which made them easy to personalize. They also shipped very quickly.
5,Great for Binocular fans...,"Dickinson is a master. He writes cleanly and clearly and has this knack of passing on his enthusiasm to the reader in his prose. But what I really enjoyed about the book is the way in which he encourages readers *not* to go out and buy a several-hundred-dollar telescope, favouring instead binoculars.The book is chock full of things to see for anyone with a decent pair of binocs. Combined with a chapter on how to do deep space photography, the book is endlessly useful for the novice right up to the hard-core back yard astronomer.The latest edition covers eclipses, comets and other things in the night sky until 2010.Mine is already well thumbed and I just got it last week."
5,excellent for anyone interested in astronomy,This book is superb. I am just getting into astronomy and this book really helps with a lot of good information without being overly technical. If you are thinking of getting into astronomy get this book first it might help keep you from making a mistake on your telescope or binocular purchase. Highly recommended
5,"An absolute must for your first astronomy, observing book","There are so many books out there but this one really gets you to the subjects you want to see with a small scope or binoculars. It's not over detailed but enough information to educate and entertain. Objects are easy to find with this book and lots of information as to what to look for BEFORE you buy a scope. Explains the differences and advantages of scopes etc. Planatey data is in depth for a beginner,as well."
4,Good for the beginner but quickly outgrown,"I read this book after about four months or so of actively observing with a telescope and found it very well-written but also quite basic. It's great if you're a rank beginner but you will likely outgrow it quickly. Once you get a firm handle on the basic concepts of amateur astronomy, I don't see why you would need this book except for lending it to others to familiarize them with what you're doing!Intermediate or experienced amateurs looking to learn more need not apply."
4,Excellent book for the those just starting out ...,"Great book for those that are looking for answers to amateur level questions. The equipment section is a good guide for making an equipment selection. Pictures are a nice revision from past editions. I gave it a 4 because of the limited star chart section. If the next revision would improve on this area, it would be 5 for me."
4,Great overview of amateur astronomy,"This is one of the first books I bought when I got my first telescope a couple years ago. It provides a nice overview of just about everything the beginning amateur astronomer needs to know to get going in this hobby. It has breif descriptions of the universe and the different type of objects found in it. It gives excellent tips to learning the sky - such as using your hands to measure distances (I use this every time I find M81 & M82). There's a brief discussion of astronomy equipment and how to buy it.Although I don't use this ""in the field"", it is a nice reference to have around the house. I typically pick it up to check on something about once a month..."
5,Great book for beginner or more advanced amateur,Great illustrations and a good overview of astronomy. I loved the chapter that describes our place in the universe by starting with a cube that just contains the earh and expanding it step by step until it encompasses the entire universe.
4,Good but not great.,"This is another one of Terence Dickinsons ""backyard astronomy"" books that is somewhat better than others of this particular ""genre"", but suffers by a somewhat superficial treatment of the practical aspects of the subject. The primary reason I purchased the book was for the 20 very good star charts contained. It was not until I started using these charts that I realized that many important Messier objects were not included!Although the pictures are wonderful , and very attractive , I buy books of this type for information--not to ""sell me"" on being an amateur astronomer. I don't need ""cheerleading"". There are other books available that offer somewhat more information than this one--so 4 stars (more like 3.5 stars)."
4,Great Book for Intermediate Flashers,"As a 14-year-old intermediate flasher, I found this book great for those of you who know the basics of flash (tweening, movie clips, etc.) but want to learn more about actionscripting. The beginning was great and very clear. You don't even really need to use the actual Flash program until halfway through the book where it reinforces what you've learned with workshops.It does become kind of slow near the end of the Foundation part, but picks up again when you reach the tutorials. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to move on to more advanced flashing."
4,Great for dancing with the one you love.,"""Mr. Man in the Moon"" has to be the all-time best song to dance to. Stirring and romantic at the same time. It's one of those rare songs that are great for two-stepping or three-stepping."
1,Not listed on Tissot website collections,"I am confused about this item, I was checking Tissot official website and i couldn't find it based on the item number Tissot prc 200 T17.1.516.33There is another model which looks exactly the same but in different strap color Tissot prc 200 T17.1.516.32, I realy can't understand what is thedifference and if they are the same why they are listed in different model numbers ? any help with that???"
3,The Legacy of Al Capone,"This book is a ""good read,"" breezy and covering a lot of ground. But the author is an embellisher, elaborating on stories from minor hoodlums and fellow reporters as if they are truth. Take his detailed account of Al Capone killing three men at a banquet. This page would be good for a novel, but the police and coroner's office never learned what happened, and there is no evidence that Capone was even in the Chicago area at the time. So read the book as entertainment, and do your research elsewhere."
5,i love this book.,I had this book when I was younger and absolutely loved it. Very whimsical and imaginative and fun. :]
3,a bit overrated,"I bought this card for 3 good reasons:1. Zero driver2. RAID migration without needing to re-create a volume3. Claimed performanceIt doesn't require driver because it emulates standard IO controller, which I think is a really good idea. When I put in my 160G single driver and migrate it to a raid-1 volume, it took me 2 good days (yes, 4x hours non-stop, and the machine is idle). So, performance-wise, it's a bit overrated. The mirror volume is just ~10% faster than when I have a single drive."
5,*****Un GROS 5 étoiles*****,"En premier de tout, pour vous laissez savoir que 2 téléfilms sont en boni avec ce coffret (Envers contre tous et Le retour du Chat)...car ceux qui on acheté les autre coffrets serie 1 - 2 et 3, on 4 téléfilms inclus dans ces coffret et il en existe 6 en tout comme vous le savez il y as déja un coffret juste pour les téléfilms, donc maintenant la collection est complete sans etres obligé d'acheter les téléfilms.Lance Et Compte La Reconquete en dvd est superbe!!!!pour revivre cet 10 épisodes qui font battre le coeur pour savoir ce qui s'en vien dans la prochaine série.Ce coffret est essenciels a la collection Lance et compte !!!!"
4,Works well,"I had originally tried the TwinLab - Choline Cocktail II with caffeine before trying this one and i loved it. This TwinLab - Choline Cocktail does not have caffeine and I can see a slight difference. (hence only 4 out of 5 stars) I like the extra boost I got with the caffine a lot better than without. I still got all the vitamins and felt great, I just didn't feel as alert as I did with the one with with caffeine. I will be buying the Choline Cocktail again, just the caffeinated version."
2,I'm Confused,"The book has a couple of good guides in it and for the most part I picked up some points, but the software instructions on how to use this RAVE engine is awful. They tell you to put it in win-cgi directory and thats it. Most people dont know what that dir. is or how to get there never mind loading software into it. If you like adventure this software is a mind twister."
4,great service fast delivery,great product came with a lot of paper it also came very fast with in a few days of ordering i would definitly order from again thanks
5,Great for the Fireplace Making,Great for making my Christmas Fireplace out of boxes wrapped with this paper. It is firm paper so it hold up well.
4,Great Band,"The band elements has produced several LP's over the last decade with ""Spirit River"" being my favorite. Blown away was actually a soudtrack for a surfing film. Thanks to the help of Bill Evans the sax player this CD has some great music.Great music for being on the beach. I don't think I will ever get bored with these tunes. All monster musicians."
4,BUY THIS ONE!,A cool and frist album of the Jackson5.Alot of good songs on here like ABC and 2-4-6-8.BUY IT NOW
4,Just a darn good temporarily life-escaping read..,"What's the true test of whether it's a good book or not? When you can't bear to put it down and you don't want it to end, it's a good book! Greeley has characters with whom you can identify, a plot that keeps you going and a setting that makes you long for those big old houses by a pristine lake on summer days uncomplicated by bumper to bumper traffic and air pollution. I read the other reviews and wonder if everybody is so uptight these days that they can't imagine just laying back under an oak tree and reading a good book - not a great book, not a great work of literature. Just a good book. Lighten up, get a life, smell the flowers and learn to love just a ""good"" book."
3,my review,"This book tells the story of a man and a woman and how they are able to join their love after missing out on their first chance.This book is an incredible love story, even though it is hard to follow for you are brought back and forth between present time and the past. Once you grow used to this switching, the book becomes very interesting and easy to read.The characters are very genuine and the feelings they have are vey real. The plot, even though you pretty much guess the outcome, keeps you glued until the very end!Good read and great fun."
4,"Not one of Fr. Greeley's best, but worth reading . . .","The story of Leo, ""Packy"" and Jane through two summers was moving and compelling. It reminded me that the decisions we make in our ""childhood"" often affect us throughout our entire lives. It is also a story of how love can overcome all obstacles and that ""old"" friends are the best. Fr. Greeley, has his finger on the pulse of what motivates people, including priests. His books remind us that even though the characters have chosen to follow God and be in his service, that they still have passions and feelings like the rest of us, and in fact, are really no different than the rest of us. Very comforting!"
3,A Wonderful Weekend Read!,"In looking for a book to read in the evenings, I came across ""Summer at the Lake"". I hadn't read anything by Greeley and decided to try it. I'm so glad I did! The story line was great - a little hard to follow with all the narrator changes - but well worth it!Now I can't wait to get my hands on some additional Greeley books. Keep up the good work Father Greeley!"
2,Very boring,"At first this seemed like it was going to be a good book, a love story with a bit of mystery thrown in. Then it just became very boring. One of the main characters seemed more interested in having sex with his first love than actually developing a relationship with her. Even his daughter told him she'd seen Jane naked at the gym, and he shouldn't let her get away----hardly your normal father/daughter chit-chat. Eventually I checked the author, and sure enough it was a man. None of the conversations in the book seemed real, and I could not relate to any of the characters. I never finished the book, it just didn't hold my attention."
2,"two men, one woman, not much else","A mysterious car accident claims two lives. One man witnesses it. Same man loves a woman who marries the driver (who was also in and survives the accident). A priest is also in love with the woman. Half way thru the book, nothing else has happened. 3/4 of the way thru the book nothing else has happened. Once in awhile they talk about the mystery surrounding the car crash. The mystery to me is why I'm still reading this book. It must be because the style is enjoyable. There sure isn't any plot. Greeley's style is definitely fun, but other than that I'm not sure what this book has to offer. Nice cover,tho."
5,Long Labor for Women Doctors,"I agree with others that this is a superb book. One clarification: Doctors of the Church are not ""appointed"" or ""named,"" they are ""recognized"" by the Vatican for having taught the Church entire new aspects of Christianity. History (time) can be key to recognizing the wisdom of these spiritual masters; often their genius was not appreciated in their own times. Especially if they were female! The first of these 33 Doctors were recognized in 1298; the first women were recognized in the 1970s. Three women are now Doctors of the Church. That's a long labor for any woman. Read all about them: you'll be glad you did."
5,The best - really need an update,"I agree with the other reviews: these ACCESS guides are by far the best for cities, and I am really sorry there isn't one more recent than 1999 for Santa Fe. I bought more recent guides for Santa Fe - ehh. The others are very limited in the scope of information."
1,Defective,Was hoping this would work for a plane trip i took with my toddler. Didn't work from the moment I opened the package.
3,ctm,I buy light up toys for my grandaughter that had strokes when she was 41/2 months old. This type of toy help children with brain damage recover some of their normal functions. it is also a great toy for autism children. this toy is too small and also you have to hold the button down all the timeand that is not very user friendly.
2,Slanted and dull read,"This book resembles two men with a vendetta over people with a solution. Using a lot and I mean a lot of statistics they turn the data to favor their arguments. If one school out of many supports their claim, that is the stat they use, ignoring the stronger evidence. The authors do not offer solutions beyond ""there should be changes made nation wide."" These are the same people who write the mellon report, so getting additional attention is their goal, over informing a reader."
5,Improvisation of strings...at it's most creative:,"In 1994, I was in a gift shop at the San Diego Zoo when I heard the music of this CD. I lingered for a long time; almost paralyzed with absorbing the music! It's international flavor and the way these musicians poor their heart and soul into their music was captivating!"
5,Toe tapping of a good time,"I play this CD every morning. It'll make you salsa around in your own room! Great CD, perfect for a dinner party!"
4,A must have for anybody that wish to share a quality time,"The cadence, the rythm, the mix of guitar and exotic sounds reminds me of my music. The violins, percusions, all express a sense of sensuality, not just the plain sexuality found in ""latin-wanna bees"". It is soothing but calls your dreams, does not let you fall asleep, it is not elevator commercial type, is vibrant and a very good mix. I am used to the remarked rythm of the music from South America, I am from Argentina, very European, basically Spanish lots of English and American influence."
5,Vietnam front row center,"Great lady, great book.This book tells a story about the war never before told. A must read.Book selling for 30/40 $$ on net, this price a big rip off."
2,too bad,"i saw these promising kids in santa fe a couple of years ago, i thought they really had something going for them; wow was i wrong. the melodies are jaded and the riffs are crap, mabye live shows is where they shine. i hear the gazz uses pro-tools, well good luck guys, i hope you go for it all."
3,Guide but not a teacher for TRIZ biginners,"40 Principles Extended Edition- it is good book for TRIZ beginners.The book is very rich in TRIZ examples & illustrations.It servers very well as a guide to TRIZ but falls short in teaching how to utilize TRIZ techniques.40 Principles Extended Edition can be read as extension to Genrich Altshuller's ""And Suddenly Inventor Appeared"" But ""40 Principles"" should not be the first TRIZ book beginner should read.Also the book suffers from translation problems at few places.Most important utility of this book is easy to use TRIZ contradiction matrix chart"
5,Best Introduction to Classical TRIZ,"This book is not useless. It is where many of us started. It is the place to begin learning TRIZ, even if more modern forms of TRIZ have been developed. It is also wonderful for children."
2,Hate It,"That which is Jazz is good music but, there are far too many vocal selections. I buy and listen to Jazz for the quiet times. I find most vocals contained on many Jazz CD's to be an intrusion. Were these vocal additives true Jazz vocals they would be fine.Jazz Lover"
3,JUST CHILLIN TOO,"NORMAN BROWN IS BASICALLY A GEORGE BENSON PRODIGY. UNFORTUNATELY IT'S THAT WAY BECAUSE GEORGE BENSON LIKES TO SING MORE THAN PLAY HIS GUITAR. NORMAN BROWN IS BASICALLY FOLLOWING SUITE. FOR SOME REASON OR ANOTHER GUITAR PLAYERS OF TODAY SEEM TO MARKET THEMSELVES AS VOCAL/GUITAR PLAYER.WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THE GOOD OLD DAYS WHEN JAZZ GUITAR PLAYERS WERE INSTRUMENTAL IN THEIR PLAYING AND NOT SINGING. IN MY OPINION NORMAN BROWN IS BASICALLY A RHYTHM AND BLUES GUITAR PLAYER, THAT'S IT WITH NOTHING SPECIAL IN HIS PLAYING."
4,"Stormin' Norman has put it all together once, again!!","Norman Brown paired with super producer Paul Brown has put out a smooth, sultry project any smooth jazz fan would appreciate. Starting with track # 2 ""Just Chillin'"" the title track, Brown & Brown depart from the usual Norman Brown 'scattin' to a mid tempo sound. This project features excellent contributions from the likes of Michael McDonald,Mikki Howard, Chante' Moore and new comer Debbie Nova all nice selections. My favorite is tract #9 ""In My Life"". Norman also includes another Janet Jackson tune""Let's Wait Awhile"". This CD is definitely worth the dough, get it and enjoy the quiet storm of Norman B....Sincerely,Kevin"
5,Been around for a minute and not going anywhere!,"He is one of my favorite jazz artist. From the very first one my mother was playing back some yrs ago I've been hooked. I think he is underratted, but he will get his just due! He needs to keep on what he is doing and don't change a thing."
3,Love it and hate it!,"I've had this vacuum for almost two years now. It is one of the best cleaning vacuums I've ever owned - great suction, great hose that's easy to use. I bought it because it you can't burn the motor out - if it begins to overheat, it shuts itself off. Problem is... it shuts off after 2 or 3 rooms. And beware - if you live outside of San Francisco there isn't really anywhere to take this vacuum for service. And there is no technical support over the phone or on the internet. I own A LOT of Bosch appliances and this is by far their worst ----To summarize:It is heavy - impossible on stairs.It is hard to tell when the bag is full.The bags are expensive and you must order online.It shuts off when overheated - can be good, can be annoying.Would I buy it again? Hard to say."
3,Good vacuum for the money.,"This is a good, powerful, compact machine that has a strong vacuum. Unfortunately, when it runs so powerfully, overtime, it will overheat causing the thermal fuse to shut the machine done until it cools off. Unlike other vacuum cleaners that ventilate the hot motor exhaust, this exhaust fis essentially ""covered"" by a filter and the top of the cannister. It was only a matter of time before this machine would have a melt down. The dust bag is not a small as others have described it (it is longer than most). However, the long term reliability of this machine is the main downside of this vacuum. I say it was good for the price: $89.00 close-out."
2,Horrible,"This vacuum has a lot of issues. First, the bag is really small and becomes detached very easily. This leaves a huge mess to clean up. I wonder how helpful the filtration is if the dirt doesn't even end up in the bag? The bags are also not easy to find and expensive. It is also hard to tell when the bag is full by the indicator. Second, it is really heavy. Third, when you are using the tools, the hose becomes detached. The hose is also too short. We have had this thing for less than two years and are now going to look at the Kenmore Progressive and the Dyson."
2,Too heavy,"We owned one of these for awhile. It was so heavy, just pushing it back and forth strained my back, never mind lifting it upstairs. So my husband took on the chore. (He'd picked it out to begin with). And it really did a great job on the carpets. But after a month or so, he hated it too, so he hired a housekeeper. She quit after a few weeks (maybe she had ""back problems""?)We bought another one, this time I picked it out. It's a Hoover Wind Tunnel, not sure of the model #, but it's great. Not self propelled, but acts like it, and does a great job on the carpets & flooring. Not heavy, either. Best advice: check the weight on these things along with the other info. No matter how good they are, or how many bells & whistles they have, it's no good if you can't use it.(The only problem I have now is ""no excuse"" to get me out of vacuuming!)"
4,Decent quality but size was a bit small.,"The pullover is well made. No issues so far. The only warning I would offer is the sizes are a bit small. My dog's measurements came in on the bottom of the range for her size but the pullover is still a bit tight.I would order this again, I just would get the next size up."
2,"Smikry, eh?","To Kimberly Heinrichs, reviewer for AmazonI was told to do the voiceover that way. So if it is smirky, do not blame the messenger.Frankly, I think this video - smirky voice of mine or no - is nifty for what it is.Karen Krizanovich"
5,The BEST CD Hillsong has EVER done!!!! It's GREAT!,This is the ver best cd of Hillsong's so far! The songs are ALL great! I listen to it at least once every day! The is the #1 CD I remcommend to ANYONE no matter who you are!
3,"Album itself is great, Amazon's digitizing is bad","Clear digital artifact in the middle of ""None but Jesus""... their response is to credit me back for the song, rather than release a new version.Pretty disappointed in the quality. 256 vbr shouldn't have this issue..."
3,"Bulky, not so great for traveling",I bought this primarily to carry cd's in the car so they wouldn't get scratched. But the case is awkward and hard to hide. The material seems strong and durable though and I am sure it will last a while... Might be good if you keep it one place for easy access to your cd's (like near your computer).
4,No More Wires!,"These headphones are great for anyone that likes to listen to music from one device on headphones, like an iPod that does not have Bluetooth, and quickly and seamlessly switch to an incoming call from another bluetooth enabled device (BlackBerry or standard phone with BlueTooth). It has a microphone boom too, so you just flip it open and start talking, with confidence that your music or audio file is paused right where you left it!"
5,Wonderful entertainment!,"Set in the vast open spaces of modern day Texas, True Colours revolves around the life of a small town veterinarian and the crippled daughter of the most hated man in Meridianville. The reader follows how these two very different people face several tough trials together, and through it all build a loving lasting relationship. The proud rich TJ Meridian draws the reader in as we watch her struggle with her inner demons and her attempts to clear her name in the town her father all but destroyed. With the help of gentle Dr. Mare Gillespie, who faces a family struggle of her own, TJ finds hope and possibly the miracle she needs to get rid of her inner demons forever. True Colours is the kind of book you want to read on a lazy afternoon, entertaining and satisfying at the same time. The characters of TJ and Mare stay with you long after the book is finished."
2,Not for all Ear sizes,PROS: good voice mic qualityCONS: not stable on small ears. not sure about average/larger ears.
5,Best Kata Book,"I truly enjoyed reading this book and I refer to it a lot in my studies of kendo kata. It provides a great deal of insight and history of the kendo kata, including some of esoteric understanding of the meanings of the kata."
3,EZ ON THE EARS,"Jaci Velasquez meets Cyndi Lauper. A little sticky at times. Never-the-less, Sophie is accessible to a wide variety of tastes. Exploring the continuim from spiritual, to pop, to symphonic, this effort is perfect for your CD alarm clock. Set it for 7AM Sleeping Beauty and enjoy the day!"
3,Whaler (Sophie B Hawkins),"I can't say that this CD is good or bad, because it isn't either. It had some songs that are really nice, pretty, and harmonic, like the type Jewel sings. Then it has some of a funkier nature, that you can really dance to. But some of the songs are just total losers. They just put you to sleep like lullabies. They say nothing, they mean nothing, and they are nothing, except junk. The songs you hear on the radio are only the best of her works, so even if you like one song, you should hear ALL of them before buying the CD. But I'm not saying it's all bad, because some of the songs on this CD are very cool and very pleasant."
5,"interesting album..not your average ""best of""","These aren't the original Sun or Columbia recordings, which ain't a bad thing at all! They seem to be from a period post Columbia in the late 60's or early 70's. Inveriably Columbia hits packages use the live Sunday Morning Coming Down, this one is a studio version with his touring band. Infact all of the classics are remade perhaps in an effort to give a new record company access to some of his most classic recordings. I bought this package because of the song A Thing Called Love, a song that hadn't appeared on any of the other Johnny Cash albums I have bought in the last while. I give this one five stars simply because of the novelty of having different versions of some of these songs."
5,Life Changing Book - Easy Read (3 Hours),"I was at a pivital point in my job and in my relationship and this book has changed my view of both of them. It's just so amazing I was given this book by the author's brother and I had waited 4 weeks to read it, and I couldn't of read it at a better time. I recommend this book to everyone. It will change the way you view love in all of your relationships and open your heart and soul to love like you never have before. Thank you for offering me this book it has been a life changing event for me!! ..."
1,Too many stories. No substance.,I did not find this book interesting or applicable. It is weak on a model and based on too much opinion and selective interpretations.
5,Ole Kipnis!,"What happens when you combine the incredible virtuosity of Kipnis, throw in a splash of stylished spanish harpsichord coposition, stir it well with a dash of phenomenal technique and a pinch of bravura? You get The Spanish Harpisichord! This is one of the finest recordings Maestro Kipnes truly ever recorded. It demonstrates the phenomenal mastery of interpretation he had in compositions (Scarlatti especially) He made the instrument come alive and sing! Buy this phenomenal cd! You will be very glad you did!"
1,Standard documentary masquerading as alternate history,"This movie is very misleadingly titled. There is no, ZERO, exploration of ""Vietnam in Kennedy had lived"" here. It's a standard documentary breezing through three years of history in a very cursory manner, adding no new insights and just barely touching on the tumultuous events of Kennedy's presidency. At the end the narrator says ""Of course, Kennedy might have done things differently."" Really? That's it? That's your whole counterfactual analysis? If you don't want to explore a historical ""what if,"" then call your movie something else next time!!"
1,"You are kidding, right?",What a ripoff? I just went to another site and priced a new Compaq with the following specs:SR2010NX AMD Sempron(tm) processor 3400+; DVD-ROM/CD-RW drive; 120GB hard drive; 512MB PC2-4200 DDR2 SDRAMGuess what? It's only $65 more then this refurb. Be careful what you pay for.
4,Interesting take.,"I did notice one error. In the second chapter, Goodrich starts to compare the stories of star-crossed lovers. She writes ""In each case one lover or both lovers die, but the heroine in each duo always dies in some sort of comedy of errors. Eurydice turns to look backwards into hell, and this triggers her relapse."" Only it was Orpheus in his haste to see Eurydice again who turned to look backwards causing Eurydice to disappear. Unless I am mistaken.."
4,Very funny!,"The account of a week in an ancestral Normandy farmhouse is very funny, but it may require some familiarity with neglected French country houses for the reader to get the full effect of Kilmer-s predictament. I laughed out loud all the way through this delightful book and enjoyed the writing style which evokes the ambiance of the setting very well. Sensory memory of apple orchards, damp linen sheets, goose poop, old books is magically brought forth in words. I enjoyed the self deprecating narrative of a hapless descendent of a beloved, but eccentric family trying to decide whther to ""throw himself(and his own generation)under the wheels of happiness"" as Christopher Fry would put it...and take possession of this house and it-s many stories."
2,It ain't Tuscany or Provence,"After rebuilding ancient houses with Mayle in Provence and Mayes and Mate' in Tuscany I was rather disappointed in a repetitious recital of the problems with the floor, the rain, the plumbing, and the flotsum and jetsam lying around the farm waiting to be decomposed or resurrected as some antique. I kept wanting them to get on with the building/restoration and the unique characters the Killmer's would have to deal with to restore the home."
2,not sure about this one (too big to return through the mail),The ironing board slants down toward the tip making it challenging to use. I would expect it to create a flat surface from which to iron. This makes me wonder if I have a defective version.
2,Polder Ironing Board,"I sent this ironing board back because the leg was bent/damaged. It was not damaged during the shipping process, it looked as if it came from the manufacturer that way."
1,Toy that grows Mold,"While this looks like a delightful toy and a great accompaniment to the Old MacDonald Song, be aware that this is a potential health hazzard. These animals are breeding grounds for mold. Little children love to squirt the water out into their mouths. Think about that water filled with mold that has been growing inside because there's no way to express all the water in it that collects. Think twice before buying this product for you little precious ones. It's a danger."
1,False Advertising,"This product says it comes with 5 toys, it does not. It comes with 4. The horse is no where to be found. I am disappointed."
1,Great until they fill with mould. Don't buy it!,"Don't buy it! Loved this toy - was a great bath toy to teach my daughter the animals. However, then they filled with black mould and it squeezed out into the bath when she played with them. Yes, you could clean them but it's a hassle. I now buy the foam letters (fantastic) and animals without holes in the bottom. They are easy to clean and no mould. I would NOT recommend this product AT ALL!"
3,You can get better for cheaper,"I bought this at last moment, and I regret doing so. While Amazon does have this item the cheapest, I see that there are better squirters for cheaper as well. My nephew just turned 2, and he was not interested at all. He squeezed a couple times and moved on to some fruit snacks...."
3,Read the fine print: this is an Amazon CD-R produced on demand,"I purchased this disc thinking that I would receive--as advertised--a Sony Classical Audio CD of Igor Kipnis. Instead I received an Amazon-manufactured CD-R disc with NO liner notes, NO recording information and incorrect track listings.The ""Product Details"" on the Amazon page for this item do not mention the fact that this disc is produced on demand nor that it is a CD-R. About halfway down the page, under ""Editorial Reviews,"" there is a single line, ""This product is manufactured on demand using CD-R recordable media."" While most newer CD players will have no problem playing the disc, many older players will not recognize the CD-R format. (My vintage 1989 Technics player does not.)The music itself is great (hence the three stars) but Amazon could surely do a better job at alerting customers that this is NOT the original release of this disc--it is a cheap, on demand substitute--surely not worth the price that Amazon is asking."
2,Anger attempts,"2 1/2Credit Converge for at least trying in inject this hardcore at times a with deeper melody and complexity, but for music fans outside the genre's interest this may just still end up just reiterating stereotypical thrash attack/banshee wail tendencies."
3,Too big for my space,"I liked the idea that this rack folded up and also drained properly, but when it arrived it was way too wide and tall for my countertop space. If you have overhanging cabinets, you will have only a few inches clearance. It makes the counter look crowded even when the rack is empty. Despite the sleek materials and fine design, it is too big and bulky when open unless you have a large wide countertop."
1,"Way too long, CONFUSING, and uninteresting","Although I am an avid supporter of the Head Start program and am very interested in learning more about its roots, this book is about 15 times too long, and is very scattered. It is very difficult to read and follow, and feels more like a burden to get through than an interesting piece of history. The basis of the book is great, and what they finally get around to saying has an empowering message, but it was just not written well and should have had a different author and been organized better."
3,disappointed,"Altho I like some of Franco's music, I was diasappointed. Maybe I would have liked him live. I bet he had a lot of charisma. I just did not enjoy this CD. The songs were too long and somewhat repetitive for my taste. I love the Mali sound and Salif and Babaa Maal and Rough guide to Mali and Guinea and Tuku but this one for me did not ring any bells for very long."
4,CD Aptly Subtitled: A Cinematic Jazz Experience,"The whole series could not be a more brilliant showcase of the dedication behind ""background"" music of 1960's & 1970's Italian movies - that just because they are ""scores"" does NOT mean they can't be brilliant on their own as: easy listening, bossa nova, 60's spy themes, Class A jazz tracks, dance chill, or as fun lounge tracks.Keep in mind that this Volume - Six - does mostly sound like jazz soundtrack scores - they are all excellent jazz tracks but depending on your tastes, they sound right at home in a Mannix episode or from a Dirty Harry movie - they are brassy with trumpets puncturing the track right when you ... well, most expect it :-) ... as any good 1970's jazzy detective movie score should. These are probably not tracks you'd slip into a mix CD or want to hear everyday - uless of course, you do a lot of food chases and jumping hilly streets in a 1973 Dodge Monaco ... excellent but not as versatile or fun as the others in the series."
1,Zorba feedback,"I thought I was ordering the Zorba musical but instead I received a ballet performance with no speech. I recently found the Zorba musical from another site for 12.95. I am disappointed with your advertising of this product.Thank You,Robert E. Feldman, M.D"
1,Why do DVD producers so often give us a hack & slice job?,"Well, here's another great film to avoid, avoid, avoid.Zorba the Greek is a film from 1964, not 1990. It was filmed in 1.85:1 widescreen. You want to buy a butchered version in which half the film has been hacked away? Go ahead. We all know that ""full"" screen is a marketing lie: a ""full"" screen is whatever aspect the film was originally. The 1.33:1 mutilation isn't ""full"" screen in any sense of the term.Don't buy this turkey. Wait until a responsible DVD producer gives you at least a 16:9 version. Giving money to the people who deliberately mutilate films only encourages them -- this is only a ploy to get your money for the butchered version and then get your money again when the film as the director intended it is released."
2,WAY too big,"The way this apron is cut, it totally falls off of my 4 year old. I can't imagine this working for any kid under the age of 10."
4,My daughter loved it.,"The apron was awesome as my daughter tells me. It has pockets, colorful, and easy to put on. She started to wear it everywhere, naturally I had to put a stop to that. So from my daughter ""awesome"", I recommend it."
5,Alex Toys My Super Art Apron,Just perfect for my 2+ year old grand daughter. What more can I say about the product. She was impressed too.
5,Love it!,"It's cute, it has pockets, it protects clothes, definitely recommend it! IT is a little toooo big for my three year old, but that just means it will last for a long time! It still covers most of his clothes, so it's not a complaint."
5,Great for crafty kids,"According to my ""crafty little kid"" this Alex apron is just the greatest to hold all her ""stuff"" and keeps her clean.Her Mommie also told me that she too likes it! Amazon always has the answer when I a need great present."
5,Great purchase.,I am very happy with this book. I love that it is only pictures so I can explain to my [..]about the new baby in my way. He loves it too and I think it is getting him excited for his new brother.
4,My New Baby (New Baby Series),I bought this book for my 15 month old grandson for Christmas. He has a new baby brother that is due on January 27th. My husband thought the book made him feel bad because he isn't able to do the things the older child in the book can do. He'll be able to do them some day and I don't regret buying the book for him. I like the idea of being a picture book so you can use your own words to describe what is happening and adapt it to your own family.
5,Great book for preparing a toddler for new baby!,"I purchased 4 books along this theme to help prepare my 2 year old son for the impending birth of our daughter. This one is hands down our favorite. It's the only one he actually asks to have ""read"" to him. It doesn't have any words, but each picture lends itself to discussing different baby-related situations. From the baby shower, to the baby crying and nursing and taking the baby out for a walk. On each page the older sibling is portrayed in a an important role, helping to unwrap presents, helping to prepare dinner, helping by holding a toy for the baby. It's great!!"
2,A Picture Book,"I bought this and ""Waiting for Baby"" for my son when I was expecting his first sibling. I was unhappily surprised to find they did not have words, just pictures. That definitely should be part of the product description.It isn't too hard to make up a story, but if I would have known it was lacking words I never would have bought it."
2,Disappointed,I was disappointed that the book was only pictures and that there was nothing to read to my toddler.
2,Not my favorite,"My son, 2 1/2, seemed to enjoy this book but I thought it was kinda babyish for him though the manufacture states for preschoolers."
1,Disappointing!! This book has no words!,"I was very disappointed with this book. Unfortunately I purchased ""Waiting for Baby"" in the same order but have not received it yet. The product description does not state that it is only a picture book."
3,OK...,"OK so I'm one of the people that didn't read the description well and was shocked to see no words. Isn't a book by definition something you READ? I would call it a picture book or something like that otherwise, but anyways. Cute book just not into the ""lack of words"" thing. I understand that you can use it to explain to your child what's happening, but I bought this for my niece who's expecting a sibling and I just am not into how blah this book is.... but my own fault for not reading the description better!"
3,new baby in the house,"cute book but i would suggest that it is better if the new mother is nursing. my almost two old grandson could not understand what the new baby was doing with mommie while daddy was cooking and doing all the things his mommie does. the nursing mother thing threw him and he really does not like this book too much, since he can not relate to the story."
2,no words,"Not to thrilled with this purchase. No words and there is a breastfeeding mom on a couple of pages. Fine but, not what we were looking for to introduce our 2 year old to a new child."
3,Ok.,I bought this book as a gift for my friend's little girl. I did'nt realize there were no words. The pictures are nice.
5,"No words, great pictures--still a good ""read""","This book does a fine job of illustrating for a toddler his/her role as a big sibling when a new baby is expected. It shows the toddler helping with the new baby, being independent while mom and dad care for baby, sleeping in a big boy bed, and being present while mom nurses baby. It was a great fit for our family, and our son, who was 27 months when his brother arrived, enjoyed reading it with me and talking about the baby."
5,Respectful and Realistic,"We loved that this book depicted relationships in a respectful and realistic manner. The older boy helps out Mum and Dad, plays alone with baby, has time playing quietly by himself and at the end of the day when baby is in bed, has some quality time alone with Mum and Dad reading a book. We also liked how Dad is actively involved eg he cooks dinner while Mum nurses baby.Although it had no words, our 1.5 year old twins loved pointing out and naming objects that they knew and of telling us what was happening. For example:""poo"" (baby getting nappy/diaper changed)""wah, wah"" (baby crying)""shh"" (baby sleeping)We got a number of new baby books, some good some not. This is one that we'd recommend."
4,"No words, but great concepts","This book was a little hard to read with the lack of words! However in looking at the pictures we found lots to talk about including Daddy cooking, the baby sleeping and having to be quiet and breastfeeding (not in our other big brother type books). I find my son interacting more with this book than the other ones which he just listens to. Although he doesn't choose to read this book as often as the others I find it gives me more of a reading on how he's understanding this whole new baby experience."
2,Where are the words?,"I decided on this book based on the reviews. But I don't recall any of them mentioning that there are NO WORDS in this book. The pictures are cute and if you're a keen storyteller then I'd say this is the perfect book for you. I however, would rather someone else provide the words since my tired brain isn't feeling creative lately. My son doesn't touch this book but he loves the one his Nana bought for him, which is the other book I was considering...""I'm a Big Brother Now."" That's the book I recommend you buy."
3,cute book,Cute pictures- but no words- the price was right but next time I will do more research about the book-
2,Disappointed because there is no text on pages,"This book is wonderfully illustrated and shows important scenes like mommy's doctor appointments, buying/preparing for baby at home, decorating baby's room, seeing mommy and daddy leave for hospital while older child stays at home and finally on the back cover meeting baby in hospital but it has no words. I assume the lack of text is meant to encourage discussion between parent and child but explanations aren't holding my 18 month old boy's attention. Maybe it would be better for an older child who can participate in the discussion. For now I can hope that some connections are being made in his mind."
3,"Great Graphics, No Text to Read","Although I really like the illustrations of this book, there is no text. I guess I missed that when I bought it. We make up the stories as we go along, but I would have preferred something to read to my 2-year-old."
2,I didn't like this book,"I ordered this book not knowing that there weren't any words and so I was quite surprised to receive a book with only pictures. And although the pictures are okay, I found each page to be very ""busy"". Overall, it was not what I was looking for."
4,Great book; small issue,"This is a great picture book! My almost 3 year old really enjoyed reading it, and I think it helped him to understand what might change with a new baby in the house. We now look at it using the new baby's name. I love that it shows breastfeeding, but my one small issue is that it shows both kids sucking their thumbs. My older son is a thumb sucker, and I worry that this is encouraging him.Otherwise, a fantastic picture book!"
2,new baby book,"i bought this book for my 2 year 4 month old grandson. although he loves books, (some can keep his attention for 20 minutes at at a time) he barely glanced at this one. there was very little of interest in it. disappointing."
4,absolutely indispensible,"This collection contains the most important sections of those judgements of the International Court of Justice and its predecessor which are crucial in an understanding of international law. Decisions such as that with respect to the paramilitary activities in Nicaragua, the East Timor case, and of course the decisions of South West Africa and Barcelona Traction are included. This book should be a starting point for teams participating in Jessup international moot court competition, as well as any research student. It is an indispensible aspect of any iternational law library."
3,Good but could be better,"I love Olivia but the new cd is not catchy like her older stuff was. I liked the catchy stuff better. And why re-release ""I Honestly Love You""?? I liked it the first time she recorded it."
2,Back With A Flop,"I'm a huge Olivia fan, but promoting this album as representative of the ""mellow"" Olivia is not ""truth in advertising"". The songs on this album are barely passable, with the notable exception of the remake of ""I Honestly Love You""--which in my view is a genuine achievement. As someone who feels her best material was from her ""country"" era,this material doesn't come close to the material she did in her original ""country"" period. The only song I liked was the ""I Honestly Love You"" remake, which I suggest be bought as a single. I do believe Olivia is still capable of replicating the quality found in her original 'country' period, but this album doesn't do it. I await the day when such material appears."
5,A Class Act,"Olivia is definetly ""Back With A Heart"" with this cd that shows she is still as talented as ever. While radio and many fans have basically ignored this CD the final product is one of her best. The title track, ""Love Is A Gift"" and ""Under My Skin"" are among the highlights. While Livvy failed to score a radio hit both ""IHLY"" and ""Precious Love"" were CMT hits showing that country fans have a much wider mind than many country DJS. Olivia faces the problem of not exactly fitting any format. County fans(some)think she is too pop and pop fans(some) have failed to grow with Olivia and want Physical Part 2. Thankfully, Olivia has the good taste to simply sing from her heart and the results are a classy album. Pick up a copy today! Although not released in the U.S. GAIA also is a great look at this very talented lady today."
4,olivia's come full circle,"after bending herself out of shape in the 80's trying to be a sex kitten, olivia's come full circle. save for 1 track (fight for our love) this set is worth my time (and money)."
2,"She may be back, but....","After reading the variety of reviews here I decided to check this CD out before purchasing it. I went to Borders and listened to long clips of every song before making a decision. I was extremely disappointed. I don't know how to describe it except ""blah."" I found it very slow, very drawn out and very boring. It left me with a feeling of ""I can't wait for this to be over."" I couldn't bring myself to spend even $11.98 on it. I was hoping for a more upbeat CD in music and lyrics."
3,Great title song but....,"Back with a heart marks the return to country music for Olivia and a welcome comeback to music after some health problems.The title song is superb but somehow the rest of the cd fails.The voice is not as good as ever,probably because it's still in recovery but the songs fail too.Still, it's a pleasure to hear again Olivia back to her country roots."
2,THIS IS NOT NO COUNTRY!,"Not much to say. I think I finally have to understand that even though I love her in person and all, this CD truly was a mess. First of all, it is on a country label. It is not meant to be called country and I say it is a sin that it is under MCA Nashville. All I gotta say is, she should have stuck to pop. I give this album 2 stars still, because the songs are somewhat decent. ""Love Is A Gift"" is pretty good, as well as ""Under My Skin"". But I guess GAIA will always be my fave CD and genre of Olivia Newton-John."
4,Great learning book,"Had to get the book for a programming class and actually enjoyed reading it. Easy to understand, well written, need more textbooks like this for college students.Had a poor index and no class library in the back :("
1,More Fictitious than fact,"Didn't buy it, skimmed int in the store. So glad I didn't waste money on this trash. I honestly felt like I was reading through a manual for a LARPing community.She also never really stopped talking about herself and her 'mystical, magical power'. Geez."
1,"Worst in a Long, Long While","It reeks of role playing games taken way too seriously but is so internally inconsistent as to be gibberish. The author herself in writing her self-aggrandizing work betrays the very code of ethics she espouses (and apparently made up after playing Vampire: the Masquerade) when she writes ""This lifestyle is private and sacred. Respect it as such. Do not make a sideshow of yourself."""
5,Throws light on a dark subject!,"Much is revealed here that really gives ALL who delve into this book an insight into something that many fear. What I quickly saw was that anyone who is a practitioner of Magick can benefit from the techniques that are provided with much elaboration and detail. Michelle goes out on a limb and reveals alot about herself and others like her, so a hats off to honesty, and bravery.What I feel is that I no longer have a feeling of alienation and seperateness from this subject, thanks to this book. Actually the term ""vampire"" may even be outdated, although another term is not substituted. You may not be a vampire, or interested in vampires, but like any controversial or ""dark"" subject, once the time is taken to fully explore the contents of this, you will no longer be ignorant of what it means to be a real vampire."
1,Pure Nonsense,"I can't imagine why anyone in the world would want to be a vampire. A psychic vampire is a parasite. To think that someone would actualy want to ""feed"" off of another human being is not only unnecessary, but comical. I guess if you want to be a parasite then buy this ""book""."
5,"This is a great tool for energy work, developing any abilities and...","This is a wonderful guide and workbook of sorts for developing our abilities, honing & refining our skills. The word ""vampire"" threw me at first but her definition made perfect sense. I didn't care about reading another vampire saga but this is no where even close. This is a book you can read casually, just for info, it can be used as a handbook, or guide, in working with your own energy and exercises to fine-tune any abilities. It also is very clear about how one should conduct themselves where the energy of others is concerned. It teaches techniques to protect ourselves, encourages self-respect and insists on self-control. This is a book I have read more than once and will continue to read, using it as a workbook to refine my abilities and hone my skills. It is well-written, has great back stories and is so hard to put down..she is a gifted author and I gladly recommend reading all of her books as I have done."
5,Joe Bonomo Barbell Training {including Dumbells],"This book is the best barbell\dumbell courses I have ever seen.I have them all York, Weider, Healthways,DP,Billard and I like this one the best.It tells speed of movements, breathing,order of movements and tons of other information.It is an older courseand very rare but worth the time to find and the cost to purchaseTo bad they don't reprint it so everyone can get this excellentcourse.Well worth the price at any price."
3,Interesting,A fun read... Has it's strange moments. I always love to read the origin of movies. Suits a young audience: Teens to early twenties. A Unique writing style is shared between the two authors and they play off one another well.
3,Definitely a teen romance,"I sat down and read it in one night, had a good time reading it but I wouldn't pick it up again."
3,Cute love story,One night.. Soo much happens! Quick read.. I read it in 2 days. Now to watch the movie! Can't wait Love the story and love Rachel Cohn.
2,"The Movie May be PG-13, This Book is Not.","Take two very emotional, talkative, overly analytical 18 year olds... Have them each drink a case of Mt. Dew (not part of the story, but the same result)... Then have them write a story.That is what this book felt like.Oh - and challenge them to use the f-bomb 350 times in less than 200 pages. And the make-out and near sex scenes - yikes again! Way too much detail for a young adult book.I enjoyedDash & Lily's Book of Dares. I gave that one five stars.This book got two stars from me because I enjoyed the vivid scenery. The rest of it - yuck. I need an aspirin."
4,One Night in NYC is a Stand-Out,"Ink and Page's Quick & Dirty ReviewRating: 4Best Thang `Bout It: Easy. The writing. No - how the MCs are captured. So realistic. So, yeah - the writing. And NYC. And the music talk.I'm Cranky Because: I think Michael Cera is the cat's pjs, but he's more quirky adorable, pat-him-on-the-head-but-prob-not-date-him kind of cute. Of course, while reading, I kept picturing him instead of MY idea of Nick. That's why you need to read the book first. But I didn't know the book existed, and the movie was on the T&V;, so there you go. All my fault. (As an aside: does anyone else now see Taran Killam in your mind's eye instead of the actual Michael Cera?)Should You?: Absolutely.This book was read in place of Beta which will be published on October 16, 2012 by Hyperion Book CH. Nick & Norah's Infinite Playlist was published on May 23, 2006 by Knopf Books for Young Readers.Genre: Young Adult Fiction Contemporary Romance Kick-AssAges: 14 and up"
5,Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist,"I'll start this off by saying that yes, this book says the f-word A LOT and yes, it's kind of mature. But then I will go on by saying that this book made me laugh out loud. Which is good for me, because any book that has my attention like that is officially a Good Book. If a book makes me laugh it doesn't mean it's The Best Book Ever, but it will definitely be a Good or Great Book.And now I'll say that it was, in my opinion, a Great Book. It just had this feeling to it, where everything was so interesting and different and I could really tell that Rachel Cohn and David Levithan are different people and yet they still sound like they belong writing together.Still, I say this book is meant for 9th or 10th grade up, like the above summary says, because it is mature and I also don't want anyone getting mad at me for not mentioning that in my review, or if someone went to go read the book and were pleasantly surprised..."
1,Waste of my Time,This book was VERY disapointing. The plotline had so much potential and it all just fell flat. To make this easier here's a list of why I hated it.1. I did not take to the constant swearing. There was major swearing every third scentence and I felt like it took away from trying to feel for the characters. (If Norah's a good girl why isn't she portrayed as one.2. Aside from the swearing there were a lot of really r rated things going on that didn't make for a good story.3.The discription of the book made it sound SO much better than it actually was.4.The whole thing was confusing. If Norah's parents have been married forever than why does she talk about her step monster in the begining of the book.5. I know this book was written by two people but I have seen books about more than one character written by one author that distinguished characters more. It was sad that Nick and Norah sounded like the same person.And that is just my top five...
5,"Edgy, honest, fun.","Stellar, awesome, inventive, and all character. I admittedly got pulled into reading it after digging the movie, not the other way around. If you want to live in someone's moment, jagged edges and all, this is your tale. Self-involved, melodramatic, self-conscious, exhilarating, hopeful, pulsing, raging.It's hard to explain what this book is which is part of why I like it so much. A back and forth collection of interior monologues from Nick, then Norah, tell one night of meeting, connecting, and band hopping in NYC. Definitely one of the best boy-meets-girl I've read in quite some time. Heartfully recommend."
4,"A short, sharp glimpse at Infinite","Much like Larry Doyle's novel ""I Love You, Beth Cooper,"" this book deals with one night on the teenage scene fueled by sharp dialogue and funny situations that sit on the edge of believable. The authors alternate chapters for each character's point of view, revealing the hidden reluctance and false assumptions that occur in the beginning of all relationships. A YA novel not just for the young."
3,A Short and Fun Read!,"Problem: Nick spots his ex-girlfriend heading towards him with a new guyResponse: Asks the girl next to him to be his girlfriend for five minutesResult: An unexpected, fun filled night in New York CityI just had to pick this up when I heard that the story took place over one night! The story was told in alternating chapters full of hilarious and sarcastic commentary from Nick and Norah. They were both battling heart breaks when they bumped into each other at a show. My favorite part of the story was how music played such an important role. Throughout the night, Nick and Norah constantly made references, tossed out song lyrics, and even chased after one of their favorite bands for a secret show.This was a short and fun read that made me laugh throughout the whole night."
2,Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist,At some points there are really graphic scenes. I wouldn't recommend this to young children. Mostly should be read by high schoolers and teens.
2,Recycled,"I have read both Gingerbread and Boy Meets Boy and completely enjoyed them both tremendously. I had a hard time enjoying this book. First, the character of Norah is insecure to the point of being annoying. Second, Nick's character was not fully developed and I felt little attachment to him as a reader. Third, some of the minor characters were complete cliches--the party hard cute gay boy, the promiscuous friend etc...Also, the ending (I will not spoil it for people who wish to read the book) is completely a cheat. Not because of the end, but how cunning Nick's acts towards Norah. You don't want or believe that these two belong together."
2,Not for teenagers,My daughter wanted to read this book. I picked it up one day to read and was astounded at the number of f**k curses in this book and the extreme sexual references. How this book and these authors (who are supposedly for teens) could be published is beyond me.
5,What are you waiting for!?,"Ormandy in Prokofiev, with his Philadelphians, offers a thrilling performance of both works. Indeed, the performance of #1 has to be one of the most enjoyable I've ever come across. #5 is no less well done; in fact, it is the primary reason I recommend that you lay down the 7 lousy bucks and treat yourself to some exquisite, exciting, tonally-alluring and virtuosic music-making."
5,Great Gift,I recently gave this book as a shower gift for my niece who adopted a 2 1/2 year old little girl. Everyone at the shower read the entire book and just loved it! Michelle says Austina always brings this book to her during reading time. I will remember this book for future adoptive families.
2,Disappointed,"Our red-haired, blue-eyed son and his similarly endowed wife are in the process of pursuing a Vietnamese adoption, so the title of this book attracted my attention immediately. I was quite disappointed in it, however, because it's entirely too specific in listing the ways in which parent and child who do not look alike are still similar. I was especially put off by the religious portion...my son and his wife are not religious, nor are we, but the book assumes that the parent adopting the child is and will pass on that tradition. The book is useless for us and will be passed on to the library sale. The other book I purchased, ""The Red Blanket"", is vastly superior, both in text and illustration."
3,"Nice message, but...","My 4 year old adopted Chinese daughter has no idea what this book is trying to say. It dances around the truth (she is not our biological child and looks nothing like us) by saying things like ""I don't have your eyes, but I have your sense of humor."" My daughter will say things like ""I have my own eyes and you have your own eyes."" I should also note that I am adopted as well and I agree with my daughter -- we all have our own eyes, hair, sense of humor, etc. In fact, I am having a hard time finding a book that addresses adoption in very direct terms."
3,"Sweet Book, Nice Message",This was a very nice book about different races and adoption. NOT the best book I have seen. It lacked something that I cannot put my finger on.
2,Don't have to be--or think--the same to be a family,"The message that we don't have to look alike to be a family is a good one, as is the idea of finding other commonalities. But the specificity of the types of sameness ""in our hearts"" in this book--and even the implied requirement for sameness (""in our hearts we are the same"")--make it miss the mark. What makes us a family is our parental love for and commitment to our child, and consequently our child's love for us (the latter is welcomed but not required). I don't want to teach my daughter that if she thinks differently from me or chooses a different spiritual path, etc., then she won't be my daughter. My love for her and commitment to her are unconditional, not based on her feeling or thinking like me.Ultimately a well meaning but misguided attempt that sends the wrong message."
5,Amazing book!!!,I love this book a friend recommend it to me and I bought it for my classroom. It is a different way to teach and make children understand the adoption process.
2,"nice text, weird illustrations","This book is chock full of really lovely sentiment regarding how similar we are ... on the inside...(gross paraphrase)Unfortunately, the illustrations are freakish. I don't know how else to characterize them. My kids were totally turned off by the way people looked in the story. The mom on the first page looks like one of those dolls with the blue eyes that open and close.On the other hand, I could see that my 10 year old was intrigued by the text. She couldn't stand the illustrations, though."
5,Absolutely loved this book.,"This is one of the best childrens' books I have ever read. I think its essential for children who have been adopted and its a great book for children not adopted because it gives children at a young age the idea of how special adoption really is. What I loved about the book is that it doesn't just talk about eyes, but legs, and nose...etc. The child is saying in the book I didn't get my features from you but look at all the important things I got from you such as your way of looking at life. It was beautiful, just beautiful. A must have."
4,Helpful for Lots of Different Families,"Great book for children who look physically different than their families--bio or adoptive (don't be fooled by the cover, by the way. Lots of diversity represented, not just Asian). The illustrations aren't my favorite, but the text is simple and easy to read. And, the message is a good one for my toddler as well as her older siblings (bio kids)--though there are many ways we look different, there are just as many ways we are the same. This book helps families celebrate their differences while also emphasizing that our hearts are what matter most.If you want to read more reviews of adoption themed kids books, visit the 2/22/12 post on my blog www(dot)myoverthinking(dot)com"
3,Funny but not that useful,"You can find really funny expressions and you can have great time while reading and retrieving this book. But when I used some of those phrases, my American friends asked me where did I hear those 'ancient' phrases! Obviously there are a lot of phrases that are out of date. This book is for fun but not for use."
2,Mini cannot be overstated,"What is missing from the photo is someone's hand or a book so that we can see the scale of this pan set. The pan set is about the size of my hand. The dimensions are equally misleading as the 12 x 12 x 12 is the CUMULATIVE measurement of all three tiers. My ruler is measuring this as 2 in (height) by 4"" diameter for the largest tin.It is a cute tin and would make a cute cake for a child but what bothers me is that the discription and photo is misleading. I wonder how many people purchased this item thinking it was something that it was not."
5,MINI CAKE!,"it irritates me when people give perfectly good products bad reviews because they do not understand the product description. I honestly don't see how the term ""mini"" could be confusing, but apparently there are those out there who do. As a professional baker, I can confidently say that this is a fine product and I would recommend it to anyone."
1,Tooo small,"The product is soo small that it will fit in your palm, the manufacturer should give the correct capacity of each pan. The picture shown is misleading. I'm going to return it."
1,not at all what I expected,When I was looking at this product online the one in the picure was regular sized but when I recived mine it was downwright puny!
2,cake pans,"I should have looked closer at the size when I bought these...Much smaller than expected, and hard to work with."
1,Cocoa Butter Lotion,"The cocoa butter lotion smells aweful! I was expecting it to smell like the cocoa butter i use for my deep tissue massages at work. I was wrong, i dont know if it was becasue it froze during shiping, but i bought 2 and they both smell aweful."
4,One of the best and most exciting ND mysteries,"In this Nancy Drew Mystery Story, Nancy goes to her boyfriend Ned Nickerson's university with her friends Bess Marvin (a petite, boy-crazy blonde) and George Fayne (Bess's completely opposite cousin--actually a girl, who is sporty and athletic). They are going to be on Ned's fraternity's team in an annual 'scavenger hunt' called The Clues Challenge, but things start to go wrong for their team from the beginning--is someone from another team sabotaging them, or is it part of something deeper...and more mysterious yet. To paraphrase Nancy, 'I'm sure you'll find out!'"
4,Good overview,"In an effort to cover a wide spectrum of time and events, this DVD is a little thin in spots. Understanding that it is an overview, makes this more appreciated."
4,Good history of Israel's fight for survival,"If you are looking to figure out Israel's miraculous survival through the centuries, looking into the recent history of their reemergence as a nation with films like this can help a person understand that they are truly ""God's Chosen People""."
3,good but not the best,"I bought this machine from Wal-mark online a couple of months ago. I used it almost every other day. It is quite noisy when grinding beans. I have to switch my making time from morning to evening. It generally works fine in making the milk. However, the machine is not well built (I always have my concerns about the quality of soy milk makers on market). I've already seen two long cracks at the bottom plastic support, and the deformation of the micro-filter.Cleaning the maker is not easy. There are some areas that cannot be reached. Be vary careful about the blade. You can be cut by the blade.Sunpentown Soy Milk Maker"
2,broke on several levels,"Worked a total of seven times. It said you could use raw beans so i did; the result was a tear in the micro-filter - bummer. After that, there were always little bits of akara in my soymilk. Even worse, after the seventh usage it stopped working and just beeps randomly when plugged in. Not recommended at all. Giving it two stars instead of one because for those seven uses it was a heck of a lot easier than making the soy milk by hand.Low quality product. Also i believe this is the exact same product as a Q'Tessence QT400 soymilk maker.!!!-greg"
1,Messy after a year or so,"It was working fine but after a year or so of using it, the soybean mixture began to burst out from the vent. It's during one of the grinding phases and the bursts of grinding sending the mixture out through the vent like Mount St. Helen. After the eruption, the whole pot is wasted and leaving a messy kitchen for me to clean up..."
4,QUITE GOOD!,"the real question is not why ""a musician has to resort to a cheesy soft-porn cover to get people to buy their album"" but why does someone of Mr. DiMeola's obvious talents have to practically beg record companies to pay attention to him? Is it because he plays a real instrument and doesn't go on stage with 10 dancers doing their overly choreographed and tired moves? Is it because he employs a talented drummer like Omar Hakim and doesn't resort to sampled and/or looped drum tracks? Is it because record companies think all the world needs are 3 minute pop tunes you can dance to, regardless of how mindless they are? That a musician of DiMeola's talents had such a difficult time says more about how clueless and outright stupid so many record execs really are. If I had a record label and Al came to me signing him would be a no-brainer. Yeah, but what do I know?!Just get this already!www.electriceyes.us"
5,Production !!!,"This album if listened to closely has tons of production .If listened to late at night ,no one around and in the dark,takes you on an incrediable journey. Thank you everyone who had a hand in this one."
1,kiss off,"The title and the cheesy cover of this cd should tip off the listener as to what Al is all about here--technically accomplished playing that makes no attempt to connect with the listener or offer anything in the way of heartfelt emotion. This lifeless work is only a pale shadow of the Dimeola of old. Like that model on the cover, he's just here for the money."
1,Don't be fooled by the picture,"I bought several tapestries before, all of great quality. This however is by far the lowest quality tapestry i've seen. What I received resembles little of the picture. The size is about half of what it should be, so it's small - it is very thin, and the colors are very weak, with much more white spacing then in the picture. This is not at all what i was expecting and should've been a lot better for the price."
2,'Outside Belongings': too much of an insider's musing on her identity.,I realised that I've probably bought this and in fact did not need it . Focuses on gay identity and the Quebec context making it very specific and decidedly autobigraphical in character - also dated . May sell it back to Amazon if I can't find a friend who'd like it!
5,Golf Course Design Textbook,A must for students of golf course architecture. A remarkable book.Geoff Shackelford
2,NOT A GOOD PREPARATION FOR THE GRE ECONOMICS TEST,"There are errors in this book, and the focus is off. The writers don't seem to have a good understanding of the GRE economics test, or the desire to find out. I think this book is sold simply by virtue of its title and the absence of any other test guide on the market. The best preparation is to use a good summary of the relevant economics concepts (which I had to prepare myself since I couldn't find any other GRE economics guidebook) and to practise on the actual test that ETS has put out. This approach served me well. Feel free to e-mail me at radagrawal@hotmail.com if you have any further questions."
3,Wasn't what I expected,The duck is just as hardy as you would expect a rubber duck to be. The dome over the head is an entirely different story. It is a rather weak piece of plastic that is not attached to the duck at all. Overall it is an OK product just wasn't what I expected.
3,Space Duck,"the duck is great, but the duck's helmet is very chinsy, i would say that this one is definitely for decorative purposes only, a disappointment given BUD's usual quality"
2,Didnt work for my 5month old,My 5 month old fights her sleep pretty bad so i was hoping this would ease her into sleep. it didnt work. the music is good but it doesnt put the baby to sleep.
1,Not very sturdy,"My two and a half year old daughter really enjoys playing with her stroller, but it the back where you can lay the baby down or sit up is completely broken. It is just made of cardboard and does not stay in the sitting position. I would recommend that a person keeps looking for a more toddler friendly stroller."
2,Not all that...,"I purchased the ""you and me"" stroller for my four year old grand daughter to have for her ""twin babies"". First of all, it was much too small for her to use, but may serve a 2 year old ok. Secondly, when she went to put one of the dolls in the seat on the back of the handle, the weight of the doll made the stroller tip over backwards. The doll was ""Miracle Baby"" by Mattel. I purchased her a set of smaller and lighter twin babies and they did very well in the stroller. Although my grand daughter wanted a twin doll stroller very badly and was excited when it arrived, she doesn't play with it like I thought she would, I assume, from the frustration of it tipping over backwards when she first began playing with it with her Miracle Baby ""twins"". I would not purchase it again for anyone else. It is very cute though and does well with very small light baby dolls. I wouldn't suggest a doll over 15 inches tall for this stroller."
3,"cute,small and poorly designed",My almost two year old received this as a gift for Christmas. There were no instructions for assembly in the box and the back wheels do not just snap on like the front ones. I exchanged it for another one and had the same problem- no instructions and back wheels wouldn't stay on. I didn't think to hammer them on because I didn't want to crack the plastic wheels but maybe that will work. It is the perfect size for a child who is 18months or older but if you want a toy that will have a little more longevity keep shopping.
2,Broke within 2 months,I would have to agree with the previous reviewer that said the stroller is not very sturdy. The same thing happened to my 2 year olds stroller. Within 2 months the back had broken out and it is stuck in the fully reclined position. It is very frustrating to my daughter who rarely plays with it now because the dolls keep falling out. Otherwise it was a great toy.
2,doll carraige,This carraige is cheap junk. I was noot happy with it. It came too late for me to go out and get another gift. Was embaressed to give
4,Nice stroller for a 2 yr old,"My Mother in law purchased this stroller for my daughter for Christmas, she loves it! The only problem as others have stated, it is small, fine for her, but, the one wheel was broken, thank goodness my husband is handy, he had to figure something out to keep it on, it kept falling off and my daughter got frustrated.I might mention that I purchased one of these back in 2002for my niece and it was made much larger than my daughters was, my niece still plays with hers, but, her's looks sturdier and larger, more than one doll can fit in it. I was a little dissapointed when I saw my daughters that it was so much smaller, but, for a younger child, it is fine, she is only 18 months old and just adores it. I imagine I will have to look for a larger, sturdier one when she gets older.Overall for a child of her age, I am happy with it, they just have to work out the flaws with the wheels."
4,Good information on nutrition,I've really enjoyed the nutrition information in this book. My only regret is that I purchased a used copy that is 13 years old. The newer edition has some new chapters that has upgraded information.
5,Funny and entertaining,"This is a short video, which lasts about 30 minutes as it looks into the lives of Ace of Base members even before they became #1 in the USA. They struggle a bit with the language, but seem like the happiest 4 people around, just learning the truths about the success, fame, etc. Nice insight on the band and making of thier first, and so far most successful album, ""The Sign."" The video also features few videos off of the album, including the videos never released in the USA. A definite must-have, especially since it's so cheep."
5,the best,i like this vidio much.it talks about thier lives and i like it because all the song on the sign cd are sung by linn(malin) my favorite member of ace of base and alot of the sogns she sing are on this vidio
3,Good for Party type Setting but quite disappointing!,"I was upset that this album was delayed about three times so I just gave up wanting it, but I bought it as a gift for a friend and played it as a DJ for their party. I previewed the album before but didn't really listen to it but it wasn't until I heard Jump Jump that I was turned off. J has a lot of talent, I don't understand why he would sample a secular artist (I won't say who) and use the beat as his own. Many people in the Gospel industry are doing this and it's sad. I was asked to stop playing the song because those that already recognized the beat were afraid others would too. It takes attention away from the purpose of the song. The content may have been good but it defeats the purpose is the delivery is lacking.All in all, It's alright, not really worth the wait, and he definitely deviated from his first album, but if he sounded the exact same, no one would like it."
2,Disappointed,"I was really anticipating the release of this CD. I keep hearing his first single on this CD played and I was like ""Well when is his CD coming out! I can't wait to get it!"" I really really loved his first CD. That CD helped me through a very hurtful and difficult situation but this one sounds too computerized and contemporary. I personally need that gospel feel with strong melodies. I like a little comtemporary sound but not too much. And his voice is so beautiful he doesn't need any sound effects or any enhancements what so ever. Hopefully the 3rd one will be better. I only like Praise on the Inside and Operator."
1,Major Disappointment,"This CD was a major disappointment. J Moss is a talented singer but this CD serves as a major example when Gospel music crosses the line of ministry and has become too worldly. First off, why is this man flaunting a gold and diamond encrusted cross on the cover like Bishop Don Juan ( a well known pimp)? What message is that sending to our children? Where is the humility?Secondly, the music is wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy too contemporary and I like contemporary gospel but this isn't gospel music in my book. This is R & B music with a few ""Jesus"" shout outs. I loved J's first CD but I don't know where are the roots of the ministry in these songs? There are a few songs on here that show the potential of what a great CD this could have been but everytime you start to ""feel"" then another hip hop song comes along and snaps you out of it.I gave my CD away to a friend and 3 days later she gave it back and now it's gathering dust."
1,Just Another R&B album in disguise...,"Beats, they're all right. Lyrical content... sounds like another r&b artist who couldn't make it in the secular world so they decided to try to become a gospel artist."
1,V2,I absolutely love JMoss but this album isn't what i'm used to hearing. Needless to say I was extremely disappointed. I will continue listening to V1.
1,Hip-hop or gospel?,"This CD is not as good as his last CD. It has a hip hop flavor and at one point I thought he was talking about cheating on his wife?! I was a bit confused and disappointed. I like ""Praise on the inside"" but other than that it was not worth my money."
2,riviera praiser,This cd has a lot of entertaining music. But it missed the spiritual ministering for me.
2,I DON'T LIKE THIS,"I do not like this cd at all. J Moss is one day going to have to face the fact that he is 40 and not 19. He has a boy group under his wings and he really should leave the HIP HOP to them. He is a real singer, and folks want to hear real music from real singers. This album is incomplete and leaves you wondering why you purchased it."
3,NOT AS GOOD AS LAST ALBUM!!,"Seriously...what grown man uses the word ""giddy"" to talk about Praise & Worship? I really wasn't feeling this album. A couple tracks make it onto my iPod, but it didn't meet my expectation at all. I think the best tracks were ""Let's Go To Florida"" and ""Everybody Ain't Got A Word."" It's worth a listen though, I'm not sorry I bought it, but I wouldn't recommend it!"
5,Some of the the best fusion ever played,"Some of the best, most intelligent, acute, funny, interesting, groovin', catching fusion ever played. The opening track is a 7 minutes tune that is a fist in the face to those who believe fusion is music for elevators or caos stuff without any substance. This is spectacular electric funky jazz that can make a dead dance! Spectacular solos all around from every cat in the band. Incredible time from all the musicians. Interaction is really good. They seem a kind of Weather Report meets Hendrix, meets Trane kind of band. This release should show a badge on the cover: ""Extreme material inside: handle with care"". You'll never look at fusion music the same way."
2,Not happy,"We purchased this for our 12 year old son for Christmas and the minute we tried to show him how to use it, the ""low battery"" indicator came on and within seconds it turned off, so we can't even say whether it actually works or not, but I sure hope that the odd sized batteries needed to run it are easy to find, otherwise this was a terrible waste of money. =/"
1,"boring, forgettable, and terrible!","the reviews really had me going, but it's just a good marketing campaign, if you ask me.I had totally forgotten I got this cd, because I got RID of it just as immediately. It wasn't even worth the effort for me to resell it, I just handed it over to a coworker in case they might like it.I know I know, I'm not really saying anything constructive, but shoot, it's not memorable enough.FLUFF!"
5,Offenbach Overtures/Wiener Symphoniker . Bruno Weil,"Excellent music, excellently performed. Amazon service in order was everything it should be. I'm very pleased."
5,This is a great raincoat!,"My husband ordered this jacket as a raincoat and he loves it. It's warm, even without the removable fleece insert. The removable insert is actually cute enough to wear on its own. The hood is detachable, and the jacket looks good with or without it. It's a perfect San Francisco casual winter coat. (it makes me want one for myself!)"
5,As Warm as it gets!,I ought this jacket 2 years ago Christmas and it still looks like new! I am warmer in this than any Jacket I have ever owned. Love it!!
4,Derrty #1,"Good sharp looking shoe... mine arrived a little scuffed and dusty, but nothing a little elbow grease couldn't fix."
5,Excellent CD,"Although we had heard some of the cuts from this CD, we were surprised at how consistantly good the entire CD turned out to be! This is definitely one of those CDs you leave in your car player all the time. We especially enjoyed listening to ""No News"" over and over!"
1,Review of Giasone (Cavalli),"Cavalli is a great early opera ccmposer. You would not know this from this production. It is terrible: one of the very worst I have seen. It is filled with sillyness. In the beginning Jason arises from his bed naked. He is wearing a flesh-colored pouch over his genitals. The only reaction is to laugh out loud. Why not white linen drawers? Or naked, which nobody would mind today. Somebody explain the rest of the set to me. Then explain the weird costumes. Despite my love of Cavalli, I simply discarded this."
5,My dogs LOVE these treats!,"I used to get a single 16 oz. of these,until I noticed the 3 pack.It worked out to be only 12.$ per pound...such a deal!And the quality of the chicken jerky? It's amazing! The rawhide skewer is covered with very thick chicken jerky.My dogs know if I leave the house that they usually will get one of these treats to occupy them for at least 30 minutes....I am beginning to think they WANT me to leave in order to get these treats!"
2,Made in china,"Don''t buy it. My dog loves the treat. HOWEVER, after I found out it was made in china, I decide to throw away the remaining portion. I don't want to take any chances. I see that someone left a review saying their dog got sick after eating the treat. Luckily my dog is doing fine still. But I won't buy this again."
1,Don't WASTE YOUR MONEY.,"I would advise to anyone considering this magazine to save your money. For the price you would be better off purchasing a couple of books or exploring some of the great fiber art blogs on the Internet. The cover art looks so enticing and beautiful. Once you open it up, though, it is one advertisement after another. What FEW projects that are featured are mediocre and uninspiring. I feel I wasted my money and recommend you not do the same."
5,Quilting Arts Magazine,"A very innovative and forward looking magazine. The articles are thorough, informative and stretch the creative juices of it readers. There are clear instructions for many different types of creative quilting. I would recommend this publication for the more adventurous and creative fiber arts quilter. I have never been dissapointed in a single issue."
1,Get with it Amazon.,"The photo and description do not match for this item. The photo is for the line that is now retired and unavailable. The description (Jane Lunger sculptures) refers to a newer release that is totally different from the picture. Also, Breyer collectors don't want to just GUESS which model they are going to get. Many of us only collect particular molds and or colors. Give us some choice--every other Breyer dealer out there realizes this and sells them separately while allowing choice of which model will be received."
1,Marketplace Purchase NOT as Advertised,"I purchased what's advertised here as a set from one of the listed Amazon Marketplace sellers, RGSGLASSARTANDBREYERS. They sent only one horse, chosen by them at random...not the 12 of 24 described above. As such, the ""low"" cost plus shipping was NOT discounted: it was in fact more than 200% what I'd pay locally."
1,"It Doesn't Work, Period.","Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2005 for Mac simply doesn't work. It stopped working a mere few months after its initial release when Apple's QuickTime stopped supporting a feature/function used by the game. Aspyr knows about this problem. Their tech support team even knows about the problem. You would imagine Aspyr would issue a recall, refunds, or least a statement to the public. Unfortunately, they continue to sell this game everywhere Mac games are available. People, like me, have purchased this game and still have not experienced any gameplay. Class action lawsuit, anyone?Let me repeat: this game will NOT work on any Mac. Do not buy it. This product should not be listed on Amazon."
2,Not Happy With Tiger Woods 2005,"I don't understand why they felt a need to customize the golfer, right down to the size of the golfer's nostrils! It seems like an awful waste of programming and unnecessary use of the computer's resources. Why not improve the graphics which were better in TW 2003? Tiger Woods 2003 is a much better game and more realistic. TW 2003 application was 4.1 MB's and 2005 is 7.8 MB's. Who cares about the size of a golfer's head, ears, eyes, nose, mouth, etc.? The graphics in TW 2003 were much better than TW 2005!"
2,Not as expected...,"I'm a hardcore Braxton fan, but found this box set to be one of my least favorite Braxton records. The guitarist can play really fast, but that's all he does...there's no musicality in it. The rhythm section is good at interacting with each other, but Braxton is at such a higher level than them, that the only reason you should buy this box set is to hear Braxton play. I'm not saying that the rest of the players are ""bad""...they're just not up to Braxton's level, and can't make any interesting contributions to the music."
4,Remind me of cliff notes,Just great to have as a refresher or over view to the subject matter. It's on the shelf next to my reference books.
4,"Entertaining for casual readers, not for academic use","This is probably one of the best Dummies books I have seen. It takes subject matter that can be very boring at times and makes it very approachable for the average person.It has very little depth and is a sampler of mythology. The author does instruct about the various periods and provides enough of the more popular fables, tales, and such.The author did a great job of including Native American and other folklore which most people have never read.It is a very entertaining read and it is not too clever for its own good.I bought this for my daughter, since mythology has all but disappeared as part of high school cirriculum. And I did buy it for myself as well.This is not a study guide, as other reviewers have noted, and it is not the authors intention.."
3,"Well, it is for Dummies","Mythology for Dummies is an OK book if you are looking for a very general, very readable introduction to mythology. The author actually spends quite a bit of time on Greek mythology, and by extension, Roman mythology. But he punts on Judeao-Christian mythology, mentioning only that God created man twice in Genesis and mentioning Noah. I am certain that he did not want to tork off Christians, and was trying to stick to either dead religions or those that most Americans (the target audience) would not have contact with. He also completely ignored Islam. He spent so much time on the Greeks and Romans, moreover, that he gave only cursory sketches of the religions of Asia and worse coverage of the religions of the American Natives (which admittedly could take multiple volumes to provide the proper justice).Buy it used, or rent from the library before you commit. If it fits your bill, then go for it, but don't make the mistake of thinking it is comprehensive."
1,You get what you pay for,"This nasty little machine has an on/off switch that easily switches to on if you knock it lightly with a plate and has a carafe that might has well be placed on a sheet of ice from the perspective of stability. Braun Aromaster is highly rated by Consumer Reports and is generally a good product, but the deign on this thing just doesn't cut it. The carafe shattered into a million pieces this a.m. after owning it for one week. The replacement carafe cost $4.00 more than I paid for the coffeemaker."
4,Good design at a risonable price,The Italian price of the same item is much higher than the one I have found at your Amazon shop.
2,SAD!,"Not even Marcello, not even Virna, could keep this abortive attempt afloat. That says plenty about what happens when cheap foreign tastes and formulae are imported into Italy."
4,Casanove 70,"This movie I seen it in English, it is very funny. I wish amazon.com could make it available in English if they wanted to. More people would enjoy it better and I would buy it again in English.Thank you for giving me a chance to sound off."
1,Unacceptable,I would like to review the contents of this movie if only I had been able to view it. The DVD would not play in 2 DVD players and 1 blu-ray player.
5,Excellent Recording,"My only complaint is that some of the arias are a little too slow; otherwise, it is perfect!"
2,Beware,Beware of using this valve if you are using a backup pump such as a WatchDog battery backup pump. I have 8 feet of vertical head pressure so I use a 3/4 hp pump. The valve on the backup line breaks down from the back pressure of the main 3/4hp pump. The 3/4 hp pump literally pushed the flap valve backwards in the valve. This is the third valve that has failed. I am looking for a more industrial check valve that can handle the 3/4hp pump pressure.
2,Indian Designs,"I purchased this book because I wanted a source of authentic Indian designs I could use for gourd pyrography, some of which I hope to sell. The book only contains 48 designs, one per page. For my purposes, that many are not a lot to choose from. After reading this statement in the preface, ""...intended for personal enjoyment,---and not for commercial purposes."" I'm not sure I could sell any gourds with these designs without violating the copyright."
5,WONDERFUL FOR ART EDUCATORS,"Very simple and clear black and white drawings of Native American designs (animals). Each design has the tribe's name below it, a brief description and some have interesting information about the significance of that particular animal. I have used this book over and over again with my art students aged 5 - 12 and the artwork produced was exceptional. They are all animal motifs and an art educator could easily use it for a project about fantasy animals."
5,Indian Designs Review,"Great book for using different Native American Indian designs. A little large, but they are nice detail."
4,Why is this Book Impossible to Find?,"I had imagined that every working adult would like a copy of this book. I've so-far owned two copies, both of which were lent out and never returned. I imagine that somebody out there (well, two actually) must have liked it as much as I do and I'm not mad at them, as the third time I went for a copy I found the book on tape, read by the author.I realise that it is now hard to find with no new printing in sight, but if you ever do spot a copy somewhere, you need it. If you went to university and ended up flipping burgers, buy it. If you've ever found yourself in a strange place after having lied your way into employment and about to do something you're having second thoughts about, buy it. If you're just entering the work force for the first or sixty fourth time, buy it!"
3,Blown Sideways Through Life: A Hilarious Tour de Resume,Great Read! Wow what a crazy list of jobs! Claudia sounds like a fun girl to know and work with. Read this book!
4,wish i could have seen the show,"I was looking for one-person shows and couldn't find any on video, so I got a couple books- this being one of them.It was everything a one-woman show should be- funny entertaining, and a great ""takeaway"" at the end.I felt like she learned something form the journey and has finally found herself, and doesn't need to go looking for job #67 (or whatever number she was up to when she wrote this book). I loved hearing about the inner workings of so many jobs, many of which I never even knew existed (like receptionist at a brothel, proofreader of boring financial press releases).She was funny, sincere, sympathetic, and entertaining. I enjoyed it so much I immediately gave it away to someone I knew who said she hadn't been able to find a copy of it anywhere.I missed the opportunity to see this when she was performing it as a one-woman show. I bet it was great."
2,Not gritty enough,"I must say, I was quite disappointed with this book. While the David Eckstein heart was in full force, the level of grit was somewhat lacking. I also could have used a bit more hustle. Also, I'm not so sure why there were so many references to Holiday Inn.Remember at the end of How the Grinch Stole Christmas, the Grinch's heart grew and grew? It's because he was thinking of how David Eckstein makes centerfielders slip on wet grass. That's one thing I learned in this book."
5,Excellent Inspirational Book for Everyone!,I just finished reading this book and I would recommend it for kids and adults of all ages. It tells the inspirational story of David Eckstein and his family growing up from a first-person point of view. He is definitely coming from a Christian perspective in this book too. ENJOY!
1,this is not a case- deceptive advertising - wont give me a refund,"[...] remember this name and don't buy anything from them. I bought this item, the add says clearly ""aluminum case for 13 inch mac"". Its just a handle! A tiny little handle with two tiny screws that your supposed to trust to keep 1300.00 dollar laptop from crashing into the concrete. i asked for a refund they sent me a short impersonal form letter stating that i had waited too long and they would give no refund. So if they wont make good at least I might stop somone else from trusting them like i did and save their money."
1,Misleading Title Discription,"I purchased this as a Christmas present for son, when it arrived it was not what I expected. The description cearly states the words Carrying Case, Aluminum Body with handle...""Case-Mate Handle It - 13"" Mac Book Laptop Carrying Case, Aluminum Body with Handle, Black (67494)"".THis is not a 'case' at all it is just a handle. Needless to say, I will be returning it. The Company that shipped it is a very good company and always ships on time I will continue to use them."
3,"Nice Booster, especially for the price!","I like this seat, but more importantly- my 4 year old son likes it. In fact, he loves it! He can easily pull the cup tray out, lift up arm rests, and turn on the light. The only thing I would change is the size of the head bumpers, as they are a bit too small. When my son falls asleep, he tilts right past them and hangs his head in an uncomfortable fashion. Otherwise, this has been a fantastic booster seat and we'd recommend it to others. We bought another booster (the Combi Kobuk) a few years ago and this Evenflo is comparable, though $30 less expensive."
5,Comfortable for a 4 year old,"My four year old loves his new car seat with the cup holders and tray he can store things in. His head flops about a bit if he falls asleep in it, but he can sometimes wedge it against the angled head supports. I was surprised by the lack of LATCH but I guess that's how the booster seats work. He can even unbuckle it himself. To buckle it in though you have to lean across the seat which isn't always easy for pregnant wife."
2,Misleading Shipping Cost Disappointing Performance,"Amazon will show this as ""Eligible for Free Shipping"", but when you buy this item, it does not automatically give you free shipping at checkout. My fault for assuming that Amazon was above such trickery. You have to complete an offer first. Why would I end up paying more thru Amazon than at my Walmart 1 mile away? Very misleading.I was also disappointed that this Booster seat does not have any sort of Latch system; my grandchild would tip sideways on every turn when placed in the center (""safest"") seat. I will try to transplant the Latch system from his old seat to make this work. The headrest is also set very far forward; while it looks uncomfortable, my grandson said it was OK, so we continue to use it."
4,Great except no EPS foam,I was really excited to find the Big Kid DLX Booster seat at a retail store. It was just what I was looking for except I did not like the leopard print pattern. I went online and ordered the Hawkeye pattern not realizing it does not have the EPS foam. I was very disappointed with that but decided to keep it. My twins love the lights so they can draw when it is dark.
5,"Durable, easy to clean, and CUP HOLDERS!",My son loves putting his drink in the cup holders. The seat is very easy to clean and has held up to the test of toddlers and time. Highly recommended.
5,love it,We got this for our granddaughter to use when she is staying with us. We already had one for our older granddaugter and she loves it.
4,Big Kid DLX Booster seat,This is an excellant booster for toddlers 40lbs.+ It's easy to install and use and is easy for kids to get into themselves. The height adjustment is a nice additional feature. I recommend it!
4,Booster Seat,So far so good. My daughter finds it very comfortable for long drives and loves the retractable cup holders. We don't use the lights; batteries weren't included and we haven't installed them.
4,Nice Carseat!,"I looked at several carseats before deciding on this one. My son will be 8 years old in February but is pretty small for his age and will still need to be in a seat for a couple years I think. The only problem I've had is that it did not fit in my car very well ('08 Chevy Malibu.) It seems as time has passed, it has settled in and is going to work but at first I was very hesitant. The pattern of the seat is very nice (matches my car interior) and my son loves the lights on the side for when we're driving at night and he wants to look at something. I do not think he's fallen asleep in it yet so I honestly cannot rate how the head reast portion of it works. Overall, this seems to be a very good carseat and I would recommend it!"
5,Best of all voltage testors,"I have had this type of voltage testor for years, always with satisfactory results. After losing it I ordered another and it was sent and packaged in an excellent way."
3,Wrong tool?,"This cleaver seems to be made well but doesn't have the heft for the job I bought it to do, cut open heavy squash such as butternut and spaghetti. I used it to separate chicken parts and it worked well. Maybe a cleaver is the wrong tool for the job I purchased this item for."
3,About as good a book available on 2 valvers,"This is the best book you can get on the subject of 2 valve Ducatis, which include the Monsters and Supersports. It includes a great history of Ducati, as owned by the Italian government, Cagiva, and a Texas corporate group. Great technical information, a couple of fair diagrams and drawings, but lots of pictures. I dont know if it warrants the hefty price, but a good read nonetheless."
5,Cute and worth the price.,"These come individually wrapped because they are meant for gashapon vending machings (the $1 Japanese style egg machines). There for the price is good because to get a complete set in person it would cost at least $8 and no telling if you'd get each one the first try. Still, while many of them are doubles in different color combinations they make great gifts for friends. Since they match they could be used for ""BFF"" type matching cell phone straps. Another way of looking at is that you can color coordinate with outfits or moods. Recommended!"
2,They left out the yellow one,I love hello kitty...lol Cell Phone charms are kinda out of style but I had to have these lol. I kinda didnt care for the fact they left out the yellow one and gave me an extra of the one in the blue box. BUT as long as got the Purple and red one lol Thats all tht matters..kinda lol
2,not as expected,"This order only includes one folder, but it says ""25 per box"" and no where does it indicate this is for a single folder. The price would be reasonable for one, however with the shipping it is quite expensive."
1,Not in any way gourmet or worth the price,"The chocolates were melting when they arrived, but that was the least of the problems. There was nothing gourmet about the small box of chocolates we received. I'd suggest finding a better chocolate of the month club because there must be reasonable alternatives."
5,To drop a dime,"An excellent real life story about the New Jersey mob,in the seventies. The real Sopranos!"
2,unreal,"how anyone can read such a book filled with gore and violence is beyond me. i am the child of one of the men mentioned killed in this book, and do not find it flattering or appealing the incident was wrote about at all. it is like airing dirty laundry to the entire world and broadcasting for millions of people the personal and private lives of those mentioned in here. it is a story filled with some facts, some are unknown to be reality. and as it is filled with truths, how anyone can seem to misinterpret fiction over the pains of the lives of others who were left behind in this mess, is completely beyond my comprehension"
2,displeased,"I FOUND THE BOOK TO BE TOTALLY OFFENSIVE IN NATURE AND CONTENT AND DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW ANYONE COULD FIND THE MATERIAL TO BE SO SUITABLE TO READ. I AM THE CHILD OF ONE OF THE MEN MENTIONED KILLED IN THIS BOOK AND FIND THE WHOLE THING TO BE INAPPROPRIATE THAT ""FAMILY"" BUSINESS WAS BROADCAST TO MILLIONS OF READERS WHO APPROVE OF THIS TYPE OF BEHAVIOR"
4,Clean Park Mat,"We purchased the clean park mat primarily to keep snow melt from our car from running all over the garage floor, and it does an excellent job. Due to the wrinkles left from packing the mat folded rather than rolled, it is a little difficult to clean off, but a soft floor squeegee works satisfactorily. This is the second mat we have purchased. The first mat provided satisfactory service for about seven years of daily traffic before having to be replaced."
4,"""The Escher Twist"" Winds Around an Artful Plot","It doesn't take long to figure out that Jane Langton's use of Escher prints provides creative foreshadowing in ""The Escher Twist."" Just like the Escher prints used throughout the book, you're not sure if you are seeing what you think you are seeing. The characters in this delightful story ramble through the plot at a relaxed, though never dull, pace. The main characters' child-like views of the world are just innocent enough to be charming without drifting over the ""Dumb and Dumber"" fault line. ""The Escher Twist"" winds down to a tidy and satisfying conclusion."
3,Clunky,"I have liked some Jane Langton Boston-area mysteries in the past, in part because of their lovely line drawing illustrations and the undeniable pleasure of plots playing out in familiar places. I had not picked one up for a long time when I read this, which I found clunkily written and with plot devices telegraphed a leafy Cambridge mile away. I found the writing pedestrian, despite the use of MC Escher prints, quotes, and concepts. Homer and Mary Kelly are an engaging couple, but in this book their conversations felt stilted.Please note also that the Kindle edition of this must have been created via some kind on unedited scan - lots of distracting typos that were about what you'd get if you scanned something but didn't check it."
4,Fun costume - but be aware of the fabric,"This is a fun costume, and my 4 yr old son loved it so much that he wore it for 2 days. But his skin is sensitive, and after the 2 days his eczema flaired up terribly. Now he can only wear the costume for a short amount of time before his skin becomes itchy again. So, just be aware that the fabric is 100% polyester. Also, the cheap, plastic belt buckle broke within a couple of days, but my son was okay with that. The costume itself is very cute."
2,Not so much,"So we received this in the mail yesterday and put my 3 year old in it tonight. He loves it, but I can say it is not really worth the price. The hat already split tonight, the buckle does NOT stay on the belt and constantly pops off! It is cute and like I said he likes it, but so not worth the money!"
1,Call Dr. Kevorkian,"With all respect Mr. Siff, his alter-ego Vera needs to be put to eternal rest. This DVD is for hard core fans only of this shtick."
4,"Highly professional, but lacking in passion","The presence of a Russian virtuoso like Yefim Bronfman should have guaranteed genuine Slavic passion in the great Tchaikovsky Piano Trio, but Bronfman has increasingly been playing it safe. What is this tendency for star musicians in this country like Perlman, Ax, Midori, and now Bronfman to rest on their laurels? Comparison to the impassioned live performance from Argerich-Kremer-Maisky on DG makes this version of the Tchaikovsky sound half asleep.Naturally the playing is altogether professional, and Sony has provided adequate sonics (though not a patch on the riveting DG sound). However, without total commitment on everyone's part, the Tchaikovsky Trio suffers from sprawl and waywardness, as it does here form time to time. In all, a good performance that misses the mrk for being something really special."
2,Not my cup of tea.,"This music, which I'm sure will appeal to some, left me disappointed. I can only speak for myself, but this collection strikes me as dissonant and disjointed. I love movie scores which generally serve to inspire and/or promote emotion. But, if that's what you are looking for, I do not believe you will find those qualities in this CD. I'm sure Mr. Zorn is a gifted composer...but his work is not a style which I would embrace."
1,Historical?,"This book tries to give a historical background to Christian ethics. In this, it fails miserably.It is full of the same Protestant-slanted misinterpretations on early Church fathers. It also has a distinctive anti-monastic leaning."
3,"smooth, funky, original","Fresh change from the ordinary urban-category fare. However, the New-Jack residue is heavy and recognizable, so it's a little dated. That's not always bad, as it made me reminisce on the early 90s, but others may find it played-out. If you're just trying 2 get any Jazzhole album, though, try ...and the feeling goes round or Blackburst first."
3,Too R&B for me,"This album is way too R&B. Check out their second album, ""...and the feeling goes round,"" which is thirty times more jazzy."
2,Received in fair condition.,"Book was used so the highlighting by former user was somewhat expected.Book in fair condition.Useful.Thank,CW"
3,Television and Radio Announcing,The book was in great condition but I was not please with how long it took to ship especially since I paid for 2 day shipping. I emailed the seller but it didn't seem like they cared about my concerns over the book not shipping in 2 days.
2,Speed is slow for this device,"Somehow this sony memory stick is awfully slower than the SanDIsk one i got before, It takes 6-7 minuts to copy 500M to my computer.Plus this price is more expensive... There is another 512Model havea faster transfer speed, might worthy more bucks to try"
5,Excellent customer service!,"I ordered this item for my camera which is about 15 years old.The memory size was too big and so I had to return it to the seller. Absolutley no trouble with the return. I am grateful for the ""no hassle"" return of the item. Seller is awesome!!"
2,Lost my pictures,Did not work well with my card reader. Lost most of the pictures I took with it. My card reader worked with the other cards that I bought.
5,Sea Nasties,"This is a wonderful movie. It combines the hilarity of Leslie Neilson with education in an attempt to dispell the myths of the dangers of the ocean. It talkes about many of the oceans dangerous creatures from jellyfish to conesnails. It tells very factually about the creatures, how dangerous they are, and how you can avoid the danger. Neilson keeps the movie light while providing information on the dangers in the sea and just how mythical they are. I am a marine biologist and I found the movie to be very accurate though it was a bit dramatic."
5,SECRETS and THE RESTAURANT,"I watched both of these shorts and they are both GREAT! The Restaurant is an emotional love story, but I don't want to say much and give it away. I just wish it was longer. The best one is Secrets, and it is an emotional roller coaster ride. There are adult situations so you want to be careful about the kids seeing it. It really gets into the head of a rapist in a way I have never seen before. I give two thumbs up to both of these shorts! They are both on one dvd, so be careful about the kids seeing Secrets, but The Restaurant is okay for the whole family."
1,"Slow....poor acting,",The stories were poorly constucted. They used two different people to portray the same person. Not worth the time. skipped through most of it to the end.
2,Secrets and the restaurant,Secrets and the restaurant is ok for the first few minutes then starts downward to something else. Hard to follow and not like other movies. It is not like other movies this one has no plot or movement. Energy and flow is somehwere else.
5,great!,great movies!! i was weary about them at first but am so glad i took a chance and got this!!! and i agree- The Restaurant is a family film. Secrets-adults only. great actors and the writing/directing/producing/music/etc...-PHENOMENAL! FIVE STARS!
4,Its a good movie,"Very good movie. The resteraunt, is great acting and secrets is touches the very thought of a rapist and a rape victim"
4,Pretty but....,It's a cute watch but it fits sort of weird. The straps look really flexible they are hard and the watch part is really thick.
1,BEWARE: YOU CANNOT RETURN THIS ITEM! CAVEAT!,"I have antoher one of these i purchased locally and it works great. The problem is that the one I received from AMAZON had been traumatized in shipping and had some dents. It was clearly a returnable item, but when I went to return it the Amazon site said something like...""cannot return items with toxic liquids, contact manufacturer for returns""...I contacted Hair and they NEVER RESPONDED. I WOULD NOT BUY THIS FROM AMAZON IF I WERE YOU, CAUSE YOU ARE STUCK WITH WHATEVER ARRIVES IN THE BOX."
1,Too loud!,This fridge is way too loud to make up for price and stylishness. I could hear it from a floor below mine. Do not purchase.
3,It does the basics,"This Haier model is the super-economy solution for people who want to keep 40 bottles of wine at a constant temperature. Positve features: inexpensive, relatively light to move, quiet operations, attractive exterior. Negative features: does not hold 46 bottles as advertised, no temperature gauge, inexpensive parts."
1,USED ITEM - DO NOT PURCHASE,"I do not usually do this, but I thought I'd take some time out to warn all of you out there. DO NOT purchase this item through Amazon.com. They sent me a USED item that looked like it had been opened and tampered with before. There were screws falling off inside the refrigerator that didn't look like they were supposed to be falling off. The door hinge was bent up. The bottom was glued up like it had been repaired before. The outside had scuff marks all over it like it had been tossed around.I was expecting to pay for a NEW item and got someone elses USED old Refrigerator! I did not expect this buying from Amazon.com!"
3,Not great for wine,"The beverage center is just that...a refrigerator that holds bottles and cans. Unfortunately, even at the lowest settings...the temp is still WAY too low for fine wines...I'm guessing it's around 42-45 degrees. It also vibrates like a refrigerator...not the best environment for wine. I'll probably use it for my whites and keep my finer reds elsewhere."
1,WaitingI,"I still have not received the product. I see it is now supplied by another vendor. I have sent an email to WholeSalesMall, stating I still have not received the item. They have told me that it was shipped twice the second time with delivery confirmation. Still no product has reached my mailbox."
5,Philip Gayle is a genious,"First of all: this album isn't easy. But yes, it IS music. And the music is very rewarding if you are willing to do away with some preset ideas on how music should be.Gayle isn't making music in the traditional sense of the word. There are no refrines, there do not even seem to be tones or melodies, or plain rhythms. What you get is at first sight a cacophony of sounds while Gayle is hammering and scratching his instruments. The idea is more something of sounds and noises which in some way fit together, rather than a bunch of notes forming a melody.But the brilliant thing is: yes, there are melodies, though not directly at the surface. The brilliant thing is that Gayle brings all the contradictions together: the music seems chaotic but yet is highly organized and structure; it is improvised and yet overdubbed. It is a cacophony of sounds and yet very melodic.But you have to let that happen; if you close your mind for it immediately it can never grab you."
1,very disappointed,"I totally have to agree with Jeannie. I was really excited when I bought this toy for my son, but was extremely disappointed to see it was plastic with stickers, and the string was only 6 inches long. It didn't bounce and the antennae do not move. Nothing like the old wood toy I remember from my childhood. Spend your money on a real wood toy not this cheap imitation."
5,beddable,"sexy little book, modern romantic-provocative poems. no boring academic high falutin pieces. i keep it by the bed for seduction purposes! my wife loves it!"
5,"Talented, gifted, writer","Great CD, I've heard alot about Brian and when I do I like to get the artist first work to see what motivates them. Certainly He is going to be one of the greats if he keeps his head connected to the Vision. I've heard other cuts/disks of his ... Will get more of his work."
1,Tired Tripe,"Like the HBO Show: Real Time with Bill Maher; this book too often cuts to the cheap joke. Maher, always a mediocre stand-up, can't resist an easy joke where a top comic would aim higher. Bill sets the bar comfortably low: keep the yucks coming, kiss the celebrity bum, but don't break a sweat or Heaven Forbid come up with something original."
4,Politically Hillarious,"Bill Maher in this book always has something funny to say every other line. This book is very interesting, funny, and must of all true... Well at least most of the time. I think its safe to say that Bill Maher is a total liberalist. But one thing is true, the stupidest mornon in the world can be a extreme liberal. It takes no brains to be pro choice on everything. Although i agree with most of Bill Mahers rantings, i do believe that some times he says things even he is not sure about just to keep his extreme liberalist agenda. If you enjoy political sitire this book is your bible."
1,yawn,"While you are all busy spitting at one another, Bill Maher is probably off cavorting with Hugh Hefner and his little bunnies. Maher's association with Hefner is telling on many levels. Among them are: his affinity for the 'cool' and dedication to the depthless; his lack of meaningful personal relationships, the seed from which sprouts his warped view of society; and the maniacal influence that seems to pervade so many of his thoughts. All of that said I think that people should view Maher(and read him so that his comments can be considered naked, without the veil of cuteness). He is an example to behold. Of what? That is for you to decide."
3,"By ""Ride Alone"" instead!!!","I found myself at an event in November 2002 where Bill was pushing his ""When you Ride Alone, you Ride with Bin Laden"" book. I was so fascinated with how good it was, and how creative it is, that I kind of went on a Bill Maher kick. I bought this book afterward.Being an incredibly SLOW reader, I was still halfway though this little paperback in under an hour. It's mostly questions that were asked at a show, the occasional comment by Bill, and very rarely sprinkled with guests' answers. There are a few gems in it, but overall, your money is much better spent on ""When you Ride Alone you ride with Bin Laden."""
3,Disappointing!,"Maher is great but this book isn't. Bill often has profound viewpoints that I agree with. In this book, however, Maher too often placed a higher priority on being funny than making intelligent remarks. Also, although the cover says ""The Best of POLITICALLY INCORRECT,"" the book is not really related to the show. I expected intelligent comments by both Maher and a wide variety of guests. Instead, nearly all of the book consists of statements made by Maher (not on his show) and not by his guests. This book is not worth reading although Maher's show is worth watching.Lee J. Markowitz, Ph.D. Student"
2,"Good guy, So, so book.","I found this book to be nothing more than an instant replay of Maher's television shows. But then that's exactly what it's advertised to be. We should give thanks when we end up with something that's as advertised. It's just that after six years of Bush and Cheney, the truth is boring.True, this is more of a soapbox than a review, but that's okay since I'm a registered Republican. George W. Bush has decreed that we're not governed by the same rules and laws as everyone else. It wasn't that long ago that Bush bashing was one of the loneliest jobs in the world. Now, if you're not careful, you'll get trampled under by the androids and politicians who are trying to distance themselves from Bush, Cheney and America's Dachau--Abu Ghraib and the Iraqi holocaust."
3,Lets go biking,I got this to go bike riding and it fit good comes with the straps and extra padding for different size heads hahahaha.but the color is darker then the picture.
5,Giro Flak Helmet,"This helmet arrived today in adequate packaging. Upon opening, I noticed extra pads for fitment adjustment. The chin strap was strong and easy to adjust. The helmet has a small splash of graphics across the back, that really makes it stand out a bit. One of the only complaints I have, is that the Color I chose was so dark that it looks black next to green objects. This is not a big deal, but I bought the helmet also because the color name was the same as a bike I ordered, Matte Olive. My bike is actually traditional Matte Olive in color, but this helmet is very dark. For the money, it's a fully functional helmet that fits great, highly adjustable, and lets your head breath more than most helmets in this price bracket. Happy Buyer!"
4,Sizing,"Here's the size chart from Giro's site:S: 21""-21.75"" / 51-55 CMM: 21.75""-23.25"" / 55-59 CML: 23.25""-24.25"" / 59-63 CM"
3,"Sturdy all purpose helmet, picture is a major false advertisement though","I was looking for a bike helmet that was better made and differently styled than the standard bike helmets out there. This is a nice, multi-sport helmet that is heavier than a standard bike helmet so not the helmet to buy if weight is an issue. It's also a little hotter inside this helmet than a standard bike helmet but that is to be expected from this type of helmet. Appears to be made from higher quality materials as well. I agree with the one negative review, huge disappointment in the color. I couldn't see most of the reviews very well since I ordered this on my mobile. I bought the Matte Olive and the color is definitely more of a charcoal color and you might see the faint iridescent green in bright light and you strain to see it. Nothing at all close to the photo. Also, no size chart? I have 21"" head circumference and bought the medium which gives a comfortable, not-too-snug fit."
1,This thing is HUUUUUUGE,"I can't believe all the good reviews on this helmet. Yes, it looks decent, but the thing is HUGE. I tried it on for the first time and looked hilarious. I decided to give it to my (less... fashionably conscious) dad, and even he laughed when he saw it. Check out Burn helmets for some super cool if slightly more expensive helmets. I bought a Burn and it looks badass."
5,Distinct sound and ability has Jason's Ensemble,You have to understand that this music is delightful in every sense of the word. The interaction between the musicians is of the highest. Jason has a bright future in the continuation of the art of Hard Bop. My entire family looks forward to hearing what Mr. Robinson and company can come up with next.
3,Modern West Coast Hardbop.,"Although Robinson's sound may be a bit tedious at times, the emotion is evident. The members of the ensemble play well together and their sound is distinct."
3,I wish I could say I liked this more.....,"I wish I could say I liked this more but it was a disappointment. I knew Toots' music through his ""Pressure Drop"" greatest hits anthology and was looking for the magic I found there in a live recording. While the live CD is a documentary of what sounds like a memorable musical event, I guess you had to be there to really get into the music. The songs are a bit rambling and there is too much American soul-funk influence. While the female backing vocalists are great, I miss the wonderful male harmonies of the Maytals. Also, the ""Band Steps Forward"" piece goes on way too long as Toots introduces his backing musicians with the standard ""On guitar, from such and such a place, Mr. such and suh"" following by you've-heard-it-all-before solo. Like I said, this is a great documentary but the music is far from compelling. Oh well....."
2,casinos coast to coast,The title of this book and the cover is very misleading. The book gives alot of information about casinos throughout the country but it does not go into any detail about casinos in atlantic city or las vegas. I purchased this book to find out about casinos in vegas and there wasn't any info other than names and addresses. I returned this book to amazon for a full refund. The cover should be changed.
4,"A good guide, but not as complete as advertised.","This book gives nice historical information to the various cities housing casinos, but has little data concerning food and entertainment and virtually no listings of ""comps"". The book contains reviews of hundreds of casinos around the country, but not a single review for any Nevada or New Jersey casinos, instead there is a pair of appendixes with their casino's addresses and phone numbers."
5,Awesome DVD for the collection.,Lost my single of the first one so decided to just get both of them and it's a funny movie set to add to the collection.
2,"The first is four stars, the second you should subtract five.","The first movie is funny, but putting it with one of the worst movies of the last decade. I don't think that right. I as most people get the original by itself. The second is a B rated movie with I would say F rated actors. Simply terrible. At no price would I put this in my collection."
5,Grandpa of reggae/ska,"This is the best Reggae festival, and a great performer. This cd is a must have for anyone's reggae collection."
2,Really bad!,"I bought this for about 5 bucks when he toured with Face To Face. This is not a good cd at all. There is only one good song. Anyways, His new cd ""the places you have come to fear the most"" is really good."
3,Ouch!,"The songs are good, the only 3 songs. I paid [money] for this CD. This is very pricey and it made me mad! But I really like the songs. I just wish there was more than 3. That's why I gave it 3 stars, for the price, and how many songs are on it. So find another way to get the songs, for wasting your money on 3 good songs is not worth it...."
1,lame as cambodia,at first i loved the beautiful sound of the emo gods voice pulsing like a vein thru my XhcX ears. Then i puked Amen. Brentwood lives with elvis costello in a mansion outside of Tuscany with a gaggle of untrained monks and their pet toads. Listen to 50 $
3,Only for followers of this man's music,"Chris Carraba is a good songwriter and his songs never feel half baked, but no one would buy this release unless they were a hardcore fan. I paid ten dollars for this EP and it's only 7 minutes worth of music, that's a lot for a little. I'm a fan so it's not as distressing to me, but when I think of an EP, I'm thinking of a recording between 10 and 20 minutes. ... I just wonder why he released this EP with so little material. I know that he wrote these three songs and recorded them in one night, but for the sake of the fans Chris, please include more material in the EP's from now on until the end of your career."
2,Air doesn't stay hot,"I have been using the Twinturbo 3200 everyday for 11 months. I bought it because I wanted a hair dryer that would blow very hot air. It worked great for about 9 months. After 9 months, the hot air wouldn't stay hot after 5 minutes of being on; it turns to warm air. Also, the diffuser falls off very often while the hair dryer is on. It's quite startling. My previous hair dryer was a SuperSolano that I used everyday for 6 YEARS before it failed. I do not recommend the Pibbs Twinturbo!! I am very disappointed with it."
3,Twin turbo,"Bought the tun turbo to replace my elchim blowdryer that in had for years. Purchased the twin turbo based on the reviews and that it is lighter weight then the elchim with the same power. I received my new twin turbo and I am pleased with the wright , power and Attachments I am not pleased with the fact that the of the blowdryer does not have a guard like the chi or the elchim have that protects your hair from being sucked into the motor. Ouch and it burns your hair. Basically you need to be super careful and not rush when using this dryer or your hair will be ruined."
3,Don't Try This At Home,I know a good deal about computers and Word. Yet I found this book to be very complicated almost as though it was written by programmers rather than teachers. It would make a good adjunct to classroom instruction but should not be counted upon for teaching oneself at home. Word is exasperating enough in its own right; I found this book just added to my frustrations.
5,Works in DaimlerChrysler NSG370,"TSB 21-010-04 specifies this fluid (MS-9224) for the new 6-speed manual in the Liberty and the Wrangler. In my Wrangler, it actually shifts better than the factory fill did! You'll need 1.6L to do the job."
4,Great product,smoothed out the shifts in my 92 intgera. highly recomended for that 3rd gear grind hondas are known for
1,"Very British, very peculiar, and poorly printed too.","Although this edition is specifically for the US and Canada, it could have used much more extensive editing from the original English version. ""Born gannets""? (p.10) ""Part of the hearthrug""? ""Local canine rapists""??? (p.18) The book is typeset in a small, difficult-to-read typeface, though the quality of the photography is decent. For a short book on Golden Retriever basics, Sucher is far better. Personally, I found the heavy trimming of the photographed dogs peculiar, and the common snow-white coloring alarming, but perhaps that's the state of Golden Retrievers in the UK."
3,"Worth buying for a gorgeous ninth, but as for the rest...","This is a mixed bag. Yefim Bronfman approaches the ninth with just the right amount of naivete and humility, but he does become a bit too clangorous in his versions of the second and third. I think that the extroversion of these pieces as opposed to the quietude of the 9th leads Bronfman to lose some of the nuances that he creates in the ninth. The fifth is fine, though he plays the original version (Prokofiev revised it at the end of his careeer), which is seldom played, so it caught me off guard."
5,Great gift set,I am a fan of this series so I have nothing bad to say about any of the seasons! This set is great to get someone started in a DVD collection or to give to someone who has a good sense of humor!
1,This is an Unmanaged Switch,This is NOT a smart switch. It does NOT have:Smart Web ManagementFlexible QoSConfigurable 802.1Q VlansStatic Link AggregationDo Not buy this switch.
3,Chatter Telephone,The string to pull this telephone is much too short. We had to tie another string onto it for it to be usable. Very disappointed in this as the pulling action is the most fun for little ones...
3,"Thanks for the memories, but you can't even reach the phone up to your ear!","This phone brought back childhood memories- I guess that's why I bought it. The chord on the phone is so short though that not even babies can bring the receiver up to their ears. I think that might be a reason my son doesn't play it with it very long. I know it's probably for safety reasons (?) but the pull chord is long enough to be unsafe. Not really sure what the designer was thinking on that one? Oh well, it's a good memory."
4,Fun,"This toy has been around for years. At 29 years old I remember playing with the same type. They only thing is the cord on the phone is very short. To keep the phone in place or flat and to place receiver at your ear is not possible, the cord is too short. Too bad they didnt make it retractable so it wont hang being longer but also can extend to put to your ear. Overall, always a fun toy from baby to toddler and on."
2,Not bad... but not like the old,"I bought this for my daughter remembering how much I liked the phone as a child. The plastic is very light weight which seems to cheapen the phone a bit. Also, the cord is only about a foot long so can't pull it along. I realize this must have been seen as a choking hazzard, but a shame. Still makes the same ring-ring noise and was fun to help my kids understand this is how phones used to be."
5,She Dit It Again,"This book from Amazon is so well written it keeps you on the edge of your seat; you keep going back and forth saying who did it that you get dizzy. But, then it starts to come together and you say yes they did it. And you keep wanting to say ""Look out""."
1,Harbor lite,"I agree totally with reviewer ""stiminey2"". She summed up every thought I have about the book. I was tempted to count how many times she referred to the meddling FBI agent. I haven't finished it yet but I did read the last chapter so I now how it ends, it just takes way too long to get there. So slow, never sizzled at all IMHO."
1,Didn't hold my attention.,"I gave this book 100 pages of my time - 8 full chapters. I could not get into this story, though I did try. It didn't hold my attention at all. The plot goes nowhere. I won't be finishing this one. This was my first Carla Neggers book and I'm disappointed. I have one more book of hers to try. I hope it's better than this one. If not I won't be reading any more by this author."
2,They claim this lasts 2500 hours?,"While my turtle seemed to enjoy this bulb, I have to give it a crummy review. This lamp lasts only a couple of months, while a simlar bulb that I purchased at a hardware store just kept going and going. Save your money and buy a different brand, one that last longer, or at least as long as they claim it does."
1,Long lasting? Hardly!,"I have had an adult RES for nearly a decade. Every light I've ever purchased from Zoo Med has burned out well before its stated average number of hours. I bought the Turtle Tuff light when I was unable to find my preferred brand in December of 2011 - and it burned out after six weeks! That's only 336 hours of usage, not the 2500 hours advertised. This isn't the exception, but the rule. Zoo Med lights are poorly made and I wouldn't recommend them to any herp owner. Avoid at all costs!"
4,Very good,"An outstanding book, very enjoyable. Discusses ants, wasps, bees, termites, etc. A little bit dated now, but it still has one of the best overviews of social insects and their evolution of which I am aware. It is also very readable, with numerous illustrations."
4,Good book.,"Book was bought as a gift.The receiver loved in.Personally, I felt that the book was a bit pricey, but a great academic read or even a good read for those who are into insect societies. Nevertheless, a good buy."
5,A great book for Christian singletons,"Dr. Risk's book is one of the best I have ever read. He is an intelligent and wise man who tailors his book to address single Christians as intelligent people also. He doesn't dumb down the insights he offers, and he doesn't compromise on important issues such as Christians dating non-Christians. Dr. Risk obviously put a lot of thought and prayer into this book, rather than just sharing his own experiences as a Christian singleton. This book is totally Bible-based, and the author backs up everything he says with God's word. Dating and Waiting is not a how-to-find-a-man/woman book, however. It focuses solely on building your relationship with God and trusting Him that even if you remain single forever (yikes!), God holds you in the palm of His hand. Thank you, Dr. Risk, for this wonderful book!"
1,Buyer Beware,"Word for word the 2008 edition is identical to 2007 edition. There is no new material. Practice tests are exactly the same. It is just a new cover pasted on to the 2007 book. This may be harmful to a student's test preparation because the practice tests will be easier if they did the same practice tests last year. They think they are prepared, then the actual test is much harder. This happened with my child. Does Kaplan do this with all their test books? You will want to be careful and double check to make sure 2007 issue and practice tests are different from 2006 issue."
4,Very helpful,"My daughter found this book to be helpful in her studying to get a higher score on both tests. She found subjects in this book that wasn't reviewed in her regular classwork. Because of that, she didn't go into her tests ""blinded"" by subjects she didn't know."
4,"Witty, Charming and Warm","This is a GREAT little indie. It has a fairly simple plot which sends the characters running around NYC one night at Christmas time - each with his or her own misunderstanding of what is going on. The dialogue is warm and witty and the actors are wonderful. There is not one bad perfomance in this film. Campbell Scott and the late Katrin Cartlidge make a very enagaging duo as they spar and flirt their way through the evening. Eric Stoltz is a great warm-hearted heel and Kelly gets a chance to deliver some great one-liners and zingers that give her character a real zest. This is the kind of small, sweet, funny film that doesen't get made that often and when they do - rarely this well. Spend and hour and a half with this one and make some new friends. I have honestly ended up curled up on the couch watching this more times than I ever imagined. Get it!"
4,Such a fun story to watch unfold in front of you,"I watched this movie ...and once it finished I decided I had to log on to Amazon and buy it up. This film is so well done, from the characters, the actors, the dialogue and the stories. A pure enjoyment to watch. I hope everyuone sees it at least once."
4,One of the great Christmas movies of all time!,"If you, like me, think of Lethal Weapon, Die Hard, and The Ref are a great way to ring in the season, grab this movie. It has humor for anybody to enjoy, and cajoles the seasonal curmugeon in all of us. It is a semi-chick flick, but guys should like it too."
5,great looking flag for a low price,fast delivery and a great looking flag with bold colors. Left it out in the rain - no running or fading. Why pay $20 or more at Wally Mart?
3,Not one of the best midwest compilations,"This compilation album starts out very nicely. The intro sets the mood right, while the following two tracks are very good. When you hit the 4th track, things seem to go downhill. Everything else seems mediocre and the only standouts are the CWAL Ballaz, the Newsense remix, Triple Darkness, Iffy Stokes, Twista, and that's about. The Psycho Drama song is available for download from Psycho Drama's website and has appeared in numerous other mixtapes. The last song with E.C. Illa is also worth checking out. Unless you're a die-hard fan of Chicago and Midwest music, you won't find much to like here."
5,This Book Will Make You Angry,William Gairdner details methodically the flawed thinking that has taken Canada down the road to it's current mediocre existence. Gairdner ruthlessly gores every sacred cow the elites have created in this country from socialized medicine to official bilingualism and multiculturalism as state policy.
5,Great! Reminds me of a Montessori work,"My son has been in a Montessori school environment since 17 months and really thrived in this environment vs. regular daycare. I was inspired by the works the children did and wanted to find some things for home that were similar to what he did at school. The 2-piece puzzles are perfect in that it's matching one half to the other...just like things he did at school. He is now 3, and these are still great for him. Highly recommend!"
5,21 Month Old Loves It,we also have the set that has the tails you match to the animals. She really enjoys both.
5,Best puzzle for 18 mos. +,"My son really enjoys this puzzle, as well as the others by the same brand."
3,So-So,I did not enjoy this book as some others that I have read about the Acadians. There were too many references to percentages & numbers making it read like an accountants journal.
1,NO! NO! NO!,"Save your money! This is the most cumbersome shredder I have ever used. The shredder top is very heavy and difficult to remove when emptying the basket and is very prone to paper jams, no matter the number of sheets inserted. The basket leaves the shredded paper exposed for children and pets to pull out onto the floor. Very poor design. I gave this one away and purshased another model. Again, save your $$$$$$!"
2,Can't recommend this one,"This shredder is a bit louder and more cumbersome than I was hoping for. It does shred just fine and never has jammed, but definitely has an industrial-strength whirring when it's running. One major problem: the auto shutoff sensor quit working after about a month of use and now it runs continously until you switch it off. I'd rather have gotten a quieter unit with a larger wastebasket."
2,Not very good,"I am far from impressed with this shredder. The automatic feed function broke the first month. Despite never feeding it more than 3 light sheets of paper or 1 heavy sheet of paper at a time and cleaning/oiling it monthly or more, it has died right before the 2 year point. In addition, the can portion is ridiculously small and the shredded paper constantly backs up and clogs the shredder."
1,Waste of money,"You get less than you pay for with this. Jams continually and after using it just a few times, it's completely died."
4,Good for light use,"This does the job for a personal shredder to chop up bills, receipts, that sort of thing. Not heavy duty enough for large jobs and not for people in a rush--2 to 4 sheets at a time--max.Sensor tends to cloud over and machine will run all the time--rather than automatically turn off. Can try to clean the sensor if you want but again--for light use--flick it on--shred and turn it off. I have had mine for 2 years or so.Now that I am cleaning out the basement and need to shred years of pointlessly saved canceled checks and old, old, old tax papers--I purchased a more potent machine--but with the occasional oil treatment--this does the job for personal use.Don't expect to overtax it and it'll fit the need."
3,Not for use with extended cab,"As another reviewer mentioned, the information about whether this fits your vehicle isn't perfect. This came up as a fit for my 2007 F350 Extended Cab. Got it quick as always, however, after a quick review of the instructions that said to roll down the rear windows to install the back parts I feared this wasn't going to work after all for an extended cab that has push out windows rather than roll down rear windows. A quick check to see if there was a way it would go in with the back window pushed out in the open position confirmed that suspicion. Note this review has nothing to do with the quality of the product itself - that seems okay though I haven't / can't use it enough to really be able to say accurately (just my observation from looking at it). If you have a truck that doesn't have roll down windows in the back (i.e. a crew cab rather than extended cab), you are likely to find this isn't going to work."
1,"BUYER BEWARE - Amazon ""make sure it fits"" feature inaccurate! This is for newer model fords","As the title says, I used Amazon's ""Make sure it fits!"" feature and that is inaccurate. I purchased these for my 2005 Ford F250 Super Duty Extended Cab and it does not fit it. These looks like they fit the newer model fords f150s or f250s. Sorry I had to give the product itself a bad review but your fault for not clearing this up with amazon or in the product description..."
5,WOW!!,"My husband, Jon Provost, directed a stage version of Outback years ago. He insisted I read it and I am so lucky he did. It is brilliant. It's a grand adventure, inspiring, exhausting, spiritual, full of humor and wisdom. If you've ever dreamed of visiting Australia, or you've been lucky enough to go, or you just long to be transported to another land without ever leaving your chair -- Outback is for you."
2,Not sturdy,"I bought one of these. It didn't really hold up. It was cheap though, so I guess it's a tossup."
4,It is a drill bit,"I've been drilling holes in my concrete basement floor for sole plates for use with tap cons. The drill bits work fine for this job and with a heavy duty hammer drill they make quick work of this activity. All I can be critical of is that I have snapped 3 of the 5 that I have bought in the process of drilling about 150 holes. So if you have a lot of holes to drill, I would make sure you have backups."
5,Good quality,My wife prefers gartered stocking over pantyhose for the comfort and she says these are a great value and wear well and look good.
4,"If you're on the borderline, get the shorter stockings!","I am 5'6"", 130 lbs, and I opted for the shorter stockings. I'm glad I did, as the larger size would've been WAY too long. These have a nice feel to them, and although I've only worn them once, they seem as though they'll last a while. I'm happy with the purchase."
3,What I used to buy,"If you are one of those people that fit into ""one size fits all"" tights, then these are for you. They are durable, and are nice on the skin, but they are too short for me. My garter get pulled down slowly with these, so I have to continually readjust them throughout the day."
5,Large and lovely ladybug,This bright and colorful ladybug makes a 'smart' impact in my garden. Larger than I expected and so beautifully designed...she makes a lovely addition to my growing collection of whimsical garden art.
4,works great & helps my aching joints,"I have had these before and once the massager burns out, I always come back to Homedics and purchase another one. They always seem to make me feel better and I would be lost without one."
3,Homedics therapist select massager,"I purchased this massager after my previous homedics massager stopped working after 4 years of weekly use. This massager has a much shorter cord than the previous one I owned and now I realize how nice it was to have the extra cord length. The power is decent but it would be nice to have a third, more powerful, option. Well built but needs a longer cord and more power."
1,Bad Experiece w/Percussion Massager & Universal Mania,"First Homedics Percussion Massager w/ Heat I received did not work. I contacted the seller, paid for return shipping and received a 2nd massager w/ heat. The heat funstion did not and still does not work. In my over all opinion this is a bad item and the seller I used, Universal Mania, is terrible. I unnecessarily paid for shipping 3 times to receive 3 broken massagers. They will not fully refund my money or the 2 additional shipping I have paid. 3 out of 3 of these Homedics Percussion Massagers w/ Heat have not worked and I am stuck with the 3rd one with no refund from Universal Mania.My next step will be to go through Amazon is self for resolution.C."
2,Not sold as advertised!!!!,"This product is advertised as having 4 sets of removable heads: heat, hard, medium and soft. The one I received only came with soft and heated heads. Good product otherwise, but false advertising."
2,Good at first but too klunky to manage,"Bought this after a friend recommended this product to me a few years back. It was ok at first as I wanted to get cheap massages sitting at home, but after a while it did not do what it was supposed to. The heat setting fixtures were a waste of money."
2,Small and little power,This massager is small and has little power. The heat is very little amount. Does not have an automatic shut off and can over heat. Would not recomend this product.
5,Amazing Indie effort!,"I was turned onto Room Full of Walters back in the early 90's when they played gigs in Kansas City. An amazing stage presence and musicianship.This CD is their second release following ""Wonderful"" Another treasure if you can find it.I am still amazed that this early line up of the band didn't break into the mainstream.Excellent power pop from Wichita!"
2,Try something else....,"It's for sure that this is not the best ""Titan"" available. It seems that the studio recording makes it a bit sterile. It may be that the engineers thought that they had to do with a quartet recording... As for the interpretation, Mehta's reading is decent but rather uncharacteristic. Try Horenstein, Bernstein, Walter or even Boulez...."
1,Jonathan is correct,"What a travesty. Mehta's insipid reading of the 1st coupled with the Szell is bad enough. To not include all of the Szell makes this an also-ran. Hopefully, Sony will eventually realize their mistake and reissue the Szell, perhaps as part of the Heritage Masterworks series in cleaned-up sound."
2,"somewhat ""chatty"" and commercialized","The book does have some good information though I hesitate to recommend it to the serious student. It is a brief account obviously kept in terms best suited for beginners (or very very old people perhaps).Personally I cried hieroglyphs at the author's annoying attempts to set the whole system of Egyptian magic up as a springboard to theories about visitors from Sirius and magic associated with that. I have no idea why we _must_ toss such things as Atlantis, Sirius, aliens or etc into the mix here.I know it's alot to ask in such a short book, but I would have prefered more 'hard' info, less chat and fewer attempts to flog the author's next book."
4,The blood will show...,"Todd McCaffrey has provided us with a well-written and interesting glimpse in to the life of his mother. There are some questions not answered, and much left unsaid -- but it is clear that this is done out of respect and consideration for his mother. The book is short, but once you pick it up you can't put it down. This book is as much a biography of Anne McCaffrey as recollections of Todd's own childhood. Through Todd McCaffrey and this book, you can appreciate and understand the problems that Anne McCaffrey overcame to achieve what she has achieved. And this is certainly an excellent book for aspiring writers who believe that if they can just get one book published, they've got it made, and not to give up if the first book or story story is declined. Todd McCaffrey did a great job!"
2,I was hoping for more,"As a huge Anne McCaffrey fan, I purchase all things Anne, and I was looking forward to reading about her life. Although there are great (short) stories about different times in Anne's life, her son Todd has not assembled them in chronological order, and the book only hits the ""highlights"". The jumping about chronologically was distracting. I hope Anne writes her full autobiography. She's a much better storyteller. I'd recommend this only for true Anne fans."
2,Bust,"Biography format. Did not hold my interest very long. Nothing all that extraordinary. It sounded a lot like my family except that Anne wrote books, instead of being a truly exemplary secretary like my mom was."
5,Amazon scores again!,"I looked for the same book on ebay and the seller wanted $56 for it! A book that would cost, perhaps $13 from SFBC. I certainly can't say the book was read before but it looks brand new for a fraction of the cost."
5,Great templates!,Specially for teachers who are teaching their students into thinking strategies.Amazing what you can do with these ideas in preschool as well!!
4,moisturizer,This is a excellent oil in the winter time or if you have dry skin. It soaks into the skin and leaves it soft and glowing.
2,not great,"This sandal does not look as good in person. It seems cheap, and the sizing is more narrow and smaller than expected."
4,nightwalk - rick braun,"Another fine album by rick braun. His music is new to my collection. I now have 4 of his albums. Very easy to listen to, especially after a hard day's work. So glad I have discovered him."
5,Very Happy!!,I was so happy to come across this book. I first found it at the library. It's everything I could ever want in a snake book and more. Fantastic picture quality and detail!! Great illustration and resource guide.
5,Fusion 101,"A greatest hits collection, Primal Tracks contains selections from Tribal Tech's first 4 albums, and serves as a good starting point for new listeners. The one complaint is the usual one for a greatest hits disc - that they didn't include several of my favorite songs. Nonetheless, the collection is representative of Tribal Tech's early output, and provides precedent for their future direction (which has grown more improvisational and less ""written""). This disc also has value in that it contains tracks from Tribal Tech's discontinued catalog, all of which are difficult to find elsewhere. Every tune here is a treasure; harmonically rich and ceaselessly inventive. This one should whet your appetite for more."
3,What we have here is a failure to communicate,"These are some talented guys with absolutely nothing to say. This is the souless sound of machinery played by faceless technicians with nary an original idea and not a bit of real emotion either, unless overly complex and overlplayed compositions and faceless shredding could be considered emotional. I wouldn't be surprized if all the musicians were Berklee grads, otherwise know as the School For The Obliteration Of Personality, for the lack of individuality displayed either in the playing or compositions. It's all so mechanical and all so predictible."
3,"talented guys, but...","I liked a couple of the tunes on ""Dr. Hee"", so I thought I'd check out this compilation. Unfortunately, I still only liked a couple of the tracks that were from ""Dr. Hee"". The compositions are just too abstract...guess I'm just more of a 4 progression per song kind of guy."
1,torn book!!!,I bought a book and unfortunately it was torn from the cover to page 45!!!! I will try to get a new book or my money back. Very disappointing.
2,Dont know why its on DVD,This would look like something you would see on the Sci-Fi Channel. Its a 2 DVD set in the first one there are 3 episodes even has a mini interview with Former WWE Diva Shelly Martinez. Disc 2 have 3 episodes aswell with a few extras. For DVD you would expect more. Its a better fit for tV than DVD
1,Malte Burba Master Class,"Agree with the 2 reviews previously written. It's more than deceptive, it's useless. I guess I need to haul in the little old German lady from down the street to translate. Don't say you can select English if it doesn't translate every word into English."
2,"Unless you speak fluent German, don't bother","The DVD is basically one long video of a talking head (Mr. Burba, I believe). If the head were talking English it wouldn't be so bad but the head speaks German.If you select the English version at the start of the DVD you get a few English sub titles scattered through but not enough to matter, its still a German speaking talking head. There are some demos but they are introduced and summarized by Mr. Burba but, again, the summarization is in German so its impossible to understand what is being demoed and why. The DVD packaging has paragraphs in English and German, side by side, but this is deceptive."
1,Sprechen sie deutsche? If not . . .,"You're offered one option for German or English, prior to the introduction. You get English subtitles, which is okay. After the intro, you get the guru in German. One subtitle every five minutes or so. If you speak German, this is probably a valuable DVD. Come on, Amazon, you should have told us this in the blurb. Again -- if you don't speak German, don't buy this."
4,a awesome country album you cant live without,"it starts with a song regarded as the best country song ever called you never even call me by my name.oops!its there but its second.a definitive down and dirty david allen coe song cheap thrills.its awesome.theres some ballads and a song all about getting drunk called jack daniels if you please.the album has some good songs,im just commenting on the best few.the last song is if that aint country ill kiss your .............well you know.it meticously describes his young life.this song i think defines country music.every david allen coe fan should own this one."
5,"Fun For Vegetarians Or Sci-Fi Fans, Double For Both","I bought this book after seeing Battlestar Galactica for the first time as an adult(a lazy Sunday afternoon, a cable tv marathon ).When I was 14 I moved away from being a hard core sci-fi fan and got into a whole lot of ""Eastern Stuff"" ( karate, vegetarianism, meditation, tai-chi, yoga etc ). It was pretty neat to read how an actor from one of my favorite child hood shows also got on a similar path.I don't agree with all of Mr. Benedict's views on women and nutrition, but given that he grew up in the 60s and got cancer in the 70's I can understand them. From reading the book he sounds like a pretty cool guy all the same.The book has a great message. I enjoyed reading it. Anyone who is a veggie or who was a Battlestar Galactica fan will enjoy reading it too."
4,A Unique Perspective on Health,"Having worked in the alternative health industry for 12 years, and studied it for 17 years, I read the book having been on a similar journey as the author's. His is a very unique telling of such a tale. The first time I read the book when it was first published, I didn't agree with or understand some of his points on health or the way he was presenting them, but experience has shown me more clarity.His is not a 'how-to' instruction book, and he gives clear reasons for why it is so. His is rather a book on his own ideas, and someone following in his footsteps will have different experiences and find different truths working for them.And his insigts into why he still experiences physical discomforts provides great words for dealing with those types of questions one on this journey encounters from those outside.And ordering it from Amazon is a great idea.

4,Gigabeat 10 GB,This MP3 player is very nice. But there are a few things that could be changed.the contorls could be easier to use. the touch control does not work as good as an ipod. It seems like you have to hold the power button forever to turn it on or off. and once a song is playing i can't figure out how to get back to the playlist without going through the whole menu. On a better note the screen looks very nice and is the reason i bought it. The battery lasts a very long time. and the software is easy to use once you get the hang of it. the dock is also very functional.
4,Toshiba Gigabeat 10 GB,"I think this player works very well. The sound is great! It holds songs and photos! You can back up a digital camera to it if you want to get your files off the memory card, but don't have a computer!I have few minor problems with this. The first is that there does not seem to be a way to delete pictures from the player; you have to install the Gigabeat Room software and open the photo viewer to delete pictures. Very cumbersome, and this is not explained in the manual. The second problem is that when you play in random mode, you cannot ""reverse the track"" to get any previous track played.These are the only problems I have, otherwise I think this is a fine player. You can bookmark, which I assume is for audio books, although I have not done this. The graphics are wonderful. I do not regret the decision to buy this player, and I am glad I have it!"
4,Surprising and cheap device,"I have just bought this mp3 player and I think that is more than expected. The quality of sound is great, spite of the fact that I have to buy other headphones. The resolution of the display amazed me!!!. The interaction with it is very intuitive, but could be greatly improved, especially the menu's access. I think that the price worth. Everyone compares any mp3 player with iPOD, due to the fact that iPOD was the first mp3 player on its category (not the best one), but this toshiba is far away from what I have seen on iPOD. I broadly reccommend to pruchase it."
3,Alright Value,I'm the kind of guy who listens to his MP3 Player constantly. More than 6 hours a day. This product is alright and is not really worth the money.Pros: Pictures and music. Plays both WMA and MP3. Nice screen and easy to use. Sound quality is alrightCons: The Gigaroom(software) sucks and is not as good as Musicmatch and iTunes. The casing is easily broken. Can't make playlists on the player. Can't look at playlist with out going to the main menu.It's annoying and an iPod or even a Dell Jukebox will be worth more of your money. Just do your research and be careful what you buy.
4,Toshiba Gigabeat 10 GB player,"Pros: Easy set up..easy song and pic transfer..lcd screen has excellent quality..transfering songs can be done numerous ways..ie...software..WMP..drag and drop in explorer..sound quality is very goodCons: doesn't have the ability to make a playlist without connecting to the PC..supplied headphones sounded very good but where a bit large and hard to get to stay in my ears(I suggest Koss ""the Plug"" or Koss ""the Sparkplug"" earbuds"
3,wrong color,i got this they day amazon said it would get shipped out not the day it was suppose to arive but thats a good thing i guess. It cama and i was so exicited then i opened it up and it was a light blue modle not a black but i was all right with it because color dont matter that much.. software sucks !!!!!!!!!!! but i just use windows media player
5,Love it....and it is adorable to boot!,I have had it for about a month now and I have not had any problems. The software is simple (i.e. I figured it out right away on my own without the help of my computer nerd brother) and the sound is great. I can't think of anything to complain about. I think it works better than an ipod (not to mention the much better price) and it is not the same thing everyone else has. Great for fellow nonconformists that love music. Hope this helped. Have a great day!
2,Good when new,"This remote was inexpensive and worked well with my TV, VCR and DVD player.After about 2 years buttons stopped working well. Now, about 2.5 years from purchase, it is almost impossible to switch between devices and even turn the power on."
3,"Great spoons, as long as you wash them by hand.","I purchased these for my wife for Christmas one year and I discovered a nasty problem with silver, detergents cause discoloration and speck and corrosion to the spoons.I suggest washing these spoons by hand with a mild detergent if you want them to maintain their brilliance. Also be careful what silver polish you use if you wish to shine these spoons, make sure you choose a non-toxic one.BTW silver by tarnishes when left out in the sun, Silver is photo-sensitive, its why they used to use silver for photography."
1,Poor quality,They are all pitted and do plating is chipping off. They didn't even last 6 months before they became ugly looking.
3,mixed feelings,"i bought this cd an while ago and never wrote a review, but since i rely so heavily on these review, i figured i better give back. here goes.some of this cd is phenominal, and some of it could be passed over. not that its not good, just not to my taste. i tend to gravitate more to the soft, drastic contrast between the bamboo flute and the koto, but more soothing sound. the only problem with this cd is that it goes from something like this to a drum routine, that while isnt bad, is so diffrent that is doesnt flow well. id rather use the drum tracks as one cd, and the other music as another.so in a way, if you have no real idea what types of japanese music you like but you are curious, this is a great cd because it gives a great variety and from this you can isolate sounds you like and shop more educated. in this way it does serve a great purpose, but only temporarily for me...once i found the tracks i liked, i added them to a playlist on my laptop and hardly use the disc anymore."
3,Nice but..,"This is a nice cd, but sincerly how can you name it ""very best of japanese music"" ?? Go to natsumelo.com & you'll see that there is many other thing beside koto & taiko drums"
4,It was exactly what I was looking for.,"It was exactly what I was looking for. Nice, relaxing CD that I find get me relaxed and calmed down."
4,Very old idea is losing coherency,"Although I do find this sort of format to be an easy place for a quick reference, the concept of a ""quick and easy"" gathering of important tables is rapidly losing all sorts of usefulness as more and more changes are brought into the system."
5,One Stop...,"If you have been DMing for a long time, since 1st edition like me, then this makes the DMG pointless. Currently it is the only DM's Guide printed by TSR that I use. It puts everything you need right on hand. Basically if you go through the DMG and cut out all the important tables and paste them on a piece of cardboard you have got this screen. It is as needed to me as a DM as my dice...need i say more?"
4,Very useful,"This is a very help set of screens,although I no longer play. Mine are for the first edition."
3,Clossic Gypsy Jazz,To learn and preserve the classic Django a gypsy Jazz. this in a valuable trace in history and a good teaching aid.
2,Needs polishing,"I was required to get this book for a class. My biggest gripe with it is that there are lots of typos and it seems as though the book did not go through an editing staff to clean it up. Also, there are a lot ""fluff"" sentences in the text that are merely opinions and do not add to the reader's technical understanding of the material. I would not recommend purchasing this book if you just wanted it as a reference."
1,Poorly written,"I was required to buy this book for one of my classes. As a straight-A student this has been, by far, the worst written educational books I have studied. There are blatant errors in the math examples. It may be translation errors on the publisher's behalf but I find the book doesn't flow easily or understandably. If any teacher is thinking of using this book for their class then be well prepared to re-explain everything to the class."
5,Knowledge for a new world,"Knowing the helth damages that solid wastes can do if they are not correctly disposed, is an important way of preserving our world. Nothing is more important than preserving our health. Some contaminant problems are irreversible ! Wake up now!José Ribeiro Aires Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"
1,Worst complexity book ever,THis is my textbook so I don't have a choice but it is horribly written and completely unintelligible. I had to go get a different text from the library.
3,A good but not essential SHOW BOAT,An original cast recording of the 1940s version of SHOW BOAT. Originally on 78 RPMS the sound is somehwat dated. The cast is adequate but the recording fails to generate much genuine excitement.Better recordings: Sony's 1964 studio cast with John Raitt & Barbara Cook; the 1993 Toronto cast starring Rebecca Luker; and EMI's complete 3 CD set that recreates the original 1927 version.
5,What A Great Album,"This may seem like a low budget album but its one of my favorites....Have you ever been to a party and people kept talking over the music? Well this cd is guaranteed to have the whole party listening attentively to the witty lyrics and amazing chord progressions. A must have for any elvis fan. I can't wait for Jimmy to cut a new album, although nothing can top the first."
1,KJV apologist,If you are looking for a balanced scholarly explanation on Bible versions - This isn't it. It is an apology for the King James Version ony.
5,BEST BIBLE VERSION COMPARISON BOOK,This was the very first of many bible verse books that we have read. It was the first and the best. Do you ever wonder why there are so many different bible versions? Aren't they all the same? Didn't they all come from one source? Why do certain bible versions elliminate scripture? You will be shocked and amazed at the truth. A must read for anyone seeking the truth.
4,Chocolate Cookies Are For Dessert,"Anyone with a picky eater will enjoy this book. While it certainly didn't improve my son's picky eating habits, it brings a smile to his face each time we read it! However, I would have appreciated more encouragement for children to ""eat your vegetables"" and save the chocolate cookies for dessert."
3,Great grill but cleanup?,Have used the grill many times and it works great. Very little smoke. The challenge is cleaning the unit without ruining the grill. Foods have a tendency to stick and even with a sponge and much elbow grease it is very difficult to keep perfectly clean. I just used a portable steamer to clean it and that did the trick.
2,It's so-so,"This grill is great except for one thing- the nonstick part wore off and the manufacturer is replacing it. You have to clean it pretty carefully although it doesn't seem like it. As far as it's cooking ability, I would reccommend it- but the quality was fair."
3,Worked great for a while but....,I received this as a Christmas gift in '04. It worked wonderful! It cooked juicy chicken breasts and hamburgers. I only used it it 6 - 8 times and it stopped working!! The light turns on but it does not heat up anymore!
4,Great little Grill,I got this grill at the store when i saw it advertised on the weekly ad. It is a great buy. My favorite thing is being able to grill boneless skinless chicken breasts with no hassle. The only thing i had problem grilling was chicken that has the bone in. Steaks too came out great. Perfect if you are onthe Atkins Diet to add variety. I have yet to try Kabobs. :)
5,EXCELLENT GRILL!!,"I have been searching for an indoor grill, but have been very reluctant to invest in one, for fear that the food would not be to my liking. Boy, was I in for a pleasant surprise!! The first time I used it, was to grill hamburger patties. They were so tender and tasty! My next meal would be to try chicken breast. I was convinced that they would not be tender, but was proven wrong once again. Everything tastes just like off the outdoor grill!! I even Marinated some chicken breasts in a Fajita Marinade. They were Fabulous!! The best purchase I have made in a long time!!! Also, the recipe book that accompany's the grill is very good."
1,Not recommended,"Regret purchasing it. It is not user friendly as the iPOD. Like the old Sony software, Toshiba seems to be afraid of people stealing copyrighted music where it becomes a pain to load in your own music. There is no drag-and-drop which would makes things a lot easier. Toshiba can correct the problem like Sony did by updating their software, making it more intuitive. Until it does, which is not likely, I do not recommend you purchasing this product."
2,Bulky and does not play audiobooks from audible.com,"I purchased this item some days ago but returned it later on to amazon. I purchased it because it was a lot of space for the money. A 30GB IPod almost costs 50-60% more and I didnt have a big collection of audio anyway. But the controls are not user friendly and most importantly I returned it because it did not play the audible.com format which is the most popular audiobook format. When I bought it, it was really from a reluctance to buy ipod because the ipod was so common place but I finally succumbed and bought the Nano which I realized is a fine product after all. Also keep in mind that because this has a spinning hard disk its not a good idea to use it in the gym, especially on a treadmill. Its better to buy a flash drive based product that does not have moving parts, thats why I finally got the Nano."
3,Too green for me.,I have Zoisite earrings and a pendant that have a good mix of the pink with the green. This one had very dark green stones in it so I did return it. Just not my style.
5,"Yep, this works in the PSP","I've personally verified this: this 256MB Memory Stick PRO Duo works in the Sony PSP as well as in the latest Sony digital cameras and camcorders. It's very fast in speed and very reliable. Just handle it with care as it's tiny and thin.Now, in order to play copy-protected digital content you buy from Sony's Connect music store, you'll need to install the latest PSP firmware update. The initial firmware (v1.00) did not support MagicGate digital rights management.For ultimate performance and reliability when it comes to Memory Stick Duo cards, I recommend Sony. There are too many reports of reliability issues with Sandisk cards."
3,Too fast for beginners,As someone that has been in the martial arts for yrs and never really did yoga i thought it would be a great place to start. The pace of the DVD is a little fast for beginners. There are no subtitles so slowing the video down is pointless since you can not hear what they are saying. There is a lot of good info but not really a first yoga DVD.
4,Great case,"I was skeptical when I ordered this case. I had used Rhinoskin products in the past with much success, so I took a leap of faith on this one. I am not disappointed.Before I inserted my iPod Nano, I used Q-tips and alcohol to clean the inside of the clear plastic, and I made sure the face of my nano was clean. I carefully slid the nano inside the case.I did not get any scratches on the ipod.I was afraid the nano would fall out since there is nothing strapped along the bottom. However, the rubber pads inside hold the nano very snuggly. I even held the case by the clip and shook it, yet the nano did not even budge a millimeter.I also like that the clip is removeable.I use the Bose iPod speaker dock with this nano. The one negative is the case needs to either be taken off, or the adapter that fits over the docking opening needs to be removed. I chose to remove the adapter.I have no regrets with this product thus far."
2,"Okay, but heavy","The Rhinoskin case works fine. The nano fits well in the case. No problems getting it in and out. My issue with the case is the weight. I'm just guessing b/c I don't have tech specs, but it feels like it makes the nano twice as heavy. One of things I was so excited about when I got my nano was that it was so light. This case takes the joy out of that. Don't get me wrong; it's still pretty light. But other all-plastic cases I've tried don't test the elastic on my shorts as much as this one does."
1,Scratches!!!,Horrible - the first time I slid my nano into the case it put several scratches on the front; defeats the purpose for even buying it. I would recommend getting an Agent 18 case.
1,Skin that scratches your Nano,"I've bought this Rhinoskin hoping to protect my brand new Nano... but since this is a slide in design, it SCRATCHED my never been used Nano's menu button. COMMENTS: NEVER BUY THIS IF YOU DON'T WANT TO SCRATCH YOUR iPOD NANO (assumming you would be sliding your nano in and out of the case for more than ones!)"
1,Not good,"I am not impressed with the rhinoskin. The case was designed very poorly. The most glaring defect is the inaccessibility of the hold button, which is used to prevent changes in volume and songs when exercising. To get at it, I've found it necessary to take the nano out of the case which defeats the purpose of having the case. In addition the clip is difficult to use because it's so stiff and heavy. The lanyard is not adjustable and is made out of a thin elastic. Though I haven't had problems with the case scratching my nano, it's not surprising that's an issue given the other problems. Save your money or buy something else."
5,pink,i love it and it matches all my other pink kitchenAid items. works very well and has multiple settings. A+++
2,not worth it,"While the back cover suggests that the book is about Connie helping the detective (Rand) search for her friend's husband (Troy), the reality laid out in chapter after chapter is that her motivation in finding Troy is due to Connie's attraction that has lingered since the two had dated in high school. I found this to be an extremely distracting (and unsatisfying) premise since it had been nearly 9 years since they'd dated AND Troy has been married to Connie's ""best friend"" for the past 6 years. There isn't any between-the-sheet action, but other than that, it did not live up to what I've come to expect in the ""Love Inspired"" books."
1,Corneal Burn,"I guess you get what you pay for, I was not familiar with the brand name, but figued it was cheap, and Amazon.com has a great return policy if not satisfied (Thank God) This thing is a total pile of * it looks, feels, and even smells cheap. So again back to you get what you pay for, I plugged it in and low and behold it had a black square about the size of a dime that would not go away, when I called Corn ea they told me they all LCD Monitors have some dead pixels, but mine was the size of a dime, and that most monitor and laptop companies will not let you return an item unless it has more than 12 dead pixels, again mine was the size of a dime and very noticable, and annoying. Needless to say, I returned the monitor to Amazon.com, but I always hate re-packing the item up, and then having to go to the post office. But it went back, and I got a credit, I will ask the computer guy at work what he recomends and then come back and order a monitor from Amazon.com based on his recomendations."
5,Excellent translation and commentary of this scripture,"I've read many translations of the Bhagavad-Gita; they range from mediocre to horrendous. Eknath Easwaran, however, has made this scripture not only accessible, but warm and inviting. The language is lucid, though always challenging. Even more helpful is Easwaran's extensive commentary on each verse of the Gita. He modernizes this scripture, and shows how very pertinent it is in today's turbulent world. Sri Easwaran is quite likeable--very funny, gentle, and unpretentious. The Bhagavad-Gita, simply put, is a book of two choices, and their consequences. It does not have a lot of do's and dont's, nor does it lead the reader to feel inferior or degraded. This book, in short, has tremendously shaped my life, and I believe it has the power to also do so for anyone who is lonely, confused, or simply wants some kind of guidance to lead them through life. Buy all three books; it will, I promise, be one of the best investments you'll ever make."
2,No really about the Gita,"I like the comments. But there are two problems. First, it is very repetitive. Second, it is not really a commentary on the Gita but instead the author talks about how we can became better persons in a fashion unrelated to the Gita text."
1,A nice place to start.,"This is one of several editions of the Bhagavad Gita I have studied. Mr. Eswaran has taken this 5000 year old classic and inserted his commentaries with the translations. While his commentaries are nice, they do get a bit repetetive.I have read several books by Mr. Eswaran including all three volumes of this Gita and all of the books are very predictable. After reading one, you know what the rest are going to say.This edition is also NOT TRUE TO THE ORIGINAL SANSKRIT. It has been changed to fit our middle class sensabilities. The problem that arrises with this is that subtle and not so subtle meanings get lost or completely overlooked. It is a nice Gita to start with, but the best translation I have found is BHAGAVAD GITA AS IT IS by Swami Prabhupada.Sorry, I just was not impressed with the integeraty of this work."
5,Heartwarming story,Colt is a disabled boy who suffers from spina bifida that makes him unable to get around without a wheelchair most of the time. He also suffers (in his opinion) from getting a new father after his biological dad left him and his mom when the disability was revealed by the doctors.Overall the story was well done; it made you relate to the main character without feeling sorry for him and really showed that horses and kids can accomplish just about anything together. I recommend this book to any person assisting at a disabled riding stable.Recommended reading age: 8-12 yrs.
2,Author should be a Tech Rep,"I've definately read better computer forensics books. 90% of the applications that the author recommends and describes how to use are not downloadable and cannot be purchased in a software store! All the links point to a 'contact a sales agent today!' This makes me ask, ""Is Bruce a paid spokesperson for Forensics-Intl.com""Additionally the author goes from very basic information to very complex information, leaving out very important middle information. I've been working with computers for more than 17 years and if I found this book to be somewhat cryptic, a newbie isn't going to understand any of the critical information that he/she should know before attempting to perform any kind of computer forensics."
5,Great floor mat.,"This floormat works great in my 2003 Chevy Silverado. It covers the front floorboards completely and protects the carpet underneath. It's a little thinner than some mats I considered, but for the price, I love it!"
4,Caution,The other comments referring to weight gain are entirely true. I have used this device repeatedly with spuds and the fryer and put on some pounds. It is worth it! The kids love it.
2,Safety holder is not included.,"I have purchased many items from Amazon and this is the first that I am disappointed in. Although I have yet to used it, it would be crazy to do so with the safety holder that is in the picture. It's like buying a car off the showroom floor because that's the one you like and when you pick itup the radio is missing because it doesn't come with it.Börner V-Wave Waffle Slicer"
2,Photo misleading - safety holder NOT included,"The slicer does a good job on making waffle cut potatoes, which is what I wanted, but the safety holder (shown in the photo of the item) is not included, and there is no warning that this must be bought separately. The first instruction is ""Alway use safety holder,"" which is a good instruction, and therefore the buyer should be warned ahead of time that it is not included - or else the holder should not appear in the picture of the product.The potato goes into the slicer fairly easily to start, but it is rather difficult to get it to go all the way through for a complete slice. Perhaps if I had the safety holder, slicing would be easier. If you have another mandoline that uses the same safety holder, then you probably would not need to buy one, but unfortunately this was not the case for me."
4,Waffle Slicer,"I am very satisfied with this product, it is easy to make waffle potatoes chips with this slicer. I was able to slice large potatoes without the holder and use the holder for the last pieces to avoid cutting my fingers."
3,"Not all ""Northwest Coast""","Great, yet another book about ""Northwest Coast"" and ""Coast Salish"" art that ignores the art of the Salish Indians of Western Washington. Ever since J. E. Standley flooded the Seattle tourist market with the fake Kwakiutle artwork, fake totem poles, and other hybrids of art forms from the northern coast Salish tribes, the art forms that are indigenous to our tribes here in western Washington have been all but forgotten, brushed aside by authors who chase the market with books that pretend to deal with all ""of the Northwest Coast"" but in reality ignore anything south of the 49th Parallel."
5,Great learning tool,"I purchased this book when I was new to learning about NW indian art. This book was very helpful to me in developing my own original art as it is rich with many fine examples of work produced by masters, and contains excellent commentary to go with it. As I continue to develop my own art, I find I keep going back to this book as a reference tool. There are other excellent books out there on this art form, but I would highly recommend this as one of the few you pick up to get started learning about it."
4,The visual Totem Poles,"Hello from Barcelona:This book shows all the different animal and motifs typologies found at the northwest coast indian totem poles, houses and boxes decorations. Great explanation and examples, designs and variations.Perfect if you already know a bit of the main subject or just want to learn the aesthetic and the visuals: not enough if you want to understand the art and the culture behind the northwest coast.By the way, all the examples shown are mostly draws and illustrations."
3,First recording of show pleasant but no stunner,"After Columbia's studio cast recording of PAL JOEY proved a smash hit, record producer Goddard Lieberson produced a number of other Rodgers and Hart shows with studio casts - Mary Martin in BABES IN ARMS, ON YOUR TOES and this first recording of their best score THE BOYS FROM SYRACUSE. Jack Cassidy and Portia Nelson are acceptable but the numbers are recorded with less pizzazz than the 1965 Off Broadway revival and with less artistry than the 1997 reincarnation. Either of these is the first choice. The mono sound does not hamper this recording however - another Columbia marvel in sound recording. Portia Nelson's wobble may annoy (as did Hanley's in the 1965 revival)but all in all the recording is an acceptable if less than first choice."
5,Best version,"There have been several revivals of The Boys From Syracuse, and in each one the music seems to have deteriorated. This version is taken from the original 1938 score and is true to the Jazz Age/Tin Pan Alley roots of the music. Arguably, Rodgers and Hart's best collaboration and without a doubt the most authentic of the soundtrack recoprdings."
5,The only pan I ever use,"This is the best pan I have ever used. I cook with it every day. It heats foods quickly and evenly. Although it is not a nonstick pan, I can easily wash out even the stickiest of foods."
3,Thin on content and construction,"I was disappointed by this little book. My two year old loves Thomas, and we certainly support the tank engine and his creators financially, and picked up this little book with a recent order. My son enjoys reading it, but it is a little short, and I must add, is about the thinnest and flimsiest lift-and-peek book that I've ever purchased. The flaps are torn very easily, and don't ""match up"" very well with the pictures underneath. To be fair, there are many flaps, and my little one does enjoy the book, it just isn't made to last very long, unlike most of the same genre."
1,Bad Flaps,Great little book except the pictures under the flaps are totally off. This makes it frustrating for little ones to know what they are looking at. Usually Thomas the tank engine stuff is much better quality.
3,Well loved by my twins-,"My boys absolutely have loved this book... to death. They love lifting the flaps (more than the content of the book.)Not very sturdy, though- this book was torn apart within one week."
4,A Thomas favorite,"My son is 2 and loves Thomas, so I picked this up for him- he loves it!! The story is a little short, but my son loves all the flaps. Most lift-the-flap books we own only have one flap on each page. This one has several, and he gets excited every single time he lifts one to reveal what hides beneath.The book is sturdy: board book material with glossy pages that can be wiped off. The flaps are thin, though and can be easily torn by overzealous toddlers.It's good Thomas fun and if my son is happy, so am I!"
3,"Fun, but only so much","My little one loves Thomas (who doesn't?) so we decided to give this a shot. It's ok. THere isn't much of a story, and he really likes Thomas stories. Pop up books are fun till the kids rip them apart. So a good chocie for die hard Thomas fans, but not really all that exciting overall."
4,Thomas the tank book,My son loves the lift and peek part of this book. There is not much to read in the book though which was dissapointed.
2,Not very interesting,"I bought this book for my 19 month old son because he is a great fan of Thomas, but it hasn't proved to be a hit with him or with me. There isn't much of a storyline, and it's barely worth lifting the (very small) flaps, as the pictures underneath are mostly uninteresting and tiny. The colours are also a bit strange (Bertie the bus is brown), and the text does not show the personality of Thomas or any of the other characters. In terms of lift-the-flap, books like ""Where's Spot"" or ""Spot Goes to the Farm"", with large flaps and clear, colourful pictures underneath are far superior."
3,Virtuoso but no depth,"Katsaris made brilliant recordings of Complete Chopin sonatas and Polonaises also by Sony (sadly out of print), but this recording of Chopin Preludes is one of the worst of his entire discography. His playing has verve and virtuosity, but has no depth or subtlety required for playing these highly poetic pieces. It sounds more like Prokofiev than Chopin at time! Only 3 stars for his quick fingers."
4,Romance in the Eternal City,"A sequel to Belle's action-adventure DARKNESS BEFORE THE DAWN, this new story finds Captain Catherine Phillips agreeing to spend a few days in Rome to watch over her recovering flight attendant, Rebecca Hanson. Feeling responsible for the young woman, Kate plans on an ordinary couple of days keeping Becky company but to their mutual surprise, the stay in the Eternal City soon becomes a magical holiday drawing two souls together and pulling down walls that have been in place for much too long. Featuring strong characterizations with two very likeable leads, Belle's latest also offers that air of excitement, magic and romance that was a part of the classic movie which shares its title. A delightful read - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
1,A waste,I wish followed my instinct and not purchased this book. It was no help in caring for my hair. Most of the information is out-dated.
4,As my Grams would say Kinard put her foot in this book!!!,"Lovely book by Kinard! This book gives great pictures and Ideas of how to style you beautiful ""nappy"" hair! Her tips on hair care are priceless and can keep you from losing your hair with crazing suggestions the ""unnaturals"" will give you! Also if your vegetarian or vegan her practices will not go against your standards!"
2,Disappointed,"First off, kudos to any African American how-to book for females! However, I was more than a bit put off by the numerous PENCIL illustrations in the book. I would've preferred (and expected) professional and color real-life pictures. And more step by step photos as opposed to the ""step 3"" outta 7 steps photos."
3,Facing Reality About Natural Hair.,"Ms.Kinard's book was very informative about hair care. I only gave this book three stars because it really didn't tell me how I can wear my hair naturally. Not everyone can wear braids and braids do begin to diminish your hairline. I must say that she gave excellent ideas on how to take care of your natural hair. I enjoyed the book, but I am a little disappointed because I still do not have a hairstyle for my natural hair which leaves me no choice but to turn to chemical straighteners."
2,Less Than Expected,Some very basic information provided regarding natural hair. Not what I expected from the book.
4,got it going on,I was overjoyed to read the book. After 3 years of debating with myself wanting to get locs and dreading having to live on an island for about 6 months this book was a godsend. I read it cover to cover about 7 times and found a jamaican beautician who started my locs with permed hair. It is true you don't need to have your permed hair cut off to start locs.I started in dec.99 and my hair is longer and healthier than it ever has been and I had shoulder length permed hair. We started with the 2 strand twist and it is locing on its own..in fact my beautician will study under Tulani and get her loctician license in May..I am thrilled to loc my hair and this is the way it will be..people frequently tell me I resemble whoopi goldberg (and this was before locs) and i hear it much more often now. I will be nappy and happy from now on..I say to each his own..loc or not..natural or not..just be at peace with yourself and others.
3,great loc start-up,"from a person who has been natural for the past 6 yrs...the book was very informative on differnet styles to achieve...i'm glad there is a forum out here that touches on natural hair...the book was a great help to start my locs...but, i was very disappointed that there was no information in the book that touched on maintaining the locs...i also found disappointing(nothing new) were the styles...i believe there are more to natural hair than braids, locs & afros...what about the natural styles we see on tv & the products they use to maintain them???"
2,Not what i expected,"I was displeased with the book, I felt it focused way too much on dreadlocks. I wear my hair natural, but I wil never wear it as dreadlocks. It brushed through the tips pf taking care of hair and the pictures were not that clear. Don't get me wrong its a decent book, especially if you want to grow dreads."
3,A How to,"Good book on how to do certain things to natural hair, but I think I'm still going to go have someone show me how to do them. The ""how to"" doesn't really transfer in this book as well as it does in actual ""show how to"""
1,"If you're not into extensions or dreads, this isn't for you.","I was very disappointed with this book. I do not care for the artificial look of extensions & braids, nor do I want to get locked into as drastic a hairstyle as dreads, so I really hoped that Ms. Kinard's book would offer some creative options. I was wrong. She's a hairdresser but the only styles this book presented were extensions, dread locks, and knots. As a Black woman with long, thick, kinky hair, I am still searching for alternate, creative hairstyles that don't involve chemicals, enormous amounts of heat, or styles that cost so much time and money that I'll be reluctant or unable to change them easily. But if you don't mind weaving somebody else's hair into your own, or even trying synthetic or Yak's hair, this book is definitely for you."
5,The Go-Go's At Their Best!,"The 2004 release of God Bless the Go-Go's is the most enjoyable CD album I listen to in a while. One song, ""Daisy Chain"" is an abridged version of their story from the beginning to today. For anyone who is a Go-Go's fan and love their music and videos, this CD is for you."
4,God Bless The Go-Go's for this new studio album!,"I loved the Go-Go's in the 1980's and this comeback effort proves they've still got the beat and the chemistry to make it work! I love the fact that all five of them co-wrote a track together. Until now, the only new songs from them were the 3 then-new tracks on ""Return To the Valley Of The Go-Go's (1994). (Check it out if you can - ""Good Girl"", ""Beautiful"" and ""Whole World Lost Its Head""). Even the latest effort by Belinda, 1999's ""A Place On Earth"" - a hits compilation - included three fabulous then-new tracks, ""Feels Like I've Known You Forever,"" ""All God's Children"" and ""A Prayer For Everyone"" - (check them out, too). I was hoping for a new studio album from her as well, but the Go-Go's return was well worth the wait. ""God Bless.."" is a blessing! My fave tracks are ""Vision Of Nowness,""and ""Apology."" Yes, the ballad, ""Here You Are"" is a nice change of pace from five gals that can really pop-rock. Bless you, Charlotte, Belinda, Gina, Jane & Kathy!"
5,"Damn, I missed these girls...","I had to buy it the day it came out. And I am not disappointed in a single track on the entire album. A little bit vintage Go-Go's, a little bit mature today's girls more comfortable with themselves (Apology; Unforgiven; Throw Me a Curve), even at times a little bit B-52's (Kissing Asphalt; Stuck in My Car).Every track is fun and lively and hummable. I can't get Unforgiven out of my head! You can even hear Billie Joe's personality added into it (***smooch*** to Billie; love him!).Welcome BACK to La-La Land...it's been too long hidden.And Jane, you can be my singing telegram girl anyday."
5,Divine Goddesses,"God Bless the Go-Go's is a welcome addition the band's collection of recordings. The girls, er...women, have grown up and this album reflects the maturity. Tracks like ""Apology"", ""Daisy Chain"", and ""Insincere"" show a seriousness that the band only dabbled with in the past. Other songs like ""Unforgiven"", ""Stuck in my Car"", and ""Sonic Superslide"" represent the other end of the Go-Go's spectrum: rocking and having as much fun as possible while doing so. Overall, this is a stellar album with the silly lyrics, remarkable melodies, and ultra-catchy hooks that the pop-punk princesses are known for."
2,God Help the Go-Go's.,"Good Lord! What happened to this once terrific group? Their excellent, sweet voices and once powerful tunes are GONE. I don't know what went wrong here, but it did. Seriously. This is perhaps the biggest disappointment of all comebacks. Well, at least so far this year. The only bearable songs ""Daisy Chain,"" and ""Stuck In My Car,"" get lost in the dull, flat songs that make up the album. Half the time it either sounds as though they're dying right there in your CD player, or it's such poor singing, it's as though they've already gone to meet their maker. Perhaps that was where the got the idea for the title."
2,Nothing Special in this one.....,"As a teen of the 80's, I was thrilled to see that the Go-Go's were together again. The CD jacket is great! They sound absolutely identical to the way they did back then which was good to know as some artists totally change their style to their demise. As I clicked through tracks, I was eagerly awaiting to hear something grab me but unfortunately, it wasn't there. Nothing real danceable or singable...no smash hits that make you want to play it agin like ""Our Lips are Sealed"" or ""We Got the Beat"". I think I played through it twice. Better luck next time.I still love the Go-Gos but this was a disappiontment."
4,Returned from the abyss,"The Go-Go's have returned from the abyss that is the final resting place of a great many of the hitmakers of the 1980's. With their full and original lineup intact and a fresh snarl of attitude, God Bless the Go-Go's is classic 80's pop, souped up and kicked into overdrive. It is clearly the Go-Go's, with those endlessly catchy melodies and great harmonies and party-on beat, but everything has been cranked up a bit. The guitars have been set to ""11"", the drums hit just a little harder, and overall passion raised to the frenzy of a band who realize that this effort may just be their last chance to avoid a dwindling career of retro-festivals and VH1 ""Where Are They Now?"" appearances. If this comeback ultimately fails, it will not be for lack of effort or talent. This is a great album."
2,Why even come back??,"it's hard to believe it is 2001 especially after you listen to this album?The Go-Go's are still going for the Female Beach Boys Formula in Hopes of that Hit.i can still hear echos of ""We Got the beat"" here.it's the same basic formula that worked wonders for them in the 80's but someone needs to tell them that was cool then but a Good Retirement Party is a Must.take the Bangles back with you unless you are only gonna play Hits??the Arrangements&predictable Instrumentation is all here&it wasn't Missed by Me.it was cool in the 80's but unless Puffy or somebody else's Rips them Off they are best left back there to me.nothing has changed then or now."
2,Beat sans Beauty.,"The beat is still there, but the beauty typical of the Go-Go's music (melodies that stuck in your head that you just start humming them to yourself for no apparent reason) is just about nowhere to be heard.There's a reason why you can get this CD for the cost of shipping plus a penny. And, invoking the Deity with the religious artwork is just ironic, because it seems they were anything but blessed in the songwriting department as this blast of musical energy was being conceived. An extra star for the energy though! There are still worse things to listen to by far if you happen to be...er...stuck in your car."
3,So-So's,"Except for the exceptionally catchy ""Unforgiven"" most of the tracks are forgettable. ""Daisy Chain"" is okay, for example, but most of the songs seem repetitive (as others have pointed out). The proof is that even after several listens, it's difficult to remember a single melody other than the one in Unforgiven. - - I've listened to this disk several times more since writing initial review. I hate to admit that some of the songs are more memorable than I originally thought (e.g., ""Apology"") and still others are growing on me. My bad."
5,AN AMAZING ALBUM --- THEIR BEST EVER!,"What an absolutely great album this is! God Bless The Go-Go's is, without a doubt, the BEST the Go-Go's have ever done, and that's saying a lot considering how great their earlier stuff was. I like every single song on this CD, some just slightly more than others, but there is not one stinker in the bunch. The vocals on this CD are amazing. Belinda Carlisle's voice is superb, and the harmonies are smooth as silk. Jane Wiedlin also has a beautiful voice which makes the harmonies all the better.The guitar work is excellent, Charlotte Caffey really rocks on this CD. Gina Schock's drumming is superb. Kathy Valentine's bass playing on Kissing Asphalt is soooo cool, she just grinds that sucker! I honestly do not have a favorite song on this CD, they are ALL excellent. I love this CD so much, I may never play any other CD again! This CD deserves some industry awards .. it is THAT good!! BUY IT !!"
4,A really great cd,"This is a GREAT cd! The girls looks great and sound great. Belinda is still hot and what a fantastic distinctive voice, one of the greats really. Don't hesitate to buy this cd because it's really fantastic. Definately best comeback cd in a while. I wish it were more appreciated, because it's a great group of songs. I hope the Go-Go's stick around and make more records, because based on this, they are better than ever. Also get the Go-Go's VH1 Behind the Music Collection, also a great selection of songs. You will be hooked on the sound! God Bless the Go-Go's."
4,Great,Great tool. A little too fast paced for my 8 year old but I am using another practice book to cover some of the basics.
2,despite harsh portrayal shaw appears as artistic genius,"Having been a fan of Robert Shaw since seeing The Deep as a boy with my father and having read articles about him, I was rather dissapointed with the way his biography was written. It is often harsh and even demeaning at times. The authors appear to me to go out of their way to exploit the faults of the man, however one is still left with the impression he was an artistic genius. There was also very little time devoted to his experiences in Jaws and other movies which would probably be entertaining. The authors also spend a large portion of the book seemingly drawing their own opinions of Shaw. I am hoping to find another book on the subject."
5,FIve Stars,"I just got done reading a great book called Cave of the Painter's Mind by Joe Dennis. So, Matthew Warner's book, 'The Organ Donor', was the second act to follow. And, if the first act is great, usually the second act has a hard time surviving. However, this is not so with 'The Organ Donor'.From the beginning the story takes off like a rocket, with enough thrust to blaze to the end. Not only is Matthew Warner a good story-teller, but he's also a good writer. If you like Richard Matteson, who is famous for stories such as ""I am Legend', then you'll like 'The Organ Donor'. If you like horror books, then I recommend this book."
3,Book was never published,"I know the Authors, and Recommend the Barclay Institutional report published by Sol Waksman. I am an Active manged Futures Investor."
4,Informative but need some background to use effectively as a nature guide,"This book provides interesting background on Cape Cod, especially in terms of its geological formation and from a natural history perspective. The author, for example, provides a complete narrative of the likely geological formation of Cape Cod from the growth and recess of glaciers, the rise of moraines, and fresh water lakes. Also, she provides a very helpful background on the impact that settlers and subsequent generations had on the Cape's flora. I gave this book four stars, however, because I found it somewhat difficult to use as a nature guide for the new naturalist; some background in plant and animal identification would be helpful before using this as your primary guide. This book would be a nice companion to a guide that provides more information on plant/animal identification."
2,Not as direct fit as you would expect,"This was for an older car (84 BMW 633). We got it to fit, but it was not easy:1) Oxygen sensor bung is in the wrong place, causing sensor to rest on the block.2) Flanges where this bolts up to the back end of the exhaust were bent, and did not align well with the other piece. Had to bolt the heck out of it to get the flanges to mate.Save time, spend more and get the factory part. NOT worth the dollar savings in time you will spend getting this mounted."
2,Not good.,"This A & C movie was definetely not the best I have seen. It lacked the charm and comedy that the older one's had. The plot was leaky, the characters were cardboard, and the acting was not the best. Some parts were funny, but not hiarious. The plot was like: Jack goes up the beanstalk to go save the princess when she is taken by the giant. Of course Lou plays Jack and Bud plays the butcher. There is songs, the sets look fake and so do the props. The picture also is also not very good. if you want A good A & C movie try Hold that Ghost, Hit the Ice, meet frankenstein... These are much better!!"
2,Get Some Ear Plugs,"When the food processor is attached my machine makes so much noise I can barely stand it. The blender works fine, but the food processor is lousy."
1,looks great but won't go,"I finally opened and decided to use this Xmas present. It ran for about 10 seconds, then the motor seized up and stopped. I'm now in the process of trying to return it. Hold on to your sales slip !!"
1,A Dud,took it out of the box....tried the food processor only to be greeted by burning rubber smells and no processing or blending.Returned it and will look for something that works!
1,I'D GIVE IT LESS THAN ONE STAR IF I COULD!,"HORRIBLE!!!! I USED THIS BLENDER ONLY TWO TIMES, AND NO LONGER WORKS! JUST CHOPPING SOME ICE, THEN IT SMELLED LIKE BURNT RUBBER NOW IT DOESN'T WORK.UNFORTUNATELY, I BROKE OVER 30 DAYS SINCE I BOUGHT IT, SO NOW I CAN'T EVEN RETURN IT!!I'D HAVE BEEN BETTER OF PAYING A LITTLE MORE AT A REAL STORE FOR BETTER CUSTOMER SERVICE THAN BUYING ON-LINE.I WILL NEVER BUY ANYTHING THAT MIGHT BREAK (MECHANICAL) ON-LINE AGAIN!THANK FOR THE LESSON AMAZON!"
1,Very disappointing,"Purchased this product on 3/4/02. Right out of the box, the collar for the blender was cracked rendering the blender unusable. One call to H-B customer service and a new collar was received within 3 days. It is now exactly 5 weeks after it arrived. I have used the blender 3 times (I never did try the food-processor attachment) and the motor is burned out. I'm still waitng for H-B customer service to get back to me."
3,Spillz,"The glass blender doesn't have a lip to pour from,so it spills. Other than then its a good blender"
1,Blender is not blender but noise maker,"I really really want to have something both blender and foodprocessor. So I felt happy when I found this [inexpensive] product... But when I start blending ice , mango and apple to make a juice, that blender made very big noise and almost things are remained. I felt curious whether every blender works same... If I want to blend every thing, I have to open and push the foods on the top time to time... Good luck for everybudy~"
4,Not quite 1/2 price...but still a good deal.,This is a great blender/food processor and I would buy it again at this price. ...
4,Excellent Buy,"A blender and food processor for $... is the best deal anywhere. I used it to make salad when I first got it. It did fine with cucumbers but not with the lettue, tomatoes, or peppers. I have also made egg salad which turned out well. I only wish there were more attachments availible. There were other processors with many attachments but they cost much more than I was willing to spend."
4,A great combo,I love the fact that I can have two appliances - blender and food processor - combined into one. It saves a lot of space in the kitchen.
3,Off Damned Label!!!,"I haven't used it yet, but I agree with another reviewer. WHY, oh why, did they use what seems to be permanent adhesive on the label??? Arggh!!!!"
3,A good blender,"I've only used the blender to chop ice with, and it works just fine. Since I never cook, I've never used the food processor."
1,Gummed Up Label,"Why, oh, why did Hamilton Beach have to stick a gummy, crummy label on the very front of the white base that says, ""2 Appliances in 1"". Wasn't the labelling on the box enough? No! And in this day and age of easy-to-remove labels, why use this old fashioned label that is impossible to remove? Still can't get the gummy stuff off the base. My futile attempts have left the base marred. I'm really disappointed."
5,Very good quality at a reasonable price,"I gave a Hamilton Beach blender to a friend of mine as a gift last year. It's worked wonderfully, and that's pretty incredible, considering it's been used primarily for pulverizing ice for margaritas! I'm sure most blenders would have gone to small appliance heaven by now, but it just keeps on going. The glass blender jar is much nicer than plastic. Both probably work as well, but glass looks more permanent and makes for a nicer gift. I have a small food processor as well, and now I'm kicking myself, since it looks like they included it in this blender set at about half the price I paid for it. Good quality product, and remarkable value."
2,"Blender - Great!, Food Processor - A real loser!","I've just thrown out the food processor part of this appliance and replaced it with one that actually processes food! Often when you buy a tool or appliance that has more than one function you get a compromise that does neither task well. In this case, the blender works great, just as my old HB blender did for 20 years. However, whoever designed the food processor attachment didn't test it out enough in the kitchen. The ends of mixing blades are a good half inch from the sides of the bowl, when mixing or chopping anything but pure liquids, all the food gets moved to the sides of the bowl and out of the way of the blades. I had to continually stop it and scrape the food back into the center only to have it spin to the sides unchopped again - totally useless! Also shredding cheese nearly brings the slice/shred blade to a stop. Just not enough power there."
3,Good 2-in-1 appliance,"This combination appliance is just right for small kitchens with limited storage space. It saves the space and expense of a separate motor base. Would prefer a way to store the two included blades together inside the bowl. The food processor attachment is great -- very easy to attach, use, and clean. The small bowl size is fine for a couple or a small family. The blender is a blender and does what it should do. Limitations: it lacks the multiple cutting blades of larger food processors -- but I never used them all anyway. Switches are mechanical pushbuttons, not electronic. This appliance will suit most people well. Recommended."
1,disappointing glance at significant subject,"This book, by a religion editor who should have much to say, is an example of rambling impressionistic writing of the worst sort. A disappointing waste of time and money!"
3,Grayson triumphs,"""Love Finds Andy Hardy"" is usually considered the best film in the Hardy Family series, but ""Andy Hardy's Private Secretary"" might come in a close second primarily because of Kathryn Grayson's strong performance in this, her first film outing at age 19. Grayson was touted as MGM's answer to Deanna Durbin at Universal, and this especially shows in her florid coloratura soprano voice that one finds lighter and freer than Durbin's with an astonishing ease of movement up and down scales. Grayson's acting is unusually good as well.The film is typical Hardy fare with Andy getting into more than he bargained for trying to prepare a Greek tragedy piece for his graduation, not to mention flunking his required English exam thus threatening his own graduation. But as always everything turns out well in the end for Andy et al. This was the tenth entry in the Andy Hardy series and well worth viewing."
3,French cult classic.,"While vacationing in Auvergne, pretty French girls Francoise and Anna stumble upon a mysterious castle inhabited by the beautiful Morgana Le Fay (of King Arthur mythology). She, along with her creepy dwarf, Gurth, soon become obsessed with Francoise and Anna. Morgana requires the souls of females to continue her immortal life, and now Morgana'a got her eyes on them."
1,Do Not Buy! This is the 2004 Edition,I own this book and it is actually a 5 star book. However this edition was published in January 2004. The information is old. Buy the 2005 version to get the current information. Wishing all of you the best of good buys.
4,A Wonderful Introduction to Wine,"I choose to disagree with those who say that this book is not for novices. Domine turns wine from an enjoyable beverage into a complex puzzle that can be solved with knowledge and experience. His article on tasting wine, rather than a dryly-written procedural manual, invites the reader to share in the solving of a mystery with every new bottle. Domine obviously loves wine and writes on the subject in a way that allows the reader to understand the reasons for that love and to join in the affair.The book is obviously Euro-centric, but the knowledge to be gained through this book is immense. If you spend serious time with this book you will be transformed."
1,Okay...,"Well, this book was highly disapointing. I am aHUGE Phantom Phan and I absolutely love Erik, lol- but this book had a terrible portrayal of Erik.I hated how they described Erik. Erik was describedas more evil and selfish rather than loving towardsChristine. He lusted after Christine, rather then loved her. This is definitely not Gaston Leroux's version!I have many Phantom books - this one, I have to say, is myleast favorite!"
4,KING UMILIANI IS BACK!!,"The italian music composer pieri umiliani drops his electronicbomb!You wanna listen to it !This is an electronic masterpiece from king Piero!He was an italian talentous music composer. In 60s and 70she made wonderful music from italian muvies.His most know film score theme(AND THE MOST BEAUTIFUL,inmy opinion)was SVEZIA,INFERNO E PARADISO.Then,this cd is an alternative experimental project made by PIEROin late 70s. This Right Tempo reissue is good and have a good sound.Buy it if you want hear an extraordinary electronic masterpiece (see also Jean Jacques Perrey for similar items).But it if you like to know the music of Piero Umiliani,but first you must buy his film score themes as SVEZIA,INFERNO E PARADISO,or UNA BELLA GRINTA. Also,if you like jazz music you must buy the ITALIAN MOVIES with CHET BAKER."
3,"A feel-good book, but no real answers","If you want a book to validate your choice to breastfeed and use a family bed this is a good one. The author provides excellent information to share with your family and friends who may question your choices. However, if you are looking for ways to help your baby sleep better you won't find practical advice. For that read The No Cry Sleep Solution: Gentle Ways to Help Your Baby Sleep."
3,Only for family sleepers,"I bought this book looking for a way to get my daughter to sleep through the night. She was waking up four times a night at six months, and I was going in there each time. I was exhausted. This book just said that the baby needed me and I should continue to do so. Wrong! I would be dead by now. Instead, I got another book, Sleeping Through the Night by Jody Mindell. It was an easy read and it worked. I recommend that you get this one instead, unless you are just looking for a book that will tell you that it's okay to sleep in bed with your baby.My daughter was sleeping through the night by 8 months, thanks to the Mindell book."
1,duh!,"This book was SUCH a disappointment! I was looking for help with establishing sleep patterns for my 3-month old, and this book was not the answer. Suggestions such as ""don't give your child caffeine"" and ""don't play jarring music near bedtime""? Come on!"
5,A Very Helpful Book,"SWEET DREAMS is very helpful! I really like that it is filled with practical tips and easily understandable guidelines. We had been having problems getting our 2 year old to sleep. Dr. Fleiss's suggestions on positive bedtime rituals has already solved that problem. His words about the importance of parents involving themselves in their child's life really made me think. I suppose most parents think that they are involved, but SWEET DREAMS showed me what real involvement is. I am so grateful to Dr. Fleiss! I am giving this book to my best friend, who is expecting in a few weeks!"
3,Take with a grain of salt,"There is some good info in this book. However, despite the author's claims that all his advice is backed by scientific evidence, he still spouts his opinion freely and is obviously biased toward co-sleeping (note the strong adjectives - hardly scientific conclusions). He may be right, but co-sleeping is definitely not for everyone, so take his ""evidence"" with a grain of salt and do what's right for you."
2,Feel good book but no sleep answers,"If you are looking for a book that will make you feel better about Attachment Parenting (breastfeeding, co-sleeping, responding to your baby's every cry) this will provide lots of reassurance. If you are looking for ways to help your baby sleep, this doesn't have any answers. I'd look to The No Cry Sleep Solution: Gentle Ways to Help Your Baby Sleep Through the Night."
1,This book is not what I expected!,"Dr. Fleiss makes assumptions that are not at all grounded in scientific fact. In particular, he makes a connection that circumsized boys are poor sleepers (in an attempt to ask parents not to circumsize)based on a study that only showed that infant boys had more difficulty sleeping than girls. He also advocates co-sleeping without any good research to back his advice. I have a two year old with a history of sllep problems, and if I followed Dr. Fleiss' philosophies,I would be tearing my hair out now. He offers no methods to help your child sleep through the night!! I am astounded that others have found this at all helpful."
2,6 month review,"I've purchased the ivanko gripper 6 months ago. After reading reviews between ivanko and CoC grippers, I decided to go with Ivanko primarily because of the cost and number of different settings (approx 50).PROS- 50 settings for $36 + S/HCONS- large size requires one hand to stabilize while other is gripping- grip is slippery- size does not allow for easy travel or use in a car, etc.- package did NOT include any information on the settingsi called the 1 800 number on the paper in the package and the company rep did not have any infoi had to do a web search to find this on a grip board.After six months of use I sold this item and purchased the CoC grippers (trainer and size 1).Just received them and the quality is exceptional.Handles have a rough texture so there is absolutely no way of slippage.I personally do not recommend the ivanko and would recommend spending more money for the CoC grippers."
3,Dog brownie mix,"It was shipped on time. When I made it, I wish I had put smaller amounts of the batter into my dog bone pans. I have a Chihuahua and putting them into the dog bone pan and filling them half full made them way to big for my chi. In the future I will fill them just a quarter of the way instead of half full. Chrissy, my chi, loved them!"
3,Love It,All my granddaughters love this video. I was glad I found it @ Amazon. Not in stores. It made the road trip a little more bearable.
2,Borrring,I have four other Wiggles videos and this is by far the most boring video we own. It doesn't hold my 15 month olds attention at all. :(
1,FOR THOSE THAT HAVE INSOMNIA !,"Paid $10 to see a cast of unknowns talking in one line sentences about mostly NOTHING !! Boring,slowwwwww to the point of falling asleep.I saw the trailer to this and it looked more like a thriller.Save your $$$$ watch the trailer and you have seenthe Movie."
3,This movie was very persuasive,"This movie is very graphic and true. I like this movie alot, and recomend anyone to see it. This movie caught my eye soon as I saw the credits."
2,The Liberal Version,"Sam Waterston, one of my favorite actors, does a fine job. And the depiction of the hellish conditions of Kampuchea is excellent. But the movie is mistaken for blaming the U.S. for the destruction of that unlucky nation. The Khmer Rouge did that on their own, with the savagery of Mao's Cultural Revolution as their primary example. Saying that the U.S. was responsible for the actions of Pol Pot is like blaming the policeman for trying to stop the murderer."
3,"Tragic and touching, but long-winded","Although there are mostly 5-star reviews here, this is not the type of movie to have posters with less than stunning reviews (except the political posts). This movie is obviously well-made and well-received (7 oscar nominations and 3 wins), but I found it to be too long at 141 minutes and it did not really hold my interest.Director Roland Joffe said he interpreted the story as a love story and not a war movie, and indeed that seems to be the way he presents it. Playing John Lennon's ""Imagine"" at the end was a bit on the sentimental side, though.I've watched it 2 or 3 times and just had a hard time sticking with it. There is almost enough material to expand into 2 movies.DVD has a nice commentary, a short text-based blurb about actor Haing Ngor, a list of awards, cast/crew blurb, setup options and a trailer."
3,An otherwise-outstanding movie marred by left-wing bias,"The first time I watched KF, when I was in my late teens, it blew me away. I would have given it five stars then. But I've grown up in the interim. The last time I watched it, its many defects became apparent. The movie's foremost defect is its anti-Americanism, perfectly encapsulated in Sam Waterston's speech in which he blames the genocide on America (""I was not aware of what insanity American bombs could produce!""). Really, to accuse the U.S. of causing the Cambodian genocide is historically moronic, and only a nutjob whose intelligence is subordinated to his ideology could make such a claim.Shame, shame on the producers and writer for ruining what could have been one of the greatest movies ever."
3,DVD Jacket for The Killing Fields,While the DVD itself is an excellent film - the DVD Jacket is of extremely poor quality - not what I expected at all.It looks like a photocopy using very thin paper - not what one would purchase new from a store.A real disappointment
3,"Overall, the film was descent, although dry at some points.","The Killing Fields was overall descent. I personally liked the action scenes. I am honest when I say it got kind of dry during some portions. But, there was always another eye-catching moment that would get you back into the sway of things."
2,Confusing Message,"This was a very moving movie and I couldn't turn away. However, the political message was bizzare. Sydney rails against the USA for its efforts in Cambodia and the bombings. But the USA was trying to stop the Communist KR from taking power. The ensuing horrific blood-bath is the consequences of the Communist KR taking power. So naturally the outrage should be focused on the Communists. If anything, the USA could be criticized for withdrawing and NOT bombing the Communists more extensively. Then the movie ends with John Lennon's love-letter to communism, ""Imagine"" Very confusing political message indeed."
4,killing fields,movies was good however the quality of the film was not very good. screen was very cloudy at times and it was hard to see some things and the sound was not very good. the story it self was moving.---thks
3,Unfair to Al Rockoff,"This movie impugns Al Rockoff, the Photographer played by Malkovich.In the movie, Al takes Pran's photo for a fake passport to get him out and it fades and so Pran can't escape.It's not true - you can check on the Internet. The photo did not fade, and Pran left the compond for other reasons. Al did his job and this movie is not accurate."
1,Could not view,"I can not review this item since I could not view it. I found out that since the video was from London, England it was not compatible to be viewed in the US."
5,Moving,"After speaking with a Cambodian friend who went through this experience and hearing his stories, I felt compelled to watch this. It was very moving. It helps illustrate the extent of man's cruelty and depravity, uniquely human capabilities that are not at all humane."
5,Most memorable film,"This film had some of the most memorable scenes of any movie I have seen. Furthermore, I don't think the movie went overboard in its portrayal of America's role in the Cambodian tragedy. On the contrary, the Khmer Rouge got the lion's share of negative coverage."
3,Blame The US,"What amazed me about this movie was that the name of Pol Pot was never mentioned. The mastermind of the Cambodian genocide never gets the blame. Instead, it is all the fault of the U.S. bombing. It was all Nixon's fault. Sam Waterston's character is very unlikeable. He comes across as wooden and stiff; While (the late) Haing Ngor's character is touching, moving and believable. I recommend that one watch this film with an understanding that it is Hollywood's liberal attempt to place the blame on the U.S. rather than the source of the atrocities i.e., Pol Pot."
2,Poor quality DVD version,"Obviously this is a very powerful movie. Unfortunately, the DVD mastering is one of the worst I have ever seen. The VHS version is the only way you will be able to enjoy this movie. The sound of the DVD slowly fades between different levels of what I would call ""barely audible"". If you insist on buying this DVD be prepared to sit very close to the television with the volume turned up completely. You will still miss subtle dialog."
3,Historical but Brutal,"Although this was a historically accurate film, it was brutal and almost unbearable to watch. Just like the nature of Sydney Schanberg to expose the war to the America citizens through his papers, the film exposed the brutality with close ups of bloody guts and mutilated bodies. It was a very honest film which made sure the tragedy and slaughter of the Cambodian citizens was accurately portrayed. This was not for the faint of heart and made me extremely uncomfortable to watch the killings. I would recommend this film if you are comfortable with blood and want a true depiction of Cambodia in the 1970's."
4,An enjoyable documentary,"The reason why this movie is so moving is due to the actors and accounts of the people who lived through this horror. This movie shows a real-life relationship between a New York Times writer, and his assistant. Sidrey Schanburg is in Cambodia to report on the activates that are going on there. Dith Pran ( the assistant) and Schanburg's lives are placed in jeopardy as they fight to get the story for the New York Times. This movie is a great portal of a true life account of survival."
4,A war of disaster which created tremendous bloodshed.,"The Killing Fields, introduces the horror that the Cambodians experienced when Khmer Rouge troops invaded their government. Close-up reports on the war was written by an American, Sidney and his Cambodian side-kick Pran. The film contains real images of war, and horrible scenes of flesh rotten skeletons, blood and disgusting sights. This movie is very educational and interesting to watch, but not on a full stomach!"
4,Always get on the chopper!,"This movie could be considered an ""Epic"". It is very good, especially the last couple minutes when Pran finally reaches safety & then is visited by his old journalist friend.I took one star off because apparently the DVD version is not as long as the original. The original version showed a scene where the Vietnamese Army liberated the Khmer Rouge village right before Dith Pran makes his escape. This scene was missing & also some of the other scenes seemed shorter than they originally were. I would estimate that about 15 to 20 min. of film was chopped out of this version. I hate it when film studios do this. It's sacrilege!!!Hopefully a Directors Cut is released so I can again see the film in it's full form."
4,WELL DONE AND FACTUAL,"I was recently in Cambodia and visited the sites and museums (and the piles of skulls) of the killing fields. It always makes you aware of how thin the veneer of civilization really is when you consider Cambodians killing fellow Cambodians - according to the official count 1.7 million of their own people. The other reviewers thoroughly covered the plot of the movie and it was certainly deserving of three Academy Awards. This film will never be forgotten nor should it be. The film, and countless books, tell the story to the world about what the Cambodian people endured during the Khmer Rouge period. Shocking and definitely true-to-life drama."
3,As fun to watch as Schlinder's List,"The horror of Cambodia in the mid-to-late 1970's is all-too clearly depicted in this film about the fall of that nation to communism. It was the Nazi holocaust with an Asian face as witnessed by two reporters, one of whom escaped to tell his tale of what happened to those who were swallowed up in the so-called killing fields. Worth seeing, but not if you want to be entertained."
5,Memphis Rain -- Memphis Blues at Its Best!,"To those who have never heard Sandy Carroll LIVE on Beale Street in Memphis, this CD is one of the best alternatives! The tempo of each song flows into the next keeping even the slow dramatic tunes lively. From the opening number, ""Forecast Blues,"" there is a Down South funkiness that starts one's foot to instantly tapping. With funky songs like that and ""Blues Thang,"" to lighthearted whimsy like ""Too Many Hats"" and ""Honey Lovin' Gumbo,"" the entire CD soundtrack offers something for everyone. First time that I played this was like heaven. Sandy has a blues voice that truly stamps her as one of the most unique and memorable talents to come along -- this is especially evident with all of the ""copy cat"" sameness to most of American music these days. I must have played this CD to death the first 2 weeks that I had it. But, as much as I've played it, it draws me back like a good hot cup of Joe on a cold winter morning!"
4,Beautifully played,"I agree this album is wonderful, but does not hold a candle to the New York Philharmonic and Sharon Isbin..Rodrigo: Concierto de Aranjuez / Villa-Lobos: Guitar Concerto / Ponce: Concierto del sur. To compare go straight to Rodrigo's Adagio. Sharon's guitar playing and the Philharmonic are simply breathtaking and set that Adagio apart from any other verion ever."
3,buny-in-the-headlights,"remembered this film from years ago, fun to watch again. not as high-tech as modern movies but the makeup was pretty good for its' time"
2,C R E E P Y ! (but flawed),"Gargoyles was probably one of the creepiest movies of its era, and would probably be the best it could be except...the chase scene with the kids on motorcycles...watch the police car...it changes from Chevrolet to Ford then back again. When the film editor doesn't know the difference...that's when the mistakes occur."
2,"This is the perfect ""campy"" movie for a lazy Saturday eve.","Although the goofiness and horrible storyline of ""Gargoyles"" makes any thespian cringe in terror, the movie itself has spawned many a loyal watcher (at least, two that I know of -- my father and me -- but there are probably more...) I recommend this movie if you're an MST3K fan -- or if you're sick and tired of the ""Platoons"" and ""Titanics"" of this world. It'll take your mind off the seriousness of real life, if only for a couple of hours. Popcorn, cocoa, and laughter are required."
1,Hilarios B-Movie -- Fun for a Group,"We used to watch this movie in college, and make fun of it (especially the 15 minute dirtbike chase scene, that ends with a visibly purposeful wipe-out). That is the only way to watch it. So, if you want to see it, get a group together first, and just let the comments fly."
3,First movie I saw like this one.,"I remember seeing this when I was kid. Was the first movie I saw that was considered horror or scary movie. It was on late at night, after midnight show. Good ole show, poor effects, but good for the day."
4,I LOVE THIS MOVIE,I HAVE WATCHED THIS MOVIE DOZENS OF TIMES AND IT JUST GETS BETTER. BERNIE CASEY AS THE GARGOYLE HAS A VOICE THAT SENDS SHIVERS UP MY SPINE. WHEN DIANNA IS READING THE STORY OF THE INCUBUS IT MAKES YOU WANT TO BE A STUNT DOUBLE AND PLAY HER ROLE. BELIEVABLE? NOT A CHANCE! EXCELLENT? YOU BET!
5,I remember ths Movie!,I saw this movie when it was first released on TV. It was the most scary of it's time. By today's standards it's quite tame. It has lots of good makeup and special effcts. However from what I can recall of this creature feature was it was well written. It looked like a pilot for a series that never was. If you are a fan of 70's tv; it's a good bet you'll want this compelling drama for your collection. Apparently this was a TV movie that was replayed quite a bit on CBS late night TV. Before all the CSI reruns you see at night there was a movie right after the 11 o'clock news. I remember this one was played quite frequently.
5,great old classic,This has always been one of my favorite old classics and I might add difficult to find. I was so pleased when I found it on amazon. I'm a classic movie buff none of this nudity and vulgar language just good acting.The graphics were not bad at all for that time period.
4,Creepy movie,"I saw this movie when I was a child, it scared the hell out of me. I saw it again at the age of 30, it still did. Ok some of the costumes were cheesy, the special effects were limited and the acting pretty much stunk, but that creepy music.....oh man. I thought this movie was psychologically scary.This is a timeless B movie classic."
4,Terrifying B-Movie,"I, like so many others, saw this movie as a child in the 70's with my two sisters and friends of the family, at a sleepover. Our screams kept waking up our parents and none of us have ever forgetten this classic! I can't wait to receive it and relive some good times with my sisters, some popcorn and a late night!"
3,Early Stan Winston,"This movie used to be a staple on the UHF circuit and for good reasons. It's one of the first made-for-tv horror movies of the early 70's and it still stands up well almost thirty years later. Cornel Wilde makes the transition from the movie screen to the small screen without losing his presence. He is backed up by sexy Jennifer Salt who went on to star in SOAP and Scott Glen typecast as a biker. (Remember the biker movies he made with Gary Busey? Hex and The Shrieking.) The real star here is Stan Winston's costumes and there are many. Bernie Casey stands out underneath his makeup as the Garrgoyle leader. VCI has done an excellent job on the transfer, and all of these make this dvd an excellent purchase."
4,Memorable TV-movie from the 70's,"Not a bad excursion into mythology with anthropologist Cornel Wilde and daughter Jennifer Salt doing battle with legendary gargoyles in the American Southwest. Also on hand are ""Dark Shadows"" veteran and Oscar nominee Grayson Hall as a dotty proprietess of an inn and Berny Casey as the ""Head Gargoyle"" with a voice that is obviously dubbed by an unnamed actor.The film was one of my favorites while a college student and it still has a fond place in my memory."
5,It was one of them Gar things !,"My title is one of the lines from this great horror movie!I also watched this as a child during the 1970s in Tulsa on KTUL Channel 8 on the ""Plenty Scary Movie"" friday nights after the evening news.If you want a copy without breaking the bank,go to ""Kimsclassicmovies"" and get it for $12.00 !! She also has Killdozer and a lot of out of print movies!!"
1,way to much money for this product.,I would love to buy this dvd....but your price on this for a b monster flick is a little crazy. 50.00- 60.00 dollars? why? thats outrageous for this type of film. bring it down in price then you will have a buyer.
4,Still like Gargoyles,"I saw this when it was first released and never forgot it, so needless to say, I was glad when the DVD version showed up in my recommendations box. As an aside, I lived on the plains at the time this premiered. Just say'n, it's easy to let your imagination run wild after dark, especially if you live in a seemingly empty place where primitive fear can co-mingle with fantasy. I didn't find it as scary as the first time around, maybe because now I find the baby Gargoyles are more cute than frightening - but the Main Dude, yeah, he's really convincing as the Devil himself. The woman who plays the drunk'n motel owner is a show stealer and the make up artistry is great. All in all a four star gem of fun, funk, and chill factor. The DVD quality was also excellent on my 52 inch HD TV, so, if you like vintage horror by all means give Gargoyles a try - and be sure to lock your doors if the sun has gone down."
5,"tonight on the late show ""Gargoyles"" right after this message","Ah, this one is one of the better T.V. horror movies of the 70's and one more part of my attempt to find and watch all the old movies that I loved as a child. The chills that this one gave me then still creep back to me now.Cornel Wilde and Jennifer Salt are father and daughter investigating some strange bones found by an old man in Arizona. They turn out to be bones of the title creature and it's family wants them back, NOW!this one reeks with atmosphere and a sense of foreboding that it pulls you past any holes in the script and the Make-up by Stan Winston is great. this is one to watch if you Dare,in the dark. After all, its only a movie,right?"
4,Still Scares Me,"I saw this one back in the 70's when I was little, and several times since..It still scares the pajesus out of me."
4,Not quite worth the import price,"I bought the two songs (Greed for Your Love and Falling) from an online music site run by a company named after a certain fruit for just .99 each - since the other two songs on this 4 song EP are already on her excellent Sound of White album.The two songs that I did not already have are pretty good, but don't seem to match the songwriting and musical quality of those that DID make the album so great. If you're a fan, it would be worth seeking these songs out to get a few more songs from a rising star - however, I would highly recommend doing so at a lower price than is listed here."
5,Australia and it's musicians,"I came across Missy while being in australia, and she's definatley one of the best things to come out from down under in a long while. This melbourne based musician has earned her spars and is just starting to break out over seas.If you listen to the record, you'll realize that Missy is not only talented but soulful and deep. She has an understanding that not many 20 year olds have. She's incredibly talented and it comes out in the music she creates. I picked up her second ep ""Scar"" while still being in Oz, hopefully her full length album ""The sound of white"" will be released soon. Listen to the record, it's one that should not be missed."
3,Too general,"I've been reading and studying a number of different books on songwriting. I got ideas from reading this book, but there isn't enough ""meat"" to get me real excited. It doesn't take long to read it. If you really want to learn the art and craft of writing music or lyrics, this is a poor book."
4,Thumbs up.,"Joel Hirshhorn's book is brief but concise and to the point. It covers virtually every concept in songwriting along with some sound production advice. There are some areas that it does not cover in regards to alternate or extended tunings and more experimental musical styles, however, this is not really in the scope of the book. It is meant to be easily readable, which it is, and to cover the most important areas in traditional songwriting styles, which it does. Having read many other books on this topic I would like to see other areas added, such as the ones previously mentioned, along with some futher details on various voicings, and timbre/ sonic design. Overall, I give it a 4 out of five, as it covers everything it sets out to very well, for begginers to advanced readers it makes an important reference book or light reading material for the songwriters and composers library."
1,Even Idiots make mistakes... but they shouldn't.,"I found a glaring factual mistake in the book. I intend to contact the publisher directly to correct the wrong.If the authors let this mistake go out with the copyedited and fact-checked manuscript, how many other errors are within the pages? ..."
5,The Lord's Prayer in Daily Life,"I found this little book in an old trunk. Published in 1930 befor before the term ""politically correct"". It explains how the correct understanding and use of the Lord's Prayer answeres all prayers. A great little bookto give someone who is reaching out for help getting throgh a troubled time. Its like comfort food, makes you feel really good."
1,Doesn't toast & no double racks,"My last toaster oven had 2 racks. You could move the rack down if you have a larger item, say a frozen good. Well since I couldn't get my trader joes french onion soup in there on the rack and couldn't set it in there without the rack, I thought I had the best idea to turn my one rack upside down. It cooked the product, but not evenly. I just left the rack on that side and well it burns your toast this way on one side and not toast it on the other.It has a nice little ding feature when your toast is ready, but does not toast very well Well I have to agree that I checked the ratings by stars and not the reviews. Not a good thing here. Hopefully you will read this and purchase a different product.Save yourself the heart ache and buy a different toaster, but read all the reviews!"
1,Try another product,"I received this product a week ago. I bought it because of an excellent review I read here. But my experience is quite different. The heat is so uneven it can't get the job done. The toast test is a joke. Forget about cooking a frozen item properly. Maybe it's because the door is so crooked the heat is escaping. Or maybe it's because of some other defect. In any case, it's the most poorly made appliance of any kind I've seen in many years. Buy another toaster oven... even the cheapest one you can find will probably do better than this dud."
4,Excellent Toaster OR Oven !,"Fantasitic - I have had this toaster for 3 weeks now and not had any problems. I used to have just a standard bread toaster, but when I broke I went searching for something that could be used to heat pizza slices and other quick things from the night before. This oven does just that - for a great price. My only problem with it is its small interior size - just a little bigger would be nice."
3,not as advertised,"Received the oven today, and disappointed with the ""fit and finish."" Parts not fitting together correctly, and as far as the ""cool exterior"" while cooking, forget it. Seems to toast OK."
1,what a loser!,Bought it because of a great review read here - can't even toast both sides of a piece of toast. Wish I had saved the box so I could return it. Total waste of money.
1,Not what you think it is.,"It isn't a good value at all if you have good ears.These are re-recordings, not the originals that played on the radio. I happen to have an ear for this stuff and I knew right off it was a bit bogus. Fortunately for me, it was a friends CD so I didn't waste my own money on it. The friend never did know the difference, but I sure did.Don't buy this if you are looking for the original recordings."
5,Smooth - Talented - Impressive,"I don't buy a lot of jazz, but I saw Raul Midon on TV. He played just two songs and I was amazed. I bought this CD and I was impressed even more. I was impressed enough to buy this CD again and send it to a friend who does buy a lot of jazz. She was also impressed. She says this is good driving music. I say its good music to have playing all day in the background as you work. It'll put you in a good groove. It's now at the top of the list of our jazz playlists. I wish I could see the guy perform in person."
2,Difficult read,"This is the original journal and is written in the florid, stilted style of the times. The maps are minimal and it was difficult to tell where things were taking place. I would have preferred a good biography."
4,Oldies Fan,Brings back fond memories of broadway style music and the genius of composers of the pre and post WW2 era.
2,doesn't charge,"Simple as that. It didn't charge for me. You have to play around with the cord and keep it in place to get any kind of power from it. But the product was very inexpensive so you get what you pay for.These kinds of items are like playing crane games on the boardwalk .. they're cheap, and most of the time you lose, sometimes you win. I lost! But I'm sure other people have satisfactory experiences with this item."
2,Not happy transaction,I received the charger with a broken piece. Charges anyway but is not safe. I decided to buy another one
2,It takes a long time to charge the battery,I have bought this product since i was getting the product for just 99cents. but eventually when i started using the travel charger that I noticed that it doesnt work fine. it takes a lot of time charge the phone.
1,poorly made,"The charger is poorly made in it's connection to the Treo 700wx. The connection is not good because the design for the connection is weak and thus hard to make it connect. If you can jiggle the connection to even get it to work, it appears the charger is actually changing the phone. This item is cheap so I guess I got what I paid for but certainly not what was represented."
1,outraged!,The company delivered the wrong product. It took several e-mails to elicit a response. I was finally offered a refund if I would remove the negative review I had posted. This is outrageous! I will not remove an honest and accurate review to get a refund to wich I am entitled. Is this how Amazon companies keep up a positive profile? I want my money back and an apology!
1,Won't work with a TX,"I ordered this charger for our TX and found that the plug is too big to fit into the TX socket. Because of the extremely low cost of the charger, I did not attempt toreturn it. However when Eforcity found that it did not work for the TX they refundedthe cost to me without my asking. This is very rare in my experience and certainly speaks well for this companies integrity and concerns with customer satisfaction.I would certainly not hesitate to buy from them again."
3,It's does charge,"I ordered a couple of extra chargers for around my office and an extra for home. Neither one charges when plugged in. With both, the cord has to be bent to allow the phone to receive power from the charger."
1,Won't work with the TX,"The charger plug is too big for the Palm TX, so it is totally useless. I subsequently looked at previous reviews, and it appears thatin April 2011 someone wrote a review titled ""Won't work with TX"". I wish I had read that review before I ordered it. I also wish eForCity would stop listing it as a charger for the Palm TX when it obviously is not compatible with the TX. Very frustrating."
5,Excellent for cardio workouts,"Probably my favorite feature of this game, which I haven't seen addressed in most of the reviews, is that you can set it to Fitness mode and go on for long intervals non-stop (well, except for a few seconds pause between songs, which is useful for catching your breath and/or re-hydrating). If your goal is time (or you can choose calories), you can go up to 60 minutes, so it's a fun way to get a good, sustained cardio workout. Particularly in the challenging levels, the time can go by pretty quickly, and you end up having burned some serious calories. I have yet to figure out how to do this in DDR, if it's even possible. And as many have mentioned, it's kind of refreshing to play along to songs that aren't commonly-known; many are pretty catchy and fun to listen to."
4,"Good Book, but...","The book is good to see lots of pictures of steam plant equipment and a bit is given explaining what the equipment does, but I found the ""Steam & Diesel Power Plant Operators Examinations"" book much more powerful to pass fireman and engineers exams, including employment interviews! I suggest to buy both of these great books!"
3,"Not what I expected, but ok","Based on the editorial review, I thought this book would have questions or prompts designed to bring to mind memories, thoughts, and feelings about a friend, which I could then write about in a space provided. I thought that was how I would be able to ""personalize"" it. In truth, the only way you can personalize this book is to tape a photo on the first page, which then shows through a window cut into the cover. The book is ok if you're looking for a cute little gift book of quotes on friendship. Still, there are some pages (labeled ""Survival Tip"" and ""Did You Know?"") which detract from the book and should have just been left out. I did appreciate the clear Christian perspective of this book, though."
3,Interesting idea,"Nice idea, but I did expect a bit more.I expected a more authentic trip - this tended to be more commercial type trip, just lumped in one year instead of few weeks each year.They stayed in Australia for 6 months, so I thought there we will get the impressions how living there feels like, how their culture is different. No such luck - there is basically nothing about it at all. Anyway, it is a fun read, so check it out from the library."
3,one year off....,"A very interesting and entertaining book. It is not a ""how to"" book though so if that is what you are looking for then pass this one up. There are a few good ideas that he passes on the reader but it is definitely NOT a instructional book. There is some diatrabe about this patron's country that are NOT entertaining. These statements are really sad but everyone is entitled to their opinion. Since I am entitled to mine, I have to say this book is only a 3 star."
3,A Brilliant Teacher,"If you liked this book, you will probably enjoy ""A Brilliant Teacher"" about a family that had a similar year-long world adventure, but with very different experiences because they were on a limited budget. The family in ""One Year Off"" seemed to have unlimited resources. The limitations in ""A Brilliant Teacher"" lead that family to meet lots of interesting people and have quite interesting adventures with their three children.A Brilliant Teacher: Lessons Learned from One Family's Journey Around the World"
5,Fantastically Inspiring,"Having bought this book i simply could not put it down. I admire anybody who can sell their house and car to travel somewhere new, taking the bull by the horns and knowing they need to take a risk to experience life. I know, i've done it! However, this was a risk and a half. I read the book living the adventure through David Cohen and his family and didn't want it to end. I am truly inspired and saving for a journey of my own (though i am not sure i am quite brave enough to do what he did)."
2,Not worth it,"I bought this set 2 years ago when I bought a new home. Within a year, it got little bubbles in the non-stick coating. Now I'm going to have to throw them out and start over because patches of the coating are gone leaving disgusting little brown patches and peeling bits are getting in our food! And I never use metal in them, all I have are wooden spoon sets and nylon spatulas. I'll never buy Farber again. This time, I'll spend the money on a Circulon or Calphon and get something that will REALLY last."
4,But It At Costco and Save $$$$,"I really like this set. I guess it is a ok deal for [the price]. I was shopping this week-end at Costco and saw the 14 piece Millenium set for [lower price]. GEEZE!! I hate that. Now you know, if you live by a [local retailer] get it there."
3,Rough Riders cleanup Range,"Rough riders,Tim McKoy,Buck Jones and Raymond Hatton go undercover to rid valley of rustlers and murderers led by a vicious and divious lawyer. Dave O Brien co-stars."
4,Christmas in Vienna,I heard one of the pieces on Sirius Radio and bought the CD based on that. Nice that it came so promptly.
5,The Kookaburra and Other Stories,"Laughs, chills and thrills for Children of all ages. Tia - Gam The Trickster delights with a sense of humor and mischief! Whales Canoe will take you on a trip that must be explored by young and old. This CD is a must have for entertainment.... cruising down the road, sitting around the campfire or just playing pretend!"
3,OK workout for a lighter day,"Just did this workout for the first time. It was ok. The moves fast moving so you can only use extremely light weight. I can normally go heavier with bi's and tri's but then need to lighten up for shoulders. Since this is a routine being built up through blocks and finale at the end putting it all together, you can't switch weights. This is more of a light weight circuit training workout. I get more of a workout with Jackie Warner or Kelly Coffey Meyer and of course Cathe Friedrich. Haven't decided if this one is a keeper yet. I didn't work up a sweat and my heart rate did not elevate. When I do a 30 minute workout I want it to be a bit more intense. I dunno, maybe it's just me. Seems like others have enjoyed it. Probably depends on your level of experience. I enjoy weight lifting and circuit workouts, this one just seems wimpy."
1,"BEWARE, not Robert Nighthawk and.....",...nobody on the cover looks like he could be RN II either. Disgraceful.
4,"The Later, but not Greater, Planet Earth","I saw the film in 1979, and it had a tremendous impact on me. Hal Lindsey, while obviously further removed from the last days than we are now, did a tremendous job of paralleling the prophecies of the Bible with the current events of the late 20th Century. While the pace drags a bit here and there, and some of his speculations on possible fulfillments of Scripture obviously did not happen (the ""Jupiter Effect""), the LGPE is still a good documentary on how the Second Coming of Christ, for the first time in history, has the potential to come to pass in our lifetime."
4,The Revelation of Jesus Christ revealed,"Although this movie is a bit dated the subject makes it a must have for any Christian home. Many of the issues discussed are visible today due to the time that has passed since this films fist screening.This is a subject matter, in my opinion, that should be researched further by Christians in the way of sound intruction from reputable seminarians. There are some that tend to deminish the message. But this movie tells what world events are of importance and of the things to come in dramatic documentary style.JRG"
2,Outdated application of prophesy,"I first saw this video around 1979 and was impressed with it. Seeing it now in 2008 and being able to look ""back"" at some of the dated predictions made at the time of this films production made me shake my head. Too many liberties were taken by the writer(s) in terms of setting dates for the fulfillment of some of these prophesies. The production value is poor and the long drawn out filler scenes, such as the one at the beginning where a false prophet is chased down on foot for what seems an eternity, are boring and detract from the message of the film. The DVD ""The End Times"" is far better in every way. I'm sorry that I purchased this one. I was going to use it as a teaching tool but my students lost interest very quickly. I wasted my money. Save yours..."
2,Late Great Planet Earth Showing Its Age,"The ""Late Great Planet Earth"", based on Hal Lindsey's book of the same name, was released in 1976. Watching this movie shows how much the world has changed in 23 years. It also shows how heavily current culture and society flavor intrepretations of biblical prophecy.Some parts of the film are forward looking (cloning is mentioned long before there was a ""Dolly"".) Computers are identified as a way to control the masses--and that may yet come to pass. However the film doesn't see the Internet and the personal computer revolution.The cold war, Russia and the fuel shortage of the early 70's figure heavily into the film's predictions of the immediate onslaught of the seven-year tribulation period. (Which the film boldly states will begin in 1982.) Opps!As a period piece, this film is interesting. It also gives pause to think about prophecies yet to come to pass, but watching it is like getting into a time machine."
2,Outdated,"I bought this DVD hoping that would have events that would be closer to our times, since the description did not say the year of production, I just based my decision on the summary in the back of the case. For a moment I thought I was watching the old ""Thief In The Night"" series. I wish the production would have been more updated to what we are living now on Earth. I wish Hal Lindsey would make a new one for our time."
3,Do not let kids see it.,"I don't even remember what this movie is about, but it scared the living hell out of me when I was about 5 years old. Keep out of reach of small children."
1,Not what I expected,"Thought this would be a good video dramatizing Bible prophecy, especially since Orson Welles appears prominently in it & Hal Lindsey's book was on the best seller list for a long time. I was disappointed. Unfortunately this is a very boring video. It drags on way too long & its subject matter is dealt with in a drab, uninteresting way."
3,Where's the other one?,"STG, (swear to god, BTW) I thought this was the Orson Wells 1970's docudrama which showed the JFK assassination that played forward and reverse over-and-over, not only highlighting the president's brain exiting his brain-pan (and Jackie chasing THOSE brains, not trying to help some Secret Service guy on the rear bumper, BTW!), but, also, zooming in on the base of the green highway sign (just before the underpass, on the right hand side of the road), hiding behind one of the its square posts, revealing the true assassin of JKF (in safari hat, with rifle, in the bush on the side of the road!) Or did I dream it?"
1,the kingdom is not about fear. this is far from bible accuracy.,"over the years this has been ignorantly used as a tool of evil. there, i said it.and YES, i am a christian.fear is not a tool that should ever be used to love folks into the kingdom.go back to our roots and you will find that the rapture is only an idea less than 200 years old and not bibically accurate."
4,"If you like or love scary tales, then read this book!","The book that I read intitled Real Life Strange Encounters was a fantastic book.If you like scary old folktales then you will just love this book. You can see from the cover that this book is going to be a nice and interesting book because there is a gigantic octopus on the cover.The book is not just one story, there is a combination of 12 terrifyingly twisted tales that will tickle your tummy. I liked maybe 9 or 10 of the 12 stories. If you read the book, a story that you should look out for is Spring Heeled Jack. It was about an insane creature who hopped around killing women. It is the best story in my oppinion in the whole book. If you have thought about buying this book, or borrowing it from the library, do so. That is my oppinion on the book."
1,One of the greatest disappointments ever committed to print.,"I purchased this book in the hope of finding details of some former British ferries which were later used on the pilgrim trade throughout the Red Sea. Sadly, I found a confusion of detail and poor organisation in a book lacking in so many areas it soon became one of the few I have ever thrown away.It is not just that the ships I was researching were not here, it's that I had to search the rather lengthy captions which accompany each and every photograph before I found the name of the ship in the photo! Nowhere is there a list of illustrations or a bibliography and the Appendices are so disjointed as to make them superfluous.Altogether one of the greatest disappointments ever committed to print.NMNB; This review is for the 1985 version of this book and not the more recent edition. My review has, however, appeared against both!!!"
1,HORRIBLE!,Did not last long!!! If you are looking for a good quality vibrator don't waste your money on these cheap pieces of junk... Pay the money for a Lelo product they are worth every penny!!!!
5,So pretty!,"I ordered this kit for a friend's wedding. It had plenty of thread and fabric, and the key is a nice touch. It will need spacers when framing due to the space for the key, but it will make a nice gift for the newlyweds."
5,Big picture - Small price,I have had the CT1810 for over a year. I paid $670 for it then. I was curious as to how much they are going for these days by searching the web... I was impressed to see that Amazon's price was so competetive.This LCD is an excellent product for the $$$!
4,"As good as ever, but a bit more on the heavy side","It is a good DVD set. The absense of Christine McVie is compensated by more energetic performance of the rest of the band, presenting the material with more ""rockier"" approach.Lindsey guitar playing is just amazing - outstanding performance! John's bass as solid as ever, while Mick's drumming is pure fun - especially his solo with ""drum vest"". Stevie Nicks is in good form and her voice is still clear and powerful. Four original members of this line-up (there was Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac, remember?) are backed up by several good background musicians and for almost three hours present old classics and some songs from their new album ""Say You Will"".Though I already have their ""Dance"" DVD (which is great, BTW), this concert is also definitely worth watching. More than this, it's a must-have for any Mac fan (and for any lover of good rock also!). Don't hesitate - go and get it!"
4,Very Good - With a Few Surprises,"I saw Fleetwood Mac on the ""Say You Will"" tour in Oklahoma City and Toronto and was amazed how the different the two shows were. The OKC show suffered from horrible acoustics and technical glitches - neither was the band's fault but the Toronto show was first-class. Happily, the Boston show on this DVD is seamless and glitch-free. There are several surprises: Stevie Nicks' ""Beautiful Child"" is wonderfully emotional and beautifully sung, ""Rhiannon"" and ""Gypsy"" both fare better than on ""The Dance"" but ""Silver Springs"" is'nt performed as well - perhaps because it is familiar now and it was'nt back in 1997. Lindsey Buckingham's fiery guitar and quirky vocals are one of a kind and he is in fine form here. But Christine McVie's presence is sorely missed: her upbeat, bouncy love songs always countered the darker material from Nicks and Buckingham and her backing vocals helped propel the performances from all the voalists. The accompanying CD is a nice bonus"
3,A cold performance from my favorite band,"First of all let me say I am a HUGE FM and Stevie Nicks fan. I have seen them numerous times in concert and I own anything that was ever released on vinyl, CD, and DVD. I bought this DVD a while back but decided to submit a review now after watching it again last night. The problem I have with it is not only the editing that others have mentioned, but the lack of 2 happy faces (Stevie and Lindsey) on stage. They know they are being filmed for a big concert release package that will be purchased by many of their fans, yet the performances are so lackluster. Very few smiles, low enthusiasm, and hardly any audience give and take. Maybe they weren't crazy about being filmed in the first place or it was just a bad night...whatever the case may be, I think they could have given more energy and passion as in the Dance. And yes, I do miss Christine McVie's presence."
3,"A little tired, a little too little.","Fleetwood Mac certainly had their place in the 70s and even into the early 80s, until their undoing, by their own hand. I loved ""The Dance"" as a marvelous comeback tour for a once great band, but ""Live in Boston"" without - Christine, just didn't quite drive the point home as to why they are still out there doing it all over again. Lindsay has an inspiring solo where he simply throws and slaps his guitar around, but he tries it several more times throughout the concert, and it just isn't the same, in fact, its tiring and a bit too despirate of an attempt at getting the crowd excited. Mick has his moments at the front of the stage with a percussionized vest, but what was the point on this long, drawn out ""solo""? Save your money and watch ""the Dance"" instead."
5,Lindsey Buckingham - Creative Genius,"When I viewed this DVD, I was in tears due to the fact that I had not witnessed such a fabulous concert in so many years. Frankly, I was shocked at the greatness that was exhibited in an era when music is only about looks and the money.dditionally, Fleetwood Mac is not nor ever has been my favorite band.However, after viewing Lindsey Buckingham live I was floored. The guy is the closest thing to Jimi Henrix I have ever heard. Obviously, we all know he is grossly underrated.I would advise anyone who loves music to watch this and see a real player in action. You will not be disappointed. His humility in today's society is a rarity which makes him even more awesome.God bless all. The Music Goddess."
3,"Very Good, but not best","I thought this was a very good show. As noted below, there is a lot of studio fixing on this DVD, which is a little strange, considering that the Dance proves these guys can deliver live. If you don't have the Dance DVD or CD get them first. Christine McVie is sorely missed on this."
4,Plenty of energy,"One nitwit wrote that there was no energy. What? What planet were you on? I saw them early in their tour in San Diego, and I was blown away by the power and emotion. Lindsey was a wildman he had so much energy!"
2,DVD Audio - NOT DTS Surround!,"Caution - unless you are a serious music-phile, this is average quality picture and average sound quality. Most newer concerts are recorded in DTS Surround Sound (ditigal theater surround). It could have been much better. The show is fairly good, but Lindsay Buckingham is the frontliner here and he knows it."
1,be aware is 4:3 with black spaces up and down,"only want to say that the picture is very poor: is a video 16:9 but in 4:3 WITH BLACK SPACES UP AND DOWN ON THE SCREEN, if you want eliminate that you have to use the zoom and lose quality, ¿Why not a real 16:9 edition?, I do not understand, really a shame"
5,A Great Concert DVD,"I just got this DVD 2 days ago and have already listenend to it twice. In one word it is ""awesome"". I have a high end audio system and I was very pleased with the sound on the 5.1 surround sound. The picture quality is also very good and cmaera angles are great. This is what a concert DVD should sound and look like. Sound Stage has done a good job of mixing. I would put it up there with my best DVDs. At some points the voices are a little low but I can live with that. Stevie's voice is great after all these years. Lindsey, John and Mick are equally good. Great band, Great songs, Great DVD. A must for FM fans."
2,Lindsey Goes His Own Way,"Just listened to Lindsey's ""Go Your Own Way"" from Live in Boston--a shadow performance, singing at a low register and sounding like he's passing a kidney stone. Yikes! Of course, being older makes it hard (impossible?) to hit the screaming high notes, and trying to preserve his voice for the rigorous road tour, he's just not going to meet the high expectations of his fans who remember his incredible talent."
3,Stevie Nicks Makes This DVD Worth It !!!,"I've been a Mac fan since the 70's and have seen them many times over the years. I just seen this for the first time today and was a little disappointed. The fun, friendly tone of The Dance DVD was missing. Stevie Nicks is fantastic on every song, but doesn't look too happy. Although Lindsey Buckingham is an excellent guitarist, his forced vocals and ridiculous actions made me really miss Christine McVie's set even more. This group seems to be going through the motions. I'm glad I spent $20 on this DVD and not $120 for a concert ticket."
3,ok,"Fleetwood Mac is one of my favorite bands, I proposed once while we watch Stevie singing Silver Springs. That said, their DVD the dance is memorable to me. However, her performance was poor in this concert. Her vocals had no passion behind it. I was disappointed when I watched this. It has all their great songs but the performance was laxed."
4,great concert,"This was a great concert dvd, although not quite as good as ""The Dance."" The best part was that it included songs that are not heard as often as the more popular songs."
4,NOW THIS IS MORE LIKE IT,"I have a big problem with Fleetwood Mac. For all their brilliance, they can't seem to get it right. I can't say if it was because of all the infighting, or all the drugs, but they seem to be always one step away from being completely great. I'm sure all know the story about the Tusk album costing $1 million dollars in production costs, resulting a $19.99 retail price upon release. (I guess it's the record buyer who has to pay for all the drugs.) And even when they performed live, Fleetwood Mac seemed to never get it right. Too remote. Too aloof. Too weird. However, with this release, the band shows what they can really do. Accomplished musicianship, not to mention an solid rapport with their audience, makes this performance a keeper. And Lindsay Buckingham must be the most underrated guitarist of all time. He can outplay anyone!"
5,Won't Watch Doctor Who Without It!!!,"Since receiving this book, I can't watch a Doctor Who episode without it. I don't know how the authors could analyze and link all the episodes together, but they did. I love to read the fluffs and goofs sections before watching an episode to spot the same bloopers. The book has a rather curious habit of taking any line with ""end"" or ""take it"" or other such language and turning it into something sexual. This may be a result of watching too many episodes and trying to insert humor into a book that has more of a reference quality. My copy is well worn and I also use it to see which episodes I am missing when searching to buy videos. If you don't have this book- get it!!!"
3,Take the bad with the good,"It's difficult to ascertain what to make of this book. The factual references are terrific, goofs, blunders, dialogue triumphs and disasters, and the double entendres are hysterical. The problem I have with this book arise when the authors try to explain the inconsistencies that plague the show, filling in the continuity blanks. This is reminiscent of geeks trying to decide who'd win in a fight between Superman and Batman. Who cares! Does everything have to be explained. Here's an idea: Take each story as a separate entity without trying to link something that the writers obviously did not deem worthy to be linked, unless that link is implied in the story. You're enjoyment of the show will drastically increase. In other words, if it ain't there, don't look for it. Their explanations bewilder more often than not, and leave the reader more confused than before."
4,Good entertainment value,"This collection, aside from the first two recordings of Welles and Rathbone, assembles the radio series of Sherlock Holmes as it was after 1945. The sequence of actors portraying Holmes is Tom Conway ('46-'47, 14 recs), John Stanley ('47-'48, 11 recs), John Gielgud ('55, 9 recs) and Carleton Hobbs ('60s, 3 recs). This comes to 20 hours of plays on 20 CDs. The power of radio plays is less in Kilowatts than it the ability of its performers to pull you inside the story by the force of their voice alone. For those who are used to a fuller presentation on film, this is a unique opportunity to judge these players from a single dimension, their vocal tones and inflexions. I thought Gielgud did the best job, although Tom Conway was a close second. I guess theatrical background is a big help to reaching this kind of a talent. As the booklet mentions, Tom Conway's voice and Rathbone's were very close. See if you can tell the difference."
1,Sweat up a storm,"I bought this for driving in a convertible, top down, because I liked the light weight, rigid brim with rocker shielding front and back. Moving in an open car it's fine. Otherwise one sweats like a pig. Tilley refused to take it back saying I should take it to the shop where I'd purchased it but the shop had gone out of business. I put in extra grommets but to no avail. It's no wonder that Tilley now makes many different mesh versions. There are many better hats available from other manufacturers w/o the added cost for the ""hype""."
2,Not very durable,"This is my second parking mat. Since the first one fell apart, I purchased a more expensive, heavier duty mat this time. Unfortunately, the edges keep falling off in the rear where I drive over it. Also, I live on a dirt road, so it get very dirty and is a pain to clean."
5,"good product, overpriced shipping","product works good, ordered 11 packages to share with a friend and got a shock when I saw the shipping price. $52.69 for the filters, okay, I can handle that. The shipping price is another story. $49.39 for shipping and these things are not big or heavy. Five coffee filters in a package isn't big, eleven packages doesn't add up to much space or weight at all. So where do they get almost $50 for shipping? I'm not happy with the shipping price. That company will never get another penny out of me. Amazon, do you read these?"
2,"Dull, dry academic pianism","The Second Piano Concerto of Glazunov could have and should have been done better. The tempi were entirely too slow and the eighth notes in the piano sounded like pin-pricks, devoid of any emotion."
5,Excellent toy!,My six month old loves these bells. He often plays with them. They are very durable and not too loud.
5,"Fun product, fast delivery","My children like jingling the bells while singing, they have so much fun. It's a little big for toddlers/preschoolers but i dont mind. i like it better that they hold it and easily control loud, soft, long, short sounds.The seller is superb, they're offering free shipping and I got the package a day earlier than expected. No hassles."
4,non adjustable,"These seem sturdy, and make a great sound. My biggest issue is that the straps aren't adjustable. still like, but adjustable would make them perfect."
3,Great for Holiday Cheer,"Although it arrived promptly and has a great sound, I was also disappointed that it is riveted closed and not as described. It's made for such a tiny wrist and not for an adult to wear. Otherwise, you can't beat the price! I would have loved it to have a Velcro closure instead so I could wear it."
2,Love the toy don't love the shipping charge!,"I begrudgingly bought this set of bells as my daughter loves to play with them and I couldn't find a set anywhere else. I love the price of them but, I don't love the shipping charge which doubled the cost. Imagine how annoyed I was when I then saw exactly the same (in fact better as these are not velcro adjustable and are fixed to one size that is too big for my child and too small for me) in Hobby Lobby for $1.99!! Oh well. Live and learn."
2,Just OK,"Bells sound fine but strap is not adjustable. We kept and use a little bit with our 2 year old daughter, but not easy to use... Can really just hold the bells."
3,Not bad,"Great for the price but this doesn't actually fit on the average wrist. I'm not even sure that it could slip on the average kid's wrist, but I could be wrong."
5,My son fell in love with this,"My little fellow loves Jingle Bells. He got into our decorations last year around June just to sing Jingle Bells. I was upset because he ruined the decorations, but it gave me a brilliant Yule idea. We bought these for him, along with some other musical instruments. He LOVED these. He wouldn't stop ringing them until the past few days...like 2 weeks of bells ringing. The look of pure joy upon his face. He didn't even throw these, unlike most of his toys. He put it away nicely.It also works as a homing device for your kid. Just give the little stinker the bells and you will always know what they are into. AT least that's what it ended up being useful to me for."
5,Fun,"A group of preschoolers use these during music time once a week, they are fun and pleasant sounding. There has been no fraying along the edges after several months use, I know when that happens they become scratchy. We have not had this problem."
4,Very festive,"My niece has become obsessed with ""Jingle Bells"" over the past few months, so I got her a few of these to wear on her arms or ankles as she runs around. They sound great and are a great value. I may order more to hang on my doorknob!"
2,velcroLess Bell,The bells are well made and make lots of noise... BUT THEY DO NOT HAVE ADJUSTABLE VELCRO CLOSURE AS THE DESCRIPTION SAYS!!!! which makes them unwearable for adults and they easilly fall off kids hands! They can't be attached to a belt loop or handheld or ankle! very disappointing.
1,Sent back!,"We bought with the expectations of wearing these for an office Christmas party. We also thought they were velcro, they are not, so they didn't fit."
5,Great for hanging on a door knob.,"I like the sound of bells when coming in or leaving the house. I hang these in the inner door knob of my front door and I can hear when someone comes in as well. For this purpose I'd like the strap to be a bit thinner but really, they make a nice cheery sound and are great."
3,addition to my collection,"This cd is good, but not among my favorites/makes a good addition to my music collection.If you like the Spin Doctors it's worth owning."
3,Somewhere between dead and just comatose in the water,"A group of unhappy people go on a budget cruise on a rundown freighter. An accident while they are overtaken by a fog bank causes them to have to abandon ship, whereupon they discover the nightmare has just begun.The book had a couple of creepy moments, but mostly it just annoyed me. I can't really even put my finger on why, other than the fact that I found it to be rather cliched and predictable. It didn't outright insult my intelligence, but it did talk down to me a few times. It wasn't a bad read, but I can't honestly recommend it either."
2,Alas . . .,"Okay, I wanted to like this novel . . . I really did. I managed to get through 120 pages, and at that point I read the professional reviews for it and found out that everyone drowns in the end - I got to the point where the ""sea monster"" had more or less attacked it's first victims mind, and I said ""Enough, already!""I liked Donna and wanted to hang with it until I found out what happened to her, but I just couldn't. I'm not into sea monsters, sorry. And if everyone drowns, why bother . . . someone should be able to escape . . ."
1,Horrible,"Written in 1994 and the winner of the Bram Stoker Award, it is significant that this book has had only 2 reviews, both with 5 stars. Nobody else bothers to waste their time reading it. I love a good horror novel, but this beats anything I have ever plowed my way through. The pickings must have been slim, indeed, for it to have won the award. Someone, (if anyone in the world bothers to click onto this one) please tell me how the Bram Stoker awards are chosen. I am not stupid and I have a rather good imagination but throughout the majority of this thing, I could not tell what was real and what wasn't. Maybe the author would email me and tell me. HaHa."
4,MISS SPIDER REVIEW,I bought this for my granddaughter and she liked it very much even though I did not watch it with her.
3,"Great musician, great vocalist, mediocre lyrics","I agree that Deborah Coleman should be getting more recognition than she has. She's a wonderful musician with a distinctive voice. And the arrangements on this album are quite good. For that, she gets five stars.But when it comes to original lyrics, she has a major deficit. Most of the songs suffer from a surfeit of cliches and hackneyed ideas. The opening lines of Crazy, for example (""You say yes, I say no/You say stop, I say go""), were lifted from Lennon and McCartney, who used them as parody. No parody here. No surprises, either."
3,Up and coming,"There's talent here, and Deborah will emerge as a favorite in time to come. Her approach to blues is fresh, and her voice stays with you after the music is gone. I found it sophmoric that almost every song had to start with a drum ""riff"", sorta like you see with a pickup band. That detracted from my enjoyment of Deborah's otherwise kick-butt performance. Looking forward to her next release...."
2,Horrible stroller,"I bought the ""Take Me Too Tandem Premier"" and I was disappointed almost immediately. The front seat and the sunshade are so small it is a joke. The front sunshade gets stuck during folding and has become bent. The entry to the storage area is narrow and I need to force our small diaper bag in. If the rear seat is reclined, the storage can not be accessed without putting it up and waking your child! I have heard others complain of front wheels falling off, but I have to say mine has never done that in the 16 months I have been using it. They do shake violently though if you walk too fast."
1,wheels fall off,"The front seat is small, and the sun shade for the front seat is also small. The tray broke after only a month of use, but the worst was the rear wheels falling off. My husband was able to fix it, and it worked okay for a little while. Now however, the rear wheels shimmy and are cockeyed -so I never take it for long distances (in case they fall off again and I have to carry both kids). I'd look for another another stroller...."
1,Don't take me too!,"This stroller is horrible. I received it as a gift when my baby was born last year(his older brother was 1 1/2 at the time). After only 2 months the back wheel kept on falling off. We returned it, but the store would only reward even exchange and not store credit, so we were stuck with the same one again. This time the tray and wheel both broke after 3 months. After our second return we thought maybe they had improved the wheel mechanism because it was slightly different when putting it together. It worked again for about 3 months until the whole metal axle in the back snapped and the wheel fell off. We took it back to the store one last time and received yet another new stroller which sits in our garage unopened in the box. Store credit would have been much more valuable because we ended up purchasing a totally different stroller with which I am fairly pleased.Three strikes and you're out evenflo. I will never purchase and or reccomend one of your products again."
1,DANGEROUS! Broken snaps slashed and bloodied my baby!,"Please anyone who owns this stroller check all snaps. The snaps on the rear seat broke and left very sharp and jagged metal. While changing my baby she rubbed her arm against the side and ended up with a 3"" gash on her arm gushing blood. That ended our trip at the zoo. I did not know what cut my daughter until I pulled the pad away and received a nice cut myself. I have used this stroller fewer than 20 times. We have been very gentle on it. I did not realize the snaps had broke because I've always covered the seats.I did call Evenflo and they offered a replacement or a refund. I did not need to provide Evenflo with a receipt or other proof of purchase. So hopefully your child will not be injured and you won't be stuck with a dangerous stroller. -refund check was $149-"
2,Captains log - I've...gotta get out of here...,"No matter what I do now, all I see when Wiliam Shattner comes on the TV is this movie. What a pisser! I think I pulled some chest muscles laughing. Wow - with the best ending of all time no less! It wasn't a half bad plot and the acting was only half bad too. Definitely worthy of sitting on my B grade DVD shelf."
5,Great Film,"I like this film. It has a great cast! such as Anton and Diane LaVey. I also like Borgnine's performing the roll of Jonathan Corbis. I also like the satanic ceremonies which are part of this video. I couldn't see or hear John Travolta because he just had a small part. This is a very great film for me because it has some very good scenes, and great cerimonial voices chanting as they worship Satan. The explosive part where Corbis turned into Satan made me jump out of my skin. I highly recommend this film to all horror movie fans. If you buy this film! you won't regret it."
5,Heaven don't help us............,Many thanks for dark sky's rerelease. Great quality! This film has great actors for a 70's cult classic. It even has Anton Lavey the high preist of the church of satan. Also the dark sky print has a clip of the satanic wedding. Great classic film to own if you into classic devil films!
3,Satanic stew,"The ""Mystery Science Theater"" gang would have a blast with 1975's ""The Devil's Rain,"" a work equally sinister and shlocky. Ernest Borgnine, Eddie Albert and William Shatner get top billing, along with a game Ida Lupino. Young talent includes hero Tom Skerritt and John Travolta, making his film debut as the devil's dolt.Borgnine reportedly refused to do another movie involving satanism after supernatural goings-on during filming, but director Robert Fuest says diplomatically that he, um, hadn't heard anything about that. ""If you stop and analyze (the movie), you get into trouble,"" Fuest cautions. The director, a proper English gentleman, has some good tales to tell about this production and others.""Rain"" was made with the ""special participation"" of Church of Satan founder Anton LaVey, who's seen marrying a lucky couple in a newsreel extra."
4,"""Damn you Corbis""","So cool, yeah maybe its not an Academy Award winner but its still fun to watch on a rainy night or any other night for that matter."
3,weird and disturbing,"During the opening credits,a series of paintings depicting ""life in hell"" are shown as the sound of shrill screams and a dark melody play in unison. As I read on I saw the name of that satanic priest,Anton Lavey.(Is he still alive?) He was somehow connected to this film, which for some would make it worth seeing, from a curiosity standpoint. If you liked John Carpenter's Vampires you may like this. It has similar overtones. There are some good chase scenes, and alot of suspense. Cool devil makeup. By the way ,the producers of this film also made THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE and DEEP THROAT (FYI)."
5,Excellent old Shatner Movie,"This is a classic old Shatner horror movie. It's excellent. Devil's Rain is about a family that's being followed by a Devil Worshipping cult down in Texas. It's got good makeup and effects and if you look closely, John Travolta plays one of the ""eyeless"" worshippers. This tape is a must have for classic horror movie fans. And the ending doesn't disappoint. It leaves you wishing for a sequel. END"
1,"Sucks, don't bother.","I understand it's an older movie but the acting is bad, special effects are bad and it's not well written at all. Don't waste your time."
1,not a good movie,"this movie wastn what I expected or maybe it was, this is just one of thoes 70's horror films with a sorry story line and nothing else.if you are a colletor of william shatner films this buy this movie or if you like the old low budget horrer then this is for you. but other wise stay away from this movie."
3,A rare glimpse into authentic satanic horror.,"""The Devil's Rain"" is a flawed, but worthy attempt to combine genuine satanic worship with dramatic horror. Anton LaVey, founder of the Church of Satan and author of 1969's ""The Satanic Bible"" served as technical advisor on this film; it contains numerous satanic ceremonies, which makes this movie stand apart from standard satanic-cult flick nonsense. For those who are interested in trivium, Anton Szandor LaVey died in 1997 at the age of 67."
2,It didn't work for my wife,This product may not work for everyone. My Wife tried it but it didn't help at all. I think every human is different so you just have to try it and see if it works. In my case we were not lucky enough for this to work. But at least I am satisfied that I tried everything.
1,Terrible Customer Service,These bands are great!! BUT order elsewhere. Thank God I did not place a large order with this company! The picture clearly shows grey bands and it does not say that colors may vary. THESE ARE BLACK. Which all in all is not that big of a deal except that I already have them in black and since I live in them I wanted some that would draw a little less attention to my wrists. The company will replace them as long as I pay shipping both ways and they refuse to take any responsibility for the misleading advertising. Can't say enough good about the bands though! They are great!!
2,Doesn't work at all!,Did not work for me. Made no difference and is hard to tell if it is placed correctly. Not too comfy either.
4,Handy text to have,"This may be slightly out-dated when it comes to modern critisim, but it is very handy to have around. Concise and covers not just the Bard, but the plays around which may have influenced him. Amazon should get some copies!"
4,need to be a part 3.,love the series but i want to see more. what happen happen to everyone? what going to happen to cross academy? is there still a night class? what happen yuki and kaname? dose zero become a full vampire hunter? dose he still want to kill yuki for beig a vampire? so many qustion yes but they need to be answer that why they need to make apart 3. i be so thankful.
2,Wow... How sad.,"This series was essentially ruined in how the hypocritical story turned out, and all the characters were ruined. It's not even all the story, the manga goes farther, and there is little explanation and much unrealism. Disappointed."
3,problem,the first disc in the series only had episodes 1-4 on it. i was all excited to watch the whole series but i couldnt cuz on the first disc there were only 4 episodes
2,Poor Quality Control,"The main reason I purchased this card is because it's overclocked from the factory and hence should be reliable. Well, I thought wrong.The memory cannot run at 1.6GHz. Polygon artifacts are all over the place in games that are 3D intensive. Odd polygons stretching into infinite space, blocking your entire view on screen, or just simply missing.The only way to remedy the problem is to underclock the memory. Different people have different results. But I had to turn mine down to 490 MHz from 800 Mhz (down to 980 MHz from 1600 MHz). Which is hugely disappointing considering the reason why I bought the card in the first place."
1,Decimal Point?,"Whoever posted this must have forgotten their caffeine fix.Sells for less than $5 on auction sites, yet it is priced at over $200There are no drivers for this to work on VistaA complete zero stars product"
4,"Great, Year 2001 Guide To Jewelry Collectibles",Brand new book featuring 304 pages with 400 nice black and white photos and a 16 page full color section. There is a useful introductory section describing the collectible. Each item description is quite detailed to help identify specific jewelry items. Major topics range from Antique (1800 to 1920) to Modern (1920 to 1960's). It is a very complete up-to-date guide that will be of interest and value to jewelry collectors.
1,90% Diamond Jewelry 10% Bad Photos,This book sucks. I was looking for a book on costume jewelry. There were 30 pages devoted to costume jewelry and 400 pages devoted to diamond jewelry. The photos are so dark that you can't see what is in the picture. There are too many pieces of jewelry that don't have any photos at all. You have to guess what they might be talking about. Keep your money and buy something else.
4,Refreshing take on an old subject.,Amazingly fresh take on relationships. Focuses on the angle of how friends and family can affect one's marriage. If you are tired of the same old stories in romantic movies then this one might be for you.
1,Pedestrian,"This movie sinks to a low level of relationship between husband and wife. Why would anyone want to watch this is beyond me. Not entertaining, not a great storyline, and presents a depressing style of life."
3,Boring,This movie is more of a documentary style on marriage & honestly I didn't make it past the first 15 minutes. This movie couldn't hold my interest. Maybe others will have great luck with it and enjoy the movie. It wasn't for me though.
1,Crap,This movie is horrible. No comedy. Obnoxious annoying shallow characters. Not worth the watch. Go make cookies or something. Waste of $3.99.
4,Trio of female leads were excellent,well written... well acted.... sound and editing were poor....the trio of female leads were excellent....well done for a low budget film
4,"Edward Burns, need I say more?","It was listed as a comedy. I don't think it was a comedy, more a drama. But it was a good movie. Not the best movie I've seen by far, but a good way to spend a couple hours."
4,Great Value,"I've had this set for over a year and love it. The cooking is great and the pans still look like new. This is a great set to start out with that you won't out grow. One word of caution - do use oil or butter as necessary. Non-stick doesn't mean non-burn. I purchased this set, plus a bonus piece, at a lower price at Filene's during a sale."
5,Great Product - Great Price,"This attractive cookware is absolutely great for cooking non or low-fat foods and NOTHING sticks! I love this set, although if you have a large family you might want to consider purchasing a larger frying pan also. It works well with the olive oil mister to promote healthy cooking with more flavor (you are not supposed to use non-stick cooking spray with non-stick cookware). Cleanup is an absolute breeze no matter what you make. A couple of downsides are that the handles get really hot, so you need to use hot pads to remove from the stove and and there are no covers to fit the frying pans -- although I believe this is typical of cookware sets."
4,CD is Aptly Subtitled: Ultimate Cinematic Compendium,"The whole series could not be a more brilliant showcase of the dedication behind ""background"" music of 1960's & 1970's Italian movies - that just because they are ""scores"" does NOT mean they can't be brilliant on their own as - this particular CD seems to comprise mostly of kick-**s jazz jams & fun lounge easy listening tracks so it's a little less diverse than than the others in the series but still great!"
4,Word of mouth goes along way!,"I have two peices from Farberware. A regular electric skillet and a electric pancake skillet that I received as a wedding gift 3 years ago. They have been great, but after receiving the reveiws that others have entered regarding the customer service that Farberware provides, I do not think I will ever buy anything from them. It sounds as if they are pretty consistant with ""not"" helping their customers when they have a defective product. A company should always have the attitude that the customer is always right. Although,we all know we can be wrong, Farberware would still come out ahead."
1,Total waste of money,"I bought the millennium cookware set when I got marries 4 1/2 years ago believing in the hype. What a joke! On all of my pots the nonstick coating is flaking off. I no longer use them to cook with because I do not want to eat the coating. A total waste of money. The pots are not even worth the one star I gave it but, amazon does not give the option of giving zero stars in a review."
1,warranty not honored,"I bought a set of these pans a few years ago. The worked well enough for a while but the surface did wear off. I sent them in for warranty service and was given a big run around, with several assurances that the repaired pots were on the way. They never returned the pots and I've given up trying to get them back."
5,The Best Pans I have Ever Had!,"What a deal, I payed way more for this set then what amazon has it for. But the product after four years of wear and tear are still as good as new. I cook with this set every day and couldn't be happier. I have never had to deal with the company for any problems so I can't speak on that. But if you need a set that has lots of different pan sizes this is for you."
4,Excellent value,"I bought the mp704 after being enticed by the [$$$] rebate and sale price in January. Set up was remarkably easy. Picture quality is great. 1 dead pixel, not in a bothersome location.On the specs, I e-mailed their tech support. The higher specs listed on their web site are correct, not the lower specs in the guide in the box. 500:1 contrast and 25ms response. The explanation is that their componenets are improving all of the time.I also found out that most of their 17 inch monitors use the same LCD. The only thing that paying for the speakers and such of the higher end models gets you is those bells and whistles. The picture quality is the same.I'd say quite a deal"
2,Image color got lost,"I read the online review and thought it is a nice one. It turns out the image and text is fuzzy and make my eyes tired. When viewing photo image, many colors are missing even I set 32-bit true color. I am going to return this one."
3,Cornea MP704B 17,"i really wanted to like this monitor. it comes in a nice, sleek package and was very easy to set-up. color was acceptable, as well as response time. however, text was fuzzy no matter what i did to adjust. not terrible, but not as sharp as i had expected. in the end, this monitor went back to amazon (which still has the best return policy in the universe!). ..."
4,Pleased with Purchase,"It took almost no time to set up and attach to my Dell 4100. I hit the auto button and it sized perfectly. The driver for it was odd.. I couldn't tell if the XP driver was used or the Cornea one. I downloaded the latest from their site. Still not sure what is actually getting used but it doesn't matter the monitor works fine.Only other odd thing was an additional software package on the disk called cromaster (or such) no real documentation could tell what it was for. Kept getting error messages saying something like ""not configured"". I blew it away. I think it might have been a color matching software.I'd give it a 5 star if it wasn't for the oddness of the driver and cromaster software."
5,Love it!,"I received this monitor a couple of weeks ago and have had absolutely no problems with it. I LOVE it--it's so much easier on my eyes than my CRT, and the Amazon price beat every retail outlet in my city. I don't know what these other reviews are talking about because my monitor works perfectly. And this monitor takes up so little space!FYI: I set the brightness on 52 and the contrast ratio on 36. The screen area I set 1024 by 768 pixels."
1,I returned this monitor...,"I just returned this monitor because of problems that I've had with it. First, the picture was blurry. I tried changing the resolution but that didn't seem to help. I then tried contacting the Cornea technical support folks. The documentation that came with the monitor gave an email address for technical support. It's been over a week since I sent the email, and I still haven't heard back from Cornea. The other day was the last straw for me. I had a power outage at my house and the monitor went dead on me. Nothing else at home (linux server, firewall, laptop, etc.) had any problems coming back up, so I'm ruling out any sort of a power spike. I tested the electrical outlet after getting power back to make sure I was getting juice. There was nothing wrong with the outlet, but I wasn't able to get the monitor to power back up. I've gone back to my old monitor and am much happier with it after the experience I've had with this Cornea monitor."
1,Didn't Work!,"Obviously since it didn't work I can't give it top billing. I looked at all the reviews and was very impressed with the price and praise. I was thrilled with the design - it looked great - until I turned it on. The screen was not adjusting right, and for those who sometimes do counter-reviews saying ""if you only tried this"" well I called the company and talked with their people who said it was a bad monitor and to send it back. Once my new one comes, I will hopefully be able to revise this and say how wonderful the monitor is - but looking at reviews online and not on Amazon, it isn't quite as perfect a monitor as the amazon reviews make it out to be :)"
2,Fuzzy picture!,"It's true: you get what you pay for. I was very excited to find a 17-inch LCD selling for [$] (after rebate), but the picture turned out to be atrocious. I tried it with two different machines running different video cards, so that wasn't the problem. I then set up a ViewSonic LCD I happened to have on hand and it looked dramatically sharper. Based on the other reviews here, I suppose I could have gotten a bad unit. But I have to advise anyone who does a lot of word processing or Web browsing to steer clear of this monitor. It's really hard on the eyes. NOTE: Huge kudos to Amazon.com, which not only shipped the monitor here for free, but provided a prepaid UPS label when I decided to return it. That's incredible service."
5,Australian buyer CORNEA MP704,"Purchased online which is a scary prospect - was worth it - I have one stuck pixel which doesn't bother me.We have 21"" Samsung TFT's at work - perhaps they're not on native resolution, but this thing seems so much clearer.Haven't established yet though if the warranty carries to Australia"
3,Why do you get a flatscreen?,"That is the question. One of the major reasons is to regain desktop space: this one does it. Another one, to save electricity, hopefully: can be argued in its favor too. Even the price plays in favor of the Cornea MP704B 17"" LCD Monitor, the best deal in flatscreens at the time we were shopping for one a few weeks ago. Now, one thing that this beauty doesn't do: display with cripsness. Unfortunately, in spite of following the guidelines provide to auto-tune it, etc. bold fonts in particular are very fuzzy, which is a one-way ticket to headache land. So, save yourself and do some more shopping. This sure is a bargain, but not a good LCD, unfortunately. In fact, we're returning it and settling for the loss of desktop space for now."
2,You get what you pay for...,"The low price and high contrast ratio (500:1) attracted me to this monitor, but I'd have to say that it is not a very versatile monitor. It does graphics well enough, but text and small pictures are very blurry unless you have it set at the full 1280X1024, and anybody who can read anything on a monitor with that resolution should seek therapy. I tried it for a couple of days and it gave me headaches, words were so small I had to have my face 3 inches from the screen to read anything. I returned the monitor, I don't need anymore eye strain than I already get at work."
4,almost perfect,The case is almost perfect. If it had a way to store the headphones it would exactly right.
3,It's okay...,"It's very cute, and it holds the ipod well. However, it doesn't have anywhere to put a belt clip, and there isn't a place to store the earbuds."
5,"SmartWool, Smart Purchase","Product is everything it is advertised to be, comfortable, durable and keep your feet dry. Also, they are not your average looking sock. Only drawback for me is that they are thinner than the socks I have been wearing so I have to cinch up my shoe laces for a comfortable fit. Won't be a problem with my next tennies, however, as I am switching away from my old sox."
2,Disappointed in Product,The shipper was excellent and even replaced one pair of socks at no charge due to a manufacturing flaw. But my biggest disappointment was that the socks did not last longer than 10 wearings. The heels completely wore out. These socks cost $15....for that price they should last longer.
3,"Cute and comfortable, but they bunch up in the dryer","I like the feel of the wool on my feet - they are snug and warm, without my feet getting hot. I also like these colors and have received a lot of compliments. My complaint is that after washing and drying, they become crumpled up, slightly fuzzy and they are like a trap for any hair that was in the machine. I'm not sure if that happens with all wool socks but it's an annoyance. That said, these are very durable, with no holes in the heels or toes after almost a year."
3,I'm disappointed,"I've hear so much about Smartwool socks and I was excited to get these. These socks look great - exactly as pictured. Unfortunately, they are tight around my leg (leave marks) if I pull them up all of the way and I do not have especially large legs (slim but muscular). I also didn't feel that they kept my feet any warmer than some high quality cotton socks that I usually wear. I won't be purchasing anymore given their price point."
4,"Great socks, great company","Not only are these great socks, but I,m impressed with the customer service. When my socks were damaged, they responded quickly, answered my questions, and replaced my socks. I like a company that truly backs their products!"
1,What a joke.,"This sock is thinner than your average everyday sock. If you're looking for a true wool sock, look elsewhere. You can easily find a better sock (and much cheaper) at Target or WalMart. This sock couldn't keep a sheep's feet warm."
3,Not crazy about these socks.,"Seems like a lot to pay for fairly thin socks. The design is cute as a button but it also creates something of a ridged surface which isn't particularly comfortable. I'll wear them, but given the cost, I wouldn't recommend them."
4,light yet warm,I'm one of those people who is almost always cold . I wanted something that I could wear that wouldn't cramp my feet in my everyday shoes yet keep them reasonably warm. These do just that . I have washed them several times with no fading or shrinking..
2,Not worth the price!,"I read the reviews and was expecting some sort of great feeling for the socks in general. They are just socks! They feel and perform just like the several $4.00 pairs. Nothing more, nothing less. If you want to pay almost $20 for a pair of socks, go ahead but I won't."
5,"Warm, nice",These feel very nice and are warm and comfortable and pretty. What more can one say about a pair of socks? That they fit into my shoes. That they kept me from getting frostbitten toes. That the stripes would be good camouflage on a coral reef perhaps but I didn't wear them when I went snorkeling.
3,Not exactly what I expected,"I love the colors. but I thought they would be a little thicker. However, they seem to be warm so far. I worry about the ribbing and elastic around the top and whether it will hold its shape because it isn't staying up on my leg. Keeps falling and I have to pull them up."
5,Great socks,Love these socks. Comfortable and wear great. I wear them in thinly lined boots and my feet stay quite warm.
5,Very Smart Wool!,These socks are very well made and very durable. They keep your feet cool in warm weather and warm in cooler weather. Great for hiking or everyday wear! I love the funky colors!
2,Works good for first year,"I loved these sock when I got them! I only wear socks in the winter, and I got these last winter for Christmas. Now, as I sit at the computer, I am wearing them. Unfortunately, the hanes white socks that I also purchased last winter are in much better shape than these. These have worn very thin on the soles and the left one even has a hole in the heel. It pains me, since they cost so much to just throw them away after 1 year of use (not even that as stated earlier), but it seems I will keep using the hanes and stay away from smartwool. I also have 3 other pairs that I bought after receiving these because I loved them so much. They also have been worn through. It seems to be a flaw with smartwool, in my opinion."
3,"Socks are good, ordering wasn't","I think these socks are fine, but the order from Amazon left something to be desired. On their site, the socks were available only in S, M, and L with no description of corresponding shoe size. I guessed that my wife's size 6 shoe would be a medium. I ordered two pair. As it turns out, each pair got shipped from a different company (neither was Amazon). Only when I got documentation from those companies did I find that the size medium corresponds to a shoe size 7-9.5. Basically, the socks are too big for my wife. This info should have been available on the Amazon order page."
2,I'd like to rewrite the last three pages.,"Usually I find the Berenstain Bears series books to carry solid, helpful messages for kids. The books are certainly the major kindergarten collection of choice in our house. However, I believe Stan and Jan missed the mark on this one. The other synopsis notes mention reference to an ""unavailable text."" I wonder if the current edition has a few major revisions"
1,The principal at my school took this one out of the library,"I couldn't believe this book. Basically it has the kid who got beat up by the bully go home and learn to beat up bullies, then go to school and actually beat up the bully. In the end, no one gets into trouble...they even mention that the parents weren't called. What kind of lesson are they trying to teach? I was horrified...I was reading this book to my child, and at the end we both said ""huh?"" I was hoping to teach him about practical ways to handle bullies, but all the book told him was that he should be one himself. Read this one for yourself (but before you read it aloud to the kids...)"
1,Pass this one by,"We love the Berenstain Bears books - most of the time. This one, however, isn't worth the trouble. Not to mention that I'm not sure how to explain to my three-year-old what the school psychologist is! I think that the book has good intentions, but frankly it isn't as well-written as others and the message is garbled and ill-advised. In my experience, the older ""classic"" BB books are better than the newer ones, and this is no exception."
2,A little harsh...,"I'm not a huge fan of the Berenstain Bears books, but thought I would give this one a try, since I wanted to talk with my 6 year old about bullying. Be forewarned -- Sister Bear is the one that is ""bullied,"" and she is basically completely beat up by the bully. Brother Bear teaches her how to ""fight back"" by punching, hitting, kicking a large bag of beans in the basement. Furthermore, when Sister and the Bully (also a girl) have to go the principal's office, it comes out that the Bully is physically abused (spanked) at home, and Sister Bear ""realizes"" that the reason the girl hits others is because she is hit by her parents.So please know that you may need to address the issue of physical abuse, and that the book does not advocate a peaceful resolution to the situation."
1,The Wrong Message,This book is positively appalling. It conveys the message that violence is the appropriate response to bullying. What in the world were the Berenstains -- or whoever their ghost writer was -- thinking when they wrote this?
2,Not so good ending...,"This was OK, but I didn't like the ending so much. Self defense I agree with when it comes to bullys, but the author should have elaborated a little better on the ending or changed it all together."
2,"Sent in error, instead of ""JUdaism as Civilization"" by Kaplan.","Sent in error. I ordered ""Judaism as Civilization"" by Mordecai Kaplan. Error repeated when I re-ordered.The Passover Book is actually quite nice and with lots of pictures, probably appealing to children."
2,2 MUCH LEFT OUT!,"i really like PASCALE BUSSIERES AS AN ACTRESS BUT IN THIS MOVIE I FELT SOME PARTS ARE LEFT OUT I COULD BE WRONG BUT THATS WHAT IT SEEMED. IN THIS MOVIE SHE WAS BETTER OFF GOING 2 A SPERM BANK IF SHE JUST WANTED A BABY AND NO HUSBAND IT WAS ALRIGHT, TO GO THROUGH ALL OF THAT AND TO GET NOTHING."
5,Cyberfunks' meddling,"This was the first album of the power trio to go GOLD on 07/06/70. It also went to platinum in 12/03/91 to prove that customers do enjoy this album to buy it on a cd format. Much to the dismay to Cyberfunk fan base, I was single out to prevent a purchase of this album. The seller continue business and no other attempts have been stop other albums sales of this group and other artist. Cyberfunk wishes for their 2 cents for other members shares in the current line-up nGFR. The FLINT album will never see a cd prodution."
2,Too drawn out.,"This is a story that starts out OK, but fizzles. I liked the characters, but they never stopped talking. There was no tension, or suspense--once the plot moved from the U.S. to England the villians were obvious. I found myself skipping pages to get to some action. There is some humor, but not enough. Also, the ending seemed a little rushed and contrived."
2,"good premise, disappointing writing","This book has what could have been an interesting story line. A female Pinkerton detective in England caught in a masquerade as the estranged wife of a (predictably) handsome, dashing duke. What will happen? Why/how did the duke's brother and heir to the title and estate die? Who has been trying to kill Yancey, the Pinkerton detective? And what happened to the duke's actual wife? I wish the author had invested the effort to make the characters and the writing fit the time period. I know it is a paperback romance, but I wish the writing was just better in general. It was okay, and if enough time goes by I may remember only the premise and want to reread it, but it won't be on the strength of the writing. So disappointing, because I love a good historical romance and this was almost, but not quite, one of them."
2,A Literary Eulogy,"William Borden was a wealthy Ivy League graduate with a singular focus on serving God. His intellect and his devotion are revealed, in part, by extended exerpts from personal correspondence in Borden's family. The story is not comprehensive and the presentation falls well short of a biography. It is more a collection of disconnected anecdotes in chronological order. Though Borden's missionary zeal is well established his most important relationships are not fully developed. This makes for something less than a satisfying story. The subject, however, is a truly interesting personality with an inspiring conviction. Borden's evangelistic accomplishments are unusual and one wonders what he might have achieved had his life not been shortened suddenly at an early age."
5,THE best Rock & Roll Christmas album ever,"This album has quite a history. It was originally released in 1963 on the day JFK was assassinated. Nobody was in a holiday mood that year, but the album has since become THE album to which all other rock & roll holiday albums are compared. Every song is a winner and Phil's greeting is a nice way to end it.Of course Phil is busy for the next several years behind bars. Ironically Phil was born on the day after Christmas. If there's one thing he'll probably be remembered for professionally it's probably this album. Often imitated, never quite duplicated. Only Motown's holiday albums come close. If you like rock & roll and Christmas music, this album SHOULD be in your collection."
2,Disco Pants,"If you are looking for something made with natural fibers, keep looking. These feel 80+% polyester."
2,"I agree, no good!","I mean..people that belong the scene can understand this book and find it funny..but this can reforce labels that most people have, goths are just teenagers playing dressing trying to get attention..com'on, you guys!!I know is nice to say to an all-black-dressed-depressed-face-poser ""smile, goth!=D"", but goth it's not just this remember???I think Goth Chic is still the best bookA big label that this one brings..since when being goth is just make fun of yourself and the scene, hun???This way the serious side of the scene will die, really..nowadays in the scene, when you try to talk to someone something serious, the only thing they can do is laugh..THE ONLY..ps:sorry any language mistakes, my first language is portuguese"
1,"How sad that you enjoy being identified as ""Silly""","...and someone to be laughed at.Yes, there are silly, silly moonbats out there who think that they are vampires (so *not* goth, ok?) as they retire to the ""crypt"" of mom's basement, where they will awake the next morning and eat Frosted Flakes before raking the leaves (Undead, indeed!).But is Voltaire laughing at them? With them? At himself? Or at you?He looks the part, he has infiltrated your world, only to mock you and profit from you.For a true Goth who is not delusional or playing dress-up once a week at a club or school, this is offensive.Voltaire is the ultimate poseur, and look at all of the cash that you throw at him. I salute him for turning Goth into the money making venture that the rest of us could never achieve.Voltaire my old friend, SALUTE!"
3,Not a dog,"This may be a little explicit...This film is a great, but odd piece of French 70s sleaze-horror, from the maker of ""Dr.Jekyll and his Women"", and ""Immoral Tales.""It starts off in a castle where two horses are coupling. Once you've got over that (guys, don't feel inadequate; girls, don't go there!). A woman arrives to catch the tail end of this scene. She's come to marry. But the castle's family have a curse.She visits the curse in a dream where at first we see a 1700s rural scene, and a woman chased by a bear like creature that's got a very big, hard knob, with a very painful looking buldge on the end (how on earth it's going to fit in her?!)Then we go to more modern times where another woman, in another dream is chased by the monster. She gets it off with her feet before kissing it.I hope I've not offended anyone by this description. If I have, don't buy the film. Though the reverse may not be true."
1,Banned?!,"'It is to this day banned in England!' giggled a previous reviewer. Gosh - aren't you so much more sophisticated and liberated than we stuffy types back in the old-country.Well, I can't comment on the DVD version but I did laugh like a drain when I saw an (uncut) version of this on the telly (yes, the TV - in England, where, of course it's banned) a few months back. If a guy in an an unconvincing gorilla suit with a monster dildo masquerading as a real penis, splashing cream over a naked woman in the forest is your bag, then this is the film for you.Personally, I think anyone who (ahem) swallows this film as any kind of serious attempt to explore sexual taboos (or whatever it's supposed to be) has got to be up in the trees themselves."
3,Not what I thought it would be!,"It wasnt that erotic of a movie at all. It was about a women who goes into the woods for whatever reason and meets a beast. At first she finds the beast scary but by force begins to have [relations] with the beast. She has [contacts] with the beast so much the beast dies... Maybe I missed the point, but it was not what I thought it would be! has anyone seen Baise Moi?"
1,Garbage!,I don't know what the director was thinking when he made this film. Who produced it? These guys must have been dropping some serious acid! The horse copulation scene was a bit too much. But the beast copulation scene was nauseating to say the least. The film had absolutely no plot whatsoever. The characters were wooden nymphos with serious psych problems. This film is wierd and one of a kind but the novelty wears off pretty quickly. In other words: AVOID AT ALL COST!
2,I'm still laughing,"If your buying this movie for the sex. Unless you like a lot of laughing don't bother. A far better movie from Walerian is Immoral tales. This movie is quite explicit. But what was Walerian thinking of. Two horses mating for about 10 minutes, did we need to get that explicit. The beast looks like a bear and well what a great capacity for sex, hovever it does kill the poor fella in the end out of exhaustion. I think you should leave this one alone. unless your into collecting movies from directors."
3,Film Class,"Sometimes I read the bad reviews 1st to find out why people didn't like the thing I'm interested in. I saw 'La bete' while taking film classes at Hunter College, NYC, (late 70's). Screening it was one of the requirements. This was when an 'Art Film' could play at a theater 6 months, a year or longer. I think we we warned about the sexual nature, the horses copulating. I'm curious to see now what the redeeming artistic value of this film is as, back then, I really didn't get it. But the reviewers who seem to think that this is some attempt at soft core porn, from my recollection, haven't got it either. Guess I'll have to see it again, for myself."
4,Sexiest film ever?,"You have to see it to believe it, and be a little twisted to appreciate what you'll be seeing. One of the oddest stories I have seen in a while without being confusing, and a soon-to-be classic, without a doubt and with my hope."
2,BEAUTY AND THE BEAST vs. Benny Hill vs. Upstairs Downstairs,"Well, you can go ahead and start hitting the negative vote button cause I don't understand people's attraction to this movie. A horse with a large wang bangs another horse. Some people walk around an English manor and talk a lot. A whole lot. Stopping only long enough for a woman to rub her delicate part on the foot of a bed.Finally at the 61 minute mark a woman walking in the woods is chased and attacked by a large wookalar looking creature with a giant dong. She fights him off for a few minutes but finally he gets it his way...and she likes it! They continue on for a while until he falls over dead and she buries him with leaves. The End.Why all that had to take 98 minutes is inexcusable. This movie shouldn't have run longer than 20 minutes. Plus none of the women were even attractive, so outside of the monster with the spurting unit it's all completely forgettable."
2,Maybe I missed something but this movie was terrible,"This movie in my opinion is one of the worst movie I have ever seen No plot no real storyline except if your into watching horses have sex graphically, kind of a horse XXX movie. No true horror moments just some dude in a bear suit doing it with a hot blonde and the african american house boy screwing the masters daughter twice. Not sure where all the great storytelling is or the in depth plot must be another ""beast"" movie out there everyone is talking about because it sure is not this movie. I gave it two stars only for the blonde in the movie..."
2,review on the beast,The movie arrived in good condition but the movie itself was a big blowoff for me. It is a little corny unless you like that kind of stuff.
5,incredible,"You have not seen anything like this. It is amazing that this film is even available, I guess that's why it was banned for 25 years. I won't tell the surprise, but it is definetely not for kids as it is not the Beauty and The Beast, but an outrageous erotic version of it. If you want to surprise a friend or an enemy buy this for them."
1,Save your money - stay away,"I bought this thinking that it would be an erotic feast. Nothing could be further from the truth. This is a dismal movie, no story line, no beautiful bodies, no hot sex, nothing.The climax of the movie is when you see the heroine naked (just for a few minutes). Reading the reviews here, I thought that it would be full of wild hot sex. No such thing.This is a disgusting movie and a lame excuse to take your money. STAY AWAY."
1,War Brides - A disappointing read,"War Brides is the story of three Australian women who marry US servicemen, and journey to the start their new lives with their new husbands in a new land.The book's title had so much potential and I looked forward to reading how these Australian women survived living on the other side of the world, without their loved ones, and relying on the support from one another in a foreign land.Unfortunately, I found the novel nothing more than a soapy story of three women, who just happened to be Australian, who fell into different marriage situations.What I thought would be a challenging and informative story, ended up being just a trashy cross between a Jilly Cooper and Harold Robbins novel, with the occasional Australian expression thrown in.I found it a very disappointing read."
1,Don't waste your time or money!,"I was really looking forward to reading this book and was pretty much disappointed. The story just sort of drones on and doesn't seem to have a point. There was little interaction with the women after they got off the ship and little understanding of their needs as foreigners in America; they just had the same problems that most women have in their day to day struggles. I wanted to know about the differences and how they handled them. I also didn't like that after one of the characters got a divorce, her ex and his new fiance got as much coverage (even though they were Americans), but there was never a conclusion to their problems."
1,Black Spots on Vitamins,"I purchased Yummi Bears Multi-Vitamin & Mineral for my three year old daughter and I discovered that the vitamins were covered in black spots. As I have used Yummi Bears in the past without problem, I returned to the store to see if the problem was isolated or if it applied to the lot. All of the vitamins in lot HN11881A at the Vitamin Shoppe in Falls Church, VA also contained the spots.I have since been in contact with Hero Nutritional Products LLC; they are having the product tested at that lab. Their original speculation was that the spots were caused by fruit; I have purchased multiple bottles of these vitamins in past and this is the first time I have encountered the ""fruit"" spots. As a precaution, I contacted the FDA and they are researching the matter. I do not recommend these vitamins."
1,"Not for vegans, has gelatin","I ordered this because it showed up in searches for vegetarian vitamins. However, on receipt, I found out that these vitamins have gelatin in them. So do not order if you want gelatin-free vitamins."
1,Safety seal broken,"Beside the fact that the safety seal was busted upon arrival, all of the gummies were hot and melted together. I'll pay the extra $7 and buy it at the vitamin store next time."
4,Good for What's Inside,"We've been using these vitamins for the last two years. They contain the vitamins you want, without many of the filler items you don't. We don't do a lot of sugar in our house and so these vitamins are considered a special ""vitamin treat"" for our girls."
3,Good but not for my Sensory baby girl!,"I bought these for my little girl that has Sensory Processing Disorder. We have tried several gummy vitamins in the past with her only picking out the red gummies. I ordered these because I wanted to find a good tasting all red/cherry vitamin. Much to my surprise, they were not red. I understand that would be artificial coloring, but when you have a child with SPD, you tend to bend the rules a bit to help her get what she needs. I will be sending these back with a quest for the perfect vitamin for my girl."
5,good product at great price,we love these; they don't have that vitamin taste; the price is way better than what I had paid in store
1,Whatever you do DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!!,"My tech school teacher is using this book to ""teach"" us C++. I already know C++ myself, and this book is HORRIBLE. ALMOST EVERY SINGLE PROGRAM HAS ERRORS!!! If I'm exaggerating, it's not by much. If I could give this book a custom number of stars, I would RATE IT A NEGATIVE NUMBER!! A majority of the programs DON'T COMPILE without MODIFICATION TO THE CODE. If you don't know C++, you WON'T HAVE THE KNOW-HOW TO MAKE CHANGES THAT ARE NEEDED TO COMPILE ANY OF THE PROGRAMS. One exercise looks like the author thought he was programming in BASIC: there are no semi-colons to end the statements, and the if else statements looked like BASIC. I apologize for my annoying caps review, but I want to make sure that NOBODY BUYS THIS BOOK. WHATEVER YOU DO, FOR GOODNESS' SAKES, DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!!!! I don't care what the other readers say, listen to the negative reviews: they know what they're talking about. Oh, and DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!!!!"
1,"A dangerously friendly, inaccurate book","The author of this book does not know the C++ language. He makes every typical mistake a book could make -- main returning void, use of pre-standard headers, fails to mention namespaces except as an annoyance present in some new compilers. This might be more understandable if the book was written before the C++ Standard was published in 1998, but in 2001 this is no way to be teaching C++.By presenting this book as a friendlier introduction to C++ (the author goes so far as to call it perfect), it's likely to appeal to people who won't be aware of how badly they are being taught C++. ...Advanced C++ users won't be fooled by the author's hype..."
4,"Read a loaner, looked 15 years for my own copy.","I feel the book, penned by a kinsman, was a little slanted. However, if this man had been of my family, it would have been several volumns in length.Wade Hampton was an exceptional human being. Not enough has been written about his standing as a businessman, familyman, soldier, and especially as a statesman."
5,Armor around your valuable laptop,"Now I have an Ipad so I don't travel with a laptop. When I traveled with my wide screen laptop I tried and returned several cases and with this one finally found something that would fit that laptop well. I won't go into ALL the bells and whistles of this bag, as you can read about them elsewhere, but there are many.When I traveled there was NO concern with my laptop being damaged.It is an invaluable travel business tool. I love that it holds so much and is so versatile and durable."
