5,A Great 3-in-1 Appliance,"Replaced an older (but good) waffle iron that was more difficult to clean. I love that I can submerge the 'plates' of this grill and waffle baker to clean them. Easy to use, easy to clean! It's a good thing!"
2,Unstable and high burn danger,This would have been a good product but the reversible plates are poorly secured and the rear hinge cannot be locked into either position causing it to be very unstable. Every metal surface becomes extremely hot and is a high burn danger. It makes great waffles--but how badly do you want a waffle?
1,NO good !!!,I was so disapointed to learn that the first time my friend used this (it was a b-day gift) the spring holding the top plate was so cheap it just fell on to her food when opening the lid. I am embarrassed to have to return it for her. I expected more of Black and Decker.
3,grilling,Just used to grill a sandwich. Sandwich has to be awful thin to grill closed. It slid all over the place otherwise.
2,Missing hinge part - no instructions,The waffle iron was missing a pin and retaining clip from one of the hinges. Luckily I found the parts in the plastic bag around the waffle iron and was able to put it back into place. No instructions came with the waffle iron although the imprint on the bottom tells you to refer to the manual for use and cleaning instructions. It is difficult to know how long to leave the waffles in without some guidance. We have had several different types and they are all different. Hard to know for sure without some instructions.
1,appears used,"This product appears used with several scratches on both plates, the bottom plate won't seat correctly. The temperature dial is very loose. Under the plates looks like the product might have been refurbished or used in the past."
3,"Good deal, works, but not that sturdy",The waffle plate fell out a few times while making waffles. It seems to take a long time to warm up for use. The waffles do cook evenly and does not stick. I think it should be priced lower considering the quality.
4,This waffle iron is tradional!,"OMG I cant believe I found this iron! I have been looking for the traditional old fashion waffle iron and this is it! My parents had one sorta like it when I was younger, so I was delighted to find it. The only thing is I wish the style of the iron was more up to date. I wish I could have given it 4 1/2 stars instead of 4. Over all it works fine and waffles came out superb!"
5,black & decker waffle maker,"better made than others I looked at. Makes a nice waffle,I like the little squares, Its like the ones Grandma used to make."
1,Terrible Product,"This waffle maker is horrible. My waffles split in half because they stick to the surface. Also, I cannot open the device all the way or the plates fall out. I bought this product awhile back because it had pretty good reviews, but I am not sure why!"
3,"Ok, but cheap.","As the title says, this works perfectly fine - but that's all. It is easy to use and easy to clean, but the heating elements are a bit far apart and so it cooks a bit unevenly - especially when making waffles."
5,waffles = Mmmmmmmm,"Do you know how hard it is to find a waffle maker that makes thin crispy waffles? I do. In this Belgian waffle loving time, it was a long search till I looked on Amazon, & found exactly what I was looking for. I recommend this particular Brand & style to anyone who prefers thin waffles. Also good for making enough to refrigerate & toast later."
2,it has been lopsided since one leg and the waffle iron tilted,"I am sure I would have liked the waffle iron, but I did not use it because it was crooked. The waffles would have been lopsided since one leg was shorter than the orders and the waffle iron tilted. I did not want to use it, so I returned it. I would like to order another, but afraid it may be the same."
3,Much too small,"We have a two slice waffle maker and got this one to make more at a time for ur large family but it is barely bigger than our old one. I'll be returning it. It just isn't worth fifty dollars for the small size. Other than the size, it looks fine. I like the reversible plates."
2,Waffle Iron too small,"We own 5 Waffle Irons so when we make waffles we can make 12 dozen or more and freeze them. This Waffle Iron appeared to look like the one we had received for a wedding gift 36 years ago, so we ordered it. It is similar, however makes a much smaller waffle than the first one we had. Still looking for a waffle Iron with a larger waffle. I have to eat 2 and a half for breakfast instead of just two. We pop them in the toaster for a delicious, nutritious breakfast on the go. We make them out of Oats and Soy. Delicious!"
4,traditional waffle maker,"We like a waffle maker that has shallow depressions rather than the modern ""Belgian"" waffles that are really deep. The Black and Decker does a good job, but they cook a little unevenly. I don't know if that's because of our recipe or just the way it is. We returned 2 or 3 other waffle makers before finding an exact replica of our old one, and going with it.Sunday mornings just aren't the same without waffles!"
2,"Starts off good, but doesn't last","After a little over 1 1/2 yrs of sporadic use, the grill side can only works on one side, the other is too cool to cook pancakes. The waffle iron's nonstick surface is not really nonstick. The squares in the iron are so small cleaning up after the waffle sides stuck together is a chore. I wouldn't buy this again! The Black & Decker brand gets a Black eye from this product."
5,A Million Uses!,"My mom used this when I was little- I remember loving it when she pulled it out. That meant something yummy was coming! I got this one about two weeks ago, and I couldn't be happier with it. I've used it 5 or 6 times a week- pancakes and waffles are soooooo easy, and I can ""customize"" the recipes (whole wheat apple cinnamon waffles and strawberry pancakes are amazing!). As long as you remember to keep the griddle sprayed with a (very) little oil or cooking spray, you'll have no problems. And it does get hot, so be careful when you're using it. I'm making a list of people who will be getting this for Christmas!"
1,What am I doing wrong?,"I have been extremely frustrated with this waffle maker, and I have finally decided to get rid of it after several failed attempts. I cannot get the waffles to not stick. At first I was using Pam. Then I tried greasing both sides with oil with a pastry brush, per another reviewer, and still no luck. The waffle rips apart every time, and then I'm stuck with a big mess. Not how I want to spend a Saturday morning."
2,It's okay,"I bought this because my mother had one when I was growing up. I liked it for a while and made lots of waffles. I have also used the griddle side for many things. Lately when I have tried to use the waffle side, the waffles stick to the plates and tear apart and I spend more time trying to scrape all the junk off rather than enjoying waffles. If you're interested in waffles, look somewhere else."
2,It's PEELING!,"Beware this product might come to you the way it came to me, with a non-stick surface peeling off. It also took a long time to heat up and made much denser waffles than I usually like. We ended up going back to the smaller but much better quality Cuisinart waffle maker."
3,Gr8 Griddle but not so great waffles,"I purchased it a month ago and when I bake waffles, they seemed to be squeezed thin with the heavy top same happens with french toast...It might be a feature but somehow I dont like them all hammered :)"
4,Works for all our needs!,"This items works as well as the one I have had for some 30 to 35 years.My only complaint is that it is not as heavily made. I should be happy about that as it is easier to store, but I liked the solidness of my previous one."
2,Waffles Baker,I am not very impressed with this product.It is very light weight and cooks very unevenly.The single heating coil does not do the trick.This seemed to get good reviews and I am not pleased.
2,Not that happy...,"After reading all the reviews, I purchased this waffle maker to replace our broken Cuisinart Round which we were very happy with. I was enticed by the larger size and multi-purpose. Upon using, I was very unhappy with the product. The waffles take forever too cook, are hard to pour and get out due to the square size, and worst - come out flat as a pancake. I'm not looking for a belgium style but I'd more than an Eggo.Worse yet, when I went to return it, I realized it was sold through a ""amazon partner"" OK-Sales. They don't post the return policy and guess what - no returns! Lovely - I bought this based on the fact that I could return it if I don't like it and OK-Sales refused to return unless it was broken. Sigh..."
5,"Yum, Yum Waffles","This is a GREAT waffle iron! We love that it makes the ""classic"" style waffles. We started with the Toastmaster 2 slice waffle iron, but quickly found out that with a family of 6 it was taking FOREVER!!! This waffle iron cooks our waffles (we mill our own flour) in about 6 minutes and they are Yuuummmy! My kids are always asking for waffles for breakfast and I am happy to oblige! We now operate both and we are eating in less than 15 minutes! SUPER easy to clean thanks to the removable plates -- these really are a MUST have! I've never attempted to touch the top of the grill during cooking, but from the other reviewers, I know that it would be foolish to do so. Anyway, if you are looking for a great, no frills waffle iron that gets the job done and one that you KNOW can be properly cleaned, this is the one for you! Hope this is helpful!"
4,Better than Belgian,"My old Broli King waffle iron finally gave up the ghost, and all the local stores had were those giant-hole ""Belgian"" style waffle makers, You know -- the ones that are really meant for making dessert, not breakfast. Broil King doesn't even make waffle irons anymore, this model looked like the small-hole kind, and my B&D; coffee pot held up pretty well, so I bought one.The unit worked great right out of the box; the only disappointment is that the waffles are slightly (about an inch on a side) smaller than those made by my old waffle iron. On the plus side, the griddle plates are easier to remove, and you can still flip them over to make pancakes, grilled cheese sandwiches, or Cuban-style ""pressed"" sandwiches (very trendy these days!).Overall a good product at an acceptable price."
2,not as good as expected,I was very disappointed with this wafflemaker. I had the same one for 15 yrs. This was very much lighter. It didn't heat the same on both sides. I called B&D. They said to cut off the cord and send it back to them and they would replace the appliance. This meant I would have to throw the wafflemaker in the trash. I didn't want to pollute the envirement so I sent it back for a refund. I wish there was another wafflemaker with the same features that worked as well as my old one.
3,from fairfield,Not exactly what I was expecting. I used a recipe from Cooks Illustrated but the waffles just were not what we had hoped for. I haven't used it for sandwiches... its not why I bought it.
4,Great Waffle maker,Overall great waffle maker. The only thing I thought was a little on the cheap side was the grill retaining clips.
4,Great product,"This is my first waffle can compare to others. It make 4 waffles at the same time, what can i say! Price is good. easy to use. no complaints!"
2,Doesn't work as a grill,"Makes OK waffles, but does not work well as a grill. I bought this because I liked the dual functionality, but when I tried to make pancakes on the grill side of the hot plates, I was very disappointed. It took FOREVER to cook the pancakes because the plates do not heat up quickly and they don't get hot enough, even with the setting on HIGH. Also, the plates are very loose and have fallen out while I was trying to remove a waffle that stuck to the grill."
4,Good little waffle maker,"OK it's not the best construction but it does a very good job at evenly and quickly cooking waffles. I have also had the sticking problem but I have found out that you cannot put the waffle plates in the dishwasher. If you do, the next time you use it the waffles will stick so badly they have to be picked out of the groves crumb by crumb. Instead just wipe clean with a paper towel, think of it as seasoning your waffle maker rather than 'not cleaning it'."
2,Great until it stopped working.,"Got the product out and plugged in then it turned itself off. Thought it was the automatic turn off, but the waffles weren't done and it won't turn back on. Thought black & decker was a brand to trust."
2,Too small,"From the pictures and comments, one would conclude that this makes waffles like Grandma made. Well Grandma typically had big families. I can't imagine her using such a small waffle iron. Also I expected something deeper, not as deep as Belgium waffles but a compromise from these tiny valleys and Belgium huge ones."
2,Don't buy it!,"I thought if I spent a little more money and bought a brand name I'd be getting a pretty good appliance. I thought wrong! As soon as I opened the box I was surprised by how chintzy the product is. Poorly designed, the top doesn't doesn't close well, the chord is too short and the heat control dial is made of the cheapest possible plastic that seems like it will break sooner rather than later. Finally it is hardly ""stick free"", you'll want to spray a little Pam on the plates. If you're looking for a good, trusty waffle iron that you will use for years, this isn't the one!"
3,Dissappointing,"After using this waffle maker for about a year now, I'm looking for a replacement. It is inconsistent; sometimes well done, sometimes underdone, occasionally over done. It is also slow. Now the clips that hold the griddles in place take some fiddling to be sure the griddles are locked into place."
1,Poorly Made Product,Black & Decker G48TD Grill and Waffle BakerThe first time I used this product the upper part of the waffle maker fell off. It is impossible to make waffles witht this product! I plan on returning it to buy a different machine by another company!!!!!!!! It is a waste of money though it is by a company that I thought was highly respected for its good products.
1,Black & Decker waffle maker,This waffle maker didn't perform well for us. The waffles didn't brown up even when kept on the griddle for twice the recommended time.
3,Medium happy,"I am medium happy with this product.Of course the space saving - Toaster and Grill in one device - is great. And I especially like the grilled Paninis we are making with the grill. The waffles have a great tendency to stick, even if I use a lot of oil.My biggest complaint is that the non-stick coating had bubbles, so even after 1 week of mild use and mild cleaning, we have pea-sized holes in the coating on the grilling-surface. Also, the handles become really hot, when the device is on and when you turn the plates to go from toaster to grill, you can see the innards of it and that the quality seems rather cheap.Still the price was ok and it performs it's functions well."
1,"Too Hot to Touch, Not Hot Enough for Great Waffles","If only this waffle iron would perform as well as it looks. The design is great: chrome finish, removable waffle iron surface. We were very excited about this product and have been nothing but disappointed.First, I burned the you know what out of myself the first time we used it. Other reviewers have said it before, the outside surface of this unit gets VERY hot!Second, waffles just don't turn out well. My old cheap [$$$]waffle iron used to turn out perfect, crisp waffles. With this one, they are always chewy. I don't believe the iron is hot enough to properly cook crisp delicious waffles. I would recommend staying away from this appliance."
1,Teflon coating was chipped right out of the box,What a piece of junk. It was chipped not only around the edges but also on the grid. I can't comment on it other than that as I did't even get to use it.
1,Sticks terribly and plates fall off!,I do NOT recommend this waffle iron. I had to get a replacement one because the waffles stuck on the plates on the first one so badly even though I seasoned it correctly. The second one is not much better in that department. The top plate constantly falls off when I try to open it. I burned my finger today when it fell off on me. The whole thing is loosely put together and is very wiggly/wobbly. The outside gets insanely hot. The top and bottom plates cook ar different rates too. The top will be dark brown and the bottom barely cooked. Overall a really crappy product.
5,waffle iron,"I was very surprised to find this item in the first place. I bought one over 30 years ago and it was in pretty shabby condition. Then I tried to buy a new one, all to no avail. They simply aren't in any stores I shop at. Then I thought of Amazon and there it was! I use it frequantly and just love it!"
2,"Good Name Brand, disappointed in how it worked","I had one that looked like this before and it quit working. Don't know what brand it was and when I saw this one, thought yes that should be worth the money. When I used it, it worked fine on the bottom but the top didn't cook even or even get hot enough. I thought with the cord going to top and bottom I wouldn't have this problem as I did with one of the 2 slice waffle irons. So, I guess you are taking a chance on it working properly. Very disappointed as I love waffles."
1,Poor quality.,"We thought that if we paid more for an item, the quality would be better. We were very very wrong."
5,the classic waffle iron plus,Love this traditional waffle maker. They are hard to find. This one is great quality and an updated model of the one we have had for 32 years. It is also a sandwich griddle - great bonus. The best part is that it cleans up perfectly.
1,A Poor and Dangerous Product,"This is the first review I've ever written about a product and I'm only doing so because my experience with this product was so bad.First off, the design is outright dangerous. I frequently suffered minor burns on the griddle when lifting it to remove my waffles as it's incredibly difficult to open it without touching the grill itself. If your batter is even slightly sticky, it becomes even more dangerous provided you can get it open at all. Often, the grill itself would come off its two flimsy hinges and present a whole new problem. On top of it all when it would work, it would take several minutes for a waffle to cook.Compared with the replacement waffler that we just purchased, I have a full understanding of how extraordinarily poor this waffler is and hope that no one has to endure what we did with this product."
2,Uneven heating,"The waffle maker takes a long time to heat up and does not heat evenly all across the grill. The waffles in the front half of the grill will be brown and crispy while the waffle in the rear half will be nearly white and soft.I just bought a Bella waffle maker and am surprised at not only how fast the waffle cooks, but how evenly too. This is the type of waffle maker that you flip over once you pour in the batter.I suggest buying one of these types instead of one like the Black and Decker that I won't use any more"
2,I wish I could be as positive as the other reviewers...,"unfortunately, I cant. My experience with this waffle maker was not so great. No matter what I tried to use to prevent sticking the waffles stuck to the waffle maker. It was worse if we added anything like strawberries to the mix. Additionally, when they would stick, the top of the waffle would separate from the bottom. It would be so stuck that I had to use a lot of force to open up the waffle maker and in doing so found my hand directly in the path of the steam coming out. Plus, 2 times the top plate came out of its hinges and almost fell on my hand."
2,Shoddy,"The waffle iron plates did not fit properly in the waffle iron, kept popping out while cooking, and those releasing the heat. The waffle irons themselves our shallow making thin waffles. Disappointing."
2,waffle maker blues,I bought this based on price and found it to be very poor quality in my view. The Cuisnart waffle maker that I bought at Macy's was more expensive ($50) but had the quality of a waffle maker that would last alot longer. I buy on cost not price alone. Cost is what will it cost me long run will I have to replace it in a short period of time and cost is what does it sell for up front with no thought about weather it will fall apart or not. Black and Decker has a pretty good name in tools but home appliances I am not so sure..
3,Not the old school waffle maker I thought I was getting,"I had to return this after using it just once. The plates weren't lining up properly and the bottom clip would not keep the plate on, keeping the heat from being uniform. This also seems to be made cheaply, with very thin chrome and other metal parts. I am now back to my original plan to find a true vintage waffle iron that works well. I would have rather paid $50 instead of $40 and had it be closer to what I wanted. This really wasn't even close."
4,Black & Decker G45TD Grill and Waffle Baker,"It cooks the waffles just right and they don't stick. However, it takes a long time to heat up. Eight minutes is much longer than I was used to with my old waffle iron. I do wish it had been designed to store upright as storing it as pictured takes up a lot of cupboard space."
2,"Waffles, not sandwiches","I have several Black and Decker products, but this one really disappointed me. It works fine for the waffles and I like the waffle timer. But you can forget the sandwiches. This product needs an adjustment made to the spring or either the sandwiches grids made deeper. My daughter used it first for grilled cheese sandwiches. Dissaster. The top of the grill is too heavy. The cheese melted all over the grids and the sandwiches were as flat as a pancake. I thought it was her that did something wrong. So I tried it; same thing, cheese melted all over the grids and bread flatter than pancakes. B&D has some good products; but, I don't know what happened here. I hope they can fix this problem. I would like to have a good old fashioned grilled cheese sandwich like my mother use to make. She had a good waffle and sandwich maker. Of course that was 50 years ago and I forget the manufacturer. I did return this with no problem. I hope B&D can rectify the problem. Thank You."
2,Disappointed...,"I was excited to find this waffle maker since it looked exactly like the one my parents used for 20 years. It worked great for a short while, then I noticed that one side of the griddle was not heating as fast as the other producing uneven pancakes and waffles! Now it's unusable all around. The waffles are sticking and burning no matter how much I season the plates and I can make 3 times as many pancakes on one side of the griddle as on the other because of the uneven heat! I'd like to say I'll buy another in hopes that I just got a bad appliance, but I'm not sure I want to risk throwing away the money."
2,Not as good as I remember,"It looks like the waffle maker that my mom used for all those wonderful breakfasts growing up. I've had the waffle maker for almost a year now, and after another disappointing round of waffles this weekend, I had to submit a review.I'd agree with other reviewers that the unit does not get hot enough. I've tried several different waffle recipes, including good ole mom's and each time the waffles are flat as pancakes and soft. I've given up trying to cook pancakes, even with the heat turned up full blast, they never brown.I've always been a fan of this type of waffle maker, but based on my experiences, I'll be looking for a Belgium waffle maker and stick with my stovetop griddle for pancakes."
1,Seriously Uneven Waffles,"We bought this because of all the good reviews, and because we liked the idea of the plates being removable and doubling as a griddle. We wanted something that could make more waffles at once, since our old Krups made only 2 belgians at a time, which doesn't keep our kids at the table. Unfortunately, the waffles that come out of this thing are consistently crisp on top and raw/mushy on the bottom. The top gets a LOT hotter than the bottom, evidently, despite the fact that we followed the manufacturers instructions to a ""T"". The waffles are totally not up to snuff. We're returning this and getting the Krups one that makes 4 belgians at a time, for $40. I'd rather have a product that does one thing and does it well, than one that does multiple things poorly."
5,"Reliable, attractive product","This is our second purchase of this same model over many years and have found it to be of good quality, reliable, and attractive square waffle maker. The removable cooking plates make clean up a snap and allows unit to be used for pancakes and sandwich cooking also. The temp control knob can be set to produce desired doneness everytime. I highly recommend this model."
1,Amazon Breaks Contract,"I ordered this on 12.18.09, with 2 day shipping, and it never arrived. Out of stock now from Amazon, or at least a 3-5 week backlog. Now I have no present for my wife on Christmas morning. Thank you very much, Amazon."
1,China Junk,"Black and Decker used to be good. Their products were well designed and quality built. This product supports ""not any more"". The product is cheap and flimsey. I didn't even bother to plug it in. I contacted Amazon who graciously took the item back. Forunately B & D has not messed with DeWalt, Porter Cable and Delta too much eventhough my Delta hybrid saw did have some problems upon delivery.I had to give the product a star (system requirement) eventhough it doesn't deserve one."
5,Waffle/Grill Excellent!,We were excited to receive our Black and Decker Grill and Waffle Baker just before Christmas. Enjoying waffles or grilled cheese sandwiches with our family was just too fun. We love our B&D!!
4,My review of the Black and Decker waffle maker,I bought this product as a Christmas present for my son-in-law and my two granddaughters (4 and 1). They love it! My son-in-law uses it to make waffles for the girls 2 to 4 times per week. The girls love the waffles and my son-in-law loves making them.
5,Great Grill,"I had an older one of these years ago and loved it. Tried several others and none compared so I kept looking, and finally found, a new one. I like being able to grill or make waffles on the same grill."
5,Have been very happy with this,We bought this about a year ago and were very happy with it. The biggest advantage to this one is that the sides come out and can be put into a dishwasher.
3,Bkack & Decker Waffle Iron,"Ordering and shipping were excellent. [...] came thru again. The waffle iron was as we expected it to be, utilitarian, however, we followed the instructions to coat the waffle plates with cooking oil the first use/ This was to enable the non-stick surface to be prepped. After the first time, the waffles still stuck to the surface when the cooking oil wasn't used. This wasn't supposed to happen."
3,thin waffles,"I purchased this product in substitution of my separate sandwich and waffle makers. The waffles come out consistently thin regardless of the recepie I use for the batter. Since I use it more often for sandwich making it's OK, but if you are looking for a good waffle, stay clear of this product."
4,Great Waffle Maker for the Money,"I bought this item for my mom as she has been using a Sunbeam she bought 30 years ago or so. This waffle maker creates excellents waffles. Even cooking, golden brown, crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. The only negatives I would say are first, it is not as big as I had hoped or expected it to be for a ""Four Waffle"" maker (the box is somewhat deceivingly larger too) and secondly, the latch is a little wimpy when you close it, but it's heavy enough that it cooks the ""top"" well. It did not bother my mom and maybe it was just a mistake, but it came with no instructions at all. However, if you don't know how to use a waffle maker, you probably shouldn't even be reading this review. :-)"
4,It reminds me of my childhood,I bought this as an item which I had on my list of must haves. It appears just like the one my mom used when I was younger and it was a great price compared to others I viewed. It looks just like the picture.
2,you get what you pay for,"I bought this waffle iron to replace one I've had for thirty years, not because it didn't work, but because it was looking a bit grungy thanks to years of baked on cooking spray. The new one was nice and shiney, but the iron grids were barely half as thick as my old iron. Waffles stick to teflon, prepped or not. They really should advise a maximum amount of waffle mix that should be used because spillover is very common and hard to remove once baked on. I will continue to use my thirty year old model and put this one in a furnished rental unit. Such shiney appliances always impress renters. By the way, if you want good waffles, put your grids in a self-cleaning oven to bake off your teflon coating, leave your home for several hours (because the fumes are toxic), and you will have easy to clean, non-stick cast iron waffle grids to use for decades."
1,Unsafe,We got this off of our wedding registry and I can't believe how poorly it is made! The two flimsy clips that are supposed to keep the plates into place are a hazard. We didn't even get to use the thing! We were just putting it together to use it for the first time and the plates wouldn't stay in place. I can't imagine trying to actually cook with it. The super hot plates falling out and burning you or something in your kitchen. No thanks. We will return it for a sturdier and safer waffle maker. What a piece of junk.
4,Decent for the price!,"I like waffles, this machine does a decent job making them. The grill portion works as well for sandwiches, as long as they're not to thick.Caution, the metal top gets very hot."
2,"Great idea, bad execution","This was a fantastic idea: a waffle maker and a sandwich press all in one. Unfortunately it fails to do either especially well.The Pros:* compact machine, all in one.* removable plates make for easy cleanup.* inexpensiveThe Cons:* cheap construction* thin metal gets **VERY HOT** to the touch. much hotter than you'd expect a kitchen appliance to get.* produces inconsistently done waffles,* waffles stick badly, even when using oil.Conclusion* after taking 10 minutes to scrape the remains of the second ruined waffle off the plates this morning, and burning my finger badly in the process, the singular moment of joy this machine brought me was smashing it to pieces on the driveway."
2,Poor waffle quality,"While this device may be useful as a grill it is a very poor waffle iron. In addition to producing waffles that rise poorly (perhaps a result of the weight of the upper assembly) the heating is extremely uneven. That, of course, results in very uneven browning. That is a show-stopper for me and after making 6 or 7 batches over a period of about 3 months, we have replaced the device.Perhaps the heating was a fault in this particular iron, but the smushed waffles can't be(Note: I have used the same, exact recipe for many years and with several waffle irons without this problem). The fact that the non-stick surface worked well for the brief time we have used this iron is of little consequence.A waste of good money."
2,Disappointing product,"I looked everywhere for a waffle iron and a griddle, all in one. I finally ended up getting this one because I thought it looked like what I wanted. I had previously owned a waffle iron and griddle for over 25 years. Unfortunately, the electric cord frayed and I thought it might be a fire hazard and I threw it out. In retrospect, I think I should have had a new cord put on and kept it. Washing it for the first time, I see a bit of the nonstick coating is coming off. I used the waffle side of it, and the thickness of the waffles is thin, much like the type one buys premade in the freezer aisle. It is impossible to adjust the color. The waffles come out splotchy: dark on some parts and very light colored on others, which makes me think it is unevenly cooking. If I had my druthers, I'd return it and keep looking."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!,"My kids bought this for their Mother for Christmas. Never made good waffles and the light and heating element went bad after 6 uses. Black and Decker will fix it if you send it to them, but the shipping cost didn't make it worth it. Try another brand."
3,A little disappointed,"I purchased this B&D Traditional waffle maker to replace our eight-year-old Toastmaster waffle maker after it broke. Over the past 25 years we have always had a traditional waffle maker and this is the first time that I have experienced the most uneven cooking pattern! The bottom front of the waffle browns more than the back and the entire top of the waffle barely browns. The heating elements do not distribute the heat evenly, causing the most unevenly cooked waffle I've ever seen. After a few uses I was hoping to see if the waffle plates would do a better job distributing the heat but that has not been the case. It is very difficult to find traditional waffle makers and this one has been a little disappointing."
1,Disappointed,"The waffles came out unevenly colored, some brown but mostly cream. The B&D recipe enclosed produces a waffle that is entirely hard similar to a Belgium waffle not uniformly brown crisp on the out side and soft on the inside like our old waffle unit produced. We tried our old ""tried and true"" recipe which was slightly better but not great. Would return but I bought it several months ago as a Christmas Gift. Very disappointed."
5,Great appliance,"This is the second Black and Decker Grill and waffle maker I've bought. The first one I had for about 12 years, using at least once a week. Very versatile with reversible grills. Great for grilled sandwiches, or opened flat for bacon , eggs and such. Searched until I found this one. Couldn't find in any retail stores."
5,Black & Decker G48TD Grill and Waffle Maker,I wanted an old fashioned waffle iron like the kind my mother had. Tried it out and it works great.
1,cheesy all the way,This seemed to be a good idea with the reversible heating surfaces and it might be if it had been done well. Everything about this machine is cheep and under engineered. The clips that hold the griddles in bend out of shape making it hard to lock them in place unless you bend them back. the lock that holds the top of the machine in the half open position so that the waffles can be removed is so lightly constructed that it will only hold the top open a few times before it no longer will. The machine could really use some rubber ends on the legs so that the machine would not tend to slide all over the table. And it would be really nice to have a ready light as well as a heating up light. This is a good idea that has gone bad do to cheep shoddy engineering and construction.
1,OK,"Last year I gave this 3 stars and wrote:'I like the reversible, removable plates. If it was heavier, and had bigger heating elements, and the plates locked in more securely, it would be better. Of course that would cost 2 or 3 times as much, but I think it would be worth it. Maybe they should make it both ways.'Less than a year later:I just threw the waffle maker in the garbage. We didn't use it much during the year we had it. The sample I had would not hold the top griddle in securely. Light weight, cheaply made, and a burn hazard."
1,Worst waffle maker I've ever owned.,"If you want waffles that rip in half every time you open the machine, then this is the product for you. Even if you coat the plates with Pam or some other no stick spray, the waffles always stick and rip apart when you open the machine.Even if you get the waffles to not stick, they still taste awful because the machine doesn't cook them evenly.Don't buy this Machine!"
1,Cheaply made and dangerous,"This is by far the worst kitchen appliance I have ever owned. The plates have a very small piece of bent metal that keep them attached to the heating elements. They are always popping loose in the middle of making waffles. This creates a very dangerous situation when the very hot top plate comes crashing off. Terrible product, buy something else."
4,Works great,"We followed the first time oiling that the manual mentions and since we always make waffles using the recipe on the Bisquick box, we never have to spray Pam or anything on the waffle iron when making waffles. I'm guessing that because the Bisquick recipe contains cooking oil, this plays a part. They pop right out of the waffle iron. We've found after the light goes out, the waffles need 5:30 to come out perfect. As others have mentioned, I too was a little worried at first with the overall construction of the waffle iron. But so far it's working great!"
1,It's not non-stick,The few times I have tried to use this waffle iron the waffles have stuck so bad that I had to soak and scrub them off. I just stuck the waffle iron in the closet out of frustration. I even oiled it before pouring the batter on to see if that would help. It didn't. I've never had such a bad waffle iron.
1,Poorly Made...don't waste your money!,"After looking for a new waffle iron and checking customer reviews, I purchased this one. Since it is a combination grill and waffle maker, I wanted to see how easy it was to switch the plates around. They were difficult to release from the clamps and I couldn't re-seat them once I got them out. Some of the components inside the unit underneath the plates had rust on them. Needless to say, I returned it right away and ordered a ""waffle iron"". If you want a grill, buy a grill. If you want a waffle iron, buy a waffle iron. Some combination units are more trouble than they're worth."
3,waffle maker,"I purchased this item based on the good reviews. It doesnt seem to be as sturdy as I expected and the top plate is quite loose.....it has fallen on my hand. Otherwise, the product performs as described."
1,"Poor quality, never worked right",We had high hopes as Cooks Illustrated magazine rated this waffle maker as their waffle maker of choice. We were disappointed. The waffle maker has removable cook plates on the top and bottom; one side is for waffles and the other for grilling. A small clip is supposed to hold the plates tight: it never worked. From the moment we opened the box we knew that it was poor design - the clip never held the bottom cook plate in place. We returned the waffle maker without ever using it.
4,The Best For The Least $,"Simply put, this is the best waffle maker, the most versital and easyest to clean up for the least money !!! I've read some of the other reviews, about the non stick coming off, but if you are carefull and gental, it will last for a long time, as goes with everthing these days. All in all a great product for the money"
2,Issues,We have had issues with the waffle iron feature in that the waffle separates in the middle and separates by sticking to the top and bottom. We made multiple adjustments to the batter and always oil each side well. Poorly designed in that steam burns your hand when you hold the handle to open the lid.Looking for a new waffle iron.
2,Flimsy and DANGEROUS!!,"I bought this for my daughter after her ancient one fell apart. I expected this to be heavy duty like her old one was. It is very flimsy and the waffle iron plates FALL OUT! We checked to make sure they were installed correctly and then plugged it in. My husband went to put the batter in the iron and when he opened it, the top plate just fell out! Talk about dangerous! Luckily she has a tile countertop so it wasn't burned while we grabbed a hot pad to pick up the plate with. We cooled down the waffle iron, reset the plates...checked them and darned if it didn't happen again! We then bent the clips (our grandson really wanted waffles) and it stayed together. My daughter said it fell apart on them too. We will try it one more time, but it may be an item that gets returned! If you purchase this, don't plug it in until you have opened and closed the waffle iron a few times to make sure the upper plate doesn't fall out."
2,Not my Mama's waffle maker,"I have been using my Mom's waffle iron for the last 20 years (no exaggeration). I think it was almost as old as I am. The Teflon coating on the plates finally started peeling off, so it was time to replace it. We went with this waffle iron because it's the modern version of my old one. However, it did not compare to my old one. When I made waffles there were definite hot spots. The waffles were almost burned in some places and barely brown in others. I was so disappointed.That said, I called Grady's Online who is the vendor that was selling this through Amazon. The lady I spoke with was nice, pleasant, and helpful. When I explained what had happened she decided the waffle iron wasn't working correctly and has already sent me a new one. I haven't had a chance to try the new one yet, but i'll update this review if it's significantly different. But I wanted to give a shout out to Grady's Online customer service. They were great!!"
3,Cheap,This waffle maker is very cheaply made. It should only cost $19.99 rather than $39.99. I wish I knew that before I purchased. It seems to work fine though.
2,nonstick flakes off on everyus,grill side non stick flakes off on every use.too much hassle to return waffle side seems to holding up ok
4,No problem with waffles sticking,"I've had this waffle iron for over a year now and have never had a problem with waffles sticking. I just use the waffle side and never remove the plates. That's right, it never gets washed. Doesn't need to if all I am making is waffles. Wait 'til you hear this one-My mother had cookie sheets that she never washed(actually I think she still uses them). She baked cookies and buns on them and those pans are as black as can be. However, it doesn't affect the taste. Using soap causes things to stick. In the instructions it says not to use non stick spray to season. Did you know that non stick spray has water in it? My only complaint is the clips. I never remove the plates so I haven't had a problem but it does look as if they are rather flimsy and poorly designed. As far as it being scorching hot on the outside-It is made of metal people, of course it is going to get hot. Are we becoming a nation of wimps?"
1,"High Price, Low Quality","Have owned this item for over 2 years. The frame, grills and temperature control are of low quality. Just pick it up then ask yourself if the product seems solid and not tinny. The temperature is not accurate and you must close the unit for at least 1 minute between batter, otherwise both sides of your waffles will not be equal.We have never had to spray the pancake side with any non-stick spray as the Teflon has worked fine. But for waffles, right from the beginning spray was required. After 3 months a spray residue builds up and the waffles will not release. So we now have a small pancake grill but not a waffle iron. Of course made in China. Have since bought a large good quality pancake/sandwich grill from Cooks (JCP).I discovered this web sight because I am searching for a quality waffle iron since I want to toss this very low value product."
3,Christmas Gift,"I am giving this as a Christmas Gift, but arrived in good condition and fast.I will be able to give a better rating after Christmas."
5,Terrible product,"I have had this waffel maker for about 3 months. It is supposed to have non stick surfaces, but I never could get it to work without some kind of oil or spray. The first set of plates got so bad, that I called B & D and they sent me a new set of plates, which was nice, but today, the hinge that holds the halves together, and allows to load the waffel maker, broke, and is now very hard to use. I have been buying Black and Decker products for over 50 years, and this is the first one I have complained about. This is one of the worst products I have ever bought!!! It looks great, but dont buy it!"
2,It broke after using it once!,"I was excited to find a waffle iron that makes the same waffles I grew up eating. After using the stupid thing just once the rivet holding the handle on broke, now the handle just hangs there from the remaining rivet. I have a few other Black & Decker small appliances and have never experienced the quality issues this thing has."
5,G48TD Grill & Waffle Maker,Very happy with this product which was purchased as a gift for my 83 year young Aunt which she said that she sure will enjoy.
2,Non-stick is a myth,"We purchased this waffler/grill last year as a replacement for another similar item. Having faith in Black and Decker, we were confident it would meet our needs.First, the positive: I like the heating control on the front.But that is totally offset by the negative. In the five times we used it, we never got a satisfactory result. The waffles always stuck and had to be scraped off. We tried different heat setting and different levels of pre-treating the plates. Nothing worked. So as a waffler, it was useless.And as a grill (for pancakes), it was not much better. The pancakes still stuck. The only difference is that, because pancakes have a flat surface, we were able to get them off the plates will less product stuck to the grill.If you are going to cook bacon or some other type of pre-greased food, this is probably an okay product. But if your dream is trouble-free pancakes and waffles, look elsewhere."
2,great for about 6 months,"This item is great for about the first 6 months, then the clips will not hold the plates & becomes very dangerous ."
1,cheap materials and shoddy unsafe construction,"Black and Decker should stick to making tools! This waffle iron is constructed of very light materials that conveys the hi grill heat to the outside surfaces and handles--every surface is to hot to handle. My wife burned her fingers on what she thought was a plastic knob protruding from the corner of iron -- wrong, it was the grease spout that for some reason, probably cost saving, is the same color as the lid handle. The waffle iron has been put back in the box and being returned, before any one else gets burned!"
3,Watch it or you'll set off the smoke detectors,"We bought this one to upgrade from our previous waffle maker strictly because we wanted a bigger one. This waffle maker works fine and certainly met our objective of being ""bigger."" Unfortunately, the thing we miss most about our previous waffle maker is that this one lacks a beeper. It doesn't make any sort of sound to tell you the waffles are done cooking. So with the old waffle maker, my wife could put some in and sit down at the table to eat until it beeped, then she would get up to take that waffle out and put in a new one. With this waffle maker, she has to stand there watching it for the light to go off and keep the waffles from burning.On the positive side, because it's bigger she can get through the entire batch of waffle batter quicker and just sit down and enjoy them after they're all done."
4,"Waffle-tastic, but keep an eye out for the light","Recommended in an old Cooks Illustrated, this waffle maker has not disappointed after three years of use on a weekly basis. The design is nice, but yes, it is hot, so it's not something for the little kids to be messing with. The stainless metal is easy to clean but if waffle mix drops out the back of the machine it gunks up the hinges. The temperature dial is quite accurate at making waffles as crispy or as light as you would like. The only downside is the fact that there is no bell or sound that it makes when the waffles are done so you must pay attention to the light to see if it has gone out. I have made many a waffle which could have been used as drywall thanks to how utterly crisped it turned out because I forgot about the light, but, on the bright side, they have never turned black or burned. Thanks to it's dependability and durability, this maker deserves a spot in your kitchen."
5,Fabulous!,Just what I was looking for! Both my mom and I got one and we both love it! You won't be disappointed.
5,Very recomendable,"We are very satisfied, but it does not make Belgium waffles that we ordered.Makes great sandwitches. waffles quite thin but we still like all the other features. The Grill plates are very easy to remove & wash & replace.L J R."
3,A little disappointed,"I bought this to replace the same model that stopped working after many years of use. The new one doesn't heat as evenly as the old one -- the center is obviously a lot hotter than the outer edges. The grill looks the same as the old one but seems to be lighter and cheaper made. Still, if you want old fashioned waffles and not Belgian style, this might be the best option available."
4,Great!,"If you don't want belgin waffles (I didn't) then this is a great waffle maker. The waffles are cooked pretty evenly and are not super thick. I've only tried the grilling function once with so-so results. I don't really want it for that purpose, but decided to see if it works."
5,A favorite appliance,"I always had one of these when I was raising my kids. Somehow life changes left me without one and I went looking and couldn't find one. Eventually I did find one and got it. Just recently I gave my daughter one for her birthday. I like that it does 3 things and does them all well - griddle, waffle maker, sandwich maker. I like that the non-stick reversible plates are removable for cleaning. My daughter likes that they go in the dishwasher.I like that it works reliably and doesn't take up extra space."
2,Disappointing!,"My husband bought me this model to replace the 40 year old waffle iron that had been passed down by my Mom. After numerous attempts to make decent waffles with this iron, I have returned to using the old one. The waffle grills consistently fall out of the iron during use. The construction is flimsy, I would not recommend it!"
4,NICE!,"This is a classic, like they used to make when I was growing up. It makes nice sized regular sized waffles, crispy on the outside & fluffy on the inside. It is hard to find the old skool waffle makers from years past, most are belgium or of the smaller variety. I do not use the other plates since I already have a Cuisinart Griddler, just the waffle plates. the only downside is that the hinges on mine are a bit flimsy."
3,OK maker,Take out grills are easy to clean. Had some issues with waffles sticking though. Definitely needs oil brushing frequently to keep from sticky waffles.
3,don't make 'em like they used to!,"Black & Decker G48TD Grill and Waffle BakerThe wedding gift grill/wafflemaker of 48 years finally gave out. It's replacement was ordered on Amazon-a Black & Decker grill/waffle baker. I was soo looking forward to some weekend waffles until I unpacked the small appliance and noted abrasions on the waffle plates. I also noted that the plate going in the top or lid didn't click into place; it wobbles side to side, hence the scraping when it shifts. I call B & D Customer Service. The customer service rep suggested a new plate. When it came, and I put it in the lid, the new plate does the same thing. Conclusion, this appliance isn't manufactured very well. So, do I have a lemon, or are all B & D Grill/Waffle Bakers this poorly built?"
2,Metal casing gets too hot,"There is no insulation between the heated coil and the external metal casing, which means that the outside can get as hot as the cooking surface. This is great if you plan on making pancakes/eggs ON your waffle iron while you make waffles IN it (although I do not think that is the intended use). Do not buy this unless you trust yourself to never put a finger on the casing within two hours of cooking."
3,Waffle baker plus and minus,"I've found that the waffle grids are taking longer to 'season' than I had anticipated, trying several different approaches including using cooking spray, washing or not washing the grids, etc. We've had to dig out and dispose of the first round of waffles each time we've used it. The second round seems to come out just fine. The waffles are crisp and tasty. The advertising that I've found a bit misleading is that the unit can be stored upright. This was an important feature as we are quite limited in storage space. Either this information is just wrong or there has been a design change as there is no way this unit can be stored in any other fashion than flat. I find it hard to believe that with only four options (sides) I have not been intelligent enough to find which is the upright storage edge!"
3,B&D G48TD Not As Good As I Hoped,"I recently purchased the Black & Deckere G48TD based on many reviews I'd read by customers who had purchased and/or received one. My experience did not live up to what I read. The waffle setting did not get hot enough to make a crisp waffle. Next time I cranked it up beyond the waffle setting and still the center where the four waffles connect did not get as crispy as the outer edges. It appears to have uneven baking temperatures from the outside to the inside. Another quite disturbing thing to me is that it seems to cook the two side separately, thus creating a seam-like effect and the 2 halves come apart while you're eating them. Longer cooking did help this problem a bit. I've been disappointed in this product and am still searching for a really good waffle maker."
3,better at pancakes,"We've had trouble with the waffles sticking, plus it cooks slower than our other little waffle iron. We use the plates on their flat sides for pancakes and it works well for that, but I think the washing the plates makes it hard to keep the waffle side seasoned. Also, if you try to do a sandwich between the two plates, it had better be a skinny sandwich. There's not much room. I think I would have been better off to get a regular waffle iron and a pancake griddle separately."
1,what a waste!?!,"I was sooo disappointed with this waffle iron. It's the worst piece of garbage that I have ever purchased.And very poorly made. The waffles stuck to the iron (regardless of the amount of oil used). The bottom grill didn't get hot enough and the top grill got too hot?!? I assumed that it was just a defective iron, so I returned it and was sent a replacement. It too, gave me the same problems. I wasted so much batter on this piece of junk. I threw it in the trash. This product is a total waste of time and money. I would NOT recommend anyone to buy it."
1,Shoddy and Dangerous,"I never even had a chance to plug this in and try it out. The griddles don't seat securely, and the metal clips that are supposed to hold them in place are so cheap and flimsy that I couldn't open or close the lid without having the top griddle fall out. Very dangerous if it had been hot. How this waffle iron ever received good ratings and UL approval is puzzling."
3,Flimsy clips for the waffle plates,"I agree with the people who are having troubles with the flimsy clips that hold the waffle plates in place. I guess that some clips come from the factory slightly out of alignment, which makes them drop the upper plate. The clips ARE flimsy, but if you fiddle with them a bit, you can bend them and make them work well. This waffle iron is more cheaply constructed than older versions; someone is saving a few pennies. But you can make it work well if you keep an eye on those flimsy clips."
1,High expectations before buying,"Just like the one my mom used to have...except that it didn't perform like the one mom had. After searching quite a while for a waffle maker that would make enough for a family of four I found this one and thought the search was over. Boy was I wrong. I made waffles multiple times and except for one time they all stuck to the waffle maker. The next to last time that I tried to make waffles the maker was stuck so tight that it would not budge without being pried apart with pliers. Aside from sticking the plates were not held tightly in place (which was probably part of the problem), plastic (cheap) handles, and a surface that would get extremely hot. The only positive is that it made it about 20 feet on one throw. Black & Decker should stay in the garage and out of the kitchen!"
2,No stick got unstuck,"After about ten uses over six months, the teflon started flaking off and we had to stop using it. I'm sure it was our fault, somehow, with overheating it or some such nonsense - nevertheless I wouldn't buy this model again."
5,Basic Waffle Maker Works Great,"I don't know why it is so hard to find a basic waffle maker. Our 20-year old unit got so the waffles would stick. I wanted to find one just like the old one, except for the part about sticky waffles. The B&D unit turns out to be just like the old one, but with a grill that releases the waffles. I am pleased to find a basic waffle maker that does what it says. I like the fact that the grill plates release from the unit, so you can just place them in soapy water for cleanup. I like the fact that the light goes out, when the waffles are done. Bottom line: I recommend it."
4,Black & Decker G48TD Grill and Waffle Baker,The unit works well. The waffle light goes out when the waffles are doneso you don't burn them. The waffles are not as thick and crispy as the traditional belgian waffle makers.It makes a nice grill cheese or panini. Grill plates are removable for easy cleaning.
2,"Uneven heating, bad customer service","We've had the G48TD for over six months, using it weekly. We have never had a waffle come out with even browning. See our uploaded photo of a typical waffle. We chose the B&D because it was mid-priced and had some good reviews. Bad mistake. I contacted B&D, thinking perhaps we got a lemon. They said they had few complaints and we were out of warranty. No help at all. My advice--don't buy unless you want to gamble. If you buy and aren't happy, return it right away. Don't experiment with different settings, different recipes, etc. Just get rid of it."
2,Trying again.,"I am in the process of returning the waffle baker I received and replacing it with the same model. The clips which hold the cooking plates in place seem to be installed incorrectly so the plates are not secure. The product performs well but because the plates do not install firmly, the heating element is visible and I am afraid it might not be safe. Also, if a waffle sticks even slightly, the plates pull loose. I am looking forward to receiving the new baker as it is extremely useful in my rv, serving multiple purposes and taking up relatively little space. It turned out terrific grilled cheese sandwiches, much easier than in a skillet."
2,unsafe,"Good points:*The plates are easy to remove to wash.Poor points:*There is no click when the waffles or other items are done. You have to sit an watch the light. Our previous waffle iron made sound and had a light, so you could wash dishes or whatever while it was cooking. Now I'm concerned that everything will burn.*Because the plates are removeable, it is easy to get things into the electronics and hot heating elements.*The item gets much too hot on the outside. Our previous waffle iron got very warm, but this one was scalding on the case. My fingers missed the very small handle and now I have some singed finger tips. You can easily see what the problem is. Since the plates are removeable you see that the casing is too thin. I have taken other waffle irons apart with my kids at school to show them how it works. I have never seen a waffle iron or toaster with this thin a case."
2,Disappointing Waffle Maker,"I grew up with a Toastmaster waffle iron of this size (It's still in my Mom's cabinet). My wife and I were given a Toastmaster waffle iron as a wedding gift 30+ years ago and it still works, but the cord is frayed and the waffles are now tending to stick to the plates. So it was decided now is the time to up grade, the Black and Decker being the closest look-a-like. When it arrived I was very disappointed. Wattage is only 900W. The old Toastmaster had 1500W for this size. There are 2-square units ou there that have 900W. Plus the metal just seemed thin and flimsy. The clips holding the plates in seemed very light and bendable. So we sent it back! Would I recommend it to a friend? Absolutely not. I'm still looking for a quality replacement for the old Toastmaster."
2,"Good when new.... 6 months later, not so much.","It worked well for the first few months, as long as you were careful not to open it too quickly. If the waffles stick at all, the upper cooking surface snaps out of place when you open it ... and then you'd better have burn gel close by. I was careful not to clean with anything other than a nylon brush, but I just can not get the waffles to keep from sticking any more. I've tried preheating for 30 minutes, I've tried cooking spray, canola spray and recently I soaked both surfaces in oil to make sure they were completely drenched, prepared to ""discard"" the first oily waffle as recommended in the manual. It still stuck to the upper cooking surface. I love the size and the fact that it makes 4 toaster sized waffles (or used to). Luckily I still have my old single round waffle maker to go back to. As my kids pointed out, it was much faster to make them one at a time with no sticking no difficult clean up and no burns."
1,Big disappointment,"The outside surface gets extremely hot when in use, and, not aware of that, I burned my fingertips when I tried to move the unit while grilling (I guess I shouldn't have assumed it was cool to the touch as my old grill). The unit didn't work quite well when I tried to use it as a griddle - it was hard to adjust the surface temperature, and it took forever to make grilled-cheese sandwiches. The ""grill/waffle"" side is very hard to clean, and after only two times I've cleaned it with a nylon vegetable brush, the non-stick coating is gone in several places. Also, the manual says to ""use non-stick spray"" when making waffles. I really miss my cheap old waffle maker from Wal-Mart, which never needed any oil or spray. Bottom line - this grill is okay to cook some hot dogs, but if you want more, buy something else!"
2,Uneven cooking; very slow for waffles.,"There's an electric coil behind each waffle/griddle plate. But the coils really heat only the area near the front. In every batch, two waffles are perfect, and the other two are pale and and soggy. I did have success when I spread the batter on only the hot side, but that's not very practical. Also, the waffles take a very long time to cook -- 8 minutes or so, even on high heat.On the pro side, it's great to have removable cooking plates, for ease in cleaning. Plus, the hinge is designed to accomodate a range of thicknesses, whick is good if you're grilling a sandwich or if your waffle batter rises a lot."
2,"Poorly Designed, Cheap!!!","I ordered this waffle maker because I thought it would do double duty as both a waffle maker and a griddle (plus it was on sale for $36.) It arrived and when I unpacked it, the cooking grids fell out on the floor. I read several other reviews where people had the same problem. It is poorly designed. The outer case/shell is made of very thin sheet metal and the edges are not rolled and it has no lip for rigidity, so it bends easily and does not hold the cooking grids well.If you remove the cooking grids you can see the interior and how cheaply it is made. I am returning it today.I would recommend you buy a different waffle maker."
4,Pretty good,"I've had one of these since the mid 1980s (GE branded) and it was very reliable - there's very little to it, and the thing just worked really well. It took a spill off the counter and finally broke (the Teflon was starting to wear off too), so I got a new one (this Black & Decker one). This is 95% identical to the old one, though the build quality doesn't seem quite as nice. Is that good? If you've had one of these forever, this one will be comforting and familiar. If you've never had one of these, there are probably some better options. The metal finish of this one gets very hot while in use, so if you've got little kids you may want to look for something different."
1,The worst product I didn't own,I brought this waffle maker to use for Christmas. Even after using all kinds of oils and even Pam all the waffles stuck to the plates. The clips that lock the plates in place always came loose and you had to pry the plates apart. I tried everything and had to send it back.
1,Rickety,Very dissapointing. Poor design is obvious the minute you see it. You would probably not buy this if you saw it first in a store. I certainly would not have bought it had I seen it first.
1,Not Made Like They Used To Be,My family has owned this model of waffle maker for about as long as Black and Decker has been making them. I got one as recently as my 4 years ago and it worked great and is still working great. Unfortunately when we bought a vacation home and I purchased one we were very disappointed. When set at normal waffle levels it barely cooks the waffle. Even when you raise the heat to the top of the waffle setting it cooks unevenly. The front waffles are perfect or even over cooked and the back ones are soft and still raw. I would love to tell you that this is just an individual lemon but it's not. Over the last 8 months I have purchased and returned 6 of these waffle makers and all had the same problem with some being worse than others but all being bad. My family loves waffles (I mean really loves waffles!!) and we are so upset that Black and Decker has obviously decreased their quality and turned an excellent product into a piece of junk.
4,waffle maker and grill review,"I was looking for a combination waffle maker and grill with removal plates for easy cleaning and this item met these requirements at a reasonable price.I made waffles and they turned out great, crisp on the outside and soft and tender on the inside. The only downside is that it takes about 10 minutes to preheat the grill before using."
1,Horrible waffle iron,"Don't buy it. After the first couple of waffles no amount of oil can make it non stick. Also, the clips that hold the iron in place are horribly weak and unsafe. That combination results in either a ripped apart waffle when you open it, or the top iron staying attached to the waffle and since this thing gets so hot you have to wait about 20 minutes until you have to pry it open.Save your money and buy something else."
1,Disappointed,"We bought this waffle iron based on ""America's Test Kitchen"" review, which gave this ""iron"" top ratings. We bought it on-line because we could not find it sold locally.Our first waffle was ""excellent"", but the next one was slightly less done on the half near the hinges. The third and fourth ones from this batch were unevenly browned and changing the temp setting made no difference.We waited a week (for our weekend waffle treat) and thought we should give the ""iron"" a second chance. Total disappointment. By the fourth and final waffle of the day, it was completely ""white"" when the light went out, indicating it was done. This was on the highest temp setting. (Note: Made in China, of course) Never tried the ""Grill"" option.Bottom line: Returned for refund and are looking for a higher end product to purchase locally."
3,not what it used to be,"I bought this sometime ago (2yrs) to replace the one we lost in Hurricane Katrina that was my grandmothers. I had my eye on it for a while and the waffles came out great (at first). Then the thing started falling apart literaly. It used to happen to my mom's when we were kids so I figured maybe I put the plates in wrong or they needed to be tightened. No luck. Finally after much going back and forth with myself I threw it out. The waffles were always sticking (even when I used spray or butter). The plates kept falling out when opening, and the thing was just flimsy. I had a cheapy from walmart that I was buying this to replace because I wanted the waffles like when I was little. You may get them for a while with this but dont expect it to last more than a year with minimal use.I gave it three stars because it does make waffles like I used to remember it just doesnt last long."
4,Good Waffle Maker,"My husband insisted on getting a waffle maker that had removable plates. The list is not that long. The waffles cook well, although I haven't tried it as a griddle or grill yet."
3,Great but.,"Could be hotter,could have a timer and could have better Teflon coating,the teflon is its weakness."
4,Good waffle maker / sandwich grill at great price,"I am a coniseur of waffles and this grill makes a great one. It also serves well for making grilled sandwiches. My first one broke after 10 years of weekly use. So while not perfect, I did get a lot of use out of it. Price is reasonable too. Cooks Illustrated also rated this unit a good one for making waffels."
4,Black and Decker G48TD Grill and Waffle Baker,This product is great - I looked for several months to find this combination. This grill heats fast and we have enjoyed using it!
3,An OK waffle iron,"I think I prefer the quality of waffles made on my old waffle iron which makes individual round waffles. Purchased this one thinking I could make more waffles in less time but I'm not too happy with the results. Waffles tend to brown too much and come out a bit too thin for my liking. On the plus side, it's very easy to use and cleans up nicely. Have yet to try it as sandwich grille."
3,Worked great til washed,"I loved it until I washed it. Now, even with a good amount of cooking spray, the waffles stick."
3,"Decent waffles, but slow","We have had this waffle iron for almost 10 years, and I think my mom had one just like this one. They do a decent job, but they are so slow. We have 4 kids who all love waffles, so it takes all morning to feed them."
1,Non-stick surface didn't last long,"After five uses, the waffles stuck to iron. It appears that the non-stick surface didn't hold its coating. Since it was outside the warranty, I called Black & Decker to see if I could get replacement non-stick plates. They offered them to me for $85 with shipping. When I informed them that I can get the entire waffle iron for $39 at Amazon, the representative asked me if I wanted him to check if he could get a lower price. When he came back he offered the set of plates for $65.I ignored the one-star reviews that complained about the coating. I thought if it happened, it would happen right away. It's trash now and I can't imagine I'll be buying a Black & Decker product again."
5,Great waffle iron,"I owned a similar waffle iron/grill many years ago and got excellent use out of it for years. It's replacement (a different kind) lasted only half as long. I now have grandkids instead of the 3 kids I had with that first waffle iron, which means the new one will get less use. It works wonderfully, and I expect it will last a long time. I like that I can select how ""done"" I want the waffles. It's also great that I can make several grilled sandwiches at the same time. Buying through Amazon was easy."
3,problems with wafles sticking,"The waffles turned out fine, but I had some problems with them sticking and then tearing apart. I followed their suggestion to use oil on the plates and not non-stick spray which would cause a build up. That happened to my Cuisinart. Over time a build up occurred. The waffles that didn't stick turned out fine. I like that you can remove the plates to wash."
4,Black & Decker Waffle Iron and Grill,"The waffle iron takes a while to warm up, but does make good waffles. We found that the Wal-Mart brand of waffle mix works best. We haven't had a need to use the grill option yet. This was the best price that I could find for this waffle maker."
5,Love this Iron!,"I had to buy a new waffle iron because my grandson can never eat wheat again. My old one was ""contaminated"" from past uses with wheat products. I am so happy with this one-it makes large fluffy waffles that do not stick and the plates pop out for easy cleaning!!! I can't wait for mornings that have extra time so I can make more!"
4,Black and Decker G48TD Waffle Maker and Grill,I like the tempature control as well as the better than average nonstick coating.The last 3 waffle irons I bought and returned!either burnt the waffles because they had no temp control or they stuck to the iron because of poor nonstick coating.Also you can use this as a griddle for toasted cheese sandwhiches.The only downside is that before I purchased this appliance I read reviews that the top of the griddle can get very hot which it does.Use caution when lifting the lid as it can seriously burn you if not careful.
5,Works just fine for me!,"This product does exactly what I expected it to do. Makes great waffles...which is what I use it mostly for. I've used it once to make a grilled ham and cheese sandwich and it worked fine for that, as well. The way the grill folds open 180 degrees is unique, in my opinion, and I can see how it could be used as two separate grilling surfaces...such as for frying eggs and bacon. Not yet tried it that way, however.I highly recommend."
4,Great waffle maker,"Nice unit. Non-stick surface is great, no sticking waffles. The higher waffle setting is the best. Waffle done light is accurate. Wish it had belgium waffle attachments."
1,I had to return it,This product was too small for my family's use. Also the heating was uneven. The top plate was hotter than the bottom one and food was burned on the top and not done on the bottom.
4,Waffle maker,"For the money, it's a good product. This Black & Decker grill and waffle maker delivers as advertised. The only concern for me, the instruction booklet stated not to place the removable waffle / grill sections into the dish washer"
1,Poorly designed,This is the biggest piece of crap ever. The plates will not stay in place. One small piece of bendable metal is the only thing that is keeping the plates in place. That metal clamp fails repeatedly. A waste of money.
2,Great...as long as it worked.,"Unfortunately, we have had the same experience as many of the other reviewers. After we used this waffle maker only twice, the plates would no longer stay attached. The metal clips are flimsy and do not hold the plates in place. The heat warps the thin chrome, and the plates do not stay attached or aligned with each other. I even had a hard time repackaging the waffle maker to return it. It would only stay closed as long as I held the top and bottom parts together with my hand. But each time I tried to put it in the box, a plate would snap off inside, making the top of the appliance spring up.I'm surprised by the overwhelmingly positive reviews for this appliance (I would guess that many of those reviews refer to an earlier, better quality incarnation of this product). I wish I had paid more attention to the negative ones before purchasing."
2,Cheap Made,This is cheaply made and put together. When opening it up the top griddle falls out because the latches are cheaply made and not installed correctly. Takes too long to cook also.Black & Decker G48TD Grill and Waffle Baker
5,love it,"Good product works great every time!Works just as described, and makes great tasting waffles!Shipped on time and intact."
3,It'll do,"I prefer my waffles crispier than this unit produces. Leaving the waffle in longer just results in darker, still not crispy waffles. I'm not all that impressed, but also not willing to spend $100 on a waffle maker. It'll do."
3,Black and Decker waffle baker,The reviews that I ignored were right- the top plate does fall out when you lift the cover. I made sure they were in correctly but the latch that holds the top plate in is too close to the bottom plate latch so it releases the latch.I'll just live with it and keep potholders ready to fix it each time. (and believe the reviews on future purchases)
2,tries to do too much,"Thought the 3 in 1 aspect would be nice: griddle, waffle iron, and sandwich press. But the appliance itself is kind of cheap and flimsy."
3,Stickiest 'non stick' ever.,"Maybe we need to get used to this waffle iron but we didn't have much luck the first usage. Had to throw away the first waffle....the next one was ""just ok"". Hate to use Pam on a non-stick surface but had no choice. Can't decide whether this will work for us or not."
5,Just like Mother use to have!,"But much easier to clean! The dual plates (waffle on one side, griddle on the other) are so handy. I find that I'm using it every day. The plates pop out and can be washed in the sink. Better quality black non stick than the usual cheap black stuff. I recommend you follow the directions for seasoning, and you'll have no problems. It has a temperature knob, but the directions say to cook everything on high except for the waffles-? One caution, pay attention to who you're buying it from. I thought I was getting it from Amazon, but at some point I was directed to a site called best D buy and they charged me $10 more than the Amazon site. But even at the higher price, I love this thing. It has replaced three appliances."
2,Not great,"This waffle maker started out okay, but I've had it about one year and I don't like it. The waffles always stick to the bottom or the top making it almost impossible to get them out when cooked. Lately, I've had waffles that are more cooked on one side, so it's not working probably. Lastly, the plates get very hot and so does the outside and I've burned myself twice on this applicance. Both burns were very painful. I'm currently shopping for a new waffle maker."
5,Just as good the second time around,This is my second Black & Decker Grill and Waffle Maker. The first I received about 32 years ago as a wedding shower gift and loved the maker. Unfortunately from use it gave out about ten years ago. A friend of mine had talked about wanting a waffle maker so I looked the Black & Decker up on the internet and purchased two and am really glad that I finally replaced the one I had received over 32 years ago. It makes great waffles and I love the grill as well. My friend has commented on liking it as well - when she talked about a waffle maker she didn't know they came with a griddle as well
4,Black and Decker Grill & Waffle baker,"I was looking for this and it's difficult to find in stores. Love it! It makes great waffles, pancakes, grill cheese, etc. I use it all the time. My biggest recommendation is to oil the grill instead of using spray. I used a paper towel to wipe off excess. Nothing and I mean nothing sticks. It is a bit flimsy so that's the reason for the 4 stars. I do wish the construction of this model were a little more sturdy."
1,never received item,"Even thought the website indicated that the item was in stock, it turned out that it wasn't so I never received the item."
1,Don't bother trying this!,"The first one wouldn't get hot and one of the griddles wouldn't latch into to place on the second one.Didn't waste my time or Amazon's trying a third one, nor will I ever buy anything else with Black and Decker's name on it."
3,Not the best but it does the job,I purchased this waffel baker several weeks ago. Seems like this style has been around for ever. I like the removable plates. The outside surface of this baker gets very hot so Be Careful! Construction is pretty cheap and flimsy. Overall I feel the unit was overpriced for what it is. Seems like I could have bought it at Wal-Mart for $19.00 not $50.00 which is what I paid on Amazon. It does bake waffels is the best I can say for it.
1,Appliance lacks quality,"Unfortunately, I gave my 35 year old combo waffle/pancake appliance to the Goodwill. It was still working. If I could find it I'd buy it back!I've struggled with the Black and Decker model and gave it away. It is very flimsy and dangerous to use because of the instbility of the irons, and the collection of grease in the edges of the waffle irons.I've searched everywhere for another model. I'm waiting for a manufacturer who will give us what we need.A. Snyder"
4,It gets the job done..,"One side doesn't heat up as fast, and the heavy steel plates keep falling off so it's difficult to make waffles.. works nice as an indoor grill!"
5,Got What I Wanted and Then Some,Wanted a grill because i love sandwiches and this is definitely worth the purchase. Warms up quick for fast use and works efficiently. I rarely make waffles but it's nice to have the option to flip the plates if i desire. Warning: Don't touch the metal part when in use because it gets extremely hot
3,Good waffles....but not without side effects!,"I liked the idea of the 2 in 1 with this waffle maker. But the CONCEPT was BETTER THAN the REALITY. Even though it clames to be non stick we have had some problems with this. There is a very fine line between to much oil and not enough. If your WAFFLE STICKS, the TOP PLATE DETACHES, and it is quite a pain to get it appart (must use potholders and plastic spatula to pry open). Maybe ours is defective.If you manage to get the right amount of oil so it doesn't stick, but isn't to soft and oily, than you come out with a beautiful, crispy on the outside soft on the inside, waffle! Makes a pretty good grilled cheese also.Bottom line: IF you don't mind the hassle of the plate detaching, you are already a pro with waffle makers and you like grilled sandwiches....than this is the waffle maker for you!"
3,Waffle Iron,"We wanted a waffle iron with removal grids so they are easy to clean. this fills the bill. However, it is not as sturdy as those we had years and years ago. It does cook waffles and does have removeable grids, but try as we may we cannot get the waffles crispy enough; they come out kind of limp and soggy. Still taste good though."
2,Poor quality construction,"I received this product and was forced to return it immediately. The black, non-stick coating was peeling and flaking off of the cooking plates in the box. After inspecting it further, it appears to be poorly constructed. The plates are held in place with flimsy clips, and the hinge is very thin metal. I don't see it lasting through years of use. I had hoped for better quality, but I guess I'll have to keep looking."
1,We have had issues,"I wanted to love this waffle iron/griddle combo....but it hasn't worked out between us. While I love that it's big enough to make multiple pancakes or huge waffles (theoretically), or grilled cheese sandwiches at once, I have had several issues.First of all....to me, ""nonstick"" means food should not stick. Food DOES stick. Feel free to view my photo (appropriately captioned ""we have had issues"") of a very stuck waffle. Mamma wasn't happy that night.Second, the griddle gets so hot that the shortening we use bakes onto it permanently, making the surface tacky and gross. Even multiple trips through the dishwasher have failed to remove this residue.Third, this thing gets scary hot. I am afraid of it.This must have worked well for some people, based on the good reviews I read before purchasing, but I want my old waffle iron back....the one where I could actually get my waffles out to be able to eat them."
5,"Wonderful, versatile product",Great combo waffle iron and pancake griddle. Our last one performed wonderfully for over 20 years.
1,Non-stick coating flakes off,I didn't learn the first time! I bought two of these grills because I thought it was a fluke when the non-stick coating peeled off the first one. We were even more careful with the second one but had the same problem. When I called Black and Decker customer service to buy replacement grills I discovered the replacements cost $55.00 which is almost as much as a new appliance. I hate to throw away a perfectly good electrical appliance. So I won't be buying this particular device again!
1,Poorly designed product,"We've had this product for a couple years. The clips no long hold the plates in. Just imagine--pouring the batter, then trying to close the lid. If the top plate does stay in, it certainly will not stay clipped when the waffle is done and you try to lift the lid. Then you have a very hot mess.The only thing we use this for now is pancakes because we can keep both lids open so it does not fall apart. In my opinion, Black & Decker should recall this evil monster."
1,Black & Decker G48TD Grill and Waffle Baker,"There are 4 sections to the waffle baker. The 2 front sections bake the waffle very nicely, but the back 2 sections do bake very poorly. In order to bake the back 2 section, you have to leave the waffle in the baker causing the front 2 waffles to overcook. Very dissapointing."
2,"Decent waffle iron, poor griddle","Yes, this product does get very hot, but the instructions warn you of that. I didn't have the sticking problems making waffles that other reviewers had, but the non-stick coating on the griddle started flaking off the first time I used it, and every time since. Now I will no longer use the griddle. I don't want to eat non-stick coating along with my grilled cheese! This seems like a ridiculous design flaw, even for an inexpensive appliance."
4,Great value and great waffles,I read many of the 1-star reviews before purchasing but took a chance anyway. We have not had any problems with the plates staying in place and have used it both as a waffler and as a griddle. Its so nice to have American Waffles again and to be able to keep up with our 3 voracious kids. I do wish it had a cool touch exterior as our 2-waffle maker does. Compared to the other options this is an attractive appliance that does its job and for a fair price.
1,Awful,"Cheap, poor quality. Spring clip on front broke on second use, trays never stayed in place well, very easy to burn yourself on it, small. Threw it away within 2 weeks as it was unusable (clip broke and trays would not stay in contact with heating element)."
1,Do Not Buy This Product,"This is the worst small appliance I have ever owned in the almost 50 years I have been cooking. No matter how the waffle plates have been seasoned the waffles are impossible to get out. If the grids are over-saturated with oil to get them out, the waffles are inedible. Also, the plates fall out very easily and are not held well in the clamps."
1,Very Disappointing,I've had this appliance for several years and used it lightly (2x per month). The plates have never heated evenly - one side was always hotter than the other. Now it's so bad the waffles only get done on one side.
3,Waffles,"Overall, the waffle iron is almost identical to the one I bought 30 yrs ago. Works well except it cooks quicker on one side than the other. Not a deal breaker but not preferable. Much better than anything I found on the shelf at any of the box stores."
4,great traditional waffles,"So glad to be able to get this through Amazon. We have used this style waffle iron for about 25 years. I think this is our 4th. We realize the wiring at the hinge will go bad, as that has been the problem for all of out previous ones. I tried several ""belgium style"" waffle makers and we just didn't like those waffles. We like the smaller grid/hole patterns of the traditional waffles. We don't have any problem with the waffles getting stuck on irons. We like that the griddles are able to be flipped over and used to make grilled cheese sandwiches. This was a really great price for this product."
1,Piece of Junk,"This thing is cheap, light, and poorly made. Although it looks like an old fashioned waffle maker, don't be fooled, as it weighs about 1/10 of the old ones it is made to resemble. After using it 2-3 times the plates would not line up with each other, and no matter what we did with the cheap spring that is supposed to keep them in place the plates would just fall out. It's being sent back."
2,not really like mom used to have,This may look like mom's but it sure doesn't work like hers. It doesn't heat evenly. The outside gets very hot. The metal cover is very thin. I wouldn't buy it at any price. It does produce a waffle and for that it gets two stars.Update--I'd change my rating to 1 star. I replaced this with the Villa waffle iron. What an improvement!
2,Disappointing,"I bought this waffle maker to replace one just like it that had stopped heating the lower grill. This brand new one heats both grills unevenly. The side next to the hinge gets less heat than the side near the control. I can live with it, but am very disappointed that it does not work correctly."
2,Poor quality short lifespan,I bought this and the first thing that happened as the grills would not stay in place - particulary when you are cooking waffles - they fall onto each other causing burns etc. This thing is 5 months old and I'm buying a new waffle iron as this is junk. It is much better as something to make grilled cheese etc. but as a waffle iron - it stinks.
2,massively confused -- cook's illustrated steer me wrong??,"Half our kitchen is outfitted by appliances specifically recommended by the folks at Cooks Illustrated.I bought TWO of these waffle makers -- based entirely on Cook's Illustrated recommendation.We were replacing hand-me-down-from-mom round waffle maker from 1970 that would have been appropriate for Appolo 13 movie set. BUT.... it continues to work great even today.Enter new B&D; G48TD --- first impression: how on earth down uneven cooking/browning pass the test of any reputable org like Cooks Illustrated?? The cooking surface is four ""waffle squares"" -- the front half of iron cooks significantly HOTTER than back half.Granted, I have yet to pull our my Cook's Illustrated surface temp thermo (very cool.. BTW) but I can guarantee there's a reason all waffles from this appliance are unevenly cooked.Pretty lame in my opinion and makes me grumpy. -GA"
2,"Design is great, although nonstick is sticky","I have this waffle baker for some time now.I dont know if i done something wrong, but even when buttering the surface i cant make waffles without sticking it.Only way waffles can be done in this machine is that i use significant amounts of butter on both sides, killing the taste of my waffles, featured in Williams Sonoma Collection - Breakfast - as ""Buttermilk Waffles"".I also have a Salton Singles waffle maker, bought incredibly in 1991, works fine, needs buttering only the first time, making up to 25 waffles without needing to re-butter itAlso, I consider a health hazard using the bd waffle iron. Device does not fold in a safely manner, and steam comes from all sides of device. Hope this was helpful"
1,Don't waste your time and money,"I bought this because I thought it would be ""just like the waffle iron I grew up with"" and just like the one I have now that my grandmother gave me 15 years ago. Many reviewers lead me to believe this was true, so I took a chance and ordered it. The one I have now works, but you have to flip the waffles to get them evenly brown on both sides. First of all, the plates are not the cast iron like what I have now and they are smaller. The clips to hold the plates in are flimsy, I could easily see them bending or, worse yet, breaking off. The topper of them all, the clips don't hold the plates in securely. This is a cheap imitaion (made in China) of quality product that was made in America that apparently can not be purchased anymore. This is going back. I'll keep flipping."
2,Wish It Was Better Constructed,"I thought I finally found the perfect waffle maker - I don't want belgian waffles, I want the old fashioned thinner kind...and, this fit the bill. However, on making my 2nd batch of waffles, the plates fell off - poor construction, wish I had sprung for a better quality model :("
2,Too Small,"I checked this unit out at a Linen's & More store. It's only 8"" by 8"" instead of 10"" by 10"" like the they used to be made. Each waffle is a single serving. Pretty flimsy construction too."
2,sticky waffles,"This makes a great grilled cheese, but the waffles kept sticking, no matter what recipe I used. I went back to my older Belgian waffle maker."
1,Looks are the only thing going for it.,"Pretty much pure junk. VERY cheaply made and cooks inconsistently. The fit of the griddle plates is so poor that they usually fall out of place while preparing waffles. Obviously when the griddle is 400+ degrees this presents a bit of safety issue. Unfortunately I had to waste $40 to come to the conclusion that I shouldn't have gone cheap when purchasing a waffle maker. Oh well, you live and learn I suppose."
1,Very cheap quality,Horrible. I'm sending mine back. Too lightweight and cheep. The grill panels slipped out of the holders whenI opened my waffle. Don't waist your time and money on this one.
1,Poorly made grill,"Tried to replace a grill & waffle baker (by another mfg) that has served well for 40+ years. Unhappy with Black & Decker choice - cast iron plates are good, but fit grill body poorly. Body is cheaply made. Put the new grill/waffle plates into my 40+ year old grill and threw the new B&D grill & waffle baker body away."
2,waiting for waffles...,"I was very excited about finding this waffle maker. It reminded me of the one my mom used over 40 years ago & my memories of light fluffy waffles prompted me to buy it. It does looks great but it is very disappointing. The waffle iron takes over 15 minutes to warm up...a long time when you're trying to feed hungry impatient kids in the morning. It also neeeds to be oiled before every use or the waffles will stick to the iron. They stick sometimes anyway & it is maddening to wait and wait to see that red light go off only to find the waffles split in two, stubbornly clinging to both sides of the iron. There is no beep indicating when the iron is warmed up or when the waffles are done so you basically have to sit around & watch it like a hawk. I would return it but I got rid of the box. Look elsewhere for waffle happiness."
3,poor quality design & mfg.,"Our last waffle iron lasted 45+ years. Doubtful this one will last 4-5 years. Griddle retention tabs flimsey. Cal-Rod heating unit doesn't heat evenly on lower left-hand rear quarter segment, waffle much lighter in color in this area. Temperature adjustment knob/shaft has almost zero resistance when setting to the desired position. Disappointed, as the Amazon write-up made it appear as everything we were looking for. If I had seen this product in a store, and checked it out, I would not have purchased."
1,Didn't fit My car.,"If you have a 2008 Kia Rio5 this will not fit your car. I bought this item because the page said that it would fit my car. After it arrived and I tried installing it, it became very apparent that it would never fit my car. The return process was easy so it was not the worst thing ever, just a big let down that it wouldn't fit. I ended up just going to U-Haul and buying one from them and having them install it. The hitch I ended up with from U-Haul looks closer toCURT Manufacturing 110920 Class 1 Trailer Hitch Only. If you are looking for a hitch for a car like mine or one close to it, I suggest buying the one I linked."
3,Not a new item/Rude Customer Service,"Reason for purchasing:First one failed after about 6 months and this was a pretty cheap watch to replace.Not New:Item did not appear new, it appeared the item had been returned by someone else then sent to us as a ""new item"". The watch was taped to the stand with scotch tape and everything practically fell a part. The box inner box and watch were just stuffed in the show/retail box.Customer Service:Contacted the number, well tried to contact customer support. They are only open between certain hours and did not return our first 2 voice messages. The third time we called we got a person who just kept repeating well does it work, and there is nothing I can do about it. Finally after about 30 minutes on the phone she said we can send the watch back and after they get the item back they would send another which would take about 2-4 weeks.Final Thoughts:I will not buy a third watch from this company."
4,good watch for elderly,I bought this watch for my father in law who needs to take medication 3-4 times a day. It really helps him remember but I wish it vibrated as well cause he has hearing difficulties. It does repeat the alarm time for one minute so he does hear it eventually. I would recommend this watch.
2,It does talk,I purchased this watch for my husband who is blind and needs reminders to take meds. The watch worked great for about 3 months. Could not beat performance or volume. After 3 months the watch kept reseting all alarms to factory and turned all alarms on. Even after replacing the battery the problem still remained. I am going to try another one just incase this one was bad. The price makes that doable and my husband loves it. I will also buy a different watch just in case.

3,My comment,To be honest this product only satisfied my needs at a minimum level.I do advise it in case of lacking any other good dictionaries regarding Arabic-English business words
2,Apple iBook G4,I purchased the Apple iBook G4 and was disappointed when I received it. The screen had a small crack in the upper right corner and would not turn on even when charged for over an hour. Betamacs supplied me with a prepaid return label immediatley and I have returned the computer and I am waiting for a refund.
4,Review on IBook G4,I got a iBook G4 from beta macs an it was in ok shape the caps lock light doesnt work an the leds by the connetions is coming up an it was dirty but not much.
1,Don't Waste Your Money!!,I purchased this laptop in March 2011 as a birthday present for my son and it stopped working in August 2011. All of a sudden the screen stopped functioning. When I took the laptop to an apple store to get it diagnosed they advised it needed a new LCD and it would cost another couple hundred dollars. Betamacs will not do anything since it is past the 30 day warrenty period so in hindsight I should have put the $200 towards a new computer if I was going to wind up spending $500 anyway.
5,Greate buy,"I bought this maybe a month ago and i couldnt be happier. Everything works great and almost no scraches just some regular usage buffs on the bottom but other than that it clean. The screen is new the mouse button still clicks like it was new, keyboard is great condition, and it got here just on time. Although im not a mac user normaly this computer was awsome! I used it as mac for a while then installed linux, i am a linux user so yeah i had to do it, and i have had no problem, use it daily for projects and hangs in there with the intel computers just as fast but without using up alot of space like a regular laptop, so i can use it even on small tables."
5,Apple iBook G4,"Item was exactly as advertised. Very pleased with this purchase. Daughter and grandson have been without a computer since their last move, and this was just what they needed. Will definitely check back with this seller when husband gets ready to upgrade his computer."
3,Apple G4 LOVE IT,the mac is ok.... lot better condition i thought it was going to be in...it was a little dirty they could have cleaned it before they send it but it good after i got it clean it was coolthe mac does get a little hot... on the bottom and on the left side of the track pad..key board is the dirtyes thing on the item..the power plug does not work all the time not shur if it is the cord or the plug in area idkbatter hang out littlewhen computer boots it bring up a gray screen and then a world pops un then a ? and a mac sign and keep blinking like 15 times then goes to the apple symble.... and boots from there...
1,piece of crap broke already,"i gave it on christmas as a gift it already broke 1/3/12, child is now very unhappy and im out the money great way to do business"
2,Unhappy...so far.,"First off, I will say the customer service was helpful when I had to return my ibook G4 the first time. I had the ibook for about a week and attempted to download my first CD to itunes and the CD got stuck. I returned it and they quickly repaired the CD drive and it's worked fine since. About a week ago (i first received this ibook on 3/4/11), while surfing the web the computer screen will make a screeching sound and then freeze up. I also get the error message to restart the computer. I do, and it'll freeze up again...and again and again. Some times, it doesn't even make it to the desktop and it'll freeze up on me. Needless to say I'm pretty frustrated at this point. I'll be returning the ibook this week and hopefully they can fix or replace. I'll updated this review accordingly."
2,For the first time Mac user...but don't buy it,"Decent computer, for the price. Unfortunately, during shipping, the 'T' button ceased to function, so I pulled it out and pressed it with my finger and the button worked. Then, about a week after I got it, the whole thing shut down. Couldn't get it to start up again(trust me, it had good battery). Since it was so cheap, I just returned it and was refunded full price.(minus shipping, cheapskate)Don't buy it, just don't."
4,Looking for a good used mac,"I was looking for a basic and used Mac. Found exactly what I was looking for here. Not exactly the greatest condition, but then again it was exactly as advertised and exactly what I was wanting. Will def. buy from again."
3,Battery problems,"This Laptop is ok, I got in on time and everything. The reason it is only ok is because I'm having batteries troubles. The battery is not charging, so I have to keep it plugged in at all times. I'm trying different ways to get the mac to read the battery but it's not working. I might just have to but another battery off Amazon."
3,"It's what I wanted, BUT...","Since the last time I used Apple products things have changed. I was familiar with this one, but since I last encountered it there have been several issues with Flash Player and internet browsing. Still working on a fix. Product arrived quickly and in great condition."
4,Apple iBook,The computer works great. It is an old model and only has limited ability compared to the ones today but it still is high quality and performs well for what i do.
4,apple g4,gave it away as a gift it is alittle slow buy for the price and browsing the internet it serves its purpose
3,Maybe - Maybe Not,The iBook is usable but I don't think it was wifi ready as advertised. My grandson has to do a lot of restarts to get it to connect and it says it does not have an airport card. We have been able to get it to work well enough for him to get experience in the MAC world. I'm not sure OS10 was ever made for this old an iBook.
1,"zomg, again.","I'm with Peter on this one - the instrumentals for Cells were great, used in both Transporter 2 and Sin City. But the singing. Oh lord, kill me now, this has got to be some of the worst vocal stylings ever.And the lyrics are absolutely horrendous. The frontman sings about wanting to play video games (""I've got another level that I want to clear""), cooking (""we should be more adventurous with our meals""), eating (""we eat chinese off our knees""), and so forth. And that's only in the first VERSE of Cells. How the hell did such groovy music get such a horrible singer/writer? It's unbelievable. These guys are Britan's answer to garbage US bands like Hellogoodbye and Bowling For Soup.I don't really know how this band ever got a record contract... oh wait, guess the music industry is the same all over the world, nothing but trash.Apologies to anyone that thinks this music is actually good, but hey, you're wrong. Listen to it again and you'll realize it."
2,"If the singer was mute, this would be a good band.","It's already been said, but I feel compelled to emphasize the fact that this band has pretty decent music, though it's all but ruined by the singer's grating wails. I too first heard of The Servant via the Sin City trailer, and soon after listened to the whole song on The Servant website. I was... unimpressed to say the least, when I found that the vocals for Cells don't match up to the song at all. But, thankfully the band was kind enough to release an instrumental version of Cells on their website. I don't know if it's still up, but the password was ilovecells, and if it still works you can bypass any reason to ever need to buy this cd."
2,No wonder they removed the vocals in the trailer,The only reason I gave this two instead of one star is because the music is quite good... BUT the singer is TERRIBLE!!! I now know why Rodriquez did not use vocals in his trailer!!! This guy sounds like a dog that has been neutered without anesthesia!!! In other words he sounds just like the singer from Oasis... You get groving to the music then when he starts singing... Nails down the chalk board. I can't believe I wasted over $40.00 for this....

5,Addictive Music?,"I heard an instrumental version of ""Cells"" on the trailer for the upcoming movie ""Sin City"" and thought ""that's a pretty rockin' track"".. so I did a little research...So I found the band, and got the album... and I've very glad I did.The music is hard to discribe, kinda of a poppy, electronic, acoustic Our Lady Piece, with lyrics out of a Tenacious D song??? Not a dreadfully appealing discription, I'm sure, but very catchy melodies and lyrics that you want to sing real loud in the shower.Personal favorite off the CD is Cells, but it'd be hard to put any one track very high above another, they are all great, with no ""lemons"" or off songs in the lot.The cd's been in my car stereo since I got it, and it's a purchase I don't you'll regret."
5,The Wisdom of the Ages,"There is a reason why this book is still so popular after half a century: Robert Collier had a unique understanding of the world and how it works, and was the best ever at explaining it. This book answered questions that I'd not found answers to after many years of searching: Why doesn't my life work better? How do I know I am doing the right thing? Is there some way to remove the doubt I have about what I should be doing? How can I find my purpose in life? I only wish that Robert Collier could have met Jose Silva and written about the techniques that Mr. Silva developed... techniques that implement the things that Collier wrote about. They both understood... Jose Silva developed techniques, and Robert Collier helped us understand them. I hope everyone will read this book. Thank you."
4,GOOD ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE A COLLIER FAN,"RICHES WITHIN YOUR REACHGOOD ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE A COLLIER FANI purchased this book after reading several of Robert Collier's other books.I am happy with the purchase and think the material is great.The only reason that I can not give it 5 stars is that some of the information seems to be somewhat redundant and excerpts from his other books (not totally original) but overall it is well worth the time, BUT if you are new to Robert Collier you would probably do better with his Secret of the Ages book.This is a compilation of several of his books.Another incredibly good compilation is the 7 Motivational Greats which includes As a Man Thinketh and several others."
3,Great tunes - poor cd,"The title says it all, the quality of the sound on this CD is really bad for some reason. Apart from that it's all you would expect from DJ Onionz"
2,How the Gruber book changed my life,"I was unpleasantly surprised at my results with this book. I took the PSAT and received a score of 1470. I thought I really had a shot at getting a great SAT score, so I bought the Gruber book. After studying for months before the test with this book, I took the SAT and received a 1050! How could this be?! After that, my parents splurged and purchased the SAT1600 Encyclopedia for [$$$]. It was well worth it...I retook the test and got a 1590! Looks like the elite in the top 10-20% need not apply with this book."
2,"Fast, But Beware....","I was looking for a compact electric kettle because, as a tea drinker, I wanted HOT water FAST. (The microwave oven was very slow, even for my one-cup-at-a-time use.) I selected this one because of the ratings and because of its clean lines. One thing I did not anticipate, which is important to know if you intend to purchase this particular model --- the outside of this kettle gets HOT! If you touch any part of it (other than the handle) after the water has boiled, you will know it."
5,Better than a traditional water kettle!,"I like to get boiled water fast without the hassle of using a water kettle. Reasons as follows:1. You can forget the kettle while the water is being boiled. Even with a whistling type, I could still have forgotten given my morning rush to get to work (before the whistle starts). 2. This is a lazy excuse but I also don't like going back to the kitchen when the water is boiled to shut off the oven/range. With Capresso, you put it on and forget it (it shuts off automatically). A really nice convenience when I drink lots of tea and have to have hot water readily available."
4,Great Camcorder Rain Coat,"I have used other cheaper rain protectors including plastic bags. I am glad that I found this one on line with Amazon. This is doing exactly what I want it to do while filming outside sporting events(soccer, football, lacrosse, baseball and softball). I get maximum protection on the camcorder and have the ability to access all the electronic controls of my Sony FX7."
5,Saved Again!,"We do a travel television show entitled ""Another Shade of Blue with Ty Sawyer"" where we travel the world looking for adventures in water related locations. We follow Ty, a world famous photo-journalist both above and below the water as looks for the most authentic stories in each location. On our last show we went to Grand Cayman todo stories on the Kittiwake wreck and the lion fish invasion in the Caribbean. On one dive excursion the skies opened up and rained for over an hour but we had these Kata covers on both of our Sony HXR-NX5U cameras. We were soaked but the cameras were perfectly dry. As you can imagine being on boats and around the water all the time our cameras need to be protected and these Kata CRC-15's have served well over the years from rain to waterfalls to jet ski rooster tails our gear is always dry."
1,Mabel Dodge Luhan can speak for herself: The autobiography,"What an outrage and disappointment, this super organized, sanitized act of academic hubris by Rudnick. I suggest you compare this text with the real thing - Edge of Taos Desert to see what I mean. The ""Rudnick"" autobiography was a total waste of money. I don't think Mabel Dodge Luhan was the kind of woman who would have take kindly to being ""abridged."" Nor should she have been, when she wrote prose as compelling, honest, sensual and spiritual as found in Edge of Taos Desert. I hope to find an unabridged autobiography. Meanwhile I'm mailing this ""autobiography"" back to Rudnick."
4,Pleasant Holiday Diversion,"...While not a great one, it is a very pleasant holiday film. I've often wondered what a child's reaction to seeing it's mother kissing Santa would be and this story is one very amusing take on that idea. Granted some of the actions are over the top, but is does offer a child's eye view of such a situation. Plus it features the always lovely Connie Sellecca - that alone makes it worth having...."
4,Cute Family Movie,"I thought this was a cute holiday movie for the whole family. However, the child's character plays pranks on Santa throughout the movie. I think it's very important that the children who watch this know that his behavior was wrong. All of the trouble could have been avoided if the main character had just talked to his parents about the misunderstanding. But then there wouldn't have been a basis for the movie. Anyways, I think it's a good teaching opportunity for kids."
2,Santa go hoo hoo hoo home,This movie is not as good and it is not It's a Wonderful Life. It is about a boy that mistakes his father kssing his mom for Santa Clause kissing his mom. The movie starts with the main boy's family having Thanksgiving dinner with next door neigborrs and family and friends. Things are perfecto for the main child character (Cole & Dylan Sprouse) utnils he secretly listens in on his father (Corbin Bernsen) and his mother (Connie Spellecca) fighting over the house bills. Dad dresses as Santa Clause and the boy sees Santa CLause in his house and gets a pitcure of Santa Clause kissing his mom. So he turns to his best friend/bully to other kids & adults (Eric Jacobs). He tells him if he wants to scare Santa Clause he hads to be bad while his parents are about to get a dirvoce. Now if you want a much better christmas movie watch either How The Grinch Stole Christmas or It's a Wonderful Life.
1,The service sucks,"I have not received the merchandise. I received an email that said I may get it sometime in February. It's not like it was a very popular movie, so why the delay?"
3,Light And Frothy Christmas Comedy With Some Fun Moments,"Based on the famous Christmas song of the same name ""I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus"", is a pleasant festive diversion which is ideal to screen early in the Christmas season. While this 2001 television movie will never join the ranks of ""Miracle on 34th Street"", ""It's A Wonderful Life"", or 'White Christmas"", as a bona fide Christmas classic it does have many things to recommend it. Blessed with some interesting performances by the leads, a few hilarious pratfalls and slap stick sequences involving a very harrassed Santa Claus, and some of the most spectacular location photography you could ever imagine shot in a snow clad Utah this film makes entertaining but not classic festive viewing"
4,i saw mommy kissing santa clause.,"i think this is a very funny film and very good. it is good for kids to watch and i enjoyed it, especially at christmas."
1,Don't buy these!,"These are described as stainless steel, but they rusted dramatically after being washed once. They are so badly stained at this point, that we don't even use them. The only useful part of this product is the wooden storage tray, if you have other knives that will fit."
2,Misleading description,"Just received the set of knives I ordered. The product description is misleading. There are not made in France but rather in China. Also, 2 of the knives came bent."
1,Poor quality.. Bad condition..,"This item arrived in horrible condition. 3 of the knives had the tips broken off, 2 were slightly bent, and most of the handles (which were highly polished) had scuff/scratch marks on the middle as if they were thrown around excessively before packing (IE; this WASN'T a shipment issue, they HAD to be in this condition prior to being put in the package).Aside from that, the knives didn't really have a substantial or ""heavy"" feel in the hand, they were relatively small and sortof cheap looking. Very poor quality."
1,These knives are total junk,"All of the knives are bent with dirty mark everywhere, I can not believe they can carry the sabatier name for such quality..."
5,Beautiful look and feel,"These steak knives are absolutely beautiful, and a pleasure to use. Most steak knives are bulky with huge handles. These have slender handles, but just the right amoung of weight. They are exactly as long as the table knife in an oversize or European style flatware set. This knife looks great with stainless flatware, and some people might prefer to use the steak knife more often than or instead of the table knife. The knives are sharp and cut through meat easily, as you should expect. At this price, these knives are an incredible deal."
4,An addictive series,This is a great set for anyone who is interested in getting into a show that is both groundgreaking and highly addictive. Excellent plots and fascinating characters.
3,Ho-hum,"I got this knowing it was not John Denver and the Muppets: A Christmas Together. It was for my one year old who looooves the Muppet Show, so I figured he would like it. He does, but the video quality is pretty bad at times. I am not sure if that is due to the HD tv, or a similar problem, but it can be annoying to watch. Also, I think its a bit over-priced for the quality. The only reason I gave 3 stars is for the storyline; its cute and kid-friendly."
3,John Denver and the Muppets- Rocky Mountain Holiday,"Not the one I was expecting, I didn't know he did more than one muppets christmas special. It works great."
3,Muppets Go Camping,"The Dvd is a good Dvd to have if you enjoy seeing John Denver with the Muppets. He also did a Xmas Special.The order was placed as a new Dvd, however, the company that shipped this Dvd for Amazon sent (Dvd was saran wrapped with a sticker indicating it was new),a used Dvd. I opened the package and found a returned merchandise receipt inside dated Dec 6, 2003. New....I don't think so. So beware."
4,a walk down memory lane,"The video was in the wrong format for Australia but I quickly learned I could change the setting on my PC. It was great catching up with those crazy Muppets, where have they been all these years. I wish I had kids to share it with. Light entertainment for all the family with gorgoeus scenery and valid messages. Miss Piggy on horseback...I've seen everything now!! As a JD fan it was lovely to see a young, fresh faced John interacting with his good mates; and a nice touch was footage of him flying kites with his children. I loved it and would recommend it to all fans of John Denver, Muppets fans and families. Thanks Amazon for linking me to this little gem from my past."
5,Xmas Special,Sorry for those who thought this was the xmas special. that is coming in November. Other than that this is a great hour special.
3,Very disappointed,"It's my fault for assuming the title was changed, but I thought going in that this was the Christmas Special I remembered seeing as a kid, and found out the hard way after opening the DVD. If you're a fan of John Denver's country music and the muppets, then add a star to this DVD. If you really wanted ""John Denver & the Muppets: A Christmas Together,"" don't make the same mistake I did, and skip this one. Hopefully that will be released soon."
5,"John Denver and the Muppets, Rocky Mountain Holiday","This heartwarming video will be loved by all ages, and can be especially appreciated by those who have spent time out in nature. The Muppets are hilarious and it is obvious how much John Denver enjoyed making the movie. Good lessons are learned on the trip and fun is had by all, especially those watching the video. Get an extra copy of this one because your kids will wear it out."
5,Excellent!,"Excellent DVD Set. Season 4 of Melrose Place is really great. For everyone who is a fan of this amazing TV show, I definitely recommend purchasing this one."
4,Disc number one scratched on arrival and not secured in case,"I had waited and was worried from reading packaging issues on this. Wheni received item (very fast !) I was upset that I had same problem others had written about, season 4 disc one was scratched when i open the case it was not secured on the plastic nub it should have been sitting fiirmly in. I have never had a problem with Amazon, and have ordered for years from the company. it must be a manufacturer issue. please be warned. Now I have to go through a return process i am slightly uncomfortable with. The only good thing is that Amazon is a reputable organization and I hope I can get a replacement for the first disc of season 4 easily and as timely as the package came in the first place ."
4,action,More action. Hate theme song but rest of music was great. Packaging on first three sets were so much better. Should stick to what works.
5,BEST SHOW EVER!,I AM ADDICTED TO WATCHING MELROSE PLACE THIS SEASON WAS FILLED WITH PLENTY OF SUPRISES. CAN'T WAIT FOR SEASON 5!!
3,This show did not age well!,"Is it just me, or did Melrose Place seem ten times cooler a decade ago? This show is actually pretty cheesy, but at the time I thought it was pretty awesome. Here in 2013, not so much. You can also get the full series on Netflix, so you don't actually need to buy these dvds."
4,watch out for scratched disk,"I love Melrose Place and always will...about the packaging, yes the 1st disk of this is scratched, certainly doesn't look new, but from past postings, i see it must be a MFG defect, good thing is, is i tested it and it works fine, just looks defective.........and the way its setup in the case not like the 1st or 2nd season ones, they were Primo!!! they bunch all the Cd's into the case laying one on top of the other, with dividers, but a more cheesy way. The packaging should have been like the first 3 Seasons were...........but all in all, I love the Melrose Place show itself.........the best!! wish it would come back on TV, reruns!!!"
1,Rating solely based on packaging.,"I have to add to the chorus of bad ratings based on the packaging. Plain and simple, it's cheap. Disc 1 doesn't stay attached and came scratched. And since each disc doesn't get its own case like previous seasons, there are no episode overviews. The discs themselves look generic. The discs in previous seasons had pictures of cast members on them, but this season the discs are plain gray.Melrose Place season 4, however, is great. Very entertaining season. It's the packaging that's the only problem."
5,"This is fast, loud and agressive hardcore music...","...and you gotta have this one. If you bought the daily grind on cd you don't have this album (if you bought it on cassette you had both). I love Leche Con Carne but all of the tunes on Don't Miss The Train are like ""Fields Of Agony"" and ""51 Days"", as in full volume, full force and full speed riffs."
4,good no use for a name but not the best,"hey this cd is pretty awesome. this is also a new release but this time with new artwork and from fat wreck. sounds a lot different than newer no use for a name stuff. personally i like the newer stuff better. tony sly sounds different in this one. but still is a really good album. i guess you could call this hardcore but it isn't teeth-grinding in your face hardcore. the music isn't hardcore, it's more like the subject matter. tracks 1 and 3, for example. anyway, it isn't much like newer stuff from these guys but still decent."
1,"It's a great album, but this is a waste of over 30 bucks","all i can say, is that incognito is a great album, but japanese imports aren't worth the money for the bonus tracks. just go out and buy the original version, and with the extra money you've saved, get ""making friends"" it's a lot better than incognito, even, and you'll still have money left over to buy lunch."
5,you melodic schmucks should go back to phat wreckords hell,"no use for a name is the best example of NOFX ruining the sound of punk with the overwhelming stretch of their style changing influence! this is the best punk album that came out post 1990!!!! i love this album, and always will, i bought several albums by nufan after incognito, and hated every single one of them......that melodic stuff can GO AWAY, and never come back.... what happened to bands with good crunchy song writing???? the hard core and the metal these days all sucks.....but incognito has everything you need!more punk bands need to bring back the captain crunch!!!"
2,Thank God NUFAN changed,"This isn't a terrible cd by any means. I would much rather listen to this cd than most of the other music out there, but that isn't saying much. If you take a listen to NUFAN's album ""More Betterness"" or ""Hard Rock Bottom"" you will see no similarities in those albums to this. NUFAN has, thankfully, matured into a talented melodic punk rock band. This is a cd that was made by young guys just wanting to play crazy fast punk music. There are no real tunes on this, you definitely won't find yourself singing along to it like you will on NUFAN's other albums. Tony Sly has also improved his singing an unbelievable amount from this album. I consider myself a die-hard No Use fan, but I find it hard to like this album. I never really take it out of its case. Not sure who to recommend this album to. Definitely sample before buying."
3,5 stars if Desperado was not included!,"El Mariachi is one of the best movies ever made...IT WAS A 10,000 dollar movie! ,that alone is amazing. BUt even more is that its Very Brilliant.i would have to say Roberts best.And probably the only movie i ever could watch with subtitles on .Now to Desperado----Disapointing! .I wacthed Deserado right after i watched El mariachi,,,it seeemed that rodriguez lost his Touch he had in El mariachi.Desperado was all just action that was so unreal and silly that it just plain stunk.Rodriguez or no rodriguez, this movie lacked originality and realism..the money spent for this movie was a waste...i say its one of the worst sequels out there"
3,4 stars for El Mariachi; 2 1/2 cheers (stars) for Desperado,"El Mariachi's novel plot, taut suspense and action, thoroughly engage the audience. It quickly becomes understandable why it won awards despite its shoestring budget. Fans of tortilla westerns will enjoy it very much. Drawback: Must listen to Spanish soundtrack with English subtitles, because English soundtrack has director's voice over which is extremely annoying and distracting.Desperado is a sequel, but not a match, for El Mariachi. Desperado's excessive gun violence and Pulp Fiction-type slapstick compromise the effect and waste some of the better actors."
2,Complete Trash,"El Mariachi is decent. Considering the low budget it is sort of fun to watch. Desperado however is pretty much a waste of time. I find it incredible that so many people can be giving it high marks, unless they are friends of the director's. The beginning of the film is decent (the parts with Steve Buscemi, Cheech Marin and Quentin Tarantino are good.) The first action sequence is good. After that it is pure trash. No plot. Senseless, boring action scenes. A soft porn sort of scene that is truly pathetic. The director really should have spent some time getting together a good script, because he obviously has talent, he just did not use much of it on this film. Corny, boring junk. Sorry Robert, but you can do better."
4,Recommended for film students and buffs,"This DVD is required for anyone trying or thinking of getting into film - or anyone else who wonders ""how they do that?"" Rodriguez's commentary thru both films is priceless. He gives away all the secrets of making a $7000 film look like a $1 mil film (Mariachi) and a $7 mil film look like a $20 mil film (Desparado). Also, he talks like you're having a beer with a buddy, not some cinema auteur.BTW, I took away 1 star just because Banderas is a little too suave - the 1st Mariachi was better as someone caught in something he didn't understand."
5,"Both are spectacular, but ""El Mariachi"" was a step ahead.","Both of these movies are great in their own rights, but I feel that ""El Mariachi"" is a step ahead. Antonio is super-cool in ""Desperado,"" but in ""Mariachi,"" Carlos Gallardo presents a character that all people can identify with. He's not the vengeful, super-suave killer that was in ""Desperado,"" but a regular guy, just looking for work, caught in a bad situation he didn't create. Good flicks."
5,One awesome movie,"This movie is the best movie i have ever seen. Antonio Banderas ist the best action star. Salma Hayek makes it a good couple. Salma Hayek with her mexican looks is amazing. Specially the shot where these three friends fight Bucho's gang is so cool. I like one thing about the bar: ""the client is always wrong"" written on the wall."
3,wth?,"bought this double set for the el mariachi movie, only to realize after watching it that it has commentary throughout the entire movie. i found this interesting, but i wanted to see the actual movie without the commentary, which you can't do. i like desperado, luckily it doesnt have the commentary throughout the movie that you cant turn off."
3,JOHN maurice ravel,"The narrator's very first sentence is ""Little is known about Ravel's personal life."" The first dance seems to reference that Ravel patronized evening women, as some accounts suggest. The more prevalent theory, that Ravel had a nature in common with other Frenchmen such as Michel Foucault and Jean-Paul Gaultier, does not really come up. A dancer portraying Ravel dances with another man, but the moves between the two are aggressive, rather than affectionate.A lot of the dancing looked like voguing, when it was meant to portray flamenco. You would have thought Willi Ninja did the choreography, rather than a Joaquin Cortez.Because I love Ravel's ""Pavane for a Dead Princess,"" I would have preferred to see a dance using that song, rather than the incredible song just playing in the background of the narration. This work has an anachronistic feel as the string quartet is too diverse and dressed too sexily to have been a quartet from the nineteenth century."
3,Cheap price...,"This set is typically Chinese. The taps or dies will break with alittle bit of encouragement. Doesn't have much for pipe dies in the set. But, the price is pretty good."
5,this is ted nugent ???? :)),this CD is so good i am at a loss for wordsI have treasured the LP for 28 years & here came the CD WITH BONUS TRACKS NO LESS Sounds NOTHING like typical Ted Nugent compares favorably to the Jimi Hendrix Experience4 second mistake on side 2 can you find it ?
5,tooth fang & claw & call of the wild,"my 3 fav of the 8 amboy dukes CD'sJourney To The Center Of The Mind (Repetoire) Call Of The Wild (Enigma 1989) Tooth, Fang & Claw (Enigma 1989)"
2,"STUMED YOU, AMAZON!","THE BEST CD EVER PUT OUT BY AMBOY DUKES WAS TOOTH, FANG, CLAW. TED NUGENTS BEST GUITAR RIFFS (HIBERNATION) IS THERE. FIRST TIME I ASKED AMAZON, I STUMPED YOU. PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF YOU COULD AQUIRE THIS 5 STAR CLASSIC. I'D LET EVERYONE KNOW, AND THAT'S GREAT FREE ADVERTISING. YOUR MY LAST HOPE. I KNOW YOU CAN DO IT!!"
1,Worse Than I Remembered - Which Is Not Much,"I grew up when the 'Dukes were around. I always loved 'Journey' but I never bought any of the Duke album - yes they were actually albums in those days. Now I know why. Ouch! Ted could smoke on the guitar but the group as a whole pretty much comprehensively [stunk]. Compares to Hendrix? Hey give me some of that stuff. Anyway this CD is an interesting historical document in that it shows that my musical tastes were not as warped as the rest of my mind back in those days. Now that I've ripped 'Journey' who wants a great deal on a very slightly used CD?Now how many of you - please raise your hands - really believe that Ted did not know that 'Journey' was a drug song? Sure Ted - here really is an Easter bunny, at least if you haven't blown off its head yet."
1,What a joke,"Ted Nugent is not a musician, he's a fast guitar player. His lyrics are rotten and he should not be taken seriously."
3,So So from Idaho,"My four year old daughter enjoys playing with the pretend money to buy the fruits, treats and snacks.The coins are pretty realistic looking and playing with it will help her learn how to tell differnet coinsappart and how much they are worth. But the construction of the set I feel, is a littleflimsy. If it is moved a little bit the food falls off the shelves and the piece in the front.Depending on the time of day it could be a little aggravating for her, if you know what I mean."
5,Great toy!,"My daughter adores this toy, she cannot get enough of it. One of us plays the shop keeper and the other plays customer. I love that it's teaching her money values, and time (we set different times for the store to open) and she just has a ball playing with it. The pouches store everything perfectly and I love that it folds up and down so easily for play and put away. Great toy!"
5,So Much Fun!,"I purchased this Snack Shop for my 3-year old daughter for her birthday because she and my 4-year old daughter love to play ""what can I get you"" games. They ask us what we want to eat & they pretend to give us what we asked for - sometimes in the form of rocks or sand. This way, we're playing w/ actual pieces of pretend food and are using a faux store front - it's adorable! It comes with pretend money and cards that say how much something is as well as shows what coins/bills make up that amount on the other side. Very educational."
2,It's actually rather boring,"Chris Rea has a deep, smooth and good voice. The songs can be described as slow blues, but not in the Robert Johnson way. But there's a big problem, and that is regarding the quality of the songs as well as the originality. Chris Rea is getting very boring to say the least, with these very slow numbers that lack melody. It's almost impossible to separate one from the other since they all sound more or less the same. If you have sleeping problems, this might be the solution. My advise is that you check out Omar & The Howlers instead - that would most certainly be a better choice."
5,Great Book,Purchased this book for my wives birthday as part of one her presents. We both love Moroccan dishes and flavors of Northern Africa. She's been able to put together some great dishes and very happy with the books illustrations and recipes.
2,Dissapointing,I am of Morrocan descent and was very much looking forward to learning how to cook authentic morrocan food. While the pictures are very pretty and ingrediants all look good none of the recipes I tried came out tasting quite right.
1,Not as shown with quantity of sandpaper,No sandpaper with first shipment - small quantity with second - customer service refunded 1/2 purchase price - item was supposed to be withdrawn??
1,Untrue Description,This item describe as a new. When I open the box the merchandise is used and incomplete according to the decription stated in amazon.
1,No sandpaper - NoSupport,"Looks great - works well!BUT - nobody has paper to fit this sucker. Not even the B&D; web site. Called the ""CALL BEFORE RETURNING"" number. They sent me to their local factory repair store. Called them - they have no paper for it either - but did mention this item is discontinued!!!Am returning it on Monday.Too bad, because it did work OK for the one project we bought it for."
3,"Sander is ok, seller needs work","The product works well for the price, but if your using a sander for big and long term projects you might be advised to look elsewhere. Wear a mask ( I know, its a pain in the butt), but this VERY small dust holder does not work as well as a old fashioned dust bag. It looks light weight, but after a few hours will may find it weighs a ton.The VERY disappointing thing was that it was a used model, that was sold as new ( Amazon), upon opening the box I noticed wide clear tape over the opening, a great indicator that it was resealed. I opened it and sure enough, one sheet was missing, sawdust on the grip....not good Amazon! Yes, I could have returned it, but I needed it now, as stores were either sold out or its on the way out. This is my first bad experience with Amazon, after being pleased with all other orders, but everyone deserves a second chance. My suggestion to Amazon,or black and decker is that returns should be noted, new is new, returns are not."
2,"Decent - but two frustrating, dumb design flaws.","Just picked up one of these for a hardwood staircase. Works well enough except for two frustrating, stupid design flaws:1. The black plastic pad that holds the paper will mar adjacent surfaces with a black mark if you get it to close. Is it to much to ask for a better material here?2. You can reverse the iron shaped pade so the square part is forward to get into corners better - even shows a picture of this on the box. I'm sure it works fine forlow edges. But if you try to get it into the corner where there is a long edge, the front of the case sticks out about 1/4"" to far.It's also be nice if you could remove the dust collection thing for when you're working in tight areas."
4,Not a bad sander to have around.....,"I was looking for a small sander, so when I saw an add on TV for this Black & Decker unit with the dust accumilation it was interesting & checked out the reviews. So for the price took the plunge, it arrived the other day & tried it out. It doesn't pick up every piece of dust, but it does a darn good job. The collection cup does fill up fairly fast, so you have to keep an eye on it to see when it needs emptying, but that's no big deal if you pay attention. And the attachments are perfect for details such as corners or sligtly larger jobs. The velcro system of installing sanding pads is convient, haven't had to get new ones yet, so I don't know how much they cost. So the one downside of this sander it would have been nice to be able to adapt & use sandpaper sheets of one's own choosing. Overall I'm pleased with this item. It won't do the big job of a belt sander, but it doesn't pretend to be one."
2,:( blew up......,I thought this would be a good one. I've tried many others. One of the cylinders burst after about 30 days......not extensive use....I was very disappointed. But thanks to Amazon no prob with returns. I'm still searching for a good airbed!
4,So Easy an Adult Can Use It,"I bought 2 of these to accommodate a large number of house guests. They are easy to inflate and deflate, and we had no trouble with them at all. We only had children/teens sleeping on them. I am not sure each would accommodate 2 adults as the edges are raised and angle in (I assume to keep people from falling out of bed), which makes the usable space 6-8"" smaller than an actual queen sized bed. The directions say that the beds will need to have a little air added after being used for a night, and they did. But plug in the cord, turn on the pump, wait a minute, and they are good to go again. When deflating the beds, make sure to deflate completely or they won't fold and return to their bags. We are completely satisfied with them, though I downgraded them a bit because I think they do not have enough space for 2 adults to sleep comfortably for too long."
5,Amazing Bed!!!!!,"I have never purchased an Insta Bed and had very LOW expectations. This one is everything I wanted and more. Firm, strong, comfortable, very large, thick, Just a really good bed worth every penny. Good Luck!"
4,great bed,"My wife and I used this on our trip to visit her family. We shipped it directly to their house, it was inflated a few days before we arrived to allow any stretching to happen. Added a little air the first & second day to firm it up (and see how it worked), used it the next ten without any issue! Deflation was amazing, the pumps sucked all the air out! This is a great bed, barely noticed when my wife would get up. Only a little slant in the bed due to the weight difference."
5,Very Good Bed,Bought this for trips to college football games. LOVE IT! This bed inflates VERY quickly and deflates just as quick. Easy set up and take down. COMFY TOO
3,Decent for the price but my wife got neck pain from the bed,"I've owned this bed for about 2-3 months now. Pros: Of course the light weight is just awesome. It's amazing to be able to carry a queen-sized bed up the stairs all by yourself. It's pretty well-made. It blows up quick enough and reliably. It held the air well, also. I tended to re-fill it to capacity every 1-3 days, but that's just me - it probably didn't need it - I just like it extra firm. Cons: My wife claimed that it messed her neck up - something about the lack of support. She stopped using the bed and her neck pain went away. There was a strong odor of rubber the first few days, also. The first day, it was very strong. I came home and literally thought that the sewer backed up or something. After a week, the smell was gone, though. That's about all I can say about it. Decent for the price, but use at your own risk."
5,Love it,Inflates very quickly and very comfortable to sleep on. Was not difficult to deflate and fold up to get back into the bag. Love the fact that it sits high off the floor as it is easier getting up off of.
1,Not worth it,Does not live up to its reputation as being qood quality. Sure grip bottom did not prevent it from moving when placed on a carpeted floor. Worst feature was the way it sags from the edges of the top toward the middle of the bed. Quite obvious soon as it is full of air but more importantly extremely uncomfortable for two people. We returned it which is something we rarely do. I do not recommend this product.
3,It's only OK...,"I am a little disappointed with this airbed especially because I purchased it based on many positive reviews. I had my first guests and they told me that although the bed does not leak, its sides (outside rim) are too high (even after trying to adjust the balance of inflation of outer and inner chambers). As a result one gets trapped in the center of the bed like the bed is sinking in the middle."
4,Works great,"I've been using the mattress as a bed since I bought it a month ago, and it works great. It doesn't loose air quick, I leave it inflated all the time."
3,Good while it lasted,"This is a comfortable and convenient air mattress, but in my case it only lasted about two years, whereupon one of the ""cells"" in the middle of the bed became detached and bubbled up, making it unusable. I guess for the price that's about what one would expect, but next time I will spend more and hopefully have a more durable product."
2,Quality Control Issue,The two Wenzel Insta-beds I purchased had leaks. Amazon was kind enough to send two replacements that so far are OK. I am very concerned about the quality of construction of the Wenzel beds.
2,Not satisfied,"After about 8 uses (over 2 1/2 months), the motor died which fills both chambers. Before it died my parents said they seemed to roll towards eachother in the center (they are average sized and not heavy). Sadly, we are returning this product. I was hopeful, as it was fairly nice quality until it stopped working."
4,Great bed,This bed is a decent buy. It is too heavy to use as a portable bed for camping or whatnot but it is extremely good for those who need an instant guest bed that will stay inflated for longer periods of time. It is also raised so feels just like a regular bed.
2,"Comfortable at first, but has sprung a leak after 1 month","I bought this bed a month ago and have been sleeping on it with my partner every night (our bed is in storage, we're in the process of moving). It was pretty comfortable, but I have two complains.1: The sides of the bed were higher than the center of the bed, causing us to roll towards the middle. We solved this by taking enough air out of the bed so that it was level, but this caused the edge to be under-inflated and thus not sturdy. Whatever, we dealt with it.2: The bigger complaint is that after a month of gentle use, it has sprung an undetectable leak. We now have to fill up the bed at night, and by morning nearly half the air is gone. We can't find the leak and I think we'll have to throw it out."
5,So far so good,Have used this air mattress only once so far and it held air and its shape much better than other air mattresses we have had. Had guests use it for a couple of weeks and they were happy with it.
4,"Comfortable, Sturdy, Durable","My guests slept on this air bed for one night and made the statement, ""this is the best air bed we have ever slept on"". They said it is so comfortable, and really loved its height, how far it came off the ground. They are thinking about getting one and putting it in their guest room for their guests to sleep on.My wife and I slept on it the next night and Oh Boy!!!! Excellent! This is top of the line in air beds. I have not slept on many, and now never will, b/c I plan on keeping this one for a long time."
4,great bed,easy just pay attention to other reviews. i love this bed. great for everyday use. do not blow up all the way at first.
2,sliding bed,I just bought this air mattress because I read alot of positive reviews but am not satisfied with it. Everynight we inflate it we were comfortable but after an hour or so it would lose air and we would both start sliding toward the center. It was very uncomfortable when both of us ended in the middle. It would of pershaps been better to buy 2 twin size instead of a queen. I don't really recommend this product to anybody. Pershaps a twin for each person but never a queen for 2 people.
1,DO NOT PURCHASE,"I purchased this bed for my parents to use while visiting over the holidays. It lasted three days. On the third night, the mattress rapidly lost air (during the middle of the night) and I have not been able to locate where the air is leaking from. It is not returnable and so I spent $100 for the use of an air mattress for three nights. Two and half if you want to get technical since my parents ended up on the floor by 1am. Also, my parents are elderly and this was not a pleasant experience for them. I was greatly dissapointed in this product and would not recommend anyone to purchase it."
2,Bam!,"After a couple months of moderate use, it kersploded. It was just me on the bed. I am of average weight, I wasn't jumping or standing on it, it wasn't even very full of air. I repositioned myself, it went pop, now I have a lumpy child-sized bed. This is not a small hole that can be patched. It is a catastrophic rupture.Edit: It's still under warranty, so I called customer support. Wait time was less than a minute, and it sounds like getting a replacement should not be too difficult. The customer support representative sent me an email while I was on the phone, so I have a personal contact--much better than some anonymous support@company address. Will update further when the replacement has been received."
1,These beds are only good for a few months,"We'd bought one for our cabin. In six months, used less than 10 times. Popped whilewe were laying on it. (No we are not fat.) VERY poor quality and abysmal customerservice! Wenzel would not replace nor refund. Absolutely useless! Beware!"
1,The bed that wouldn't hold air,"We were traveling to visit family and had ordered the bed to be shipped to their house so it would be there when we arrived instead of having to pack it and drive it up there. Little did we know that we had purchased a defective product and the bed would not hold air. We attempted to work with if for 6 hours (while we were visiting family) and finally gave up. Luckily, in a town of 2500 people in Michigan's upper peninsula, the only store in town sold a nice coleman queen inflatable with built in pump that we were able to sleep comfortably on. The only redeeming feature of this purchase was Amazon.com's easy internet trade in system where you print a label from the computer ship it back for free.I should have remembered the Wenzel tent I purchased 2 years ago when the center pole snapped in half after two uses!!! I guess this is a brand to avoid completely. I have certainly learned my lesson."
4,Great alternative bed,We have had guests sleeping on this bed for about a month. They said it was very comforatable for them. Only had to add air maybe 4 times while they were here. We would recommend this product.
1,Very bad product,It developed a slow leak and now the pump has stopped working. I've only had it a short time and I'm considering sending it back if that is possible. I didn't keep the original packaging. It was an expensive experiment and I'll be buying a sofa bed for extra guests. $100 totally wasted.
5,Great guest bed,"We bought this bed to use in our guest room. Upon receiving we immediately opened and inflated the bed. The built in pump fills it completely in about 4-5 mins. There was a slight odor but as others have said it is similar to a new vinyl shower curtain and does dissipate after a few days. We had guests staying within a week so we left it filled to make sure it was going to hold air properly. We were pleased that it felt great and held its air very well. For extra comfort we bought a mattress pad for it but keep in mind that you'll need to use sheets that have deep fitted pockets due to the mattresses height, 22 inches. Our guests are very pleased with its comfort as they continue to use it now, already 3 weeks, and with only having to occasionally fill with some air. We highly recommend this Wenzel bed!"
3,ok to use,had it for 6 months with frequent use. I really did not see any issue for that. Works ok and relatively is comfortable. The only thing is it easily gets form and compress in one side.
2,Wenzel Insta-Bed Queen,"The bed inflated quickly, which was a plus; however, after sleeping on it the air leaked out. That's why it was returned. After inflation it was quite firm. The next morning it was too soft. Almost like climbing out of a hole."
1,Used one time,Only used once and it never stayed inflated for this amount of money thought it would had lasted at least one day.
2,Buy at your own risk,"After reading the reviews, I still took a chance on the good reviews. But the reviews that spoke of NOT holding air,(not even for one night) has been true for my purchase. I am so disappointed!!! Unless you are a gambler and you feel lucky, I would steer clear."
5,comfortable,"The bed was easy to inflate and very comfortable. Its sits very high which is better than other air mattresses I've used that lay low on the ground. We left it inflated for 2 days it I didn't seem to lose much air, if any. Hopefully it holds up for many more uses."
2,It does leak,"I had high hopes, and spent more than a lot of airbeds cost, to finally get one that didn't leak.Not so much. It leaked enough overnight that it wasn't very comfortable. Tried it several times, pumping it up more and more, with the same results.I returned it."
4,The 1st one leaked but the second one is great!,"The first bed that I ordered leaked badly within the first 24 hours. I returned it and took a chance and ordered another from Amazon. It arrived just in the nick of time for my house guests. That was 3 weeks ago and since I was expecting another house guest soon, we decided to leave it inflated. It has inflated for three weeks now and I haven't had to add any more air! We have been lounging around on it and I'm happy to say that it is quite comfortable. I did notice that the ""sure grip bottom"" doesn't really grip on a hardwood floor. I put a very small ""no-slip"" rug pad under a portion of it and now it stays put."
5,"Convenient, easy set-up and take down!","I reviewed many air mattresses before purchasing this one...what a great buy. It is so easy to pull out of the canvas bag, unroll it and plug it in. Several minutes later you've got a standard size queen bed! My MILaw slept on it for 5 nights straight and said it was very comfortable~ while she was visiting our cleaning lady came to mop the floors---I simply turned the dial to deflate, rolled up the bed and put it away in just a couple of minutes.! Unrolled it back out once the floors were complete and her queen bed was ready again in no time!we are very satisfied with the mattress and its convenience and comfort. I highly recommend for anyone who needs a quick bed with very little ease!"
1,Jury is out...,"Read many reviews and was super excited about purchasing this bed since we were about to have our first child and would be expecting several out-of-town guests. From its first use though, it leaked and had to be re-filled with air each night and our guests were very uncomfortable sleeping on it. After about 10 uses there was a big bubble coming from the interior chamber and by morning our guests were virtually on the floor it had sunk down so low in the middle! Unfortunately, Amazon only has a one-month return on this item and so by the time we discovered it was defective, the month had ended and they will only offer a partial refund (?) and require buyer to pay shipping both ways. Not fun. Going to call the company and hope for better customer service there!"
1,leaks down horribly,"I ordered this for a back up for my son that was coming home for Christmas. I followed all the suggestions of inflating and deflating several times before putting any weight on it. I didn't need it to be perfect, but it is awful. My son weighs about 140 lbs. and he can't get through one night without losing 1/3 of the air. It would be great if we just had to touch it up each night, but this is terrible. I think my son would rather be back in his bunk in Iraq!I can count on one hand the number of products that I have returned to Amazon. This would be one of them if I could. Unfortunately, I ordered it early so that it would be here and I could do the prep before he got here for the holidays. Now I'm out of my return period.oh and my husband and I laid on it and we roll to the middle. There is NO WAY that two people could sleep on this."
5,Very good air Mattress!,"My Husband and I moved and decided to put the old mattress in the garbage, and to buy a new one while in the new place, we got this air mattress to sleep on it meanwhile and it's working great!I will use it a lot for the family and friends that will come to visit!"
4,Great Product! Exactly as Advertised!,I was impressed with the product! Very impressed - with one issue - I couldn't find sheets with deep enough pockets for the mattress! But was it BIG - Yep. It is BIG - It is clearly a raised mattress! I didn't give it five stars because of the issues w/ the deep pocket sheets - and maybe that is being unfair!
4,airbed review,The bed is very comfortable and hold the air well. My only complaint is that sheets don't stay on very well because there is nowhere for them to grip-the indention is not quite deep enough.
5,Very Pleased,"After researching several brands of air mattresses and reading the reviews we decided on the Wenzel Insta-Bed. My 17 year old grandson, who is 6'2"" found it to be extremely comfortable. My brother and his wife visited us for a week and each morning they reported a very good and comfortable nights sleep. The height of the bed made it extremely easy to get in and out of. It is very easy to inflate and deflate. The sheets stayed in place. We did have to add more air twice during that week, but I believe that is to be expected. I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend this bed to anyone."
2,didn't stay inflated,"We used this bed every day for almost four weeks while family was visiting from out of town. It inflated easily and relatively quickly. It would have been ideal if the inflation tool shut off automatically when the bed was inflated, since it was hard to be sure when inflation was complete - but this is a small matter. The bed was was a good size and was moderately comfortable. It was softer than anyone preferred, and made a lot of noise when one moved on it, but I suppose that's normal for an air bed.For the first week, it held air well. For the second week, we had to re-inflate it every day. But after about three weeks, it didn't hold air at all. It was a soft, sagging mess that trapped us in deep pockets and pushed us off on to the floor. Repeated attempts to re-inflate were unsuccessful, as the bed always lost its air in reasonably short order.The bottom line is that I can't recommend this bed for anyone who plans to use it for more than a week."
5,"Great bed, so far.","I do love it, however, air beds are unpredictable. The Sure Grip feature does not grip as well on a wood floor. Periodically, I need to move it away from the wall. The noise it creates when it rubs against the wall is very annoying. Otherwise, I repeat, I love it."
2,Purchased two beds - second one leaked - can't return.,"This is the second Wenzel Insta-Bed that we purchased, the first bed was excellent and has held up well, but the second bed has a bad leak and can not be returned. We purchased these beds so that we would have a place to sleep when we visited our children in other states. It was so disappointing when we visited our daughter's family recently and the bed would not stay inflated and the leak was so bad that we couldn't repair it. It's too bad that products are not made to last. I'm sure the other bed will probably develop the same leak in time."
2,Wenzel air bed,"Bought on line, got it 2 days later, easy , just push two buttons and it inflates and same thing to deflate. Its been used for last week straight with good air holding, comfortable, especially if you put a extra blanket on it. big enough for two, though we've had on 200lb 6ft 2inch male on it comfortable. Nice to not have one that you end up on the floor in the AM."
4,Very pleased with the air mattress,I purchased the mattress because I was having foot surgery and I didn't want to climb the stairs. The mattress was very comfortable. The height also worked well because it wasn't hard to get in and out of bed. From time to time I had to add more air but that was not a problem. Very easy to inflate and deflate.
2,Disappointed,"I bought this product based on the good reviews it had but was really disappointed as the product failed to perform from the time I got it out of the box and set it up. It was leaking air continuously. At one point, it deflated on its own by about 30%. In addition, the smell of the plastic was overwhelming. I was really disappointed and thank goodness Amazon was willing to refund me 100%!"
2,Leak developed after 2 uses,"Although the air mattress seemed durable and was comfortable, after using the mattress only 2 times, a leak developed. My husband and I woke after about 2 hours of sleeping to find ourselves sunken on the floor. The leak was so quick and the mattress so deflated that we were stuck in the middle of the air mattress on the floor while the sides of the mattress were up in the air, making it really difficult for us to get out of the bed. We had to sleep (or try to sleep) on couch cushions for the remainder of the night. I am returning it and hoping for a full refund, given the 1 year warranty."
2,Stitches ripped,This was a great bed until the top stitches started ripping out and the bed started forming bumps all over the place that made in uncomfortable to sleep in.
5,Love This Bed!!!,"I purchased this bed about a month ago and I don't regrett a thing. I read about every review and searched other stores for what I thought would be the best purchase. For some reason I kept coming back to this one and I'm glad I did. With the build in pump inflation was a breeze, it took approx. 5 mins. You just want to be sure to have everything cleared away, because this is a ""big"" bed (queen). I purchased the mattress cover in queen size, wish I would have gotton king because it does slip up a little. However I did purchase king sheets and covers and it was perfect.As far as loosing air...maybe every 4 days, I'll inflate for just a minutes and it's back to the firmness I prefer.I'm even sleeping better so I happy with this purchase and would recommend it to others. The other point for me...I don't worry about bed bugs!!!!!!!"
2,Deflated significantly overnight,"I was really sorry about this bed, which I returned within a week. It is wonderfully comfortable--easily as comfortable as my own bed--but I tried it three nights in a row, and each morning I woke up to a significantly deflated mattress. Given that other reviewers here have had better experience in this regard, maybe I just got a dud. By the way, like all inflatable beds, this one emits a very powerful chemical smell. I imagine it would dissipate after a few uses, but if you get it, plan on putting it in a room with an open window at first."
4,Great bed for company,I ordered the Wenzil Insta-Bed Queen Raised Sure Grip Bottom with Built-in Pump to use when company comes. I was very pleased with the ease and speed of inflating and deflating it. My company said it was very comfortable and easy to get onto and up from. I have never had an inflatable bed before so am not sure if any are better designed to hold the sheet in place; from the picture I had the impression that the fitted sheet would slip into a crease; that was not the case. The flocking held the sheet OK but not as well on regular mattress. I would recommend the bed to others.
3,Great while it lasted,"This air mattress was extremely comfortable while it lasted. I always received compliments from my guests and never felt bad about having company sleep on it. It really does look like an actual bed when fully inflated. The air mattress comes in a great carrying bag and inflates in about 5 minutes. The pump is of good quality and deflates the mattress even more quickly. The mattress is heavy and feels high-quality. However, 1 year and 2 months in, I had a guest over and she ended up almost sleeping on the floor. The inner chamber had developed a leak in the middle of the night and now the mattress is unusable. This would have been fine for a Walmart air mattress or whatever, but for one at this price, I am unsatisfied. I think it should have lasted longer, especially since I always put a thick blanket down on the floor before inflating it. I'm so disappointed since this was such a comfortable bed."
1,Not impressed.. Sent back after one night. Defective,"I purchased this item after reading about an hour of reviews. I was excited to use the product on a upcoming camping trip. When the item arrived I inflated the bed according the the instruction book and immediately noticed that the outer chambers inflated approx 4"" higher then the inner camber. This caused a V shape to the bed. I tried even letting some air out of the outer chamber and adding more to the inner but if you laid to close to the edge you would fall out then. I figured I would try if for the night, that was a mistake. when I woke up about 7 hours later, the bed lost about 2"" of air and had a back ache from hell. I packed the bed up and had UPS pick up the package 6 hour later. That's my experience. I reorder a different mattress from a different manufacture, have my fingers crossed."
1,Difficult to sleep on after the center chambers separate,"Over the past year and 5 months we have used the Insta bed approximately 5 times. Today we began filling it up for another use and as we did, the center chambers separated creating a large bulge in the middle of the bed. I would have thought that it would be useable for more times than this. I was surprised to find that the warranty was for only 1 year. The previous inflatable bed we had served us well for well over 5 years and many more uses than this one. Now I know not to consider Wenzel when I replace this bed."
3,ummm,"Received the mattress and blew it up; was great for a couple days but then started losing air. We were sinking into the middle every night making it very uncomfortable so then we had to pump it up everyday. My boyfriend is 230 and I am 128 so the sinking was pretty significant after air started leaking. They say it stretches, too and it did. Queen sheets fit the first 3 nights then we had to use the flat sheet on the bottom as it was too small. I would have had to get king size to fit. Returned it. I am sure some work great but ours, unfortunately, was a flop. Seems to be built well and is durable."
3,Nice Tall Bed,"It's a nice tall bed. It is almost too tall to fit well within our room. Because its so big and thick, the bed never really feel firm. However, after 2 weeks of ownership, the bed hasnt become much more deflated. The bed is loud inflating and deflating."
2,Bad Product but great seller (Amazon),"I purchased this air mattress 5 months ago on Amazon. Long story short, a few nights ago my boyfriend and I went to sleep on the inflated bed and woke up on the floor because of a hole in the mattress. No kidding. This ""premium"" air-mattress lasted only 5 months. I gave the bed 2 stars because even though I did not like sleeping on it, my boyfriend thought it was comfy and slept on it without problem. If you decide to buy this pretty expensive mattress, don't have high hopes for it in terms of durability and anticipate that if your mattress rips/breaks after Amazon's 30 day policy, you'll be forced to deal with Wenzel and their limited 1 year warranty which depending on how great their customer service is, could have you eating the cost of the mattress."
4,Easy inflatable bed,"Comes with a built in pump and storage for power cord. Plug it in turn the dials for the upper and lower chambers to inflate and the mattress is ready in about 10 minutes. Held pressure during 3 day visit and was as comfortable as a regular bed - improves a bit after use as the product stretches some initially. Plug in again to deflate, turn both dials to deflate setting and all air is sucked out and ready to fold and store.A bit heavy for travel (24lbs?) but could be checked on a plane in its provided stuff bag. We'll probably keep it at home for guests - I think a pillow top mattress cover would make it perfect."
2,Prone to leaks,"I bought this bed for guests coming over, and it's already spring a leak after 2 times of use.The design is poor because the hard plastic holding the pump controls cuts into the softer elastic material when you fold the bed. This creates tears around the pump controls. I don't know how the designer could not have anticipated this.The patch adhesive that came with the bed doesn't work well, so my guests have now had to endure sleeping on a bed that turns soft in the middle of the night, only having to repump it every morning.The materials used are too fragile for normal use, so stay away from this product."
4,Wenzel Insta-Bed,"This bed is a definite improvement over the Aerobed. I have had several Aerobeds; most of them leaked. This air matress is very stabel,comfortable and, does not leak. The built in pump is very efficient. Have just used the bed for a short while, but it is the best one I have experienced and for a very reasonable price."
4,D,"For the short term, this bed is wonderful. It really holds air well, and it's very comfortable to sleep on.I specify short term because after almost exactly 2 months, I came home to find there was a small hole in the inner chamber. For the next week I waged war on this mattress, patching it in a variety of methods, but the hole size/quantity kept increasing. As the outer chamber was still solid, the effect was that over the course of the night, I would sink to the floor in the middle while being surrounded by the outer chamber.Kind of felt like a hammock. But not in a good way.For 2 months it was totally worth the purchase, as I wasn't ready to invest in a mattress. Happy I bought this, and had no qualms with throwing it away when finished.If you buy you'll probably want to try king size sheets after it's stretched out a little, because queen size doesn't fit too well post-expansion."
4,Good confort and fast to inflate,"My biggest impression is the speed to inflate and deflate it. In like 5 minutes you can inflate/deflate and enjoy your bed. The noise to inflate is not extremely high, is almost the same of one aspirator.The confort is ok, you can make it more soft or hard, separated of the height. So, basically they have 2 parts, one is the height and other is the ""cover"", which is really to cool to customize based on the person/couple.When done, it grips to the ground and do not move.The only downside so far is the sides inflate more than the middle, which is not great for people that like to put the feet out of the bed."
4,Helps with a full house,"The Insta-Bed queen inflates very easily and quickly. It's quite large and thus requires a good size room for set-up. Perfect, when our Grandkids came to stay, but, when my husband and I gave it a try, we each woke up achy and not well rested. Save it for the young, strong visitors. Still, I think it was a good value and glad to have it on reserve."
2,Okay but pricey,"Only lasted for about a couple of months before it sprung a leakWe were using if for guests then lent it to a family member who reported it started leaking the second day they had itDon't know the circumstances or reason but for the price, it would have thought it would have been more ruggedThe leak is in the seam so it is nearly impossible to fix"
2,weird,"Had to return this product simply because of the dual chamber, which I thought would be a positive. There is an inner chamber and an outer chamber. If you don't get it just perfect you end up sleeping in a canoe. Which by the way got worse the more we used it."
2,Not very hardy,I purchased this for my daughter and it only lasted a couple of weeks. I expected it to be made of a thicker material.
1,No contact from manufacturer for warranty service,"I purchased this air bed for a spare bed to be used by guests. Immediately upon trying this air mattress, it was apparent that it wouldn't support two people. It sags terribly with two people regardless of how often you try to inflate it through the night. I thought that maybe the mattress was faulty, but I can get no response from Wenzel for any warranty service. I would not recommend this to anyone."
2,"Great, if it would stay inflated!","I've had this mattress for less than 6 months, and used it during a move between apartments when we didn't have furniture (roughly 1 weeks use). Unfortunately, on the second use, we discovered that during our sleep, the air slowly deflates from the bed, and if you're sleeping on the side, you'll likely roll off onto the floor - quite a startling experience, let me assure you. Sadly, you can't re-inflate the bed quietly - it uses wall-powered pumps that are very loud - so you're relegated to sleeping in the middle of this bed, and heaven help you if you must share the bed.I tried returning it to Amazon, but the return policy only extends 30 days, so I'm left with a mattress that's ""kinda"" good for a night's sleep, but not worth the money if it pulls these tricks in less than 6 months."
4,Works Well,"I bought this because of the price and because it's a little thicker than some other models I was considering. Overall the product works very well, although I do advise blowing it up and deflating it once or twice before actually using it to break it in a bit.The pros: Stays inflated, is nice and big and is very comfortable.The cons: The the inflate/deflate motor is a bit confusing at first, but I figured it out. The storage bag is flimsy.Solid purchase!"
2,"Good design, poor quality","I received the bed via express shipping for a $60.00 charge. When it arrived, I immediately set it up. It was great for the first night. By the second night, it had begun losing some air from the inner bladder, not too bad though. The air loss increased throughout the following week so that I was reinflating the mattress several times during the night. I was hoping this airbed, due to its dual bladder design, would last a while, but it did not. I have yet to find one that has any lasting power. I will not purchase another."
2,air bed,It was a beautiful and comfortable bed but would not hold the air. We would put the air in it and by morning you were sleeping on the floor. Sent the 1st one back and the 2nd one did the same thing. I would not refer this to a friend.
3,Wonderful while it worked....,"This mattress was soooo comfortable that we kept it inflated on our 3rd floor man cave as an extra bed. I slept on it quite often when my husband was going through a snoring problem, but I digress. I preferred sleeping on this over our King bed in the master. HOWEVER, as soon as we deflated it to use it on a trip it never held air again. the center chamber will not stay inflated, however the outside one does. We bought it in Feb and deflated and traveled with it in April - of course the warrantee expired March 30th, so we are out the money we paid for 3 months of use. Not a good value. However, if you are LUCKY enough to get a good one that works - you will love it."
1,Not the quality expected for a high priced air-bed,I purchased this bed in September for guests I was expecting and used it myself too when they left after a week. However in less than a month I found it losing air in the night and it was annoying to use the noisy pump a couple of times at night. I have used other cheaper air mattresses in the past and they lasted longer than this higher-priced piece. I expected better.I called the customer service to exercise my warranty and they said they would forward me documents towards the same. I still haven't received anything. I am not happy with this purchase.
1,"Defective, DO NOT BUY!!!","Only used 5 times before it became unusable. The mattress now has a huge pocket of air in the middle of the bed when inflated. Its like the inner walls broke that normally trap the air.Originally, I was really excited about this product, but considering I only use this when guests stay with me, and this product defect led to a very uncomfortable nights sleep on the couch, I urge you not to take the chance that this won't happen to you."
1,defective...,"We enjoyed this bed for about 5 days, found it very comfortable and easy to inflate. However, one day, we walked in to find that it was pregnant. That's right, there was a huge bump in the middle of it, and nothing we did could get rid of it. An inner chamber must have burst or something. We never moved it, etc, so believe that it was something faulty with the bed itself. Just glad this happened in time to get a refund. Also have to note that some family members got the same bed around the same time and had to send theirs back because it was saggy in the middle - we did not have this problem with ours, but because we both had defective beds, we decided not to replace it and just get a refund."
1,"Horrible, Horrible, Horrible *Stay Away*","We bought this mattress only looking at the positive reviews. We should have looked at the negative ones. We used this thing 3 times, by the 3rd time it would no longer hold any air.I called the company (On hold for almost an hour). The lady tried to tell me they test each one before they leave the factory.Since we hardly used it, only when guests came over, it was over the 30 day warranty period.I called Wenzel, they told me I had to call Amazon. Amazon told me it's to late.STAY FAR FAR FAR FAR FAR AWAY FROM THIS BED"
5,Very comfortable air mattress,This is the second Wenzel Insta-Bed for us. We purchased one about a year ago and liked it so much we bought another. The Wenzel offers firmer support and feels much more like a regular bed than many other similar products we have owned or used. The built- in inflator works quickly and efficiently. We used the first Wenzel at Burning Man and decided next year we will have wall to wall air mattress in our tent so we purchased another bed. This bed would even work for use in the home use as a spare bed when needed.
1,oh my aching back!,This has to be one of the worst beds I have had. It is so hard and the coils in the middle stick up and hurt my back. I really hope I can return it!
1,Dud,This bed leaked right out of the box. The pump is built in so when you wake up because half of the air has leaked out you can reach over the side an turn pump on to refill it. It doesn't get more convenient than that!! What a great bed.
1,US only product. Very disappointed,"I bought this as a bed for my son & wife for Christmas. On arrival I realized that it was only for US power, I will have to purchase a transformer to operate it in Australia, this will cost $100+, or return it which will also cost me. It was not clear in the information about the product that it is US only. A lesson certainly, I shall only buy locally in future."
1,Fc@@ck WENZEL,"WENZEL SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES FOR MAKING A EXPENSIVE BED THAT IS GARBAGE. I WAS EXCITED ABOUT THIS BED AT FIRST , BUT AS YOU HEAR AT FIRST I BLEW THIS BED UP AND MY OTHER HALF AND I WENT TO BED AND WE WAS SUNKEN INTO THE BED WITHIN A HALF HOUR AND WAS CAUGHT INBETWEEN THE MIDDLE OF THE BED, THE MATTRESS IMPLODED FROM THE MIDDLE OUT. THE MAN TOLD ME ON THE PHONE BEFORE I ORDERED IT THIS WAS THERE FLAGSHIP MODEL, I BEG TO DIFFER WELL HIS FLAGSHIP MODEL IS GOING RIGHT THE HELL BACK!! COMPLETE GARBAGE."
5,Excellent,"For the price nothing can beat this mattress. We've used it twice for a total of nine days. Our guests have been quite pleased, preferring it to a $4,000 wall bed."
3,"ok for an air mattress, but let's not pretend it's a real bed","I thought this bed was more comfortable than other air mattresses I have tried. I appreciated its height off the ground and the ease of pumping and deflating. We bought this bed primarily for house guests, and slept on it ourselves for several nights after a recent move. We found that it sagged in the middle even after one night. I am amazed that others who reviewed this bed did not have to put air in every night, because ours was definitely not firm when we woke up. There was no obvious leak, but I suppose there could have been one that we could not detect. We returned the bed and opted for a guest mattress instead."
4,Good Quality Air Mattress,"I haven't yet had guests sleep on this air mattress yet, but we had it blown up for a day or so to see how well the air stayed in, and were happy with the results. It's a nice large size, good for two people. The automatic air pump is great, and makes filling it up and deflating the air mattress really easy. It takes a few minutes and is noisy, but I don't mind that for the convenience of having the air pump included in the mattress. Once we have guests sleep on it for a night or two we will know better how good this mattress is, but so far we are happy with the purchase."
1,Strong Odor . . .,"After reading all of the good reviews, we were happy to order this Wenzel bed. Shortly after inflating it for the first time, we were forced to deflate it and pack it back and remove it from inside our house because the vinyl & chemical odor was too strong for us to tolerate. It actually made me sick. We placed it outside with box open so it could ""air out"" overnight, but it is still just as strong and horrible. We are extremely disappointed and can't get it to fit into the original box to even return it for our refund. Why can't anything be made in US now? And why does everything have to be dipped in so many chemicals and be so toxic?"
1,having trouble with product,"when i rec'd the bed, i checked it out,and inflated it, it seemed fine. i bought the bed for my company coming from florida. they arrived on 6-22-11. i inflated the bed as instructed, 1st night it went flat, i am so embarressed. 2nd night same thing, 3rd night same thing. i do not want the dam mattress. i am so upset with what happened. i am not quit sure what to do about getting this returned, and getting my money back. can you please help me. thanks june talley"
1,Useless product - impossible to deflate,"Only way to deflate it is with the motor. But the motor is so strong that it sucks the plastic tightly around itself, which ends up choking the motor. Was never able to deflate it, and had to throw it out."
1,Look Out Below,"This is the second of these that I have purchased, though the first from Amazon. We have relatives visit throughout the year, after all this is Maine :-). Anyway, the first lasted about 4 months before it tore around a seam and the in-laws headed for the floor. The company that makes these replaced this with a much smaller and cheaper model. We figured the first was a fluke so we ordered this one as it is much larger and seemingly better then the one they sent us. So imagine my surprise when just 4 months later, once again, the thing tears in the exact same place as the first, this time my elderly Aunt headed for the floor screaming in the night!I thought Amazon would make this right, the reason i bought it here to begin, but they tell me I have to deal with the manufacturer again. Not looking forward to fighting with them, being promised an equal replacement and then receiving the lower end model. My advice, stay clear of this model or at least the left side of it."
2,Didn't last too long,"This bed is very comfortable but it's life was short. The first two times the bed was used, it worked perfectly. The third time it was used (which was within the first month of purchase) it lost so much air that my guest had to refill it at least twice during the night. I thought that this bed would be sturdier than other air beds since it can be used outdoors, but this wasn't the case."
5,Air bed.,"Found this to be an excellent bed, pros are longer air retention (I sleep at least 5 days before needing to turn on the pump), uniform pressure distribution. I normally do not have any back problems and this bed did not introduce any new ones after about a couple of months of regular usage. Our guests loved it, the only con I can see is that the pump is so slow - takes a minimum of 4 minutes to fill the bed from flat and takes similar time to deflate. That is negligible compared with the pros, we recommend this product to anyone that is interested in an Air bed."
4,Good buy....,"Purchased the bed to use on a trip and slept on it a month. I was prepared to see some stretching so filling it the first several nights was not unexpected. I guess I got carried away though, and it looks like it is now a king size bed. When we use it again, I plan to get king sheets with deep pockets I'm pretty sure that will solve the problem. I will also use either a memory foam topper or a couple of quilts to soften up the surface. It's not perfect, but it IS an air mattress and as a temporary, easy to store solution, I was happy."
2,Queen for One,"The bed is supposed to be a Queen size, however with the raised sides you gravitate to the middle, making sleeping for 2 people uncomfortable. You are basically getting a Twin but with a Queen size footprint. The bed is going back and I'll have to spend the money on an Aero bed which actually gives you a full Queen size sleeping area. The reason I give it a 2 star rating was it is actually pretty comfortable for a singe person, but way too large to really use as a single."
3,Best for only one person,"We bought this air mattress to use at our daughter's new apartment until a bed could be purchased. My husband and I slept on it for a couple of nights. I have major back issues, and found the mattress uncomfortable, since having 2 people on the mattress caused a ""dip"" in the center. The mattress did hold the air well, and I think if just one person was sleeping on it they would do fine."
1,We were Deflated,"We ordered this air mattress for some guests arriving that weekend. When we inflated it, were very disappointed as we heard a hissing of air on one of the seams. It went back into the box immediately and we ended up buying one at Gander Mountain. Despite positive reviews, this one was lame."
5,Happy with purchase,I ordered this item and it came within the espected delivery time. I had no problems when I opened the product and it works great for the price I paid.
1,Don't Buy this Bed!!!,"Don't buy this bed!!! I purchased this bed in Dec. of 2010, and have only used it two times as an extra guest bed in my home under normal circumstances. The outer chamber is leaking with no visible holes or tears. I have contacted the company on their website, and have not had any response from them. This item is not worth the money. It would have been more cost effective for me to put my guests in a hotel near my home."
4,Good Buy,"Easy to inflate with the built in motor...that's a big plus being all attached. The height on this bed is wonderful; you can actually sit on the edge to get up. However, the firm sides causes you to roll to the center and if you're sleeping with someone you'll become cozy all night long! Which could be a good or bad thing."
4,SHEETS?,We love this mattress; it's been camping once and used in our home a lot. My ONLY grumble is that I can't find a bottom sheet that will fit well enough to stay on the bed. Has anyone found such linens?Great bed though.
3,have not had the best luck!,"We first purchased this bed in March of 2010. Our first mattress lasted about 18 months with no problems. Then the inside chamber would not stay inflated. Called the company and the customer service rep was very nice, but our 1 year warranty had expired. She did offer me a discount on a new mattress. I received the new mattress in less than a week and after using it twice the exact same thing has happened again! The outer chamber stays inflated but the inner chamber goes flat. Called the company again today and they are willing to send me another mattress this time in a different model. Hopefully this time we will have better luck. Other than the issue of the inner chamber not staying inflated, the bed does seem really nice and provides a comfortable nights sleep for an air mattress."
5,Nice Bed - Quick and Easy,I ordered this bed for family coming in town. It was large enough for a 6 foot male. Set-up was easy and only took a couple of minutes to inflate. Air leakage was not a problem. Fits into bag provided with product. Good overall purchase.
4,Wenzel air bed,Excellent shape but bed leaks down during night. It is likely due to design of air valve which is otherwise a good design.
1,DON'T buy this mattress!!!!,"I bought this mattress after I read hundreds of reviews on consumer reports and amazon reviews. I ignored the bad reviews of deflation because of the overwhelming amount of good reviews. I've been using this mattress for 7 days before I can go back to my hometown to get my ACTUAL bed and low a behold, I come home to a massive LEAK and HOLE in the SEAM!!! This product is seriously defective!! A hole in the seam! Come on! You spend $100 thinking you'll get something that will last, and it should!! Seriously please don't buy this product. Just imagine having to get up every 3 hours to reinflate it because you wake up with your butt on the ground. There is definitely a better, probably cheaper mattress out there that actually holds up."
2,Died after 5 months,"Single user (mostly), 240lbs. Received mattress in late January 2011, inflated and began using in February. On 25 June a ""blister"" (a large bubble) developed on the top, about 16 inches from the foot of the bed. It is in the center, 3 feet across (width of bed), 21 inches long and 5 inches high. It is getting larger as I was able to continue using the bed until this morning - 4am. Was able to keep using the bed because initially the small bubble corrected the trough that had developed in the bed.Bed was inflated to a moderate firmness and did not leak. Once I had the desired firmness set by the end of February, never had to add air.Note: If you return the mattress under the warranty, you pay for shipping.The $20 Ozark Trails mattress I got from WalMart was still working after 6 months!"
3,"Good airbed, not impressed","I got this bed thinking that it would make me forget I was on an air bed. It is certainly good, but it didn't.It is just not firm enough and it kinda deflates a bit overnight. Also it takes a really long time to get fully inflated.On the pros side the material seems to be super strong, it is huge, and the included air pump makes it easier to get ready."
3,smells plastic,I would not reccomend this product because it is not comfortable. It is tilted to the sides.The smell of the plastic is horrible.
4,Surprisingly Comfy,"This bed is surprisingly comfortable. We use a memory foam topper covered by a mattress protector and then sheets etc. When its all made up, it looks like a real bed because of its height. We have been sleeping on it every night for a month and have had great sleep.Inflation is a little noisy and it doesn't inflate quite as fast as it says it should (but it doesn't take too long either). The plastic is really smelly, particularly when it first arrives and then anytime its left in a room with no air ventilation.Despite that, I think its a fantastic buy and would recommend it to all."
5,Great Spare Bed,"I am so pleased with this bed. It inflates easily with the built-in pump (took ~5 minutes). And the pump deflation helps get all the air out so you can fold it back up to fit in the bag. I put regular sheets on it and they didn't fit perfectly, but they didn't slide around or slip off. I slept on this mattress alone once and it was great. However, I slept on it with my husband once also and we ended up rolling toward each other (which happens with all airbeds I've been on). Perhaps we should have inflated it more. We've also used it as a spare bed for visitors and they said it was better than their regular bed. It does seem to lose a little air overnight, but that might just be the plastic stretching still. Overall, I'm so glad I purchased this bed. It was a great value!!!"
4,Wenzel Insta-Bed Queen Raised Sure Grip Bottom with Built-in Pump,"Easy to use. Very comfortable. A little heavy, seems to lose air each night. Overall a very nice bed."
1,Does not hold air,"Purchased one and it was immediately defective, would not hold air. I was able to exchange and get a new one, but that did not help my guest at the time. Replacement seemed ok at first. Read the reviews about stretching and needing a refill - my experience is ths this is much worse than stretched fabric. One small adult was almost on the ground every morning. Two people can't sleep on it or they roll into the middle together, until the air is gone, anyway. I plan to try a different brand or get a futon because it's embarrassing to have my guests go through this."
1,Don't do it,I read the reviews and bought this one. It's horrible. There are two air intake pump knobs leading me to think there are two air air chambers independent of one another. I am only 5 foot tall and light. It sags something horrible inthe middle and loses air way too fast. Skip it. Look for something else. I'm sad. I really thought this as going to be the one after reading the great reviews seen here. :o(
5,The Best Air Bed I've Seen,"We have guests at our house fairly often these days, and we've tried two other inflatable beds in the past and our guests always said they were uncomfortable. But not this one - it's very nice, inflates and delates quickly and easily and is much ""taller"" so it seems more like a regular bed. No complaints whatsoever. Very nice. Don't waste your time and money on the other brands."
2,Not Satisfied,"I purchased this Wenzel bed, the reviews I read were all very good, Well I filled it with air and it performed very well. I understood that the material would stretch and I continued adding air every night to take up the stretching. After a month of keeping it filled, it still goes down every day. I have tried to check for leaks with a spray bottle of soap and water and cannot find any place it is leaking.The bed also fills more on one side of the bed, so one person rolls to the other side of the bed and you have a very hard time getting out of bed. It is a very comfortable bed when it is full of air but it will not stay full for the night and always fills more on the same side. The middle sinks in and the Girl friend is not happy!!"
5,A good night sleep,Purchased two Wenzel's so we could sleep comfortable while updating a rental home. It's been over a month and were sleeping good. Set up was simple and we add air about once a week. We like being off the ground (22inches). Only problem is when two sleep in one bed you sink to the center. A tip online was to put blankets in the middle to build it up and put your sheet over the blankets. It works ok but not great. Overall I like the Wenzel and the price enough that I will purchase one more for quest that want to stay.
2,Slow leaks,I have owned several aero beds and other queen inflatables. This one had a consistent slow leak that I could not isolate with soapy water and a lot of wasted time. It did not occur when someone about 100 lbs slept on it the first few nights. For the price I expected a better quality product. Since it was a gift to a relative the burden of returning it is significant and will probably not happen. I consider this a product I would never repurchase or recommend
4,Instabed in a tight space,"We are overall quite pleased with the product. We bought it for an upstairs bedroom in an old house where the steps are too steep to bring up a standard queen size mattress. The instabed was great solution since it can be inflated after it is brought up stairs. It is extremely comfortable and easy to inflate and deflate. My teen age daughter loves it!It was recommended to us by a friend who also has this model and felt it was ideal for guests because it is easy to store and has an internal pump to inflate and deflate the mattress. This is a very attractive feature of the mattress, which is well worth the additional cost compared to cheaper mattresses that we considered that lack this key feature.Unfortunately our first mattresses leaked as soon as we set it up and needed to be returned. Amazon was great about helping us get a replacement without any hassle!The new bed has been trouble free and we recommend it highly"
4,Not bad!,"Ordered, arrived, and worked as expected. Bed is nice and tall, but slides easily on the carpet or whatever floor it may be on. I didn't experience any noticeable air leakage, but found myself airing it up to the maximum every couple of days or so (maybe it is leaking). Bed seems to dip in the middle compared to other inflatable beds, but I think that's because it sits higher than most inflatable beds on the market. The bed is very comfortable and I got a good nights sleep every time I've used it.Overall, I'm satisified.Thanks!"
2,"Good for a weekend, Doesn't hold up for daily use.",I have been using this bed for over a year and it worked great for about two months. But then it started leaking. I patched it up but it just kept on leaking. Finally decided to get rid of it and buy an actual bed. I would recommend this as a guest bed for a weekend.
5,Great Bed!!!,"This is a wonderful bed!!! I have issues with my back and shoulders from a wreak and I wake up with no soreness and refreshed each time I sleep on this bed. It is very easy to get on and off of it with the higher height. I really believe I sleep better on this bed that my regular bed! Even with two adults on it you get a great night of sleep! Very easy to set up with the automatic built in pump. Did not lose alot of air during the 3 nights we used it. It does feel a little cold on the cooler nights however I am going to buy a mattress pad and I feel this will fix that.. This is the 3rd air bed I have owned and the best!!!. If you want a nice portable, easy to use comfortable bed, this is the one to buy."
4,Very pleased with the product,we did a lot of research on available air beds and settled on this one mostly due to the height and integrated pumps. i was a little surprised how small the package was and greatly surprised to see how big the bed was once inflated. and that only took 4-5 minutes to be fully inflated. it has been inflated for 4 weeks now without any air loss although it has only been slept on 2 nights. we bought it as a guest bed and they said it was quite comfortable and easy to get in and out of.
4,Wenzel Insta-Bed Queen Raised - built-in pump,"Very comfortable, but it seems to lose air very quickly. The people using the bed had to put more air into it at least once each night. It was easy to inflate, and easy to put away."
4,Insta-bed is an insta-win,"Easy to setup and easy to put away. The first night it lost some air, but the following nights it held and was a very comfortable sleep. I highly recommend this bed."
3,Just ok,Not very comfortable. But it was ok in a pinch. Lumpy and tended to roll to the middle. It did hold it's air ok.
1,Worst purchase,"I purchased this bed Wenzel Insta-Bed Queen Raised Sure Grip Bottom with Built-in Pump about three weeks now and decided to give it a chance. The first night it was not very comfortable, so I took some of the air out. This did not make a difference at all. How can u manufacture a bed that sinks in the middle. Not very comfortable at all. One thing I can say is it does not loose air that quickly as the others I bought. That the only good thing about this bed. This is my third bed and this is the worst of the worst. It is very uncomfortable. The bed sinks in the middle. It has bulges at four sides of the bed and"
4,The best air mattress I've slept on,"We bought this mattress to use as an extra bed for guests. Unlike other mattresses, this one stays inflated! No sinking into the bed as the air seeps out during the night. This one stays full for weeks without re-filling. It provides a fairly supportive bed too.I've slept on the mattress several times and found it to be fairly comfortable. Not as comfortable as a real bed. But, good nonetheless.Overall: I recommend buying this one. I've tried the others (Sealy, Coleman, etc.) and none are as good as this."
3,Wenzel Insta-Bed,"OK for 1 person, but it sinks in the middle, making it very difficult to get comfortable with 2 people. Having said that my 3 year old grandson loved it and jumped on it endlessly, so I guess it's pretty sturdy"
1,"Save your money, look elsewhere","Bought this mattress for extra sleeping space for the upcoming holiday season, and upon first inflation, the mattress won't hold air. Filled it, left it over night, and it was half empty by morning. Read their remarks about ""stretching"" and needing to add air after it stretches. Filled it again, and 6 hours later is was a third deflated again. Totally useless. I saw the overall 4 out of 5 star rating and figured it had to be good, but my experience reads like all of the 1 star reviews. Won't hold air. No obvious leaking points. We debated a futon or this air mattress, and figured we'd be better off just getting the air mattress. We should have just gotten a futon."
5,Worked out very well for us.,My wife and I have been using the bed for about a month now and is working out very well. Easy to set up and hold air very well. Does have a slight tendency to roll toward the center when sides are blown up too much.Dan
2,No good for two.,"We received our Insta-Bed today and will be returning it promptly. The 'sure grip bottom' is acctually a void of 2-3 inches deep within the perimeter of the bottom side. When you lie on the bed, it creates a suction if it's on a solid surface like a hardwood floor. Also, the top has a raised edge around the perimeter. Both of these factors result in the feeling that you're sleeping on a slant, unless you are alone in the middle. The bed might be okay for one person who didn't mind sleeping in a valley. No good for two."
4,Worked just fine ...,Had relatives over for a week and needed an extra bed. This worked just fine and didn't lose much air at all during the week. My only complaint is that it slid around on the hardwood floor. Probably not a problem with carpet.
4,"Very nice bed, even better with a little adjustment","I got this bed for when we had more than one set of guests. After reading reviews, it sounded like a great air bed for an attractive price. It had a little bit of a plastic smell after opening and inflating, but that disappeared after one day. I had it blown up for about 3-4 days the first time (without using it) and it kept air pressure great. When my parents came to visit they slept on it for 5 nights in a row. The first night they mentioned they were sinking toward the middle a little bit. After letting some of the air out of the outer chamber, they found the perfect setting. It held air great, and is very comfortable. Unlike my older eddie bauer air bed, which I would pump up as much as I could, and would be half on the ground by the morning. I would highly recommend it."
5,EXCELLENT PRODUCT,"GREAT BED FOR ONE PERSON, A BIT CHALLENGING FOR TWO. HOLDS AIR, DIDN'T HAVE TO REFILL ONCE FOR A WEEK LONG STAY. IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP SHEETS ON. I USED A FEATHERBED AND PUT THE SHEETS ON THAT. MY DAUGHTER THOUGHT IT WAS QUITE COMFORTABLE, MY SON NOT SO MUCH. OVERALL, I AM HAPPY WITH THIS PURCHASE."
4,Good value...,"Easy to inflate and deflate. Seems comfortable, although we have not actually slept on it. 22"" height makes it easy to get onto and up from. Good value."
4,It worked for the Family,"This was intended as a mattress for family members to sleep on. We took out this air mattress and filled it up at first just to test it out and let the smell of newness waft away. It stayed inflated for days without having to reinflate. We took it down, used it for family and they didn't seem to have any complaints so I call it good. I was impressed how long it stayed inflated. Easy to take down, put away, etc."
5,Outstanding insta-bed,"Best i've ever seen/used. My kids won't stop sleeping on it is so comfortable, they prefer it over their real bed.So thick, It doesn't feel like your sleeping on the floor. Wish I bought two!"
1,Flat from day two.,Got the bed. Cool concept. Used one night and couldn't keep air in It. I am 6' 200 lbs. No wild nights either. Only reason I won't return it is the hassle that outweighs the price. Bought a $35 inter from Target. While not as cool and requires out side air pump it held the air.
4,Good airbed for the price,"I bought this to replace a Queen Aerobed I had. I used this and the Aerobed as a bed on a regular basis. Both airbeds lasted ~8 months before they began to have structure problems. The Aerobed when inflated didn't keep a rectangle shape but had bulges along the length sides. Both were comfortable. I placed a Japanese traditional futon on top and had lots of pillows and I sat in bed to do work or watch TV often. I only had to re-inflate once every 2,3 weeks to keep the firmness I liked. Comparing price, this Wenzel was cheaper and with Amazon Prime shipping it's a great deal. The problem I encountered with this product was the seam separating the top and the middle began to loosen up, making bulgings on the sides. Soon after, the outerchamber began to lose air despite my re-inflation. I didn't attempt to contact customer service for replacement as I needed a replacement right away and had already bought an Intex one at half price."
3,"Really good in the beginning, but wearing out quickly","This was the best air mattress I'd ever seen, by far. It's the size of a normal bed with a box spring, and was quite comfortable. I used it during a move for a couple of weeks, and have had guests sleep on it.But after about 30 nights of use, it's noticeably sagging in the middle, and doesn't stay fully inflated throughout the night.Even so, it's still the best air mattress I've seen..."
5,I use this as my regular bed.,This bed is great in providing comfort for minor back pain and a great nights sleep. I have had this bed for over two years and just bought another in case this might blow at some point.
1,Does not hold the air,"I bought the bed for a girls weekend in Port Ludlow!It filled up so nicely-but in the morning it was really low on air.We re-filled it for a second try and when my girlfriend who slept on it woke up the next morning shewas in the middle of the bed half way to the ground.I have a call into Wenzel so I am going to try to return it and get another one, I will post again once I am done with that process-fingers crossed."
2,Worked great for 10 times and then:(,"This bed was very comfortable for what it was. I was super pleased with the purchase I had made until... Unfortunately this bed had literally only been used about 10 times and then it started deflated for no reason. My toddlers were using it to sleep on at my sister's house and the next morning when they woke up they were flat on the floor. Not sure why it started to deflated. I only ever kept it inflated when in use and I then I would directly put it away the next morning. It was never even around a pet or anything that could have scratched it, so I'm just not sure why it stopped working. Considering the money we spent on it I would have at aleast expected to get a year out of it. Won't be buying this brand again to replace it."
4,Great,"Super easy to unpack, repack, and inflate. Rises to full size given in sales info. Pretty comfortable for an inflatable bed. My parents slept on it for a week and only had to add a little air once. The non-skid bottom is great for hardwood floors."
3,wenzel insta-bed,"I found this product easy to set up and to breakdown.The biggest draw back was that the deep pocket queen size fitted sheet did not stay in place. There was not enough corner for the sheet to snug into which allows the sheet to slip and slide....off. I personally did not sleep on it. I purchased the bed for some out of town guests who thought their nights sleep was very comfortable (despite the sheet thing) and I believe their 5 month old golden/doodle thought so as well, the crumpled sheets didn't bother him.Note: I did add a one inch thick memory foam mattress cover which added a little more comfort."
4,Still holds at 3 years.,I've had this bed for 3 years now. It truly is easy to set up and take down. The raised height is wonderful if you have a hard time getting up and down.The one thing my guests have said it is very comfortable but when you get too close to the edge it does rock some like you may fall off but no one has.Sheets so stay on it with no problem.The built in pump is a plus as some brands it madke it so you cannot put it right up against a wall this one you can.
5,Great purchase,"This Queen-size high-rise mattress was shipped to our daughter's home in Virginia. We slept on this mattress during our 12-day stay in VA during the Christmas holidays. We added only a little air two or three. The built-in pump worked great. My husband is 6'1"" and weighs about 230 and I weigh 115. I didn't roll in toward the middle! We slept very well for 12 nights. This air mattress was more comfortable than many hotel mattresses. Our daughter added a $25 foam mattress pad that greatly increased our comfort and warmth. I definitely recommend the foam pad. We also used king-size fitted sheet that was recommended by another reviewer. No leaks, great comfort. Easy set-up and quick take-down. Great purchase!!"
1,Save your money,"This mattress looked so promising when we first set it up. It inflated easily and looked relatively comfortable. Unfortunately for my guests, the middle portion deflated in the middle of the night and my guests chose to sleep on a hard floor. I guess I'll just stick with the cheap, one-use mattresses from Walmart."
2,not so good,"I purchased this item at Amazon. Size is great, inflates and deflates wonderfully. However, there is a slow leak somewhere as it sags in the middle and must be inflated after a few hours of sleeping on it. Even one person must inflate it in the middle of the night because it sags in the middle. Very disappointed."
1,horrible customer service,I ordered this bed and when I received it I realized that it was too large for the sleeping alcove. I did not take it out of the box and returned it to Wenzel after calling them for an RA#. I returned it UPS on February 20 and as of today and despite numerous emails they have not credited my account. I am telling everyone I know to not do business with these people.
2,sprung a leak in no time; think twice about buying so much plastic!,"Think twice before buying such a bed. I slept on this bed while waiting for my furniture to arrive in my new home, a couple of weeks. Eventually, I started waking up on the floor, in a big hollow in the middle of the bed. I found the hole, a separation in a seam. I tried to patch it using the patches they provided (following the directions) but they couldn't hold back the force of the escaping air. I called the company, who are very helpful and nice. They forced me to destroy the bed -- cutting out the logo and sending them a photograph -- and then sent me a new one. They told me to ""recycle"" the old one. I called my town's recycling center and they don't take airbeds made out of PVC plastic, so I ended up throwing this out and now it's in a landfill *foreverI!!! They sent me a new one, which I don't want to use. I don't want to dump another airbed in a landfill. A real dilemma."
4,great value,"This inflatable bed is amazingly good, as far as inflatable beds go I was very pleasantly surprised with the quality and comfort. I highly recommend this bed for short periods. I slept in it for two weeks and as long as I kept it fully inflated I was quite comfortable in it."
1,might as well sleep on the floor,"Forget it...just save a space for yourself on the hardwood floor. This thing lost air the day we got it. It loses at least 25% of its air each night. Had a Coleman before, for years. Loved it, but now it is off the market. Next step? Will try to return this thing. If not, use it as a tarp."
3,Hole in the bed - pump overheated,"Bought this bed because it got good reviews and noted for higher quality. Bed came out of the box with a hole in the bottom -- when I tried to deflate the bed for return the pump overheated half way through which requires 30 minutes or so to cool down before restarting. Maybe I got a lemon? Amazon is sending me another and I will update this review as appropriate.Update: Amazon did an outstanding job of getting me a replacement bed in a couple of days - the new bed seems to be holding air fine. One thing you need to keep in mind - these beds are made out of plastic and even after 3 days the mattress still has a distinct plastic odor which would probably offend many people. The odor gets better every day but if your buying one for guest coming I suggest you plan ahead and get it at least a week and probably two weeks before you buy it and let it ""air out"".Original bed with hole in it rated a 1 star - replacement bed rates 4 stars - moved my rating up from 1 to 3."
2,Good for the occasional guest,"We bought this for overflow guests. Most of the reviews are complimentary, and we would be as well if it didn't lose it's inflation overnight. It drops enough to incline the user towards the middle of the bed. If two people, it is far worse. The only alternative is to add air during the night. I wouldn't want to wake up realizing I need to find the control and add air. It would be loud, and would further wake you up.Even fully inflated, I wouldn't confuse this with a real bed. It is a single( for the mattress) bladder and feels like it. Hard or under inflated. I have water floate s wih 6 bladders and they work well, why not that kind of control here?Wouldn't recommend."
4,We have 2 of these now.,"SO overall, this is a good product. My sister bought one of these about a year ago, and loves it. Matter of fact, she has been staying at my house, and using it to sleep on. She even has a 60lb lab that sleeps on it with her. She does use blankets, but it is on a cement floor and has not had any problems what so ever. She said she only has to fill it up with air about once a week. The one that I ordered, I have only had for about a month, and used it for 2 nights. I wasn't even the one sleeping on it. I got it for the kids because we had a lot of people here, and made the kids sleep on it. I laid on it the second day, and can say that for my liking, it was a little soft. I tried messing with it to get the firmness up, but it didn't seem to do anything. I guess, as long as I don't have to sleep on it all day every day, I am fine with it being a on the go mattress."
4,Wenzel Air Mattress,Bought the mattress several weeks ago. Kept it up for several days to test whether or not is was losing air. It seemed to perform well for this test. It's comfortable and I hope that it will serve me well for a long time.
2,"Enjoyed it the first few uses, but then a bubble formed","I love the height of this airbed and the fact it has an inflatable pump. However, after a few uses a bubble formed on the top of the air mattress. It doesn't leak, and it didn't pop. But I suppose one of the internal components that keep the top of the bed flat busted, which causes a huge bubble to form on the top. Unfortunately it has been more than a year since we purchased it and it doesn't fall under warranty. Probably a fluke, but bad experience for me."
4,Air Bed,"We have had several air beds, so far this has been a very good one. We have only used it about five times but we have been pleased."
2,Didn't work well,Bought this for the visiting inlaws to use and after the first night my Father-in-law was almost sleeping on the floor due to air loss. Tried again day 2 hoping this would have improved after stretching out and while it was a bit better product still lost a large amount of air leaving this product sagging deeply and almost looking like a taco with a person in the middle. Tried it out one last time filling it with air and having no one on it. After a few hours of letting it rest the air loss was still pretty major so I printed out a return slip from Amazon and will send this back tomorrow.
4,A great buy..,"This was a great buy. Its way cheaper than an Aerobed and more comfortable. It takes a good five minutes to inflate and the same to deflate, but, its worth it for the value and comfort--of which there is lots. ;) Def recommend for folks looking for a guest bed! One thing: its kind of heavy and doesn't squish down that small...but, I am over it. :)"
4,"Good Value, and a comfortable airbed","It's a pretty good bed, one of the best in its price range. The only complaint would be that it's a little harder to get all the air out (due to the location of the built-in pump). But otherwise, it's working great so far, and keeps its air for several days. It may need a little top-up from time to time if slept on by 2 people (or one larger person)."
1,Don't waste your time.,"The built in pump would cease working while filling and when releasing air, but worse was the fact that the bed sunk in towards the middle - regardless of how much air was inserted. To stay on either side of the bed, you'd have to hang on to the side. I returned this bed the very next day."
1,Product malfunction after 6 months,"I purchased this product in March of 2012 and at first the product worked great, comfortable, easy to inflate/deflate, and easy to store. After 6 months of use the outer pool suddenly failed to retain air. The leak was slow, but the mattress would only be useable for a period of 4-6 hours for one person and less than 3 hours for two people. The worst thing about the malfunction is it was not just a simple hole that was able to be patched. Rather it was an outer pump issue or something else internally focused that could not be manually fixed. Since this was outside of the 30-day return policy I was forced to eat my initial cost without any recourse."
4,Great product with a small flaw,"This is a great product allowing comfortable sleep. Easy to set up, but the wide ridge around the edge tends to throw you toward the center of the bed. Good quality construction."
3,Not worth the price,"I was close to 2 stars for this product. I actually ended up returning it, so I probably should have been tougher on them. But, the reason I returned it was more related to price for quality than anything else. I can't blame Wenzel for setting the price wherever they want to, they just can't expect me to pay it.I just didn't find this bed comfortable. Plus, it's just too big. Takes up a ton of space, both filled and folded. If you have enough space for this thing, why not just get a real bed?I ended up buying an Intex bed for half the price. Honestly, it's just as comfortable (not great), and half the price. So I'll take the savings..."
1,"BOUGHT 2, BOTH LEAKED!","This air bed, out of the box, was the best one that I had bought so far. It was comfortable, felt as close to a real bed as you can get, and the built in 2-way pump is awesome. However, the first bed I bought leaked after 1 night of use. I contacted Amazon and, to their credit, they replaced it even though the return period had expired. The second bed arrived and performed in the same manner. It held up for 1 night and then started leaking again. I don't believe we abused the bed or misused it in any way. There was no kids jumping on it, and my wife and I only combine for about 330 pounds. I am going to attempt to get a refund for this 2nd bed, but I don't have very high hopes. For spending $100 on this air mattress we are very disappointed in it."
3,A bit disappointing,"I purchased this about 1 year ago. It has suited it's purpose and I will use it again for overflow company, especially children. I find the mattress very cold to sleep on. I put a foam ""eggcrate"" mattress over it and that does solve the temperature problem I do not feel it holds air as well as advertised. When used by adults, I think it needs a little re-inflating at least every other day. However, because of the electric valve, which is probably the best part, inflating and deflating is not a big deal. We use this in an unoccupied room in our upstairs and the queen size is great for 2 adults or 2 children without taking up the whole room. I've yet to find an air bed that I think is wonderful, but this is probably the best I have purchased."
3,Sagging middle,"I've had this for about a month. I like it, but I'm also disappointed. Whether it's air leaking or whether it's stretching, the result is the same. I wake up sagging in the middle of the bed. Each night I have to pump air into it, and each morning it's sagging. If two people are in the bed, both tend to slide into the sagging middle. Other than that, it's very comfortable to sleep on."
4,George the Saint Bernard,"Ok so I'm biased. I was on the set of George in Grindelwald, Switz. in the early 70's and got to meet Marshall Thompson(Daktari), George and Inge Schoener who were all wonderful. This movie pre-dated Beethoven by 20 years but it's great for the whole family. I particularly loved the beautiful shots of the Swiss Alps in this movie."
3,Well well,I watched it. I blew the dust off it and wanted to see my old actress Trudy Young. IS she in this movie??? Please let me know or where i can see her acting.
2,I would like to review it..but I need it first,"This is not a review of the product...just a complaint to Amazon and JET for a delayed order. I purchased it on May 17th. It is June 25th, and I just received e-mail from Amazon telling me it will not be until August 9th before I get it. I called the local stores (Woodcraft, and Rockler) and it seems to be a manufactures issue (they have back orders as well). I am unhappy with Amazon because they just notified me after 5 weeks and no product. I am unhappy with Both JET and Amazon for not having any forum in which to contact either of them with issues. So I am Whining and crying here because I want my new toy!!I have never had a problem with Amazon in the past, and like I said it looks like it is JET that is at issue with the delivery. If you order this Item DONT be in a HURRY to get it."
2,Sloppy,"Jet failed to machine the holes used to connect the extension to the orginal lathe bed. I had to go out and buy a grinder bit ($26) to ream out the holes so that the extension would sit flush. If I could go back, I would buy a different brand of lathe just because there is no excuse for such sloppy manufacturing. That was a 50% increase in the cost of the bed extension.The tech support told me to just grind it out, instead of just sending me a new one. Perhaps they should either make them right, or over drill the holes in the first place."
5,Jet Lath Bed Extension,"I purchased the Jet 708355 Bed Extension to go with my Jet Variable speed lath and I must say that the quality exceeds my expectations! Right out of the box, following the instructions, WHAM! Perfect set up! No problem's here. Again, Hat's off to Jet for their great product's and to Amazon for such fast shipping (Recieved it in less than 36 hrs.)"
4,Greatly increases capacity.,"Extension makes the Mini Jet a much more capable tool. Too many times I have had to modify or quit a project because of turning size limitations, while being tied to the portability of a mini-sized lathe. Now I can turn much longer pieces and still move my longer Mini around my mini shop.Only complaint so far is mechanical attachment could stand some reinforcement and more positive alignment--although so far, after some initial struggling, I achieved a functional coupling of main body and extension."
2,Bummer,"The rail only fits current models, as hive an older model it won't bolt up.If your midi don't have 2 small holes at the end of the rail don't buy it!"
3,Not a typical JET experience for me,"I had to return the first extension received as there was no way to ""tweak"" it satisfactorily. Second extension arrived a few days ago and is better, but still a problem to align with the lathe bed. I have spend a few hours trying to make it work smoothly, and have made progress, but this is frustrating.I love the mini lathe, but the extension is not 100%. If you think you will ever want a longer bed than the 14"" the Jet mini has, purchase on that comes that way."
3,Good but Jet could have done better,"I have a mini Jet and wanted to be able to do a little larger work. The bed extension did not just bolt up, I had to do some drilling, filing work that I feel with the money spent I should not have had to do. Once all that said and done it did give me the option to do larger work."
1,Terrible Music,"I mistakenly believed that this CD was to be similar to the Schoolhouse Rock series, which is how it is being marketed. It is in fact not at all similar. This CD is poorly produced and the music is amateurish in composition and performance. It is clearly intended for the Church bulk-giveaway market, where I understand it is doing well.There is 1000 years' worth of GOOD Christian Music that I would recommend for children before this. There is SO much good Gospel from the last century that we should be listening to instead of cheap, money-making gimmick CDs. There is good Country, R&B, Rock, Soul, Classical, Choral, Renaissance, and Hip-Hop music out there that is Christian. Don't waste your time on this garbage. Music FOR your soul should HAVE soul! Your children will know it!"
5,"Great music, nice transaction.",I've been looking forward to get this CD since quite some time ago and finally was able to get it. It was a nice transaction and have no complains about it.
5,Scripture Rock is special. A GREAT LIVE BAND- GREAT SONGS!,I love the live band.It's so much more alive and fun compared to other kid's music.I love the way the songs are written!My little ones all know the scriptures and they had so much fun learning them.I think if anyone has really listened to Scripture ROck they will know that there's no better children's music and no better wy to teach the words of the Bible to little ones. I want to know of more really good CD's like Scripture Rock.
5,Troy&Genie&#65533;s music is AWESOME.,"Troy&Genie's music is AWESOME. It will fit right in with what I am doing in my Kid's Church. I have thrown out all of our flannelgraph, overheads, and chalk boards. We are totally multimedia with data projection, dvd, computers, etc. - highly interactive and fast-paced. Troy&Genie's music is the final piece to the puzzle to make it a high-energy experience for the kids! Thank you, Troy & Genie!!!!!!"
5,A Must-Have Kid's CD,I can't believe we lived without a CD like this for so long. My kids learned the 50 Scriptures on it within a few days. But we didn't even realize we werre learning because the music is so fun. I feel like I've done a great thing for my kids.
5,These Verses stuck with me.....,"My mom bought ""Scripture Rock"" for my sisters and I when we were young(pre-teens) and the catchy songs are still stuck in my head at the age of 22, in fact I just re-purchased this cd and the second volume for my own 2 year old because I know they will have the same effect on her and she will have the scriptures running through her head on a regular basis :)"
4,this was fun,"I have only built a handful of these Gundam model kits but I think this was the most fun of any of them. The other kit I HQ e built were all high grades, this one is what's called a no grade its cheaper and not as detailed out of the box. If you just slap it together it only takes something like an hour and a half, but looks horrible, if your like me and enjoy a challenge and aren't afraid of some paint you can make this kit look very good, I've got about 8 hours into mine and other than a few piece that should move and don't, you can't tell it apart from the high grade kits next to it on my display, the beam saber is solid which is always disappointing but it will transform into bird mode. If you like Gundam, especially Gundam Wing and aren't afraid to do a little work you will be pleased."
5,Gundam Wing 1/144 Model Kit Zero One,The item arrived right on time is a good kit for not being a high grade kit It's a must have for any gundam wing fan.
3,Very small model,"I got this model many years ago at Target along with several other 1/144 sized ones. I built all of them in a day, they're simple even for children. I didn't like the size so switched to 1/100 from then on. These are fine though for kids or people with less money to spend on the larger more detailed versions."
4,Gundam Wing,The item arrived early and with no damage to the box. My son is now starting to collect them.
1,Disappointing Ghost Story,"The synopsis sounded great, but what disappointment the book turned out to be. I found that I was skipping whole paragraphs, especially the ones dealing with excessive and explicit sex, just to get the book finished. I found the author's over description of the sex scenes offensive. This book jumped around too much - no cohesiveness, it wasn't insightful enough to fully grab my attention. No substance!When I finally reached the end of the book, disappointment awaited me - there did not appear to be any closure, a complete letdown. I would not recommend this book."
5,a ghost story,"a blending of the horrible effects of poverty and the irish potato famine and the coffin ships...with banshees, suicide, a loveless marriage, and the ghost of an invisible girl who knew she was never wanted......who comes back to present times. i couldn't put it down!"
5,Simply gorgeous,"What a beautiful, unexpected novel. I was so taken by this, this carefully written, melancholy ghost story with redemption and love and seduction, all mixed in together. Carey has a lovely use of language."
5,Very thought-inpiring and emotionally moving...,"The reviews stated below describe the book exceptionally well and I will do little to add on to them.. but I feel that this book had an emotional impact for me.. it really hit home and nails several key issues lingering in my heart. The book relates to the pains and pleasures of life and death. It details the loss of innocence and the maturing of the mind. It describes in depth how time changes people and how the aches of yearning of had-beens and what-ifs can develop and consume people. I felt a whole array of emotions when I read this book but overall, I felt it had a good, if bittersweet ending and is definately worth reading."
5,Astonishing and moving,"What an astonishing, lyrical and moving work, full of layers and portents, and the kind of meaning that can't be snatched but only experienced. The story folds back on itself, obliquely wise as poetry underneath a surface of deceptively simple prose, the whole humming with resonance. This is one of the best books I've read in a lifetime spent devouring them."
5,Excellent ipod adapter,I was a bit skeptical of this product but decided to take a chance on it. The installation was fairly easy on my wife's 2006 Honda Odyssey. The radio had to come out but that was easy and the USA Spec hooked up in the back with the correct plug. We've been using it for about 2 months and we are very pleased. The sound quality is perfect and it keeps the ipod charged. It also turns it on and off when you would expect (like when you turn off the car). Very nice.
5,Works like a charm!,"This was very easy to connect to my 2001 CL Type S, and it sounds great! Highly recommended!"
4,A wonderful book!,"I purchased this book for my mother, who has been looking for it for a long time. My grandma used to read it to her when she was a child. I, also, have read a chapter or two and find it very interesting and well-written. I especially liked her description of what it was like to have lived during the early part of the last century. I would recommend this book to those who like stories of real people having very interesting adventures."
5,I MARRIED ADVENTURE,"A GREAT ADVENTURE FEATURING, TWO VERY INTERESTING HUMAN BEINGS, IN A SIMPLER TIME WHEN MAPS OF THE WORLD STILL SHOWED LARGE AREAS MARKED ""UNEXPLORED"". THEY LIVED AN INCREDIBLE LIFE AND THIS BOOK GIVES IT ALL TO YOU BACKED BY EXCELLENT PHOTOGRAPHY FROM A PERIOD OF BOX CAMERAS AND HAND-CRANKED MOVIES. GREAT READING!"
2,Keep Searching for Dracula,"I went into this film knowing it was a quasi-documentary, and that didn't bother me. I always got a kick out of 70s-era supernatural pseudo-documentaries like ""In Search Of ..."" and I am a sucker for those UFO and ghost story ""documentaries"" that frequently pop up on The Discovery Channel. I also have a huge soft spot for Christopher Lee. ""In Search of Dracula""'s problem isn't its premise. Its peoblem is its cheap and poorly done execution. The film is muddy and poorly lit. It moves at a snail's pace. It is padded with three long segments of public domain silent films. And the film print is in poor condition, so the movie looks awful. The only thing to recommend the movie at all is Christopher Lee, who is always a class act and a pleasure to watch and listen to. A curiosity at best."
1,"Don't waste your money, I'll give you mine.","I must confess that I have not read the oracle book that comes with this set, so I can't comment on it. I didn't bother to read it because I was completely turned off by the artwork of the cards themselves; terrible, terrible artwork. I am appalled that this set was even published and feel foolish for having purchased it. The cards themselves are nothing but amateur, unfinished sketches. As sketches they look like they show some little bit of promise, but the artist never went beyond the sketches to come up with a finished product. It literally looks like the publisher figured they had a week to put out a product that might possibly ride the coattails of the movies' success. Unfortunately, this product is only suitable for the roundfile."

4,A welcome collection of beautiful English music,"This is a marvelous introduction to Gerald Finzi, an underrated English composer whose conservatism left his music out of fashion in mid-century, but who is at last gaining deserved attention today. By all means listen to this and to the English String Orchestra disc on Nimbus, which offers another excellent Finzi collection. Those with vocal interests will love the exquisite song cycles on Hyperion (Varcoe & Hill w/Benson) and choral works on Chandos (Finzi Singers)."
3,great but not complete,"the knives are professionally made and balanced. beautiful, but it was shipped from the distributor without a paring knife. no fault of sabatier, but of the distributor, whom I am trying to contact now to remedy, without this problem, I would rate this product a 5. thanks"
5,Worth every penny,"of the discounted price, of course. I gave it 5 stars because I can't think of anything to complain about. The knives look beautiful. I especially like the fact that there are no seams anywhere, including the steak knives. The matte-finish steel handles are not slippery at all as I had feared before buying them. They feel very well balanced in my hand, and a lot lighter than they look. The sharpness of the edges is almost as good as my Henkel. These are the best Chinese made knives I've ever seen. No defects in my set. I'm very very happy with this purchase."
2,Big disappointment!!,I gave this 2 stars for the design only. The knives aren't sharp at all. They can barely cut an onion. I wasn't happy at all with this set. My cheap Farberware knives are better than these.
2,Sabatier Knife set,"Not pleased with the quality of this knife set. The stainlees steel blades have gotten stains on them that I cannot remove, and the decorative piece on the outside of the scissor handles came off almost immediately."
3,Karloff Commands Your Attention,"Thanks to Edward Dmytryk's atmospheric direction and some truly chilling moments, ""The Devil Commands"" (1941) represents the best of Boris Karloff's ""mad doctor"" series. Compelling performances by Karloff and Anne Revere dominate this low-budget supernatural thriller. Three Stooges fans will enjoy seeing foils Richard Fiske and Kenneth MacDonald in dramatic supporting roles. Along with ""The Black Room"" (1935), Karloff's most memorable work for Columbia Pictures."
5,Boris Karloff At His Best,"Awesome and terror-inspiring would sum up my thoughts on this movie. I had many a bad dream as a child growing up in the '50s and '60s after seeing this movie, and it still reaches out to grab me. Of course, few could inspire sheer terror as Mr. Karloff could.Not gory or bloody, but a nightmare-creating monster, nonetheless."
1,Just okay,"I had a car full of 6-year old boys and they played with this thing for about 10 minutes and were done. After moving the car around a couple times on the track, there's just not much to do..."
4,Book,It came fairly quick. It was brand new like the title said and it was in excellent shape for what they said.
1,Disappointed,"I bought this drive last fall. Since then, it I have had to send it in for repairs TWICE. While still covered under warranty, it has been extremely inconvenient to send it in (and I have had to pay shipping costs out of my pocket each time). I have no confidence that it will not break down again. I would not recommend that anyone purchase this drive."
4,Series completion,"Our son had some of this series and wanted the rest. We appreciate the great service and the prompt delivery. It arrived on time and was used for a gift. Thanks, R Tatton"
2,NEW!,"Once again, I was looking for hard cover editions, but the brand new editions are very disappointing. Linda"
3,I'd Give It 2 1/2 Stars if I Could,"Meh, nothing over-the-top or outrageous about this. Actually, pretty boring and bland. Too bad, because it could have been a really great novel. Instead it's just an okay read. This is a borrow not buy kind of book."
1,tedious and trivial,"What made this book yesteryear's succes fou? Beats me. Shallow characters, empty lives. If you must read McInerney, try Last of the Savages instead."
3,a loss cause,"This book was an easy read in that you follow a man's life spiral downward to the bottom of the barrel after a marriage breaking up. If you have seen the movie, it closely resembles the storyline. Yet, you expect him to pull it out at the end of the book. You almost feel bad for him because of the problems he has at work, with friends and his marriage. But, I said almost"
1,Fluff,"""Bright Lights, Big City"" is notable only for its second-person narrative, a device that would have been interesting in the hands of a more skilled author; with McInerney, however, it comes off as little more than a cute trick. This book somehow manages the feat of reflecting the shallowness of 80s yuppie culture without offering a single perceptive observation about it. Indeed, this may be the only book ever written specifically for shallow yuppies who have never read a book and will never read another one. The main character's ""rebirth"" at the end is trite beyond belief. (He walks past a bakery and smells bread. It smells ""wholesome,"" so he trades in a yuppie status symbol for a loaf and eats it, thus saving his soul. Get it?) The great modern American novel about a young man at war with himself in the Big City remains ""The Catcher in the Rye."" This book isn't a tenth of Salinger's masterpiece."
5,A great effort,I read this book last week after putting it off and loved it. A great read about 80's yuppie lifestyle of a guy who doesn't really enjoy it. Written in the second person it makes it seem as if you are living the life of the lead character.
2,"With all of the hype, I expected more.","I saw the movie and have several friends who thought the book was ""the best"" or ""the coolest"". As far as one more book about self indulgent, self destructive, pseudo-intellectuals - it's ok, but enough is enough. I just didn't find the subject worthy of my or anyone's time. The writing is merely adequate. If you are stuck on a plane it's not a bad killer of time, but only worth a check out from the library, not a buy/keeper. What's the story with the rumor the ex-wife in the book is based on a real life model/actress?"
3,CONFUSING,"Trying to read a book in second person is extreamly hard. Expesially when you dont even know the main characters name. This book was not very well organized and seamed to be scrambled at times. Althought following the life of a Manhattan cocain adict is ammusing, reading in second person can be complicated at times."
2,Unimpressive,"This is an iconic American novel? Seriously? In that case, fans of this book must be used to reading mediocre crap. ""Bright Lights, Big City"" is about depressed, shallow, pathetic yuppies embracing drugs and sex in New York City during the 1980s. The second person narrative is interesting, and the author does a good job of portraying the unnamed narrator's sense of desperation and hopelessness. However, that's all that the book really delivers. There's nothing groundbreaking here, and there's nothing likable about any of the characters in the book. The ending is very cliche, and for the life of me I just do not understand why so many people rave about this stupid book! It is no ""Catcher in the Rye,"" that's for sure. Skip this one."
3,"Competent Writing, an Amusing Slice of the 80's","Short book that goes by quickly.Well-crafted but curiously hollow story of a yuppie trying to make it in New York's tough publishing world. Characters ring true, but few were sympathetic.I liked it well enough, at about the same intellectual level that I enjoy reading Vanity Fair magazine. So if you are looking for an entertaining read that will not make you worry about important issues, I would say, ""go ahead and read it."""
4,"Witty, not funny.","I found this book to be frustrating and sad. At first, I thought the unnamed main character was your typical yuppie who is caught up in Manhattan's fast paced, drug induced night life because that is what young, unattached adults do. But then you find out all the bad things that have happened in his life. The drug induced night life made more sense. It was his way of coping with his loses. I thought the writing was clever. Maybe too clever. Some reader's found humor in it. There were some witty parts. ""Tad's mission in life is to have more fun than anyone else in New York City, and this involves a lot of moving around, since there is always the likelihood that where you aren't is more fun than where you are."" I wouldn't classify this book as ""funny"" however. I think the writer found an interesting way of describing how a young guy, living in a fast paced world of the 80's, is dealing with loss and loneliness."
4,Flash,McInerney appears to have had one brilliantly written book in him about a jerk who is totally lacking in character. I suppose it's good that someone created this portrait. Now let's move on.
4,Stylistically Smart,"It should be read, if only for the technical skill used in creating it.The fact that I found it tragically hilarious and reminiscent of certain friends was also a plus. A useful antidote to the ""Friends"" vision of New York City life."
4,Not Just an 80's Relic,"I am aware McInerney has kind of gone out of fashion (so '80's, don't you know) but this book remains funny, wise, and endearingly satirical about the eternal vices. And that's what's supposed to last, isn't it? This first novel relies heavily for its tone on good old F. Scott Fitzgerald, but the second-person narration is a brilliant story-telling strategy--it sucks ""you"" right in to the narrator's world. (For another great novel that uses ""you"" a lot, see Robert O'Connor's chilling ""Buffalo Soldiers."")"
2,disappointing,"you pick up this book, written in the 2nd person, and you read it. you're amused by some of the episodes and you hope that they all lead somewhere, but they don't. you reach the final chapter and suddenly realise that you've lived, so to speak, through a week of a life of a carciogenically boring person. you eke out a measure of revenge by writing this review for amazon dot com."
2,Great if you want a childrens book,"This is the first Dummies book I have not liked....More for raising rabbits for children. Small scale, not a book for agriculture purposes."
1,Strictly a pet book.......,"Not what I was looking for - strictly about rabbits as pets, no mention about their use as livestock.Overall, one of the worst of the ""Dummy"" series books that I've ever seen."
1,Dummies Who Bought This Rabbit Book,"This book is just terrible. Absolutely dreadful. It is the Touchy Feely Bunny Book. However, it will make good firewood for the winter."
5,Great for novices,"I bought this book for my sister, who just got her first rabbit. We were dazzled by the fabulous range of information provided by this book. Pay especial attention to the extensive appendices -- invaluable!"
2,Rabbits for Dummies,"This is a good book for house rabbits or those who want basic information but it does not (in my opinion) get deep enough into the differing breeds and their characteristics. And the author seemed biased against the bulk rabbit farmers. I usually find the ""Dummies""series of books to be more informational that this particular book, but it was an easy read and I would advise new rabbits owners to read it as well as other books on the care of rabbits to form their own opinions"
4,Good Reading,Good book. Easy reading for someone who dosn't kow anything about raising rabbits & their habits. A good refeence book for questions.
2,The Pale Horse Review,"This is an ok movie. Because there was to much usless conversation between characters, the important stuff ruined whatever suspence there might of been, and it made the story very confusing."
1,The Lame Horse That Should Have Been Put Down.,"This was quite possibly the most boring movie that i have ever seen in my life. The plot is dry and needs to be moistend with some action. Almost nothing actually happend in this movie and the little bit that did was streached out to last two houurs long. Don't get me wrong I like dramas just as much as I do actions or comedys or lovestories, but this wasn't even a drama! To be considered a drama it must have atleast a little bit of conflict everyone in this movie seemed to get along, and when they didn't they were extremely polite aboout it. If there is one movie that you don't see this year please make it The pale horse, unless you like to sleep,"
2,minidemon's review of the worst movie ever(the pale horse),"This review is on the movie the Pale Horse, which was not the best movie I've ever seen for sure. The acting was a little less than mediocre, the people acted like they were reading right off the script. Second of all, the camera work looked a lot similar to a home video camera if you ask me. This movie is so slow until the very end, this is when the whole thing comes together, which in turn leaves you bored and lost for the entire movie until that point."
1,it [stinks],"In my opinion the movie was terrible. The acting wasn't very good; Mark Easterbrook and Kate Mercer were supposed to be ""dating"" yet there was no passion between them. Also Mark was under suspicion for murder and he was extremely cool and calm. The plot was hard to follow and slow. The inspector's sidekick was trying to help Mark prove his innocence even though the inspector was set on Mark being guilty. Also it isn't very suspense filled or mysterious for being a mystery, I figured out who was doing the murders 30 minutes into the movie. Also for an A&E movie it looked like the cameraman was drunk. And the film was 20 years old. I would give this movie 1 star, if you have to choose between watching this movie and getting hit by a car it would be a close call."
1,"Bad, Sleepy. Just not cool!","The movie was not cool. it was borring and very sleepy. i could not sit threw the first 10 min of this movie. i fell asleep. i could not help it. the story had no story line, and it had no plot that was worth watching. it was not a cool thing to see so all in all do not rent this movie, and do not watch this film."
2,Not worth the time,It was dull and hard to follow. The story line jumped around to much. Not enough acting of the characters. Should have used better actors for the roles.
2,It [isn't good],"The Pale horseA talkative movie. The movie has a very bad plot also. It is very boring. I have to give it a 2.Back in 1996 an author by the name Agatha Christie made this movie out of her book. The book was not that bad, but the movie was very boring.First the plot was kind of a drag along scene. i'd rather sit and watch paint dry, well that is what to expect in watching this movie. The story line was not the greatest, and the characters was not filling up the parts too good either.The movie was about a murder-suspense movie but to me it had no suspense. I did not jump out of my seat at all. The actors was not that good, again they could have done better for the characters. I could not relate to their characters.Honestly I fell asleep during this movie.By DavePassini"
2,It sucked,"The Pale horseA talkative movie. The movie has a very bad plot also. It is very boring.

4,Agatha Christies Pale Horse,"One of the rare Christie stories that does not contain any of her 3 famous protagonists (Marple, Poirot, Tommy & Tuppence). However it is one of her most interesting tales. Well acted, it keeps you guessing all the way. An excellent translation of the original. A must for Christie fans."
3,The Pale Horse,I think that the storyline of this movie was good. After the second time that i watched the movie it proved to run smooth the whole time. The clues as to who it was were kinda blurry but besides that i understood it. The acting wasn't that good but that is ok.
1,NO 3D Effect!,I tried to play the 3D disc on PS3 connected to a Samsung 3D TV but there's simply no 3D effect. I've tried both disc 1 & 2. Is it a compatability issue?
4,I LUV KYLIE,"I loved the dancing, the singing and Kylie herself. I could not watch the 3-D but it's as close as you will get to that.... seeing it in blu-ray."
3,Homoerotic Spectacular!,"Like her music was looking forward to seeing her live via BluRay. Video = 10 Audio = 10 lots of pre-recorded bits but if she was lip syncing I could not tell. Sets were incredible some with water features. Some themes were already done by Destiny's Child but who's counting. What ruined the show was the presence of male anatomy, guys touching guys, butch women, very odd costumes. Some have posted she really knows her audience well and judging from the show her target audience is gay males. Not family or straight friendly."
4,"If You Buy The Lathe, You Should Buy This Stand","Hi,I bought the Jet mini lathe, and then bought this stand about 7 or 8 weeks later. I should have just bought them together.The lathe attaches easily. The stand gets the lathe off the workbench (freeing up valuable space) and puts it at a very comfortable height.I highly recommend it."
5,jet lathe stand,the stand was very easy to asemble and very durable i realy liked the cross brace i built a tool holder thats puts tools right at my finger tips
2,Item not received.,"I have not received this item but was charged for it. I contacted the supplier, they did not ship it (at the time it was not in stock but since then they have it). Not sure what has happened. The supplier said to contact Amazon about the charge but I could not find a phone number to report this issue to Amazon. Seems I am caught in the middle of something. Would really like the product!!! Hope someone helps me soon!!!"
5,Cuddl Duds Camisoles-Good Quality,Best camisole I have ever owned. It is as beautiful as it is comfortable. I will be looking for the brand from now on.
4,great layer,"I love these and wear them almost every day. The only complaint is the lace can itch just a little and only occasionally. I would order the style without the lace trim next time. However, it is pretty when it peeks out of a blouse or out from under a sweater neckline."
3,Warm and stylish,"I have several of these because I really like the v-neck and the lace trim. This is the first I have ordered in ivory, the rest of mine are black or white. The color was disappointing as it is such a light ivory it is hard to tell this one from the white. Also, this one was a little shorter than others of this exact style. Maybe Cuddl Duds has changed the proportions, but I prefer the longer length."
1,The boys are back but with the magic gone!,"It is sad that being a rabid fan of the band I have to write this negative review but unfortunately ""Nouveau Calls"" is of little or no value. Most of the songs are purposeless and boring and can wear you down. This wasn't a comeback album like Deep Purple's ""Perfect Strangers"" but it is a poor attempt at getting the original classic line up to recreate their old magic. Sadly it bombed. There is little in this album that will please the avid Wishbone Ash fan. One aspect even turned me off. The drumming on 'From Soho to Sunset' sounded very similar to Stewart Copeland's (The Police) drumming. No surprise because the album was produced by Stewart's brother Miles Copeland. I also don't think that an all-instrumental album was the right way to go. A couple of songs could have made a big difference. Blame it on poor production, blame it on the boys but this album is not worth it."
1,Also Bummed Out,Beware!! I also Ordered this Instant live cd thinking it was P-Funk and it was not.. None of the songs on the cd were even the same. Also the P-funk cd Was supposed to have 3 cds. I recived a Spearhead Cd and it only has 2 cds. But I didnt even want Spearhead. I wanted P-FUNK!!!!!!!!
1,DON'T BUY,"We received this as a gift and one of the units did not work right out of the box. I was told by the store that I had to return them to the manufacturer. I called them, got the instructions for return, and sent them in for an exchange. That was a year and a half ago. This toy is garbage. Don't waste your money."
2,Total Disappointment,"I'm sorry. After reading Forever and the Night I was looking forward to reading For All Eternity. I really did try, but I couldn't get into it. There was nothing there to keep me interested. I thought the vampire story had some promise, but Calder and Maeve's relationship with him irritated me to the point I put the book down halfway through. No, this one is definitely going in the book exchange pile."
2,Don't waste your time.,"Friends of Ms. Miller must be writing these reviews because I found nothing to enjoy about this book. I was looking in particular for a good vampire book and could not believe that this level of writing was considered excellent by all of you. I'm beginning to think we need some other way to catagorize this type of writing. I for one did not find the plot enthralling or even interesting because the writing level was too elementary. She gets 2 stars for getting published. That was truly an accomplishment. Sorry, just being honest to those who really want to know."
5,The 1st season!,I remember watching this growing up and wanted to get it for my nephew i am very happy with this purchase!
5,5 year old loves it,"My son loves this show and Amazon is the only place it can be found for Roku! We buy a couple every friday for his ""movie night."" My only gripe about how Amazon rents/sells movies and shows is there's not much consistency - rent one, but have to buy another. Weird."
4,Scooby Doo Was A Puppy,"My four year old is Scooby Doo crazy but of all the Scooby DVD's we have, it's the Pup Named Scooby Doo that's the biggest hit. He can watch it by himself as the regular Scooby titles can be slightly scary. The stories are age appropriate and he just loves them. There are ""bad guys"" that add conflict and there are still mysteries to solve but not scary monsters. The mysteries are stories like who stole Fred's bike. When he wants to watch it he asks, ""Can we watch the ones when Scooby Doo was a puppy?"". He is glued to it. I highly recommend for your younger Scooby Doo fan."
4,good for kids,"My soon to be 2 year old boy likes watching this Scooby edition. He fell in love with Scooby on a trip to Universal Studios and though this would be fun. I also purchased the ""What's New Scooby"" version of Scooby but we have not watched that yet.I think the original version of Scooby is better but this is still fun."
3,Not Digital,"I'm sure all of the 'A Pup Named Scooby-Doo' dvds are not digital but we were disappointed when we found out it wasn't. My 2 1/2 year old son loves Scooby Doo and we bought these so we wouldn't have to watch 'What's New Scooby Doo' for the 100th time. These are good cartoons but I recently saw it at Marshall's for $6, which is cheaper than what we got this for."
4,Funny,"This is a very funny & unique cartoon. Based off the original Scooby Doo, where are you? My son like it very much & watched intensely while I took a nap!!"
4,Good but not great.,"I loved this series of Scooby-Doo when I was a kid and so now that my daughter has an obsession with Scooby-Doo I was happy to pick up the ""Pup"" series, season 1 for her. I'm a little disappointed however. There are some significant areas of the DVD transfer that left the animation sketchy. It should be much much clearer than it is. This isn't an issue with my TV or DVD player. Some parts of the show just seem to look like they've been ripped from an AVI. If it wasn't for the low quality DVD transfer I'd have given this a 5 star rating; as it stands now though, it's a 4 star."
2,Cruddy Video Quality,"Wow, this is the worse I have ever seen in video quality, it jumps and flicks and flops, it is unwatchable on a large television. I'm really unhappy that I paid $12 for something that makes me dizzy to watch with my son."
4,Nice but..,"I thought that the set was nice but, it would have been really nice to see some background on the kid actors that voiced Freddy, Velma, and Daphanie. The Transfor was great except for the final toon on the second disc... The sound seemed slow and the anamation seemed slow as well... Minor, but noticable... Bring on the final years WB... Please??? With sugar on the top?"
2,Trips in time,"Are you intrested in the past, or the future? Do you like science fiction? I do not, but if you do, The Time Bike is the book for you. The book is about a boy named, Eddy, who gets a mysterious bike. He doesn't know what kind of bike it is until he sees a clock on it. When he figures that it is a time bike, he uses it many times. I gave this book two stars because I liked some of the adventures that Eddy went on, but not all of them. For example, on one of them, Eddy went back in time to learn about Henry David Thoreau. One of the adventures that I liked was when Elenor (Eddy's sister) had a turn on the bike. I wish that I could go to some of the places they went. I was disappointed that I didn't learn about Mr. Thoreau when Eddy went back in time. I recommend this book to an eleven or twelve year old."
3,Non sequiturs abound,"This book never drew me. Perhaps I'm too removed from southern goth? I didn't find it funny like some. I certainly don't care for religious struggles and the various non sequiturs where he'd bark out churchy comments were only disharmonious to me. I understand that she was showing its magnetic, fatalistic allure to him but instead it just seemed disconnected and without an overarching plot."
4,Very Good,"It was a very good book and I have enjoyed reading it. She is very vivid about her writing; it makes one feel he/she is here. I think it shows the ""unseen"" side of religion"
4,This grotesque parody shows a man's struggle w/ Christ.,I found this book enteraining as well a deep insight into one person's interpretation of a person's struggle with God and Christ.
5,Anyone Who Had a Heart,"This novel combines startling images and an inscrutable Old Testament sensibility with funny scenes that will make you laugh out loud. It is the novel that helped cement Flannery O'Connor's literary reputation. She's a writer who will be part of the canon in a hundred years -- people will still be reading and discussing her. ""Wise Blood"" is the story of Hazel Motes, a man determine to strip Christ out of his life and out of the world, but, who, paradoxically, is also obsessed with Him. A walk through a haunted yet still good world filled with men who are made into monkeys, workaday street preachers, broke down autos, this is a kaleidoscope of sense, doubts, guilt, and humor: a must read tour de force."
5,A novel about Christ in the south.,"This is a unique story that is particularly hard to describe. It revolves around the story of a man who is revolting against Christ, perceiving that to be a revolt against everyone else, only to realize they are just as lost as him. It's the story of several madmen in a society that is Christian in name only. It's a unique story."
3,What a carnival. . .,". . .what a parade. There is one unpleasant character followed by another unpleasant character followed by one even less likable (and more unlikely). Yet this novel of the grotesque--of the pretend gorilla, of the ""Christ without Christ"" church, of the repentant Christian who doesn't believe in repentance or Christianity--makes one think and makes one laugh. I know I won't forget Hazel Motes, even if I prefer not to remember him."
2,I can't sleep with this...,"I assumed that for $15, plus shipping, that this would be a very nice mask. It turned out to be extremely uncomfortable though. The mask itself is black pastic (which is fine), but it has foam around the outside that is cut for a person with a very small head - it never felt quite right since the foam would be really close to my eyes. In order to keep it tight enough to keep it on correctly it would crush my nose so that I couldnt breathe. The strap is made out of velcro, which always rubbed/scratched my ears. I havent been able to fall asleep with this mask on."
2,Cheaply Made,"The mask consists of a heavy cheap piece of black plastic upon which ovals of foam rubber have been added to cover but not touch the eyes. How can they charge $15 !!!! Probably works reasonably well if you're leaning back on an aircraft, but if you turn your head slightly while lying in bed, the large plastic edge begins to push the mask away from your eyes. I next bought the large blue sleepmaster mask and very highly recommend it for larger face coverage than the standard masks and its softness + no elastic."
4,Mindfolds work very well,The Mindfolds were delivered earlier than I was informed on purchase. I love Mindfolds and I'm very happy with this order.
1,OVERPRICED!!!!!!,"If I were to give an honest appraisal of this item,I would would say it had a value of about five dallars!!! (at most)"
2,"Blocks the light, but NOT very comfortable !","This mask totally blocks the light, this is the good thing. The bad thing is that it's made of plastic at the top so it's not comfortable to sleep while wearing it. it might be useful for a nap in a car or a plane, as long as you are sitting still."
3,"Works well, comfortable, but not perfect","It does block out light very well and doesn't press at all on the eyes, but the mask part has unfinished edges - which can cause scratches - and doesn't fit flush. If you sleep on your back and don't move a lot, this would be a good choice. If you tend to sleep on your side or stomaach, or you have company in bed, this might not be the best choice.It is fairly durable though, and since it doesn't press on the eyes, it's an excellent choice if you wear contacts to bed."
1,Could injure eyes,"The black plastic is hard and sharp and could easily injure eyes. It is probably great for meditation,and anyone who sleeps only on their back, but in my opinion too dangerous for anyone who does not."
2,Cheap Plastic with Foam Cutout,"This is just a piece of plastic with a piece of foam glued to it. The foam has cutouts for the eyes, so you'll get good blackout when using it. Ergonomics are poor, and it oozes cheapness. So, practical and useful, but not very nice looking. I keep it in an end table drawer for occasional use in the living room on the sofa."
2,MINDFOLD,"Glad I didn't pay the full price of around $20 from the Mindfold website. I paid $12 w/free shipping on Amazon but still think that is a bit much. I Love the concept of opening your eyes in total darkness but this product is pretty cheap. I agree with one review stating that they could've went to a crafts store and made their own. Other than being overpriced, the only issue I have is that the strap is uncomfortable around the ears. Definately not for sleeping(unless you're on your back all night) but good for meditation.NOTE: Depending on the size of your nose some light may still seep through."
2,Flimsy...looks like a child's craft project,"I was incredibly disappointed in the quality of this mask. It's basically a cutout of flexible black plastic backed by a foam cutout that sits between the plastic and your face. The shipping cost was outrageous...almost as much as the cost of the mask itself. I wanted to return it, but the cost of the total shipping would have exceeded the cost of the mask itself, so I kept it. Do not make the same mistake. You can easily recreate this in a craft store for about $1.95."
5,Mind relaxation Mask,I love this mask. It has room for your eyes to open without squashing down your eyelashes and making it feel uncomfortable. Great mask for sleeping and relaxing!
4,Good enough,"While this product does what it claims; it just doesn't get as cold as the cold pack product I used previously. However the ""cloth-like"" exterior is very nice."
3,Nice,"This is the first brother Cadfael book I read and it was one the better ones. I liked the plot and the mystery, however I thought the ending was a bit syruppy."
4,Safe from the Mob,"A troubadour seeks sanctuary in the church from a mob who want to hang him for murder in this medieval mystery THE SANCTUARY SPARROW by Ellis Peters. Father Cadfael befriends the young man, helps him to unit with his love, and discovers a murderer hiding outside the church.Nash Black, author of QUALIFYING LAPS."
4,Very fun read!,"If you are a person that just wants to enjoy a fun book and likes historical mystery's, this book is for you. Similar to ""The Name of the Rose"" in context, but much easier to understand! (although ""The Name of the Rose"" is great also) I would recommend this book to anyone. Reads very quick and characters are understandable. Have fun!"
1,ONE LOUSY PRINT,"It's a shame that this DVD of one of Jane Fonda's sexiest films has been struck from a badly deteriorated master. The print is grainy and distorted, lacking clarity in focus. Also, compare this print to the earlier VHS version and you will discover that there are key shots missing from this French language version.If this film can't be restored to the rich textures I recall from the original, then consider THE GAME IS OVER one lost film. The product available for purchase here is completely worthless, making its high price of $39.00 ludicrous. It ought to be yanked off the market."
2,Disappointed,"I had forgotten how lame this Roger Vadim effort was. It's only redeeming value in its original form (for those of us who enjoyed it) was a generous amount of young Jane Fonda nudity. Unfortunately, this heavily edited version retains little of that, and not much else worthwhile."
2,Is this a density meter or moisture meter?,"I've been in the hardwood flooring business for 30 years and didn't use any meters until about 10 years ago. I have used the Lignomat pin meter and have had pretty good success with it. Butit doesn't read a very large area, but does tell the moisture in that area. I went to the MMC220 to avoid the pin holes and had heard raves about it.The MMC220 tells you the density of the wood but is very confusing when trying to tell the moisture.The Lignomat tells you the moisture, the MMC220 gives wide variations in the density which confuses the real moisture level"
5,MMC220,"Excellent product. I have been installing hardwood flooring and found this meter to have been an excellent purchase. Coupled with an accurate atmospeheric moisture meter makes for trouble free installations when you know the wood will not expand or contract due to a mis-match in RH during the installation.Not having ""pins"" is a real plus for pre-finished flooring and I can check product before I recieve it from my suppliers."
4,Gripping page turner,"A great first novel that will have you unable to put it down. With every turn of the page you can't believe the depths someone will go to cover up a misdeed and moreover, you don't want to stop reading! Well-written, engaging and entertaining, Darkness in Him hits a nerve for anyone who ever thought what might happen if..."
4,Excellent for a debut....,"I was a little skeptical about reading this at first but once I started...I could not stop! Some parts made me squirm and It might have been a little too ""brutal"" for my liking...BUT I have to say Andrew Lyons did a great job for a debut...I would highly recommend this book to anyone who loves a suspense/thriller...I lost a whole day and a nights sleep...I just had to turn the next page...."
2,"Fast read, little substance","It's true that Andrew Lyons has written a fast-paced little thriller. But there's very little meat on the skeletal story and even less on the flimsy characters.A simple accident becomes a murder when Jake finishes the job. But then he's suddenly transformed from frat-rat to stealthy psychopath. Perhaps we're supposed to believe he had this ""darkness in him"" all along, but we get no references of his history or prior antisocial behavior. Thus his sudden transformation is hard to take seriously, and his subsequent acts of murder, extortion, etc., are hard to swallow.In the end, the book reads like a shallow, vain, attempt to emulate Brett Easton Ellis' ""American Psycho"". But Lyons' cast of drunken frat boys, promiscuous sorority girls, and overbearing detectives are dull cliches and thoroughly uninteresting."
2,"So far, so good.",I've only been using this off and on for two weeks so it seems to be doing okay. I will update it as I try it more consistently and for a longer period of time.EDIT: After using the entire bottle I can say the only thing I got was a stomach ache.
5,The good stuff,"This contains the natural form of vitamin E Tocopherols (d-alpha, d-beta, d-gamma, d-delta). Do not buy cheaper products that use the dl-alpha, etc tocopherols as they are synthetic forms of Vitamin E and can cause more harm than good. not all vitamin E's are the same.the only thing that could make this better is if it also contained the same mix (alpha, beta, gamma, delta) of the Tocotrienol family of vitamin E (yes, there are 8 members of the vitamin E family). I have yet to find a cost-effective version of vit E that contains all 8."
1,A children's book gone horribly wrong...,"Even though it has been years since I tried to read this tome it still haunts me. No, not because it was scary. Far from it in fact. Because it is so bad. This might have made a good children's book; if not for the discussions of political matters. Or it might have been a good social drama; if not for the meaningless addition of demons.All in all this is a pathetic attempt to rip-off Frank Peretti's work. It is neither scary, nor insightful. The only thing frightening about this book is the grammatical structure and punctuation errors.EDIT: I don't know why Amazon says I reviewed the audio-cassette version. I had the misfortune to read the paperback instead."
5,An eye opener,"I live a couple miles from a city where a situation like what happened in Tamarind actually occurred. At the time, I was angry with the person who caused the cross to come down. But after reading Tamarind, I realize more than ever that we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Thank you, Swanee, for the reminder. Looking forward to the sequel."
5,an eye-opening look into the spiritual realm,"I'm not a religious person, but I do like to read about spiritual matters. TAMARIND, though a novel - and I respect it as just that - instilled some thought provokers into my brain. It made me do research into scriptures that I might not have, otherwise, engaged in. And it revealed characteristics about ""men of the cloth"" that I easily recognize as true and not fiction. I think this book is for people who look past religion and ""see"" (or want to see) into the spiritual world."
5,wife loves it,"my wife hs been using it for 10 years now - loves it. She just does not want to change it, and i Agree."
5,Best scent,"I always love the scent, very mild and long lasting. I love this item because it includes not only the parfum, but the pocket size parfum and lotions."
5,The best utters album,"Ok, this is by far the best Utters album. All the others are classics too, but if you had to get one, this is the one.--Snot!"
2,Not impressed,"Roger Whittaker is an amazing talent. I wish I had tried for the live in Berlin DVD instead of this one - it's poor at best. The set is dark and moody, yet Roger Whittaker is lively and personable on the stage - doesn't match. He does a couple moody songs (like, Send in the Clowns), but the rest of the songs don't match the set. Not only that, but I have high-def and the picture is poor/blurry - second rate. I thought the concert would be stuffed with songs he is famous for; I was disappointed."
1,Paranoid,"I felt from the start he was so full of himself, paranoid, condensending. How can so many people be against this man. He is his own worst enemy."
3,Three Coins In A Fountain,"Libby Waldron wished to marry...anyone but the groom handpicked by her small-town, wedding crazed Texas familiy!Ethan Redwine needed a nanny for his two precocious kids - could Libby convince the marriage shy millionaire to take a temporary wife? With Ethan's children on her side, she just might charm him into matrimony. But as Libby gazed into Ethan's warm brown eyes, she started wishing forever could be part of the vows...."
5,HP90 Printhead w/cleaner DEAL!,I purchase supplies for hundreds of employees and this product was reasonable and the delivery was outstanding. Great Deal all the way around.
5,Nice Product,I received this product very promptly. It fit my vaccumm cleaner eureka multipath cyclonic system with HEPA filter pretty well. Will recommend this buy.
2,Broke within a few seconds of a jam,"These were delivered in a nondescript package, not in the factory packaging shown in the photo on the product page. I installed one of the belts with a brand new beater/roller brush, and all seemed to be fine. On the third use of the vacuum cleaner, I snagged a bit of cloth that jammed the roller, and although I reacted fairly quickly to switch it off, the belt was quickly eaten through. I have jammed this machine in a similar way in the past with no discernible damage to the belt. I think I will stick to real brand-name belts from now on."
2,Update,"I noticed my Eureka vacuum stopped picking up small pieces of thread or lint from the carpet, even tho it seemed to be vacuuming fine otherwise. The belt looked allright, but once I replaced it there was a big improvement. Belts are inexpensive so I plan to replace it yearly. If you do a lot of vacuuming, you may need to replace it every six months.UPDATE: These belts break far too often, therefore I changed my rating from 5 stars down to 2. I don't have much carpeting to vacuum, no pets in the house, and no children living at home..still the first belt broke after only 6 weeks and the second one after 2 months."
4,Fits and works,"I bought a belt from Ace Hardware and it broke after two weeks. These have yet to break. If it breaks in the near future, I'll update and give a lower rating.Update:After four months, both of them broke. It's probably my Vacuum and not the fault of the belt. Reducing to four stars."
4,does the job,smells a little but that i figure comes from the fact that the rubber is rubbing against bare metal.Does what it has to do and i am fine with that.
4,recommend,"fast shipping, product work fine, my new vacuum cleaner parts supplier! i have a eureka contour model no longer made. parts and acc. hard to find they had it . I wish i knew about this company before i ordered more items from a more expensive company who had to back order. it took 3 weeks to get them. ezvacuum company has fast free shipping and great prices. thanks"
5,Great Value...,"I bought the two pack of belts here on Amazon for my Eureka Upright because they are so much cheaper than in store. That being said, I didn't know what to expect - many times when they are that cheap, the belts are not ""OEM"" and as such do not match up. I was pleasantly surprised to find that no only are they ""OEM"", they were a perfect and direct fit for my vacuum. I recommend buying a few two packs just to keep around as your belts wear out or break."
2,Glad you get a 3-pack....they break easily.,"They are cheap and come in 3-packs. That's the pro. Don't know why but the first one installed broke after its first use. I can't find any real cause for it. If the rubber is getting old, this would increase the frequency of breakdowns. Still, it's cheaper to replace a belt than to go buy a new vacuum cleaner."
3,well..,"This dvd was so so. the production was kinda jacked up due to all the generational dubbing. the over all dvd is informative, but it wasn't all what i thought it would be. decent info for the beginner to help them find their true magickal level."
2,Ugh,"I have been purchasing a few of the ""Hard Case Crime"" books here and there to get a look at some different writers, and because these seemed to be like the books I grew up with. This title just did not measure up in my opinion. The plot was transparent and the prose was turgid. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
4,Wings,"A nostalgic, innocent, funny television at its best. Too bad that delivery problems harmed the exprience."
5,Freedom,"The Twevle Girls Band is exqusite and beautiful! Their talent and versatility of music well take you on a magical journey. Girls don't stop playing, keep playing those extraordinary and historical instruments your music is wonderful. I can't wait too have the opportunity to see you girls live. This CD is must buy if you like the Twelve Girls Band.Or music with soul, devotion and body. The world is waiting to see and hear your music. The music is crisp, clean and refreshing. They Rock!"
3,Pass the chopstix and get out that game of GO!,"It's TAKE-OUT night! My daughter turned me on to these gals when I was looking for music to go with my Mongolian Hot Pot party. Very talented group each playing their instrument masterfully. The music is so intricate and every instrument resonates with the others. Clear, beatiful sound. How can I describe it? Maybe sort of an Asian Mannheim Steamroller. All instrumental. I love it. Very high energy. I would love to see them live. Go Girls!"
4,Building a Church,"This was our first 3d puzzle and man was it an education! First and most important is the instruction book. READ THE INSTRUCTIONS! If you don't you are in for a world of hurt. Second, be patient. You will not put this puzzle together quickly. Third, bring a friend. We found that it sometimes took 2 people to hold the thing together. All that being said it was a fun project and we will order more 3d puzzles. The completed puzzle really looks like the picture and the illumination really adds to the over-all effect."
1,Tripe,This movie was shot without a script...and it shows. Terrible acting makes it even worse. I was hoping for something along the lines of FUNNY GAMES or WITH FRIENDS LIKE HARRY but what I got was something unfit for public access tv. I'm sure the director thought his edits were hip and artsy too but they only compound the problems. Worthless tripe.
1,Horrilble!,"They kept playing this movie on Sundance just like they keep playing those annoying commercials for products on late night infomercials. I watched it in bits and pieces and I can't recall a more worthless film. I've seen episodes of the OC with better talent, direction and dialogue."
3,3-1/2 stars. Independent movies are alive and well...,"An engrossing yet somewhat leaden independent film about a married couple whose lives are complicated by an encounter with a moody young hitchhiker, whose brusque ways attract the anxious wife, and spur jealous petulance within the heart of her distracted yuppie husband. The entire production, from script to shooting, has a pungent aroma of film-schoolishness -- many scenes falter and the performances don't always connect; the writing inclines predictably through scene after scene, and the ending, while surprising, seems forced and feels unsatisfying. This being said, it's still nice to see that independent cinema, with all its flaws and foibles, is still alive and well and making it into our lives. Worth checking out, though you could also just as easily skip it."
5,"Katterskill Falls, ummmmm","This film has it all. Great characters, intrigue, beautiful texture and a good story. Watch it on a rainy day."
5,Excellent merchandise,Excellent merchandise delievered quickly. I have no more words to say so am typing to fulill minimum word requirements.Y
2,Inappropriate Title ; Average Book,"The title ""Understanding Urban Unrest: From Reverend King to Rodney King"" is indeed unfortunate. The Reverend Dr. Martin Luther KingJr.received the Nobel Peace Prize and has a national holiday in his honor. Rodney King was a nobody until he found himself in the wrong place at the wrong time until a video camera made him an instant media hero. The author's placement of these two together in hi title is an indication of his lack of sensitivity to the core issues facing America's urban underclass.But the book goes downhill from there. The author spends too much time criticizing the civil rights leadership while minimizing the continuing impact of institutional racism.While acknowledging the lack of comprehensive social policy planning, this author gives no real clue as to why this absence of planning occured in the past and why it is still taking place now.R"
3,Adequate But Uninspired Chess Story,"In ""Queen's Gambit,"" Walter Tevis tries to do for the world of chess what he did for pool in ""The Hustler."" The descriptions of the chess games are fascinating, as are the personalities of some of the contestants. But the heroine lacks the appeal of Fast Eddie Felson, and the conclusion is flat. In marked contrast to ""The Hustler,"" which teaches both Fast Eddie and the reader about the real meaning of winning and losing, the heroine in ""Queen's Gambit"" learns little except to play better chess. This leaves the reader with a feeling akin to stalemate: not a bad novel, but you don't feel like a winner when you finish it."
1,Loser,"Tevis says he's a Class C chess player, but his writing falls below patzer level. A slow mover, with many cliches of plot and style. Major disappointment!"
5,Queen's Gambit,"This book wins the award for ""richest portrayal of an inner life with least use of internal monologue or dialogue"".Marvelously written, this is an uncommonly insightful and rich page turner with an unforgettable protagonist."
4,Just as I remembered.,"I first read this as a (much) younger man about 15 years ago. For some reason the ending stuck in my mind. I was interested to see if was as I remembered and it was! This is not an amazing read, but it is gripping, and the chess descriptions are certainly believeable for the amateur. Well worth some couch time."
4,Dark Fiction - Chess Related,"Tevis is probably the best author to ever write fiction on chess. His talents were tremendous. I read this book - had a tough time putting it down and enjoyed it very much. However, it was very dark and at times not realistic. The whole story revolves around a young girl that is blessed with chess genius and with it the drive to be the best in the world. Her personal life though is a wreck - drugs, anxiety and trouble. This is her adventure and it is quite an interesting and unique journey. If you play or like chess you will love this book. If you're not into chess at all - Tevis is a great writer and should hold your interest, but the story is dark. Other Chess Fiction that is very good is ""The Luneberg Variation"" by Maurensig, ""Alekhine's Anguish"" by Yaffe, ""The Chess Team"" by Sawaski and ""The Royal Game"" by Zweig."
4,More than just chess,"Enjoyed this book that is just as much about a young girl growing up than it is about chess. The girl is a little ""different"", kind of a loner, and you can't help but want her to succeed at chess and at life."
4,Adventures of a Stalwart Heroine,The saga of Amanda Humperdink continues. You need to read the first book in order to enjoy this one the most. A quirky and engaging heroine overcomes terrific odds to emerge victorious. A great read!
4,a small review,"Now the only song ive heard off of this cd so far is a song called Heavy hitters. If the whole cd is like the first single then its gonna be Sick as hell. This is some true rap, and the people in this song are straight from Portland. I guess this cd will have artists from up and down the west coast such as E-40 mac dre, cool nutz, Mr D.O.G. and lots of others."
4,"Six Feet Under, Season 4","After the third season ""sagged"" somewhat, I was thrilled to see new story lines in season four. I absolutely LOVE this seris and although I have watched through episode 9 in final season five, I keep putting off watching the final two episodes so as not to have it over."
4,This season runs the gamut,"Not every episode was great, but it is still a statisfying series. David and Keith finally become a couple without the extremes in their personalities dominating the scenes. Finally their faults are more normal and not way out there like Keith's anger and David's self destruction tendencies. Nate is still self centered but at least Brenda has grown up. Claire is starting down the wrong path at least she has some self awareness. The show has always had bad episodes and very good ones. The characters are always engaging though so I would recommend this show if you like character driven shows."
2,This show has gotten stupid,"We really enjoyed season one and two, liked season three pretty well so we were excited to receive season four. It just has gotten lame. I don't know if the writers have changed but the fourth season is overly contrived and implausible. The characters have become caricatures of themselves and I no longer loom forward to the next episode. We will probably not finish the series out."
5,The best HBO Series Ever!!!,Love Love Love this show this season completed our ownership of the series. I can watch them all over and over again such a great show!
5,Super service,"I couldn't have been happier with the delivery, the price and the condition of this product. It arrived in plenty of time to be wrapped as a birthday present!"
3,Los resagos de Lisa,"Esta cuarta sesión de seis pies bajo tierra, no alcanza a proyectar la fuerza de las dos primeras temporadas de la Serie. El fantasma del personaje de Lisa continua enseñorandose sobre la trama, contagiando a los capitulos con una letargico y opresivo enfoque. La obseción que apriciona a Nate por la muerte de su esposa es poco creible, generando un conflicto ficticio que no logra convencer a los televidentes. Se pierde el interes al naufragar en el tortuoso mundo de Nate, para después descubrir que Lisa eera un ser humanos capaz de sucumbir a la tentación de la Carne como cualquier ser humano.Salva a la temporada el capitulo donde David es secuestrado y cambia su perpectiva de la vida al ser golpeado por la violencia. Y por momentos resulta interesante la lucha de clare por encontrar su identidad, en un mundo de impactos de la egolatria de los seudo artístas."
2,More zombies,"I believe the producers of this show need ""counseling"", or whatever it is that Brenda becomes magically able to dispense. SFU is now so blatantly transgressive it's become laughable. The show has become a never-ending rant against American culture (patriarchism, conventional morality, pursuit of happiness) peopled by soulless zombies who stumble from wreck to wreck in search of who knows what. Happiness is never depicted, never aspired to and honored only in the breach.Guys, we have all been burned! Play past it."
4,Are you better off dead?,"When David is taken hostage and raped repeatedly, it shows that it can happen to anyone. But the PTSD that he suffers is very realistic, and makes one think that he might be thinking he was better off dead. When he told Keith he didn't want him to accompany him to confront his attacker, that was the turning moment. Then he confronts his attacker, and comes out appearing to be stronger for doing it."
4,Pleasantly weird,"Classic Pedro Almodovar movie. Dark and strangely funny. Not as commercial or light as ""Woman on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown"", but still entertaining. Almodovar uses the usual stable of actors and they don't disappoint. I love Carmen Maura's acting choices. Always unexpected. Movie is in Spanish with English subtitles. If you like this and/or want to see another GREAT Spanish film, check out the South American film ""Destiny has no Favorites"""
4,El retorno del dragon,"Definitivamente, vale la pena la lucha entre Bruce Lee y Chuck Norris en el coliseo romano. Me parecio espectacular, esta pieza debe ser de coleccion de todo fan de cine."
2,Chuck Norris fights Bruce Lee?,"A few things are obvious from the start, the movie is boring except for the few martial art scenes. I get the feeling that Bruce Lee is putting-down Karate, this starts when a Karate student is easily beaten by a boxer (one punch), then at the end of the movie Chuck Norris (Karate world champion) is easily beaten by Bruce Lee. There is no way the Chuck Norris would have been so easily beaten if the fight was real. Until Chuck Norris enters the movie the movie is boring. I also think if Chuck Norris had seen the final movie he may never had been part of it. The movie appears to be an attempt by Bruce to advertise his Chinese Boxing, while putting down Karate at the same time. The worst acting/plot I have ever seen."
3,beating up on people as an art form?,"Sent by ""Uncle"" to rescue the young lady who owns a Cantonese restaurantin Rome, Ah Lung Tang finds that he doesn't know the languageand some of the customs puzzle him,like when he is picked off the street by an Italian girl.There is a sub-theme of love between Ah Lung and the restaurant ownerthat is never really developed.Mostly the movie is about beating up gangsters who are trying to get the restaurant property.Finally an American Kung Fu ( actually kick boxing) master is brought in.As his next to the last movie, this is Bruce Lee's style pieceand for that is probably a classic no matter how bad the plot and dialog are.Some of the characterizations are very badly done."
4,Second best Lee flick barely,"I have always liked Chinese Connection a little more than this movie, but Return of the Dragon takes second best for me because of one reason, the epic battle between Bruce and Chuck. It was a fight scene for the ages. The movie is worth owning just for the fight, even if you are not a Bruce Lee fan. Although, the karate rivalry in the story was pretty cool too."
4,Good film.,"I enjoyed this film a lot. Not much of a story,but not many martial arts films of that era had deep story lines. Great fighting scenes and lee is incredible as always. The fights against chuck norris and the hired thugs at the end are excellent. Not as good as enter the dragon,but a great film. Buy this film."
5,powerful from start to finish,will be watching this classic action martial arts movie more times then I can count over the days and yearstruly will stay a classic 90 years from nowthe whole cast is brilliantthe movie is amazingat how action packed it staysand still moves you and helps you understand the story behind itI am glad i saw this on vhs 3 times. and am glad I got it on dvd less then 8 months ago.
2,way of the dragon (1972),"At present i have only the uncut australian release of 'way ofthe dragon' on VHS which runs for 94 mins. What im asking is thisUSA version completely uncut with the Norris/Lee duel,thenunchuku scene are they intact?david ewen, Adelaide,South Australia"
2,Way of the Dragon Blu Ray,Disappointing really. Transfer to Blu Ray is average. Sound transfer is awful. Better to play the collectors edition in ordinary DVD on a Blu Ray player than this one. Disappointing.
4,Bruce takes charge of his Films,"While I very much like this action/comedy, it isn't the best of Bruce's films. The story and comedy are very old hat but his fight scenes(especially with Norris at the Coliseum) are as good as ever put on screen! It shows that along with the footage shot for ""Game Of Death"" that Lee Would have made a gifted director and writer had he lived."
4,One of Bruce Lee's finest films!,"Return of the Dragon aka Way of the Dragon is one of Bruce Lee's best movies. Lee is sent to Rome, when a gang is terrorizing a family friends restaurant. The gang basically tries to force the restaurant owner to sale his establishment buy harassing him daily, a clearing the customers out. When Lee arrives the odds start to change for the gang,the restaurant owner and crew decide to stand up to the gang, and not sale. Once Lee beats the crap out of the whole gang they have to bring in multiple guys to try to defeat Lee. Finally we are left with a showdown between Lee and Chuck Norris. Return of the Dragon is full of good humour and great action, and is a must for all Bruce Lee fans and Action and Martial Arts fans as well."
4,Report About Return of the Dragon,"This was a good film to watch but when I saw the movie,I found out that some fight sequences were edited out of the film for an example,when Bruce done a kick or a punch editors would just cut it out and only show the uncut version to a certain country such as America.I am so angry that don't show it all,they just simply cut and cut and completely ruin the film and they also cut nunchaku scenes that Bruce made. I'm sure that Bruce would agree with me if he were still living today."
4,EXCELLENT example of Bruce Lee,"not much review for this is needed. i mean its bruce lee! with an thrilling end fight scene with chuck norris! bruce lee shows once again who will always be the king of martial arts movies. very good sound and picture quality compared to other versions. SP mode. (Amizon also put this review up for <i>Bruce Lee: The Master Collection Set</i> DVD set, however it only refers to this movie.)"
4,Classic Battle,"The Chinese Connection is by far my favorite movie by Bruce for the fight sequences. However, the fight sequence between Bruce and Chuck Norris is Classic. I still consider it to be one of the best fight sequences between two individuals."
4,Some cutted parts but it's OK !,"This is the last CHINESE movie that Lee did, before Enter the Dragon. In this movie Lee really showns (in my opinion) 2 things, his art (putting a spet forward when talking about SPEED !) and his phisic. At that time his training by himself, it'd make any Schzenegger get furious. His physical fitness is the best I've ever seen ... And his speed, own MAN ! But how can someone be that fast, that lighting with the legs ... But the movie has some cutted parts. For the ones who have seen the movie before should remeber about this parts: The one in which Lee doesn't know how to ask for a little boy some of his ice cream and he runs away (Lee scared him), the one in which Lee doesn't know how to ask for food in the Restaurant and keeps going to the toilet then, and the one in which a prostitute takes Lee to her apartment while Lee keeps doing some kung fu moviements in front of a mirror. But don't worry. THE FIGHTING SEQUENCES ARE ALL THERE AND COMPLETE."
3,Get the proper versions of this film,"I give it 3 stars only because it is the cut-down version of ""The Way of the Dragon"". The original gets 4.5 stars.If you are going to buy the DVDs go for either the European release or the versions now available here in Australia. Firstly there is ""Way Of The Dragon - Platinum Edition (2 Disc Set)"" and ""Bruce Lee - 30th Anniversary Collection"" (6 Disc Box Set) is available soon containing ""Fist of Fury"", ""The Big Boss"", ""The Way of the Dragon"" and 2 disc version of ""Game of Death"" plus a bonus disc. These are full uncut widescreen versions of the film. Why they ever released the edited version is beyond me. All of the Lee movies are now available here in their original uncut widescreen glory with bonus disc."
1,Where Is Chuck Norris the messenger !,"Enter the (CUT) Dragon! I wanted to give this DVD o stars but wouldn't let me. This 25th anniversary DVD is CUT, missing footage, Chuck Norris is missing in action! God knows what else is missing (The Trailer). WB please release the UNCUT version on DVD, overseas has has it! Waste of my money!"
5,Best martial arts movie ever!!!,"If you are a Bruce Lee fanatic you must add this to your collection. This has to be one of the greatest martial arts movie ever. Bruce Lee is in my opinion the greatest martial arts master of all time. Bruce Lees performance in this film is awesome. All sorts of martial arts maneuvers ar shown. Also Chuckie Norris is included in this film, where at the ending of the movie he must battle with Lee but you will have to purchase the movie in order to see who wins :). All through the movie he shows us a fantastic array of fighting. He must fight several opponents which are mediocre in martial arts but they are no match for Bruce Lee. Sorry I cannot describe to you the specifics of the movie since I have no words to describe such a great movie especially on DVD with the high quality in picture format. All I have to say is just buy the movie and you wont regret it."
2,way of the dragon,"I love this movie,but you have to read it instead of watch it,cause it's not in english.It's still my favorite bruce lee movie though."
5,bruce lee best movie,This was lee jun fan (aka bruce lee) 3rd movie many remember it for the final fight with chuck norris the story is simple but good on blu ray brings it to life by 10 fold and it's been 40 years since it was release for any bruce lee fan this movie is a must have
2,"American DVD release only, not the movie.","Retrun of the Dragon was the American re-cut and badly dubbed version of Bruce Lee's classic Way of the Dragon. Believe it or not this movie was Lee's highest grossing film in Hong Kong. He made this movie especially for that market. That's why it's so different than the others. But the DVD is bad. Go out and get the import disc title Way of the Dragon. The movie is a lot longer, it's uncut and in cantonese with english sub-titles and the movie is correctally matted at 2.50.1. You'll see it like you never have before!"
3,Bruce Calls the Shots,"After the success of ""Fist of Fury,"" Bruce Lee believed he could make better films than the Hong Kong directors. As a result, he called the shots on ""Way of the Dragon"" (1972). In his third starring feature, director-writer Lee emphasizes humor and characterization. Bruce plays a resourceful martial artist named Tang Lung who arrives in Rome to protect his relatives from mobsters. The highpoint is a climactic battle between Bruce and Chuck Norris in the Roman Colosseum - perhaps Lee's most brutal fight sequence. Though enjoyable, the remaining action scenes lack the bravura of ""Enter the Dragon"" and ""Fist of Fury."" Nevertheless, ""Way of the Dragon"" showcases Lee as an accomplished filmmaker whose skills might have flourished in more imaginative directions."
4,BRUCE LEE VS. CHUCK NORRIS ENOUGH SAID..,"Of all of Bruce Lee's movies this one is perhaps the most realistic and enjoyable in terms of martial arts action even more so than Enter the Dragon. The plot of a country bumbkin sent away from his home that ends up singlehandedly humiliating and dispatching pestering gangsters is again implemented, but is this time seen entirely through Bruce's eyes as Bruce wrote this screenplay. Comedy punchlines that fall flat, plot somersaults that defy logic and reasoning leaving the audience discombobulated however are forgetable, but the choreography of the fights are the apex of on screen martial-arts action. The gladiator duel set in the Colloseum with Bruce and Chuck Norris is the most climactic scene, and I found myself rewinding the scene over and over to catch Bruce Lee's footwork that seemed comparable to Muhammed Ali's. The scene where Bruce Lee wields two nunchaka at once is asskickingly breathtaking. Don't rent this movie. Buy it."
3,This DVD is availble as part of a larger set for a better price...,This DVD is available as part of the Ultimate Dragon Collection (Grindhouse Experience.) That is a 10 film set that packages this DVD (same cover and all) in a cardboard box with 2 other DVDs.Currently that set is selling for $19.98 on Amazon. So for $2 you get two extra discs of Bruce Lee knock offs.
2,Bruce Lee vs. Chuck Norris,"Two-thirds of Return of the Dragon are slow and boring as far as I'm concerned, but the reason I give this movie a second star is because of the final showdown between Bruce Lee and Chuck Norris. Unfortunately, that last fight scene was not as long as I hoped it would be."
3,"Good Movie, Could Be Better","It's hard to imagine that his film has been out for almost 30 years ago. It's about Lee, who came from Hong Kong to help his uncle's friends who run a restaurant in Rome, Italy, from thugs. The movie ""Rumble In The Bronx"" with Jackie Chan stole the idea from this film and made a few changes so it could be non-infringement. This film was half comedy and half martial art, though, still enjoyable. You can see the fightings are kinda slow and the blows barely touched. If you're into more martial art actions I would recommend ""Enter The Dragon""."
5,The Master's Masterpiece!!!,"ENTER THE DRAGON was very fun to watch, and was cool because it was the only one of Bruce's movies where you could hear his voice. BUT, RETURN (which was originally called WAY OF THE DRAGON, but renamed for the U.S. release) was Bruce's only turn as director and features him battling Chuck Norris in The Roman Coliseum. ABSOLUTELY BRUCE LEE'S BEST (certainly one of his funniest.) Just sit back and watch the master in action."
3,a very very poor release of a classic lee film,this dvd is poor no extras no multi language option and its not even the complete version.the region 2 disc has both orignal language with subtitles and dubbed versions.also its in widescreen on region 2 the way it should be its about time they gave u.s fans the version they want.check out the region 2 disc if you can with lots of nice extras and a superb audio commentry with co star jonn benn.
5,Great,This book presents the Navajo code talkers in a way that kids will remember. Beautiful illustrations -- beautiful text. Excellent book.
5,The lowest bass I have ever heard,"Their are alot of bass CDs out there for you to spend your hard earned cash on and it can be pretty confusing to know which ones will really shake the ground and win you that competition. I have to say that this CD definitely will as it is some of the lowest frequency bass ever recorded. I can recall cruising around in high school with friends and literally watching the windows on the cars around us vibrate as we bumped this joint. With track names like ""Richter scales"" and ""Thirty Below"" you really cant go wrong with Bass Quake."
5,great dvd,I bought this for my 14 month old granddaughter. She loves it and we have watched it over and over. I love the variety of programs.
5,2 years later...,My granddaughter still watches it every night she stays here to go to sleep. it has a variety that keeps her interest. all her favorites in one.
5,Great for the wind down,"I love the sleepy-time cartoons, works as a great incentive for my little ones to great ready for bed, makes wind down time really nice."
2,Good software -- Poor Text,"I bought this book for an MBA marketing class. This brief text appears to take selected information and marketing-engineering models from a larger, more complete textbook. The models are functional and useful. However, the text explanations leave a great deal to be desired. There are formulas without explanation, terms without explanation, etc. I think the authors ""abstracted"" the chapters from the larger text, rather than selecting specific ones and copying them completely.Still and all, the software is useful and instructive. I will be buying the complete book and software because I have been assured that the textbook's explanations are more complete. Were I to know then what I know now, I would just buy the complete textbook rather than this sampler."
5,McLeod's Daughters: the complete 6th season,"I watched these girls on TV and they went off the air. Now I follow then on dvd.... I can't wait for the next season to be released. The McLeod's are a true to live family...Loves, drama and family life.."
4,works well,these bags fit my vacuum perfectly and work well. my vacuum is old and it is hard to find bags for it. these are great.
2,"Pretty, but...","Chips if you look at it wrong! These are not porcelain, they are stoneware, and that is normal behavior for stoneware. Buyer beware."
4,"Loved ""A Mighty Heart:""","I liked ""A Mighty Heart"". Angelina Jolie was incredible in the film. The only thing that I didn't like was much of it was in another language so I couldn't understand what they were saying when they were interrogating suspects. I did not like ""Babel"". The whole movie was stressful with no high points."
3,Serote Salutes the Struggle,"Wally Serote salutes those who participated in 'the Struggle', presenting us with a bewildering array of characters that randomly appear. Many simply dissapear inexplicably, giving us a true sense of the mood of those struggle days.A worthy successor to the Acclaimed 'To Every Birth Its Blood'. Gods of our Time offers a compelling view of a turbulent time in South Africa's recent history."
1,AWFUL. SIMPLY AWFUL.,"I was sure that Dr.Otto was the worst Varney movie ever until I ran into this one. But then I only saw the first ten minutes. It looks like it was made by people wearing blindfolds and drinking warm Red Bull, and paying their seven year old brothers a hundred a week to make up sick teen sex jokes.This is a good movie to make your kids watch, so they have some idea of what hell might be like."
1,snowboard academy,This would have to be one of the worst movies corey haim has played in. The boarding was all fake and were just stupid scenes. The comedy in this movie was pretty stupid and un comical to tell you the truth.
3,Better then some,"These are the 3rd pair of headphone that I have owned. All things being equal, they are the best sounding pair that I have. But they do have some problems. Their range is very short. Going beyond the room where the base is can be troublesome. I have 800 Mhz headphones, and while know that frequency can penetrate walls better then 2.4Ghz I was hoping they would at least keep up with my laptop's wireless which they don't even come close. If your not going far from the base then these are the headphones for you!"
5,BEST CONDITIONER I CAME ACROSS SO FAR,"If you are using modern conditioners and shampoos with chemicals and worried about falling/dry hair, then this is a best solution for you. I bought this product 2 weeks ago. This conditioner does not use any artificial chemicals. It has got a very attractive smell. Its completely natural and it conditions your hair equivalent to other modern hair products. It takes 2 or 3 washes to get you equivalent to modern chemical based conditioners but its worth it. I will recommend this product if you wish to say goodbye to all the hair products with chemicals that damage your hair everyday. My hair falling reduced immidiately after switching to this conditioner and a similar shampoo without chemicals. Now I am satisfied that I am not damaging my own hair anymore."
2,Broke quickly,"I really like the way this little compass looks; it's easy to read and seemed as though it would be very handy. I'm a kayak fisher and clipped it onto the front of my PFD for quick reference. Unfortunately on the first trip out the plastic holding the compass to the pin broke and the compass fell off and rolled around the yak. It still works fine, but no longer has a pin attached. I can keep it in the pocket of my PFD now for reference if needed - but if I wanted something more durable, clearly, I'd have to spend a lot more money."
2,A couple bucks I could have used elsewhere,"Thought I could use it in my car, but the one I got points to or away from all kinds of unseen objects. Even in the house it's drawn more to the clock radio than Polar North. Not particularly useful for me."
1,Looks great but very disappointed with shredder & Customer Service,"I got mine as a present about 18 mths ago, when it would only shred 1 or 2 pages before it required a cool down. The warranty only lasted a year, and the customer service at Aurora didn't seem to have any knowledge of the product. I rarely used it up to that point, am extremely disappointed with both the shredder and Aurora Customer Service."
1,Not interesting,"I was excited to purchase this book as I was a big fan of Tucker's during his CNN crossfire days. After reading the book I really regret having purchased it. Most of the remarks in it are negative and not particularly interesting. There was a lot about his personal animosity towards various individuals, but very little about politics or any other kind of useful insight. There was also a complete lack of self analysis and not a lot of humor. Oh well. I would not reccomend this book."
3,Good Book,"As a Democrat who watches Crossfire from work daily, I have grown to like Tucker for his spontaneous wit and analysis ... even if I disagree. There was a lot of clever insight and stories. I'd be inclined to give it more stars, but it was somewhat short."
1,What a tool,"Carlson is a waste of space, and his writing is a waste of trees. If you delight in ignorance and misinformation, he's your man."
2,Politicians Partisans and Parasites,"I am a conservative and I just didnt like this book very much. The best part was the dirt on James Carvile, that was funny. Over all this was just a boring book."
1,Mindless Palaver,"I wanted to like Tucker Carlson's book. He has the opportunity to show the interesting side of politics. The truth is, the writing is horrible. I wouldn't waste the money on this book new. I'm sure there will be plenty of used available soon."
1,Show-biz and nothing else,"It is amazing that Carlson, who makes a living of spouting untruths and playing the show-biz game like Limbaugh, would criticize others for behaviors that make him popular himself. If you want pure fiction, there are better alternatives. If you want ""fake"" news, tune into the Daily Show."
3,Funny,"Head Of State is a funny movie, but not great. Thank God DC doesnt work like this. The film does have a message though."
3,A Good Laugh,My sentiment is the same as the amazon customer from Lansing. But Chris Rock didn't sale me on the movie. Bernie Mac did. So I would say if like Bernie Mac then you will like this movie. Also I liked the the deleted scenes from the DVD widescreen version. Robin Givens was a annoying distraction. Also I like Lynn Whitfield.
4,funny,For a movie starring two comedic geniuses Bernie Mac And Chris Rock this dissapoints. It's not that funny. There are some really funny scenes but it doesn't add up at the end. It is a good movie though and i liked it.
2,Lame!,"The movie was a disappointment for me. The comedy about unknown black guy (Chris Rock) becoming a president could be very funny but unfortumately, it wasn't funny at all. The jokes are all based on 'black guys/white guys' cliches that have been already played many times. Chris Rock is a great stand-up comedian but I yet to see a movie with him that was worth watching. Not recommended, unless you are a die hard Chris Rock' fan."
1,THIS MOVIE WAS HORRIBLE,"I saw this movie when it came out in the movie theaters, and i did not like it at all. I am a huge Chris Rock fan, I think he is hilarious and I usually like his movies. I think Chris Rock might have ruined his reputation with this movie. This movie was so boring. And, when you go to see a Chris Rock movie you expect to laugh every minute, this movie did not have that many funny parts. The parts that were funny were not even that funny. DO NOT BUY THIS DVD."
3,This movie was just o.k....,This movie had some pretty dumb comedy in it but that was to be expected. I'm not one for dumb humor but I usually don't mind Chris Rock so I decided to watch it. It really wasn't that bad. The ex-girlfriend showing up over & over was pretty dumb & the slapping & punching done throughout the movie was way too much. It was just pointless. If you like dumb comedy you may enjoy this movie as a rental but if you don't typically go for the dumb humor I'd say pass.
3,well.... it was ok...,"this was a good movie. i liked it. however, i think it wasn't one of chris rock's best performances. it seems like he was holding back his humor and ""funniness"". i definatly think that he could've made it fit his ""funniness"" better. its defianatly a good movie, but, as i said, he's done better. i would recomend this, but if you wabnt the real funny chris rock, then i suggest ""down to earth"" its got its emoitional side 2 it, but its HILARIOUS!!!!!!!! dat movie had me rollin fa dayz!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Not Vintage Chris Rock,"The previews and trailers were the thing that tempted me, but I found that the story and the humor just didn't tickle me as much as some of his other films have as I truly do LOVE Chris Rock's humor. IF you are bored silly and have nothing better to do, watch it, there are some scenes that work really well. His girlfriend/fiance with her screeching and as little exposure as she actually had in the movie just didn't work! In fact, if those scenes were cut out, I might have rated the movie higher."
3,MISSES THE MARK..,"I am a big fan of Chris Rock. Love almost all of his stand-up. But what may have worked quite alright as a skit on The Chris Rock Show just doesn't cut it as ""humor"" in a fullfledged movie.Too many disparate characters are smooshed in, while some characters such as the superwhore, the meatman etc are left so underdeveloped it makes you wonder why they were put in in the first place.Bromidic jibes about ""brothers"" doing drugs etc while white men being geeks are so 80s they'd make Beegees look postmodern. But Chris chose to stick with that kind of humor.Watching him and Bernie Mac slug each other in greeting was funny the first time. Having them get in a brawl later in the film as they have an intense discussion was disturbing. Mays Gilliam even advocates violence as a solution to dealing with certain controversial issues.What can one say. It really is a ""light"" movie, in every sense of the word. Worth a rental, maybe, nothing more."
3,Funny and enjoyable!,"I enjoyed this comedy. Was done to a good standard, and is filled with humor, which starts right from the beginning credits. The film doesn't have to stoop to low levels to get you to laugh, a quality in comedies that I always look for. The satire in the film is great, and the political humor is first rate! Chris rock does some good work in this movie. You'll enjoy this one."
4,Actually really good,"I reviewed a bunch of movies for a paper about how Hollywood portrays black presidents in movies (my conclusion is only a black person can be president if there is an impending disaster, a science fiction based story, a funny person or takes place in the far future).This was one of the 7 I watched (my favorite is The Man with James Earl Jones). I thought it was going to be a ridiculous joke but it was actually really good. Chris Rock is funny and smart in this."
5,Eerily similar to Obama,"Very eerily similar to Obama situation.I mean avoiding negative campaign. The hate, the black man thing, i mean its amazing...""If i quit, the whole black race can't run for 50 years."""
1,Head of Junk,"Ugh! The entire movie, all I could think about was, ""when is this going to get funny?"" I was SO disappointed in this. I figured a film directed and co-written by Chris Rock would be hilarious, and Bernie Mac would be the icing on the cake. Bernie Mac had all of about 15 minutes of screen time in this unfunny comedy. There were about 5 funny parts in the entire movie, which obviously makes for a complete waste of time. Chris Rock didn't even have a very funny character. It needed more Bernie Mac. For a better Chris Rock role, see ANYTHING else with him. For more Bernie Mac, watch his show or Ocean's Eleven. This was a stupid movie ... It is not a ridiculous PG-13 rating. The rating mostly reflected some profanity and brief muted sexual innuendo. This was a waste of time and a waste of money."
3,Would have voted for the other guy.,"I don't really care who's white and who's black at all, but some of the things that Chirs Rock's charecter stood for were so liberal that I would have voted for thje other guy. I'm a Repulican and think the idea of gun contol is dumb, and Chirs Rock suggested that if someone had a gun, beat him up. Overall, it was okay, but had alot of ""Lets make fun of white people jokes because they won't care anyway"" jokes. It's like...it just mmakes me mad that this movie had alot of racist jokes toward whites, but oh well."
1,So unfunny,"Chris Rock, who is a noted racist, couldn't possibly less funny than he was in this film. This movie is utterly horrible and I have no idea how it ever got made. The jokes are bad and the racism exhibited by Rock in this film is disturbing."
2,Head of State,"This movie is in a so-so state. Too serious to be funny - too funny to be serious. Now don't get me wrong, there are some laughs, but those are tempered with a government whose election isn't the democratic way. Maybe the lack of zip makes this undemocratic election too close to home and drags the film down. Maybe Rock took on too much with starring, writing and directing. The whole thing's a maybe."
5,Better than I expected it to be,"I really wanted to see this movie when it came out in theaters till I saw the scene with the old ladys dancing. Thats when I realized it was a joke, so I just decided not to see it, but I went to go rent so I just made my decision to rent it. It is very funny. Chris Rock and Bernie Mac are very funny in this film. I just suprised me to see this too on screen becuase I would always know they would make a great on-screen team. The story goes as Chris Rocks character ""Mays"" is running for president and wants his big brother Bernie Mac's character ""Mitch"" to be his vice president. It has great story and great visiuals and it is a must see film."
3,Completely Hilarious!!!,"First off, I would not recommend this movie if you are looking for a comedy with a strong plot or storyline. What you see in the commercials and trailors is basically it. If you are looking for comedy, then yes... this movie is hilarious. Anyone who knows Chris Rock knows his humor and it shows in this movie. Just the fact that him and Bernie Mack are together is enough to make even the most serious laugh. If your trying to find a funny movie to see with a date or just with friends on a night out, this is the movie for you. You will be laughing without control at times. The theatre I was in was cracking up! I give this movie 4.0 stars laughter wise... but overall I give it 3.5 stars. The acting can be somewhat bad at times and the plot could be stronger, but you will probably be too busy laughing to notice that."
3,Funny but lacking entertainment!,"I admit I laughed during this movie but what made me give it 3 stars was the plot. Okay, it would be cool for a black guy to run for president, but with the way people are today, there won't be a black president, but if this is what he/she would be like, I'm all for it!Chris Rock's directorial debut could have been better much better but instead it had a few good laughs but it just wasn't enough to make me want to buy it.OVERALL GRADE: 7.9/10"
5,Pretty funny movie,"Chris Rock can be hilarious at times. I saw this movie a lot and it seems less funny each time, but there are still parts I can't help laughing at. It is a very funny movie and I recommend it."
2,"Some Laughs, but Mostly Embarassing!!","Down on his luck, a Washington D.C. alderman accepts a chance to run for President of the United States. Chris Rock's fantasy comedy certanly had me laughing at times. Bernie Mac, Tracy Morgan and Robin Givens were hilarious in their roles. But overall, the stereotypical urban humor was rather embarassing to watch. It could have been a much more funnier film if they stayed away from it."
5,invaluable source of thought for anarchist teachers,"As a teacher with strong philosophical opinions that are essentially anti- teacher and anti- school, its important to find a text which sheds more light on where you see yourself inside an educational institution as a practitioner. This book does that job. Brilliant."
4,Great reference for the Tenchi fan!,"Guardians of Order delivers its usual thorough job on Tenchi in Tokyo, the next installment of its Role Playing Guide based on the 3rd Tenchi series. This book includes complete summaries for all 26 episodes, with lots of pictures (unfortunately in black & white). Character listings expand on and contrast vs. previous writeups in GOO's most excellent Tenchi Muyo RPG and Resource Book. You do not have to be a Role Playing Gamer to appreciate this book."
2,"Should be Titled ""Henry II""","This bio is more about Henry the Second, than Eleanor. Now granted, there is a significant period of time where Eleanor is locked up in her lonely castle, and according to other biographers, no letters or correspondance remain from that time. But there is so little of Eleanor in this bio, I felt jipped. For a FANTASTIC bio of Eleanor, try Alison Weir!"
3,pretty good,"I'm a big fan of Shaun T's Rockin Body videos. I got this for my daughter and her girls, age 2.5 and 4.5. My daughter, who doesn't exercise much, liked it, but the girls only lasted about a minute before getting distracted."
3,fun,"This is a very fun workout for kids and Shaun T is very motivating. The only thing that I did not like is that he says ""OMG"" at one point. I felt it an unnecessary exclamation and we don't allow our kids to say that."
5,Ever more fascinating,"With each Aimee Leduc novel, Cara Black gets better--ever more deft and graceful at storytelling and characterization, while still giving us the intensity of Paris. At the very start of this book, Aimee is attacked and blinded. The police suggest she was the victim of a serial killer. But was she? Aimee struggles to navigate in the world of the blind while considering several unfolding crimes. Among the wonderful things about this book is the emergence of her partner Rene from prop sidekick status--it is Rene who acts to uncover crucial evidence, and Black's portrait of him is powerful and poignant. The action takes place in a Paris that is not a tourist fantasy but a tough metropolis. As ever, no other writer today gives us Paris like this. Black remains that rarity--a marvelous storyteller who believes readers have a brain."
2,drivel,"Being stuck for a week with only the first seven Leduc Investigations books to read (three I had to give up on), I now know literary hell. The main character is a leftist private detective, who dislikes the incompetent and corrupt police (but is the daughter of a senior Prefecture of Police officer), who has a weakness for bad boys, Couture fashion and cigarettes, and is possibly the most annoying character I have read. The author has no clue about criminal investigations, French law enforcement, weapons, or forensics, but besides that...Also the author besides her socialist leaning drivel and improbable plot lines, has the charming ability of making Paris the City of Light, seem as drab, grimy and nearly appealing as Detroit."
2,booooooring,lots of misdirection and confusion with no conclusion.stock characters left undeveloped.paris-o-philes might like the scenery.
1,poor,"this is a sub par wig... besides ill fitting, it has a petroleum smell. It gave me a rash when I tried it on."
5,A Handbook for Development,"This book is the answer to The Ugly American. Thomson gives to readers what may be the most believable account of the difficulties in working with poor, malnourished groups of people. He validates his claims with personal experience, and keeps his writing informal as to make relating to these experiences easy. There will be a line of friends waiting to read this when you are finished."
2,A little too jaded for my taste,"As a young, idealistic future Peace Corps volunteer to Ecuador, I found this book a little too dark. While I am not completely naive to volunteerism, study, and work in developing countries (and the accompanying hardships), I felt that Thomsen never gave the reader hope. Did he have hope? Maybe his motivation for this book was not to focus on all the glamour and goodness that many other books do. However, we can see through different eyes without being clouded by negativity. That is the path I hope to take as I embark on my 2+ year experience. I guess this book did not provide the inspiration I was looking for. I'm sure I'll feel differently after I return. I do appreciate his brutal honesty though."
3,INSIGHTFUL,"For anyone interested in the early Peace Corps experience in a Spanish-speaking nation, this book is insightful. Thomsen wrote in clear, unadorned, and unvarnished prose which was unusual during those early years when the market was saturated with propaganda. Thomsen towed no party line but rather described his experience in great detail, some may agree too much detail. Although a great book for aspiring volunteers which may aid them to temper their missionary tendencies with a dose of reality, the book is over-written. It could easily have been whittled down some 100 pages.Thomsen became a legend among the Peace Corps community. During his life, he befriended many. Very late in his life, he penned The Saddest Pleasure, a travel book which was his opus."
5,excellent,"Excellent for the price. Praise God!""The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our God shall stand for ever."" (Isaiah 40:8)"
3,"Good, compact bible, but writing is very small","Great small bible for reference if you are looking for a smaller thick-ish bible. Too hard for me to actually sit down and read, however, due to the small print."
4,King James Big print Bible,"Bible is great just a light blue cover no problem,enjoy reading with good size letters"
5,Definately great for learning on your own,"This book is GREAT for self study. I orignally had bought it for a class at college. I found myself reading the book in class instead of listening to the lecture and with some practice at home I was able to learn the first four weeks of the class in only a few days. This book is a very good book for beginners. The author is very good about explaining the concepts of HTML by using one main example for each new skill being taught. He could have went a little more in depth with frames, but I have yet to find a book that explains how to make frames very easily. The author also touches a bit of javascript which was nice. Definately worth the money."
5,Excellent for a self-study course!,I thought that this book was very comprehensive and easy to follow. I loved the way they set up a specific case for each tutorial so that you were creating web pages as you learned the new material.
4,Foundational to modern Christological Discussion,"This is an astoundingly well-researched book. Dunn's work on the titles ascribed to and/or accepted by Jesus started a fruitful debate on the subject -- a debate to which he continued to contribute. Since the discussion has progressed beyond this book, it is somewhat dated; but it is foundational and still of primary value. To understand recent scholarship in Christology, one needs to be familiar with this book.For the novice, I might recommend beginning with Part Four of Dunn's ""Jesus Remembered"" and, if your appetite is stimulated, following with this more in-depth (although earlier) treatment."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!!,"Horrible seller. Ended up paying triple the price for this item. 3 dollars per bag!!! After I received the item, which I thought was coming with the Mighty Mite I just purchased, I looked at the invoice and saw that I'd payed 9 dollars for 3 bags! I called company to try to return it and the said they would not refund my purchase. I feel tricked and cheated!"
5,Ja - I like it! Give us more musik Florian!,The masters are finally back to work. Give us more music Ralf and fewer urlaubs. Lately I have been listening to more industrial screaming synths like Allen Ravenstine with early Pere Ubu. The machines and factories make me happy.When I do not feel so industrial - I listen to the masters - Kraftwerke.Hallo Ralf & Florian.
5,I feel like I have waited a lifetime!,"I can't explain how thrilled I am to have the Mod Squad back on TV, and right in my home. I was a pre-teen when this show premired and it became an instant favorite. My thrill back then was looking each week at Michael Cole. His face not only adorned my black and white TV set, but the back of my bedroom door. All those great pictures from 16 and Tiger Beat proudly were displayed on that door for many years (much to my mother's distain may I add) My thrill now is seeing the episodes in color! I know that sounds silly, but we didn't have a color TV until 1976 so I can't wait to see my long lost love...Michael Cole in living color!I'm sure I will be transported back to being 12 years old!Thanks Paramount for being so smart as to bring back these great nostalgic shows!"
5,Mod Squad - still Great,"Loved this tv show as a teenager, and even though I am a bit older now, lol, I still enjoyed watching this DVD. It is good to see the characters again just as I remembered. This DVD continues where Season 1, Volume 1 left off."
4,"Love the message, love the messenger, dvd itself is terrible!",I wanted to give this dvd 5 stars just for the fact William Oribello is excellent! But what happened to the rest of the lecture? He states there will be a break and will come back to discuss psychic self defense. I even flipped the disc over thinking it may continue on the other side? It is definitely an incomplete program! We should all get half our money back!
3,First and Best of the Blood Island Movies,"A shipwrecked sailor washes ashore on Blood Island and is nursed back to health by the local mad doctor (Francis Lederer) and his neglected blonde bombshell of a wife. Our mad doctor has spent two years surgically transforming a black panther into the semblance of a man, complete with some sort of drug regimen to enlarge the creature's brain. Smart as it now is, the beastie keeps escaping and killing the locals, who get fed up and evacuate the island, leaving the foreigners to their fate. This is pretty much a by-the-numbers imitation of the Universal horror films, with obvious inspiration from Wells' Island of Dr. Moreau. It's Lederer's performance as an unnervingly calm, ultra-rational scientist that keeps the movie from becoming a cliche - the insanity is in his work, not in his demeanor. which just seems to make it more chilling."
1,Not the real deal,"This is NOT a Genuine Eureka Hepa Filter as depicted in the advertisement. Under the guise of having a Green Policy, they state that they have the manufacturer ship items without the retail wrap and packaging materials, so they shipped this filter in a mailing envelope, which would be fine, except for the fact that it does not say Eureka on it and it is slightly larger than the GENUINE Eureka product and has a black screen on the back instead of the white overlay that Eureka uses. I have no confidence that this will work properly so will not use it. Amazon needs to police their vendors better!"
1,Not a real Eureka filter!,"I bought this item in May of 2010 and it came in a box as pictured here and it looked exactly like the filter that came with my vacuum. I re-ordered in April 2011 and I received some generic part with a black screen on the back without a box...just thrown into the amazon box. I returned it and ordered from another seller on Amazon, and received the same damn filter. Why are these people advertising genuine filters and sending out cheap replacements?"
2,Hepa or Helpa,"This filter is hard to attach to back of sanitaire vacumn. Even with the {2 line instructions}, it was hard. I was afraid I would snap off the tabs, or the clips.I eventually did it , but it doesn't snap in place easily."
4,filter,vacume filter to help keep down the hai and dust for us with alergies and keep our house clean and happy
5,Filters great for my Eureka SC3683A,"I bought this for my Eureka SC3683A model vaccum. It seemed like it wouldn't fit at first, but then I got it on and it snapped into place.I have sensitive sinuses and vaccuming with the cheap bagless vaccums always used to congest my nose. With this filter attached I don't get anything like that. Not sure if it's an authentic Eureka part, but it seems to work perfectly. And it was very inexpensive. I think anyone getting a Eureka SC3683A should get this. At this price, there is no reason not to."
1,not as specified,"I got a charcoal Eureka-type filter, not made by eureka. I returned it. I did not want a charcoal filter because I was concerned that it would cause leakage of allergens from the vacuum which some hepa filters do because they hinder the efficiency of the vacuum."
2,could somebody resolve the 200/400 confusion please?,On Amazon:The product title says SAMe (400mg)The description says SAM-E 2X 200mgOn the product:Front: SAMe 200mgBack: SAMe (S-Adenosyl L-Methionine)(from 400 mg of S-Adenosyl-L-Methionine Disulfate Tosylate)What a mess! Should I return it?
1,The title is misleading,"It's not 400 mg. It's 200 mg, 1 bottle. Both the main title and the 2X are misleading. There are cheaper version of 200 mg tablets listed."
5,candy,I JUST LOVE ODERING STUFF FROM AMAZON AND EVERY THING I GET I HAVEN'T HAD ANY PROBLEM WITH IT TY SO MUCH
2,Did not taste good,"I have been looking for gum drops for a long time and was excited about getting these. I was disappointed. They do not have the flavors of the gum drops I remember as a kid. They all had a strange flavor, even the green and orange, which you would think would be pretty universal. They are way too expensive (shipping is half the cost of the product) to order for the quality and the taste was not very good."
1,Bad work,"It is quite a shame, that this facsimile is so badly made. The pictures are really bad reproduced and why is it, that page 117 is not there. Instead page 113 is shown one more time. And in several places the text is distorted from the scanning."
1,This is history,"This is simply old, old public domain stuff.The writing style is so outdated as to be onerous.I can't see why such garbage even exists here.If I had 3 thumbs, they'd all be pointing DOWN!"
2,shameless or blind,"Glorifying and corny. Unconditional praise of Edison achievements. Though the authors are clearly well-read, too many facts are ignored in the account of the circumnstances that lead Edison to the accumulation of patents. Lacks any critic view and end up creating an image of an ""american hero"" that is as ridiculous as untruth. I quote, just as an example, ""In fact, if it were not for Edison's peculiar mentality, that refuses to recognize anything as impossible until indubitably demonstrated to be so, the production of motion pictures would certainly have been delayed for years, if not for all time.""Anyone seriously interested on the subject of the birht of cinema would recognize this as total nonsense or shameless manipulation of facts.A book to avoid by anyone interested in having a truthfull and independent view on history."
3,Good overview,"I thought this was a good overview of his life, but being from Port Huron there are some mistakes in the book. The most glaring mistake is that he was thrown off the train at Mount Clemens. It didn't happen there. He was thrown off the train at SMITH'S CREEK!"
2,Text Only,"This book is fine for what it is, but it consists merely of a reprint of the original text. None of the original figures or illustrations are included, and these are an integral part of the book."
5,It was fun to read,Edison's life and inventions tell a truly amazing story. Edison's achievements are explained wonderfully in this book which I found fun to read.
3,Interesting,"Although I had hoped to get a little more out of this book, it still was interesting enough to keep my attention. This book is only text. There are no illustrations to go along with the book, so if you are more of a visual person, I would say avoid this book unless you are interested in this topic."
4,Good but a little tricky,"I got this toy for my classroom (I teach Pre-K), and my kids really enjoy using it with me. They love that it ""shoots out"" chips from the frogs mouth. The only downside is that the chips tend to stick in the mouth and cause a back-up. I'm still glad I got it though."
5,Escaping to dream land!,"What a wonderful escape! I enjoyed the dreamlike stories, even though some are a little dark. This is one book I will keep!"
2,Save your money.,"I happen to like many of the fine wood sets offered by House of Staunton (HOS). HOS has a good reputation and has always treated me fairly, so I have no axe to grind. But I completely agree with C. Amara's review of this set. These HOS plastics look and feel cheap and clunky, and are impractical, particularly for speed chess. So, I too, am still using my generic weighted ""Club"" set.The club sets are the de facto standard for good reason. They are attractive and the ""triple weighted"" club models have good balance and heft. They're durable, and affordable, typically priced at 1/4th (or less) the price of these HOS plastics. The club sets can be found in a variety of color shades (e.g. ivory, antique white, yellow, etc.), finish (glossy or matte), and durability (ranges from brittle to kid-proof) so it pays to shop around. Generally, the better quality club sets cost a bit more, but even the worst of the weighted club sets are a better deal than this HOS set."
5,Great Chess Set,"The first reviewer really said it all. This is a very nice, rugged, heavy plastic Chess set. Perhaps its weight is a double edged feature. But I like the heft of the chessmen. The first reviewer is wrong about the square size of the included roll-up vinyl board... it is 2.25 inches per square. Just right for this set. This set is well worth the money -- the wood version of the same pieces cost hundreds of dollars."
3,Keyless FOB,Ok so far. But battteries seem to need replacement too frequently. The quotes from Jeep dealerships to program it ranged from $10. to $ 60.?
4,Liked It,I'm on a Baba Ishmael kick. He does an excellent job of making fun of America's pretentions and racist climate.
4,the best of all frankensteins,"From my point of view, this is the best version of Shelley`s tale; I have seen Branagh`s, Whale's(and others) but they are all very far from the spirit of the novel... Per Oscarsson and Leon Vitali are fine on their roles... If you like the true Frankenstein, this is your movie....Beautiful landscapes; a very peacefully film... A must see."
3,Works OK,Didn't seem to work any better than vasoline on my new glove. Only cost $6.99 in the local sporting goods store.
3,Works ok,"Used the product as directed. It softens the leather, but not like a glove you had for years. Since you only work the pocket on the last application, you will have to continue to break in the pocket."
4,works buy has a hidden flaw,"This product works well and does what it states; however be careful and follow the directions closely. I would even not do the repetitions step. Out of ten players that used this 8 has to replace the laces within a year. After talking with all of the 8 of them thay all set the oven to 350, and did the second application the same day. Just be easy, and only use once then keep the glove clean and lube it every so often. 4 stars due to the fact that overheating the glove laces is a problem."
5,Mans knife,Very good knife. Good feel and balance. Gut hook is a good added feature.I would surely recommend this knife for any hunter
4,Quality product,"I have used Case knives for many years and have never been dissatisfied with the quality of their products. The knives are made in America, which is not the case with many knives on the market today. They hold an edge, are relatively easy to sharpen and give many years of service. This particular product was promptly received and was exactly as described."
3,"well written, interesting","I found this book in a discount bin in our campus bookstore. I am interested in memoirs, Africa life and racial issues, so I picked it up. This is the author's account of growing up in poverty and fear in South Africa. This book gives some insight into the racial and economic struggles of black families, but it is more of his own life experiences, which certainly give insight into the racial tensions and present a clear picture of poverty in South Africa, but were somewhat disappointing as I was hoping to find a historical and sociological study of racial tensions in South Africa. The language is beautiful, however, and Mphahlele is a very distiguished and talented writer. I was remined of Naguib Mahfouz's Midaq Alley in Mphahlele's funny descriptions and antecdotes about his neighbors. As far as the content, however, I was disappointed by the lack of insight I gained into South African society and politics."
1,The description is hard to follow,"This book looks structured at the first glance. But reading in detail, you will find that the book omits a lot of important detail for the algorithm. Also the language used in this book is hard to follow."
2,disappointing,"After putting the stand together I was initially quite satisfied with it. It's sufficiently heavy, which was a necessity, and it's compact. Then I used it. While it was fine while it was being used when I picked it up to put it away the top portion snapped off just above the nut. ""Heavy duty"" it isn't. Perhaps there should be a warning to only lift it by the base because the metal is so weak. I did pick it up by the upper portion but I would imagine that that would not be unusual or unanticipated by the manufacturer. I don't think it's too much to ask that the metal connector be strong enough to lift the base. Rather than returning it for a refund (that is the only option available) I will try to solder the parts back together. If it breaks again I'll look elsewhere for a replacement."
4,Solidly Built,"Others have reviewed this product well, so I won't rehash things here. But I will add to what has been stated.1) Yes, the plastic insert doesn't fit well. But with some light sanding, I think I can get it to fit. Or, I can just leave it out. This is why I only gave it four stars.2) It is sturdy. I don't know how the one reviewer could have broken it unless it was defective.3) I received the one with the round base as the original photo shows, not the rectangular one shown on the additional photos.The added heft of the base was worth spending extra money for. I definitely will feel more secure my iron isn't going anywhere. I hope this helps."
5,Works great and a cheap price!,"Works exactly as I intended. There isn't much to review on this one. The base is heavy and solid. The sponge just needs a little water and it perks right up. It's small enough to stay out of your way too. I didn't need any special magnification or arms to hold objects. If you don't either, this should work perfectly."
3,Good product,"We live on heavily wooded acres in clay country. At times we like to vent the house with fresh air. And when it's dry and dust and pollen is blowing, we can open a window without a lot of the bad stuff blowing it. However, air flow is minimal but better than none at all."
5,Fast-paced and Action-packed,"Season 4 is even more compelling than Season 3. While Season 3 episodes tended to be at a slower pace, Season 4 episodes are more like thrillers. Also, the high level of artistry that went into the production of this series is remarkable. You can tell they were inspired by Film Noir when they made this series. Don't miss the high energy of Mannix Season 4!"
5,Mannix is the best,I always enjoy Mannix ... every show is entertaining !!!!!!!!!!!! Can't wait for all the seasons. I have one through four now and will order the remaining seasons as soon as available.
5,MANNIX SEASON 4,"to bad hollywood has no talent these days behind or in front of the camera. mannix is a perfect example of when tv had class and talent. if you are into american idol and reality showstry going back to when tv was great for a change, you will be surprised. mannix (mike conners) plays a tough private eye and always has you on the edge of your seat. each episode is uniqueand interesting. this is a must have for those who like good scripts and good acting."
2,Immortality- At a Price,"This is yet another film I purchased because Jack Davenport is in the cast. His part is very small and his haircut is not so good. But he does exhibit some sexy, boyish charm. Jude Law is the star of the film about a vampire who preys on vulnerable women. He is creepy and maipulative and feeds on love. He believes if he can find a woman to love him ""perfectly"", he will stop. There are some very bloody scenes and one tracheotomy scene that is absurd. I suppose it is an interesting variation on the vampire theme."
4,THE WISDOM OF CROCODILES,"This movie shows up on late night cable once in a while. I caught it because I was intrigued that a Hong Kong director was used. Years ago, I only paid attention to Jude Law because someone said he resembled a young Anthony Hopkins channeling Hannibal Lector. Well, he's not playing the young Doctah Lectah in the movie so catch him in this nice movie to see why its a shame he didn't get to play the character (better this than ALFIE.) His character like Hugh Grant's character in About A Boy targets undervalued women. Strangely, this movie reminds me of Whit Stillman's Metropolitan which I just watched yesterday and is also about an undervalued woman."
4,HarlemluvsthaLaw,"This movie was depicted beautifully. The director provided a visual treat, the color contrast and movement of the film was excellent. I believe the title is slightly misleading. I wish this film was longer and exposed the character's background a little more.I definitely wanted to know more about the character Steven (Law). I enjoyed watching Steven deal with his inner conflict.I will definitely look into more films by this director and of course Law."
4,"human, mammal, reptile","Stylish and well paced, it's been awhile since a movie has had me riveted to my chair. Some have protested that this isn't really a vampire movie, and they're probably right. A large twist on the need for another's blood, it is still a thriller nonetheless. The acting is superb, with the story showcasing Mr. Law's ability to convincingly portray his character once again. Add to this, Ms. Lowensohn's excellent performance and you have 90 minutes of a taut and intelligent suspense thriller. My only complaint is the title, ""Immortality"" which isn't connectible to the movie in any way I can see. The original title, ""The Wisdom Of The Crocodile,"" makes a lot more sense when you've seen the movie."
3,Only Law Will Live Long in Your Head Beyond This Movie,"This is a movie that wants you to think about it afterwards, but the plot is so clumsy and Jude Law's ""love interest"" is so nondescript that you can't help but forget about it a few minutes later. What the movie does have going for it is splendid cinematagrophy and another knockout performance by Law, who stars as a vampire who must make women fall in love with him before drinking their blood. At lease I think that's the idea, though we're never really sure as the film seems like a three hour epic that's been haplessly cut in length, losing the meaning of the central romance. Of course I'm not sure this is the case, but if it is I'm not looking forward to seeing the director's cut, as the love story is the film's weakest link. Still worthwhile, if only for the police interrogation scenes, which I wish there had been more of."
4,Strange but engaging,"I got this movie by mistake but wasn't disappointed. It is defitely not 'vampire' movie but rather an attempt to some phylosophical sharade about love and life (at least, that's how I understood it). Jude Law is as usual very good but the same cannot be said about main female actress. It is slow sometimes but this comes with the style of this movie"
2,Sigh,"WHY, JUDE, WHY?! I thought this movie was completely boring. I felt the plot made little sense and the characters were lame. Wish I hadn't bought it."
2,Not Judes best decision,"I am a big fan of Jude Law and wanted to see this when it was first released under the title ""Wisdom of Crocodiles"", but i dont remember it ever being released in America. When i found out it was available in America on DVD, i rented it. I was thourouhgly unimpressed. The movie is very slow moving, and Jude Law, while usually a fantastic actor in even the drabbest setting, was unmistakably boring. Law plays a ""vampire"" who feeds off the emotions his victims carry in their blood. He keeps records of the victims with the particular emotion they had that was fulfilling for him. He wooed his victims for a time and each fell in love with him before meeting their death. Until the final victim, whose name escapes me because she was bad, makes him fall in love with her and she in turns becomes the death of him. this movie is not bad but it is far from great.. definitely wait for cable..."
1,a movie that's going nowhere,"Jude Law plays this mysterious vampire/serial killer who meets his match in (i. e. falls in love with) Elina Lowensohn. An overlong film. Lot's of navel gazing and moments of expresionless facial shots. In short, a film trying to suck in the 'art-house' crowd. I have reason to believe that the title has been changed to give the prospective victim (the buyer) a clue to the flimsy plot! We've seen edgy vampires done before and this ain't it!"
4,Good for schools teachers,This is part of of a full collection of video programs about ballet. Is a fun way to find out more about ballet history recommended for ballet teachersI can't believe is not yet in digital media DVD Blue Ray or downloadable versions.
5,A 5-star-er!!!,"An incredibly entertaining read.. this book was attached to my hand for a couple of days because i couldn't put it down. gary goshgarian is an extremely talented writer and should be put up there with the best.. i recommend this book to everyone and those that read it.. thank me.. if you like this book.. read ""elixir"" by gary braver (new pen name for gary goshgarian). his work is brilliant.. simply stated."
4,another Naxos good-for-the-price,"Another near-hit: the Handel Saul done by Martini and the Frankfurt Baroque Orchestra. The soloists are generally quite good, especially Macleod's Saul; and Barbara Schlick warbles prettily as usual. David Cordier's David is rather watery, and more than usual David and Johnathan sound like they're about to bop down together to shop for window treatments.The period-instruments orchestra is top-notch, and the recorded sound is vivid (and quite resonant) and lively (befitting a live recording). But the chorus -- the Junge Cantorei -- indeed sounds young and LARGE. They pack a punch in the loud bits but are quite blurry and sometimes not quite getting all the notes. And fatigue seems to set in in Act III for everyone involved (partly Handel's fault; after Saul is buried, attention flags).Certainly worth the price (for the instrumental playing and soloists, certainly), but not the only Saul you'll ever need."
5,"great albums, buy them from mute or directly from neubauten","anything before tabula rasa the band hasn't seen a dime, go to mute or the band's website so they get paid for their art."
5,Neubauten'ss most accessible,"i had some problems with their previous work (which has its moments) but this was a gigantic leap forward on all levels. Both musically sonically and lyrically. It is actually very listenable hard indutrial experimental rock. I think it s their best because while not as experimental as previous stuff, it manages to be challenging and listenable at the same time."
2,Expected more,"As others have noted, I thought there would be more excitement and more discovery. And the very end -- not to give it away, but I would have just expected more effort on behalf of her one true love."
4,Fantastic read!,"My husband and I actually raced home to see who could get to the book first. Why, why would we start reading the same book at nearly the same time? He loved it. I loved it. True this first book spends more time aquainting you with Maisie than it does unravelling a mystery but that was just fine with us. Very entertaining and we are both looking forward to tagging along on our dear Maisie's adventures. FYI - a man-friend enthusiastically suggested this series to me :)"
5,FASCINATING,VERY INTERESTING PREVIEW TO HER OTHER BOOKS I LOVE THE CHARCTER AND ALL OF THE SUPPORTING CAST TO THE STORIES THEN WITH THE INTRODUCTIONS OF THE REST OF THE GROUP ITS STIL A SURPRISE WITH THE TWIST AND TURNS OF HER STORIES LOVE THIS GENRE OF BOOKS AND THE TIME FRAME. FOUND IT VERY INFORMATIVE AND HISTORICALLY ACCURATE CANT WAIT FOR HER NEXT BOOK.I HAVE NOW READ THEM ALL BUT THE NEW ONE.
4,Charming and entertaining,"Thoroughly researched, delightfully written, and drawn from the author's family history, I found Maisie Dobbs to be a lovely read. The author presents a beautifully-rendered portrait of a very special time in modern history, seen through the eyes of a believable, brilliant-yet-very-human young woman. Ms. Winspear defines her characters clearly, yet with compassion. I'm happily awaiting the arrival of the next in the series in my mailbox!"
4,First of Series worth the read,"Winspear does an outstading job in three areas. First, the accuracy of her historical account. Second, her characterizations are excellent. She describes each of her characters, both main and secondary, with such force, you feel you know them personally. And saving the best for last, her writing skill is superb. The ebb and flow of her ability to paint a picture with words is unsurpassed. It was a joy to read Masie Dobbs as well as Birds of a Feather. The only downside to Winspears books are the length. She takes too long in some areas to accomplish her goal. But you get through it without much pain because the writing style is such a pleasure."
1,One-dimensional Maisie Dobbs,"Full disclosure: I didn't finish the book. I just couldn't. I have to have some connection with a complex hero, but Maisie was not that hero. I kept waiting for some character development, some inner conflict. No. Maisie is a two-bit psychoanalyst, and a very boring one at that. Before reading this book, I read Bonfire of the Vanities. it was a beautifully-wrought, complex masterpiece with fully realized characters. I couldn't fathom wasting my time on Maisie when there are so many amazing books out there to be read.Adieu, Maisie!"
3,Overrated,"after reading the effusions here on amazon, I was frankly expecting more. The writing and plot construction as well as the idealization of the protagonist betray amateur-level writing. Good theme. I'm sorry I couldn't like it more."
4,Welcome new series,"Maisie Dobbs by Jacqueline Winspear is a delightful, new book book. She paints a vivid picture of life for a young woman ""in service"", in England in the years preceding The Great War. As Maisie matures and is educated, she volunteers to go to France, to nurse the wounded allied soldiers. The scenes of the terrible scarring of bodies and souls change the direction of her life.The book manages to charm, all the while depicting life in extremely difficult circumstances."
3,Massie,I found it Well written with Interesting characters. This book is the first of a series purchased on my Kindle
5,Couldn't put it down.,A mystery that truly kept me in suspense.A relaxing read without foul language & gruesome details.Each character is so endearing that I will be following MaisieDobbs in her other adventures.
3,A promising series,I wish Amazon let me give half stars because I would give this book more like 3.5 stars. It was good but I was expecting more of a mystery and instead I got a novel with bits of mystery and sleuthing. But that's not to say I didn't like it....I did like the first book of the series but I am more excited to see how it progresses in future books. I get the feeling that the next books will be more mystery than the story of Maisie Dobbs. See my full review here: [...]
2,Disappointing,I really wanted to like this book. I love the Royal Spyness books and this was suggested to me by amazon. I thought the writing style was choppy and none of the characters were properly developed. At the end of the book I felt like I really didn't know much about the characters. And the story did not flow smoothly. I liked the idea of 'The Retreat' but it wasn't exactly thrilling. It was completely obvious something was going on. I will not be reading another Maisie Dobbs novel.
4,Very easy reading,"If you like mysteries and but want a light read, this is a very good book. I enjoyed it very much."
4,Cozy Historical Mystery,"In the opener to the Maisie Dobbs series, the audience is introduced to an intelligent young female detective. The novel begins with her accepting a case, but is interspersed with flashbacks of her past. We see Maisie as a young housemaid sneaking into the house's library to read philosophy and history, being introduced to the man who will be her mentor, and working as a nurse in World War 1. It's not your average mystery series, and Maisie isn't your average detective.Maisie Dobbs has mystery, a great historical setting (Britain and France in the early twentieth century), class differences, and romance. This would be a great mystery series for people who want to avoid graphic violence or sex, however, I would add that the mystery is secondary to the larger historical setting and character development."
3,A little dissapointed,"I found this book on the floor, in the corner of a room...and I'm almost tempted to put it back. It's not HORRIBLE, but it wasn't great either. I liked the story line overall, but I was bored by Maisie. I felt that the interruption of the introduction to her current life and mystery with her entire backstory was off-putting. It threw me off guard, and when the story came back to Maisie's present, I'd forgotten what was going on. I did enjoy her view of the war and her experiences, but overall I didn't care about Maisie. I did a lot of skimming and felt that the book didn't really pick up until the last couple chapters. It's definitely an easy, light read, and probably a good book to read between some of the more heavy reading."
3,decent read - sloppy read,"i liked the heroine and enjoyed all the historical details. i thought that the story moved a little slow in the beginning but picked up in the second half. i was very disappointed in the quality of the kindle edition. it seems the publisher doesn't bother with proofreading or correctly formatting the e-book version of many of the books. however, they don't seem to mind charging high prices for an inferior product. for this reason alone, i will probably not go further in the series."
2,Maisie Dobbs -- pathetic,"I also read good reviews of this novel and bought it on that basis. I have to agree with those reviewers who felt that it was incredibly over-rated. The title character could be a ""Mary Sue"", she's so badly written. Breaking a novel's narrative flow with a very long flashback is generally a mistake, but in this case was probably done in an attempt to conceal the thinness of the plot. It didn't work. I give it 2 stars because it was ""readable"", just not good."
3,Hokey,"Hokey, cliched, loaded with predictable plot twists (see Enid's fate and the final chapter), and a lot of stomach churning psycho babble from Maisie's teacher Maurice Blanche. There is even an utterly pointless character named, of all things, Khan. He's a blind Ceylonese mystic (OH BROTHER!) He's supposed to be a mysterious guru, but his main purpose seems to be to teach Maisie how to breathe properly. The final scene where Maisie solves the mystery is absolutely ridiculous.Still I wouldn't go so far as to say that it is ""unreadable."" A ""nice"" book, but not compelling enough to recommend it."
3,Rave reviews???,"I bought this based on the rave reviews it received. But the book was so predictable and incredulous! At one point, I wanted to stop reading it altogether.If her next book is anything similar, I will not buy it."
2,Disappointed,"I loved the beginning of the book but soon realized that, of course I would, since I am all about blue bloods and private libraries..I started to get bored by the time Maisie was being tutored and by the end of the book I was yawning.This plot has been done over and over and over with the same protagonist I am sure.A very cliched book and I am not eager to learn one new thing about Maisie."
3,For adolescent girls only,"The ""Maisie Dobbs"" series, while nicely written, is basically Nancy Drew transported to England during World War I. There is little to nothing to hold the attention of an adult, but young girls may be captivated by Maisie's strong spirit, love of education, a desire to prove she is just as good (if not better) as any man, and her budding (though safely sexless) romances. All very pleasant stuff and may hold the attention of especially younger adolescents.UPDATE:A friend who is an adult and not a ""younger adolescent"" owns all the Maisie Dobbs books and tells me I am full of beans. She could be right. If you buy books through Kindle (as I do) you can just download a sample and decide for yourself for free."
2,"Eh. Not bad, but not as good as touted, either.","This won an Alex (young people's library award) NOT an Agatha. It was also nominated for an Edgar. This is hardly suprising given the author's lenghthy experience in the publishing industry, and the numerous contacts which she has as a result.As one prior reviewer noted, the dialogue and characters do owe much to Barbara Cartland. However, let's remember that Barbara Cartland made millions on her predictable stories and is now a Dame of the British Empire.I think your opinion of this story will depend on your ability/willingness to suspend credulity and believe in the numerous coincidences which are the backbone of the plot. Personally, I thought the charcters were cliched, albeit well-researched.Is it worth reading? Sure, borrow it from the library and take it to the beach. Then you can decide for yourself if you should plunk down money to buy it, and even more importantly, give it precious shelf space. (I wouldn't.)"
5,maisie dobbs,"""Maisie Dobbs"" is simply of a higher caliber than most mysteries. The writing is great, Maisie the character is likable at once, & the mystery is first rate. I loved how the author used WWI as part of the mystery. The London setting post WWI was another plus, as I have had trouble finding books set during this time period. I intend to continue with this series."
4,Charming Historical Whodunnit,"In many ways, this book was a delightful blend of ""Brideshead Revisited"" and an Agatha Christie mystery. Maisie Dobbs is a terrific character. She is complex without ever being pompous and Winspear throws her into a difficult social conundrum that she may never escape from. The book's moments of levity are balanced by some bleak truths about war, and I admire the depth that these darker passages brought to the narrative as a whole. I plan to read the rest of the books in this series."
3,Maisie Dobbs,"A charming, light story that is pleasant and an easy read. The book is relatively short but worthwhile. The character developement is well done and gives clear pictures of the dementional parts of each of the players in the book."
5,Great introduction to a new breath of fresh air,"Maise is a new character in the stable of mystery book sleuths. She is refreshing because she is different from many of the other characters that have been offered up. She is a smart woman, who has an emotional side, but is able to maintain both for her own benefit. She is also someone who was able to span two different classes in her world, and is able relies upon hard work and training to get results. This book is the first installment in the Maise franchise, and is a winner as it offers an interesting story and a well written book. It is never boring, never convoluted, and never at a waste being interesting. All in all, it is a very good read that will call to you to read more. Guess what? You'll answer because you will be caught up in fast moving story containing a compelling main character. Get it and enjoy!"
4,A Nice Change of Pace,"This was a new direction for me. I have read very few historical mysteries, but I really do enjoy this time period.Maisie Dobbs is one of those stories that I really enjoyed. I listened to the unabridged audio and was enchanted by the narrator and the story. But the odd thing is, I can't quite tell you why I enjoyed it so much. The mystery aspect was not quite as apparent as with most contemporary mysteries and this story had a lot more personal stuff than what I usually like.However, I could not stop listening and when the audio ended, I was very sad to not have more. But wait...there is a whole series of Maisie Dobbs books and I can read them all.Maisie's supporting characters are quite colorful and really do help enhance the story. The time period and the author's descriptions make the story even more enjoyable. I have already purchased book 2, but am trying to pace myself."
4,Different than you would expect,"This was my most recent book club read. I went into it thinking it was a mystery, but there is very little mystery in it. However, I really liked this book. I didn't love it, but I really liked it.The story takes place in the early 1900's and it is about a young girl who is very smart and gifted and how she is given a chance at an education. It is her story of overcoming the lower class and making something of herself. She becomes a private investigator and the mystery is in her current case and ties back into her time serving as a red cross nurse in the war and her true love. Nice story. Nicely written."
4,Good series to consider,This book was well written in an effective literary style. It was a bit slow in parts but overall gave you an interesting look at social classes and how WWI changed things. It also gave you an exciting ending that pulls you into wanting to read the next book in the series.
4,World War I England,"The primary character in this story is Maisie, a private investigator whose rise from the servant class is due to careful mentoring by her upper class employers. The second character is World War I, seen over time from the horrors of the battlefield to the devastating legacy it left on the minds and bodies of the survivors. Maisie too served in the war as s nurse, and her empathy for the ex-soldiers leads her to investigate an establishment where their lingering traumas are in danger of being exploited. Maisie's complete life is told via a series of long, rather maudlin flashbacks. There is considerably more depth in Winspear's details about ""upstairs and downstairs"" life, her accounts of the war and its aftermath, and in Maisie's physiological approach to her new found trade."
3,Tuff Luck - self-titled (Conquest),"Looks to be the band's sole effort.Decent sleaze glam metal from the '80's available now on a nice CD reissue.It seems that 'tough luck' is JUST what Tuff Luck experienced with this self-titled disc as it didn't really do very well.Tracks that sort of stood out were ""Tonight Tonight"",""Stranger In The Night"",""Out On The Run"" and ""Sad And Lonely"".The music is fine,just bad timing,I guess.Might appeal to fans of Slaughter,Tora Tora,House Of Lords and Faster Pussycat."
3,A Little Boring,"When i bought this book, i payed quite a lot for it. I found it a little unchallenging, an overall good buy, but not one for the ambitious. The pieces are all a bit easy and when it says beginner to intermediate, ""House of the Rising Sun"" wasnt that difficult."
4,Wonderful track,This track is fantastic. My son loves it and it is made of good construction. I am getting ready to buy him some more. I am so glad that I have found this train track.
1,Buy another brand,"Melissa and Doug train track is the poorest quality on the market. Many pieces barely connect and rather than a machined piece they use a cheap plastic peg. Go for imaginarium, lionel, or thomas."
5,Realistic Pet Portraits in Colored Pencil IS A REALISTIC VALUE,Outstanding book. Excellent results obtained immediately after just briefly reviewing the first few chapters. Wonderfully effective techniques. Easy to learn. Excellent format! I've been an Illustrator/ Artist for over twenty-seven years. I highly recommend this book.JF Willis
5,ONe of my favorites,"I love this book. As an avid colored pencil artist, I refer to it frequently. I love to draw animals, and Anne gives great suggestions on how to achieve the realistic textures in fur, feathers, horse eyes, dog noses, cat whiskers....YOU NAME IT... Her basic exercises can be applied to drawing anything in colored pencil. It is very structured, some may even say too structured, but I think it is a great way to teach techniques. If you want to draw animals, this is a good addition to your library."
2,"""Realistic"" Pet Portraits in Colored Pencil","This book would be less misleading if the ""realistic"" were left off of the title. The drawings are good illustrations, say for a children's book or the like. There's actually a couple included drawings that I had to wonder why they were included because they looked like good drawing for someone in highschool. Anyway, it may help if you really are just beginning to draw, but it was not what I had hoped for at all. If you want to see amazing colored pencil drawings and some interesting techniques, I would recommend the ""Colored Pencil Solution Book"" by Janie Gildow and Barbara Benedetti Newton.Colored Pencil Solution Book"
2,Watch,I would recommend this watch if you like bulky watches. My disappointment was that when I returned it I was charged $10.00 dollars and I had to call in order to get my account credited.
4,One of the Greats,"Like others, I read this to my homeschooled children. After reading this book, I probably appreciated Archimedes more than they did. For adults and children alike, this is a great introduction to one of the world's (not just the ancient world's) analytical thinkers. This book presents a good mix of scientific education and humanizing biography. We learn that Archimedes died too soon as the result of a stupid misunderstanding, and the world was denied the other scientific advances that he could have given us."
4,"Good, educational book","This is a good book about the life of Archimedes. It can be dry at times, but I don't know how one could make his biography more interesting. My son really enjoyed the chapter on the war machines. The chapters are quite short, especially after the first few."
5,a love story about waste and academic investigation,"The more I read of Delany, including his theoretical, non-fiction and autobiographical work, the more I recognise the incredibly skilful way in which he TRANSFORMS his experiences and desires into fiction. This book is a love story. Those who finish the book may agree with me; those who baulk at the sexual practices vividly (and, to non-enthusiasts, overwhelmingly) described may be baffled by this comment. Yet description of the central character's excitement in the gradual merging of his two interests (philosophical investigations and sexual investigations) is an extraordinary ride through emotion, thought and language. Times Square Red/Blue has hints of where some of the ideas came from. Bread and Wine probably more. This is Anti-Pornography - see The Scorpion Garden in Straits of Messina - a Queer affirmation and celebration. Read it for the superb writing as much as for the story, the politics, the sex."
2,No! It's Can't Be!,"Do you remember the Rolos of several years ago? The Rolos with chewy caramel in the center? Well, that's all changed now. Whatever is in the center is neither chewy, nor caramel as you and I know it. These are not your mother's Rolos."
4,K&N filter,"I just installed the K&N filter in my 2007 Chevy Uplander. K&N says that tere will be a horse power increase. I don't feel a noticeable difference. However the main reason why I purchased the filter is because of its long life. If you own a Chevy Uplander, you know that changing the air filter can be a real chore. Therefore I would say that I am happy with the filter and its price. In the long run it is more economical."
5,Designed well for standard vehicles,"This filter will never see the kind of wear and tear it was designed for.(I'm guessing.) It fit exactly without any problem. This is my second purchase of K & N air filters and while I haven't approached the 100,000 mile warranty that they offer the first has about 20,000 miles on it and it still looks like new.I like these filters because over the life cycle of any vehicle they will save you money in parts.(If you figure that you check/replace an air filter everytime or every other time you change your oil @ approx 5 to 15 bucks a pop then a total of 60, for the filter, cleaning supplies and the special spray oil, you will end up saving money by not having to drive for the filters and buying the new filters. so that's 2 cost saving right there. On top of the claim of better gas mileage.(which I have not tested.) So over all you can't go wrong with it."
5,Wonderfull book!,"I reccommend it! If you like Rodin, this book is for you. It's better then I hoped. All information you can find here, very big pictures, published very nice.."
1,I hated this book! I would not recommend it to anyone.,"I bought this book because I tend to like worthless trivia and find random facts interesting. I was disappointed. There are some interesting lists at the beginning, and a couple at the end, but the majority of the book is just plain boring. So boring, in fact, it took me over a year to read it! I am not inspired to check out the website. If you are a pub quiz aficionado, this is the book for you. If you read trivia for interest, give this one a miss."
5,"Powerful, stripped down rock & roll!!","Seems there is a lot going on in Europe and the Scandanavian countries these days. This is powerful, stripped down rock & roll. Very strong writing, vocals and musicianship. Hard hitting, in your face. Sounds a bit like an uptempo version of Brand New Sin. I'm hoping that this is not a one time side project. Highly recommended."
4,An Unexpected Treat!,"When I heard about Chrome Division, I was a little skeptical. After all, the most notable related act, Dimmu Borgir, can be a little corny in their music, and I was worried that the presence of Shagrath might direct the music on this album in that sort of direction.My worries disappeared on my first listen. No cheese here, folks. Just killer, gritty, hard, dirty rock n' roll, a la Motörhead.If what you liked about Dimmu Borgir were the blackened vocals, this may disappoint you.If what you liked about Dimmu was the use of symphonic music, this may not meet your needs.But if you like speed metal and hard, bluesy rock n' roll, then this will most certainly fit the bill. Great vocals, that really match the style of music, killer guitar and some great rock solos, good use of drums to set the atmosphere...it's all here, and this album just plain rocks!"
2,For Novice Only,The book provides very little engineering data. Hobbits who are interested in playing with a model for fun may find the book amusing. Engineers who are interested in designing Stirling machines will find it useless.
1,Does Not Deliver,"I was told on many occasions that this product would be perfect for my nails, but it failed to deliver. I believe the true test of the strength of any nail harder is to test on a teacher's nails for one day or two. My OPI nail color didn't last at all and chipped constantly. OPI needs to test its polish and strengtheners etc. on teachers who subject their hands to chalk etc for 185 days and then determine if their product really works. It was a waste of hard earned money."
5,AWESOME!,"I origninally purchased this album on tape and have been looking for it on CD. The tracks on this album thump with authority. If you want very low, very loud, bass you can feel... Bass Quake is the one you need. I was shocked the first time I heard it on a system with a sub-woofer, Earth shattering!!!"
1,poor product,"I purchased this for my three year old for christmas. It only lasted a two weeks before the magnets became disloged and from that point on it would not ""grow"". And there is no way to fix this problem. I'm sure this would be fine for the child who does not drop any of their toys!Good luck with yours if you purchase this item! He did like it for the two weeks it lasted."
2,"Seemed like a good idea, but eh","I was sure my two year old son, who loves both giraffes and counting, would love this toy. He doesn't. He has a hard time operating the drawer and fitting the cubes in. The button which advances the cubes doesn't always work. The cubes aren't magnetic or well fitted and the giraffe isn't well balanced, so all the cubes and the giraffe head frequently tumble down. Even I get annoyed playing with it, and I have more patience than my toddler.Two thumbs down."
2,Not captioned,"I bought this dvd for my hearing impared son. The lable says ""closed captioned"" but it isn't. Tried every which way to access the captions with no success. My son's worn a hearing aid since he was 2, he's now 34. No captions was a very big disappointment."
5,very intersting,I really enjoyed reading this story. I loved the detail of every day life of the homesteaders. I gave it 6 stars because of the history in this book. Loved it.
4,Foxfire,This book was interesting and told of the hard times two sisters experience in the West in Indian Territory. I found it particular interesting as I had visited the area several years prior.
4,Bryan Duncan & the Neho Soul Band: Music City Live,"Entertaining, hand-claping and in the groove. If you've never had a chance to catch'em live, here's your chance... Inlightening, toe-tappin' and a'lil bit-a-soul... Not the best camera angles but still a ton of fun..."
3,spliff-core!,"a weird artifact from the glory days of jersey hardcore. this band shared similarities with bands like Youth Of Today and Judge, but what set apart Hogan's Heroes was their decidedly west coast sound and style. using alot of influence of dub and reggae (and straight up pop), this band worked out a series of scattershot songs that, at times, do carry alot of intensity, but there are lots of others songs that fall flat with some embarassing interludes, delving into romantic verse and some misdirected shout outs to jah. but despite the goofy direction of this group, this cd holds some sentimental value for me."
3,"Good reminders, nothing new or surprising","This is a video of a lecture delivered on stage at Albert Hall, London. His Holiness sits (cross-legged on a chair) and speaks into the microphone, occasionally calling upon his interpreter for help with a difficult word or sentence. The DL is a beautiful and wise man, but do not expect any revelations or revolutionary ideas. He talks about what you, if you have any interest in watching the DVD anyway, already know and believe. There are no subtitles available and his Tibetan accent is at times quite dense, so I missed a word or phrase here or there. All in all, a thoughtful and pleasant hour and a half."
4,dark psychological true story,"The style is dry, as has been pointed out, but the story is very thought-provoking. I thought it was an interesting analysis of people's motives and what makes people do stupid things...[meaning, perfectly logical organized things that completely defeat the purpose of what they are supposed to be doing.] The reviewer who said it was about an event and not people was mistaken; it's very much about the people. However, the style is crisp and sounds more like a report than a narrative. The ending is somewhat predictable, but that is mostly because everything builds up to it. I have not seen the movie, but I think the book was worth reading and thinking about."
3,"Captivating Short story, thats not missing much",This novel was very nice for a quick read and is an amazing story. The characters were not something to rave about but the plot was very nice. I believe it could have been written with a little more suspense because the surprise ending seemed like it wasnt up to its potential for surprise and excitement. But anyone who says this was a bad book because it lacked detail are overly exxagerating.
4,ONE OF THE Best,"I thought this book was great. It's clearly one of the best books I've read. After reading a few chapters of the book, I got really into it. It's ending is awsome and unexpected. though it could have used a little bit more dialouge and more explanation in some parts of the book."
2,Rent the movie and save some time.,"This novel is very ""cut-and-dry"", meaning, the pacing is very rushed, and the characters lack depth. Upon finishing it, I felt as if I'd just read a news article. Of course, it's based on a true story, but I would have expected the novel to contain more characterization and explanation of motives. Unfortunately, this was a novel about a fascinating EVENT; the characters were obviously secondary. The ending twist is very good, but it's just a shame there wasn't any real build-up to it. You will be more pleased with the movie, a true classic."
3,Brittish propaganda,"Come on guys....The book is written in a matter of fact style that is neither terrible nor inspiring and the story is OK, although predictable from the very beginning. The worst part though is the author's continuous praise of the British - both how great the British officers are and how exceptional the common enlisted man is. Give me a break. The style is similar to other books written at the time so I can't ding it too hard for that but for the propaganda alone this book should be two stars. I give it three because of its status as a classic. Something maybe you should read so you can form your own opinion."
4,Distilled Irony,"A great classic, in the tradition of Conrad's Heart of Darkness. This book could have been much longer, the author could have written hundreds of paragraphs of descriptive imagery, explored the relationships between the principal characters in greater detail, but didn't, thus adding to the fable quality of this narrative.The story presents us with a concise portrait of one of the most basic motives of the human animal - the desire to do something great. Whether it is more noble to build or destroy is a question the reader will have to decide for himself."
4,Personal Desires Clouding the Big Picture,"Bridge Over the River Kwai is a very interesting novel depicting the true story of POW's from a Japanese Labor Camp who are forced to build a bridge for the Japanese war effort. Although the novel can be dry at times, the descriptions of camp life and the grueling work conditions come alive, putting you right there in the thick jungle next to some sweaty G.I.s. Plus the underlying issue of personal desires getting in the way of the big picture (the Allied war effort) is undeniably strong and is a lesson in life that everyone should be exposed to. Bridge Over the River Kwai is a definite ""must read"" in my opinion."
1,definitely not Fields,"I have to disagree with the first poster here who gave this album 4 stars. Being a die-hard FOTN fan, I bought this when it first came out in the early 1990s. I was completely disappointed- the singer who replaced Carl was awful and he sounded like he didn't belong with the band. From what I can recall (I no longer own this CD) the singer's voice reminded me of some bad 80s hair band vocalist. Perhaps this is why Rubicon never made a second album and the rest of the band went on to other projects. For all those out there who love the old style Fields, don't bother with this because you will only be disappointed."
2,"Good on theory, light on application","I've been doing spatial analyses for more than a decade with GRASS GIS but am always open to new ideas and approaches. This book fails to meet my expectations because it's all theory; written by academicians for academicians. For example, in the sections on spectral analyses and wavelets the authors briefly describe what each is, provide equations for generating the curves, but do not explain under what circumstances one would select this analytical approach over others, show how to apply it to real data (all data are contrived to better illustrate concepts), and -- most importantly -- how to interpret the results. Both authors are plant ecologists so there is no discussion of point data in animal populations, but that's a minor consideration. It's less a guide for the working ecologist than a reference source to the literature of those researching spatial analytical tools."
5,BRILLIANT,"With no money in his pocket and no visa in his passport, Hillman finds himself not in Ceylon, but in Athens. With no money and no job, he travels through Istanbul, Tehran and Kuwait. He finds work washing dishes, teaching English and even as a maitre de at a ritzy hotel. But most of the time there is no work, and Robert is forced to hitch rides, beg and barter his possessions to survive. Finally he ends up in a prison on the border of Pakistan, where he finally begins to see and accept who he is and to find the acceptance he has long craved.Intertwined with the travel tale are tales of Hillman's childhood and of his family, particularly his father's tale of struggle and sorrow. These stories show the reader where the young Hillman has come from and glimpse where he is going."
5,Not for those scared of rodents...,"Like many of King's stories, this one plays on a primal fear. This one happens to be rodents and, to an extent, bats. If rodents scare you, wait until you get a load of the Queen! I first caught this movie in a Stephen King marathon on some TV channel and was hooked ever since. For those who don't like it... Well, there's no accounting for bad taste..."
4,Stephen King's,"I typically don't like movies that have been adapted from Stephen King's books. Having said that, I did like this movie. Maybe it's because it was from one of his short stories, I don't know. One movie I hated was ""IT"". The book was awesome, the film[...]. Anyway, back to this film, a drifter (Hall) wanders into a small northeastern mill town looking for work. He arrives at this mill and decides to request the open position of operating a picker machine. The boss (Mr. Warwick) is an asshole, and his co-workers are even worse. Hall begins to notice that this particular mill has a rodent infestation problem. This rodent problem is actually much larger than anyone at the mill knows. The mill workers eventually come together against their boss and the evil lurking in the mill's sub-basement. This film follows the story exactly. Great horror film."
3,This is how I feel by 8am....only 173 days left....,"This is not a review--- just thought I'd tell everyone about my first week on what they call ""overnights"" nowadays. It's not bad, just...different. As a manager, I get a lot less B.S. at night, all there is to do is get the freight out for the next day. Keep pushin' the crew, get the back room empty, drink 14 Red Bulls.... yeah, it's a party. And I bet some of my Amazon bros know what I'm talkin' about. Supposedly I'm back on days in Feb, so we'll see what's left of me by then.See ya kiddies---------NLD"
2,The Best Part Of The Film Is The Cover Art,"When I first watched this film, I was scared. Now days, it doesn't really matter to me. Still this movie is quite thrilling. This movie is more recommended to scare a twelve year old, other than a sixteen year old.If I wrote this review when I was twelve, I probably might have given it three stars. But I recently saw the film a year ago, and it wasn't scary anymore.Most of all, I like the cover art for the movie. The skeleton with the worker's hat tells you that nobody has ever survived the graveyard shift. It also tells you that the main thing to do is survive.This movie is the kind that you should rent if you're bored one night."
1,JUST PLAIN AWFUL!!!,"Even when stacked up against all those other lousy Stephen King movie adaptions, this is still one of the worst movies I have ever seen.These people aren't even trying to make a picture that is in the least bit watchable.If you haven't seen this movie, trust me, it's not worth a minute of your time. If you have seen this movie, you have my sympathies."
1,Weak Adaptation,"This is one of the worst Stephen King movies ever. I surely hope that he had nothing to do with the making of this movie. The only similarites between the movie and the short story are the big rats. The makers pumped this full of so much crap to make it movie length. The acting was weak and the premise was just stupid (if they could see the mill from the rat's ""lair,"" there's no way it would have gone undiscovered). Don't even bother. If you're interested at all, just get Night Shift at your library and read the 10 page story."
1,predictable horror film,"Graveyard Shift is a short story written by Stephen King that should never have been adapted to the big screen. It's about a giant rat-bat creature living underneath a basement. The idea is fine and creepy for a story but for a movie, its treatment is horrible. The acting is sometimes good, and sometimes really bad. The characters were so one-dimensional it was hard to care if they were killed or not. Either way, it seemed pretty likely who was going to be alive by the end of the film The rat-bat creature looks pretty real, and that's the only positive thing about this movie."
1,ANOTHER STEPHEN KING REJECT,"This movie is very slow paced and repetitive,it starts out with a factory worker talking to rats and putting them in a cotton machine then he falls in. Its basically about a city with rat problem and a stupid redneck exterminator. Very slow and boring and another bad Paramount DVD even worse than My Bloody Valentine."
1,better then that there sody pop can,"You've got to be kidding me. The main villian in this movie has an accent from the piney South that grates on the ears like a nail file slathered in acid. Example: ""This is Warwick. WHoooooTT?? cOME HEEERE, BOY. Postman come knockin' at you dooooorrrrr. Tell me a college boy like you don't needdd dooouuuubbbllel pay. We'll talk about that there thing latttahhh. Yo a driftah. And I get no guaranteees from a driftah. I'm not kidding you, these are some of the lines from the dialogue of this horrid movie. However, I did laugh my fanny off watching this supposed, horror flick, which is much funnier than your typical comedy..."
3,Makes You Want To Work The Day Shift,"From Horror master Stephen KIng comes this most terror filled tale yet.....Gates Falls, Main. When an abandoned textile mill is reopened several employees meet mysteriouse deaths. The Link between all the killings, they all occured between the hours of 11 pm. and 7 am. otherwise known as the graveyard shift. The sadistic mill foreman has chosen a group to clean up the mills rat infested basement, but what the workers find is a subterranean maze of tunnels lreading to the cemetary, and an unimaginable horror that comes alivew in the dead of night.This is a bare bones movie with no dvd extras, though the dvd itself and the artwork on it, are very cool. Not the best Stephen King movie, but definately not the worst."
3,It's a Stephen King story so I bought it despite the bad hype.,"Okay, I admit, I bought this because I am a King fan. The film could have been better in both the writing and acting field, but it's still entertaining. The cover is more exciting than the film itself, but it has its moments. The gore was its saving grace. Clearly this was a low budget to no budget film with little put into the overall effects. But my collection would not have been complete without it."
1,Graveyard shift,"Definetely not one of Stephan kings best, I've been a Stephan king fan for years and this movie sling with the book are among my least favorite. Not recommended"
2,Wasted Potential,"The setting of the old textile millwith its labyrithine underground lairis great.The large, man-eating rat-batrodent-thing monster is pretty good.But...Shouldn't a movies have a good plotand script and interesting characters?Yes, it should.This one doesn't."
3,"Like The Shining, King Needed To Step In.","This movie does have some good aspects to it. Like that Maine accent, remote isolated feeling, that uneasy feeling of being around rats alone, and that cute, well-built chick. However, Stephen King should have had more influence on the set. If he had any at all. It was a little thin in some instances. Overall, a good flick. Listen for the great audio loop during the credits. It is awesome. I only wish there was some sort ofsoundtrack to this movie."
3,One of the better adaptions of a Stephen King short story,"This film is better than other Stephen King short story adptions like ""Sometimes They Come Back"" and ""The Lawnmower Man"". It manages to keep you scared most of the way through.The plot is simple, men try to clear rats from textile mill, rats get monster to kill off men.Although some may complain that you only see the monster once, no good horror movie has ever shown the monster until the final show down at the end of the film, it keeps you in suspence.I think this film is up with the likes of ""Salems Lot"" and ""Children of the Corn"""
3,So-So,"My one year old wrote on the couch with permanent marker and this product took it right out! However, it has yet to work on red juice still on my carpet."
2,Does not work on urine odors in carpet,I saw that amazon had gave this a 5 star test and no way is it worth buying. It never changed the odor in my kids bedroom floor.
5,Lifesaver,"I have an in home child care, 2 dogs and 3 birds.I have tried just about every product on the market that is suppose to remove stains from carpets. I ran across this product and figured what the heck. Oh my gosh! am I glad that I picked it up. It has removed pet stains and stains from kids juice cups that nothing else would remove. I even tried it on some stains on clothing and it removed those as well. There is no longer anything else in my cabinet but Kids and Pets.Follow the directions on the bottle and you will have no porblems. There were some stains that had been there for a while, that took a couple of treatments to get out but they are now gone also."
1,Did not work,"I have used 4 bottles of this product, followed instructions and completely saturated the affected areas, and the odor is still there. I want to add that This is carpet that is only 7 mo's old and The urine odor is from a 14 month old puppy, who is now house trained."
5,Awesome cleaner for Pet and Kid accidents,"This product is great!!! I can't say enough about how well it works. My kids have ""tossed their cookies"" twice in my car and it doesn't even smell. i can reccomend this product !!!!"
3,Daddy Cool Rules,"Randomly came across their video on YouTube. Fell in love with the song, ""Eagle Rock"". Would be amazing to see the Black Keys do a remix of it. It is truly unique. Picture the Rolling Stones ( back when they were actually good) mixed with a little Grateful Dead.Rest of the album is made up of pretty bad covers of late 1950's songs. This surprised me because Eagle Rock sounds nothing like the rest of the album."
4,"Not What I Thought, but It was Good","I was looking for something a bit lighter, but found the book give details I wasn't looking for. Had numerous pictures of early Baguio."
5,Flawless,"Bought this item to use on my rack mounted mixer to enable me to leave it always plugged in. The right angle lowers the hight so the lid can be mounted on my rack. High quality materials and unlike cheap knock offs, the plugs stay tight!"
3,IT WORKS BUT . . .,"The screw that holds down the wire must be removed to insert all but the smallest gauge wire. Easy to lose, so work over something that will allow you to capture it. The gold ring above the screw fell out on some of my plugs. I am not stacking plugs, so it didn't matter to me. But it might to you."
3,Leela almost steals the show!!,"Overall the novel was a pleasure to read. Jim Mortimore is masterful at portraying Leela. The way Mortimore described the 4th Doctor's companion forced me to completely re-think of what I thought of her -- this aspect I found to be the most pleasant experience while reading the novel. There are many memorable moments in the book especially during the trip back to Easter Island. I did find, however, that some of the sequences were somewhat difficult to understand but near the end of the book it made sense. The novel had a well-balanced plot and the pace was consistent throughout."
1,One for Leela's History,"One star as we learn a bit more about Leela, yet her character is written as one step above a chimp in attitude and language. The first person narrative is very confusing as with over six major characters, you never know who is speaking until three lines into their speach, not to mention where they are in the story. Overall a minor sci-fi new concept but for me, the worst 4th Dr. book in my collection."
1,Disappointing Style over Lack of Substance,"The narrative is told in an extremely disjointed fashion for no discernible purpose, other than to indulge in rather tedious foreshadowing, or perhaps to disguise the fact that, told in a straightforward narrative style, the plot is tedious int he extreme. Additionally, for purists of the series, the character of Leela bears almost no resemblance to the series character and is portrayed more as if she is Superman's sister than a real human being. There is a sequence when she is in the ocean--fighting off sharks and giant squids, and hitching rides on whales and surviving tornadoes, etc., etc. that is simply too ludicrous for words. As with most of the Doctor Who novels put out by BBC Books (and, for that matter, the earlier novels from Virgin), it would also benefit from tighter editing and a reduced page count."
2,Yes and No,The only reason I gave two stars to this book is because of the insight into Leela's character. Leela's first person narative is very interesting. Read the first half and skim or skip the rest.
1,Doctor Pew,"This time out, Doctor Who trades in his TARDIS for a time traveling HONEY BUCKET and becomes Doctor Pew!"
1,A waist of time and money,"I would strongly suggest that the would be purchaser look else wear ! This book contains little of what the title suggests, and of that very little, most of the information is simplistic or out of date."
1,Not all that it's cracked up to be....,"If your looking for a book on wiretaps and surveillance transmitters....this is NOT the one. The book contains many common sense circuits and claims many uses for ""covert"" operation. The book also gives many partial plans, requiring that you buy the first book to complete a project. My advice: Save your money and get The Basement Buggers Bible. Now that is one quality book on the subject."
2,a little disapointed,"Waited a long time for this movie to be put on dvd and when I saw it ...I bought it. I enjoyed this movie when I was growing up and so did my brothers. It was and still is a funny movie to watch. But I must say I was a little disapointed in the transfer...although the picture transfer was good the audio was not ! in some parts of the movie the audio was not in sync with the video and it was very obvious, most noticable early in the film at the army base scene with the two soldiers who are fighting over a girls picture(really bad-looked/sounded like a bad martials arts movie overdub). I mean with todays technology and the price for it. They should have caught this glitch and corrected it before releasing it for sale. For this reason alone I give it only 2 stars ( Great movie- poor transfer ). Again disapointed."
1,Unwatchable due to woeful sinc.,"The synchronization is out by at least a second, rendering the movie unwatchable. Very disappointing, especially since this particular movie is very hard to get."
2,Skip It,"Good actors pick up their paychecks in a weakly scripted cop show. Plot elements are familiar to anyone who owns a TV. No suspense, zero surprises. Most viewers will find that they are better detectives than the characters on screen."
3,Pure Xstacy!,"The titile cut gets you in the mood for some fireside, plush rug and sweet wine nasty here. But when you hear the vocal ""We're In Ecstasy"" you better be ready for fireworks. This is not Laws' BlueNote and A&M; stuff, but it has got to be one of the best kept secrets of the 80's kinda MSOP funk you'll ever hear. Why it has escaped being digitally issued on CD will be one of the numerous WTH questios I have about the producers of much of the horrible stuff that coesm slip between the cracks. Warning, for me this is a side 1 vs. side 2 recordings. I barely play the second side, but have worn side 1 through to the next side. It IS a collector's item, since only two cuts have been cd issued on his Sony re-master series. The album art is even adult oriented if you view it with an ""open"" mind.This is a good buy for the Philadelphia Sound lovers out there."
2,not much to it,Really almost nothing here. The things are smaller in scale than other products from the same maker and it seems to be more cheaply made.
5,MY GRANDDAUGHTER LOVES THIS,"Bought many things for my granddaughter, who just turned two. My daughter-in-law said she loves this and plays with it everyday."
3,Not impressed,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my neice. I liked that it was food that mimics what we eat, and not the set with an abundance of junk food or canned food. I only saw the online images. For this price, I was expecting more. It came in a plastic bag, and looked like dollar store plastic. The other food by the same company looks like it comes in a little basket, this one does not. It does not come with a cutting board either."
4,Healthy Snack Food Set,"Most of the play food was very durable. I ordered 5 sets for classroom use. In all 5 sets, the yogurt containers arrived damaged."
4,good healthy play food,"We have been buying different play food, and were in need of some healthy snacks like carrots and celery. I also liked the idea of the milk container and yogurt. Everything is made well except the yogurt container, a little flimsy, and they only give you one piece of cheese.(but more then one cracker). Anyway, it's a cute set, but I would recommend getting a bigger set with more food groups and then adding this as an extra."
4,Snack time,"Got these for Christmas. Very realistic. Only 1 complaint and that is the size of some pieces but I guess they had to be small to be realistic. Overall a great product and my kids love it, but be careful if you have little ones that still put things in their mouths."
5,One of the few real classics,I spent numerous hours studying this book when I was in middle school. It is one of the best math books I have ever read.
3,"Fast delivery, but damaged product",The book was torn when it arrived. I was expecting a better product!
4,Just right for a big sedan trunk,"The trunk of our car is very big, so keeping groceries from falling all over the place, we needed this.Heavy enough to stay in place by itself. It seems to be well stitched and made to last. Velcro allows you to set the dividers where you want. It can be folded down/clipped shut, but we leave it up most of the time.Be sure to measure your trunk interior before purchasing. This can be slid to the front or rear of our trunk, not all car trunks are the same. Original cardboard package is wrapped in plain heavy cardboard for shipment. Arrived within estimated delivery date.Very happy with purchase."
4,"great construction, great product. but smelly.","but not THAT smelly. after reading a few other reviews i expected this thing to be horribly smelly out of the box. it does have a lite smell to it, but not that bad. i have it airing out in the garage right now after receiving it this morning. after being out in the open air for around 8 or so hours i can smell it, but not that bad. maybe they fixed the smell issue? we shall see.as others have said this is a great product. very very stout. great construction, collapses down great, the dividers are adjustable. for 50 bucks i think this is a great storage solution.*UPDATE* after it has sit in the garage a couple of weeks any smell it had is completely long gone. if you are scared away due to any possible smell dont sweat it."
4,Very good trunk organizer,This organizer works perfectly in my '09 trailblazer. I actually have two of them - one on each side running the length of the vehicle. There was no smell that others complained about. The only complaint is the anchoring system (or lack thereof) but the weight of the material i have stored in them keeps them in place; they have not moved over 10K miles of hard driving.
4,Good organizer for the trunk,"I wish the walls weren't so flimsy, but I love that it's configurable so I can fit groceries and other things in the organizer. Really solid, but it may be a little too expensive for the production materials used."
3,Didn't fit,Good construction and organization. Just didn't fit our 2006 Honda Ridgeline. It was too deep front to back. I guess we'll try another.
4,Great!,"This is a great product to help keep your vehicle neat and tidy. I would have given this product 5 stars if it was just a tad bit bigger (maybe an inch or two larger). Otherwise, it's exactly what I was looking for.Also, I have no idea what the other folks were saying about the oil smell. The product came out of the box with no funny smell at all."
5,Love it!,This really works well. No odor in mine like that reported by others. Stays in place well without tying it down. Seems really well built and durable. Like how the spaces can be customized to any position with Velcro.
4,Great but awful odor,"This product is functionally great but has a strong petroleum odor that is awful. I've had it sitting outside for days to dissapate the odor, but the smell is slow to leave. Hupefully, I will be able to use it in my wife's new car soon without her complaining.**Update 4 months later** The odor has completely gone. Very handy organizer in trunk. Each bay can be sized to hold two 1-gallon milk jugs and other groceries."
3,Great design but smells like roofing tar!,"Everything is great about this except it smells so bad. The treatment for the ""canvas"" is too much. Once it comes out of the box, take it out of the house and open it up and let it ""air out"" for at least a week.The product, functionally, is almost perfect and warrants a 5-star rating easily. Rugged and flexible; totally useful. But the smell subtracts 2 of those stars and that's being kind."
4,Worth the money,The only complaint is that it doesnt have an adequate anchoring system but the weight of the material i have stored in them keeps them in place most of the time except for groceries sometimes. It usually doesnt move even when I am driving agressively. This organizer works perfectly in my explorer. I actually want two of them so that when we take the other vehicle we are equally as prepared.
5,Great product!,"I really like this organizer. It has a rigid and heavy feeling bottom so it stays put and doesnt slide around. It has adjustable dividers that stay in place with velcro and outside pockets. It is nice sized and it fits lengthwise on one side of our mazda 5 with all 4 seats up, leaving the other side for hauling other stuff. I ordered it on black friday, when it was on sale for 40 some bucks, wish I ordered another at that time for our other car, not sure if I would pay 100 bucks/full price."
2,Not my favorite Madeline book,"This is not my favorite Madeline book. My daughter usually likes Madeline, but was not as keen on this one. It does not have a good flow of rhyming cadence that is present in the rest of the series. The story is also fairly random and does not have much at all to do with London. Madeline and the Cats of Rome is a much better option."
3,not my favorite madeline book,"i do love madeline; i love the prose and the illustrations. this entry into the series felt a little lackluster, and it was more on the story side.i am sure peoples of all ages will enjoy the illustrations, however the story felt incidental. i didn't feel like it had a purpose or any import to the madeline series as a whole.if you are looking for a nifty madeline book, please check out the others in the series. there are much more worthwhile entries."
2,Graphics not appropriate.,Some graphics were not appropriate. It took me about 5 minutes to thumb through this book and decide to send it back.
4,Excellent restoration,The restoration of the original is excellent. Although I was disappointed that there weren't any deleted or extended scenes. The documentary content was ok. This one is better than the 2012 version. Nobody beats Arnold!
4,love this version hate the 2012 version,"classic arnold. expected acting quality, decent ""futuristic"" forethought.action kept you going the whole time. I recommend watching this film over the new one!"
4,A Twisty Tale,"A twisty tale made from a Phillip K. Dick short story, and better done than the recent remake even if the special effects are not state of the art. Watch for the little details in conversation and in what is said on the tv screens behind the actors as they do all tie in along the way. Yes, a lot more action film than the original story had, but it makes it a better story in my opinion."
4,Funny Action Movie,"I used to watch this at least once a year when I was younger so its basically a nostalgic trip for me. The action is on par with other movies of its type at the time, the fluidity of the story is sweet, and it always keeps you guessing what is going to happen next. I swear every time I watch this movie I learn something new about the story, which can be confusing to some. Arnie also has some pretty outrageous scenes which are memorable. Well worth it for me"
3,Price Was About Right,"This movie was not transferred to BD very well. Lot's of artifacting or spots or whatever the experts call it. It was cheap and I didn't already have the movie so I didn't mind much. By far the worst looking of my collection. I have ""The Cowboys"" on BD which is a much older movie. It did not have the artifacting that TR did."
2,too violent. great plot.,unfortunate that he has to kill 10 guys to move onto the next scene in this movie....over and over and over.I love sci-fi and for that it gets the 2 stars.
3,Total Recall,"Okay, where do I start?1. Great movie. Super violence though very disguting, brutal, ane extremely bloody. But what can you expect when you see a movie with Arnold Schwartzenegger. Schwartzenegger acts great and so does Michael Ironside, great villain.2. HORRIBLE DIRECTING! It was just so plain. Again, what can you expect. VErhoeven is like 80 now. Still it was okay.3. Dumb. Some ideas were completely idiotic and hard to understand. Watched it over 50 times and still don't understand some parts.4. Kids and parents:THIS MOVIE IS RATED R:STRONG VIOLENCE, LANGUAGE, NUDITY(Sick idea with the women on mars having three....um....um.....well, you findout yourself."
1,Bad Blu-ray Disc,"This is a poor transfer of this film, snow (Faded Picture) over several scenes do not waste your money."
5,Great hidef quality,"We all know the movie rocks. What about the BluRay quality?This is an excellent, real hi-def movie (unlike the Terminator BluRay) with fantastic audio. I've saw the movie on the big screen, then on DVD. BluRay at home with a 5.1 sound system is the way to go. If you're a fan of Arrrnold, SciFi, Philip K. Dick (the movie is based on one of his books, We Can Remember It For You Wholesale) or action movies, then this disc is for you."
3,Just Get The DVD Version,"I always wondered how they made old movies into high def and the short answer is that don't. The movie was slightly (very slightly better than the DVD upconverted version).No special features, no reason to buy the Blu-Ray version. Just buy the DVD version for a fraction of the price and it looks the same.Great movie though :)"
3,Bargain...,I have read other reviews of this Blu-ray and many people are upset with the quality of the disc...so I was actually surprised that it looked as good as it did. I saw NO blocking or few artifacts so I'm not sure what going on with other peeps equipment - I am using a PS3 with a Panasonic AE-900U front projector and a 40 foot HDMI cable. The picture can look soft at times and fairly sharp at others so perhaps it's partially the source material. At any rate for 13 bones plus change it's a bargain given the high price of other Blu-ray movies. I don't own the regular DVD (I have it on laserdisc) so I don't regret buying this version.
4,"Great movie, lots of twists.","Total recall is a great thriller! It has many twists and turns, and the acting is superb. Predator will always be Arnold's best movie, but Total Recall is in the top six. Please note that there are some very, very, disturbing images that will keep you awake for weeks!"
3,Fun but not great,"The remake of TOTAL RECALL gave me an urge to revisit the original. I'm a big fan and devotee of Paul Verhoeven, but my second viewing confirmed my original opinion that this is not one of his better films.It still evidences Verhoeven's darkly satirical approach to American genre film making, but lacks the substance and satisfaction of ROBOCOP and STARSHIP TROOPERS. Still fun and a dazzling thing to look at, though."
3,Philip K Dick. Need I say more?,"Before Minority Report, there was Blade Runner. Between those, there was Total Recall. Sandwiched between two classic SciFi films, Total Recall seems to suffer from middle-child syndrome; a good story at the heart, but Verhoven's cliche' type violence poisons it a little. What is interesting is that Blade Runner's special effects hold up extremely well even when compared to Minority Report's state of the art technology (the Spinner flight thru the LA sky is still believable) but the cheezy ""Free Mars"" sfx of Total Recall is showing it's age. However, it remains an entertaining film and serves as a light escargot appetizer for the french onion soup that is Minority Report and the rare filet mignon that is Blade Runner."
2,Totally Awful Rubber Mutants!,"When Total Recall was first released, I dragged a friend to see it. I had seen the trailer and I thought it would impress others as it did for me. Big mistake! The movie started off great. The plot seem interesting and suspenseful. Then, some rubber mutant freaks came wandering and I was left pondering over the embarrassment for recommending the movie. This embarrassment includes a rubber puppet popping out of an actor's chests, a chick with 3 rubber breasts and some other deformed plastic all-sorts walking around the set. If only they hadn't used any mutants in the movie. This film could have been more mature and if it was, it might have been a great all-time sci-fi classic. Instead, it turned out like a kiddie's movie. Personal Opinion! Schwarzenegger still rules."
1,Blu Ray not worth it.,First off what people are saying about the quality is true. This is pretty much an upscaled DVD. If you can find the special edition DVD I think it has some actual extras like making of documentaries. The only thing like that that came with this blu ray that I got from Wal Mart for 6 bucks is a 3 minute documentary that has nothing to do with the movie at all.
1,Poorest Buray ever,"Oh, god. It's even worse than DVD.DVD, at least we don't see the stripes.When I first play this Bluray with my LG LED TV with Panasonic final version of Bluray player, I couldn't even see the whole movie.The grains are created, I think, while transfering, not in the original film for sure.This is the one title that should be re-released in the future.I urge you to keep the DVD and those who want to own this film, buy the DVD instead."
3,"Great concept, just too violent","I wish amazon.com had half stars because I would give this movie 3 and 1/2 stars. Anyhow, overall, this is not a bad movie. It has a great plot, good acting, a decent script, great sets, lots of action, and great special effects for 1990. The only thing I had a problem with was the excessive violence. If you can see past that, which I couldn't, you should enjoy this film. But hey, that's just my opinion."
2,Poor styling and dated sets...,"Nobody watches an Arny film for his acting - it's all in the action! So what's wrong with this film?Paul Verhoeven gives his usual best in sex and violence - problem is with the art direction. The interior sets for the Mars colony look just like that - dressed up sound stages. Compare it to the visual brilliance of films like City of Lost Children, Blade Runner and even Dark City... these films take the audience to another time and place, even after repeated viewings through the years.Total Recall just looks dated after barely a decade - styrofoam rock walls, plastic-looking doors, outdated hair styles... Just doesn't mesh well with the admittedly great SFX sequences. The magic is lost..."
2,"Total Recall,Blu-Ray","This was one Dvd upgrade I wasted my money on,sound quality much better,but picture quality was still grainy,don't waste your money on this one."
1,Classic movie; HORRIBLE HD transfer,"I love this movie but this is the worst Blu-Ray disc I've seen so far. Absolutely terrible transfer, has obvious blocky compression artifacts starting in the first scene and continuing on throughout the movie. Film grain is intact (a good thing) but there's a ton of jitter and film spots/hairs/lint etc. Looks like you're watching a bad print in a $1.50 movie theater. Scratch that, the compression artifacts make it look like you're watching a youtube video of a bad print from a $1.50 movie theater. Seriously, most DVDs have fewer compression artifacts than this.I want to make it clear that I'm not one of those people who insists that all films be cleaned up and vaseline-d for the digital transfer. I like gritty film grain and natural colors on films where that's what the director or the technology of the time dictated. This is simply a bad transfer. The compression artifacts alone kill it. Skip it, and wait for a better version."
1,Poor transfer to blu-ray,"This is a bad-transfer to Blu-ray. My DVD is just as good and has more extras also! Don't waste your money.EDIT: I would just like to add, this original post was several years ago and it was intended for the 1st edition blu-ray only. I love this movie, so I was merely commenting on the quality. I don't know why Amazon feels the need to lump all of the reviews together for a product."
3,Limited extras,The review by Wyatt must be for some version of this film other than the blu ray edition. The only extra on the blu ray edition is Visions of Mars.
3,"Not the best, but creative concept","I saw it when was new, but just right now I can get the DVD, to me, it is one of three movies where you can find the original concept used on Matrix, it's the reason why I think Total Recall is a great movie. (the other two are Dark City and Ghost in the Shell)"
3,OK movie.,One of the Schwarzenegger movies I can stand watching. For it's time it was a really good movie. That's all I really can say.
2,Dick must be rolling in his grave...,"""Inspired"" by the short story of sci-fi master Philip K. Dick, ""We Can Remember It For You Wholesale,"" this movie starts off as a mysterious, intellectual, and action packed thriller, up until the line ""Conseeder zis a divohse!""And then we go down from there.To its credit, it stays true all the way until Quaid battles his wife. While the story involves more and more possible true/implanted memories in Quaid while he strikes deals with the powerful government, the movie quickly goes to a Doom like shoot em up on Mars. What could have been a sci fi ""Memento,"" 11 years before the fact, turned out to be nothing than a Swarzennager blood bath. A pity."
2,Disappointing and dull.,"Arnold Schwarzenegger stars as Douglas Quaid, an otherwise ordinary man who discovers that his memories and his life are false, and the truth to his real identity is on planet Mars. The second of Paul Verhoeven's big-budget sci-fi actioners (The other films being Robocop, Starship Troopers, and Hollow Man), it's also his weakest. After a good beginning, everything goes downhill with repetitive action scenes that don't generate many thrills, and quite frankly, Schwarzenegger is just wrong for the role. Verhoeven's a fine action director, but his talent isn't showcased particularly well here. The final plot twist is a good shocker, however."
4,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:It's sometimes a little over the top, but it's a whole lot of fun and suprisingly thought-provoking for a movie that features Arnold Schwarzenegger and a woman with three breasts."
1,"DO NOT BUY THIS ""Blu-Ray!""","I feel completely ripped off and am pretty angry. When you buy a Blu-ray disc that says ""High Definition"" on the box, then play the f*@$ing movie and see it's the quality of a VHS tape, you got had.Don't buy this. My old DVD version of this movie looks better, and doesn't have all the flaws of dots, spots, and scratches from a bad film source.I want my money back."
1,Great movie - Terrible blu-ray disk!,"Total Recall is a great movie, lots of action, decent story line, its a typical 90's movie, very cheesy :)BUT!The quality of the picture on the blu-ray disk is terrible, I watched it on my PS3 with HDMI cables transferring the image to a Sony Bravia HDTV and there was very visible static / snow in lots of places on the movie.If you don't own another version for $14 it may be worth the purchase, but I wish I had read the reviews prior to ordering."
3,"Great movie, terrible quality for Blu-ray","This was one of my favorite movies when I was younger. I bought the DVD when it came out, and recently did the same with the Blu-ray version. I expected the Blu-ray version would have a better transfer, but I was wrong. It's better than the DVD, but not by far. From now on, i'll be renting Blu-rays before deciding to buy them as there haven't been any kind of quality standards set on this overpriced media."
4,Great action.,"It was fun to watch this again, was good action movie. Forgot how much they swore in those movies back then."
1,:(,It's not like in the picture. Not the REAL special edition like I was expecting. It's more like a cheap bootleg. :/
2,Disappointing,"Arnie usually puts out good action flicks, but something went wrong here! The story is decent.......but the action blows! And when has Arnold ever needed a good plot? Get T2."
1,"Terrible ""Accidental"" purchase. My bad.",Yuk! Grade C- movie. No redeeming features at all. I assume the remake is better. Deleted this old one from my library.
1,transfer,"I agree. This Blu Ray transfer is the worst Blu Ray transfer I've ever seen. The picture quality isn't any better than a VHS tape. Also, on the packaging and here on Amazon the aspect ratio is wrongly listed as 2.35:1. It is not. It is actually 1.85:1. I'd give the movie itself 4 stars, but my review here is just for the Blu Ray. Zero stars."
4,Total Recall,Tatol Recall - The original..... Nothing beats the original. If you like old sci-fi's you should like this. love it!
3,Total Recall: The good one,"Although this movie had the sexy Sharon Stone, I still couldn't help laughing at Arnold Schwarzenegger throughout the film. It's pretty good, probably better in it's time than in today's world, but kind of confusing if you think too much into it. I'd recommend it to people."
3,Total Recall original version,"The original version is so much better than the remake. The twists in the plot are not spelled out as if we are idiots like in the remake, there is more suspense and better actors and superb choreography. The picture as a whole is bright and the action is all in the open. In the remake it is all hidden in dark and shadowed scenes, clever camera angles, and the story line seems...well...poorly copied, so buy this version, the Original Total Recall!"
1,"great movie, HORRIBLE dvd.","I'm not a big video geek, and before when I saw people complaining about a horrible dvd transfer, I chalked it up to little details I couldn't see. *This* I could see. I liked _Total Recall_ the first time I saw it, and it is still a good movie. However the film quality on this DVD is really grainy and the color was off -- like they mastered it from a five year old video that had seen wind and weather. Just get the video."
3,What a disappointment!,I heard a lot of praise on this movie so I decided to watch it. It was one of the most disappointing movies I've seen lately. I thought the plot was dumb and characters had no depth. I didn't like anything except perhaps music. Total Recall is probably destined to be a film which I will never enjoy. I'm giving it 3 stars because I can see some honest effort there. But I really think it deserves 2 stars.
2,"Good movie, bad blu ray",The transfer from film to digital was not done well. The sound is fine but the video was disappointing. It is grainy at times. Artifacts from the old film stock were not cleaned up very well either. This one was rushed to have something to sell...
3,Total Recall,This movie displays new power when viewed in Blu-ray high definition format. I have seen this movie many times and wanted to add HD to my library of older movies. As with many futuristic movies the authors assume that the lower denomination of the human equation will go into space with the scientists and explorers. Although I hope this is not the case in reality. I hope that the people who venture to Mars are a bit more refined.
2,Another bad transfer,"Tocal Recall (Mind Bending Edition) in Blu-Ray.I am disappointed with the image quality of this release. Sometimes the video is beautiful, but sometimes it's too grainy and I can't accept it. This movie is not old enough and deserves more attention from the industry, which hasn't been showing respect with Blu-ray consumers."
4,A classic comes to Blu-Ray,"When I heard that there was a remake of Total Recall being done, I shuddered. This movie was such a cult classic and a great piece of sci-fi cinema...that news reminded me that I hadn't seen the original in ages. The Blu-Ray transfer doesn't disappoint. Awesome 1080 picture and digital sound bring Arnold's mind-erased everyman hero back to life."
4,Nice to recall Total Recall,"Got this as part of my collection of the ""past"" movies I grew up with. :) This is the BD approved by the director and I would say it is quite a nice HD restoration. Sounds is 5.1 and video is nice. Cant compare it with the new Total Recall but it is nice to watch again a movie with old technology to produce great movies!!!"
3,The movie is great. The video quality is extremely bad!,"This isn't a review for the movie. Chances are that if you're looking at this page, it's because you want to see it in the splendor of 1080p resolution. Well, save your money. The majority of the movie looks so horrible it's almost unwatchable! There is an unusually high amount of snow and grime in every scene. It's less noticable on the brightly lit scenes, but it's still there. If you own a Sony Bravia tv, the Bravia engine makes it all the more noticable too! It's amazing to me that Lionsgate would release such a low-quality Blu-ray disc! How did this quality escape happen?I would wager that the standard DVD version, when upscaled to 1080p, would yield a much better picture. Rent it first, or just avoid altogether."
4,good film,Arnold Schwarzenegger does a great job in this film.it's a cool sci-Fi film.it's held up real well.one of Schwarzenegger's best.the effects are still tight.
4,Total Recall (1990),"Paul Verhoeven's Arnie-boasting sci-fi saga is a whirlwind of violence and pace that investigates the connection between actuality and fantasy, and does so with swagger. Based on a story by Philip K. Dick, this film, which also stars Sharon Stone as Schwarzenegger's wife, was a great financial success (despite its then-huge $65 million budget) and added to the appeal of both of its star actors. As one of the more memorable articles of Contemporary Era science-fiction cinema, Total Recall is a worthy addition to your DVD (or even Blu-ray) collection."
2,Issues with sound quality,"I'm a huge fan of the movie, but the digital copy, like a lot of other digital media offered by amazon has sound issues. The volume can't be made loud enough to be played on certain media, like my xbox or kindle fire. It's all there, but for my xbox I need to have the volume on my TV at 99, and I still can't hear some things if there's any other background noise in my apartment, even a ceiling fan. The problem with the kindle fire can be reduced by putting in my headphones and blasting it to full volume, but without them I have the same problem. Also it would be nice if there was an option for subtitles."
1,Totally Foolish,"A huge dissapointment in the large part, and a total disgrace to the Science Fiction community. The film is plauged with mindless violence a very, very loose plot, pointless encounters with the bad-guys and horrible acting, not to say that Arnold Schwarzenegger is bad, just this film. If you like good action Science Fiction films, please for your own sake try one of the Terminator films first."
3,Its okay...,"Okay, I've watched the movie and the 'technology' of the time was great but now, not so much. The movie was ahead of its time but the rendering upgrade with blue-ray was not. I would only give this a 3/5 now due to the lack luster quality. If you own the DVD don't upgrade. The Oppo Blue-ray DVD player will upscale almost to this equivalent. Bought it to show my son because the new movie is coming out soon but should have rented it instead..."
1,This is a scam,The DVD is dubbed from a VHS source -- you can see periodic changes of the brightness and picture distortion. The movie is not watchable.
1,Worst Blu-ray I have seen...,"This is the worst blu-ray film I have ever seen. The graphics are terrible, so are the special effects, I really hope that their is a better version of this film sometime in the future. I recommend baying this film if you do not have a DVD version, but if you do I suggest investing your money into something else, because this is no better then the DVD."
1,Skip frames ruined this for me,"I bought this blu-ray version and I found out on AVS Forum the it is incoded at 24.00fps. The standard for the U.S. is 23.98fps. That means my blu-ray player will drop a frame after a few minutes. For me this is noticable to the point of distraction. It looks like the disc has skips throughout the entire movie. If this problem doesn't bother you or your Home Theater system is able to handle this, then, in my opinion, this blu-ray would be worth your while to get. Otherwise, don't waste your money."
4,Better than the remake that's for sure,Another Arnie classic that our family will watch over and over again. The remake of this movie doesn't hold a candle to the original. Amazon Instant viewing is priced right - good selection and a great way to build our video library on line for viewing anywhere.
4,I love Sci-fi!,One of the greatest sci-fi action movies ever and it's based on a Phillip K. Dick as many others are. I love this movie!
5,A Classic,Are you a lonely construction worker searching for a hot date? No you're really a hero of the Martian resistance want more data? Rent total recall. Very good with very memorable characters. Lots of blood and gore just the way I like it.
5,Total Sharon,"This movie was terrific, but Sharon Stone steals the show. She just looks absolutely stunning. This role, in my opinion is the best she has ever done. This definitely sets precendence over Basic Instinct. In my opinion all of the other characters should have given way to Sharon's character. This also includes the best girl fight in cinema history. It is well acted by her and if you only get one Sharon Stone film, let this be it!"
1,Schwarzenegger at his worst,"The worst movie I have ever seen.I absolutely hate this movie. It has no plot, poor character development, and an awful story line. If you have too much time on your hands and nothing to do with your life, I highly recommend this movie for you."
3,Fun Sci-fi,"I just streamed this film, after having not seen it in ages. CGI being what it is today, the special effects used in this movie, which aren't CGI, don't quite hold up in comparison, but that's ok because they now give this film a comedic sci-fi look. This actually makes it a bit more entertaining. That being said, the story behind this is very interesting, and this film makes for some good Saturday afternoon entertainment.This film is a classic in the sci-fi genre for good reason, the premise is so interesting, and the delivery unique.The film is a bit campy, but that's what makes it fun, and why I enjoyed watching it again."
1,Open your mind and close your wallet!!!,"Mind-Bending Edition is ""REKALL"" right. You have to ""BENNY"" bend your ""KUATO"" mind in order to see this horrible ""HOUSER"" transfer in ""MELINA"" Blu-Ray quality. We should demand our ""MARS"" money back to say the least. A free exchange needs to be made available when the REAL ""DOUGLAS QUAID"" BLU-RAY is released."
1,Definitely not science fiction,"I've seen cheesy and I've seen wannabe with the difference between the two being the level pandering to a more intelligent audience. This movie is definitely for guys that like to get their Shakespeare from WWF. Schwarzenegger's best movie will ever be Terminator. If he could have ended with the classic ""I'll be back"" and not really come back to make any number of horrid films we might actually have some decent science fiction. Last good science fiction I saw was Gattaca. Total Recall definitely ain't science fiction and isn't even very good action as compared with say the mindless gore of predator. Now that was action you could taste and you knew there wasn't much pretense of science fiction going on. I'd give Total Recall a 0 or less but they only let me enter a 1."
1,porn,"Paul Verhoeven started as a pornographer in Europe and he has not changed at all. Not surprisingly he has flourished in today's Hollywood. Total Recall is a putrid mess that is designed to appeal to the lowest common denominator on every possible level. To call this thing a Science Fiction film and therefore place it on the same level as Planet of the Apes or Destination Moon or even The Giant Claw is obscene as the thing itself. The thing completely embraces the nihilist philosophy of Communism. Humans are disposable trash. There is no good nor evil, just the right idealogy. Mass murder is only bad depending on whose side you're on. Life is death. To be fair, verhoeven IS consistent. Everything that he has made, from FLesh and Blood, up to his blasphemy of Heinlein's Starship Troopers has had the same stench of hell. To think that this is what American film has degenerated into."
3,New or not?,I thought it was the one being talked about but it's an old movie. It's okay I guess. The other one must be a remakr then.-Alex
2,"Oh, how movies have changed . . .","Wow. I did not remember this movie being this cheesy. Just saw the new version with Colin Farrell which I totally enjoyed, so I wanted to see how the original compared. Nice to see that some remakes are an improvement on previous versions. I remember enjoying the Schwarzenegger version when it was out, but that was a long time and many great technological advances ago. Still love the full-body scanner scene in this one! I remember is being quite the thing to see back then and I still get a kick out of watching the skeletal images walking thru the scanner."
2,Cool but kind of gross,There are some cool parts. It's not a bad movie. But he joins up with mutants that have really bad physical defects. It's kind of gross actually. Not that I don't care about defective people. It is sad. But they should at least be sterilized to try to put a stop to that.
1,THE WORST BLU-RAY RELEASE EVER,"I think the subject title says it all,,, What were they thinking, The young Sharon Stone looks like she has moving nano robots all over her naked body in the second chapter. The opening title sequence will light up the room like a late 70's disco. But the you cant add enough color even on plasma to give Arny a nice tan in the Recall office!My first review ever!"
4,Total Recall DVD,This is a movie the whole family liked when it first came out.When the new movie was released my sons kids had not seen it.That is the main reason I ordered it for them. They loved it.
1,A complete Hi-Def Rip-off!,"This is a Blu-ray disk, but ""Total Recall"" is NOT a high-definition transfer! The picture quality is at best as good as a regular DVD, but is often very grainy with faded colors and much worse that a DVD picture. This is a complete rip-off and greedy Lionsate should be ashamed of themselves for pawning off this shoddy, low-quality transfer as hi-def Blu-Ray. What a disappointment. ""Total Recall"" would be beautiful in hi-def, too bad Lionsgate is too CHEAP to do the job right."
5,Blu-ray brings a classic back to life,"For those who complain about the quality, I don't know what kind of equipment they were watching this on, but I've seen my fair share of blu-ray movies and this one was right up there.Clear colors and nice sound - we had a blast reliving this movie from the past. I highly recommend it!"
2,This Blu-ray should be Totally Recalled!!!,"As someone who honestly reads and appreciates the opinions of fellow Amazon buyers I have to WARN my fellow consumers. This is the worst transfer I have ever seen. Honestly there are artifacts and what appears to be interfearence(like when you run your vacuum, if your system is not grounded properly)all over the place. It is especially bad during the beginning when Arnold is with Sharon Stone but it is awful the full way through. I love this movie, but the transfer has got to be improved!!!"
1,"good movie, horrible blu-ray","If you have the dvd don't dare to buy this garbage. I am not talking about the movie. Movie is great.PQ is horrible, there is not difference between dvd and blu-ray.I almost threw it away. Garbage.I am very disappointed with many blu-ray quality. I don't know if I'll buy blu-ray again.Garbage, garbage, garbage. Stay away from that."
3,Great movie. Not so great transfer.,"As my title suggests I like this movie, but as far as Bluray goes, the transfer is only as good as the standard dvd.Unless you just want this Bluray for the low price and are not the type who can really see a difference between standard definition and high definition, wait for a better transfer."
3,Entertaining,"The director miscast the two female leads. Sharon Stone should have been the girl on Mars, and not Arnold's wife.None the less, it is entertaining and worth renting."
2,"Great movie, horrible blu-ray","Everyone knows this is an awesome movie... but the blu-ray has nothing BUT the movie! No director/actor commentary, no deleted scenes, NOTHING! Whoevers idea that was should be fired."
2,"Great movie, Horrible Blu-Ray",I purchased this Blu Ray as one of my first with my player. I turned it on and thought it was the cable or something was set up incorrectly. The brightness in some parts of the screen goes up an down with a white grain - The horse in the beginning looking like she is running in a rain storm. After spending 2 hours trying to fix the new player I tried a different Blu-Ray disc and was incredible.We tested the HD DVD version of Total Recall and the conversion is like Terminator 2 from the UK that is flawless like a jaw dropping movie effects show where special care was given to the grain in addition to remaster to highlight the shows performance. I am very disappointed with the Blu Ray version. I hope they read this and will fix for future presses as people deserve more like the HD DVD version. This one deserves to be at the dollar store.
3,"Not `total fun', but fun nonetheless...","You have to know what you're getting into with a film like `Total Recall'. My guess is that you do. If you pick a DVD with the name Schwarzenegger in bold letters at the top then you know that the talent level is very low, but it will be explosive and entertaining. `Total Recall' is just that. The acting and plotting and general storytelling aspects of this film are marginally successful, with moments of full blown ridiculousness, but the film is exciting in all the right areas and it maintains a level of cleverness that will keep you glued. The graphics are top notch (if not a tad on the cheesy side at times) for the time period in which this was made, and the action sequences are all pretty fun. As far as the story is concerned, well a lot of Arnold's films seemed to be cut from the same mold, and this is no different. Still, if you have a lazy Sunday afternoon prepared for it, `Total Recall' can bring with it a fairly good time."
3,Blurry Movie,Wish that I had bought the DVD instead. Bad quality in video viewing.I would say that Total Recall from the 80's with Arnold is better than the new Recall. That's just my opinion.
2,disapointing,Cute stuffed animal but not such a great web-site. The selling point was the web-site but a big let down. Signing in to the site not so kid friendly.
3,Cute toy that usually does not get played with.,This web kinz is cute. But because webkinz is really selling you a code to enter their site. The animals do not get played with as much as the site when you can get on the site or when it does not kick you off.The webkinz server goes down quite a bit.
5,I am sick of the Negatvity of Webkintz and Ganz,"My daughter adores her Seal and just received the Polar Bear today and the expression on her face was 'Priceless'. How cute! She has her pets sit with her while she gets on the Webkintz site. For the price and value of what you are getting it is Awesome. How do you NOT register on a site and expect to get the full enjoyment of PLAYING, LEARNING AND EXPERIENCING TAKING CARE OF YOUR NEW PET. SO WHAT IF YOU HAVE TO BUY ANOTHER PET TO CONTINUE YOUR REGISTRATION AGREEMENT AFTER 12 MONTHS, IT IS SO WORTH IT! GIVE ME A BREAK!WEBKINZ - Seal"
5,best birthday gift ever,"This is the best gift ever for a child who is learning computer skills and responsibility. They are mobile and cuddly. My kids each have one, and they love it!!!"
2,Cheap craftmanship,"Expected quality of webkinz I've purchased in past, but this was smaller than expected, and much less well made. Pink ""fur"" was sparse and uneven. Not cute OR cuddly. Very disappointed. Makes me regret purchasing items on line!"
4,Very helpful,"Very helpful in reviewing F&E. Concise, to the point, keeps everything compartmentalized for you. A big help for a difficult subject for new nursing students."
3,Great book but answers to questions conflicting,"After completing questions at end of chapter, I used the computer disc to retake the quizzes. Questions were the same, but not the answers. A little confusing for someone preparing for a F&E test or studying for NCLEX."
4,A gentle tale of redemption,"How do we reconcile with the mistakes we have made in the past? This is a thought provoking story about a man's struggle to make amends for a murder he committed impulsively as a youth. Instead of distancing the viewer, the film suggests that we are all capable (if not guilty) of regrettable acts, and goes on to explore the ways a person can be of use in the world as opposed to merely ""taking up space."" The film has a meditative quality and a deliberate pace, but is very absorbing nonetheless. An excellent cast and moody soundtrack complement the screenplay. The only reason I didn't give five stars is that the plot is a bit cliched, and the main philosophical soliloquy is inexplicably recited verbatim twice in the film, so it begins to feel a bit didactic. Still, a very touching film."
