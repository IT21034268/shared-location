3,SALTY Anchovies,"I got these anchovies as a gift for my anchovy-loving boyfriend. While he liked them well enough, they were just too salty to be able to even consider getting through the entire can, even over months. We soaked them in water prior to consumption and that helped, but on the whole I think they would have been more enjoyable with about 1/16th of the salt."
3,"Great plot, not much more","I thought going into the book that it was a series that I would throughly enjoy...not so. From the description I was excited and I couldn't wait to read it. I am not sorry I read it, but after reading it I didn't want to go out and get the rest of the series. There was a little more irony involved than I usually enjoy, so if you like books like The Color of Magic, or The Big Over Easy, it is probably more your style."
4,A great start to a fun series.,"Finally on Kindle! This will be be my forth or fifth time reading this book. Love the story, love the series, and Peirs Anthony is always a fun read."
4,Great story arc and character development,This series is a must read for science fantasy fans. I have personally read it 3 times over the decades and it still holds up. The only reason I knock one star off is Piers' verbose style can get in the way of progressing the story at times. Thankfully this is rare in this book.
5,Great book! Great series! He sure knoes how to keep it real.,"I think that this book and the entire series are excellent novels. Piers Anthony is a fantastic author with many great ideas that he manages to put on paper. If you or I had that skill we'd be rich. I am a sk8er, or for you older folks that's skateboarder, and I don't read or write much at all. This book captivated me and I couldn't put it down. I had to read the entire series after that. it was good enough that I asked my girlfriend to read it. She's enjoying the series and is on the second book. She said that it really makes her think. Well, if you're reading this then you must be at least partially considering getting it so I should stop talking and let you come to your own conclusions."
4,"Morally simplistic, but fun","The moral issues in this book are kind of intentionally simplistic, but it does subtly raise a few theological question, which I might appreciate more if I was religious. The story itself isn't heart-wrenching or anything, but it's just fun to read and see how Piers Anthony develops his world. The book has lots of neat gadgets and such, like Mortis, a very cool car--little touches that make the book entertaining."
4,An easy yet entertaining read,This book effectively combines fantasy with a futuristic view of the world. Science and magic are combined to create an interesting world readers can relate to.
2,A contradiction in terms...,"Piers Anthony has presented an interesting paradox in writing for quite some time. I still find it fascinating that one author can tackle such complex and intense metaphysical and existential issues, and yet remain so utterly simplistic as to almost suggest the whole thing was a 13-year-old's idea. Our protagonist becomes responsible for the balance of souls, discussing numerous facets of afterlife philosophy and religious issues in the process. This is serious stuff we're supposedly dealing with. And yet, Zane at first seems like a middle-school kid with a bunch of new gadgets to play with. Purgatory and Hell are sketched in with minimal detail rather than being explored and described. Women exist either to lust after the men, or fall in love with them like they're in a Disney movie. With some depth and realism this could have become a wonderful epic on a grand scale. As it is, it stands as mindless escapism - not much else."
2,"Imaginative, but it falls flat",Piers Anthony can surely tell a good story with imaginative and original wonders. But by the time the story should wrap-up it gets too labored.Sometimes I think the books from this series were knocked out in a few weeks.
2,Very juvenile; skip this if you're over 13 years old,"Yet another ""man becomes Death"" tale, with a silly subplot about the war of Heaven vs. Hell. Lots of padding in between.I remember in high school several friends had recommended this. Who knows, I might even have liked it... 30 years ago. Reading in retrospect, it seems its target audience is young teenagers who don't have much exposure to ""good"" literature.The plot is shallow--and internally inconsistent/contradictory, the characters are one-dimensional, and the setting was annoying (think ""Xanth on Earth""). The writing style is horridly florid, and you can make a drinking game out of how many exclamation marks are used (warning: you'll get hammered a chapter into it.) As if that wasn't bad enough, there are lengthy dialogue digressions that are probably meant to be ""profound"" but simply come across as superficial and intellectually pretentious.I'm tempted to give it 1 star, but I'll bump up to two as I can actually see young people liking it."
2,don't waste your time,"i was looking forward to reading this series and i really tried with this book but it's just awful. great premise, terrible execution. it's very immature and clearly written by and for someone with a below average IQ. don't waste your time."
4,On a Pale Horse is a Killer,"I thought that On a Pale Horse by Piers Anthony was a very good book. It's about a man named Zane. He shot Death and has to fill the position. It follows him in his new life. I liked it because it dealt with questions that apply to today's living.I also liked it because it shows all the different ways of life. Some of which are: the unknown teen rock band, the extremely rich person who is hated and feared by almost everyone, the person who is terminally ill in the hospital kept alive only by machines.Like most books it starts out a little slow but the further you get into it the more interesting it gets. I think that this book is very good. I think that anyone who is interested in fantasy books would like this book."
3,Enjoyable Book Candy,"This book is one I read years ago in high school and read it again recently. I enjoyed the concept, but as another reviewer mentioned, Piers Anthony may have some excellent books, but his series go down the tubes the further along he goes. I recommend this series, but the Xanth series (which I enjoyed the beginning of) went WAY down the tubes and would not recommend any past the 3rd book."
4,Great debut to a fantastic series,"At 4.5 stars, this is a solid book by Mr. Anthony. I actually enjoyed the Incarnations series more than the few Xanth books I read in the past. I originally read Incarnations book 3 and 5 (5 was the first I ever read, not knowing it was part of a series) so I was a bit 'spoiled' when I decided to buy the entire set. Still, this book was a highly enjoyable read, set in a world where science and magic are mixed together. Zane is a genuinely likable character, and his story is enjoyable.A compassionate Death is a interesting thing to think about, and I enjoyed Zane's attempts to understand his office and mitigate some of the suffering that Death brought. And as with all of Mr. Anthony's books, there's always quirky bits of humor in here along with interesting nuggets of knowledge and philosophy that make for a entertaining and thought-provoking read. I highly recommend not just this book but the whole series."
3,Very enjoyable...but could have been much better,"Let me start off by saying the Xanth novels by Anthony rank as one of my favorite all time fantasy series...truly fun, creative with memorable characters! On A Pale Horse was good, but something about it, especially the dialogue, was a bit off and not up to the high standards I expected. That scene with the band and the preacher and the singer - I couldn't follow any of the dialogue and wasn't sure what era Mr. Anthony was going for. I did love the portrayl of the Devil, loved Death's horse and really enjoyed Death coming into his own by the end of the book. I'll defintely seek out Book 2...but hope the dialogue is a bit tighter.Thx!"
4,A new Death duels with Satan,"On a Pale Horse is set in a somewhat bizarre fantasy world where science competes with magic for getting things done. Our hero becomes Death by shooting and killing the previous Death when the previous Death showed up as his suicide attempt The new Death has to complete his on the job training, solve a mystery and duel with the Devil. Fundamentally a pretty good yarn, however I did not enjoy it as much as a might have because of the fantasy, magic elements. The first in a series..."
5,THIS IS THE BEST BOOK OF THE SERIES!,I would strongly recommend reading this book if you like fantasy or science fiction. Piers Anthony melds these two themes together beautifully. Imagine a world of advanced science and magic all rolled up into one.
5,A must read!!!,I had never read Piers Anthony before this book. I am a definite fan now. I have never read such a wonderful book before! All of the characters are great. I hope Death will be as compassionate when I die. I can't wait to read the rest of the series. Thank you Piers for a great world to explore. I will visit it again and again.
5,"Read this, then read the rest. You wont be disappointed...","Piers Anthony is, in my opinion, one of the most talented authors in the sci-fi/fantasy genre that I have ever read. Simply the idea of the Incarnations of Immortality being run by mortals, and their trials and tribulations of those people make for a wonderful story that one cannot stop reading.I must give you a fair warning though: This book begins a plot that doesnt end for another six books. If you are an avid reader and can't put a book down, I would suggest you don't start reading this...as I could not force myself to stop. I found myself going from store to store buying the rest of the series and reading them all within a 3 month period.If you like this genre, you WILL like this book. I hope everyone else enjoys this book as much as I did."
5,The best book I have ever read! Very thought provoking.,"This book was, what can I say, AWESOME! My friend was reading it and started telling me about it. I thought it sounded interesting so I borrowed it when he was done. Boy was that one of the best choices I have ever made! I'm not a big reader, but I couldn't put this book down. The way Anthony intertwines the world of magic and science and makes the afterlife like a beaurocracy is very interesting. I just ordered the next 2 books and although I almost never read, I plan to read the entire series, possibly more than once. I recommend this book to anyone, especially if you have an open mind and can truly take in the full experience! Read it! If you've read it and would like to talk about it, I'd love to get some email from you."
5,This is the best Fantasy Novel I have read,"Out of all the Fantasy books I have read, On a Pale Horse surpases them by far. The way the book flows from begining to end, never dull or boring, just captivated me."
4,"Relax, read an Incarnation of Immortality book","Delightful, original and definitely a relaxing ride into the philosphies of life (and the after-life). The characters are unique and almost always smoothly introduced. Piers Anthony makes no habit of dilly dallying. He tells a tale and moves along, just the way I like my books. Reading book one has left me wanting more. However, there were times I got the impression that he bunched a chunk of discussion into one sequence. Necessary discussions, most definitely, but it was as if he wrote them in that one place just so he could get them over with. Sometimes I got the urge to skip those few paragraphs, but of course, I knew that if I gave into the temptation, I probably wouldn't understand what comes after it.All in all, I give this book a 4. It was, after all, most enjoyable."
5,Piers At His Best,"This book was my favorite of the series, though i have only read the first 3 and am halfway through the fourth. I love Anthony's take on death and what his job is. Also, Mortis is awesome. As I progressed through the series, i realized that Zane continues to be my favorite character. He is the least likely person to be considered as death yet, he makes the coolest death i have ever read about, even topping Terry Pratchet's Discworld Death. I strongly reccomend this for any anthony fan and if you have never read a piers anthony book, try this one!"
3,Interesting Take on Death,"Several comments have been made by customers stating that this book depicts women in a harsh way, I strongly agree with this. However, if you look past this unfortunate part of the book, you will find a lot of interesting ideas that Piers Anthony has presented in regards to death and the afterlife.I gave it three stars because I didn't exactly love the whole book. The ending became jumbled up and I felt it didn't exactly serve justice to the interesting first half of the book."
5,Amazingly deep and well thought out series..,"Let me say right off.. Piers Anthony is not the most elegant of writers.. His style is rather simplistic (by design I think) and he does not waste time on a lot of fluff.. The plus side of this is that rather than forcing imagery and a particular visualization of a scene on the reader, his style stimulates the imagination to create your own version of his worlds in your mind.On a Pale Horse begins one of the best fantasy/sci-fi series I have read. Despite its age, it is a series I find myself drawn back to over and over again. EVERYTHING CONNECTS in this series.. It has made me reread the books repeatedly, taking new pleasure in the realizations that come.. For example, there are events in this book that happen because of events in the 2nd, 5th and 6th books of the series.. (I don't want to give spoilers)..Creative, unique and richly thought-out.. If you enjoy a good fantasy story, you will not be disappointed."
2,Not too pleased.,"Though the author seems to have some interesting philosophy behind his writing, I was not impressed with the dialogue and setting of the book. The creation of this scientific/magical future was unbelievable to me. The conversations between the characters seemed forced and badly timed. To me, the only time when the story flowed was when the writing led to the internal workings of the characters' minds."
1,Really one of the worst things I've ever read.,"I picked this book up because they say it inspired Dead Like Me the tv programme on Showtime. It was against my better judgement to even finish this book.This starts out interesting enough -- main character Zane kills death, assumes his office and is now the Grim Reaper. Cool idea, definately.But after about 2 or 3 chapters, the story spirals down: the characters are one dimensional; the plot murky, predictable and lame; the dialog is as bad as a cheesy 70's porn film.I wouldn't recommend this book to my worst enemy, I really wish I'd stopped it when it went downhill, because I might have been more forgiving that way."
4,Good,A lot of the matches were pretty good.I like the real fights at streetbrawls.com but this tape was worth it.
5,came fast like brand new,Highly recommended :) I love I am ghost. Cd came like a brand new one you get at the store.
1,Why parts of this album are good,"I listened to some of the songs off this album. Especially in Lady Madeline, I found some of the lyrics good and the rest just emo drivel--and bad emo drivel at that. So I did a search online for some of the lines from Lady M and wouldn't you know, I came upon a website by a poet named Jason Paul Fox. He wrote most of his poetry 15-20 years ago, when many of the members of IAG were very young children at best. I looked through the album to find Mr Fox credited, but his name appears nowhere. So, kiddies, now you know where they came up with such great poetry. Sorry to burst your bubble."
4,Firefly,I enjoy looking at Serenity from different angles and examining details of the ship. Brings back memories of the series and movie in a solid form.
3,What the *$%*?,"When it comes to Birthday presents, my son Horace never fails to find something unusual. Whether it's a novelty toilet brush or a bust of the Fuhrer molded in dark Belgian chocolate (surely Adolf would have favoured white chocolate?) he always comes out with a surprise. This item was what he had to offer last year. To this day I haven't got the slightest idea what it is."
2,Not my favorite interpretation,"Stunning music but not so stunning interpretation. Why? It plods along without spirit or Passion. In a choice between this and going without a recording of St. Matthew's Passion, I'd rather go without."
2,"Dark, depressive and sloooooooooooooow","Klemperer makes Bach sounds like Bruckner or Wagner. Beeing so dark, depressive and dramatic, it's very difficult to listen to the 3 CDs in sequence. This album is not a first choice (I cast my vote on the Gardiner version), neither an essencial recording, but a curiosity: how would Bach compose if he lived in late 19th century?"
4,Great period piece,"Stellar singers, choirs, orchestra and conductor interpreting Bach in a very slow, very grand style--the result is sometimes impressive, but at times just plodding and muddy. The dense polyphony of Bach becomes a swelling sonic mush and the tempos range from magisterial to simply boring. Still--such great soloists and a look back to the heroic Teutonic conducting style of the late 19th/early 20th century is worth listening to and at in its best moments, awe inspiring...."
5,the land of far beyond aka pilgrims progess,Had read this book years ago and the story really stuck in my mind. It is a very easy read with lovely illustrations. The story line has a religious theme that covers many of the faults and virtues of the human race. The story has many likable characters who personify the one particular characteristic. The illustrations are old fashioned but complement the story. Have really enjoyed reading it again.
3,Too Padded to Be Great,"The Children's Blizzard is a harrowing tale, at least the sections that are directly about the terrible blizzard of 1888 that swept over the Dakota-Nebraska prairie. The author, David Laskin, picks some interesting tales of both survival and death and makes the entire terrifying night come alive. The full book, though, contains much more than these sequences and feels overly padded as the tales of immigrants arriving in America blend into discussions of how cold fronts move to the history of the weather service and further into quite gruesome accounts of what actually takes place as the body freezes (despite its graphic nature this particular section proves quite important to the story.) The book pales beside such classics as Isaac's Storm as the pieces do not always move towards creating a compelling narrative. Still when the blizzard finally hits the various tales of teachers, children, and farmers caught out in it are weaved together quite well."
3,A great story poorly told,"The story of the blizzard of '88 is one familiar still today to many residents of the plains states. Laskin tries to build too many life stories with sketchy information, makes factual errors and provides too much tedious meterological detail. He tells what was on the minds of some of the victims of the storm even though they died before they spoke with anyone. He concludes by making moral judgments that are based on tangential information. For example, he claims that the plains should not have been settled so heavily and supports this assumption by the declining population in many areas of the plains. He forgets to mention that one family farmed 160 acres in 1888 and that same family today often farms 2000 acres. Could that have a bearing on the decreased population?"
4,Personal family history,"My grandparents immigrated from Norway to North Dakota, and I spent many summers with them. It's a strange state, weather-wise. I've lived in New England for 30 years and there's just no comparison.I read this book in one day; it totally consumed me, thinking about my grandparents and how they managed to survive in such an in hospitable climate. It also makes me grateful of the sacrifices they made for their children.Parts of this should be required reading in American history."
5,"Well written, interesting, amazing American history","As a teacher I found this book very interesting for many reasons. Besides history, I also learned a lot about the effects of hypothermia and weather forecasting. I found the history of the plains and the people that lived there the most interesting and I could relate to the dilema the teachers and parents faced as the storm descended upon them so quickly. A fascinating American story which taught me a great deal, information I never knew before."
3,Moderately disappointing,"Not that great. A rather typical format: describe the characters, try to add drama and tension by describing the cliched loss of children and immigration to a strange land, jumble about with time and place, do a weak job at describing the science and end with the tragedy and you've got this book. It was pretty formulaic.I was interested in reading this because I wanted to know more about the winter described in Laura Ingalls Wilder's ""The Hard Winter"". I did learn that it was a different year of incredibly bad winter storms, not the particular blizzard described in this book.I was also disappointed in the overall treatment of the individual people's possible emotions, thoughts and actions. There was too much emotional drama added to what might have taken place or what those who froze to death were thinking. It didn't seem real."
2,"Too much science, not enough history.","I am a historian, so when I picked up this book, I thought that it would be more about the history and consequences of the blizzard. Alas, it was more about the science of frostbite and freezing temperatures. The book is certainly well written, it just left me cold. Sorry, pun really NOT intended!"
1,Very Disappointing!,"This book reads like a meteorological textbook. I'm only 24% into the book & am really struggling to stay with it. I feel cheated out the $9.68 I paid for this book. It really should be free. If you're into meteorology, which I am not, you'll like this book. I just hope I can make it to the end. Hopefully, in the future, a better author will write about this particular storm, just tell the story, and leave out all the unneccesary hogwash this author uses to fill the gaps. I will be hesitant to read anything else by this author."
4,fun to read,"But you really better enjoy meteorology. (I do) Lately I've been drawn to books about the plains. My Antonia was especially good. What a tough life. Heck, it's still tough."
4,Interesting Historical Story,"I grew up in Nebraska, and studied the blizzard of 1888 in school. The story is very compelling, and kept my interest. The hardest part of reading the book was keeping all the names and locations straight in my mind. Highly recommend this book for history buffs."
4,Haunting,"Pluses:1. Haunting true story - the ""what might have beens."" I know that these people would be dead of old age by now anyway, but it's still heartbreaking. And then I think about my grandfather, who was a teenager, and lived in the next state over, Wisconsin, at the time. I think that the stories and warnings that came down to us kids probably originated with his hearing of this tragedy.2. The modern meteorological explanation of the blizzard, how and why it began so suddenly. Fascinating science.3. The modern explanation of freezing to death. Fascinating science.Minuses:1. The recounting of the power struggle in the weather service. But that's just me. Other people might find that fascinating too.Bottom line: read this book."
5,Fabulous,This book was amazing. I didn't know anything about the blizzard of 1888. A very good read. I would highly recommend it.
5,"Engrossing, harrowing, incredibly sad","I read this book, (twice, in fact), and it wasextremely interesting, albeit incredibly sad. The author has much information on the formation of what was, essentially, a ""perfect storm"". He also leads the reader through the different stages ofhypothermia, & we get a very candid look at how the body falls to extreme cold and trauma. Highly recommended reading!!!!"
5,A great read,"This little book packs a lot of history into a small space. It reads like a thriller, has fascinating explanations for deadly weather patterns and provides an insight into the terrible trials that faced immigrant farmers in the upper Midwest. The history of these affected families before they emigrated from Europe, and their histories years after the great blizzard are added bonuses."
4,Interesting and Heartbreaking,"What a fascinating story, from the background of the immigrants, to the history of forecasting weather, to the sad stories of the unfortunate victims and their families. Laskin was able to describe vividly the struggles and the heroics that were experienced in the blizzard. The heartbreaking part was losing people to the storm after getting to know them."
2,Didn't finish,I could only read half of this book before I quit. I thought that the characters and how they came to be there was interesting but there were too many pages on meteorolgy and its history. I was more interested in the families and their plight. I am diapointed because I really wanted to like this book. I had hopes that it would be a good read for me since it was rated so highly.
5,Grandfather's role in blizzard,"Book was in excellent condition; contains alot about early weather forcasting; weather conditions leading up to the terrible snowstorm that took so many children's lives. No time for warnings. My interest was because my grandfather help keep the children at his school house during the storm, which undoubtedly save their lives. I'm still reading and looking at family histories in the area where I grew up. A real part of history."
4,Overall a good book,"I almost didn't make it through the beginning of this book because it seemed to drag on. Somewhere along the way my interest was peaked again, but soon faded when Laskin went on about the weather service and all the boring details that most folks don'tunderstand or care about.Finally he got to the main reason I wanted to read this book, the blizzard. It's a very good story but I could of done without many of the boring details he filled it with.Do like I did and get it at the library."
2,The Childrens Blizzard,I would like to retract my previous preview and thank the author of this book David Laskins. He has had email contact with me. He was grateful and thankful for my information. My great grandmother Addie was mentioned in this story. She was wearing thin shoes and held a small child on her lap all night in a hay stack during this horrible storm. Due to these unfortunate events she lost her right leg below her knee and some of her toes on her left foot. She was 14 years old when this happened. Mr. Laskins willingness to listen to my families account show us he strives for accuracy. Thank you Angie Robin
5,AN AWESOME BOOK AND AN AWESOME BAND,"Def Leppard is by far one of the greatest bands in rock 'n' roll history. This book depicts their ""road to fame"" and does so very nicely. If you don't have this book already, I suggest you go and buy it NOW."
3,Good,Came in time for my class. Helped out so much! I dont think I would have passed if the book didnt come when it did. UNFORTUNATELY there were pages where pictures were cut out.
3,Hollywood System Polishes Flawed Film,"The large cast in this is wonderful, from Cary Grant to virtually every contract player who has a line; the production values as well. It would be impossible to cast a film like this with that kind of wall to wall talent now; its a small monument to the lost studio system. The problem is that with an intriguing premise and Cary Grant going for it, the film falls short in comparison to what Preston Sturges could have done with it in one direction or Frank Capra in another. It straddles being a children's tale or an adult's tale with a child at its center, probably for calculated economic reasons. It almost moves you, it almost becomes a giddy satire, it almost makes you believe the story, but just stops short. The ending is just right. And watching Cary Grant dance through the theatrical role makes you dream about what he could have done with ""Twentieth Century"". With a Sturges rewrite polish, this could have been...but it isn't."
4,RZM is reissuing at the end of August 2009,"I haven't read the book because it's quite expensive. However, according to RZM's website, the book will be available again at the end of August 2009 for $69.95."
3,Good historical analysis,"Hell's Gate is a very good, in depth analysis of one of the Eastern front's most important battles. The buyer should be aware however that this book, in my opinion, is meant for military historians, not for the casual reader. As indicated in previous reviews, the book would benefit from better maps and detailed illustrations supporting the troop movements and positions well described in the book. My other criticism is that the author approaches the subject very analytically, and while he has incorporated first person material he has missed an opportunity to make the subject matter much more exciting and a better read. All in all it is a very good, detailed account of military history and if you are a serious student of WWII & the Eastern Front you would benefit by purchasing this product."
5,POWERFUL! you will want to read it over and over,"Nash does one of the best historical accounts of a massive and complicated battle that I have yet read,The extra time spent on the personalities involved and their relationships adds tremendously to the value of this book. Winning the battles but losing precious equipment and ground was a big part of the German retreat, Sadly the loss of life here is also extreme and the personal stories that delve into that loss are painful and foretell of worse to come.Filled with rare fantastic photos and first person accounts this is the definitive book on Korsun/Cherkassy. I hope that while survivors of battles like these are still living Nash will continue to create works like this that add so much to history and our understanding of WWII."
4,Nash's Work Well Worth the Money,"Mr. Nash presents The Korsun battle in an intelligent and refreshing style. Using a well balanced combination of context, operational overview, and first-person detail, the book provides the reader an enjoyable and informative account of this little known action. Both photos and text concentrate primarily on the German point of view, although this does not seem to detract from the overall utility of the work. The selection of photos includes many that I have not seen before, and are well captioned. Especially impressive was Mr. Nash's sometimes keen analysis of various events or situations - however, one wishes he would have included more such sections. I recommend this work for all interested in the Eastern Front, and consider it well worth the price. Bottom line: If you don't recieve it for Christmas, go out and buy it on your own."
5,All the benefits of a modular without the old school modular looks,To say that I'm pleased with this helmet is an understatement. I ordered the Matte Black helmet and a silver mirror shield and they look great together. The helmet is very comfortable and much quieter than the old Shoei RF 900 that I retired. I'm looking forward to several years of use.
4,The purest interpretation of Beethoven's piano sonatas ...,"Unlike many more famous interpreters such as Emil Gilels, Alfred Brendel, Rudolf Serkin ..., Yves Nat plays so naturally that the sound could even appear rough ... It is also to be said that the recordings were made in the fifties and it greatly contributes to the authenticity of the sound ...You should definitely listen to these discs if You happen to be a Beethoven fan : in fact, You might remain amazed while listening to the latest sonatas, especially the last one, as Nat plays them much faster than any other as far as I know ...It gives an impression of lightness and simplicity even if these pieces are far from being easy and I think that this interpreter deserves the title of most natural interpreter of Beethoven's piano sonatas !"
5,Beethoven: Les Sonates pour piano,Beethoven: Les Sonates pour piano is a recording with Yves Nat playing Beethoven's Sonatas and was recorded in the 1950's and what Glenn Gould did for Bach Yves Nat does for Beethoven. Yves Nat plays with vigour and with a masculine touch which is right for Beethoven's emotion driven music. The booklet contains well-written liner notes by André Tubeuf and translated into English by Brian Prescott. The sound quality is surprisingly good to be well over 50 years old and EMI has done a splendid job with this. Highly recommended. 5/5.
5,"Impulsive, very personal and fascinating","This is a very particular interpretation of Beethoven. It's passionate, impulsive and engaging. It's not analytical where every note has been thought ofseparately. If I had to compare Nat to a sculptor the name Rodin would come to mind.I dont think there is a ""best"" interpretation of the Beethoven sonatas, but this is one of the finest, however I dont think it should be the only version you should listen to.Nobody else played the sonatas like Nat did.This is surely a good reason to go and listen to these recordings."
5,An Absolutely Must Buy-THE BEST EVER,"I need to get this review down quickly, so I will just say that if you listen to the Op.109 (number 30) and don't think this is the greatest performance of any Beethoven Sonata ever recorded, well, what can I say. Not that Nat is a slouch in most of the other works. In fact, I would take his late sonatas, with the possible exception of No. 27, which I award to Solomon, over anyone else. Sure, here and there in the full repertoire he misses a little. But he is always so damn musical, and so in touch, I feel, with the spirit of Beethoven, that this set HAS to be the first choice in the sonatas. More analysis at a later date. But each time I listen I enjoy and appreciate not just Nat, but Beethoven even more. After 44 years of listening to these works by countless artists, I think that says something about the greatness of Nat."
5,An excellent book on dark-ages Europe,"This book covers the various barbarian invaders of Europe, beginning with the Huns and Germans in the Fourth century and continuing through to the Mongols. The book is written in an easy to read manner, and the excellent pictures in this book are crowned by 16 full-page pictures by the incomparable Angus McBride."
2,Not as I imagined,"I've purchased the hardbound editions of 7 books by Tim Newark since January 2011. This is the first time I've bought a paperback edition and I am disappointed. The book is readable, but I didn't expect so many creases on the cover. I might just buy the hardback edition for the same price and donate this to a public library. All-in-all, I would consider this book ""Acceptable"" instead of ""Good""."
5,Of Course it's Not Up to Me,"'ten readings of a warning' by All Smiles (Jim Fairchild) on dangerbird records is a beautiful album & I hope anyone & everyone reading this entry will check it out & invest in this real piece of quality.It's the full package...the album artwork is great & in an understated environmentaly friendly way & all Jim's eloquent lyrics are included ,which,for any fan,is always a real bonus & the liner notes make for interesting reading too.Jim's diverse musical talent shines here & his voice has a gentle & fragile empathy that leads you through an emotional journey,sometimes tinged with sadness,often singed with humour,& as this filters through,it really is all smiles"
5,Narnia Code dvd,"Excellent production and exploration of CSLewis's mind set and knowledge and points to deeper and greater understand of the Narnia Series. Much easier to follow and grasp than reading the book, The Narnia Code, although that appeals to academically and scientifically minded persons. If you like CSLewis at all, you must add this to your collection."
5,Narnia,This is very exciting. I would have never made this connection. I have read the books to my daughter. I never realized not once the connection between the books and the planet. I will be watching this documentary with her this Saturday. I can't wait to see the expression in her face...
2,A MUST READ REVIEW,"Mr. Klass is a popular forerunner of the skeptics in our society regarding the ""u.f.o. phenomenon."" In this book, he attepts to express his understanding that human percerption is inherently biased and, therefore, cannot be relied upon for accurate data (with respect to the ufo ""abductions""). I think that if you are really interested in the validity of abductees, a thorough understanding of sensation and perception psychology is a necessity. Then, you would be better educated to decide whether there is any credibility to these ""abductions."" Mr. Klass makes interesting points in this book which are worthy of your time; however, dismissing testimony of an alleged abductee because she was not attractive does raise serious doubts as to Mr. Klass' priorities and scientific methods. I say, buy a book on psychology instead."
1,Debunking At It's Finest,"If you are interested in exploring the truth, you won't find it reading this book! Phil Klass is a government implant whose sole purpose is to debunk any and all facets of UFOLOGY, including The Abduction Phenomenon. Convinced that everything has a ""prosaic"" explanation, Klass deliberately and dutifly avoids those cases which remain unexplained or for that matter dismiss with any credulity what ""alien abduction"" may be, if in fact it is not happening. Don't waste your time!"
3,Great for beginners maybe?,I thought this would have more fun stuff to try vs just going over the basics. Not super excited once I started going through it.
2,Lame not for experienced or married couples,"I bought this with low expectations based on the reviews thinking it would be fun and maybe a little informative, but it was truly disappointing. It's written in a voice like a middleschooler - embarrassed or mushy weird. we did laugh a lot, but mostly at how oddly it was written (""try this kiss on your hand"" what the h...), which didn't really encourage a romantic atmosphere. more than half the book is spent on weird buildup to overly detailed instructions (""get close to your partner"" duh?). it was really a waste because even the kisses that i'd never heard of before (which you can easily find on the internet) are unheard of because they're lame (electric kiss = rubbing your hair with a wool blanket and shocking your partner) or something that happens naturally in a normal physical relationship (""rub her arms"" ""rub your noses together""). skip this one unless you're a exnun reentering society."
5,Great learning tool!!!,"If you do not know where to start with kissing a woman, read this book! It will give you several great techniques to equip you with the tools thatwill turn her on!!!"
2,"The Art of Kissing, 2nd Revised Edition","The book was bought as a gag gift for a friend who just turned 21 and has never been kissed. I had a chance to read through the book and found it not to be what I was wanting, but for her it would do. I thought it was supposed to be about the art of kissing. I am still on a mission to find a book that is completely about ways to kiss. Now don't get me wrong this book has some tips on kissing, but this only accounts for a very small partial amount of the book."
1,This book is not for adults.,"This book is not for anyone who is over 15. If you've kissed anyone you're too advanced for this book and if you're over 15, hopefully, you're too mature."
1,"wet and sloppy, and left a bad taste in my mouth","I should start by establishing that I am not an expert kisser, I have only kissed one person, and it was so long ago that I cannot recall whether they liked it. I read this book because I was actually unaware of the actual mechanics of a kiss in regard to pressure and suction.Giving my inexperience, I feel I should have been able to get some new information from this book, but I was unable to learn anything from it, with the exception of the electric kiss. I was dissapointed because it seemed like the kisses were ordinary, common sense, and simple, the kinds you have seen in movies a million times, and descibed with a level of ambiguity that gives me the impression the author has not tired some of these kisses himself. The author also seems rather prudish (even by my standards) when he questions wether one should kiss on the first date.All in all this was a very dissapointing book."
2,What a let down of an anticipated film,This film is basically a gore film about a fictional Japanese military unit called the Unit 731. It could have been better but they cant all be great. The film Men Behind The Sun is a much better film about the same story. Try it instead.
3,2 out of 3 ain't bad,"Two out of the 3 inks sent were fine, one wouldn't print cyan. I am in the process of getting a replacement (pretty trouble-free, i just emailed and they asked if i wanted a credit or replacement. replacement is in the mail). i didn't like having to open all 3 to see if they worked. now i am not sure if the open ones will last until i need them, so we'll see..."
1,Bummer of a Book,"It is surprising how bad this book really is. I have to echo what others have said here. I thought, ""Oh, come on, can't be as bad as they said."" It's worse!Pathetic to think a publishing company that is supposed to be Lutheran would put out something this poor. But, as I look at other things that Augsburg-Fortress offers, it is not surprising. They are so into politically correct left-wing theology it is not really a mystery why they would give a book on Luther such short schrift.Bad layout, design, printing, formatting and writing.A real bummer of a book."
1,What a lame book,"Slapped together, obviously. Hard to read the print is so small and crammed together. Some egg-head approach to Luther. Don't bother."
4,A warning for all those interested in Soviet Intelligence.,"This is not meant to be a review, but rather a warning for all those interested in Russian intelligence.This book, and Suvorov's other book ""Inside the Aquarium: The making of a Top Soviet Spy"" and one in the same. So only purchase one."
4,I have many reasons to believe this is not a fiction.,"Really, to me it is not. After living in the Soviet Union for ... all my life, I can say that what Suvorov writes is too much realistic and pretty easy to believe. I had seen and heared enough of that from real-life tellers before I red Suvorov's books. It is not that I want to add another mistral to the spirit of the cold war. It is a challenge if other nations know who really rules their lives. Suvorov's ""Aquarium"" gives this sick thought a very good try."
3,Intersting insight in comunist rusia,"`Aquarium' by vladimir bogdanovich wich gives an interesting account of the military career of Vladimir Bogdanovich Rezun(born April 20, 1947), better known by the pen name Viktor Suvorov. He is a Russian writer and historian. He served in the Soviet Army and worked in Soviet military intelligence (GRU). He deserted and escaped to the United Kingdom in 1978 where he worked as an intelligence analyst and lecturer. He made his name writing books about Russian History, the Soviet Army, GRU, and Spetsnaz"
2,DOESN'T ANYONE PROOFREAD?,"I DON'T NORMALLY REVIEW THE BOOKS I READ, BUT THIS ONE REALLY ANNOYED ME. IT IS APPARENT TO ME THAT NO ONE PROOFREAD OR EDITED THIS KINDLE SELECTION. THE NUMBER OF MISSPELLINGS, TYPOS, INCOMPLETE SENTENCES, INCORRECT PUNCTUATION, ETC. WAS MIND BLOWING."
5,One of the best true crime books I've read,"As a lover of the genre, I have read many true crime books, and this is definitely one of the best. Fascinating portrayal of the man and the case. I've read it several times! Highly recommended."
5,Excellent book,"There were some interesting facts in here that were not commonly known to the public. It's a sad sad story, but interesting as far as how the human mind can work. I liked learning what was going on behind the scenes."
2,"Detailed, but flawed with errors","I read this book cover to cover. I had found errors even in the first few chapters. Those errors were confusing, such as the age of McKenzie in Scott's affair with Janet. Later, on page 120, the policemen started interviewing Shawn Sibley (Amber's friend) at 11:02. Then on page 124, according to the book, one of the poliecemen switched off the tape recorder at 12:41 PM. Both policemen stretched their legs before continuing their session with Amber Frey. On page 125, one of the policemen said that he was about to start interviewing again at 11:50 AM. HOW WAS THIS POSSIBLE?There are many errors like these, so they made me doubt the credibility of the author and the book. If this is the best book on the case, then I'd better not read any other books about this case at all."
3,Disappointing to say the least . . .,I was very disappointed in this book -- unfortunately I paid the full $30 for it while on vacation -- and have regretted it ever since. There was really not much new in it that we did not already know from Court TV's reporting during the trial. I too found many typographical errors and errors in timelines that would have been caught with a careful reading by a good (or even fair) editor/proofreader. I also didn't feel that the photographic evidence and photos were very well outlined. Many of them had vague statements under them and were never really referred to in the book. I put it down feeling disappointed as I had expected more information and explanation.
3,Interesting if you can't get enough of the Peterson case,"There is not a lot that is new in this book, but it makes an interesting chronicle for anyone who can't get enough of the Peterson case. I do wish that the writer (isn't she a lawyer?) would stick to the evidence and keep her personal opinions out of her writing, however. As a former debater myself, I was a little disturbed (and a lot annoyed) by the writer's opining as she labelled Scott a sociopath. Or, is the writer also a psychiatrist? Still, the book is an interesting over-view of the case and the investigation leading up to the conviction."
5,A legal look at little reported facts of the case,"Let me admit upfront that I have a love hate view of the whole Scott Peterson soap opera, since I live in northern California and it was on the front page of the major dailies for two years ad nasuem. Having said that, the one thing this book has going for it, that makes it even worth a read, is the legal nook and cranny approach the author took to present little known or never made known facts of the case.To bad most cases do not make the news either because the victims are poor, not pretty, middle class/wealthy, or have the media machine behind them to keep them in the news."
4,Revealing,"When the case finally ended anD death row was his faTe, a little voice kept haunting me, ""what if he didn't do it..he is going to die."" After reAding Ms Crier's book there is no doubt in my mind at all. He did kill Laci - HE PLANNED IT OUT, HE KILLED HER 2 DAYS AFTER THEY FOUND THEY WERE HAVING A BABY BOY...I can't believe anyone could do such a terrible thing, and the only apparent reason was he decided he didn't want a wife and a baby-like Mrs. Rocha said'""divorce was always an option..""Not for Scott Peterson."
4,Very good book.,"This book was really good. It was very well written and an easy read. What I enjoyed most about the book was we got a real good insight on what kind of person Laci was, as well as all the people involved. The media has ""told"" us who she was, but this book brings it to a new level. At points, I got goose bumps reading some of the details after finding Laci's body. All in all it was a really good book. The only thing that I disliked about this book was there was a little too much dialog, which could of been left out, imo. I read Ann Byrd's book, as well as Amber's and both seemed just thrown together for mere profit. Catherine Crier's book was not thrown together. It was highly researched, and gives us info the ""average"" person who have followed this case on a regular basis, would not know."
4,Another great insight,"Just as Ann Birds book showed great insight to the family dynamics, Catherine Criers book shows a terrific insight to the investigation. I also noticed a few errors.. as I guessed this was rushed to publication while the interest in this case is still hot. But over all a great read.... (I will NOT buy Amber Freys book, as I don't feel the need to gain insight to a few dates or her pictures of herself)"
5,A Deadly Game The Untold Story of theScott Peterson Investi,"This was a fascinating book on the Peterson case.It was so engrossing and certainly one that was needed to shed truth on this case. The factual narrative was credible and for me, it clarified so much of the drama we had followed during those years from its onset to Scott's sentencing. The one pressing question all this time was why Laci put up with this man's lies and infidelities. Within the book I got a glimse of this beautiful mother-to-be who had been so horribly wronged by her pathological lying husband. As a crime-drama and mystery genre reader, it became my favorite."
3,Really??,"I was SO excited to read this book before it was even released. Once it was available for purchase, I snapped it up and began reading but was so thrown off by the terrible editing of the book that I was actually distracted the entire way through! I kept wondering, ""Were they so desperate to get this book out FAST that they couldn't take the extra time to have it properly edited?"" Never have I had an experience like this before when reading a book! Most of the content (when I was able to focus) was good, but I hope that Catherine Crier finds another editor for any future books."
4,Very Informative,"I followed the Peterson case on Court TV daily. At first I thought that Peterson was not guilty and had been framed by the Medesto Police Department and that they did very sloppy work. After reading the book, I found out that the Police did very good work that was never told in court. I was a little disapointed that the book came out before the sentencing phase. I was also disapointed that they did not prosecute Peterson's mother, whom after reading the book, was definitely a co-conspiritor. Now I can not wait to read the book by Peterson's step sister."
5,Couldn't put it down!,"This book is very well written. Catherine Crier brings all of the details together, from the evidence gathered (much of which I previously knew nothing about) to the emotions and psychological impact on the many living victims Scott left in his wake. A Deadly Game is an objective and factual analysis of the investigation from beginning to end, yet kept my interest moreso than any work of fiction I've read."
3,Very Bias,"I read the book hoping there would at least an un-biased report. I was disappointed. Just like the rest of the books, it has nothing new to offer. I personally do not feel that the D.A. proved their case and the ""guilty"" verdict, if by following the law, never should have been handed down. I say ""heaven help us all"" if this is what our judicial system has come to."
4,A Good Overview of the Laci Peterson Case,"Crier's book is, so far, the best to be written on the subject. Even avid followers of the trial and readers of the transcripts will find much of interest in this book which has not previous come to light. To her credit, Crier also provides a realistic look at all of the main characters in the case.My criticism is that some passages are slightly confused (e.g., present from Scott to Laci with no follow up as to contents), and some things are surprisingly omitted (e.g., allegations of a fight Laci had with another girl in high school). Perhaps it is simply a matter of careless editing and a rush to press. As to the latter, perhaps Crier delved into the allegations and found them to be baseless. She does not deal at all with the surveillance cameras across the street from the Peterson house or possible grand jury proceedings which were obliquely referred to in the course of the case."
4,Great read... where's the editor?,"I couldn't put this book down, and at times my mouth was literally hanging open in shock. But please, this is some of the worst editing I've ever seen and it made it hard to stay focused on the text. A real let down in that sense."
4,Grabbed me from the first page!,"I thought I was tired of the whole Scott Peterson hype. I had passed on all the other books. But I picked up this book and skimmed the first few pages and I was hooked. It is compelling in that you get a lot of information that never came out before including transcripts of phone conversations. It is a bit repetitious in spots but never boring. Once you read all the evidence, the case against Scott Peterson is irrefutable. True crime fans and courtroom drama junkies must read this one."
4,Good Reading,"I purchased this book for myself, really enjoyed the work. My wife read it later and she also liked it."
3,Nothing new,"Through out the book their are many mentions of ""what they didn't say in court...evidence that could not be shown in court..."" None of which convinced me of Scott's guilt. Don't get me wrong...I know he DID it, but this book offered no new evidence."
1,still believe the jury got it wrong,"I do believe Catherine Crier got it right: the investigation and trial was a deadly game, but it was perpetuated by Detective Brocchini, the night Laci was missing, not Scott Peterson. The newer book, Presumed Guilty, reveals this telling fact, that Scott was threatened that night with being guilty. Is this responsible investigating? Of course not. Would this have affected Scott's behavior? Of course. I think Catherine Crier would end up with a very different analysis if she had some of the actual evidence from Tales form the Morgue, and the newer book, Presumed Guilty. Evidence, is ultimately what any human being should have their sentence based on. I think all who have followed this case would want the same for themselves. I believe Scott was betrayed in a multitude of ways, which will be resolved in the next trial he deserves to get."
1,Oh Please,"The Queen of NE brings her completely slanted view to the Scott Peterson case. What is really courious is how she managed to get 40,000 pages of discovery when at the same time the defense only had 27,000 pages.And of course, being in a major player in Crimeratainment she is fee to imbellish and suppose (much like the prosection did) to tell a simple tale of murder.Except it's a tale of BEHAVIOR. Nothing new here folks, move along. Some actual proof anyone committed a crime would be a much better read."
5,This is a great book,"I have just started to read this book. It has been, so far, a great book. It goes into more detail than the news media ever did. That is what makes it so good. I think Catherine Crier did an excellent job in writing this book. I recommend it."
3,A Deadly Game,"The story was interesting and well written, however there were many typos in the kindle edition. I found the timeline of the story easier to follow than most crime stories."
3,Would Be Better Without Typos,"This is a very good book, but almost every page I read has a typo on it. It makes it very hard to, at times, understand because the typos throw you for a loop. I think I paid $6.99 or $7.99 (not sure), but if I'm going to pay for a book that's been published, I don't want there to be any typos when I read it.Thank you."
5,Great book from Judge Crier!,"Easy to read and a solid piece of journalism by Judge Crier. This book takes you through the 'Scott' we never saw or heard from with so much detail and wisdom.This book is one you won't want to put down, as Judge Crier takes you through Scott's life, highlighting what we missed (and the jury missed) during the trial. Details, so many details that fill in the empty spaces.Picking up on so much that has been so easy to miss in this case, Judge Crier brings to light the personality of not only this cold-blooded killer, she also brilliantly highlights for her readers the psychology of the Peterson family as well as Laci...Great book from beginning to end."
3,WHY NOT WAIT FOR THE FORMAL SENTENCING???,"""As this goes to press, Scott Peterson remains ensconced in the Stanislaus County Jail, awaiting his formal sentencing by Judge Delucchi on March 11, 2005.""I have always had a problem with authors who releases a book without waiting for the final outcome! Why not just wait a few more months in order to complete the book...Sentencing and all.Despite how well the book may have been written, I loose respect for tbe author. I mean, can they wait a few more months to make their money??Otherwise, this was a well written and thorough book."
3,Save Your Money,"This book is not worth reading unless you've been in a news blackout for several years. It is a thorough account of the crime, but there are excessive extraneous details, and very little new information. The typos are extensive."
4,Worth reading,"The author does a good job of covering all the bases of this case. I would definitely say it is worth your time to read if you are interested in the Laci Peterson disappearance. While most of the book is very compelling, there are some parts that clearly remind you that she is a former lawyer (think wordy and boring). The upside of this is that she can give insight that someone not in the legal profession would lack so it is worth plodding through the slow parts."
3,Not Bad,Catherine did a pretty good job with this book but there were some glaring errors. I found it a good read if you can get past the mistakes. I think she rushed to publish it and needed someone to proofread.
5,He DID it,"Either Scott Peterson is a text-book sociopath who murdered his wife when she had the audicity to get pregnant, or he's the unluckiest man in the world. I believe he's guilty. If only he hadn't told so many lies, if only he'd have kept his pants on, if only he didn't think the grass was greener on the other side of the bay, if only, if only, if only, Laci Peterson may still be alive."
4,indie flick done well,"this indie film maker ""Matt Spease"" has come a long way. i started working with his company back in 2003 and i produce the soundtrack music for his films and from the first film ""duel of the assassins"" all the way to the new one ""Indestructible"" each production just keeps getting better and better. indie film making isn't easy especially with low to no budget, but Matt really uses every bit of his resources to the hilt, check out this new film and all the rest. Paul Zlotucha @ Kobal Records"
5,Strikingly Zenith,"I recommend this Zenith DVD player. It may not be the best player, but for the price and the features it provides, it's worth your blood, sweat, and tears. I've had this DVD player for three years (Christmas 2003) and I haven't had a problem so far. Those people who had a bad experience with this DVD player should be kept away from electronics definitely. Either they're impatient, careless, abusive, or overall just plain idiots."
5,COOL DVD zenith player :),cool DVD PLAYER awsome to the max i likehow i am able to zoom in on the daytime invisible stealth area 51 ideas on the vanish car ideas that the put in jets and tringle kind with no sound extc i zoom up on the walls and see coolphotos that isnt easy to see in normal movie mode i realy like the remote too its understandable :) so far i bought dvds of dienother day 007 james bond movie and the billbixbie CBS INCREDIBLE HULK DVD and spi kids 3D extc and played music CDS like NIEL DIMOND AND THE eagles CD its realy cool :)IN Christ always Bill PAGE magicianhttp://www.goodnewsbaptist.orghttp://www.pray-give-go.com
4,Solid DVD Player,"I bought this player after having a bad experience with the similarly priced JVC XV-N40BK player. The JVC had audio and visual problems so I returned it. So far the Zenith player has worked out perfectly. I'm using it with an RF modulator and I've had no problems whatsoever. The sound and picture are fine. I've watched Disney and other store-bought DVDs and I'm satisfied with the performance. I haven't tried burned DVDs yet so I wasn't comfortable giving it 5 stars. But for $70, I'm perfectly happy with this player."
2,Could have been good...,"This DVD player has real problems synching audio and video. We have to restart every DVD we play due to the problems with audio synching. It's like watching a bad Godzilla movie!Another problem with it is that the remote is very confusing. It's difficult to start a scene over, it frequently goes to the beginning of the DVD. All in all, we wouldn't buy this player again."
5,why not love it?,"i love this dvd player! it's the best. I can run it all night and still keeps working. plus it's slim. what more can you ask for? space saving, sleek design, and strong! the best for it's money."
4,A great way to remember Audie Murphy,"I live in Melbourne, Australia.It is impossible to find anything on Audie Murphy in this country. When I saw this book advertised I just had to have a copy. I think it has been well presented with a very obvious show of respect for a man who deserves our respect. There are little snippets of background stories which are good, but I would have loved to have read more about Audie the person behind the scenes. The positive and the not-so-positive. It is through these stories and memories that we can get to know him. Nevertheless, the book has a special place in my library, and recently they have been showing a few more of his movies on pay T.V. I simply pull out the book and read the reviews. Thank you Sue Gossett. I am not disappointed."
3,Praise only!,"Sue Gossett tells very detailed about each and every one of the Murphy movies and that's fine, but the book is merely a praise of Audie Murphy and not a journalistic effort. Don't expect to find any criticism of any of the films here - and they were certainly not all good movies! Anyway, if you want to know about the plots, dates of shooting and so on in cronological order, then the book is OK. If you want a more realistic description of the movies, look for ""The Last of the Cowboy Heroes""."
5,Delivered in good conditions,"Sue Gossett is a true admirer of Audie Murphy, one of the greatest soldiers in American History, who became one of the most underrated actors in the history of Hollywood. She describes each film with a pinch of humor."
3,better to know,"The first tape was great, but the second part had a loud static sound that I couldn't hear the actor's voices. It would have been better if I had been told, and the prize had been less for the VHS."
4,Blue Book Answers all,"As a graphic designer this was a great resource for stationery answers. People ask me all the time what the ""right way"" is to do things and having a little history on the various formats is really helpful."
4,Exciting Story,I loved the way Miss Nelson writes. The story is paced well enough so the reader never quite loses interest in the slower places. Very intriguing idea and well done. Would reccomend for anyone who likes dragons.
1,Poor Quality,"It is a cheap material that is for sure and it is standard design, good color though. We should keep in mind you will get what you will pay for."
3,needs more shine,well made tie good looking but not as bright as what on line photo implies. Lacks that silk like shine. overall good tie at good price
2,Potentially dangerous,Build seems very good. I opened up the unit to hook up the wires. I saw the brightly painted red terminal and figure that it was positive. Hooked up the red wire to the red painted terminal and black wire to the other terminal. Plug in my $1500 fish finder and nothing. After some testing the red painted terminal is GROUND! Switched the wires around and now everything works. Thank goodness the $1500 investment didn't get fried because someone painted the wrong terminal!
2,Only Average quality,"To be a truly ""marine grade"" plug the components should be made of stainless steel. I'm still waiting for a manufacturer to do this. Yes the little rubber seal is a nice feature, but not enough to protect the metal parts from corrosion when the plug is not in the receptacle."
3,What can I say?,"This dvd is way to short and that is one of the reason I rated it 3 stars. This dvd is only sixty minutes long and it has a basic plot line. This dvd looks as if it could be a good starting episode for a good series. Also, this dvd is only sub so if you like dub only probably you might want to stay away from this. If you like to see robots fighting then you would probably like this.The animation is beautiful but it doesn't have any extra content except for looking at character stils. All in all it is an alright anime, but I would suggest renting it if you can. If there were more episodes, I might suggest to watch the series."
5,"Mary,RN","I work as an RN and my hands are in water all day. We use alcohol based hand gels too. In the winter my hands were a mess--cracked, dry, painful. I bought this cream and everything changed. It's the best for protecting hands from the cracking, dry effects of the excessive handwashing that nurses do every day. If I get a small crack at the nail it will heal it faster. I will never go through a New Hampshire winter without this cream. It's not stickey and lasts through many handwashings. A necessity for all working hands."
3,"Begins well, but the resolution is contrived and disturbing","I waited eagerly for Mapson's sequel, and initially found it to be as engaging as Hank and Chloe. However, in the last pages, I became disenchanted. The conclusion felt forced and implausible, as if Mapson's publisher had threatened her into completing the book before she was ready. I felt betrayed by Chloe and her inability to make a choice, and the fact that Mapson does not lay out any consequences for Chloe's actions. Also, the inconsistency in Chloe's character -- first, strong and decisive, then weak and imprisoned by conflicting emotion -- bothered me."
4,"doesn't match its prequel, but good","Mapson seems incapable of creating an unsympathetic (though flawed) character, but this book just did not live up to her first ""Hank and Chloe."" I was disappointed that Chloe was not forced to choose between her two loves (as she surely would in real life), and disappointed at the epilogue, in which Chloe's daughter wraps things up in a manner that seemed too pat. However, the relationship between Hank and his young Native American students was touching, although I did wish Hank's parents had been more complexly drawn."
1,Should have been a Muppet!,"Convicted criminal and drug addict Jimi Hendrix was nothing more than a guitar player on speed. He could not perform unless he was stoned to the gills. A piece of trash, a waste of time, a corpse; he's dead, let's move on!"
3,Experience Hendrix,The first 7 songs are the best. The last 13 are a waste on this album. Better too buy the songs on download because this album is not worth the price.
5,Whole Hendrix,"An excellent Hendrix compilation. All of the famous stuff still played on the radio is on here, as well as lesser-knowns. Definitely get this if a Hendrix fan. 20 tracks, over an hour of music. Great value."
4,How dare they not include Voodoo Chile???,"These songs are all terrific, I must say, but condensing The Jimi Hendrix Experience's body of work into one CD is not an easy thing to do. Many of the Hendrix 'must-haves' are here from Purple Haze to All Along The Watchtower. But I regret to see that Voodoo Chile, the 15-minute blues masterpiece, has been left out. Voodoo Chile is one of Hendrix's very best studio cuts, even better than the more well-known Voodoo Child (Slight Return). Still if you want just a taste of Hendrix, this CD would be ideal. But once you have a taste, you'll want a full meal."
5,GREAT CD - GET IT NOW YOU FOOL !,"Every song is awesome!!! It is worth considering that this CD was brought out by the Hendrix family. When it was compiled, they remastered the music to how it originally sounded on the record - exactly how jimmy wanted it to sound. Almost all CDs not brought out by the family were wrongly mixed....I know this for a fact because i read it in my guitar magazine and everything in guitar mags is true! So get this CD and hear the true awesome music of legend guitar player Jimmy Hendrix."
5,I love you Jimi!,"I never get sick of listening to this cd, and that should tell you something. ""All Along the Watchtower"" and ""Crosstown Traffic"" are my personal favorites. Everyone should be forced to listen to Hendrix at least once in their lifetime."
3,good,"Good collection of Jimi's big radio hits and well-known songs plus a few choice album cuts and later stuff you couldn't get on the 'The Ultimate Experience,' the previous hits comp. This is really scratching the surface of what Jimi recorded in his lifetime; many more gems didn't make it onto this generous CD -for those who can't be satisfied with just one Hendrix album. But here is some GREAT music."
5,The ultimate experienced CD right here!,"As a single-disc compilation, Experience Hendrix: The Best Of is an easy not so hard to beat thing. Drawing from all the original digitally remastered reissue MCA albums. This 20-track collection contain his hits of all the major highpoints in Hendrix's career songs like ""Purple Haze"", ""Foxey Lady"", ""All Along The Watchtower"", ""Little Wing"", ""Red House"", ""The Wind Cries Mary"", ""Manic Depression"" a live version from Woodstock of ""Star Spangled Banner"" and ""Angel"". It gives an accurate impression of why Jimi Hendrix was so revolutionary and influential in rock music history itself. All of his completed studio recordings are mandatory listening. As it is for a terrific guide introduction to this legendary guitarists own groundbreaking work!"
2,Look elsewhere,"The selection is weighted towards his earlier Jimi Hendrix Experience pieces and when possible, shorter versions of the songs are given. There is a good sampling of those here, but the sound quality is overall very flat. This is not an especially well remastered recording and if you want to get a sense of how broad and complex a sound this musician was capable of producing you might well look elsewhere. If you just want something to download onto your IPod, this might do it, but it is generally a disappointment and not up to the task."
5,Any Hendrix album is gold,"This is a great Greatest Hits compilation. The best known Hendrix songs are here such as ""Purple Haze"", ""Fire"", ""All Along the Watchtowe"", and the brilliant ""Voodoo Child"". This is a nice introduction into the world of the single greatest guitarist in history, but does not fully showcase his genius. The songs are overly produced taking away from the raw power his guitar exudes. To get a better feel of Hendrix get one of his 4 studio albums, or some live stuff such as ""Hendrix: Live At Woodstock"". Not the definitive hendrix collection, but for what its worth, certainly worth purchasin"
5,A gift,"I bought it as a gift and the recipient loves it. Hendrix is to ""acid rock"" for me. Its good for a Hendrix cd."
5,"A complete collection, Hendrix.","A very concise, and thorough collection of his very best music. As someone who recently turned-on to this man's music I can truly recommend this as one of the best best-of's I've ever heard."
5,"excellent, excellent cd","A great cd for any Hendrix fan. has everything on it. All his great blues work, and the more popular songs like all along the watchtower and bold as love."
5,THE MASTER...,"THIS IS THE KIND OF GUY THAT BORNS EVERY 1000 YEARS, HE'D A GREATER UNDERSTANDING OF MUSIC AND RIFFS (MAYBE DRUGS HELPED) BUT, IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A GREATESTS HITS CD, THIS IS THE ONE."
4,Isn't there something missing...?,"I love Hendrix's music, and bought this because it brings his best together...except this CD is missing ""Are You Experienced?"". Did anyone else notice this oversight?"
5,AMAZING!,"If you're only going to buy one Jimi Hendrix cd, or one cd for that matter, make it this one!"
2,CD advertised as factory sealed - it was not,"it was advertised that this product (CD) would be brand new and factory sealed. It was not factory sealed. It was just ""wrapped up"" without the familiar factory seal. Upon examining the CD surface, there were some scratches although the CD played well and without problems. I hate to suspect that this was a good used CD, sold as new, but I have not proof."
2,Hate me for it but someone had to say it,"I don't think anyone can deny that Jimi Hendrix was a great guitarist. But musical prowess alone does not a good album make, y'know what I'm saying? In my opinion, people were so caught up with Jimi's talent as a musician that they failed to notice (on the most part) that his talents as a song-writer were very simple. Much of these songs are very standard and merely impress with Jimi soloing over them. Add to that that much of what Jimi did was improvisation with little direction and what is left is really rather boring. Purple Haze and Voodoo Child are great songs, but the fact that many people have only heard of them (they wouldn't hear names like If 6 Was 9 or The Wind Cries Mary and think ""Aaah! Jimi Hendrix"") may explain why.I know I've done little here except make a load of people angry but I'm not afraid to speak out against the greats if I don't like them."
2,Most of Jimi Does not stand too well over the years...,"Clearly, CREAM ,at their flying best, cruise all over Jimi's experience. A lot of Jimi's super-rockers don't sound much better than fuzz-toned noise. Can anyone, beyond rock fans who may not have explored much else, seriously suggest that ""Are You Experienced"", ""Purple Haze"", ""Crosstown Traffic"",""Manic Depression"", ""Fire"" and most of the others, can be listened to on a regular basis? They're too loud, and tuneless,and they even seemed so to this grizzled Boomer when he first heard them ages ago. Still, Jimi was close to a wizard with his unique guitar work,melody,and lyrics on three slow ones: ""Wind Cries Mary"", ""Little Wing"", and ""Castles Made of Sand"",three songs which even CREAM could not improve on if they tried."
3,"Good music, but....","This guy is definitely one of the most highly overrated guitar players, if not the most highly overrated, of all time. I love his songwriting, but his solos are simple blues with a lot of screaming manipulated overdrive, and he plays SO sloppy!! I would probably like Hendrix a lot more if he wasn't constantly called the best guitarist ever. I think Jimmy Page (and many others, see my reviews on Symphony X) is way ahead of this guy!! I've never seen a guitarist get so much respect for setting his guitar on fire. I know everyone is going to rip me and say, you haven't heard ALL of his stuff. Well, I have, including his ""Blues"" album. If you want to hear blues done better, check out Stevie Ray Vaughan."
5,*Speechless*,"I love this CD!! It has to be one of the best CD's ever!! Jimi Hendrix is my favorite artist/band!!! If you are thinking about buying this...stop thinking and start BUYING!! This CD owns and i have no bias...so this is the best!!It does have some shorts songs..i dunno why they did this...but they shortened ""Purple Haze, Fire and Crosstown traffic"" for some reason...But this is one of the best Hendrix or any other ppls..EVER!! Except for My Jimi Hendrix Experience Box Set...Which is also a VERRRY GOOD BUY!!! THis is the best BUY IT!!!"
5,Still Rockin'!!,"When Jimi ""The master of rock"" Hendrix moves his graceful fingers over the strings in the first notes of the first song, ""Purple Haze,"" something will say to you, ""Man, that's cool!"" Maybe there is a reason we're still talking about him so long after his death."
5,"Great Cd and Better than ""Smash Hits""","The first Jimi Hendricks' cd I baught was ""Are You Experienced?"" The second one I baught was one called ""Smash Hits."" Like ""Smash Hits"" this is a compilation cd of Jimi Hendrics' work. In my opinion however, this is better than ""Smash Hits."" The main reason is that this cd has more variety. Most of the songs on ""Smash Hits"" are from ""Are You Experienced?"" All of the songs on this cd are great. My personal favorite is ""Voodoo Child (slight Return)."" The Woodstock version of the ""Star-spangled Banner"" is pretty cool as well. If your new to Hendricks, this is a great cd to get. The cd's great, and the songs are all great. Jimi Hendricks was a great guitarist who died to soon, and the songs on this cd are a testament to his greatness."
5,Good!,Jimi Hendrix is a great singer/musicion and I highly recommend this album! Btw' I wouldn't take the review by the dude who calls himself 85 Delorean too seriously. Go to his home page and read his reviews and than come back and tell me you don't think he is just someone trying to be silly and thinks he's being funny and clever in his reviews. He's obvioulsy looking for attention and trying to get a rise out of people!
2,Too few late stuff,"I think that artist whose all albums are good does not need any collections. They are just for money making purpose. Never buy collection if the artist has good albums to offer.My major complaint is that there are too few late stuff. From unfinished album there should be Freedom, Angel, Room Full of Mirrors, Ezy Ryder, Drifting and In From the Storm. Maybe Stepping Stone too. Dolly Dagger and Night Bird Flying that are included, are not so good as those tracks I listed above.Of course, to make album more comprehensive, there could have been some Band of Gypsys track in the end. And why not something like Pali Gap? Also Burning of the Midnight Lamp and Long Hot Summer Night (both from Electric Ladyland) would have been better than some tracks included - not to mention the title track from Electric Ladyland, in which Jimi proves how great singer he can occasionally be."
5,"""Experience Hendrix"" is perfect","I don't know what 'ol Ludwig the 2nd a few reviews up is talking about (inept lyrics?), but there is nothing at all wrong with this CD. All the songs are great; I recommend it to everyone."
5,Awsome,Jimi is by far one of the greatest artists of our time.... his music has a lock on this world that will never stop.. the music will live on forever and so will his spirit
5,the best hendrix collection,this collection of songs is bigger than are u experienced and contains hendrixs remake of all along the watchtower so this is the one to buy today hendrixs music is just as important as it was 35 years ago this collection has all his biggest hits along the watch tower fire the wind crys mary hey joe purple haze foxy lady it even has his version of the star spangled banner that he played at woodstock there will never be another jimi hendrix and this cd is the best collection of his timeless music all so called guitarist regardless of style owe this man a debt for changing the way people view guitar and rock n roll
1,sample silliness,horrible cd - i feel like i am listening to samples of music on amazon or itunes - how could anyone think that they are listening to hendrix? i was suspicious when i looked at the back of the cd and saw the song lengths were so short but i got suckered in by the cheap price for so much music - in this case you get what you pay for - i would not recommend this cd to any hendrix lover - every song fades out - that is not the way the songs end - it as if there is no meaning or originality in the way a song ends - and that is not the way they are in the original recordings
4,Good collection for casual Hendrix fans,"I am not really a fanatical fan of Jimi Hendrix however I do enjoy listening to his more well known songs. This CD is just fine for that purpose. It has many of his famous songs and is good to listen to when your in that sixties mood. All Along The Watchtower is the standout, due in part to Bob Dylan's great lyric, but Hendrix's performance does the song justice. Other favourites are Stone Free, The Wind Cries Mary and Angel."
5,Work of genius,"I was a total newbie to Hendrix's music. I had heard him played on the radio occasionally or on a friend's stereo, but never really paid much attention until I listened to this album. I do not want to get into details besides saying that the music is amazing. There are not many musicians of such deep genuine talent. The worst track on this album is way better than what many popular modern bands could ever hope to muster. Hendrix's style is original and very recognizable, and I fell in love with his music from the first serious listen. Nobody plays the electric guitar like he does. Now I know that eventually I will go out an buy more of his albums. If you are new to Hendrix, start here."
5,His best on one collection,"What you have here is the greatest Rock guitarist in history playing his best songs.These are from all phases of his career. All of his hits are included as well as some of his lesser known songs.If you want to get the Best of Jimi Henrix on one CD this is the one to get.Purple Haze, Foxey Lady, Fire, Vooddoo Child. All along the Watchtower, The Wind Cries Mary, Freedom, Angel, Dolly Dagger, Little Wing. You name it and its on here........Enjoy"
3,More than meets the eye,"You can expect more from Triangulation than what the blurb on the back of the book says. Its an interesting story of the intertwined lives of three young people in post-war England. Its provides an great historical setting. You feel as if you are living in the fall of the British colonialism. The details are amazing, but its really the character development that makes this book good. John, Helen and Laurance become so real that you are anticipating their next move. You're not surprised when they do what they do because you knew it was in them. Its amazing that an author so young could write a period piece like this."
4,lovely holiday tales,"John Rutter has created some of the best choral music around. In this CD, he shows his playful side with three stories sung with narration. Two (The Reluctant Dragon and Wind in the Willows) are based on books by Kenneth Grahame. Brother Heinrich's Christmas is solely by Ritter. the singing and narration are flawless, with every word audible. This is an album to enjoy over and over. A keeper!"
3,Beautiful bracelet,"This is a beautiful piece, I do wish it was adjustable, however. No fault of the seller whatsoever. Arrived in a timely manner."
1,cheap plastic parts,We had this model for only 3 or so years and a cheap internal plastic part broke and made the faucet useless and prone to leaks. Repair wasn't possible; had to replace the entire faucet.
3,I'm Left Wondering Why?,"I really didn't care for this story. Tey is a good writer, and this book is superlative when it comes to characterizations, but the mystery(?) is less than exciting. Grant is wonderful, and here we see an urbane Grant who has to go to the country to follow up the disappearance of a young man that he had met once at a cocktail party. He follows all clues, and comes up empty (even to dragging the river twice), but once back at home in London after awhile, the pieces come together and he figures it out. The denouemnet is quite good in this book, but again, the book didn't excite me."
4,An enjoyable mystery,"This is one of Josephine Tey's lesser known mysteries. ""Daughter of Time"" and ""The Franchise Affiar"" are, perhaps better known. This novel is in the Inspector Grant series and concerns the disappearance of a young man whom Grant had met briefly at a party.The writing and atmosphere of this novel are both excellent. Unlike some other Tey novels, I enjoyed this one more for the characters and setting, rather than plotting. Tey has a fine ear for dialogue and humor and Grant is a pleasure to go detecting with."
3,"Not one of her greatest, but fun.","This is one of Tey's more by-numbers mysteries. She departed from formula with the great Daughter of Time, Franchise Affair and Miss Pym Disposes, all of which break new ground in utterly different ways. But this one gets weirder as it goes along. As well as a puzzle, it is a critique of the popular novels of the day. Does it come before or after Daughter of Time? Here we meet the authors whose works the bedridden Grant finds unreadable in Daughter. Silas Wheatley, whose speciality is the agricultural saga with added dirt. The charming Lavinia Fitch, who has no illusions about the soppiness of her heroines. Conveniently they, and actress Marta Hallard (also a character in Daughter) all live in the same quaint village they have gleefully discovered."
1,Flimsy Mat,I own two mats with the same design and have also seen some recently in stores which are no longer available. The mats I own and have seen in stores are much heavier and thicker. I have the two I purchased still in the packages because it is not worth paying for postage to return them and I am still using my old mats. They are inexpensive but not worth buying (in my opinion).
1,Don't Buy This One!,"I thought I would love this recording, but it is slow and the voices do not blend at all. Vickers is just not up to this and has a hard time blending with the other more lyrical voices. The tempo is boring. The recording is not very clear either. Caballe is good, but not at her best. I saw a performance of her in the 1980's doing this and it was incredible. But there was no energy in this. I have several recordings and this one is my least favorite. See the original Price, Ellias, Bjorling and Ellias recording. Now that is perfection."
3,dsishwasher cleanser,"This dishwasher cleanser is okay. It helps to remove some of the residue that builds up in a dishwasher because of lime and other minerals in the water. It was the first product I used to remove the build up in my dishwasher. It didn't completely clean the inside of the dishwasher. I used Lemi Shine, another product, after this product and the Lemi Shine finished the dishwasher cleaning job."
5,Saved us a fortune,"We have a 4-year-old Bosch dishwasher. After a while the dishwasher arms started to get clogged and the dishes were coming out dirty. I had to unclog the arms again and again.Eventually, the dishwasher stopped working completely. The repair guy said that the motor housing had become clogged with food, and we needed a new motor. That cost us a few hundred bucks.Several months later, the problem started again. A different repair guy came this time, and he said that the problem was not calcium buildup inside the unit, not food, and that a dishwasher cleaner would solve the problem.None of the stores seemed to have what I needed, so I searched online and found Dishwasher Magic. One use, and the dishwasher was running like new. Now, I use it once every three months, and the unit comes out sparkling clean. There have been no problems since."
3,did help,the proucted did help. I had called the repairman & he told me that this product would solve my problem. So it is recommeded by a repairman
3,Way over priced on Amazon!,Go to your local supermarket and find the same size product for just over $3 compared to over $9 on Amazon. What is the deal with this anomaly??
2,overpriced online,find it at your local grocery store for almost two-thirds to half the price here. You'll still save money even driving a gas guzzler to just go out and pick this up at a local store.
5,Lives up to its name...MAGIC,"Our dishwasher is several years old, and in pulling a ""stray"" spoon out of the bottom I realized it had a significant amount of film. In addition, the bottom rack rolled out like it was driving down a rocky road - bumping up and down the whole way. I bought Dishwasher Magic to clear up the film, but now the bottom rack glides like it is new - must have been some buildup on the rollers as well. The inside is sparkling clean as well. I had not necessarily noticed reduced performance of the dishwasher, but hoping this spiked the performance as well. But either way, it did what I purchased it for and more. Will make part of my regular maintenance."
2,Didnt work for the moldy smell,I was so excited to use this product on our stainless steel dishwasher. It is only a couple of years old but has begun to smell like mold inside. I used this product as directed and I am not amazed with the results. The smell is the same and My dishwasher does look shiney but it never looked filmy in the first place and that was not my intended purpose for this product..
5,Dishwasher Magic,"We live in a hard water area and our dishwasher was looking pretty bad--hard water stains, squeaky drawers. I tried using a vinegar bath twice and it helped a little but still the stains were bad. I saw this product on the shelf at Walmart and thought, what could it hurt. On our first try, it almost restored the dishwasher to it's original condition. I was sold on this product right away. Dishwasher Magic will become a routine product that we use in our dishwasher. The slide out drawers almost lost their squeak, so I am pleased.Watsonville, California"
1,garbage,"Was having issues suddenly with the dishwasher not rinsing properly, so I picked this up and used it. Now I get white powder residue dried on all my dishes, even now MONTHS later! I cannot get rid of it!"
3,I may have had a severe case...,"I bought this a few months ago and used it in our old dishwasher. When I say old, I mean like 15 years old, so there was alot of yuck and buildup in there. I also have well water (hard water), so that leads to even more buildup.I used one bottle of Summit and only barely noticed a difference. I think maybe if I had used it a few more times I would have had better results. I give it 3 stars because I am not totally sure how well it works - I can't say it's amazing, as it did not totally clean up the dishwasher, but I can't honestly say it doesn't work either since my machine was old as dirt and as I said had alot going on with hard water etc.We have since gotten a new dishwasher, so I will keep this product in mind for future use. I do believe it is worth a try and I would buy it again, as well as recommemd it."
5,Fishbowl smell?,"Finally. In three different locations, over the past four years, I have seen a dishwasher clean dishes perfectly, only to smell of fishbowl after steady use. I tried all the recommended stuff--cleaned the bottom of the appliance, checked to see for any clogged material, everything. Finally, I stumbled upon this product--saved!One of these should be enough, though the product suggests that some washers will need two run-throughs (meaning purchasing two). It has a slight scent that you'll detect when washing, similar to the lemon scent in dish-washing detergent. Best of all, it works! Since using the product, no fish smell, not even a hint. I'm sure it'll return with time, but ""Dishwasher Magic"" suggests monthly use to maintain the benefits. Give it a try, and good luck!"
5,Cleaner inside our office's dishwasher,Our office's dishwasher gets so dirty and disgusting. With the Dishwasher Magic we see the insides of the dishwasher return to white and clean. This is a must have product for home and office. We received this promptly and put it to good use immediately.
2,First use not impressed.,"I may need to use this a few more times before I can give a good review but as of now I'm not impressed with it. It did not clean my dish washer at all. I love in a housing facility though with a very old washer that I'm sure has never been cleaned and we have terrible water, we're not even allowed to drink it. So like I said maybe a few more uses and I can change my review."
2,Disapointing,"Our dishwasher had a lot of soap buildup to the point that the main dispenser doesn't open up when it should and our dishes aren't getting very clean. I've looked online and tried a few methods (tang, vinegar, etc...) to no avail. So, I found a couple cleaners online and thought we would give them a try. I stared with Dishwasher Magic and had high hopes. When the cycle finished the bottle was empty but the inside of the washer hadn't changed. The detergent build up was still there. Moving on to the next one..."
2,Can't tell if this product makes any difference at all...,"Even if it does I don't believe the effect lasts too much - my dishes still need to bethoroughly rinsed before I load them.I can tell you however that my dishwasher (GE Model# GDWT368VSS) is very likely the WORST in the world. (Rest assured, you can always go wrong with a GE dishwasher.Yes, it is also an admission of sub-par intelligence since I bought another dishwasher from GE despite the terrible experiences with my previous dishwasher - from GE!!)"
3,Weaving rugs,"This is a thorough book, but difficult to understand for beginners. It is dry and complicated to get through and I would only recommend it as a reference, not necessarily a working book. There are others much easier to use for general rug weaving instruction."
2,Flimsy and cheap,"I bought these for my husband for Xmas and they are already shot. These are thin, cheaply made sneakers. Not really what I use to think of when I purchase Reebok but I guess they are the brand's really low end model."
4,the shoes are good but the shoelaces are not the same color as the picture,The shoes look so good except the shoelaces. If the color of shoelace is just like the picture (brown) it will be perfect!!!
2,Restricted flow,"Culligan Drinking Water Replacement Cartridge Carbon Block, 0.5 Micron, 1,000 Gallon Capacity #D-30The D-30 cartridge severely restricts water flow and nowhere on the packaging does it indicate this. I had to return them to amazon for a refund. Am using the D-10's with no noticeable reduction in water flow/pressure. Suugest that Culligan come up with some indication of water flow for each of their water filters. If water flow is not an issue for you, then the D-30's are probably fine."
4,cost effective filter,This product is the most cost effective among the Culligan home water filters. It last 1 year (or 1000 gallons) and performes well.
2,"Filters water, but too restrictive on flow.","Does a good job of filtering the water from what I can tell, but it reduces the flow rate to a trickle. Since I have this hooked to the cold water tap on the kitchen sink, that was unacceptable.I switched to the D-20A filter and it works great."
5,"5 stars for the seller, 4 stars for the price.",The filter is good. .5 micron is very good. The price is a little expensive.
5,Excelente filtro,El agua sale completamente limpia. Ideal para conectar a un grifo de beber y si se conecta a una tubería con una T también puede alimentar a la vez una refrigeradora con IceMaker. La cantidad de agua que sale es pequeña ya que es un filtro muy denso.
2,Culligan D-30A Filter system,"The filter system needs to be securely mounted to a wall fixture. Every time I change the filter it rips from the wall. I have tried up to 200lb. wall anchors. Meaning, the canister is hard to remove from the rest of the assembly. I upgraded to the D-30A filter and the water pressure dropped significantly compared to the D-20A filter. The filter works great and the water is better tasting and crystal clear. You just have to deal with the downsides of the rest of the product."
3,Culligan Level 2 Drinking filter,Used one time and took it off my camper. It decreased the water flow so much I barely had water coming out of the shower.
1,"Bad Ending, Cardboard Characters","This is a typical Sci-Fi network style story. Long on words, short on story. Essentially, the book is about a group of people who repeatedly are taken by aliens and chased by the evil mean military. This continues, and is repeated for several hundred pages and then ends.I do mean ends, nothing is resolved and the story just stops. I found myself examining the book to see if there were missing pages; there were not.I haven't seen the mini-series and now I wouldn't if I had the opportunity.If you feel like reading it, just read the first and last chapter. What is in between is just more of the same but with different cardboard characters.Bad."
4,Not as good as the Miniseries but still a good read.,"After watching the telivesion event I thought it would be nice to read the book. The characters arn't explained and two of my favorite scenes (In my opinion also important) was droped. To not spoil it if you haven't seen it I'll give you little clues: The scene were Chet Wakeman sends a very special E-Mail to Mary and the scene were Allie demonstrates here powers on Charlie. Anyways it was an interesting read, probably worth it, missing descriptive details though. Try it out for yourself, see how you like it."
4,"Okay as a novelization, definitely not a real novel","This novelization of the TV miniseries works well for the purpose for which I wanted it: to keep my memory of the miniseries alive until I can buy it on DVD, and for use as a refresher course if there should be a TV continuation before then. It certainly has no great literary merit. There are no descriptive passages; since it was clearly written before casting, characters can't be decribed even as to race. That omission is so glaring as to be distracting. And on the last page, the story does not so much end as simply stop. The miniseries brought it to a better conclusion."
2,Why?,"When I found out that Thomas H. Cook had written the book version of a soon to be released SF miniseries I was intrigued and couldn't wait to read it. Thomas H. Cook is the author of fifteen novels, including The Chatham School Affair, winner of the Edgar Award for Best Novel; Instruments of Night; Breakheart Hill; Mortal Memory, among others. Those have been some of the most interesting mysteries I have ever read. However, this book reads just like a TV miniseries, the characters are wooden without any real emotion and the events very predictable. So my question is why Cook even bothered doing this project???"
1,save your money,I was very disappointed. I really enjoyed the series and thought the book would be a great supplement. I hoped the book would expand off the series. No depth to the characters or the story line. Wait for the DVD.
1,Not even coherent,"Please do not read this book. Please. Doing so would only encourage more soulless novelizations of tv shows. I've had more fun reading the back of cereal boxes. And not fun kiddie cereals either, I mean the back of a box of Grape-Nuts."
2,"Confusing, Sporatic, Watch the Series Instead...","I've never read a book more spontaneous and jumpy in plot, than this one. I mean the plot has extreme potential, don't get me wrong. But each scene/chapter/whatever is so short, that by the time you get the picture as to what's going on, the scene ends and you fall right off the edge. I couldn't tell you who any of the characters in this book are or even what time period they're from. This book is all over the place with times, action, and sadness all mixed up together. Steven Spielberg knows how to make movies. This guy Thomas Cook, doesn't know jack about writing books. WATCH THE SERIES."
3,Taken (SPOILERS),"For anyone who has read this book, you have to admit, it has it's good parts. For anyone who hasn't read this, it's about alien abductions, their expierements, all that. I liked everything up to when Owen died. His granddaughter, Mary, wasn't just quite evil, or his son, Eric. Anyways, the story got very boring after the fifth or so part. I give this book 3 stars because the first half was good."
3,"TAKEN IS WORTH IT ,BUT THE ENDING IS NOT WELL","THIS BOOK IS GOOD FOR PEOPLE WHOM HAVE NOT WATCHED THE SERIES YET, JUST LIKE ME. IT WAS A VERY INTERESTING NOVEL INDEED AS IT EXPLAINS ALOT WHERE YOU WOULD NOT PROBABLY UNDERSTAND IN THE SERIES. AT NIGHT, IT TOOK ME A HARD TIME TO STOP READING IT AND GO TO SLEEP (LAUGH) BECAUSE ITS REALLY THAT EXCITING !!! UNFORTUNATELY, THE ENDING IS A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT AS IT WAS NOT EXPLAINED AS TO WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO ALLIE AFTER THE LIGHTS APPEARED, IT JUST SEEMED LIKE THE AUTHOR JUST DIED BEFORE FINISHING THE ENDING. SO, I HAD TO BORROW A VIDEO OF THE FINALE OF TAKEN, AND IT DID END THE STORY VERY WELL."
1,I don't care for this product.,"I hate to complain, but this vacuum has too much suction for this floor tool to work! It gets stuck to the floor or the carpet. I've tried adjusting it,but nothing works!"
4,Vac floor head was not as advertised,May be the new style which I had no experience with but so far seems ok but it was not what I wanted or thought I bought.
3,I like the design of the showel,It works great for a while. But I found out it dosent last for daily use the metal needs to be heavier for a professional roofer
4,Shingle Shovel,"The product was very satisfactory and shipped on a timely basis. Your catalog clearly indicated a bonus, small shovel would be included with the purchase of the large shovel. I mentioned this when I placed the order and was told the smaller shovel would also be included in the shipment. It was not with the shipment.Nelson Miller317-392-1187"
3,Decent Biography,"Clever Maids is a decent read, about the female sources of the fairy tales we're accustomed to attributing to the Brothers Grimm, and has some biographical interest. But the author seems to have an axe to grind, which can get annoying. She keeps noting that the Grimms never thanked their female sources by name in their publications. Surely it would've been nice if they had, but I wonder if such public acknowledgment was really the custom in the early 1800s. The Grimms were folklorists--they never claimed to be the tales' original authors.Still, nice to know a bit more about the Grimms and their process for collecting and setting down stories. The book is less interesting for its analysis of the tales, which is (to say say the least) not subtle. For fairy tale analysis, I prefer Maria Tatar's Off With Their Heads."
2,Beautiful but not enough,"This is a handsome edition, but it doesn't have any notes defining the many arcane and archaic words Melville uses. While I was reading it, I had to look up tons of words. I ended up saving my notes and making an online annotation of the book (Power Moby-Dick). Unless you have read this book before, have a massive vocabulary, or want to refer to the web all the time, this is not the edition for you.The book does include helpful whaling and sailing diagrams at the back, but it also has a map of the Pequod's voyage that gives away the book's ending--don't look at the map if you don't want to know!"
2,Not what I expected at all,"Turns out this is not pornography of any kind. I was seriously misled, I mean look at the cover of the book! Seriously! It started off teasing me with Ishmael and Queequeg in bed, so it gets a bonus star. Sadly, it goes downhill from there and takes its sweet time to get there too."
2,"Before You Finish, You're Cheering for the Whale...","If you are interested in learning how to be a Whaler, then this is certainly the book for you. If, on the other hand, you innocently pick up this book because of it's outsized reputation, you are going to be dreadfully disappointed. For an adventure book there is frighteningly little adventure; for a philosophical book, there is amazingly little philosophy. What there is is information on how to hunt whales and tedious times between whale spottings.If you want to read an old classic, go with something by Dickens instead. If you want a new classic, try my first novel, ""Fate"" by Mary Jane. Thanx for listening."
1,Are you kidding?,"Everybody said I should read Under the Volcano, so I did. Complete waste of time. Everybody squared said I should read Moby-Dick. Skipping the chapters on whale biology and seamanship and the whaling arts, you have about an 80-page story of a madman trying to catch a whale that he must know will kill him. But then, he's mad, isn't he? Put this one in the Under the Volcano bin. There are times when I know I'm in the presence of great literature that as not written for readers like me. This was not one of those times."
4,The American Ulysses,"After hearing a great radio program on this book (Studio 360 on WNYC, you can listen online) I decided to finally bite the bullet and read it.It was hard! My gosh! You get sucked in at the start with a great story and QueQueg in the bed and the church service but suddenly it breaks down into a chapter on all the different whales in the sea (which was interesting to me for how little understanding Melville had) and why whales are actually fish (if you really want to know about fish, check out Fish, His Manners And Morals) and all the items used on a whaler etc. etc.Some scenes are written out like a play which reminds me of Ulysses.My favorite part was when they sailed out over a really clear bit of water filled with whales and they looked down and saw whales fighting, whales giving birth, whales making love all down at different levels.The writing is so dense! I could only read like a chapter a night. But the chapters are really short so that makes it doable. Good luck!"
5,Moby Dick,"Herman Melville's book, ""Moby Dick"" with foreword by Nathaniel Philbrick is presently being read by my book study group. We are almost 3/4 of the way through, and I have to say that I am now a big fan of Herman Melville. I learned that Melville is considered America's greatest writer, and I can believe it. Some in my group read this book when they were in high school, but are enjoying it even more the second time around. It is not only a story told to perfection, but it's a book that offers landlubbers, as well as coastal residents, a chance to learn about whaling and the majesty of the ocean and it's inhabitants, with an emphasis on whales... the Sperm Whale in particular. Melville has a way of making the emotions felt by the many colorful characters in this book pertinent to all humanity. Read it. You'll like it. Or reread it and you'll like it again, only more so."
3,Get on With It...,"Okay - an interesting story and intriguing characters. I like the fact that we follow a reckless old sea-dog pursuing his ""prey"" to the detriment of his and his crew's lives. I also could relate to the symbolism and the balance of character traits portrayed by Ahab's gang. And, to tell you the truth, I found some of the maritime lore and whaling reports interesting... but Hey Herman! - were you trying to write a story or a friggin' encyclopaedia.This novel wasn't met with much success at the time of writing? Well I wonder why. More emphasis on the grizzled old osprey's thoughts and actions; and curtail your descriptions of sperm whale anatomy, diminsh the indexing of butcher-tools and keep the examples of uses of oil down to a cool dozen or so.Overall - a documentary with an interesting story line hiding in the details."
4,I love this song!,I first heard this song at a school assembly given by MADD (mother's against drunk driving) I thought it was really good. Then the next day I heard it on the radio.... It was on the top 10 and I have to agree with them. It rocks!
3,Good for beginners or for children,"If you're thinking about getting pigeons, or if you have a child interested in them then this book is fine. If you want more detail on the different breeds, diseases, reproductive system/cycle, or behavior then this book isn't for you. It's not an expensive book and makes for a nice little read, but if you're hardcore pigeon folk then you'll come away from this book disappointed."
3,It's ok...,"Didn't go into the fancy breeds much. Most of the pix were illustrations, would have preferred photos of the real thing. Also didn't go into any of the various pigeon sports besides plain pigeon racing. There's got to be a better pij book out there."
2,Goes beyond typical pet guardianship,"This book included the information I needed to properly care for a pigeon, but as a person concerned about ethical behavior towards animals used as pets, I thought it was encouraging breeding and using the animal for human desires, rather than putting the interest of the bird as a priority. I would not recomend this book for that reason."
2,Alright,"This book was alright, not what I was looking for. Ira a little to wordy for my 2 and 5 year old, and the illustrations were just okay."
1,"Biased, Liberal Propaganda To Influence Young Children's Thinking","After reading this book to my son, I was struck by how overt the message was to young readers that politics and your right to vote is a simple game played between the morally conscious, multi-cultural individual with the benevolent, compassionate and ""correct beliefs"" who deserves your support and vote (i.e. Liberal Democrat) VS the ""other"" side which represents a ""mean-spirited"" privilaged white majority dedicated to greed (erecting stadiums), exhibiting a lack of compassion (...hates dogs) and does not support education. This is just a typical ""politically correct"" view that attempts to ""brainwash"" our children with the liberal agenda that the educational establishment so richly supports."
4,Great live show - great cover,"Great cover of Tegan and Sarah's ""Walking With a Ghost"" (a nice seguay from ""Little Ghost"") with the Stripes' stamp on it. And a taste of the live shows too. More good stuff that showcases the Stripes tremendous live talent. A bit different than their recent release this stuff harkens back to earlier days."
3,"Not bad, but inessential.","If you're new to the White Stripes, don't get this album. Get one of the five LP's, which are all incredible. This is more for people who are already fans of the band. I actually don't care a whole great deal for the cover of Tegan & Sara's hit ""Walking with a Ghost,"" but it's alright. Actually, I liked the live tracks more. Even so, while they are all amazing Stripes songs, it is more like something intended for fans than anything else. I don't really think they're newer releases will be a template from this.On the other hand, a new album, ""Icky Thump"" is coming out in awhile. We'll see how that one turns out."
1,TERRIBLE cover of a great song,"Absolutely awful cover of a great song by Tegan & Sara.This is the worst vocal performance I've ever heard from Jack White, and the cover is totally uninspired. Almost a direct rip-off with added snares and low-fi production values.Skip it and stick with the original.Walking With a Ghost"
4,"great stuff, especially for collectors","The live stuff on here is great, I can never hear enough versions of ""Screwdriver"".The title track, a cover of a Tegan & Sara song, is great too. It actually served as a springboard for me to check out the original band, of whom I am now a big fan."
4,Veterinary Notes for Horse Owners,"The information is well organized, thorough and informative. I have used it to identify and verify situations with my three horses. The photos are great and give you additional info to consider. I would recommend this book to the horse lover who is concerned about her animals health."
2,Good political satire,"While not as good as Gulivers Travels, this book is an excellent political/religous satirical work. It started out slowly but the strong satire comes through loud and clear."
3,the humans are penguins!,those blasted penguins were baptised and changed into penguins! this satire depicts the history of France! enjoy! :)
5,A Book You'll Really Use,"There are some books you read and then put away and there are books you'll use. This is one you'll use. Swain tells us how to create all types of story characters, how to make them credible, how to describe them, how to motivate them and much more. The book's easy, fun-to-read style makes it ideal for beginners, though more experienced writers can profit as well. Every page offers something worthwhile!"
5,One of the best!,"Over the years I've bought a lot of books on writing, and I can honestly say that the insights presented here are among the practical and useful.Swain understands that characters are NOT folks but instead are constructs, partially based on folks and partially based on the author's needs.I can highly recommend this book."
2,Not the best out there,"This book is at once both informative and disorganized. The author, while I'm sure good intentioned, has haphazardly assembled a guide to writing that is full of fluff. It's so full of fluff, in fact, that you'll find yourself neck-deep in tangients trying to seperate the useful information from the numerous asides and messy explanations. At best, I consider this book to be a boondoggle (read as: wasted project)."
2,Don't waste your money,We bought this software for my 4 year old because he loves the rescue heroes toys. There just isn't much to this game. It is extremely limited. There are five modules and once my son had done them once that was it. It took 20 minutes. There are no additional levels and no challenges. The toys are great but I don't recommend this software game.
3,20 Minute Havoc-HELP!,"We bought this game for our 5 year old son. He loved it until he discovered he could do the entire thing in 20 minutes and that was the extent of the entire CD. Overpriced for its short life span. There are no other games or challenges included on the CD, so if you are after an exciting fun game - great - if you want more than 20 minutes of fun and excitement-keep on shopping!"
2,Dissappointed,"My 3-year-old is a huge fan of Rescue Heroes so we were excited to get him this game. However, the Rescue Heroes look different (my son is scared of Billy Blazes huge eyes,)and sound different than on his videos. Also the game is very limited. I expected a different level after he completed the first, but there was nothing more..."
2,nothing to it,"My five yeay old was completely finished in about 1/2 hour, except for printing out a bunch of stuff we didn't want."
5,Love the Rescue Heroes,"My grand children love the Rescue Heroes, and are sad they are not able to watch them often. These CD's were a much appreciated gift, and have been watched and enjoyed many times since Christmas.I was very happy to find these CD's on Amazon.Janet Bulow"
3,Odd Assortment of Material,"One of the dangers of spelunking through the more remote corners of musical genres and composers is that in spite of the best intelligence, sometimes the urge to explore something totally new turns up a dud. Now, I'm not saying Erik Satie is a poor or inconsequential or weak composer. It's just that this particular album does nothing to warm me to his music or encourage me to listen to it again. It's an odd collection of very different types of material, none of which quite matches my picture of Satie as a musical innovator. There are things which sound like conventional stage music and other pieces which sound like liturgical movements, and still others which are spoken word (French). This album won't turn me off Satie, but it will make me much more careful in selecting the next album of his works."
1,"1,000 More Jokes for Kids","I purchased this book for my niece who is 9 years old. The only thing I can say is.....we couldn't find anything funny about this book. My niece's comment was ""Didn't you read any of the jokes before you bought it""? I had to confess that I bought it on line."
5,A fascinating history of our linguistic oddities!,"This book provides a fascinating look at all those little sayings that we use so frequently but which make so little sense to people learning English. What does ""let the cat out of the bag"" mean? Or ""that's how the cookie crumbles""? Organized into short chapters that explore colloquialisms of similar origin, this book is interesting and amusing. It is not only an exploration of our linguistic oddities, but a survey of our cultural history and the effect that it has had in shaping our language. This book is a great little gift for anyone."
3,Good & Bad,"Item arrived quickly and well-packaged for shipping. Unfortunately, there were a couple of parts missing from the kit, although I don't blame Amazon for this, as it appeared to be a previous return or open box. Have since returned it (made painless by Amazon, BTW) and ordered another."
4,"Great music, little documentation","Boris Christoff's rendering of the Mussorgsky songs is a real treasure. Mussorgsky's songs are gripping, and Christoff's singing fine. One does wish, however, that the reissue on CD's included the words. I don't know Russian, and feel slightly short-changed by the lack. And putting the accompanists in a footnote at the bottom of the last page, referencing their performances only by track number, is a dis-service to them. Their solid musicianship is a critical part of the perfomances. If you can get a copy, I'd certainly say get it if classical song has any appeal whatsoever, but be prepared for sub-par documentation."
1,The image on the front page is not the correct book,"The main image here is not the correct book. They have the ""Portable Lit"" book cover on the front, and that is not correct. The other customer image is the more accurate one."
5,Great deal!,This book carries a ton of stories and the price cannot be beaten. Great variety of literature as well.
3,Review Sonic solider borgman,DVD was in great shape it looked fantastic. Unfortunally the old style anime doesn't do it for me. The story is a little dated and the voice work need to be tightened up.
2,Groovy Girls Doll,"Purchased this for my granddaughter who had a groovy girls doll and lost it. Nice doll as option to other popular ""fashion"" dolls; Clothes can be changed easily; too early to know about its durability. Clothing and accessories for this doll, I find, are not plentiful and are overpriced - hence I give it a rather low overall rating - I had anticipated being able to provide a nice wardrobe to go with this doll."
5,Excellent dvd!,This dvd is awesome! It shows a lot more than the tv version and it is worth the money. Any Shania fan will love it as well as non-Shania fans!
5,Simply Shania -- as she really is --,"For all Shania/Bluegrass fans this one's terrific. Because of the smaller audience, her performance along with world class blue grass fantastics - AKUS - provides solid entertainment along with insight into the real Shania. The ""personal approach"" of this DVD excells any of her performances to the masses. Jerry Douglas' performace immaculate, too."
4,Shania who????,"LOL I don't mind Shania, but to be honest I just got this because Alison Krauss and Union Station are her backing band for this live acoustic concert - adn they're brilliant! What generous, self-effacing people AK+US are to do this. Shania comes off as sounding good but a complete ditz in this."
4,Shania is Captivating!,"Shania is delightful and captivating in this relaxing show where she sings many songs from UP! and other favorites. She looks great and seems to enjoy being herself with the audience and the backup band. Union Station is excellent playing and singing with her. And Alison Krauss and Shania have fun bantering back and forth, as well as producing wonderful harmonies."
2,Have seen better,"I like very much Shania Twain - but after having seen Live from Chicargo, this video does not deliver the action of Shania Twain"
4,Wish Shania Would Stick With The Music She Does Best - Country!,"This dvd shows Shania's potential as a serious musician. With Alison Krauss and Union Station as her back up here, she is simply riveting. Too bad she is more interested in making a quick buck these days marketing herself as a pop star and making purely pop albums like ""Up!"" instead of making enduring popular country classics like ""The Woman In Me"" and ""Come On Over"". Maybe she's living too well nowadays to make soulful music. Get this dvd if you want to hear Shania doing something good.4 Stars is for the short length of this dvd. We need at least 2 hours of this awesome music. Not the 50 minutes which is on this dvd. That's only enough time to drink 5 beers."
4,Stories,"""Stories"", put together by Jennings and Calitri, is an amazing collection of thirty-two of the best short stories of all time. They include a variety of topics, and different reading levels for all ages. Whether it may be a read-aloud or a high school senior, this book is satisfying for everyone. Along with these great short stories, poems that relate to them, have been added at the end of many of the stories to go along with the themes. The three sections of the book include, ""Stories of Impact"", ""Stories of Depth"", and ""Stories to Think About"". You will not get bored with the selection and you're guaranteed to want more. From cannibals, to loving fathers, to haircuts, it has everything. In my opinion, this is the best selection of short stories ever."
4,How to Quit Drinking without AA,"This author is thorough and positive. He describes many factors which can be helpful in recovery. Many people with alcohol abuse difficulties do not want to attend AA for one reason or another. Mr. Dorsman is able to describe an alternative process,and maintain a positive outlook. It is refreshing. I will admit, however, that a few of his descriptives were a bit far fetched. Generally a good alternative book about alcohol abuse and recovery."
2,I'm not an alcoholic,Okay so I bought this for my dad and It doesn't seem to of had an impact on him. But then again he may not be ready to quit. So maybe it would work for someone who is. So maybe take a chance?!?!
4,AA is NOT the only way...,"This book was OK. But you should know that AA is not the only way to stop drinking/using drugs. It does work for a lot of people but not everyone. Try SMART recovery, too - they are an alternative to AA that is based on research. Definitely great - no need to buy ANY book!"
2,to each their own...,For those who get what they need from this book; are able to stop or control their drinking... Our hats are off to you!
4,a desolate railway,"Here's a little known connection between Afghanistan and Australia. In the 19th century, camels were imported from the Middle East, along with Arab and Afghan drivers. Well, many camels got loose and bred in the Australian Outback. The legacy of this was that the railway going from Alice Springs was called the Ghan, after those Afghani drivers.The book is a short rendition of how the railway finally got to be built. Fuller describes the desolation of the Outback and the many obstacles met. The railway did not have the significance of the continent spanning lines in the US and Canada. The volume of traffic on the railway after it was built was rather modest. But at least for Australians, the account is a footnote in the nation's development."
3,Not for younger Thomas fans,"Our 4 year-old is excited about Thomas the Tank Engine characters, but I don't think he understands the points which these stories are making. I think he likes the *idea* of it being a Thomas book more than he enjoys listening to these stories themselves. He is just as happy to look briefly at the pictures while I summarize the story.I know that the stories intend to teach good moral lessons, but I am sometimes uncomfortable about how they attempt to do this. For example, James is rude to some less polished train cars, so they take delight when James' resentful freight cars make James crash, causing tar to get all over James' nice paint job. The underlying message (don't be rude to others) may be lost on children who see all the characters behaving in unkind ways toward others."
1,"Poorly written, not recommend buying","Both my children love Thomas the Tank Engine. We have several British books from the Thomas Series. This one is a disappointment, the story is not well written, the grammar is poor and the stories are confusing with no clear flow. On the possitive side the pictures are nice and my toddler likes to look at them.I'm sorry I bought this book."
2,unpleasant stories in the Thomas canon,"This little book includes four stories -- ""James in a Mess"", ""Bertie's Chase"", ""Percy and the Signal"" and ""Percy Proves a Point"". Each story is accompanied by photographs from the video series. My complaint is that the stories are confusing and not well told."
3,"Good stories, but poor illustrations (photographs)","The books consists of the traditional James stories. However, the illustrations are replaced by photographs from the videos. I believe, making the book look darker and less appealing to my three year old. My recommendation--look for an edition with the original illustrations."
1,Cheaply made,This punch broke on me after the second use. Poorly made. Would suggest the Anytime Tools Metal hole punch. It has several sized bits and you just have to hit the punch with a hammer. It hasn't failed me yet and remains sharp after many uses. Stay away from this SE tool and get the Anytime one.
3,SE Leather Hole Punch,I had to punch several times to get the whole made. The puncher slipped out of position several times. It appeared to be unstable on the garment and moved before I could punch my belt.
4,I get what I want,"This product exactly did(does) its job for the money. Plus, it was shipped really fast right to my front door."
4,"Works pretty well, could be sharper.","I was too lazy to find a professional to punch the holes in my new belt for me, so I bought this and decided to do it myself. Well it works okay, but it's not sharp enough to cut cleanly through on the first punch, and impossible to line up exactly when you punch it again and.. well you do the math. So for me it was pretty hard to cut perfectly round holes with this. But for the price, it certainly did its job."
1,Not heavy duty leather hole punch,This item is definitely not for thicker leather hole punch. It won't work well if you try to punch a bigger hold on a medium thick leather. You get what you paid for.
3,looks like used item,This puncher works okay but it does really look like used item. And it needs a lot a effort to punch through the hole and you may need to punch it twice or more to cut it through.
1,Didn't work,Bought this to punch holes in a leather belt and it didn't work. It wouldn't go through. A little disappointed in results.
1,Not So Good,"Bought this hole puncher hoping to punch my leather belt, but turn out the puncher is not sharp to make the hole and my belt is ruin! Not recommended to people. Quality 1/10 rating!"
2,Don't waste your money...,"This item had many good reviews, so I decided to purchase. I am disappointed, however, with the lack of ability that this so called ""leather"" hole punch delivers.If you are attempting to puncture through a cheap leather belt, or something of the sort, then by all means, this is the choice for you. If you are like me, though, and need something to go through quality leather, then keep looking."
1,Just Plain Junk,"The first time I tried to use it I didn't realize that the ""hole puncher' that cuts into the leather wasn't aligned properly and therefore wasn't fully cutting the leather. Thinking that the leather was just too tough, I pressed a little harder and the whole thing bent in on itself. I may have just crushed it or the metal and/or construction is faulty (which is my opinion). Luckly I was able to bend it back and also bend the little metal piece that holds it in alignment to its rightful position. But I doubt that this arangement will hold out very long. I would recommend just getting a punch that you whack with a hammer. Those are much more durable and reliable."
1,Sorry Piece of Equipment,"Wish that I had read the reviews before I purchased! Should have know that the price was too good to be true. The wheel is not in line with the pad to punch on and the tool is not adequate to punch through belt leather. Heavy duty is not truthful. May be adequate for watch bands or shoe straps, but not for anything of good leather."
3,Kisa,"I slightly disappointed. Even I will not send back this item-(the reason that shipping cost wouldn't be worth it), I am disappointed because as soon as I received it and tried to work this puncher-a little detail which is fixing the support- fell off. It can be worker without that detail, but still"
4,love it!,i have been looking to buy a hole punch for my belts and i was skeptical about this product before i laid my hands on it few days ago. It absolutely works and my belts have now found a new life and changed my clothes.love it!
2,Hard to Punch,"When I used this product to punch holes in rather thick leather, the punch catcher (the little bronze-ish disk on the opposite side os the size wheel) did not catch the punch in the center, creating a punch that was not quite completed on one side. Not good for punching thick leather, nope.-The one and only Lambo Bovino"
5,"Leather hole punch Tool, Heavy Duty",This tool was very well worth the money. It did the job and was easy to use. Far better then the one it replaced.
3,Good for the money. Cheaply made,Broke with the first use. Some lock to stop the puncher wheel from turning broke right off.Very fragile in that sense but it did the job.
1,Junk,"Price should tip you off. Cheaply made. Notches to lock the punches in position over the anvil are not aligned. Therefore the punches do not contact the anvil surface. If positioned out of the ""locked"" position they can be made to work. But, the punches are so dull that it's almost impossible to cut through a leather belt. Hardly what I would call ""Heavy Duty"".Don't waste the shipping fee buying this item."
1,don't waste your money.,"Punched only three holes. On the attempt at a fourth hole, the piece locking the size selector in place bent, misaligning the hole punch with the base, making the tool useless."
4,Leather punch,This leather punch does a great job. It's not as heavy duty as others I have owned but is worth the money I spent for this one.
4,Great Tool fro a low price,"used the tool to makes holes for spikes in some denim & leather pieces, && turned out great.....not reccommended for heavey/repeated use tho..but good for simple stuff"
2,Save your money!,"This is not a very good product and I would not suggest it to anyone. I had to file and sharpen edges myself and it still wasn't a very good product. Save your money and buy a better, quality product."
1,poor product and poor seller,"do not buy this product and do not buy from this seller. First of all, this SE Leather Hole Punch Tool, cannot be used to punch my leather belt.....no matter how tight you squeeze the handle. I ended up having to use a scissor/knife to assist to get it done. Then, when I tried to contact the seller to return, I never got a reply. Wasted my money.The item did not arrive in time as promised. And there is no tracking. If the product is ever lost, given the seller's track record like this, you can never get your money back."
4,"cheap, reliable",Works pretty well for what i need. seems pretty sturdy. Wouldn't be my choice for dress belts and would be better with ovsl or elongated hole.
1,Horrible,"Its a waste of money, and it didn't last long, after few miserable uses, i ended up throwing it in the trash. The first time i used it i realized that it didn't punch the properly, i ended up using the awl to complete the job, the punches are not properly aligned."
1,This tool is terrible!,"Unable to close the pins, is of poor quality material, 3 of 6 nozzles were damaged, and no good, I lost my money with this tool."
1,Terrible....,Brand new out of the package....big piece of junk. Wasted my time and effort. Not a happy camper. Where is the quality assurance and vendor integrity??
1,Poor Quality,"The cutting mechanism is not properly aligned to begin with, so that the hole does not punch properly. Beyond this, the metal in the tool itself is not very strong, so if you press too hard you will bend it, rendering it completely useless."
1,Not worth it,"When the punch arrived, one of the tubes wasn't even there. The others did not come in vertical to the anvil and would not have done a very good job. The only good thing I can say is that I didn't even have to return the item to get a full refund. I just tossed it in the trash. I then ordered the C.S. Osborne punch and that has been great. Buyer beware."
2,Not a sturdy too!,"When you try punching through leather with this tool, the punch wants to move to the next punch setting. It is a flaw in the design of the locking wheel. I guess they wanted to make it simple for people switching punch sizes, but that easy switching is a detriment to the punch. The punch will move off center, so when appling force you are not using all of the punch bit making it difficult to get a good accurate hole, or get a clean hole for that matter. I am not punching anything more than leather belts, FYI. I would recommend buying a fixed punch style, and save your money by not buying this model. I have a suggestion for a modification of this tool, but of course suggestions don't come free :)"
3,Not completely satisfied,"The tool worked as designed however there is a fairly flimsy little piece of metal that holds the selected bit in place. After punching 1 hole in 4 or 5 belts the little metal piece broke rendering the tool useless.Other than that ""single point of failure"" the tool is sturdy and very easy to use."
4,Nice Leather Puncher,"The hole puncher works pretty well. Only negative is that it doesn't allow for much space for the belt between the puncher and the base. I have to squeeze the belt into the gap. Otherwise, can't complain."
3,Leather Hole Punch Tool,Did it's job however the holes were not clean. Had to do some additional cutting to clean up the area.
3,Leather punch,The product works good for the price. It could be made a bit stronger. Not a tool for heavy leather or a lot of use. Best for the occasional belt hole etc.
5,PERFECT !!,"I bought this couple of weeks back and it works perfect, good for the price. I tried couple og my leather belts it worked as expected."
3,Poor quality control.,"It arrived missing the 3mm hole punch. The different sizes of punches are just pressed in to the holes on the spinning size selection cylinder. The remaining punches feel like they will probably stay attached to the cylinder. If you are looking for a cheap leather punch, this will work. If you want a nicer leather punch, then you should spend a little more."
2,wimpie and nd cull and,Metal is thin and tool is not sharp enough for me to punch holes…needed the brute strength of a man to be able to utilize this tool for completion of project.
3,SE Leather hole punch,Its ok product but not that I was looking fo rquality is ok but it worked for me only bad part is leather got stuck in hole and hard to remove
4,Good product,"Maybe because my belt is kind of thick, so I took efforts to punch a hole.But I think it is a good product."
1,GARBAGE,"Save your money, made in China complete piece of crap. I had better luck getting the hole punched in my leather belt with a phillips head screwdriver and a thick oversized bar rag."
1,"Cheaters, switched item for cheaper punch twice!!","We ordered this item and the cheaper hole punch was sent to us. Thinking it was an error, we ordered it again only to again receive the cheaper punch--again. At first it seemed that it would be easy to get a refund. But, two weeks passed after we returned the first item and Amazon claimed not to have received it. It was quite a fight to finally get our refund. We never got the correct item and fear that many people may also get the cheaper item and just not realize it. We will never order again from etoolscity or from Amazon. Very disappointed!! What cheaters!!!"
1,Useless Product-Avoid it,"This product has proved to be useless for me, because I'm unable to punch holes in my belts, all because the manufacturers didn't leave enough gap between the hole-puncher and the bottom where I'm supposed to place the belt. As a result, I was unable to place my belts that have regular thickness (purchased at regular stores/malls-nothing fancy), in between the base and hole puncher properly and if they are not properly aligned, then the hole puncher can leave ugly marks on your belt where you don't want them to be seen.I would have given it 0 stars if I could because there's no utility. So, if you have a belt of regular thickness, then avoid this."
2,Help!!,"Please! I tried using it and not get either in paper or plastic, much less in leather. Anyone know of a video showing the use. Thank you very much."
1,It doesn't work.,"This is a fancy looking product but it is a very poor leather punch. I had to go back to my old ""plain jane"" leather punches, which worked much better."
2,"One worked, the other did not",Ordered two of these. One worked OK. The other did not. Punch was not alight properly and could not be fixed.
1,piece of junk,"Most of Tandy leather's tools are junk. This is no exception. Rotating tip doesn't ensure perpendicular contact with the leather, because the locking mechanism has too much play. As a result the hole maybe crocked or misplaced. Just avoid this one and buy non-rotating punch from Osborne"
4,Fit the bill,"A bit difficult to use, and hard to empty the holes of the punched leather (or whatever). But it served the purpose, my belts now fit!"
1,"Only used it once, then it was retired...","I used it to punched two holes on my leather belt, then dump it to the trash bin. Spent $8 dollars on it, so don't complain."
2,Cheap price = cheap tool,"I bought this product bc I had just started working with leather. It worked for about a month before the turning punch part got crooked & now the tool is useless. It is good for really thin leather but any thick leather, it doesn't even punch all the way through. Not recommended for serious leather working."
1,misaligned spikes after few uses,I have rarley used this but the alignment of the spikes with the punch base has shifted and thus it is of no use now.....very poor quality and no customer service to call to
4,Budget Leather Hole Punch Tool that Works,"I purchased this leather hole punch tool to add some additional holes to a triple-stitched bison leather belt that is approximately 1/8"" thick. The product works as advertised; however, the orange comfort grips are able to spin freely on the handles. I recommend punching the hole with the product, then keeping the handles pressed while rotating the unit side-to-side approximately 45-degrees to guarantee a clean cut.I had no problems with the unit successfully punching three new holes into my thick bison leather belt."
4,Leather punch,"Heavy duty enough for moderate use. Package is marked with hole diameters in inches but tool is marked in milimeters. So,you have to convert."
4,It worked,"I bought a new belt, but needed to add one more hole to fit me. Didn't want to pay $10 to get someone to punch a hole, so I decided to buy the hole puncher. The hole puncher came in a cheap packaging. The tool smelled and felt like it was submerged in oil. So I used a paper towel wrapped around the handles in holding the hole puncher. Adjusting the wheel (in selecting the size of the hole) was a little hard. Had to put some pressure and be careful not to pinch my finger. The tool worked fine however. I punched the hole with no problem. Then used it again to punch a hole in the leather band for my watch. Worked fine.It didn't come with instruction, but it was pretty easy to figure out how to use it. All in all, it worked as advertised."
3,"Leather Hole Punch Tool, Heavy Duty","Slightly defective but it does work. The anvil post is crooked. Since the punch does not meet the anvil squarely, you must turn the leather in the hole punch to get a clean, full circle cut."
3,"Heavy, tough to use.","Heavy, and tough to use. The rotator holes are not sharp enough to cut through genuine leather. have to really press hard to make a hole."
3,"Pretty interesting, but forgettable.","I'm not an expert on Hemingway and I haven't read more than just a couple of his books, but I thought this was a short, interesting book by one of Hemingway's sons, Gregory. He's not a writer and doesn't seem neither to try to become one nor to emulate his father's talents (although he tells us that he did try just both, when he was young). Instead, he gives more than a couple of interesting anecdotes. He puts some light on Hemingway's obsessions with his image and macho figure. At the time I read this book, a probably silly association came to my mind: Walt Whitman (another American hero from another age) and his supposed homosexuality -a complex statement that I, basicaly, disagree with. There're some aspects in Hemingway's postures in this book that made me think about his own unassumed conflicts with homosexual feelings and his image as a boxer and a 'viril' writer. Excellent pictures in the hard cover edition I've read."
1,"Seriously, Bandai!!!","I'd like to say before I start this, that I'm a major Digi-fan myself. I saw this at the Warehouse and tried it out, and I was gobsmacked! First of all, the phrases are totally un-Hawkmon-characteristic. And the voice! Bandai's gotta get the right voice actors if they want to make talking toys. I definitely gave this too many stars.All in all, if you're really a die-hard Digi-fan, PLEASE don't get this product, you'll be disappointed...."
5,Great for basics,"I learned to draw with Jon Gnagy and now I also use his basics for teaching my students in helping them to train their eyes and learn shading, perspective and to make things look dimensional."
1,Don't waste your time,This book has to be the worst book i've ever read. It was confusing and very boring. I have a lot of trouble seeing the number of epople that liked this book....what a waste of time.
1,bad book,WORST BOOK EVER....no joke. I have never written a review but feel it is my duty to do so to warn u of this terrible book.
3,"Exciting, but...","Sometimes I feel there are too many unnecessary details. I did see the movie based on this book. That was why I bought this book because somethings are missing in the movie. Oh well, I enjoyed reading anyway. Good book."
5,"A book fair in Moscow, begins it all","A struggling book publisher sets up an audio cassette booth at a Moscow publishers fair and the tale begins. A mysterious package to be taken back to London, which turns out to be full of Top Secret material. A superb plot and top notch production as must for all Le Carre fans Don Wardell"
4,Teaching history with graphic novels,"I was familiar with Mr. Lomax's work previously (Vietnam Journal) and when I found out this work was available, I wasted no time obtaining it. I was not disappointed. His use of a fictional character (""Journal"" Neithammer), mixed with factual events of the first Gulf War in 1991, made the book both compelling and quite readable. One of the problems that some may have is that the graphic novel is presented in black and white, and younger readers may find the comics (like film) as ""boring"" (I say this as I taught at a design college and the comment always irked me). I disagree. The basic B/W format forces the reader to read the text, as well as follow the story. My only critiques concerned a few minor things (Hussein being spelled a couple of ways, a lance corporal in the Army) but on the whole I enjoyed it."
5,Suspense of its best,"Swedish suspense are a hot item these days and arne dahl is one of the best, this is the first of a series and so far they are all good"
3,"Great for kids, but not sophisticated enough for adults","What I liked about this movie:interesting plot ideaWhat I didn't like about this movie:situations were too unbelievablecharacters were a little flat and stereotypicalthe girl kept getting them into trouble by her own stupidity, and the guy kept letting herSummary:a lot of kids and younger teens would probably like this movie because of the wild escapades and fast-paced plot, but viewers who like movies with realistic plots and multi-faceted characters will be disappointed"
5,Cute Movie.,"This made-for-TV Disney movie is really cute, but could have been better. I gave it 5 stars because I simply fell in love with Elizabeth Harnois (who plays the President's daughter). Should have been a big-budget boy-meets-girl type film from Disney."
4,Quite a bit of fun for a TV movie,"Will Friedle (""Boy Meets World""), Elisabeth Harnois, and Dabney Coleman star in this fun comedy adventure from The Wonderful World of Disney. When Duncan Fletcher (Friedle) is looking for a date to take to his high school dance as part of a bet with his friends, he stumbles upon Haley Richmond, who just happens to be ""the President...of our country"". What ensues is a string of encounters a la ""Adventures in Babysitting"" where Duncan and Haley ditch the Secret Service, find themselves in trouble with some street gangsters, and have a special night of fun during all the craziness. The young stars are up to the task here in this enjoyable film, which is able to avoid being a typical teen comedy. Dabney Coleman (as President) and Jay Thomas (as Duncan's father) also provide some laughs. The only thing that disappoints me is Disney has released this on VHS only. Too bad, because it would make a good DVD."
2,Paint It Gray.,"I really wanted to like this book. I saw A.E Hotchner on TV talking about Doris Day, and he just struck me as a likeable, earnest sort of guy. Unfortunately he didn't live up to his Tv-self in print. Most of the book is comprised of large chunks of interview material, both from Hotchner's own research and Rolling Stone magazine interviews you've probably already read. The rest is made up of highly subjective meanderings and vain attempts to link two ideas together.It's hard to make this story dull, and some of the Marianne Faithfull stuff is good, but there are better books with less academic-sounding titles about the same subject. Or you could just watch ""Gimme Shelter"" for the condensed version."
1,Lack of quality control,"I purchased the Humminbird 580 from Amazon and the NAVIONICS SD card for my region. When I received the Humminbird I opened the SD card slot panel and found out the card slot was never installed on the circuit board. I called Humminbird to confirm this model should have the card slot; then I called Amazon and after 15 minutes of explaining what the problem was to a person that had absolutely no technical background a new Humminbird 580 was on the way. Guess what? Your right, the replacement Humminbird was also missing the SD card slot. The serial numbers for the two were 26 unit apart. So I returned both to Amazon and received a prompt refund. Other then the problem communicating with the Amazon help line I am zero dollars out, Amazon paid for all the postage so thanks Amazon for taking care of a lousy product coming from Humminbird."
5,own this film,"44 starts moving fast and stays in your face right until the credits roll. i found myself compelled to the characters immediately and constantly surprised and affected by the decisions they made. definitely not for the faint of heart because although the movie is never gratuitously violent, it has some graphic scenes that made me wince and watch through my fingers.the most amazing part of the film is the 'usual-suspects' type ending that is so brilliant, you will immediately want to watch the movie again. keep an eye on these film makers, we'll be seeing a lot more of them."
5,Hot Stuff!,"If you like hot, this is hot. My wife used to buy this in a local store but it is no longer available. I checked on Amazon.com where I make most of my internet purchases and there it was. This stuff is GREAT!"
3,It's ok for a quick meal,"There is something, some taste that I remember, seems to be missing. Generally, it's good. Thanks."
2,"Nice ""Hotness"" to It, but It was Short on Flavor","Product had nice ""hotness"" to it, but it was short on flavor. Rather on the bland side. I would contrast this to some of the ""Kitchens of India"" products, where there's a nice ""hotness"" but massive flavor at well. I know it's apples/oranges, but just ""hot"" without the flavor of spices/layers-of-ingredients is not for my taste."
4,good,just bought nothing to complain about great price compared to other folding steps it might rust but it serves purpose well
5,Greatly practical guide,"This guide is exactly what a ""field"" guide should be: Compact and easy to carry on the field, a maximum number of varieties to identify, clear pictures and practical identifying points, with only basic, however pertinent infos about each plant. I just wish they would offer a French translation of that guide!"
3,"Great for identification, but no follow through","This book is very comprehensive at identification of plants, but not very informative on how to prepare or use the plants for medicinal purposes. I guess if you already knew how to prepare tinctures and when they were useful, for example, this book may be helpful. My search for a good book/books continues."
3,It's OK...,I WISHED IT WOULD HAVE MORE INFORMATION ON HERBS THAT GROW LOCALLY. OTHERWISE QUITE INFORMATIVE.
4,Great book!,I really like the color pictures although i wish they were bigger with more of them. But thats just my opinion and my eye sight is not what it used to be.
5,Great resource,Nice quality pictures with lots of information! Small enough to fit in purse or suitcase in case you want to travel with it. Pages are good quality and won't rip easily. I recommend this book for people who like to go wild-crafting or just looking for some plant knowledge.
3,Very easy to use but not exactly what I was looking for,Very good book good quality easy to read well organized but I am looking for somthing that's more focus on more commonly useable and usefull plants and details preparation. But it is probbabley the closest thing out there.
4,What I expected,My son and I really enjoyed looking through the pictures. I do not think you could have a book like this without really good pictures
4,Tons of info,A good guide. Lots of information. My wife loves it. I Recommend this for anyone interested in plants and herbs.
5,Way better than I had expected!,"This book is a great reference guide, and small enough that it can go in a cargo pocket(bit tall and bulky but it would fit). It is the most organized guide to medicinal plants that i've found so far, with an extensive index of symptoms. The pictures are a bit small, but are vibrant and descriptive enough. Loaded with vital information about allergies to certain plants and herbs, warnings of similar looking poisonous plants, and good sturdy pages that should last a long time.. even being beat up in the field. Well worth its money, buy one!"
5,"A beautiful, perfect book!","I was almost stunned with this book when I received and looked through it. It is something I should have purchased 50 yrs ago if possible! It is a beauitful, detailed, completely illustrated book which will make my walks more enjoyable and give me a better appreciation of Nature. I have many herb/plant books but nothing like this."
5,plant and herb guide,"Petersons plant and herb guide arrived in perfect condition. As in the usual Peterson guide style it is detailed yet easy to understand.Appreciate online availability, thank you.Speedy delivery!"
5,Field guide,loved this guide and plan on using it throughout the year. I love the clear colored pictures. They really help you recognize the plants so much better than sketches. Great information on every plant that it reviews. It is a small sized book for easy carrying. I great way to get information for plants in Eastern and Central United States.
4,well neened book,"The price was the frist thing. The pictures are clear, plainly written, easy to understand. This book can keep outdoor people safe.."
4,"Interesting, Small Print","I bought this for my grandmother in Georgia because she is always telling me about herbs and plants and I know she would learn some new information from this. My only concern is that the font is so tiny that she will probably have to use a magnifier to read it. If you are buying this for an elderly person, keep that in mind. Otherwise it looks great and seems to be packed full of information and photos."
2,Real Let Down,"First, I have to say, I bought this book from an Amazon.com seller,and am very satisfied with his customer service, my used book appeared to be new and he shipped faster than most amazon sellers do.Unfortunately, the book is less informative than the older versions of this book. It's very basic information, helps identify plants around the yard, but the pictures are often times not detailed enough, or they show a leaf or flower only when you need to see the whole plant in better detail."
1,earth song,"The author said the book was very funny, but I didn`t laugh even once. The story is not interesting and it`s not very compelling. I couldn`t finish reading the book. But I`m sure other people may view the book differently. This is just my opinion."
4,Good but not the best...,"Ok, let me start out by saying I love CC's work, she is almost my favorite, right behind Judith McNaught! I did enjoy this book, it was a little hard to get into after the first few pages, I like how the girl was so headstrong to do the things she did but it just took too long and there were too many intermediaries in the story. Warrior Song - the first of this series was really good, the best of the series, in my opinion. Earth Song was good, I will probably sell the book and not read it again, it didnt hold me that long for me to read again.Sorry Ms. Coulter, You are a wonderful writer but this one was a bit lacking. I guess we all have bad days."
4,Earth Song,"Coulter's best of the ""Song"" series! Plucky (what else?), statuesque heroine determined to be her own person and avoid an arranged marriage. With a case of mistaken identity and a family secret, the plot may be a bit predictable but that's what most of us expect from this tried and true genre. I found thehero a likeable rogue, the son delightful, and the a villain to hiss. Just expect an engrossing and well research ambience, and go along for a transporting journeyto another time with characters that you will love!"
4,Best of the series,"This one is the best of the ""Song"" series - the hero is not a rapist, the heroine isn't dumb, and the plot is actually a bit different from the others. Nice light reading - renews my faith a little in the author."
5,Loved it,She continues to maintain a high standard of fact and fiction. she mixes it all well together to create a world of fantasy.
3,Really funny book,"This book is definitely entertaining..The characters are strong and funny. The carefree hero who doesnt' like to be tied down ends up with more than he bargins for when he encounters the heroine.Although I was laughing throughout the book, I didn't feel like there was much romance development and I didn't feel the chemistry between the two main characters. As a couple, you just weren't drawn to them.But overall very entertaining."
4,Fun Read.,"I thought this book was a fun read. I loved the secondary characters and how the whole story unfolded and the many twists and turns it took along the way. Phillipa was a brave girl who had a giving heart and a fire in her spirit. This book was fun to read and kept me on my toes wondering what might come next. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of all the fighting between the two characters. I don't mind some fighting, but I don't like it when they are constantly going at it all the time. I just wished everyone didn't make fun of Phillipa's height. It got kind of mean and old after awhile. I believe there is a fine balance and this one just tipped a little too far over to the hostility side. But, don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed this book. There were some real funny and cute parts in it (i.e.my favorite was the mud scene)."
5,I LOVED THIS BOOK~!!!,This was the first book of Catherine Coulter's that I ever read.. And it was the best~!! I've read this book over 10 times~!!! It's one of those books you just have to re-read over and over again~!!
2,Not what I had hoped,"I purchased this to do reading exercises with children at school. Even with the ""Clear Voice Recording"" feature, it fails to record well unless I use an outboard microphone.Sony products have been good to me in the past, but this one does not perform as it should."
1,"very, very disapointed","At one time ""Sony"" had a very good reputation for quality products.This cassette recorder was anything but a quality product (mechanically,everything worked just fine). Sound reproduction was abysmal -- far worsethan poor! A very loud ""hissss"" overrode the recording -- even when I usedan external microphone. I did not expect a 4track recorder, but what Igot should be an embarrassment to any manufacturer. Shame on you SONY!!PC Taylor"
2,Sony Recorder,I refuse to review the item since I received an item that had been returned to the seller. I was under the impression that since I paid the full price listed I would be receiving a new item.
5,A Must Read for Parents,"This book is an eye-opener. It will open your eyes to the abuse of power that exists in many states. Money talks, and the authors of this book demonstrate how power is abused by state agencies. Unfortunately, in spite of this well written book, the abuses of power still exist.If you are a parent, read this book! You may not be able to change the corrupt system, but you'll at least know what to protect yourselves against, and how to better protect your children."
3,"Worthwhile content, Overblown package","I ordered this book by mail at a reduced price. When it arrived, I thought it was an overblown production: i.e. full color bleed spreads in 1 background color with perhaps 27 words on them; serrated tear out sheets of stuff similar to what you might tear out of magazines and catalogs. However, since I bought it, I read it. The author has developed a method of getting at what a company wants or needs in graphic design for corporate materials. I think it would suitable as a workbook for a one-day or weekend seminar in design."
1,Barely a 1 star,I wish I could give this product a negative rating. I recieved the first one in the mail it failed after I downloaded songs onto the player. Sent it back and recieved a second MP3 player that ceased right before I was going to use it at the gym.
1,it doesnt work what do i do,it loads music but does not play it. The music woould work if not for the sound card it destorts the sound.
4,Excellent account of early years of Supply-Side Revolution,"I read this book because I was studying the economic changes brought about by the Reagan victory in 1980. I've seen many favorable and unfavorable mentions of the ""supply-side"" theory, so I was looking for an account from a true supply-sider. This book fits that need. It desribes the immediate intellectual origins of the policy (but not the fundamental long-term origins). It then describes the political battles that went on in the legislative and executive branches from 1978 to about the end of 1981. I enjoyed reading how the free-market Republicans, Keynesian Republicans and liberals fought it out behind the scenes. These battles shaped the relatively vague ""supply-side"" theory into a specific government policy. This book is a good view into those years and provides perspective to the more recent government tax and spending issues."
2,A version with less passion,"I used to listen this concertos from the version of Murray Perahia and the English Chamber Orchestra. The version of Barenboim is too slowly and without the ""passion"" I felt from Perahia."
4,A real time saver,"I purchased a few of the small shingle removers for my guys and they all love it. It's a great tool for hard to reach places such as hips, valleys, dormers, and it really works great for removing the flashing from around chimneys. We've done a number of strip jobs useing this tool and have had no problems at all. If you use the tool the way it's intended to be used and not as a pry bar it works great. I highly recomend it. It really makes a tough job allot easier."
1,Chinese garbage,"I just got my Qual-Craft shingle remover and tried it for the first time today. One would think that the name should imply quality, but it certainly does not.We were removing cedar shingles and, after removing less than two square, gave up on using this tool. The problem is that this Chinese-made tool is constructed of such soft metal that we were constantly having to bend it back into shape.In all fairness, the design of this tool is good if they would make it out of the same steel as pry bars are made of. But, until they do, don't waste your money on buying this product. I wish I hadn't. It's little more than Chinese garbage."
3,shorter than expected,I should have read the description more carefully. The shingle shovels were about knee high. I would have prefered a more traditional shovel handle length.
5,It's Great!,"This book is one of the best by Anna Riva. It focuses on everyday Useful spells that an modern witch can use. The book's practical and easy to understand instructions makes it an excellent guide to beginners and experience witches alike.Putting the ""evil"" spells aside, this work is as good, if not better, than Anna Riva's other book, SPELLCRAFT, HEXCRAFT and WITCHCRAFT...It's a must buy!"
3,somewhat helpfull,"I started to practice over 13 yrs ago this was one of my 1st books purchased.When I became a practicioner I LOVED THIS BOOK! BUT, after a few years the book seemed to be less ""useful"" to me. Yes the spells are great and YES THEY DO WORK, aha! But you have to KEEP WORKING THEM over a period of time! I'm sorry I'm just used to getting things done and not having to repeat them over & over again! But I will say that the Prosperity Ritual and the LovE ritual are GOOD for beginners.But you may get more out of the use of herbs at the back of the book more than anything. I found this book to be very knowledgeable at 1st, but after I became a more seasoned and trained worker, it was just added to my library shelf. But it does have a good time table for planetary hours."
3,Widescreen does not work for me,I have a 32 inch TV and the aspect ratio for this movie on this size screen is just silly. There must be 8 inches of black on top and bottom of the picture. Although it does maintian the original scope of the movie it is not pleasant to watch a foot of movie when the VHS version is full screen. Although the DVD has some neat toys this movie needs to be seen large. A 1.85 to1 ratio would have been OK but a dual format release was the real ticket. Buy the video in December
3,overrated,"Well-done; but not nearly as good as most people think it is. The whole virtual reality/reality angle isn't particularly new, or even presented freshly, but since most people aren't acquainted with science fiction that well they're impressed. The acting is horrible; I wouldn't expect much from the male lead, but even the other actors, some of who have showed talent elsewhere give wooden performances. The movie is put together well, and while the art direction is the usual Ridley Scott/H.R. Giger ripoff it's at least done professionally. The action scenes are well-choreographed, though I've seen a lot better. All in all a decent movie."
5,THE GREATEST MOVIE!,"This movie has great special effects and a great plot and great music and great acting. I love this movie. The video has a 26 minute behind the scenes look at it, too. A great movie!"
4,"A different look at ""reality""","The Matrix is a thought-provoking, innovative film that causes its audience to question what is truly real around them. Keanu Reeves, who plays an introverted computer software programmer/hacker, is thrown into a world where he is shown that the world in which he has lived his whole life is nothing more than a bunch of ""ones and zeros"", or binary digits compiled by evil agents to create a program that is our world. This film was very well done, with amazing special effects. It includes many technological wonders, such as interactive virtual reality programs, telephones that connect two worlds, and programs that can be downloaded into one's memory. A real thriller and must-see."
4,The MATRIX rocks!,"The Matrix is a non-stop trip through cyberspace. The story is top notch,the acting suffers a little,but can be overlooked.If you want a non stop Mind F**k look no further than the MATRIX."
5,What a Movie!!,"Wow, what a movie. The effects are unbelieveable, the story is great but a little confusing, but overall it is one of the best movies I have ever seen. The widescreen isnt that small, so you can actually see the movie. The special features in the movie are ok which include follow the white rabbit. Follow the White Rabbit comes up at the bottom of the screen, you press enter, and they will show you how they shot that scene. I like this special feature the best. The acting is also great in this movie. I hope to see more movies like this one in the future."
2,There's better sci-fi out there,"The Matrix is pure fluff with some style. Granted, the special effects were great, but the plot loopholes are just too much to take. For instance, why do supposed "" freedom fighters "" kill innocent human SWAT members? How can Keannu destroy an entire office floor and hit everything except a sitting-still Fishburne? Why would a computer create "" agents "" and give them less than perfect aim? The plot is nothing new and occasionally lapses into gibberish. It's a shame that people are calling this the future of sci-fi. If you ask me, I would much rather watch good sci-fi like 2001 and Alien. Do yourselves a favor and watch a show like The Outer Limits for better sci-fi on a way smaller budget."
3,Not the aspect ratio I was expecting,"It is the regular 2.35:1 movie. I don't know why it was listed as 1.66:1I really wanted a version of the movie that would fill up my screen :(Otherwise it's ""The Matrix"" and you can't go wrong with this movie."
3,Matrix 10th anniversary Blu-Ray,"Obviously, this is a great movie for special effects. The biggest upset was seeing a noticeable difference between the basic DVD and the Blu-Ray version. Neither the sound or video made me go ""Wow, what a difference"". I would recommend this movie to any who don't already own a copy...it's a must own in that respect!"
1,"This could have been a good movie, but.","Me and my three sisters went to see this movie on labor day and the only thing good about it was the special effects. It could have been good were it not for that thing about using the telephone booth to go back to their home base. What was that all about? It threw the whole thing off and made it seem ridiculous. I did like Kenau in it, however."
5,Awesome,This the best DVD ever! I have to say I have never seen such a movie. Anyone who is thinking about getting this really should get this.
2,don't be a sheep,"this movie is fun to watch, but so many people devote their lives to proclaiming how great it is, the script is weak, and and the stylizing is bleak, boring and cliche, but the action seens are very well done, i just wish they where in a different movie and with a story that did have so many loose ends, but you will probably love it"
2,Extremely overrated,clearly overrated and totally unoriginalit's just a mixture of william gibson's neuromancer (william first introduced us to the matrix.. almost ripoff warning here) Ghost in the Shell and Dark City + some hong kong martial artsand so there are uncountable holes in the ploti give it a little credit for the special effects and i can't deny i enjoyed watching it.. but i demand much more than that from a film
1,Won't play in some players (including mine),"I saw the matrix at the theater and thought it was one of the best SF movies I had seen. I was overjoyed when I found out it was coming out on dvd. I went and bought it the day that it came out, took it home and poppedit ininto my player. It will not load up. After exchanging it twice I gave up. it seems that a lot of people have been experincing the same problems. I have a ge player and have heard of troubles with it on samsung, pioneer, and some sony players also. Check out the web for any troubles with your player before buying it."
1,One of the Worst movies ever!,Yes the matrix has great special effects wow! That does not make the movie and either does ripping off Japan/China martial arts films. The basis of the story was good but the acting stunk and how about the costumes. If I were trying to keep a low profile I would not be out wearin all black leather and drive a pimed out continential. It also contained some scenes that were totally irrelivent to the movie i.e the scene with the oracle?? Was the head men in black supposed to be funny? This movie is a perfect example of where movies are going and it looks grim!
1,WHUT WAS THIS?,"Honestly I hated this movie because Kenu was much better in Bill and Ted, I know this guy can do a LOT better! The digital efx seemed kinda fake (I've even seen better ones on some music videos on MTV...)The story was MADE for wanna be intelletualish pranks! And for all of you mega fans (specially the ones that compare Matrix to Star Wars) that are gonna bash this review with negative rating please take out Eraserhead and learn!"
4,"Lot of fighting, fashion, flair, flaws","This movie has basic flaws in its premise, but if you overlook them (or don't notice them, like most people) there's a lot of great action and style. The DVD version is great, with cool menus, extras, etc."
3,Little More than Run-and-Gun Special FX,"the Matrix fell quite short of my expectations, it is painfully cliche, theres a good guy and a bad guy, the good guy fights some crucial battle with the bad guy and wins of course, been there, seen that, its way too predictable. The story has little depth and just comes down to shootouts full of special fx, only some one with the taste of a 7year old would call this good movie making, there is no character development, no depth, nothing but guns and explosions. Keanu Reeves takes the tiring ""act as little as possible"" routine to a new level, as do the rest of the cast. So bottom line: you can go here just for the special fx but it aint worth seeing again due to a total lack of decent acting and a good story line"
5,MORE THAN AN ACTION FLICK,"If you choose this movie hoping to see non-stop action, you might be a little disappointed. While The Matrix boasts a number of shoot-'em-up, kick-'em'-in-the-head battle scenes further illuminated by the next wave in special effect technology, this movie also a number of thought-provoking questions as to the nature and existence of reality itself.The action gives the film its blockbuster appeal, but the meat of the story lies in the philosophy behind it. I read in the newspaper that a college somewhere in the eastern U.S. taught a class about The Matrix's philosophy on reality. If you're not looking for something that will challenge your own world view, this movie's not for you.But if you want something that both makes your heart race and the wheels of your mind turn, accept no substitute. The Matrix has no equal."
4,I am an FBI agent!,"Once again Keanu puts on another performance worthy of Bill and Ted's excellent adventure, and Point Break, but this film has some unbelievable effects and a story that keeps you semi alert. Worth taking a look at, if nothing else just for Keanu's crazy antics."
5,"Keanu Reeve is fantastic, effects, effects and more effects","The Matrix is a fantastic film, it has plenty of special effects,action and Keanu Reeves."
3,"Good, but stick to the Original","This a descent movie, and one of the few ""remakes"" that actually gives the original a run for its money. This movie is obviously based on ""Dark City."" ""The Matrix"" has more special effects than ""Dark City,"" but the plot is basically the same. A man learns that the life he has known is a farce and that the entire world is being run by a higher sentenance. As he learns more and more about the world, he is being hunted by those that want to keep the status quo.While ""The Matrix"" stands on its own two legs, so to speak, the legs are different than the original. ""The Matrix"" leans heavily on spectacular effects and a decent plot, ""Dark City"" relies on strong acting and plotline. ""The Matrix"" is a great movie that you don't have to think very hard to follow, and ""Dark City"" is a superb movie you have to pay close attention to in order to follow. I recommend both with ""Dark City ranked as a ""5."""
2,Not the greatest film I ever saw,The Matrix - great special effects - one hell of a lousy movie. The movie just tended to be rather dull without all the action. Their attempts at making what the Matrix really is about is rather dull and heavy handed. Other than that the film was high on action but not enough on classIncidentally I thought Fight Club was a better movie - had more humour in it
3,fig chump loot rest naught,"it's okay. good for the special effects.sci-fi, action, slightly suspense/drama/romance/mystery.so keanu is like, this hacker dude, and he does stuff, and he gets in trouble, like, but he doesn't know what he's dealing with. but there are some totally awesome special effects which are worth watching for their music-video-quality of style, innovation, techno-fruit.and of course it's kinda nice to watch from a 'i wish i could do that' kind of perspective. the concept is definitely sweet. ahh, to be inside a computer. to be hyperreflex supertalented and inside a computer. to be wearing such nice pvc outfits. ahhh.i didn't buy it and i wouldn't have...someone else put me on the spot in a DVD store and said 'ok which one do you want' and i liked everything else there less. so i got the matrix.it's nice here and there."
3,Good. But certainly no the best movie ever,"The first time I saw this movie I really liked it. The only aspects i didn't enjoy were the action scenes. The Film Industry has been making a good fortune with heroes that kill sixty men with a 15 bullets gun without any reloading. If this movie didn't have all those action scenes, it would be better. But... The storyline was good, but I have read better. But anyway, if you want to read about the future of AI and robotics, I recomend you to read ""The Age of Spiritual Machines"" by Ray Kurzweil and ""Robot"" by Hans Moravec. These aren't any novels, they are expeculations about the future, but, read them with some skepticism. Also, I recomend you to look for any info concerning Transhumanism. Many of Transhumanism's ideas were filtered in this movie. Overal, buy it if yoiu liked it. But remember, it isn't the best movie of all time. You really want a movie with computers and complexities? I recomend you to see Pi."
2,I have had a problem with the DVD,"I recieved the DVD, I tried to play it on 6 different players and it did not work at all. Reason why I give 2 stars is because of the customer service I recieved when I called, right away they were able to next day the movie to me and it accually works!"
3,sorry about the violence,"The Matrix is one tough film and it had the foundation (Act 1 and 2 )to blow you away. However Act 3 falls short with the same old solutions of violence and fear. ""Dark City"" takes us to another level and Matrix could have gone to another level far beyond but did not. I look forward to seeing more from the minds of these directors. It is a great film and they will only get better."
5,It blew my socks off!,"After waiting for what feels like forever for this movie to open in Swedish theatres I managed to get a ticket for the opening night. I must say that I was kinda sceptic at first since Keanu Reeves was the leading actor, and I have seen many movies that he has totaly destroyed with his acting, and it almost seemed as if he was going to destroy this one aswell. But then the twist of the movie kicks in. He is the only actor that could do the part of Neo convincing. He acts kinda stupid and slow as always, but the thing is that it works. (You have to see the film to know what I am talking about) The FX in the movie are awsome. This alone is a very good reason to go see the movie. My recomendation is to see it on a big screen first."
4,"If bullet time doesn't blow you away, the software will...","My wife and I saw it in the movie theater and wanted to see it again. A sci fi thriller to say the least. The effects are state of the art. The software is intense too. The production release I own, makes my early model DVD fail (freeze or lock up) in three different scenes. This material is notorious as an MPEG buster. If your DVD player can't play this movie end to end without stoping, then it might be time for a software (or hardware) upgade for that clunky old DVD player. The fight scenes aren't the only thing that can deliver a death blow. My wife always wanted to see what Keanu Reeves would look like clean shaven and dipped in goo. Way too many bullets for young kids."
5,inspirational,"This is one of the few movies that I have watched more than once...I'm watching it for the 8th time tonight. A great movie should be inspirational, but can't be too phony. As human beings we all have hope that there is a better life even amongst the frailty of our weaknesses and the squalor of our existence. This is a unique approach, a believable fantasy that good conquers evil and that love conquers all."
4,a little far fetched but excellent special effects.,"This film will appeal to the 13 to 35 age group with special effects stunningly created to appease the sci-fi crowd and a storyline revolving around computer programs. Keanu Reeves' drone acting pales in comparison to Laurence Fishburne's articulate delivery but the two of them have the right chemistry ,in a clashing type of way. A very well directed and choregraphed film. its nice to see an attempt at sci-fi without the force being with you. Original ideas are rare in a film industry saturated with sequels, retreads, remakes and copycats. Superb photography. A job well done to all involved in the making of this picture......."
5,THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE!!!!,"The Matrix is by far the most fantastic sci-fi epic I have ever seen in my whole life!! It far supercedes any of the other competition in the same genre by spreading new horizons within the chapter of great filmmaking as well as state-of-the-art special effects. Great chemistry between Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne...trippy storyline...hot chick that Carrie-Anne Moss! What a babe!! There are rumors that a sequel might be coming out?? I'm there the day it comes out, baby!!"
3,"read the book ""the futurological congress"" of stanislav lem","i think the matrix is not as good as everyone says. there are many unlogical things in the plot. what's the reason why the computers generate an artifical world for their ""humanbodyslaves""? why they don't keep the bodys alive without any brain activity? they would have less problems..."
2,The Chosen One!!,"Keanu Reeves plays an ordinary guy who is supposed to be the next savior of humanity. Sounds corny doesn't it, but his movie actually takes itself very seriously. 'The Matrix' goes around preaching Eastern philosophy like it was its own original idea. This was one of the worst lines; 'Maybe its not the spoon that is bending but your mind!!' Whoa, such profound dialogue. Too bad it was thought up 3000 years ago!! Later on in the film a woman falls in love with Keanu because it was said she would fall in love with the CHOSEN ONE. There are plenty of action sequences that go on forever; the worst is when the robots, who are supposed to be flawless, can't shoot the weak human beings. Then at the end of the film there is some Rage Against The Machine music, just so the teenagers won't fall a sleep."
5,The Matrix,This is probably this science fiction movie I have seen. It has excelent special affects and realy makes you think
5,follow the white rabbit,"story and action set this one a masterpiece of sci-fi galore, Neo(played by the suave Keanu Reeves) enters the matrix and learns hes part of a computer program and the real world is controlled by Zion and there are sentinels who find ships and destroy them, all along there is a evil Agent Smith trying to hack out of the system and try to conquer Zion. pure pulasating rock music and fight sequences blend together to make a grand stand of a movie. one of the best of 1999"
2,It's the cheesiest!,"What is this? Wanna-be Hong Kong movie + wanna-be Western movie + Wanna-be SF? I felt kinda sorry for all the money that spent on that movie. Yes, the special effects and all that but nothing impressive. But if you liked it, then go to watch ""The Cell"". You'll probably like it, too."
5,THE BEST I REPEAT BEST MOVIE EVER MADE AND EVER TO BE MADE,"THE MATRIX , MOVIE,SOUNDTRACK,POSTERS EVRYTHING A BOUT IT KICKS ASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS"
1,Puerile,"If you are 12 years old or below in intellectual age then this film will be your cup of tea. It had all of the makings of the ""New Hollywood"" classic:slow motion explosions; Kung-Fu kicking galore; small arms fire aplenty; idiotic, trite dialog; politically correct of course ; much noise but little thought;Better yet, get the comic book."
1,Cannot Believe it!!!!,"I bought the DVD, after seeing the movie in the theater. I got about half way through the movie and it started to lose tracking and got all messed up. I called customer support at Amazon, and they informed me that there was a problem with this particular DVD on certain DVD players. The manufacturer is aware of this but refuses to fix it. So please beware that this DVD may not work on your DVD player, so check before you waste your time ordering it. Good luck to those who purchase it, hopefully you will have better luck than I did."
1,"VR, CG experience I (sadly) won't forget..........","The Matrix was a waste of my time. I could have spent the money on something useful. The acting, trite and sometimes melodramatic, did not help things at all. The special effects, sadly, are the only high points in this film. Judging by the trailers and teasers, I thought we were in for a treat and that this was going to be the kind of movie that defines a decade, the kind we'll be telling our grandchildren about. I was sorely mistaken. I always enjoy a good story, but this is one place I looked and failed to find one. The script was filled with trite remarks and predictable dialogue. This movie was basically nothing but a very expensive cut-and-paste job, blatantly stealing ideas from predecessors -- I found many John Woo, Ghost In The Shell, and Akira ideas here, among others. Is this cutting edge? Is this the best they could do? I hope not. Find something better to do with your time."
2,This movie is a bad joke.,"The film has a very interesting philosophic idea, and the plot is indeed unpredictable. But the movie itself is too bad. The main idea was well developed but it was not entirely original. It was taken from Total Recall and The Nightmare on Elm Street. And it was also unreasonably violent. All people around there were enemies. It was ok for the main hero to enter the federal building and start killing everyone he sees. What this movie teaches our children and us? The plot has too many holes. Why, for example, people have to die in reality if they were killed just in the dream? There was nothing great or special in the special effects. The actions were intense but still too primitive. Characters were not well developed. Bad acting. I was disappointed with this movie. It does not worth watching even once."
1,Very Displeased,"The Matrix is by far My favorite movie of all time! I went out and bought the dvd the day it came out. However when I got it home to play it the size of the screen appalled me. I was watching a tiny little rectangle and my tv is not that small it's a 36"" tv. But tvs are square for the most part and to make the screen size so small it gives me a headache to watch it. How hard would it be to release these movies in both formats and give people the choice it's not fair! For those of you who love this movie as much as I do, don't waist your money on the dvd buy it on video at least you get a full picture!"
4,ALMOST the prefect DVD,"The worst audio commentary of all time does not affect this fantastic movie. This is one of the best DVD's available, just make sure to stay well clear of that awful commentary."
2,very poor dvd quality,"even if the movie was fun watching, the digital transfer on dvd was very poor. the flesh tones were very yellow even after calibrating the tv with video essentials dvd."
3,A great idea is not enough,"Once more... I knew it before seing it. The theme is great, even if not totally original. The FX are nice, certainly impressive for addicted to the genre. At the end of the day, I was feeling embarassed for the director during scenes like this ridiculous fight between the columns of the bad guys' HQ. Too bad. I really was captured by the first minutes. But there is no depth in the following. The actors are good. The scenario is pitiful. However, see it just to imagine what if could have been - maybe a kind of 2001 Space Odyssey in its own genre!"
1,"Amazon did not print my first review, so here it is again.","I hate this movie, I don't care what people say. The acting is so horrible, I felt like I was watching public access. The special effects were used a little too much. This movie lacks in quality the way all the other special effects filled movies do. Like twister and speed, this movie is horrible, beginning to end. I cannot explain how bad this movie is, so, if you really know what a good movie is, do not get this one, you will be disappointed."
1,FX movie with no plot,"Theres no denieing the fact that somebody came up with a few new speichel effects and decided to quickly rush them into a movie. Apart from the effects which have been copeied and done to death so many times since this movie, this movie has absolutly no plot, no intrest, no point, and if this movie did not have the SFX shots that it does, no body would even have known what this movie was, except for the Keenu Reeve fans.Purchase all 3 if you want to see some stunning visual FX but all based around a completly pointless, or, IF ANY plot at all. If the movie had plot ideas, it could have been somthing, but its highly given credit to, when every one cant denie its just the SFX that people are stunned by, not the plot.... watch the intro to that Olsen twins show if you wanna see the SFX from this movie!Bottem line; Take away the FX, you have a bad movie!"
1,Over-rated!,"Keanu Reeves is hands down the worst thing going. How this guy managed to become an A-list actor is beyond me. Sure the effects look good, but 10 years from now this flick will look cheesy and dated. Matrix is this generation's ""Tron""."
3,"It beats Virus and Episode 1, but does that say anything?","For the Sci-Fi's of '99 go, The Matrix was the best. It's competitors being Virus and Episode 1, says nothing for the film anyway. It has some cool sequences, but not enough to fulfill the shoes as such classics as Aliens and Terminator 2: Judgement Day did. It deserves an award for CGI effects, but thats not to say the films great or anything. It's hurt by overlongness, slowness and overall confusion beyong being creative. Don't buy it unless you really, really loved it. I didn't."
5,The best movie in a long ass time...,This is now my favorite movie. I loved the plot and the special affects. I make everyone I know watch and most of them love it too
5,AWESOME MOVIE!,"On many levels, this movie was a truly spiritual event. That, on top of great action, special F/X, & wonderful plot. It was a mind, body and soul trip! This movie left me with a feeling that maybe, in a way, I TOO can fly. Sure, it was pure special effects, Hollywood pat, been done before, etc., but you know there IS nothing new under the sun. So any movie that can make it fresh-like-new-never-seen-it-put-like-THAT-before! is pure delight for me. It's one of the few movies I can revisit with the fondness that is usually reserved for a favorite book. A book that doesn't need to be critically acclaimed, Pulitzer prize winning caliber, true to life, etc. but a book that touches me on a purely personal level -- one that never fails to give me something for my time when I'm done."
5,I greatly enjoyed this movie.,I paid to see this THREE times in the theatre. I thoroughly enjoyed watching it and recommend this action packed thriller to any sci-fi fan.
4,killer movie,"The Matrix is one of those movies that defines what DVD is all about - incredible action and sound, not to mention a pretty good story line and direction. The Matrix gets a spot in the home DVD library because you can watch it over and over."
5,Great...,"Well, apparently you know what the movie is about, so I'll not dwell on that. But what strikes me is that's how a movie becomes a classic: it has style (great music and direction), intrigue, pathos and even a drop of love-story and, what's more, all together it makes sense and makes you think afterwards, what is unusual! Modern technology and special effects are used to enhance the plot, not to replace it (like in laughable, childish Phantome Menace, Ep. 1). Even Mr. Reeves, whose career soared after some time spent in oblivion, deserves highest merit (of course, apart from the scenes when his head is shaved...)"
5,Science fiction anyone can love!,"Even if you're not a staunch sci-fi fan, oh, GOD, have you got to see the Matrix! You'll have to see it twice! I'm hooked...it makes you THINK about things you can't imagine any human being ever fantasizing before. Just see it, it's beyond words."
2,Keanu Reeves proves to be on eof the most over rated actors,"First of all the Wachowski brothers first film BOUND was much better. I could dig what the Matrix was trying to say...it is basically the same story of Plato's Allegory of the Cave...but i thought overall it was rubbish. the directing was great, at first, but after seeing the rotating camera shot for the 10th time i was quite fed up. Keanu Reeves as always is a ridiculous actor. overall i would not recommend this movie. Watch BOUND!"
4,awesome movie with awesome features,"ok, so everybody said ""this movie would suck without special effects."" well that's just the point. Nobody ever said the matrix was a dialogue filled intellectual feast. However, for anyone who is a fan of great filmaking, this movie is a must see. the matrix contains some of the greatest camerawork, cinematography, and audacious angles in movie history. The experience is made even better on DVD with the digital quality picture and sound, and the huge array of features only on the DVD. Especially cool is the running commentary from those who made the film in one feature, and the inclusion of the ""making of"" documentary. Its interesting to see just how the amazing visuals of the film were pulled off. All in all, a good waste of 20 bucks ;-)."
5,The Matrix is the BEST movie i've ever seen!,"The Matrix has it all: action, good acting, awesome special effects, good storyline, etc... I bought this movie on VCD and i'm gonna buy it on DVD when it comes out! Its a definite buy. If you haven't seen it, watch it the first chance you get. I'm sure you won't be disappointed."
5,The best action/sci-fi movie ever made.,What can I say except that I cannot wait to see what they do with the sequel.
4,hidden message,The message is hidden so deep.It's too hard to understand it.People just see the amazing pictures.But the real idea is failed to be deliverd.
5,It stands out.,"It does indeed. It's not an Oscar drama film nor was it ever supposed to be, so play down this argument if you ever happen to hear one. Most likely, however, you'll hear compliments to the creators for a really outstanding job, for creating what has been considered by many as ""the ultimate sci/fi movie"" before, but that sadly could hardly be ever seen. You know what a good movie should be like, you can feel it, but all movies that intend to be it usually fail and only few get to achieve this state of near perfection. These few are remembered and referenced for a very long time and Matrix is one such movie in its genre. Chances of you liking it? - 99%, leaving that 1% for somewhat twisted people who like that nobody likes and hate what everyone likes."
4,Cyberspace will never be the same.,"To sum it up: Not what it was all dressed up to be. It was better. This thought-provoking theater explosion features a plot like no other, but is sometimes a throwback to old horror movies in their approach. You'll find special effects that never end, and hundred of people being riddled with bullets in the last half-hour, which is basically the whole movie. Like George Lucas' Star Wars movies, it keeps you waiting until the very end to see the most breathtaking action. Be prepared though; if you couldn't handle James Bond, this one will knife you in the head. A must-see for every teenager!"
4,"Coppertopped, but not quite Duracel","The true test of any movie is how it fairs after you have watched it several times - and on this count ""The Matrix"" just doesnt have the necessary staying power to make it an enduring Sci-fi classic. This is a shame, as Larry Fishburne's performance as Techno-sage Morpheus is truly mesmeric, a kind of Kung Fu Obi Wan Kenobi sans light-sabre. Its Reeves' lifeless (yet accurate?) potrayal of a Hacker which does the most damage to the film, but the blatant disregard for the laws of physics at the start of the film before the viewer is made aware that this isn't the 'real' world but is a computer-generated one could also put some people off. But hey, its not all bad news as the action scenes are eminently watchable, and any film that can succeed in making hacking/hackers look interesting must have something going for it."
4,What can I say? It's the Matrix,"I do not agree with the violent content in this movie. However the special effects were off the hook. When I first went to go see this movie I didn't know what to expect. Everything was a surprise. They didn't give away anything in the previews.Which is good. this is where most movies fail. I found myself still talking about this movie a month after I saw it. I couldn't get it out of my mind. I've never seen a movie like it in my life. I'm still unclear of what the matrix is because I think It's more complex than a simple definition.The only bad thing about the movie is that the violence should of been replaced by martial arts. then it would of been hype. However, the people in Hollywood can't stop the urge to just shoot things up. They glamourized guns in this movie. And I saw kids in the movie theatre! It could of had 5 stars if it wasn't so violent."
5,Awesome flick!,This movie caught me by surprise when I first saw it. I was not expecting it to be as good as it is. It is the best flick of '99 by far. It is MUCH better than phantom menace (unless you are around 12 years old)
4,Very entertaining,"Enjoyed it. Lots of action and cool effects, and suspenseful too. Even years after it came out I enjoyed it."
5,Iconic,"This movie has entered contemporary culture and is likely to remain. It has classic elements of action, adventure, romance, with the over-arching theme of Good-vs-Evil. And it's technologically brilliant. It works on *so* many levels."
2,Digital Copy didn't work,"The video is excellent, the audio is excellent, but thing that bothered me was the fact that the digital copy of the movie that was included was a bust. I entered the code and it told me that it was invalid, and that codes can only be used once. Someone has already redeemed my code? Bogus! I went to the support page, and there's a drop down list of Blu-rays that you can ask for help on, and none of them were for The Matrix. So I can't even ask for help. Thanks to whomever sold me a code that was invalid or already redeemed."
2,Honest Dissent,"I almost gave this movie three stars, but I just can't. Kudos to the filmmakers for having a little more imagination than most who attempt to bring science fiction to the screen, but to me this movie was stupid to the core, and all the balletic violence and the beautiful slow-motion fall of thousands of shell casings can't make up for the stupidity. From the absurd notion that human bodies are power sources (just ask a physicist to estimate the thermodynamic efficiency of human metabolic processes) to the Deus Ex Machina resolution (Keanu as Messiah - ""He's the one!""), the noise and banality overwhelms what is original in this film. It is a visual feast, and the Oracle as cookie-baking Mom was fun, but I think this film is highly overrated."
3,Great special effects battle a confused and muddled script,"An interesting idea for a movie, with dazzling special effects, degenerates as quickly as possible to a tedious barrage of noise and action movie cliches for those with short attention spans. It's as if the script writers have fallen asleep while this work was in process. But not the special effects people and artists. The visuals do a good job of distracting you from how lame, one-sided, inconsistant, and un-inspired the story really is. Finally, in the last five minutes, the movie completely falls appart, making no attempt at logic whatsoever, leaving you with countless unanswered questions. The very last scene is incongruous to the rest of the movie. If a sequel is made, let's hope it's more consistant and thoughtful than this one. You could do a lot worse than the Matrix, but it failed to live up to it's hype."
3,What is the Matrix? One awesome DVD,"A truly awesome AC3 experience... I recommend it to any sci-fi buff who dosen't mind a little mind bending... The only really good Keaneu Reeves film to date... The story was great, the soundtrack was good, etc. Not one of the greats, but definately above average."
3,Could have been great,"I love the first half of this movie. It's great scifi: stylish and mind-boggling. Then it stops being great scifi, and we get an hour of overlong, unoriginal but hip action-scenes. I mean, there's nothing wrong with hip, futuristic action-scenes, but they're out of place here. Without the weird special effects it would be just like any other action movie - even the dialogue is similar. ""I'm going in."" ""I'm coming with you."" ""No you're not."" ""Yes I am."" The second half is even worse considering what a really great story it had to build on. What were they thinking?"
3,it's good... but come on! it's NOT all that!,"ok, ok... i admit it... it's a good movie. but all those of you out there who think that this is the best move ever... get your head out of the clouds! it has great action scenes, but that's about it! this movie is way, way, way too long and there aren't nearly as many action scenes as it would need to be a great movie. and let's face it... keanu reeves can't possibly carry a movie as its leading man. i think its an ok movie, but only if you are willing to put in the endless hours to watch it."
5,"Without a doubt, the best SCI-FI film of the decade.","A rare treat in recent science fiction/action films. This movie contains a well-written script, expertly acted and beautifully filmed. It's also chock-full of eye candy, as well as the smallest sunglasses manufactured today. :)"
5,THE BEST MOVIE,"this is the best movie there is,and probably ever will be.(except for maybe the sequel)This movie is pure genious!I had to watch Matrix more than 2 times before i understood it, but now that i do it is auwsome!I watched blade,thinking it would rival MAtrix,but it didnt live up to my expectations because of minor flaws.Go out now and watch and or rent this movie!"
2,Where the heck is the action scenes?,"I watched this movie on the cinema and then I bought it on DVD. The first thing I wanted to see again on the DVD was the shootout when he hides behind the walls in a building and he spins in the air and shoots the enemys at the same time. But, where can I find the scene?which time on the counter? I havn't found it yet."
2,Bad Choice of Seller,I purchased the movie to use for my senior English classes (lesson comparing it to A Brave New World) and it skipped horribly throughout the entire movie. It was incredibly distracting to the students and basically ruined three days of lesson plans since the film is too outdated to find anywhere else. So much for planning ahead.
4,Social critic or just chilly action?,"Mr. David Jones rated this movie as a chilly excitement for the masses... sorry, I disagree. The message behind the script is not just an ""idea"", but a deep critic to the modern western society. The tremendous value of this ""chilly"" kick and hit movie is that such a message is not just said... you can actually feel it."
3,great...eccept...,i really enjoyed the movie...the concept was creative and different i thought. It was a fast moving movie with lots of special effects...it was really good right up to its limp end...i was left feeling...thats it? thats all of it?
3,More editing,This movie seemed dark. It was hard to follow and it appeared to be a movie they just did not know how to end. They could have cut one half hour off and it would not have effected the content of this movie.
5,unbelievable; mind shattering; true thinking outside the box,"A absolute ""must see"". If you could only see one move for the rest of this year and havn't seen this one. GET DOWN TO THE STORE AND RENT IT NOW!(or buy it on-line) You will not be disappointed."
5,The greatest movie ever made!,"The Matrix is one of the most unbelievble movies ever. I just loved every minute of it. At first, when I saw it at the cinema I was saying to myself: ""Man, I oughta get this movie on DVD once it gets out, it was just amazing!"" And so I did, I got the DVD the day it went out. The sound is AMAZING! Especially on a new AC-3 system. My advice: GET IT NOW!"
2,"Great premise, good start, but a bad finish","I saw the Matrix only because so many people reccomended it to me, and the idea did sound intriguing. And I was pleasantly surprised up until they woke Keanu Reeves up and brought him into the real world. After that not only does it become necessary for him to act, but the movie descends to sickening levels of testoscerone and explosions. It's a shame that they thought it was necessary to keep interest going by blowing things up and shooting everything. But the real shame is that it ruined what could have been a good movie."
5,WHY CANT ALL MOVIES BE THIS GOOD?,"it makes me MAD MAD MAD to hear people say ""it just copies evry kung-foo movie and they stole a lot from Jon Woo and there isnt any plot and the characters cant act ECT.....""...Excuse me, but iff all plots were this thought-provoking and all the special effects were this good, and all the acting so well done, then every movie would get 6/5 ratings!in the first scene with Trinity, I was like ""Who's the good guy and whos bad?"" and i still wasnt clear or that until the Sceene where Neo is being interigated. Most peoplesay "" I had to watch it a couple times before i understood it."" I understood it the first time through. But after seeing it a second and third and fouth and six hundred fourty eighth time I have always cought something new! It is amazing!I CANNOT WAIT UNTIL THE SEQUELS!!!WHOOOWHOOO"
2,average good effects,the effects make this film period.Keanu Reeves is still one of the wackiest actors ever.for effects i give the film a 4 for acting a 1/2.i have seen better Sci-Fi than this film.the film starts out tight than drops.and when you factor in everything it's pretty average.
4,Great movie - Wrong Format,The story line of this movie is great and very original. Very entertaining. The action is non stoping and the visual effects are unsurpassed. I found a problem with the movie which is also common to many other movies on DVD: the anamorphic format. this format which is not standard 4:3(standard format) or 16:9 (true wide screen)make the faces to appear squeezed and unnormal. Perhaps it is time that the editors think more in the integrity of the movie than in their desired to show more movie en less space. For great entertainment I recommend The Matrix.
4,"""The Matrix""...quite a ride!","Although I'm not a big science fiction fan, I really enjoyed this DVD. Lots of action and special effects to keep your interest. All the electronic stores in this area use this DVD as a demo. Buy it and you'll see why! Just remember when you view it to ask yourself the question, ""Do you understand what you just saw?""I give it ""two thumbs up!"""
2,IT WASN'T JUST KEANU REEVES WHO RUINED THIS ONE,"With rare exception (""Parenthood,"" ""Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure""), Keanu Reeves is a detriment to every film he appears in. We've all seen him destroy great films like ""Devil's Advocate"" and ""Bram Stoker's Dracula."" This time, Keanu, don't feel bad, it wasn't you. The script in this film stinks! In a strange attempt to tell the story of Jesus Christ through a futuristic sci-fi film (doesn't sound like a bad idea, right?) this picture only manages to showcase the latest in CGI effects. I must mention, however, the one reason I gave this picture 2 stars instead of one: Hugo Weaver is brilliant as Agent Smith! He is also fortunate to have the only good lines in the film when Smith is telling Neo what he thinks of the human race and our world. What other movies has Weaver been in?"
2,A Mindless Way to Spend an Afternoon,"It must be the ""age-thing"" because I just didn't find this film to be all that others said it was cracked up to be. The special effects were great but the story was somewhat confusing and muddled. The performances from the principles was adequate, although I had difficulty at times understanding both Fishburne and Reeves because of their ""muffled"" deliveries. Both - yes, BOTH - have done better work in the past. I suppose a big pay check was the reason for their decision to get involved in such fluff!This is one of the films that will not ""age"" well. Its use of contemporary terminology and fears about present and future technology will be meaningless in a few years. Thus, the film, no matter its current popularity, will not make anyone's great films' list.For all its Academy Award-winning SFX the flick was no more satisfying than a video game. A less successful film of the early 80's came to mind after I saw ""The Matrix.""Can anyone say ""Tron?"""
2,"The movie, not the car","I finally got around to watching ""The Matrix"" a couple of years after everyone else. I give it a mixed review. The notion of manufactured reality was its strong point. A weak point, however, was the film's anarcho-messianic theme. In between these poles, there was a rather ho-hum formulaic plot, akin to that of, say, ""Top Gun."" I must note that there are strong resemblances to a film which I'll bet few Matrix enthusiasts have ever watched. That is Alexandro Jodorowsky's ""The Holy Mountain"" (1973). Just about everything in ""The Matrix"" that is disgusting to watch seemed borrowed from the Jodorowsky film, as well as Neo's transformation into some sort of messiah at the hands of a magus figure. (""The Holy Mountain"" may be available on some web auction sites - check it out.) The music at the end was good, but that's not to say I want to hear it booming out of some teenager's car every time he drives by my house. Some rules, some walls are not so bad."
5,brilliant film,"The Matrix has to be one of the best films that i ahve seen in a long time, the storyline realy gets you thinking quite alot on whether we realy are in the real world or is everything around us not real?. Anyway for a film staring Keanu Reeves who i usualy dont think is very good i think he does star in this film realy well. If you like the good old sci fi films i think this has to be the film for 99."
3,Decent,I thought I was getting the 10th anniversary packaging(same price) but it is still a good blu ray movie with good quality for cheap.
5,"if the movie is excellent, just guess how good the special..","If the movie is excellent, just guess how good the special will be, look at it in perspective, The Matrix on VHS was great in itself. Now add tons and tons of extras and you get the limited edition PLATINUM version. Now, I have the The Matrix on VHS and the tape is starting to wear out because of the obsessive viewing! Now i will try not to scratch this beauty up, OK!BUY IT BUY IT!"
5,Better than sex!,"No one can be told what The Matrix really is, you have to see it for yourself. Simply genious. Mind boggling. Let yourself fall down the rabit hole like Alice, and enjoy the real meaning of what a movie really is."
5,The thinking man's best choice for action entertainment,"The Matrix does on thing better than any movie I've ever seen: It never leaves any parts open for you to become bored and stare at the wall until the next interesting scene comes along. At one point action-oriented movies were my life, yet later on i found a new reason to watch films. My interest turned to drama and light comedy, where i discovered many good films. I had yet to see, though, a movie that perfectly blended so many aspects that make movies entertaining into one feature-length film. The Matrix is pure genius, of a kind that cannot be achieved by accident. Superb, excellent, outstanding fun."
5,"explosive,well written sci-fi needs to be seen twice .","explosive,deep thrilling adventure that keeps you thinking all the way thru, a must see movie twice no three times to see the underlining truths of this movie, are we in a matrix , i wonder"
5,Pretty damn good,Great movie.....damn good...just not much else to say. Probably the best sci-fi movie I've seen since Star Wars. Any movie that can make Keanu Reeves look cool is worth seeing.( sorry Keanu )
3,Matrix DVD doesn't work on all players,"It appears this disk will not work on all players. Although there is no official word from Warner yet (9/23), DVD Express is making a list of players that will not load this disk. I fully expect Warner will have a new version of this disk, if they ever want my business again...By the way, the movie is top notch and a definite ""must see"". I have been awaiting this release for some time. It seems I will need a bit more patience."
1,Woah! The worst Sci-Fi movie I've ever seen.,"What a horrible movie The Matrix was. I kind of expected it going into watching this one, but I didn't think it would be as bad as it was. The acting, the writing, and even the special effects were awful. I know most people were impressed with the SFX, but I didn't think there was anything special about them. In a movie that has good special effects, you forget that what you are seeing is fake, but that never happens with The Matrix. The SFX was so bad, I had to laugh out loud at times. I'm disappointed I had to choose to give this movie one star when I really wanted to give it zero stars.Don't believe the hype. Avoid this movie at all costs."
1,Style over content.,"If you enjoy overacting, hopeless plot development, and whatcan be best described as a 'two hour rock video' then leave thisturkey well alone. It is utterly pathetic, a desperate attempt to make money (which it did) by having flashy effects and graphics. Did some one say action? well how about following that up with 'John Woo'. Effects mean nothing. Plot and direction is everything. This film tried, it tried hard. A for effort, F for film. Film making has reached new levels of idiocy."
5,GREAT,"The Matrix is now one of my all-time favorite movies. And the DVD version only serves to enhance the ""experience"" that the Matrix gives."
5,Disappointed by this release actually,I bought the ultimate matrix collection on blu ray to only find out this disc seems to have more extras!? Correct me if I'm wrong...
4,Visual effects outstanding.,"Amazing work. Although the plot is a little fuzzy, the action and visual effects(not special effects) are outstanding."
3,It was just okay.,"Sure, there were some good things about The Matrix. The special effects were very well done, the acting was good. And it has some good martial arts scenes.But the plot has some major flaws - things that just don't make any sense at all. (I won't spell them out here, not to ruin the plot.) I felt my intelligence a little insulted at two points in the movie, like I wasn't supposed to notice major plot elements that were just nonsensical.Besides that, the story was not very original; the basic (paranoid brain-in-a-vat) idea has been done before.Not a bad rental, but I sure wouldn't buy it."
4,It stayed with me.,"This was the first movie in a long time where the mood of the movie stayed with me for days after I saw it. I even went out and bought the soundtrack to prolong the mood a bit. Having said that, the movie is not without flaws. It's a weird mix of really dumb, cartoony type of plot turns, and hammy acting, and quite intelligent writing, and effective acting. But the over-all impact was impressive, despite its flaws. As I said, the movie stayed with me, and that's about the best thing I can say about a movie."
4,"No, it's not perfect, but it's still fun!","Yes, there are some parts of the story that don't make sense (if they just need a body for the energy it produces, what's wrong with dogs or cows?) But to hell with that, it's still a very, very fun ride, and I'll watch it many times. As to technical problems; it appears that the problems are with the players. This disc is one of the few to exercise this many features in the DVD standard, and some players (particularly older ones) can't handle it. My advise? Buy this disc and see if your player can handle it, and if it can't, get the maker to fix it; this would be a ""quality of workmanship"" error, since the disc DOES MEET THE DVD SPEC. Worth the price just to make sure your player is up to snuff. (FWIW, I think any new player can handle it)."
5,This is the best movie because of its suspense and drama.,"After watching The Matrix, I was in a daze. I love deep, philosophical movies that make me think, and this was one of them. Keanu Reeves gave one of his best performances and became even more incredible as the movie progressed. I was mesmerized at a few of the points that were made, and which really struck home, such as ""If you're going to hit me, hit me...don't think about it"". This movie taught many lessons for life and how to survive in the world. I was sitting on the edge of my seat the entire length of the movie; it captived me so much. If you like suspense, science fiction, drama, and philosophy, then you will just love this movie as much as I do."
4,"An imaginative, mindblowing SF achievement","Truly one of the best films ever conceived on the desktop. Storyline, special effects, even Keanu's acting are superb. Thought provoking on many levels, not your normal shoot 'em up, predictable action bore."
3,I LOVED THE FLYING MONKEYS AND THE TALKING APPLE TREES,How'd they do that thing with the Great and Mighty Oz? I loved the part where the girl dumped the water on the witch
3,This movie starts out very boring and slowly gets better.,"I think this is the most overated movie of all time.lets be honest, the movie was totaly boring. So boring that I almost fell asleep. The only action scenes were at the end of the movie.And besides, I had alredy seen those scenes from the trailer.I realy dont understand what all the hype is about.Did we see the same movie?"
5,Excellent movie to add to your collection,"If you want a movie to show off your DVD player, look no further. This DVD goes well above others with incredible sound, intence visuals and loads of supplemental features. Not only that but the movie itself is excellent. IF you havn't seen the movie yet, you owe it to you yourself to do that. You won't be disapointed."
5,Matrix the best film of 99,"This is one of the best films I have ever seen! It is original, well thought out, and some of the effects are stunning. It is the first time I have ever been to see a film without coming out and thinking ""I've seen it all before"" even the best of other films you can see links to other films. It is also very clever how it REALLY makes you think about your life and it is plausible that it could happen... It could be disturbing if you thought about it too much. The only downside my TV isn't as big as the cinema screen was!"
2,"Matrix Great - the Audio Mix, Not so much...","Don't need to review the movie itself: easily one of the best sci-fi movies of all time.The Blu-ray transfer is what I have the gripe about. The audio mix was substandard. The dialogue was difficult to discern and the gunfire and other effects were flat. The picture quality is fine, but if you have invested even a moderate amount of money on your home theatre audio, then prepare for The Matrix to disappoint."
2,"Boring, difficult to sit through","Just an awful, boring movie. Some neat special effects, but nothing that comes near worth sitting through. If I had the choice between watching ""The Matrix"" again or leafing through some month-old copies of ""People"" magazine at my dentist's office, I'd go for the magazines.""The Matrix"" is to science fiction as carob is to chocolate. 'Nuff said."
5,John Woo Go Hang Yourself.,"This is the best action movie I ever layed my eyes opon. It also kan make you nuts if you start to belive. There is not much to tell about this movie, you just must go see it. I have seen The Matrix about 50 times already twice at the theathere. and also on dvd. its an Actin move of the highest class ever. And the nev slow motion filming with the moving camra is just amasing. You'l get this feeling in your guts that you cant explayn when you see this movie, I promise."
5,The Matrix brings home the gold!,"This movie is truly fantastic. The way the action scenes are taped in true 3D and in slow motion makes me crazy! I love the way the entire movie pulls you in and makes you wonder if that could ever happen, or if it already has........If you dont have a DVD player, get one and watch this movie in Dolby Digital. It will blow your mind away. Especially the scene where Trinity and Neo go into the office building to rescue Morpheus. A wonderful sci/fi flick for all you computerheads."
5,Pioneer into the Movie Multimedia,"The invigorating, twisted, and psychodelic plot streams it's way though dazzling and memsmorizing special effects. Although the movie might seem untterdly confusing, beneath a couple viewings for the average watcher, reveals a writers masterpice. The movie represents many parrallels, for kids (special effects) , average viewer, a (difficult inviting plot), and the analytic mind, (maybe a taste of something real). Definitly a masterpice,as it combines special effects, brilliant wriitng, and anythign but simplicity, into a viewer's dream. contact me, via arhancsm@jmu.edu"
5,You have to see it for yourself,"I don't know how useful this review will be to you but let me tell you this: Star Wars looked like a muppet parade compared to the mind blowing Matrix.For those who think that the film is about a computer hacker; it is not. This film asks a very philosophical question: ""What is real?"" And the answer is given in a neat way that is almost believable.Additionally, I straggled to find flaws or continuation errors in this film. Perfect. And for those who think that the film actually had flows, they simply weren't paying enough attention.Don't fool yourselves, you have to see this film at least 3 times to understand it.Well done Wachowski brothers. Let's hope the sequel will not spoil it."
4,"Cool FX, clever story","The special effects are thrilling, and the story is quite original, although it belongs to the general genre of ""machines-take-over-the-world"" scheme. I loved it (all 10 times!), and I was mostly captured by the superbe effects and all that magnificent action. However, these are the only memories the movie has left me with. I just remember the big jumps and the extraordinary kicks - maybe cause I only see these from now on, when I play the DVD! Maybe the ""boring scenes"" should have had more depth and leave an imprint in the viewer's memory, just like all the action. In any case, it's a great movie, that introduces the new entry-level action all movies of this genre should have from now on!"
5,The Matrix,"The Movie [The Matrix] Contained on the VHS format is excellant,however I am really disapointed about the dvd edition.I recently purchased a dvd player and was blown away by the picture.How ever when I purchased The Matrix I discovered that the only format in which I could watch it in was wide screen.It, for some reason does not give you the option to watch it in both the normal full screen formats and wide screen formats as all my other dvd's .This is very puzzling to me and therefore I have written to Warner re this topic.To me it denies the full appreciation of the movie in DVD with wide screen being your only option.I have a large 57inch projection T.V. but I still can barely see the picture.To me it seems like the boarders encompas more of the screen then the actual picture.My suggestion to future buyers would be that if Warner does not come out with an optional wide and normal full screen format,then stay clear of the DVD version and be content with purchasing the VHS version. T.F."
3,The Matrix,"The movie is great, my problem is that with all the technology of today why don't they do like VHS movies and format the screen. Maybe some of you actually like it in widescreen. I don't. You should be able to buy a DVD movie in full screen version."
2,Great except for the truly LAME Keanu Reeves,"Great story, writing, direction and effects. The problem is the lead actor. Reeves is certainly talented for some roles, but this hold-on-to-your-seats movie is forced to drag him along. A complete mismatch.A powerhouse action movie like Matrix deserved a strong lead with charisma and masculinity, not a ""pretty boy"" actor such as Reeves. His inability to carry an action movie seemed obvious after Johnny Mnemonic, but I guess he still has all the right connections in Hollywood to grab a choice role like this.What a shame, and what a waste of an otherwise great movie."
4,"cool effects, bad plot","this is a very cool movie, fun to watch and i love keanu reeves. i also love sci-fi flicks so why did i give the matrix only 4 stars? the plot was stupid and lacking just about everything. not fulfilling in the way of a story at all. but dispite all this the special effects are the best i've ever seen and the matrix remains on my amazon.com wish list."
3,Nice for teenagers.,"Awesome special effects, but this film is only nice for newbies in SF and teenagers. Every self-respecting Science Fiction reader simply CAN'T take this film seriously... there are at least 100 plot holes!"
2,"Great idea, poor follow-through","The first half-hour of this movie had me pleasantly surprised. Its premise was going somewhere interesting, the pace was good, and (the biggest surprise of all) Keanu Reeves wasn't that annoying...then they woke him up. From there on in Keanu's lack of talent rose blindingly to the surface and the movie degenerated into a misguided ""let's kill EVERYBODY"" shoot-em-up that lost me very quickly. It's a shame, really, because I feel that this movie really could have gone somewhere worthwhile instead of stooping to such over-done tactics."
5,What can you say about this masterpiece!,"Sounds great on DVD with surround sound, just like being there. A must for ANYONE'S DVD collection. Am anxiously awaiting the sequel."
3,Blade Runner is better.,Ok it had good effects but in a couple of years they will be obsolete the scene when the helicopter crashes with the building if it happened for real if wouldn't look like a circle of water so that was not well done and also the scene when the lobby is full of fire that fire looks like water I must admit that it did had some great action scenes but a soso script and keanu reeves can't act but the agent and Mr. Fishburne saved the movie still blade runner is better
2,What's the big deal?,"Besides the great music, I thought The Matrix was kinda stupid. The acting was horrible, and the sci-fi scenes and dialogue was just too much. The graphics were great, don't get me wrong, but I don't think that it deserved all of that attention."
3,The Curates Egg,"The hype about this film is unwarranted. True, there are some excellent special effects - realistic ones, but many are too false eg gunfight in hall with pillars when gunfire too easily splinters junks of concrete and it falls like polystyrene - as it is. The storyline is somewhat boring, and I fell asleep during twice trying to view the whole film; the third occasion I managed to stay the course but only by fast-forwarding the chunks of dialogue which apart from being boring were also too far-fetched to be believable. In all the film was much like the Curates egg - a mixed bag - some good some bad. I am in my 60s and have viewed many hundreds of films and, generally, I agree the average viewing star-rating. This time I did not."
3,DVD-ROM owners beware of bullying installation,"Those intending to play this disk on DVD-ROM should be aware that it will not play on your regular software but insists on installing PC-Friendly, which is actually a pretty lame player. It might insist on updating various drivers as well. To top it off, if you have the Creative Encore software, the picture won't play at the correct aspect ratio till you figure out how to swap into your regular player and change it. Altogether it took me over an hour to get the movie up and running properly, and it stuck me with software I don't want and don't like. Rude!"
4,Filmed in Sydney....gotta love it! ;),"Isn't it great when a movie filmed in your city (Insipid and characterless, my butt!)and starring one of your countrymen as a truly evil villian does so well? (insert smug grin here) Seriously, though, I love this movie, one of the best I've seen for a long time. Now I've got watch it again to find the anime referances the creators said were there."
5,Best picture I have ever seen,This picture is just so good everything is good and Lawrence Fishburn is the best
3,Good movie with a few problems,"First I'll praise: 1) Those people who say that the effects are bad: IGNORE THEM. They are Oscar deservant (though not this past year, when Star Wars should have won, but in any other year) 2) Good story 3) Cool fights 4) As a film score buff, I enjoyed the isolated music trackHowever, it had some problems: 1) No emotion. During the fights, the actors kept a straight face, which made it look like they were doing about 1% of what they could have. 2) Hmmm... I can't think of a second.... so I guess I'm done"
4,A movie that pushed the barrieers,This commercially popular take on the book Nueromancer takes film making to an entirly different level.The complex shots and thrilling action sequences make this one of my favorite movies.The good: The matrix is entertaing with a good story and superb acting.The bad: Keanu Reeves drags at parts and the added love story subplot was un-needed.The ugly: They are already starting The Matrix 2 & 3... sequels never match up to the original.I give it an overall of four. For being a great and intertaing movie that attempts to liberate the mind but falls up short for bowing in to commercialism.
4,"Good, but overrated.","I've heard people say this is the best movie they've ever seen. I don't agree with that, but I do think it's a pretty good movie. The effects are great, the story is pretty good (the idea is especially interesting and discussion-invoking), but the characters aren't very interesting. The worst part is that you never learn about the supporting characters before they're blown away. The addition of more info on them, plus just a little humor to crack the characters' stone-cold faces, would have made this a 5-star movie, not just a 4-star."
4,Visual Entertaining,"This is not a movie that requires a lot of thought to watch it. The movie was done completely for the special effects, the stop frame photograghy and computer effects. A lot of credit goes to the special effects personal. The acting is nothing special, everyone did a good job but no one did any acting that deserves particular attention. The plot is simple, and the story line keeps your attention long enough to get you to the next action or special effect sequence. Its simple a movie to watch and enjoy the visual effects."
5,Brilliant and Entertaining!,"The first time I saw The Matrix I was bored out of my life. But recently it was advertised on cable and I couldn't help having another look. I was absolutely breathtaken! I think this film has to be seen twice to be liked, because now I agree with those who say The Matrix is one of the best science fiction films of the century! It is smart, engaging, fun, action-packed and thrilling entertainment that impressed the living daylights out of me.I rate The Matrix 9 out of 10. It is a movie you just can't miss, so anyone who hasn't seen The Matrix, see it now!"
4,Excellent Eye Candy...,"The Matrix, the first time I viewed it, was amazing. The special effects were mind-blowing. At my friends house, watching on a DVD player, it was almost a surreal experience. And then I bought the video version. It was still great, but the non-action scenes started to get boring. Now, after the third time, I can't stand it any more. The action sequences, the special- and visual-effects, are simply stunning, the premise entertaining, the actors appealing and their acting not bad. But for some reason this movie just doesn't have much rewatchability value.Keanu Reeves was good, Carrie-Ann Moss was gorgeous, Laurence Fishburne was fun if a little too self-absorbed, and the agents were fun, interesting characters. This is an excellent movie to rent, or to watch once in a while, but despite its amazing sequences, it lacks a certain...charm that the similar and superior Dark City had."
1,Yawn!,"Boring until about the last half-hour or so. Horrible special effects.I would rather stare at the wall for 2 hours.This movie is also extremely overlong.Keanu Reeves must be the worst actor of all-time,he has absolutely no emotion at all. Avoid this one at all costs."
1,Lots of effects. Weak story,"How sad that they took an idea that was spawned by the genius of Neuromancer, and decided in the end to fight the Bad Guys of the Matrix with Guns! To take a smart idea, then decide to fight the virtual representatives of the Machine with guns is ludicrous. They had a chance to add a smart end, but they failed hard! How can you fight a non-physical being with guns. Would have been so much better had they tried to create an infinite loop or logical conundrum that would have caused the Matirx to overload or crash. But guns! It's like shooting a movie screen from the audience so the bad guys don't get you. They were manifestations of the Matrix, not 3D beings that guns would kill."
1,Don't buy if you have a Samsung player it dosen't work,Warner Bros screwed this one up big time. If you have a samsung player it will not load the DVD. And on some other machines the fight scenes repeat over and over. Rent it first to see if it works on your machine.
4,NEEDS OTHER FORMATS,"I HAVE RENTED THE MATRIX ON VHS SEVERAL TIMES AND FINALLY BOUGHT A DVD PLAYER AND BOUGHT THE MATRIX DVD. I WAS HOWEVER DISAPPOINTED THAT IT ONLY CAME IN THE WIDE SCREEN FORMAT. NOT EVERYBODY CAN AFFORD A WIDESCREEN TV. I HAVE A 50"" BIG SCREEN SO IT WAS TOLLERABLE. ABOUT TEN MINUTES INTO THE MOVIE YOU FORGET THE BLACK BARS ARE THERE, BUT YOU STILL ARE FOCUSED ON THEM IN HOPES THAT THEY WILL DISAPPEAR."
1,"Great Special effects, zero plot.","Perhaps if they had put a little more of the budget towards decent actors and writers I would have been more impressed. I found the characters one dimensional, the basic plot ludicrous, and Keanu (though blessedly silent for much of the movie) in a leading a horrible mistake. If this machine intelligence is intelligent enough to construct this alternate reality, enslave all but a handful of humanity, and manufacture mechanical hunter/killers, doesn't it seem likely it would be able to breach the manmade perpetual night or at least find a more efficient power source than human batteries? But, if you want to show off your new DVD home entertainment center with all its frills, this would be the flick to use."
1,I'd give it zero stars,"The powers-that-be in Hollywood are laughing their butts off.The formula: Create cartoon characters that are completelyunbelievable; get a ""star"" for your main character, even if he is a scrawny, wimpy, completely unrealistic action hero (see Reeves); make sure, because the hero is white, that the villains are also white and that there are plenty of sympathetic minority supporting players, lest anyone scream bigotry; come up with an ""original"" idea that in reality was lifted from a 30-year-old Star Trek episode; and (drumroll) fill this baby up with special effects. Bottom line: no characters, no original story, plenty of video-game special effects that, no matter how ""cool"" they may look, still look fake.END"
1,ZERO originality.,"""People who think that The Matrix contains one single original idea should probably not try to read a Phil Dick novel. Their heads would explode."" - Marc LaidlawFrom Star Trek Borg to Sleeping Beauty, there is not a single original thought in this movie. Most of it derives from concepts and theories portrayed in several Star Trek and Outer Limits episodes. Yes, the special effects were good, but they would have been much better had they been illustrating an idea born, and not re-born. The cheezy ending topped it off. I really wish he would have taken the blue pill."
4,Great Movie - Poor Quality Control,Great science fiction movie. This video could have gotten 5 stars if the sound quality had been acceptable. This video was a gift and the sound on the Sony Home Theater setup was poor.
4,"OK, it's good...but not fantastic",Having heard a lot of hype...I was quite excited to see it...truth is...it takes a long time to get going...and all the real clever stuff happens at the end...having said that...great effects...kinda cool story-line...but I was just left with wanting a little more...
5,The Matrix has you,"The Matrix is the most incredible movie I've ever seen. It has incredible action and character developement. If you've only seen the movie once and didn't like it, don't be discouraged. It took me two times to fully understand the movie. This movie beautifully puts together a scifi with an action movie. The special effects are amazing. See this movie, rent this movie, BUY this movie. As far as I'm concerned, it is not possible to make a movie that is better than ""The Matrix."""
2,Too violent and psudo religious.,"To be fair to this movie, I have changed over the months. I now find watch shoot-em'-up stuff to be very unpleasant. As a seriously religious person I am totally turned-off by fake religion/magic events. I was told this was a great movie, and before becoming sensitive to violence, I might have liked it. Too much reliance on special effects/violence and magic for my taste."
3,"Alright, but an overall unresolved story.","Contradicting themes that are underdeveloped. Interesting story about CGI technology though. The usage of CGI is clever, creating a hyper-reality"
5,Great,It was great to watch over and over even though it was for a class. Very intriguing. This is a great video to watch for a business class or leadership class. Many styles of leadership is used.
4,So far so good,I haven't had a chance to watch but a few minutes of this movie. So far the picture and sound quality is very good. Price was good.
5,a cool movie,"when i first rented this movie with my dad, i was about 8. i covered my eyes through the parts with the bug and taking out the bug because my dad said i wouldn't like them. i was trying to ignore it, but i couldn't. the fight scenes in this movie are cool. i saw it again with a friend and watched the bug part and it isn't sick. this movie is really good. people say that it has a bad plot but that's not true. i've seen it about 5 times and i'm not sick of it. it is one of my favorite movies. for an R movie, it isn't to scary. i can't wait for 2 and 3."
5,My Favorite Movie,"This is my favorite movie. Great special effects, amazing action, and a great story."
4,"Stunning visuals, very entertaining, somewhat-woodenly acted","This movie is a lot of fun. The visual effects are awe-inspiring and fresh-looking and the story is very imaginative. I was intrigued the whole way through even though some of the acting was a bit stiff or, in some cases, overplayed. Since the characters are secondary to the universe surrounding them and since some of the performances are quite good, the few mediocre actors never really hurt the enjoyment of the film as a whole. I'd definitely recommend seeing it on DVD, too. The picture and sound are staggering."
2,widescreen format: a hoax.,"I love science fiction movies, and I think the matrix is one of the greatest movies in this genre. However, I was dissapointed when I buyed the DVD version and discovered the horizontal top and bottom black bars displayed on the screen actually hide parts of the picture that are viewable in the standard version (you can watch scenes displayed in standard format on the DVD's special features). I conclude that DVD technology is great, but not exploited in full."
1,Great special effects but little else.,"I had to give it one star, the system won't let you give a zero. This should have just been a computer game instead of a movie. The premise for this movie is just as silly as most of the games I've seen. But I suppose there are enough high tech computer generated special effects, kung-fu fighting and superfluous gunfire to keep the short attention span under 25 crowd happy. It's a torture, however, to watch Keanu Reeves at his wooden worst uttering lines like ""Whoa!"" and ""Whut?"". (Along with ""Excellent!"" and ""Bogus!"" weren't those also his lines in Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure?) I'm sure that this film was a tremendous financial success and will spawn countless sequels and immitators, but all it really reminds me of is some bad acid trips I took in the '70s. ""Whoa, what is reality, man?"" ""Whut?""."
2,Unimaginative drivel,"Let's start with the plot; it's basically Dark City (a GOOD scifi film) without any of the good stuff about Dark City. The entire nonsense philosophy that everyone thinks makes the movie so deep is hundreds of years old and stupid to boot.The acting was subpar. Keanu Reeves couldn't act his way out of a paper bag. The other actors, while competent, were not particularly good or entertaining.The special effects were good, and that's the reason I gave it two stars. Some awesome computer work here.Overall, a piece of crap. Do yourself a favor and watch Dark City or The Truman Show instead."
5,Best movie of the decade,"THE MATRIX is a must-own for any dedicated DVD enthusiast. It is, by far, the best science fiction movie to come along in many, many years."
1,typical computer novice,"total lack of computer & scientific logic by the producer director and script writer, not to mention bad acting bu the main cast"
1,derivative,"This would have been a great movie if I hadn't already seen it before. What I mean is that all the key elements were borrowed from other films, to wit:They Live - alternate reality imposed by evil non-humansTerminator 2 - war of humans vs. artificial intelligenceInvasion of the Body Snatchers, The Thing, etc. - use humans for raw materialLittle Buddha - Keanu Reeves is the chosen oneTake all those and squish them together, and you have The Matrix. Nice special effects, though."
1,This DVD Breaks many many DVD Players,The Matrix DVD has problems playing on many DVD Players. Alot of PC DVD players don't work at all. Many Home DVD players have severe problems.Mine doesn't work at all with this DVD.
1,If only I could have my money back...,"30 minutes into The Matrix I no longer cared if any characters lived or died. If all you want is action and shooting, then this is your movie. Otherwise, you'll find mindless violence, forgetable characters, mediocre acting and dialogue that contains only one memorable line (when Reaves' character is described as 'good looking, but not too smart').At the end of this movie, I felt robbed. Please don't allow yourself to be stuck up too...just say no to The Matrix."
1,The worst action movie EVER,"I must have fell asleep atleast three times during this movoe. It did not meet the expectations i had heard. The action scences were out of context. If you like good movies, do not waste your time seeing this one."
3,Silly,"I thought this film was just plain silly. I couldn't take it seriously. And that ridiculous shiny black leather thing they had going ruined it for me. I hated the lead female character. Some of her moves were the most embarrassingly ridiculous in the whole film, like that stupid praying mantis slow-mo kung fu move at the beginning, and the equally stupid slow-mo sideways wall running scene near the end. Reeves acting was wooden as always, he obviously only gets parts due to his looks and athletic physique, and I've never been crazy about Fishburne. As far as I'm concerned Fishburne's most convincing part was as a NY mugger in Death Wish. But Agent Smith was great, and the guy who played the 'betrayer', i think he was called Cypher, he was great as well. Special effects were good, and the music was good. In short, entertaining but silly. Oh yeah, one last thing, I was glad when that albino blondie chick in the shiny WHITE leather gear got killed."
2,Slow motion masking a bad film,"Contary to what has been written about this film, I don't see anything ground breaking, but only cliche'. The reluctant messiah story is as old as Buddha, Jesus, and Burt Reynolds in the Longest Yard. Even worst, it takes forever to more this tired story along. I felt insulted as a viewer with average smarts by the ""Alice in Wonderland"" reference.For all the CGI hype, it is just that. Slow motion bullets with trails have been done years before in ""Sniper."" I am surprised that the few scenes of over the top gun play where the good guys never get hit still plays with the young who seem to love this movie. There is nothing visionary about taking bad Bruce Lee knock-off fight scenes and put them to slow motion.Production value and cinematography is a disappointment too. Under exposure, and bluing doesn't create a mood, but does creates good night light of two plus hours of sleep."
5,The second best movie of all time,"The Matrix is a fabulous movie. Not just anyone can appreciate the brilliance of this film so it is only for a certain audience. But to that audience it is one of the most intelligent and fascinating movie of all time. Also, the soundtrack is equally as good."
2,Not too good,"The Matrix offers alot of special effects with would please our audience. However, a drawback is that the action is terrible it is totally like chinese movies one guy could actually shoot everyone by himself and he is totally open to gun attacks. I mean I know this is only a movie but even the cast themselves admited that they mimic chinese movies. This is totally only for sci-fi fans. I knew alot of my friends did not like this and so did alot of children."
5,SMASHES STAR WARS!!!!,"While I think people are reading a bit too much into all the ""symbolism"" in this film, I can't deny that it was extremely entertaining, visually stunning, and far and away the best film i've seen all year. Remember the shootout with the SWAT team, with all the marble breaking and dozens of shells falling to the floor??? wasn't that awesome???"
5,"""THIS MOVIE IS THE HEAT""!!!","This movie went ballistic from start to finish. I haven't seenA Movie so action packed since ""ALIENS"". the ""freezeframe and spin"" FX is one of the newest & coolest photography technics used today. the ""Hong Kong the music and slowmo action were perfectly blended as smooth as silk-this film had john woo style written all over it. I loved the characters and everybody lookin' cool in blackleather. This movie had a lot of twists & turns that kept you on edge of your seat and aching for more. ""What a rush- a must see over and over again type a movie""!!! other action movie makers should look at this movie if they're wondering what the people want...Buy this movie now!!!!!!"
5,it's better than i expected,"i was going into the movie expecting to see an incredebly incomprehensive movie with a complicated and boring plot. But i was totally surprised! Sure, the plot was a bit complicated but at least it was comprehensible. I liked this movie so much that i couldn't stop talking about it. True, the beginning is a little weird but i really started to like it when Morpheus explains to Neo as much as he can about what the matrix is. If you haven't seen this movie, you absolutely should. You won't regret it!"
4,Great movie but very unrealistic.,The special effects and the plot was pretty good. But I hate it when you see one guy with one gun shoot like 20 guys with guns without even reloading his gun. But its still a pretty good film and its worth watching at the cinema deffitinetely but I can't see much point in buying it unless you have a DVD player with a wide screen TV.
2,"Good concept, bad acting.","The concept of the story was great. But even Fishburne, who I respect as an actor, did a poor job. Reeves acted as I expected of him, poorly. The cheesy romance brought this title down as well, and the ending was even more cheesier."
2,BORING,"This was the second worst movie i saw this summer (the first was Austin Powers)the acting sucked and there was no plot. The effects were very good, but that does not make a good movie and some things were too fantastic like how can 20 guys can shoot 1000 bullets at the same time at Keanu Reeves and still miss? I recomend The Phantom Menace instead."
4,fantastica pelicula.,Es una pelicula que es dificil imaginar su contenido. La recomiendo grandemente para las personas que aman la combinacion de ciencia ficcion y accion.
4,An action-packed movie that makes you stop and think,"This movie is full of special effects that will dazzle you. However, I found the story of the movie more interesting than the effects. I do not want to give away the point of the movie, but let me say that this movie is absolutely worth the price."
5,The most original/entertaining sci-fi in decades.,"This film is simply the best. I am yet to here anyone say a bad word about it. If you can't appreciate this film in the slightest then there is clearly something wrong with you.However make sure you go in cold, don't let anyone tell you anything about it, do not read extensive reviews, simply go and watch it and be entertained."
5,Take Me To The Matrix,"The Matrix is a movie that is in a class of its own. Like a new strain of movie-making. It forces you to keep your eyes glued to the screen to see what will take place next. This movie made me think ""what if"" all this is true, and I am programmed everyday to do things I normally wouldn't do. Its kind of scary if you think of it. I never get tired of watching this movie. No matter how many times I have seen it before. With its unmatched special effects and grade A acting it's easy to see why ""The Matrix"" was such a critical as well as a box-office smash."
1,2.35:1 Aspect Ratio Stinks,Buy this on VHS. I purchased this on DVD and I wish I could take it back for a refund. The tiny viewing box on my large 31 inch tv makes it completely unenjoyable to watch.
1,I would not take even if it is free,"""What is a matrix? --We don't know, but we know that it exists"". I can't believe people are buying movies with phrases like that."
1,This movie is a joke,"First off the ""fight scenes"" are stiff and slow, if you think they are good then you have never seen good kung-fu flicks, where wire-fu is done right. Wire-fu is an art, but this is a joke. Also thee gun fights are dumb. Watch the JohnWoo film HardBoiled and you will know what I am talking about. Second the story has been done a million times before, and everytime it is better than this. The Truman Show, 13th Floor, and Dark City all handle the ""None of this real"" theory better. Third the FX are not as WOW! as you think they are, StarWars Ep.I a re better. Finaly the bad acting, the acting alone makes me hurl"
5,Over 650 customer comments for a 1st rate DVD,"The DVD creators could have put together a copy of the movie, but they went far beyond that. Congratulations to the people behind the scenes who added some fun and interesting content about the movie to this DVD. The movie is 1st rate, but the DVD is even better!"
1,Save your money,"This movie is bad, and I don't mean ""bad"" in the sense of ""funky bad"" or some kind of negative slang for ""good"". It reeks. A ridiculous plot, saddled with some of the worst acting in living memory it stumbles along with dialogue that seems to have been lifted directly from bad ""Friends"" episodes. Every time my eyes began to glaze over there was some startling special effect to wake me up, but that's just not enough. A movie needs to do more than simply keep you awake. For those who thought Armageddon and ID4 were good pictures you won't be disspointed. For the intelligent human however and especially for science fiction fans, this movie holds absolutely nothing."
1,a waste of time,"Nothing but special effects. Awful acting, nonsense story. I Couldn't even make it through the whole movie it was so bad. These five stars reviewers are playing too many video games. I'd have to take a bribe to sit and look at this garbage again."
1,DVD Will Not Work With Most PC DVD Players,"DO NOT BUY THIS DVD. It will not work with most PC DVD Players. This is probably why Amazon has marked it down so low, since they say there are no returns on opened DVD's."
1,"Great effects, dialogue laughable..","Incredible effects, cool stunt coodination but just listening to K.Reeves talk takes the film down several knotches.. riveting lines like, ""Whoa"", ""Yea"", and ""Dodge this"" should have been left for 'Bill & Ted 2'"
2,Maybe an age gap?,"I thought the acting and special effects were very good, but I am still trying to figure out if I wasted a couple of hours or not. Everyone I know under 30 loves this movie, everyone over 30 isn't really sure if they like it or not. The entire premise of the movie is kind of hokey."
2,More Hollywood Fluff,"""The Matrix"" does have some interesting philosophical concepts, but they are not developed in any way throughout the duration of the film. Like other over-budgetted action-fests today, the directors are afraid of introducing anything original or imaginative into the plot as the typical viewer is likely to reject it as being ""off-kilter"" in some way or another. This would also introduce the risk of losing money, as these kind of films are purely commercial. So you wind up with a cliched bag of special effects and hackneyed dialogue that would make most people that haven't grown up on ""Riki Lake"" cringe. Moronic considering all that could have been done with such an idea. I give it two stars only for several of the spectacular effects that, on their own, would make some magnificent pieces of art."
2,Movie without a brain,"This movie could have been so much more if only the writers used their brains. There is no such thing as perpetual energy. It takes more energy to keep humans alive than you could get out. Even if you bought into that, the ""virtual world"" which allows limitless possibilities ends up in a gun fight. How brainless."
2,Another gothic sci fi...,"I am tired of sci fi that borrows heavily from Blade Runner (gothic sets), Men in Black (more dark glasses), and Superman (shiny leather-clad femme fatale).I was disappointed. The biblical references are arrogant and obvious (trinity, zion, etc)."
3,Matrix...please play!,"I bought this BluRay as a present for Xmas - and wound up returning it for a new copy because it wouldn't play in any of my parents' BluRay players. The second copy could BARELY work in my PS3 (it had a super long loading time) and when I tried to use it in my parents' player, I had to reinsert it a billion times until it actually worked.Then it had several moments of skipping once it actually started playing.The quality of the picture is great, I just don't understand why both copies had a hard time playing."
4,A great movie with awesome special effects,"The only problem is the boring ""hes the one"" destiny crap. The story otherwise is ok, but some stuff in the film got on my nerves. It is a great film dont get me wrong.... but there is that feeling in the back of my mind of frustration when i see this film.The special effects make up for the stories faults. This movie is a great way to show off your home theatre equipment."
5,Matrix DVD,Great movie. Instant classic. Bought it to replace one I lost - promptly found it a day after the new one arrived.
1,This is a glorified video game.,"My low expectations for this film were not disappointed. It takes what could have been a truly compelling idea and predictably suffocates it in mediocre acting, ludicrous shootouts, and special effects overkill. As in so many other movies of its kind, thoughtful intelligence takes a back seat to theatrics and mass audience mentality-this is just so many empty visual calories. ""Blade Runner"", after all these years, still rules."
5,Excellent special effects AND plot!,This movie combines all the shoot-em-up action of the best and then blows away all the others with intense sound technology and special effects. This movie is definitely going into my collection of DVD because you want to see this in WIDESCREEN man!
3,Too green,"I am aware that this movie was shot with extra green in the scenes that occur inside the matrix, however, the screen came through too strong in the Blu Ray release."
2,"Great Movie, Poor Conversion","I love this movie, so I jumped on the opportunity to own it in HD with Amazon VOD. I am very displeased with the quality of this video conversion. The picture looks blurry or fuzzy to the point of being unpleasant to watch. It's possible that my connection is struggling to keep up, but I don't think so, I've not had problems with VUDU movies in this way. If I could return digital content, I'd return this, I'm not at all happy with the quality. My DVD looks much better and I don't even have an upconverting DVD player."
5,"amazing movie, not just entertainment","Matrix is an amazing movie, but not just for the entertainment value. There are many deep truths buried in this movie's metaphorical presentation, if one is willing to open their minds. Obviously, there is plenty of hollywood rendition and some false concepts in it, but I would recommend this movie to anyone, religious or not. This comes from someone who does not watch TV, aside from an occasional sports contest or news, and who hasn't watched a movie in almost a decade. A trusted associate recommended I check this movie out. No regrets here."
4,Amazing action movie with mind blowing special effects,"The Matrix itself is an amazing action movie with mind blowing special effects. It keep my intrest from start to finish and only a few movies actually ever keep my intrest from start to finish. The plotline I agree with most people makes you think of that was the real world and your eyes were just open for first time for example when you can say welcome to the real world. So if your looking for for a great action film with scfi elements and great fight scenes then this is the movie for you to enjoy time and time again. I have watched it mutiple times since it first came out and never ever get tired of it. This is defently a great add on to any action movie collection so if you dont have it yet buy it now, you wont be sorry."
5,BEST MOVIE I'VE SEEN YET,"Matrix delivers it all, action, animaton, special effects, suspense and MORE! This is such a great movie, I also suggust seeing The Cube and The Cell if you like messed up in the head movies :)"
5,The Best Action Movie EVER,"You need to see this movie. PLEASE SEE THIS MOVIE. Ever since I saw this in the theater I have been obsessed with it. I bought it on video, and now I'm in the process of buying the Propellerheads album, because of their song in the movie 'Spybreak'. Laurence Fishburn has got to be one of the best actors around today. The special effects are absolutely incredible and the story line is top-notch. All I'm waiting for now is The Matrix 2 and 3."
2,Not as good as expected.,"This movie was saved by the special effects. The theories presented will appeal to the internet conspiracy junkie. Dead spots, the mad max underworld, dandling storyline left me flat. Predictable plot. What was with the old lady? Without the special effects this would have never been released."
5,It blows your head up!,"I was always convinced that no movie could make me feel ""inside"" it but this one made trick! i went to see it four times and the DVD version has to be mine!"
2,"Lots of ""flash"" with no content","While special effects were well done, the acting, story content, and overall picture quality were generally lacking. You can dress up a pig, but that don't mean you can take him to the banquet!Save your money! Others did by choosing to see Phantom Menace instead!"
5,Good Stuff,"This is the coolest movie i have ever witnessed! Getting this on VHS is not good enough as the movie itself is too much for a pathetic VCR to handle.~~~~~~~~~~~~~okay, basically if the whole fake reality is real them we are living in a computer generated dream world designed to keep us under control to turn a human body into a battery for the use of AI(artificial intellegence) machines. A scary thought yes but with the help of some renegade humans who escaped from the matrix, the ""agents"" are gonna be put on a run.~~~~~~~~~~~~~I would explain more but as no-one can be told what the matrix is, you'll just have to get it for yourself untill the truth is clear to you."
2,"Cool Looking, But Boring","I know hardcore sci-fi fans will probably be upset by this. The Matrix isn't a great movie. It's a cool looking movie with great effects and everything. I found the movie to be very hard and uninteresting to get into. It's not an easy movie to like. Keanu Reeves is his usual bland, wooden self. He doesn't do anything new here. I just think the film could've been a little more entertaining. I know die hard sci-fi fans will hate me for this, but this just isn't interesting enough to get into. Hard to watch."
5,Reference Material for Blu,"Plain and simple, it was like watching the movie for the first time. I sat there with my jaw open at times at how clear the picture was. Some friends came over and it was all the same reaction, one of them went and bought a blu-ray player the next day. For the price of this movie you can't help but buy it. Enjoy."
2,Could've been so much better...,"Yes, the effects were incredible. Yes, the concept was mind-blowing. Yes, Trinity & Keanu look really great in leather & vinyl. But the script - the SCRIPT! and the directing! And the casting! had so much potential, and fell horribly short. Keanu, I'm sorry, I just don't believe you as an intelligent computer hacker. You blew that in ""Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure."" Lawrence, you're a great actor, and with a slightly better director you wouldn't have sounded so laughably melodramatic. And whoever wrote the script, you've obviously seen a lot of X-Files episodes, but you really need to go beyond the TV-audience-pandering dialogue and avoid the overly melodramatic. It's could've been a killer movie, but it just fell short, which makes it all the more disappointing."
3,Eh?,"Did you ever notice when Keanu Reeves speaks he is usually limited to 3 or 4 words. Take an incredibly bad actor, put him in a story with alot of potential, add awesome special effects, and you still have the viewing equivalent of ""Star Wars Episode One"". DVD gives you alot of bang for the buck, but doesnt make up for bad acting. Add a star if you are one of the 3 people who actually like Keanu Reeves."
5,The Matrix,The Matrix is my favorite movie of all time! The special effects are incredible and the plot is cool.
3,MST3K Fans Rejoice -- Rifftrax is Here!,"In Earth's dirty, dystopian future, one in which every person alive is kept in a dark, moist pod and fed misinformation (kind of like Manhattan, only the odors are less pungent), only one man can save us - and that man is Johnny Utah. Wait, no - Johnny Mnemonic. Hold on, that's not it. It's some kind of car name...uh, Horizon, um....Omni. Ram Charger - No, Neo. That's it. Neo. Led by the enterprising Morpheus, and the hot-erprising Trinity, Neo learns his fate from the Oracle, a corpulent, crusty, chain-smoking broad who is likely to put you off Oracles forever. What is the Matrix? It's a laugh-a-minute RiffTrax with Mike Nelson and Kevin Murphy, that's what."
5,Good Movie,"The Matrix, at its core is about realization/spiritual growth/ enlightenment, the plot, the action, the acting and the specical effects are all secondary however, they do make for a good movie that appeals to a wide audience."
2,$72 for one disc??,"This is not a review of the movie - the Matrix is by itself an interesting subject - but instead this is review of what's available in the package you get.I had The Matrix on DVD from back when it first came out. Somehow, when the son moved to College, I lost my Matrix DVD, so I finally decided to replenish my collection and get, what I thought was a 2 disc version with more behind the scenes stuff.Instead, I get a single disk, with the excat same content as my old (collection happy - buyer is not), a poster, some pictures and a frame of the movie blown up. Is that worth the additional $50 (at least)?? I don't think so. But the quality of the DVD is great - as the old one. However, the box, pictures and posters will soon be archived under T for Trash."
2,THIS DISC DOESN'T WORK ON MACS,"The movie is great, when I watched it on the big screen. Too bad I can't watch the DVD. I purchased a new Apple Powerbook with a DVD-ROM, and because the makers only wrote the special features for Win machines, I can't even watch the movie. The disc is useless. The Powerbooks are back ordered meaning a lot of people have purchased one. Maybe makers should start waking up and writing these discs for all platforms."
3,I agree with Larry! (see below),Dazzling special FX--Yes! Acting by Keanuu Reeves--NO! Sorry but this actor has ruined another for me also. I enjoyed the story...even though it has basically been done before. 'What is real' combined with 'Karate kid'! Entertaining movie but not the best sci-fi movie ever made by far! I recommend renting the movie first to make sure you can handle 2 hours of Reeves!
5,The Matrix,"The Matrix, winning four oscars this year, was very well done. The special effecects were outrageous. The over-all storylines are hard to explain. Even though this movie was rated ""R"" {for sci-fi violence and minor language} I feel it is appororate for younger viewers. One thing though, there is a part where Ned,{Keanu Reeves} goes into a building with a trench-coat,and under it is a bunch of guns, and he ends up shooting alot,[ well duh!]. To really understand how hard this is to describe, watch it your-self."
2,"Great idea, mediocre execution","A great idea for what could have been a great movie. If only they would have spent more time on the developing the plot and less time on special effects. The very shallow development of the story makes for a mediocre movie. If all you care about is great special effects, explosions, and gun fire you'll love it. Otherwise, there are much better sci-fi movies out there."
2,I can't remember a single special effect,"I found this movie rather trite and cannot remember much of it now. At the time, I thought it was very similar to the Wesley Snipes vampire movie but found that much more entertaining, and Wesley Snipes much more interesting to watch that Keneau Reeves."
2,Incongruous Story Line,"If the creators had spent as much time on the story line as they did on special effects this might have been a pretty good SciFi flick. The characters are capable of morphing into ""virtual reality beings"" to survive various assaults but, for some curious reason, they fail to use that ""power"" to their best advantage. I'd rate the computer generated special effects, while not entirely flawless, as a seven out of ten. But the rest of the work appears fairly conventional with no real surprises for the viewer - more like a video game than a feature film piece."
5,The Matrix Rocks!,"No need to ramble about how awesome this movie is, so I'll keep it short and sweet.-Watch this movie and watch it again and again. -Best action movie ever! -The reason DVD was created was to showcase a movie like this. Digital Sound and Picture has found it's poster child!"
5,simply the best movie i have ever seen!,"The Matrix is unlike any other movie i have ever seen, and the best. I dug the kung-fu stuff and the techno music too. The strange storyline really got me thinking!"
5,"You can be ""THE ONE""","Most of my friends agree that this flick is worth owning for the effects alone. But the more you watch it, the more you realize what a truly classic idea this is----when the oracle tells Neo that he is not the one, but that knowing you are is like knowing you are in love. Anyone who has really loved something before instantly realizes that this is one of the coolest movies ever. If you have ever dreamed of being a super hero before, this is your chance to see it happen. Some people were bothered by a few scenes that really seem too incredible---but I say if they believed they could do it, it could happen. The world wasn't real, after all. What can you do in your mind?"
3,Great looking film,"The best thing about this film is it's look; great effects and cinematography. If that's all there was to this movie, however, I'd probably hate it, but the film has just barely enough of a story and decent characters that watching this movie is better than bearable. Those cybernetic-octopus thingies made the film for me."
4,Great but hate the Wide Screen,I loved the movie when it first came out and I waited for it to come out on DVD.When it did I baught it but was surprized that it only comes in wide screen which I'm not to found of.Another problem is that it will want to install software to your computer which is just a waste of space.I wish there is a way to get rid of that program because everytime I load the dvd into my computer it wants to load that stupid program.But a great movie for special effects.Just wondering if they will make a non widescreen version.
1,Attention Mac Users!,"This is the only DVD I have come across so far that will not play on a Mac equipped with DVD. The fine print on the back of the box says so! I also tried it and it's true; it simply doesn't work! Pretty sad if you have one of those nifty IMac DV machines.For a film about a computer hacker exposing and breaking down the establishment, this is really ironic!Don't get me wrong; I love The Matrix. In fact I think it was definitely better than The Phantom Menace. Nevertheless I forced to give it one star because it is the only DVD I have come across so far that won't play on a Macintosh."
1,A stylish mess,"This film is so dull and boring and is a major dissapointment after the brilliant Dark City. It clunks along at a very slow pace every now and again throwing in a fight sequence to releive the boredom. It tries too hard to be too many things. It never reaches the mythological, adventurous or down rite fascinaiting levels of the four Star Wars movies. Neither does it bring home a ""man against machines"" message that the Terminator films do. The Matrix looks good just like Keanu Reeves. But like it's star it has nothing to back that up."
1,Wake me when it's over...,"Heavy handed new age metaphor drowned in a blinding overkill of special FX. Really clunky script, too. Stereotype characters from casting central, horrible cliches trying to pass as archetypal figures: Joseph Campbell's ""The Hero With a Thousand Faces"" as visually interpreted by a fifteen year old boy with a ""QUAKE"" fetish. Totally masturbatory shoot out sequences too, hard to believe that this film hasn't been skewered by the public in light of all those school shootings."
3,On & Off.,"Well, it had an interesting story, overblown special effects & all, but for some reason (& tons of people I've asked in college agree)that it gets more & more boring every time you watch it."
3,Unclear Motive,"One of the reasons given for the war against ""the agents"" and their matrix, is the survival of ""Zion"". But Zion appears to be nothing more than a dark and filthy hole in the Earth-- definitely not worth fighting for. An interesting film with dazzling special effects, though."
5,Excellent movie...,"However, did anyone notice that 'Neo' is an anagram of 'One'?That's right! Of COURSE you did!"
2,"special effects are good, but...",if you love special effects and aren't real concerned with boredom for the mid-45 minutes of a movie then buy this now.
2,Boring,"One of only 2 videos I've rented in the last few years that I couldn't finish watching, because it bored me to death. The big problem was that you simply don't care about any of the characters. You don't like them or hate them. They are not interesting in any way. So in spite of a good plot idea, and good special effects, the movie still managed to be VERY boring."
2,Good for people who like these kind of movies,"According to the commercials and previews before this movie came out, it look real cool with a lot of action. But when I saw the movie finally it didn't have a lot of action as in the commercial. Not till the end is where there's action, but the battles don't last long enough in the movie and there isn't enough. The plot wasn't that interesting either.The only thing I thought was cool was the special effects and action scenes. If you really like computer art, weird, and sci-fi movies, The Matrix is for you."
2,over rated,"Along with Face/Off this is one over rated pilesof Hollywood garbage,instead of watching this painfull excuse of a movie rent out Dark City for basically the same plot premise but with alot more thought ."
5,What is the Matrix?,"It's pretty much a nerve wracking job trying to look for intelligent sci-fi(at least in the movies). This is a diamond in the rough. Amazing action and fight sequences by the master, Yuen Wo Ping, and a great plot that draws many parallels to gnostic christianty. That's right, you'll have to watch this one a bunch of times to start to grasp the full meaning. Follow the white rabbit."
5,Good effects and Keanu -- what more do you want?,"I must admit I have a fondest for Keanu Reeves but I don't see everything he is in and I am a picky science fiction fan. That said the effects were wonderful, the twists entertaining, the questions about the nature of reality intriguing, and the sound track intense. Of course this is a rehash of the ""machine will be humanity's downfall"" but an interesting turn on the old idea of mere slave or destruction."
5,1727 th review - who will ever read this!,"Yeah! They are all right! This movie is crazy, astounding, perfect, superboosted as perfectly balanced. Keanu Reeves is the One. Laurence Fishburne is the Guide. Carrie-Anne Moss is an awesome kind of Trinity. You need it."
5,The DVD extras are worth the price of admission,"Yes the movie's cool - I speak for the DVD ""extras,"" which are numerous and imaginative. As you watch the film a WHITE RABBIT will appear that you can ""follow"" to a look behind the scene you are watching - it takes you there, shows you how they did it, then brings you back to the film which continues on. Plenty other cool features too. My only COMPLAINT: the audio commentary is self-congratulatory and ""didn't we make a cool movie?"" more than informative. Overall though, the highlight of my DVD collection."
3,Could be better,"Nicest DVD quality & interactive programe I have seen so far. As for the movie, special effect, sound and cinematographic are great, but, the mood of the movie is rather un-smoothy.The main plot of the movie is very good and interesting. I've seen lots of Sci-fi/action movies, this one is just not up to its reputation. The exitements and mistyrius built up from the beginning and peak up to climax within the first 30 minutes of the film, then it started to decline, then some boring scences came in. Also 2-3 times, there were dialoques that made me expected that the good stuffs might come up. Then the movies ended. The movie is not too short but I think they organized the story poorly. Don't know who to blame, but this movie could be better, really.Oh, one more thing, Keanu Reeve never looks better (since he had relatively less lines to speak)."
3,this movie ruined itself,"OK. The Matrix had a great concept. Sure, it was a bit similar to some writing by Lem (The Futurological Congress, Further Reminiscences of Ijon Tichy, and so on), but that's ok. All the groundwork concepts in the first half of this movie were amazing. People being farmed and fed hallucinations, reality only being what you think it is--great! The only problem is that about halfway through, the movie simply ceased to make sense. Neo comes back to life because Trinity kisses him? They have to get phone calls to come back into reality? Unplugging them from the matrix kills them, but Neo survived his initial unplugging? These all-powerful robots who control everything in the Matrix have to resort to fallible ""agents"" to do their dirty work? What? If you want some real sci-fi, go watch Twelve Monkeys. Or better yet, read some short stories by Stanislaw Lem--that'll *really* play with your definition of reality."
5,"THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE, EXCLAMATION POINT!",I will put this in one sentence: Anyone who rates this movie anything less than 5 stars should be put away for life.
2,The Matrix(Blu-ray),"I purchased this blu-ray to upgrade from my DVD. The Picture transfer is great,BUT the audio was a poor excuse for a Blu-ray. This is the worst blu-ray i have come across since the first release of Terminator 2 on blu-ray. If you want T2 on blu-ray the skynet edition is an excellent upgrade!! Warner Bros. needs to do the same and upgrade the audio to a 6.1 DTS for one of the best action movies of all time to truely experience the dynamic sound that The Matrix should be watched with. Until then dont waste your money on this Blu-ray if you own the DVD."
5,There will never be anything like the matrix,"I don't care what anybody says there will never again be anything in history like the matrix. No one can deny the matrix revolutionized action movies forever. The bullet time effect, the 360 rotation, and the slow mo will be something used in movies forever. Long live zion!"
5,One of the best movies ever!!!,"Neo, Morpheus, and Trinity, oh my!!! I just saw this movie today and is dying to see the 2nd!!! I always liked Morpheus the best. I didn't like Neo that well because he didn't seem like 'the one' and I was expecting him to wear the black jacket and those glasses but like half of the movie he was bald! The only thing I didn't like about it was that they were in the real world most of the time! I recomend this movie to any sci-fi fan"
1,What A Mess,"People thought Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyssey was confusing. This movie takes the cake. I'm a smart guy, I have a graduate degree, but this film just seems to lack any substance. It's all Kung Fu fighting and special effects thrown in for good measure. The second Matrix film isn't any better which I saw at the theater. The film doesn't come across as clever, nor intellectual and it isn't even a very good action film or science fiction film for that matter. I know a lot of people seem to like this mess of a film, but save your money. I don't really think it is a film that will be regarded like 2001 A Space Odyssey 20 years from now. I'm afraid it may be forgotten."
1,This movie sucks! Wachowski Brothers suck!,"Talk about copycats! This movie has no ORIGINALITY! Its like stealing and combining Terminator 2, Japanamation, and John Woo movies all into one! The ""Bullet Time"" sequence is the only scene worth mentioning. Just because it has a ton of cool FX doesn't make it a good movie at all! The Wachowski Brothers need to think of something creative instead of BITING nips and pieces of other people's ideas!"
1,Elementary Philosophy,"Nice try. I liked this film better the first time when it was called TRON. Stupid philosophical schmaltz passed off as the real thing. Is the idea of illusionary reality a new thing? For fans of the Matrix it may be. Go read some books and find out how watered down this movie really is. I hated it all the more due to its tedious marketing and hub-bub. Tron had Jeff Bridges, the Matrix has dumb-face. Tron had GOOD computer special effects that were unlike anything seen before. Matrix has off the shelf effects that we've seen before in about a thousand video games. Is this a film or a video game intro? A bunch of worhtless garbage. Go buy it and tell your friends how great it looks and sounds on your Sony."
4,A little over hyped to me,"Obviously this movie is quite old at this point, so I have heard about it for years. I heard that the fight scenes and graphics were great, and though impressive when it came out, both are pretty outdated today. Though the storyline is magnificent don't expect a lot from the visuals of this movie."
2,Great idea poorly executed.,"The movie started with an interesting idea and great promise. But it turned out to be just another ""blow 'em away - body count movie"" that Hollywood loves to churn out these days. I'm not an anti-violence type, it just gets boring after so much. It turns into ""cheap fill"". The movie had the talent and the budget; they just blew it."
1,A big dud,"If you want to see a clever, action-packed and truly witty sci-fi classic then watch ""Total Recall"". In its action, its scripting and its philosophic sophistication, ""Total Recall"" easily dwarfs this pretentious and self-regarding piece of idiocy. The acting is indifferent. The action is barely solid. The ""philosophical"" treatment of the Cartesian apperance/reality problem is elementary. Even the effects are nothing special, in spite of the massive budget. And why does the chief villain have to mince every sentence like a constipated Nazi? The awful dialogue contains such lines as this -- ""Do you believe in fate?"" -- ""No...Because I don't like the thought of being controlled."" The immense popularity of this mindless and overlong bore is mystifying, but then again, what can one say considering that the majority is always wrong? It seems to be aimed at the core audience of cybernerds and computer geeks, upon which it has numerous enthusiastic fanatics. To be missed."
1,Sorry,"I thought the Road Warrior was much, much better as an action movie. don't waste your time with this one."
4,An Awesome Visual Experience!!,"This movie is a monumental achievement in visual effects. Despite the wierd plot and development, this movie still makes for an exciting visual roller coater ride."
4,An exciting movie full of action worth watching!,I think this a great action movie!I t will make all of you want to see the sequel!
3,Really annoying,"Unfortunately, the dialog and video are out of sync on my Pioneer DVD500 player. What a disappointment. And the hassle of trying to exchange with no guarantee of a properly working copy. This is the first DVD problem I have ever experienced and it had to be on this movie. What a shame."
3,"Don't believe the hype, but lots of DVD extras","Good job on the DVD, lots of nice extras, especially if you have access to DVD ROM in addition to a standard DVD player.Unlike most others, however, I didn't care too much for the movie itself...maybe it was just hyped too much, setting up an expectation that it couldn't live up to. Never really cared for the characters..."
5,I'm not going to rate the software with the DVD...,"..because I was not too happy with it. But using the DVD player that is on my computer, and working out a few sound bugs, this film was more than well worth the money spent. After watching it a 5th time in 2 days ;), I can't believe I didn't see it more times in the theater! I'm not going to say ""one of the best"". In my opinion, it IS the best!"
2,Film for Gun lovers. Cultish.,This movie has lots of guns. They have big guns and small guns. I personally like the Matrix better than reality. Lie to me as long as you tell me what I want to hear. What is the point of getting out of a decent fake world to go to a disgustingly horrible real world? Keanu Reeves didn't look all that hot with that awful hair cut.
3,sound or movie ?,"ok..what do you want when you watch a DVD movie ? Do you want great sound or a great film ? The Matrix has Keanu in it, so we aint buying this for acting now are we ? The sound is brilliant but the movie is average...maybe a little above average. I think the visual and sound effects will keep anyone interested for the first couple of screenings but if you watch movies many times, I think the gimmic of great sound will wear off. A great one to borrow from your mates for a while wihtout paying for it !"
4,I HATE TV-SERIES BASED ON MOVIES,"I don't know why I like this movie that much, actualle It's a blend af the movie Dark City, 1984, Terminater ect. but what the hell, it's non stop action, that must be the coolest part. Well I do want to by the movie, no movie collection is complete with out it. Intertaining? absolutly. Story is ok, but could be a bit better, I hope they never make a tv-serie based on this movie, I always hate when they do that, it will surely ruin the movie, just like Robocop and those stupid animated movies about the droids from Star Wars."
5,"For this movie, what can I say but...WOW!","The Matrix was, in my opinion, THE movie to see of the year. Forget Episode One: The Phantom Menace; The Matrix blew it out of the water! With it's amazing visual effects, gripping plot and storyline, and wonderful acting, it was a movie that kept me on the edge of my seat, and had me walking out of the theater wondering, ""What -is- the Matrix, and is this possible?"" This movie is definately a must-see for ANYONE!"
5,"This movie absolutely ROCKS, nothing else you can say","If you haven't seen this movie, be prepared for the best sci-fi action movie in years. One viewing will leave you with your hair blown back. Then when you dig into multiple viewings, trying to find errors and inconsistencies, you realize that the Wachowski brothers have put the care and thought into a movie that YOU, the true sci-fi fan, would put into it. If only you had their talent. ;) The story is consistent and intellectually stimulating, the ideas fresh and original, the action exciting, and the cinematography creates a perfect, consistent atmosphere. The lighting, camera angles, and special effects combination is like the perfect spice that you just can't put words to, but just want to eat again and again. If they can do this consistently, movie fans can rejoice for years to come. Forget the usual Hollywood cheese, the Wachowski brothers have created a true classic."
1,1999's Worst Offering,"How so many people loved this film, I will never know. It was AWFUL! I had to walk out of the theater during the ending (the ""I love you"" scene, how anybody can even LIKE this film after seeing that scene is WAY beyond me). Gag me with a spoon. Oh, wait a minute, there IS no spoon. Maybe if this film gave itself an injection of self-mockery, it would have been worth the time, but alas... For those who hated this film, see ""Fight Club,"" and I promise, you will not be disappointed. It is sort of the thinking man's ""Matrix,"" at least as far as style is concerned. Also check out ""Dark City,"" which this film so blatantly ripped off."
1,Kung fu fighting!,"The most overrated film in recent memory makes its debut on video. Big deal! Sets are stolen from ""Metropolis"", ""Brazil"" and ""2001"". Script is stolen from Hindu scripture. Acting is stolen from ""The Pretentious School of Something Important is Going On Here, Ha Ha."" And Keanu Reeves is the worst actor ever to appear on film, besides also-rans like Martin Milner. The only exhilarating moment of this ponderous, stupid movie is when the Oracle (oh, what a surprise, she's a cookie-baking, cigarette-smoking blue-collar woman) tells Keanu, ""You're cuter than I thought,"" and then, a moment later, ""You're not too bright."" I wasted two hours of my life with this movie and am spending another five minutes to warn others to STAY AWAY!"
1,worst movie ever?,"I am saddened and dismayed that I wasted over two hours of my life trying to understand this worthless set of pictures they call a movie. I openly admit that I didn't understand it, but what on earth is the point of a movie that 1% of the population can easily comprehend? The special effects were highly overrated. With what computers can do today, why was anyone shocked at the ""great"" effects? Everyone says they understand the movie, but do they really? I may be the only one that didn't jump on the Matrix bandwagon, but I'm proud to say that this is the worst movie I've ever seen"
2,"Drawn Out, Thin, Predictable Plot and Bad Acting","Great special effects, but Drawn Out, Thin, Predictable Plot and Bad Acting. It felt like 2 hours before it got out of first gear. I kept waiting for the main story to start but the first 3/4 of the movie was prep and fluff. Best movie of all time? Are you kidding me? This was no Godfather."
3,A fantastic start....and a dumb old hollywood finish...,"A fantastic premise degenerates into a impossibly crazed shoot em up.I found it a fun movie that almost touched on some poingant theories about human existance, but then decided it wanted to be about blowing stuff up.I will say that the fight coreography is up there with Ping's best work in Hong Kong...thought often a blatant ripoff of that same work. No problem though, most of us haven't seen it!Worth a rental, and for folks who want to show off how loud thier sub-woofer can go, worth a purchase."
1,Rental Fail,rented it through HDTV WiFi. constant buffering and loading. Never did watch it. rental fail. Will rent DVD next time.
4,matrix need i say more,picture i sharp but grainy looks good on it thoughsounds great but not the best movie to show off ur tv
4,Overrated,"What can I say about this film? It's a classic. And, just as classics go-everybody talks about how good it is but don't really read it or watch it."
5,Best Special Effects Ever.,"This movie is easily one of the best I have ever seen. The dialogue was revised to perfection. Great performance by Laurence Fishburne and Carrie Anne Moss. The special effects were amazing. The bullets, the explosions , and the kicks-oh the kicks. This has been a great experience in theaters. I also like it because it makes you question everything..."
2,Wait a minute!!,"Don't buy this video yet! I saw Matrix several times in the theater and loved it but...IT IS NOT THE SAME ON VHS!! Even with a good TV and Dolby surround, much of the power and intensity of the movie is lost on the small (not letterboxed) screen. Check this out at your local $1 theater or buy the DVD."
4,The real Phantom Menace!,"I wonder if George Lucas saw this little gem of a movie coming. Not only did it steal some of its thunder, it stole some of its box office preventing it from beating Lost World in opening weekend stakes!What! How could a film hosting Keanu's brilliant acting abilitys steal some of 'The Phantom Menace's' thunder. I'll tell you why! Breath-taking action and fight sequences, amazingly cheesy dialogue. Yes, you got it in one! Even cheesier than the dialogue found in 'The Phantom Menace.'One major problem, maybe the action scenes are too few and the explanation of the matrix too many. I find now, when I watch it, I fast forward to all the action sequences cos lets face it. Everything else about the film on second watching is boring!On a whole, this film is a well-polished little gem that sneaked up unawares on the public just like in the story of 'The Tortoise and the Hare!'"
2,....,Ok right off the actor Reeves is not a good actor. Worst of allhe was suppose to be this martial artist but he had no movesperiod. The way they exagerated the fights was horrable. On the other hand the special effects were great and the story line and idea were good but if you saw Dark City you would realize where they got the idea for the movie. Best part about it was that it makes you question the reality that you were given and shown to you.
5,One of the Greatest Sci-Fi Flicks!!!,"When I first saw the trailer for this film I knew I had to see it, I saw images of stuff I hadn't ever seen before and I think that's why this film did so well. It seemed to be a breat of fresh air that the sci-fi realm needed (especially with Episode I being a disappointment). I normally don't like Keanu but he did really well in this one, and Carrie-Ann Moss was exceptional. I really love the way this flick starts out because you don't really know what's going on and it's really mysterious. The sound is awesome on this DVD and there doesn't seem to be any articacts on the video, if only we had a DTS sound selection."
5,It was great!!!!!!!!!!!,"It was the best movie I ever saw. The graghic were great. It some times was a little confusing but if you stick with it you will think it is great too. It was, overall, the best movie."
2,This movie redefines over-rated.,"People must really be starved for originality if they are embracing this movie as being anything other than usual action rehash. Keanu does his best to look disoriented (that's a real stretch for him I bet) and Fishburne spouts sayings like a 21st Century disciple from Yoda Community College.Of course, many of today's filmgoers don't need any more intellectual stimulation than a stylized Keanu running around in an overcoat with a gun, so this DVD will be a huge seller. I truly feel sorry for those that think this movie is ground-breaking in any way."
2,Poor.,"The blu-ray transfer for this loked fairly appalling to my eye. Each layer of depth looked overly independent and made the film look very false. I don't know of a better way to describe it, but even at the very low black friday price I would rather buy a regular dvd copy and watch that. Not recommended."
3,Not a great conversion.,"I was kind if exited when I bought this but the movie just didn't transition as well as I thought. I'm still glad I have it in my collection, but I was expecting a lot more from this one."
5,Classic!,This movie remains a classic with its innovative filming to its imaginative storyline. A great cast of actors who were willing to try something new.
5,Best Movie,Love this move! I could watch this movie every day. Special effects are awesome and just love the story line.
2,warning,"This is a warning: this film is NOT a sci-fi movie about hackers. This movie IS a call for VIOLENT MARXIST revolution. This is not a joke. Please think about what it means when they say that ""reality is what we make."" Please ponder what they are saying when Morpheous says that ""..if they are not for us, they are against us..."" then they massacre security guards. Please understand what it really means when Neo chooses the RED pill. I am not joking. If you don't believe me, email me, or read the ""Manifesto of the Communist Party"" by Karl Marx yourself. See this film for what it is, and think about the irony of millions of people enjoying it."
5,One of the all-time best movies.,"Most movies don't just grab me. This one did. I've got to hand it to the Wachowski brothers. They really came up with a gem with this one. Anybody who likes Sci-Fi, anybody who likes action, and anybody who likes to be entertained should definitely buy this film and watch it many times!"
3,"ENTERTAINING MAYBE, ANYTHING MORE THAN THAT PROBABLY NOT",Something between Terminator and a video game it has some interesting moments and a lot of unexceptional ones. Just another idea of some filmmaker that found its way to the screen.
2,Matrix is too busy,"Maybe I'm dense but I couldn't follow the story line. I kept waiting for everything to make sense, but the movie seems to be an excuse to provide a backdrop for an endless series of technically interesting but comically stupid special effects. I admit that science fiction is not my favorite theme."
1,Reeves killed it for me,I believe that if someone like Tom Cruise or Denzel Washington was the star then this would have been more compelling but Keanu Reeves is such a horrible actor and so painful to watch that it killed this movie for me.Following it was difficult. The concept was good and Laurence Fishburne was fantastic but Reeves was as bad as he always is. Why does this man continue to get work...???
4,You have to pay attention watching this film,"I seen this movie three times last year.I had three dates last summer,and everyone wanted to see this film.The first time was fantastic.It was exciting,but you have to pay attention.The first hour explains the Matrix,then the adventure begins.Laurence Fishburne is the best actor in the movie,and he explans the Matrix to Keanu and the rest of us. You'll have a great time renting this Movie,and at the end it makes you think,maybe were all in the Matrix."
4,Alright DVD,"I won't comment on the movie, except to say that it is horribly overrated.The DVD is pretty good when it comes to the tech side. Great picture and fantastic sound. A boring commentary and some behind the scenes stuff. No trailers, which is becoming a very disturbing trend on DVD's.A decent DVD, I just wish people would quit touting this DVD as revolutionary. Many SE's came out before this with many more features."
3,Not my kind of movie I guess,"Everybody always told me to watch the Matrix, so I did. The special effects and the graphics are great. So are the fighting scenes. And Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne are good actors. But the movie didn't really do it for me. I liked A.I. much better (is that a fair comparison??)."
5,Still Great,"I remember being blown away by this movie when it first came out; unfortunately the sequels never reached the same level IMO though. In it's day The Matrix was ground-breaking on so many levels that I couldn't get enough of it. I still very much enjoy this movie: the story, action, effects, and yes even romance were all well done. It's difficult to recommend this movie to a specific person or audience, because it offers different aspects to different people, but if you haven't seen this movie by now then it may not be for you. One thing I can say though, if you've seen this one and not the other two you're not missing much."
3,Still entertaining,"Although this movie still has good production value, special effects, stunts, etc. the story is not at all plausible to me. It seems that the whole premise of the film is to contrive some story explaining why the world we live in may not be as real as we think. It also seems that the main characters all seek the advice of a fortune teller to inspire their decisions."
2,Too many chase/fight scenes for my taste,"Lots of ""cool"" looking scenes and mystery in the beginning, but it was drawn out too long. Midway into the story and we still did not know what was going on. I got bored many times after the halfway point and would have turned off except I had to watch for a class.For the young male viewer I am sure, as are most movies today. Sigh."
5,one of my favorites,"Wow, what a trip! I've seen it three times since it came out and am still going back for more. I think it would appeal to anyone who has ever pondered reality and come to the conclusion that it's all completely subjective. The sci-fi element of the Matrix is well-conceived and believable to anyone with an imagination although some suspension of disbelief is necessary. Despite the fact I'm not a huge fan of martial arts movies, I was very drawn in by the use of martial arts here: it's appealing to think we are all physical equals contingent upon our mental power. Finally and importantly, the acting was excellent and the cast created engaging characters. So many people I know look forward to the sequels with great anticipation."
2,Can it get any worse?,"It's something scrumbled together from MIB, Jackie Chan, Blues Brother and Terminator, in my opinion it's not very creative. Keanu Reeves as the chosen one, absolutely ridiculous. He should better apply for 90210!!"
5,WORDS CAN'T EXPRESS HOW MINDBLOWING THIS MOVIE IS,"This movie was great from beginning to end. The special effects, storyline, and acting is phenominal, forget Star Wars, this is THE must see movie of all time! Can't wait for the sequel!"
5,Best movie ever!!!!!!!!!!,I loved the movie. The visual and audio effects were awesome. They truly broke the mold when they made this one. The soundtrack was also awesome
5,Mind-Blowing special effects,This DVD is genious. To get to watch this movie in three different ways is awesome. First watch it normally. Then follow the white rabbit and probably the most ingenious thing is to watch the movie with only the sound track. WOW! The only thing missing is a version that fits normal tv screens. It only plays in the widescreen format.
2,"Nice effects, but no story...","I was expecting a lot more from this movie. No doubt, the sound and effects are top-notch, but I thought we were to the point that good Science Fiction needs a great plotline with good character development. This wasn't it. I was expecting twist after twist of confusion and conspiracy, but you know what's going on about 20 minutes in. Check out Blade Runner for futuristic landscapes and Total Recall for twists and turns that keep you thinking ""What is reality here?"" If you want the latest special effects in a Mortal Kombat setting, The Matrix is it."
4,DVD problems,"This is a great movie. You'll really get immersed in the world they portray to you, however you may want to buy the VHS version. The creators tried to jam pack this DVD full of extras, but it causes the movie to freeze at inoppertune times. You also cannot access all of the extra features. The manufactuer is aware of these problems & intends to re-release the corrected DVD mid-end Jan 2000."
5,Matrix is a great movie,This is a spectacular movie with outstanding visual effects! It is by far my favorite movie of all time!
5,The movie that redefined the action-genre.,"When previews for The Matrix hit the movies, people were probably confused as well as excited. Me, I was more confused then excited. But, I put my differences aside and I fell for the ""what is the matrix?"" ploy and then I was just blown away. This movie was one of the few that I have seen that can balance science fiction, comics, hong kong action and anime films all at once. You weren't sure what you were watching at first, but you didn't care. It grabbed you and held you as you went deeper into the world of the Matrix.Yeah, it may not be the best movie I have ever seen, but it is high on the list. Even if Keanu is not an Oscar calibur performer, he is still enjoyable to watch as Neo. It's a great popcorn flick with a little philosophy and a lot of style."
5,great HongKong fighting arts with superb special effect,"Wow! That's certainly the first word coming out of my mouth watching this DVD. In fact, a tremendous story meets great Asian KungFu fighting, all salted with lots of mind-blowing visual effects. This all plus the great soundtrack makes ""The Matrix"" one of the most astonishing films of the last decade. So, buy this DVD and,....,enjoy the real world!"
4,Startling picture resolution; good entertainment,You need to be nice enough to get bad to a nice lane where entertainment reaches a climax that an angel prefers watching than engaging in Godly service. My kinda film anyday!
4,Special Features,"The special features didn't work with my DVD player. It may have been my player, but it was annoying."
4,"Good for the Matrix Fan, GREAT for one with a home theatre.","In my opinion, this movie could've been in black and white and I still would have bought it. If I had known I would have shelled out the $60 to get the collector's edition. But, I must say I was a little disappointed when I realized that I got the widescreen version because I'm only playing it on a 19"" TV. But, I do say this: If you have one of those wide screen TVs, this is definitely worth it-and worth it if you have a bigger than 19"" TV."
4,The Matrix,"Acting was good and the casting was very good, but the special effects is the main reason to watch the movie. The best effects I've ever seen"
4,"Good movie, but i prefer a regular blu-ray case","I like the movie, but i have to take a star off for the packaging. I know its just a preference but i don't like blu-ray book packaging. I ended up getting the matrix boxed set which is a better deal if you want all 3 movies, Gave this one away to a friend."
4,Cool Effects,"Everyone who enjoys action flicks should see this movie in blu ray. It makes a world of difference and is very cool. Matrix 2 and 3 are pretty lame, but the first was innovative and technologically fascinating."
5,Good Product,This awesome movie with the slow motion fight scenes started a new fight phase of this century. Product is an awesome item. Great movie. Think beyond what you see.
4,The One with The Gun,"One of my favorite sci-fi movies ever. The Matrix puts the 'I' in sci-fi, in my opinion, that is. Keanu Reeves is one awesome actor. The thing I like the most about this movie is the adventure. Even though they don't really go anywhere, I like how they've been through like a lot of stuff, and the music keeps the intensity and suspense in the movie, and is able to show you exactly what's going on. I also love how smoothly they take one half of the movie and make it a scientific explanation for what's going on and all that, and the other half with action. They are able to fit it all in and make it one awesome movie."
1,5 Stars - You've got to be kidding!,"The only reason I gave it 1 star was because 0 was not an option. I love SciFi as long as there is at least an element of believability in it, but The Matrix had a lousy plot, no semblance of reality or possibility, and completely boring. One would have to be totally wasted to enjoy this movie. The highlight of the movie was the credits signifying the end of this sorry movie. Don't waste your time!"
2,"Good idea, but doesn't deliver","At the base of this film is the simple concept that everything around us is a computerized hologram (aka The Matrix), masking a less-than-ideal real world. It's an idea I too have thought would make a good movie, as I'm sure a lot of other people have. It's not too difficult of a concept.But the movie keeps explaining it. And explaining it. And explaining it. Over and over. Apparently they think the viewers are very very slow. I was sitting in the theater thinking ""Okay, I get it! Move on!"" and then they continued explaining it for about another hour. Keanu Reeves plays someone is isn't very smart because it takes an hour to explain simple things to him.And I guess it has good special effects. But I'd think any movie that relies on special effects will soon appear dated, since anyone will be able to recreate them on home computers in several years.To me, this movie seems like a good idea that didn't develop."
1,Mayebe Bill Gates Would have Been a Better Star?,"snore snore. I wanted to like this film. I was psyched for an intelligent VR themed movie. THis was NOT that movie.All I know is that the future consists of sunglass-wearing leather=clad slo-mo folk. Why they dress this way is beyond me. I guess jeans and tee shirts do not exist in the future.Oh, and those sunglass wearers was already done in the OMega Man--it was goofy there and is more goofy resurrected here.This was a sadly thought out, ill-conceived filmIf Bill Gates had been the star, it would have made it 2000% more exciting (and that is a sad commentary)Not surprisingly, most of the ""positive"" reviews have to do with the EFX. I GUESS THAT IS ALL THERE REALLY IS TO TALK ABOUT HERE.SNORE SNORE SNORE ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ"
4,Jesus in the Matrix,"One of the most compelling things about The Matrix is its biblical theme on Messianism, the belief that a particular hopeful saviour, who is usually derived from the outside world, comes and saves the world.The protagonist of this film is obviously Neo. Here, his name literally means `new,' as in a new concept or idea being formed. He resembles Jesus in being `the absolute One' that is able to perform miracles and in conflict with Thomas Anderson, the Satan in this movie.The Matrix demonstrates that the story of Jesus is still relevant in today's world. Although the real Satan may lack the black rimed sunglasses and sophisticated suit, this film is capable of showing us His miracles, teachings, and inevitable love for humanity."
4,Special Effect Evolution,"No doubt alot modern film copy matrix famous for bullet proof shoot at his 180 or 360 degreea like shot no doubt this make the movie famous for it self and top of that is the plot something very intersting. However still won;t satifst my 5 star cause it do bad acting in this one, a boring start, and is like alot of highs and lows in this one.. Not good organize but is still a charm in this one."
5,A Whole New Way Of Thinking....,"Like, way outside the box!!! I love this movie. I have watched it at least 100 times. I can believe the theory. Who are we? Where did we come from. Why are we here? Machines that run the world without our knowledge. Excellent premise for a movie. The Brothers are genius.Neo, Trinity, Morpheus....they are the newest in icons. The heros of humankind...and so misunderstood.Can not wait for RELOADED...."
5,IS WAS A GREAT MOVIE,THE MOVIE GAVE A LOT OF INSIGHT OF THE FUTURE THE BEST MOVIE THAT I SEEN SO FAR
3,Nice DVD is worth your money,I just looked at the DVD version of the Matrix. Don't get me wrong it's a great movie and the extras are worth while to watch. This movie has been a major contribute to cinematography as it exists in the world today. Then why just three stars? Because I was fairly dissapointed about the picture quality. But oke. It's not too bad and the movie is a great trip!
4,"It was em em em, I can't find the right words to describe it","I am actually giving the movie a 4 1/2 rating simply because I think the end of the movie could have been done better, else, it was the greatest sci-fi movie that I have seen, and I dare say, better than Star Wars Phantom Menace. The only other movie that left me in awe ever since The Matrix is Sixth Sense. You really gotta see this movie to believe it. Infact, it is the only DVD I am ever going to buy instead of renting."
5,Don't THINK you are...KNOW you are.,This isn't another geeky science fiction movie like star track or whatever. This movie is PHAT no mattter what. Everyone be talking bout this movie! For real if you haven't seen this movie then just go rent it. It's not that big of a deal to rent it. I think...no I know you will be surprised how tight this movie is.
3,"Great Movie, poor DVD transfer.",As pleased as I was to see Matrix released on DVD I was chagrined to see the trailer was not included as well as the poor menuing system. Compounding all this is a whithering compression ratio - where visual binary info travels across the screen one cannot fail to notice artifacting.
5,"""The Matrix"" DVD could possibly get you evicted","""The Matrix"" DVD brings home the visual and audio adrenaline rush of what, in my opinion has been the best Sci Fi offering in recent memory. This DVD is a must have for any collection. The translation to disc is flawless, the colors are crisp and the sound, for those of you with surround sound, could very well get you evicted from your apt.,or At the least provoke a few knocks on the floor from the neighbor below you. There really isn't much more to say, other than there was no better action/sci fi movie this year, and most likely no better DVD out this year. Bottom line, get it, period."
5,Truly a great special effects display!,"Matrix and Revisited are spectacular special fx. You won't be disappointed. This is edge of your seat spectacular. The plot is good, too. I've watched this multiple times. I liked the way Hollywood producers--the Wachowski brothers--went to great lengths of working out the effects with the best of comic makers--Anime.Loved this movie and the first sequel I gave them as gifts to various family members. None were disappointed. Highly recommended"
5,Amazing,"I first saw this on VHS. THen my friend rented it (On DVD) and we watched it. This movie can be confusing. But after the 5th time, you'll understand. The bullet trails are neat. And the Lobby Scene is the best shootout in years. overall, GET This movie."
5,matrix,one of the best movies ive seen the effects were great so was the story line i think everyone would like it
2,"Great Effects, absolutely silly story","My favorite reviews here are the ones that go something like:""So, like, it made me think or something about, like, what is reality? This movie is so real because, like, you never know, you know. And there's all these computers and stuff?""Dude! You are soooo right!Worst script ever? Quite possibly. Extremely flat character development. Naive premises. Non-stop nonsequiturs. PokeMon for growed-ups: make the plot so tangled and arcane that the viewer is so fill with a sense of accomplishment simply by being able to follow the plot hierarchy that they never notice that it goes... nowhere.PokeMon!"
2,"Fast-paced, cliche-ridden ride","I won't deny it: I enjoyed the Matrix. It's a fun film. It's got great special effects, quick pacing, and a compelling story-line. In the end, though, it's nothing more than a fast-paced action flick with high production values but no substance or meaning, wooden acting, and a lack of original ideas. The story is stylish but cliched: A dystopian future run by machines, the search for a prophecided messiah, a ragged band of rebels fighting against the system, reality as a work of fiction, the choice between an idyllic life in slavery or a tortuous life in freedom--we've seen all of these before, just never with so many guns and black coats.The special effects are great, the action is quick-paced, and the story is fun to follow, but that's about as deep as this movie gets. It is an expensive, mindless blockbuster, hardly the beginning of a brilliant, inspired mythology for the new millenium."
2,I'll be hated for writing this!,"At a time when Hong Kong has forgotten what made their films great, Hollywood thought they'd try to remind them with The Matrix. Anyone who's seen Iceman Cometh, Dragon From Russia, Saviour of the Soul or countless other Hong Kong classics will be able to pick out scenes re-created in The Matrix. One of the kings of Hong Kong, Yuen Woo Ping, does a good job with the action and the effects are excellent. However, what the film lacks is the real core that made films like Saviour of the Soul great. The mixture of humour, action, suspense and romance simply doesn't click in The Matrix. Everyone is applauding Carrie Ann Moss's character, but Michelle Yeoh combined fighting ability and femininity far better in Royal Warriors or Project S. The Matrix is visually terrific, but as cold as ice."
2,Looks good but no people,"This flick is all computerized special effects and characters who are as bloodless as the computers. That is, the effects are fun but the people are of little concern, since they have no reality -- being involved instead with leaping great distances through the air, walking on walls, and dodging bullets. The plot seems to involve the premise that everyboy has been created or controlled by a computer somewhere. The principals, who may be human beings, lie about hooked up to a computer aboard some sort of vehicle. What we see on the screen appears to be what's going on in their brains. Then there are other human-like creatures trying to hunt them down. Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburn sort all this out."
5,Topshelf Techno-Thriller,"For Tech junkies across this land THE MATRIX has certainly moved to the front of the pack! Superb FX,s and a ultra-cool storyline,anyone wanting to start a library should start their collection with this one."
4,started of genuis ended with generic action movie.,The first half of this movie reminded me of Dark City except the concept was a little darker but the actual sets were brighter. The first half was amazing and mind-boggling. But then they grab the guns and shoot at each other the rest of the movie. Really I think they really could have done a better job with a more intelligent ending to the movie. But it probaly wouldn't have made half the money. It's still worth seeing for the first half though.
5,The best action movie with the best special effects ever.,"The Matrix has an intricate, detailed, and intriguing plot. I enjoyed every minute of it from the first scene with ""badass"" Trinity to the final scene where Neo is ""The One."" What a great movie, my friends and I are always imitating moves from the Kung Fu scene where Neo fights Morpheus, and sometimes even trying to dodge bullets fired from a foam dart gun. When this movie comes out on VHS I am totally buying it and watching it every night until I can do every kick-ass move ever seen."
5,SUPER BESTIAL IMPRESIONANTE IMPERDIBLE,"Si vos pensabas, qu lo viste todo ,olvidate .... TENES que ver The Matrix ..YA !!!! Totalmente sorprendente, con un guion de la ostia !!! Y para colmo Keanu reeves se trabaja TODO !! , y tambien podes descubrir a una minita que se la banca .. Carrie Anne Moss ... que da de patadas y piñas a cuanto yuta se le cruza .!!! COMPRALA YAAA !!!!!!!!! Para mi 10 estrellas . Srz (superman)"
3,The Matrix,I debated on watching The Matrix because this type of movie usually does not appeal to me. I only heard good things and decided to give in. I hated the movie. It was too violent and the meaning was not as deep as everyone made it out to be. If you don't think you will like it you probably won't. I will stick to movies such as Notting Hill.
3,Good,This is a pretty good movie but there are a few loose ends that need to be tied. The idea of the movie was very original and brilliant. If you watch it you will be amazed at the reallity that is behind it.
5,Amazing doesn't even cover it!,"Every time I watch this movie I like it more! The effects are breathtaking, the story is mindbogglingly good, the fight scenes are incredible - One of the few special effects movies I've seen where the effects enhance the story and never take away from it. It even has the worst actor of his generation and is still one of the best movies! If you've never seen it you've really missed out! Rent it immediatly!!!"
5,The Matrix,I think the movie was created by geniuses because of the digital animation the movie had to use and because it was a mix of si-fi and action.From watching the making of the Matrix on the DVD I think that the directors chose the right charachters for the job.The movie was a spectacular way of using computers and kun-foo in one. It was EYE-POPING Spectacular.
2,MY FAVORITE SCI-FICTION NOT LIKE THIS,"The contents and performances of this movie are more alike animation than most other sci-fiction movies. It contains too many inconvincible concepts involved with the whole story, the actors' acting are plain and it is pale comparision to other good sci-fiction movies which contain good stories and actings. It will be remained on my collection shelf with dust after one time viewing ! Hey, Where is second hand shop I can sell this DVD to ?!"
5,Star what?,"Well, after 800 reviewers, my comment on this movie seems nothing, but here goes...This film is very reason why Star Wars Episode I looked very child-like movie. Matrix defined new standard for future Sci-Fi movies like Star Wars did 20 years ago.One Word--Excellent all the way."
4,Buy this DVD. It's a treasure,"The Matrix is undoubtedly one of the most innovative and enjoyable movies of this decade. With its out-of-this-world special effects and amazing sets and of course the splendid cast, the movie is easily enrolled into the sci-fi hall of fame with classics like Blade Runner and Terminator. The Matrix will be a model for future sci-fi flicks."
5,My sentiments exactly.,I love anything that has Pavarotti in it. You just can not go wrong buying anything about this robust man.
3,Very useful for costuming ideas,"I bought this book with the expectation that it would cover all of Renaissance Europe and not just the usual area of focus for this subject (i.e. Elizabethan England). However, to my disappointment at least half the book concentrated on Italian costuming, which in retrospect is to be expected, since the author was Italian! The author definitely focuses on middle to upper-class clothing and will not be helpful to someone who may be looking for lower class clothing.However, in general, the woodcuts are exquisite and the organization is very easy to use. It is certainly a 'must have' for anyone looking for historical pictures of Renaissance period clothing, written by someone who was a contemporary of the time."
4,A good source for period-accurate16th Italian/Venetian fashion,"Despite what some may tell you, this is actually a VERY good source for late 16th century Venetian, and to a lesser extent Italian, costume, especially if studied in conjuction with a study of the portraits of the period. Vecellio was a Venetian born and bred, and also had first hand knowledge of Italian fashions outside of Venice. However, any costume depiction in this book that is of costume outside of Venice or Italy should be taken with a grain of salt."
2,I was disappointed,"I have enjoyed the other two Shakespeare books by this author, but this one began to delve into the occult with fortune telling. Because of that I cannot recommned this for anyone who had convictions against such things. I am writing this to warn others who share the same conviction so they won't waster their money."
5,Mostly Murder by Sir Sydney Smith,"In this book, the famous British Forensic Pathologist Dr. Sydney Smith narrates with a distinct Scottish charm and in factual manner the way he solved several noteworthy crimes committed in England and in some of its Colonies using his knowledge of Forensic Pathology during the mid 20th Century. Often, he would identify a murderer from a few bones as was once found in a dry well in Egypt where he established in Cairo, its first Forensic Pathology Laboratory. He gives the reader a glimpse of the court-room drama that attorney, Sir Bernard Spilsbury, for the Prosecution and Defence alternatively and Sydney Smith himself opposing Spilsbury produced in the courts of law in Britain. Several B&W photographs add greatly to the narrative of each solved case."
3,Didn't tell you,"I just ordered this product and when I got it it was just a voucher with questions about the make and model of the keyboard and then you had to mail it back. In no way did they tell you , you had to fill out a form mail it back then wait a week. I haven't ordered the product yet as I'm waiting on my new keyboard, but it's just a big hassle to have to do all that they should have informed you. Other than that we'll see."
1,purchase refunded,"Unfortunately they do not make a cover for my keyboard (Saitek Eclipse II), I was issued a full refund without delay I only put one star due to fact I had to put something but one cannot review what I never received"
3,Spiritual depth yes; but chorus sound awful,"I have no doubt on the spiritual dimension of this recording, yet the chorus sound awful."
3,Unsure...,The size is nice but im not sold on the perch surface itself. It seems almost too rough for a birds feet which scares me that a bird might become injured if perched on these for too long. Decided to put it away and might try it out some other time.Seems well built but not sold on the material used for fear of injury.3/5
4,interesting book,"Its good reading, some new bits of history. The big mouth comediam wooed have been arrested in this lunatic Germany in 1932"
3,The Hinderber Murders,"Again, I believe this book was loosely based on truth/fiction, but good plot, good story. It did hold my interest."
2,Mixed Bag,"The style and plot were a tad simplistic. The historical accuracy was actually quite good. My biggest issue was with how ""perfect"" our protagonist is. He always knows everything, and gets away with completely unbelieveable dialog that makes the book a bit of a dog. If you are a fan of history and airships, this isn't a bad read. The author did their homework. Unfortunately, that is the apparent gimmick. Historical disaster, 2-D hero, and a cheesy plot seem to be all there is. It is amazing that an author can develop such a following with such a pat formula."
3,Gas Bag,"Max Allan Collins turns in a fast, fun adventure based on a historical catastrophe (his forte, it seems). Fans of The Saint will love what he's done here; others needn't worry about being left out, as Collins keeps the mystery crackling and the in-jokes to a minimum. An afterword by the author puts the fictionalized elements of the tale in proper historical context. Collins pulls a few neat tricks out of his mystery-writer's hat to keep you guessing until the final pages.Any chance of seeing Leslie Charteris in another adventure?"
1,POS,"This game is horrible, game play is bad, not like poker at all. What the hell is this, its ridiculous... . .."
3,"fun, but...","the game is fun and helps your game out a bit, but it is very repetitive... you can... no you will get sick of the catch phrases that the characters say... dont get me wrong though, you can always turn down the sound to the tv, turn on your stereo or head phones and it is just like your in the game..."
5,Wonderful machine,"This is a great machine! Great for tone and aerobic exercises, stores easily, and built very well. There are many attachments, along with the many exercises, so you won't get bored."
4,Some things you haven't thought of,"The book is exactly what it says it is: 101 Ways to Massively Increase the Value of Your Real Estate. The author, Dolf de Roos, isn't trying to fool anyone. The format is clean and easy to read and provides good, solid ideas to apply to your own home or investment property.Well worth a look."
5,simple yet smart,a Very beginner book with great realistic ideas of how to update your property to get the most bang for your buck. I would recommend the other books of DOLF DE ROOS as well. check out his cd audio sets.
3,pretty cute book,pretty cute book. but these days you could read this kind of stuff on website. i like dolf though and :-) he uses other people's idea and not lift a finger to publish this book. smart move!
1,Disappointing,"Is that all???? Felt book was waste of money. Few pages and 101 ""ways"" were common sense ways such as improve landscaping, add carport/garage, paint house, brighten up rooms, etc. Disappointing."
1,101 Ways to Massively Increase the Value of Your Real Estate without Spending Much Money,Attention: Seasoned RealEstate investers don't waste your time purchasing this book. Ideal for amatuer investors who want to add more value to their piece of real estate.
1,De Roos' Book Bombs,Need I say more? This book just doesn't have what it takes. It lacks innovative and new ideas on how to improve the value of property. These are ideas that have long before been thought up in many previous real estate books. Move on to a better book.
3,"some new ideas, but not much","Most of the ideas in here you probably already know: add on a garage, paint the house, etc. There are a few new ideas in here, but not enough to justify the price. Is de Roos just trying to make a profit? I think so. Move on and find a better book that has more unique ideas."
1,An Awful and Poorly Written Book,"This is another MONEY MAKER for Dolf de Roos. Dolf charges over $2000 and more for his seminars! This is the reason he can afford his NICE Cars, Fancy Houses, and Extraordinary Travels. You do in fact need MONEY to Make Money. You also need MONEY to Increase the Value of Your Real Estate. But this is not an issue for the author of this book, because of his Seminar and Book Sales. This is one Author of which I do not have respect for. He does not practice what he preaches. Dolf is only RICH because of his Seminars. Not because of Real Estate. Please read a book by someone who actually knows how to invest in Real Estate. Not someone who knows how to Sell Seminars and Books."
1,lame...,"this book is full of useless ideas, good ideas, yes, but common sense...not worth the money..."
5,Excellent,"Excellent book, would highly recommend. I find the other review to be completely off, I'm sure the research and fact-finding was done while this book was being prepared-- there are always differences on how history can be interpreted, and I appreciate this perspective."
1,Incredibly inacurate book full of factual mistakes,"Being one of Tesla's great admirers because he enlightened 20th century and helped all mankind to get rid of hard work (machines now doing lots of work thanks to Tesla), I don't think this grossly inaccurate book makes him or us readers any favors. Factual error on almost every page is really little bit too much - so much that it becomes great fun to read and laugh if only it is not so sad that someone can actually produce such a book. In conclusion tragicomic, pity that it involves Tesla as he and his great work does not deserve such a cheap and illiterate approach. Maybe the author should try with some other characters where accuracy is not so important, like Donald Duck for example."
3,Great pool! Terrible filter!,"Love the pool. Filter no way is powerful enough for this pool and this is the smallest one the company makes. The pool construction is great! I understand this is the same model filter that comes with the larger Intex pools as well. Mine is so small that I opt to drain the pool when it gets really dirty, but with a larger model that may not be an option. Intex u are making a killing out there, give the people a better filter!"
2,Spend the extra twenty bucks and get the Champ!,"My wife gave me this a while back, and I never had a successful flight. It's hard enough learning to fly without ailerons. This model will set you back even further with a non-conventional rudder/elevator hybrid, and a rear-mounted propeller that may be better for crashes (questionable), but simply isn't the way most planes are configured. Fixing the control strings when the tail got smashed was too much for me, and I sadly threw it away. Then I read about the RTF Champ, which sells for $90, and is made by the same company. Fantastic plane to learn with. I've crashed it dozens of times with no substantial damage. True, no ailerons, but I've mastered the plane and am ready to move on."
2,Poor control,"The Firebird Commander is a sturdy plane, but is hard to control. The V-tail acts as both rudder and elevator, but provides little control. I had to modify and extend the V-tail to provide more control surface. Out of the box, the turning radius was probably about 200 feet.The climb rate was less than desired and the plane should probably have a more powerful motor.This is a beginners airplane, but there are other models that might be more suitable for a beginner, not the Firebird Commander."
1,Worst plane ever!!,"The flight characteristics regarding this plane are the worst I have seen! Out of the box it would not fly, it will roll left no matter what input you give it to counteract it. I have tried to trim it and to make sure all flight surfaces are level and even.The lack of separate elevator and rudder control makes this a poor choice for any pilot. I will stick to more of a true rudder and elevator input system! The durability should be good, IF you can get it into the air."
1,Worse product ever bought,3rd time out the skins on the wings separated and flew into the propellar. Plane dove to the ground and can't be flown. Can't get any kind of response from the manufacturer on a replacement. Don't buy this junk plane!
1,crap,this toy does not work at all i couldn't even get mine off the ground before the propeller and the fuseledge door broke. it is not worth the plasting its made out of. dont buy this peice of garbage.
3,The writing menu review,This publication had many good ideas.however I am a middle school teacher and found the ideas mostly for primary and elementary age students. The concept of student choice and points awarded I thought would be very motivating to students.
4,Evolution,"The very first song I heard from The Zutons was ""You Will You Won't"" from ""Who Killed The Zutons?"". I remember thinking 'these guys are nuts'. Yes, it was love at first listen. I have truly enjoyed that album and eagerly awaited the release of ""Tired Of Hanging Around"". I am happy to say it was worth the wait. The Zutons have grown, changed, evolved and managed to do so without losing their heart or humor. What's the point in releasing a new album if it sounds exactly like the last one? Right? Among the more notable tracks are ""It's The Little Things We Do"" and ""You've Got A Friend In Me"". The former is about a hangover and the latter is apparently a stalker. The entire album is wonderful, but those two songs stood out for me. Definately worth a listen or two or three..."
5,Head 120 gram racquet,"Wonderful racquet, Powerful, light as a feather, tough. My favorite after 52 years of playing the game."
2,Light but fragile,I know several intermediate to good players who owned it. It never lasted more than several months. Too fragile!
1,Waste of Time and Money,"This book was such a waste. One of the french folds reads, ""...to act as a visual catalyst in the creation and production of exciting and innovative packaging design.""There is NOTHING INNOVATIVE or EXCITING about this book. And as far as I am concerned the included cd is mearly cheating. No self respecting designer would stock this book on their shelf.A REAL investment book, which contains all of the patterns in this book as well as hundreds more, would be ""The Packaging Designer's Book of Patterns"" by Roth & Wybenga.How do I return the book if i hastily trashed the carton en route from the post office? or am i stranded with this piece of garbage forever."
4,untitled,Be alone and powerfull. Don't stop with the word and with being human. Belong with the terrible forces of nature. Listen to Wolfsheim.
5,Fantastic Baseball Story,"So much better than the movie! Shoeless Joe is a wonderful story about family, following your dreams, baseball, and what happens when your fantasy becomes reality. Highly recommended!"
4,This book is perfect for baseball lovers.,I liked this book because I am a baseball lover. It is the base for the movie Field of Dreams. So if you haven't seen the movie read the book. Please if you read this review and you are a baseball lover buy and read this book.
1,DO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT READING THIS BOOK,"I HAD TO READ THIS BOOK FOR HIGH SCHOOL, IT IS THE WORST BOOK I EVER READ. ON EVERY PAGE THERE IS A SIMALE OR METAPHOR, IT JUST GETS SO REPETITIVE, AND THE PLOT IS JUST SO BORING AND POINTLESS. I JUST WONDER WAS THE AUTHOR DRUNK WHEN HE WROTE THIS PIECE OF GAARBAGE"
4,A rare occurence where the book and the movie are both excellent for separate reasons,"If you're like me, reading Shoeless Joe by W. P. Kinsella for the first time after being a long time fan of the movie, then you're in for a treat. Of course, if you expect it to read like a novelization of Field of Dreams, then you'll be disappointed.The story is a deliberate and passionate journey of a man following a crazy voice in his head to build a baseball field in place of the crops on his Iowa farm. He risks his family's livelihood for the sake of a dream, and because he loves his wife, daughter, Iowa and baseball. The writing is leisurely as if stretching back across the 20th century from the very time of Shoeless Joe Jackson. Give yourself time to get enveloped in this one."
3,potential,"Like most, I saw the movie prior, and it is one of my all-time favorites.On the positive side, the book is very well-written, semi-deep, and resembles the movie enough to make it interesting and definitely not boring, as others somehow found.On the negative side, it's 50-100 pages too long and very preachy. Kinsella (author & main character) is clearly a Marxist who hates religion, ordinary folks and businessmen. He is so condescending in some of his cliche and naive commentaries on religion and his wife's family. This detracted from the book big time. It is a fiction book, after all!Also, one person noted ""It seemed like every other word was a figure of speech.""True. And while, as a writer, I appreciate some of this, I can see how having myriad similes and analogies can also be irksome.The book could have been better. It's rare for me to admit this, but stick to the movie."
2,Almost mad!,I thought I ordered a paperback novel!!! What I got was a book on cassette tape. The box is in very rough shape. The reason I give it 2 stars is I just happen to have an older car that has a working cassette player in it.
3,Good even if you aren't a baseball fan,"""Shoeless Joe"" was the basis for the 1989 movie ""Field of Dreams"". I'm sure my book review is a bit tainted since I saw the movie again last year with my family. It almost felt like the book started too fast with the mysterious voice, and it was hard for me to recapture the mystique and awe that the movie voice inspired whenever it gave directions to Ray.I did enjoy the book, and it introduced me to some characters that weren't in the movie such as Eddie ""Kid"" Scissons, and Ray's twin brother Richard. I thought these characters added a little more to the overall story.I highly recommend the book to anyone that loves the game of baseball. There is a speech from Kid Scissons that puts baseball on par with religion, and I believe that is probably true for some diehard fans of the game."
4,You don't have to be a baseball fan to enjoy this book,"You don't have to be a baseball fan to enjoy this book, and like many of the best sports stories this really isn't about the sport as much as it is about family, dreams, America, and what really matters in life. The book is a bit different from the movie (Field of Dreams), as expected, but is still close enough so that it adds something to fans of the film.Someone commented that this book is read by high school and college students, but really is best enjoyed by some older, with more life experience. I have to agree, but do think most will still enjoy this book."
5,Crazy about Baseball in Iowa,"Shoeless Joe by W.P. Kinsella is an inspiring story of Ray Kinsella, a not-so-typical farmer from Iowa who just loves baseball. One day while he's out in his cornfield, he hears the voice of a baseball announcer say, ""If you build it, he will come."" Like a vision from a crystal ball, he realises and sees that ""he"" is Shoeless Joe Jackson, and ""it"" is a baseball field. Although he's called crazy by the rest of the town, his daughter and wife stand beside him. The voice, and Shoeless Joe keep him motivated as they lead him on a journey all across USA to fufill his dreams.Shoeless Joe is a beautifully written story about going for your dreams, the American way, and remembering true values of life. It's a great book, and it's truly inspiring. I recommend you to BUY BUY BUY!"
3,Magnificent Story Poorly Told,"To be honest, Kinsella could have done much better with the wonderful story he had to work with. Some characters seem to have no purpose in this story(especially Eddie Scissons. Give credit to the movie Field of Dreams for leaving him out.) A true baseball fan like myself will appreciate the story and underlying meaning, but lovers lf the movie will be disappointed. There are better books to read in the world."
1,English Teacher Overwhelmed by Similes,"I absolutely loved the movie ""Field of Dreams"" which was based on ""Shoeless Joe"" by Kinsella. However, I must strongly urge you to NOT buy the ""books on tape"" and book version. I was very disappointed when I put my disc into my car's player. The narrator's voice is abrasive and creepy. Also, the book and the disc versions contain way too many similes. It seemed like every other word was a figure of speech. Give the reader/listener some credit. I don't need to be told ""the pavement was as hot as a breakfast griddle."""
3,Summer Reading,"My son read this for a summer reading project. He had very high expectations, but he did not feel it was as good as he thought it would be."
2,I Don't Understand What He Trying To Say........,"I have to read it for my High School, and write a report about it. Even though I read it 3 times but I still don't understand what is he trying to tell me and what is he talking about. I just feel it is so FAKE....well it is Fiction after all."
1,"""Shoeless Joe"" had hard time staying interesting","Like many of the people here, I too had to read this novel for school. Never seeing the movie ""Field of dreams"", I didn't go into it already knowing the ending.'Shoeless Joe' starts off like most novels, kinda slow. Unfortunally this makes the reader think that it will soon start to pick up and become an interesting novel. This is not so. The story drags on yanking the reader in different pointless directions. I have a book report due for this book tomorrow, and I'm only 3/4 way through the book. I have lost interest in it and have only made it as far as I have because we have to read it some days in engilsh class. Even then I have a hard time keeping my attention pointed to the novel. I always thought keeping the reader interested was a large part of writing a good novel, apparently I was wrong."
1,Crap,"What a disappointment. You know a book is bad when the movie is actually better than it -- light years better, actually. Whoever wrote the screenplay took the few good ideas in the book and focused on them. They also kept some of the poetic / purple dialog. Just enough to not overdo it. The book overdoes everything. When compared with the movie script, it reads like a rough draft. The nerve to put J.D. Salinger in it. Like he should ever be associated with such low-grade art. Treasure the movie, don't bother with the book."
3,Watch the movie instead,"It's not often that one reads a book and then is more pleased with the flick, but this is one of those times. I can't slam this book, because it spawned one of the favorite films, ""Field of Dreams,"" but the incessant comparisons of baseball to religion were annoying, and the whole subplot of Ray's twin brother in the book was thankfully snipped out of the film. One neat point is the connection between Ray and J.D. Salinger. It's not a bad read, by any means, but it doesn't compare to the film."
3,NO MATTER WHAT---THERE'LL ALWAYS BE BASEBALL!!,"""""FIELD OF DREAMS"""" IS ONE OF MY ALL-TIME FAVORITE MOVIES EVER---EVER.THIS BOOK WAS JUST OKAY---DIFFERENT FROM THE MOVIES IN SOME WAYS.I'M GLAD I READ IT--THANK YOU.P.S. IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN ON MY """"BUCKET LIST"""" TO GO TO IOWAAND VISIT THE """"REAL""""--FIELD OF DREAMS---SOME DAY---SOME DAY.NO MATTER WHAT---THERE'LL ALWAYS BE BASEBALL!!"
4,"Entertaining, but over the top","A must read if you liked Field of Dreams, the novel Shoeless Joe is actually a bit more complex and has additional characters. The premise of the novel is brilliant and outrageous, that Shoeless Joe Jackson comes to life when an Iowa farmer/baseball fanatic is given a mysterious directive to build a field for him, and the plot development is highly entertaining. The only drawback for me is that the prose sometimes goes over the top and gets almost psuedo-lyrical, and also the attempt to equate baseball with life is a bit overdone, but that said the book really is a lot of fun and well done."
5,Beautiful pics of beautiful planes!,"Brief but good descriptions - but the pics are great! If you are an aviation fan, this book is a must, especially at the bargain price - mine was just $3.50 from an Amazon seller and is like new!"
5,Beautiful,Love the cello and orchestra in this CD. She is certainly a master at the instrument. I suggest headphones so you can REALLY her the string work.
4,A sassy dame,"I love this CD. It came extremely fast to NZ and a bonus too as I was expecting only one cd not three!While Dvorak is currently my favourite, other composers featured here have been growing on me.Never been a Cello devotee in the past, but I am enjoying this new phase of my musical listening.The late Ms du Pre plays with vigor and assertiveness, yet manages to convey those moving and sublime moments when needed.Most enjoyable. Thanky you"
5,"I THOUGHT I had heard these concertos,,,","UNTIL I was fortunate enough to have heard them performed by Jacqueline du Pre!!!ABSOLUTELY STUNNING!!! Her superb playing, along with truly masterfulinterpretative skills, just ""comes pouring out of the speakers!""Also, the orchestras were obviously truly inspired by these opportunities to perform and record with one of the greatest musicians of all time.The sound quality is excellent, as is the separation and clarity of both the soloist's and orchestral performances. The overall dynanism is also top notch - I found I had to lower the volume substantially from my normalsystem loudness levels.I've enjoyed this set so much I'll probably wind up buying everything from Amazon that EMI has produced with Jacqueline du Pre's name on it!"
5,Love the book,Without a doubt one of the best non-religious books on life I've ever read. I could not say enough good about the book and its author's perspectives. I log a lot of hours at work and struggle to find a balance. The book is brilliant with life changing concepts and ideas. It changed my perspective and I've told many friends and family about it. Worth your time to read and reread!!! Every business professional who lives at work or works too much should read and make needed changes in their lives.Mike S.[...]
5,unmissable stuff,"How lucky we are that Daniel Barenboim began to mature as a great artist with Klemperer enjoying a glorious Indian summer. This is a miraculous recording. The 24-year-old Barenboim is a match for the magisterial Klemperer, who was almost three times the age of his precocious pianist. It's remarkable to find two artists of such different ages cooperating so well. And they're fully equals as well - this is a version of the Beethoven concertos with soloist as primus inter pares (to quote one reviewer). The Emperor has seldom sounded so grand. The orchestral playing is quite something as well."
1,Why?,"In response to another poster, the pre-release criticism not really about what is or is not on this disc. It's about the fact that studios want to milk the audience dry by re-issuing every DVD with new special features every few years. A movie comes out on DVD, people who liked the movie shell out money to own it. Fine. Then the studio comes along, throws in a few special features, re-issues the DVD, and expect people to buy it up too. Not just people who didn't own the original DVD, but those who did as well. And this time, not only have they done that once, they've done it twice! Put all the cards on the table; put all the special features on the first release, and then leave it alone. Stop trying to get the audience to pay for the same movie over and over. It's not just a question of what may be on this DVD, it's a question of why wasn't this all on there the first time. Why does this one need to be released three times, and when will it stop?"
4,Wish I'd read everyone's reviews before buying!,"I love this movie, but I am disappointed that there are all these scenes in the DVD that were not in the original movie. The scenes are not added features -- they are just part of the movie, so you can't wathc the movie without them. The additional scenes are OK, but they add little to the great original movie. There's a reason why those scenes were cut in the first place!"
1,When did prostitution become adorable?,"With all the ""careers"" they could have used for Julia Roberts in this film, why was prostitution the first choice?She could have been the desk clerk, a cab driver, the cashier in a book store, a chef in the hotel kitchen, a nanny, a manicurist, the president of the damn bank across the street... anything, anything, anything but a hooker! What is romantic about VD, rape, jail time, pimps, etc?What does this film say about relationships between men and women? I know this is a popular film, and that scares me even more. A big studio put big money into this, and it tells me all I need to know about their attitudes."
3,Not As Great As People Say,"I saw this movie on Tv because I'm only 13 and at the time I was 12 and my mom didnt want me to see all of it. Now my WHOLE ENTIRE family is obsessed with this movie and whenever all the women get together we always end up watching it. It was good, but very predictable.....not that that makes it bad, but I thought it was going to be this brilliant work of art. But it wasnt. It was good and most people will like it, but its not that great."
3,Pretty Woman 15th year Anniversary Edition,The movie was great! The shipping time was appropriate. The movie was shipped in a thin plastic mailing bag and the case was smashed in many pieces. There was not a written brochure inside the case (that was shown on line). I requested a replacement but received $1.50 refund for the case instead. Unless they would change their packaging method I probably would not purchase from this seller again. But the movie was great!
2,Please Don't Make Me Watch This Movie Again,"Let me start by saying I don't demand utter reality in my movies. I'm happy to suspend my disbelief in the name of entertainment. The problem is that I think I pulled something having to suspend so MUCH disbelief for so long. If you're a sucker for any kind of romantic movie you will enjoy this movie. Everyone does their best. My issue is that there are so many superior movies of the ""happily ever after"" genre that you could go your whole life without seeing ""Pretty Woman."" Try something more creative like ""The Night We Never Met"" or even ""You've Got Mail"" where character development and plot are given much more work."
1,morally bankrupt,"Who could possibly like a movie whose lesson is: ""happiness is having some guy give you free access to his credit cards""? Everyone complains about the lack of family values on TV, but what message could be worse than ""shopping is happiness, and love is having someone pay you to be with them""? yuck"
1,Typical Hollywood nonsense,"Very realistic portrayal of a typical streetwalker,excect of course sans std's,needle tracks up and down both arms,psychological problems,30 extra pounds courtesy of 4 pregnancies, and of course many prostitutes look like JR."
1,There's no way in hell that this movie is getting near my house.,"As one of the masses who just loved looking at Julia Roberts' pretty in this film, I always knew the story was toxic and not at all sane. Unfortunately, most of her movies are unhealthy and her characters make bad choices but she sells it. So she has a really good movie due her."
1,"Julia Roberts,a Pretty woman? Not a chance","Can someone please tell me how jojo the dog faced boy (julia roberts) was cast in the role of Pretty woman? If it was pretty ugly woman, that I would understand."
1,Pretty Woman,"I did not receive the item purchased. This is the response I received when I inquired about the purchase. To Whom It May Concern:I refund the cost of the dvd to over a month ago before I was out of stock.* 1 of Pretty WomanArthurI will check my credit card for this refund, however, at this time, to the best of my knowledge I haven't seen the refund."
5,best robert's movie ever,This was the best of the best. I love julia roberts in almost everything she has made but by far this has been her best movie yet. Like afairy tale come true. I think we would all like to think life could turn out this way for us. Great movie go Julia.
4,Boy was I supprised,I never really looked at this movie until I got it on DVD for my girlfriend. Nice story and good acting. The added background info about the production of the movie is cool.
4,great movie,This is a great movie. Both my daughter and I really enjoyed this movie. She still watches it all the time.
1,HD source is low def,"The movie production is a 5 starThe source material that was provided to Amazon to be streamed as HD was VHS quality.This is not due to band-width limits.I called Amazon and they are looking into this.Amazon gets high marks for customer service for responding to this.They refunded my purchase cost, (and I did not even ask).They promised to give a good honest look at this case.Kuddos to Amazon.But until the source quality is addressed, you will be looking at SD quality in SD"
1,Unimpressed,This movie didnt work once I received it. I waited a few weeks to receive it and after I did it wouldn't play in any DVD player that I had inside the house. I didn't pay much for the item but was still very disappointed!!
2,Not much to write home about,Somehow it seemed so much better when it first came out. I found it dull this time. It may be a one trick pony.
3,not the original,"For anyone who simply wants to know if this is the original theatrical version, like myself--it's not. It's the same as the 10th Anniversary Edition, with the stuff from the cutting room floor thrown back into the movie, instead of in Bonus Features where it belongs. I'm so thankful I still have the oringinal release that I love on video."
1,"Don't Waste Your Time, Buy the Regular Version","The orginal release is a well-edited movie filled with some excellent sub-themes of self-worth, self-image, true selfless love versus lust, as well as a great visual lesson on real friendship versus friendship built on using someone for personal gain (the two prostitues vs. the billioniare and his lawyer).I rate the original movie five stars. However, this new edition is a GREAT disappointment. The additional scenes do not even match in lighting, etc. and create a poorly edited version of a great story. The 'extra features' are sloppy and seem just tossed in to 'add value'. I'm guessing the studio did not want to spend the extra money to get the cast to sit down and do some meaningful interviews.SAVE YOUR MONEY! Buy the orginal version on DVD or Video."
2,Had Difficulty Liking This One,"Totally ridiculous story line. Unbelievible at best. Though I liked her new clothes. Quite fashionable. Probably my dislike of Richard Gere has something to do with my negative reaction. It got better rewatching it on a cold, rainy afternoon. But not much, only bearable. This one seems to be a man's movie. All the men I know liked it. Some even cried at the end. Go figure!"
2,poor,"When a movie this bad does as well as it did, it boggles the mind. It shows the cream does not rise to the top, because Eric Roberts is a brilliant, charismatic actor, but it was his bland bland sister Julia who became the movie star of their family with this film. I read that after seeing this movie, girls from around the world flew into L.A. to try prostitution in order to marry a billionaire! I hope that isn't true. But it's people dumb enough to do that who would be dumb enough to like this movie."
5,MOVIE OF THE CENTURY -NO DOUBT,"Frankly,any human who dosen't like Pretty Woman has no heart.Belive it or not when this movie was first released in the theaters,I saw it 8 times! Now of course I have it's video,and I watch the movie anytime I am depressed.I like everything about the movie.Really ,make the effort to see the movie atleast once in your lifetime.If you don't then you are really missing something."
5,Great Romantic Comedy,"This is a movie about a fantasy life, one all girls dream of! Not a reality based rendition! But fun and romantic!"
1,what a sad joke?,if this were everyday Hooker life then this would be the ultimate job.but it's a far cry from that.while Gere&Roberts have on-screen Chemistry this film is not Believable at all.fantasy is one thing but this is a real reach.
2,ZZZZZZ,This movie basically put me to sleep. It seemed like it was 4 hrs. long! I was disappointed. This is the first time I've seen this movie after all these years of hearing all positive things about it. But I guess everyone's taste is different. I laughed only a couple times. And if it wasn't for the funny couple things Julia Roberts said or did I would have only given it one star.
1,DVD Features not worth the Extra Bucks,"The alledged extra 15 minutes of footage is not any deleted scenes, just merely a camera filming the filming of one scene. There is not any sound, just the Pretty Woman theme playing in the background. I was disappointed by this DVD. I expected so much more."
1,Family Fun For All!,"What's better entertainment than the fairy tale romance of a high price prostitute with the world's biggest mouth, who meets a hampster-loving rich guy who pays her to NOT have sex with him, falls in love with her, and then offers her the world. Its like the story of Cinderella - if Cinderella were a whore, of course, and Prince Charming liked gerbils more than Cinderella."
5,Pretty Woman,It was wonderful and we really enjoyed watching it and will watch again at some point. My mother-in-law had never seen it
3,Ok,"I bought this movie for my sis in law because when this movie came out we watched it together until we had all the lines memorized. When I pulled the package out of the mailbox it rattled. Turns out the movie is ok, but the holder part for the center of the DVD was broke and everything was just floating around in the box. Not real happy about that, but it will do."
5,Modern Day Cinderella,"Actors here are Brilliant, my thumbs are way up! I can watch this film over and over again.If Disney's Cinderella are every girls dream. Pretty Woman maybe every boys dream,Why? Because when Richard Gere discovered that He's working so hard to pin down other competitors in business, at the same time his Attorney (Jason Alexander)benefits from it, Money wise.Richard decided to follow his heart and continue falling in love with the Pretty Woman. So sad, Julia Roberts is a prostitute here but a good one, she even have several colors and flavors of condoms to choose from,That's safe sex!This is a great story plot a millionaire meets his match a prostitute with a golden heart.In reality prostitutes deserves a little break. As for the Pretty Woman this is a big break, Kudos!"
5,One of My Favorite Movies!,"This movie is one of my favorite movies i own, the whole movie is well put together and has such cute parts, some really funny parts, and some emotional parts. I love this movie so much and would recommend this movie to all my friends, family and all the strangers i meet. This movie is truly great."
5,GREAT FILM,"This movie was so excellent and funny at the same time.The fact that Richard acted so calm while Julia Roberts was just as funny and naive about the life of the rich people. This is one movie that I watch over and over again, even on the cable channel. It is Cinderella kinda story but damn Cinderella in this move, Julia Roberts, was and still beautiful; Richard Gere on the other hand is handsome and acted the role very good. I recommend this movie anytime,anyday"
5,The little differences make it even better,"The DVD version only enhances this wonderfully simple but lovable movie. The extra footage adds just that little extra to an already extremely enjoyable movie. Make sure that you also listen to Garry Marshall in the director's comments. They are very worthwile and very funny. Richard Gere & Julia Roberts are perfectly matched in the enchanting comedy, but the show is stolen by the brilliant support role played by Hector Elizondo(the part kick started his career), he rounds the cast off perfectly. The bad guy is well played by Jason Alexander (pre George/Seinfeld days), he plays the Wall Street, male dominating pig with great aplomb. All in all an extremely plesant movie that is easy to watch over & over again. The DVD version just freshens the experience."
1,Modern Fairytale? PUH-LEEEEZE,I'll never understand all the praise for a movie who's basic premise seems to be as follows:A) All women are prostitutes at heart B) All women need to be rescued by rich menSounds pretty shallow to me.
1,Pretty Boring,"For ten years I avoided this until now-- I should have waited. A romantic comedy without the romance or laughs. I am not a big Roberts fan, and she is terrible here. Leave it to Hollywood in the era of AIDS and STDs to make prostitution seem glamorous, and how a hooker with a heart of gold can change one of those jerk billionaires who is ruining it for the rest of us. So much of the film took place in the hotel suite, I thought I was watching some kind of nightmarish stage play. You may not like this review, but I sure did not like this film."
1,Cinderella as prostitute. What is the message for your kid?,"It could have been a good flick if Hollywood could find another occupation for women. Women in film get a disproportionate number of careers as: 1. Prostitutes 2. Strippers 3. Porn stars.I thought there were other jobs available. The subversive message of this twisted fairy tale? Become a prostitute meet a super rich guy and live happily ever after. Great for the kids, not! Gee if he is really supportave and respectfull can she keep her job after the wedding? Right."
3,Cinderella plays hooker,"Yes, it's incredibly predictable and far to sweet for it's own good sometimes but were it not for Gere and Roberts onscreen chemistry this could have been a dismal flop or nothing too engaging. Julia Roberts portrays a girl lost on the wrong side of the Hollywood tracks, prostituting herself to earn some hard cash. Richard Gere plays the typical hokie prince charming who sees it fit to lift her out of this pavement status. While never totally believable it always seems to skirt on issues that leave it lacking the courage of its true convictions. The director had pure romantic comedy in mind here, thereby totally disregarding an underbelly that could have given the film more depth. If you like your comedy's laced with about as much cuteness and sugary sweetness as a precosious six year old then your in seventh heaven here else others may find it a mild, incredibly simplistic way of passing an evening."
1,FOOLISH !,"Is there a story more foolish than that? If I want a fairy tale, stories for children are the best and they are surely more realistic than this one which can only be defined as ''a piece of garbage''. Even the prostitutes themselves would find it insulting, as it does not reveal the truths about their lives. Sure there have got to be movies about prostitution - which is the part of the real life - and certainly the ending would not be happy at all!"
3,Theatrical Version Anywhere?,I loved Pretty Woman in the theatres and wore my original VHS tape thin. Does anyone know if the theatrical version - NOT THE DIRECTORS CUT - can be bought on DVD? I know this movie so well that the additional footage in the directors cut drives me crazy.Other than that - it's a excellent film
4,Great price but not the original version.,"I had this on DVD but I can't find it so I had to look online for a replacement. I was excited to find it on blu ray for such a great price, but be warned that this is not the original version. If you don't like removed scenes added back in then don't get this version. I wish I still had my other copy, but this one is definitely better than nothing at all!!! Love this movie! :)"
5,Pretty Modern Romantic Classic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,One of my favorite modern romantic classics and so thrilled to have this anniversary edition. Richard and Julia are at their best in this film. Their bubblebath scene is considered my most romantic in the entire film!!
1,DVD Purchase,"The dvd arrived in appropriate time frame from PB (???) It would not play. I wrote email to PB and they explained it was a ""Region 2"" dvd as stated in their ad. I do not know what that means and would not have known even if I read it. They were kind enough to give me an address to return the dvd, which I did, for a refund. I am waiting for the refund."
1,Should be called Pretty Stupid,"This movie was terrible. If there was a perfume called ""essence of fart"" then thats what this movie would smell like."
1,A message of hope for our children,"I learned so much from 'Pretty Woman'. Previously I considered prostitution to be a symptom of many of the ills in society, like loneliness, emotional neglect, addiction, inequalities in wealth and access to education, but now I know that prostitution can be fun - in this movie it's fun for the prostitute and it's fun for the client. Also, in the past, I suspected that there was more to life than money and good looks, but 'Pretty Woman' set me straight on that one: boy, was I wrong! Money is the most important thing in the world. It even makes love possible. Having been taught so many important lessons about life, I think it only fair that we, the viewing public, reward the producers and stars of this film with many millions of dollars - it might even be fair to call them prostitutes too, and to consider ourselves, the audience, as their clients."
4,Pretty Woman DVD,This movie is a great one to watch. It shows you how some people stereotype while others see you for who you are. Loved this movie!
3,Pretty Woman (15th Anniversary Special Edition),Love this movie. in good condition. wish it hadn't taken so long to get it.
1,Don't Watch Again.,"The first time I saw Pretty Woman, I thought it was great. When I saw the film again, however I was disapponted. I noticed it was poorly done and it seemed thrown hurridly together. There are editing mistakes which are noticeable, such as the breakfast scene. The movie is choppy between each scene, with no continuity. The dialogues written was also poor. The only good part of this movie is the cast- Roberts and Gere are delightful as a pair."
1,Pretty Woman DVD,"When trying to view this DVD, it wasn't compatible w/ the DVD player. A message came up on the screen saying it couldn't be read. I tried putting it in two more players, including my computer and the same message popped up. I'd like to exchange it for another DVD, same one."
3,"Great Show, DVD not so great","As much as I love this show, the DVD needs help. It's not anamorphic so widescreen TV owners beware. Although the movie format says widescreen, the DVD format isnt a true anamorphic as we'd expect.In addition, the transfer seems old and unsaturated and grainy. I would have hope for a better picture but I guess with a non anamorph DVD what could you expect."
3,Once Upon a Time Prince Charming Was a John...,"I never understood why this film was so treasured when it first came out. Until recently I didn't even own this DVD, but feel it does represent the love stories of the 90s quite well. This is nothing more than an adult version of Cinderella. It sweetens the lifestyles of hookers, making it look like a fun job until that perfect man comes and rescues her and sweeps her off her feet. Yuck! Pooey! The saving grace of this film is that it is very well acted. Julia Roberts was destined to be a star. Any other chick in this role it would have been long buried. She made the sugary crap believable. Richard Gere made a career comeback (how many can one man have?) and is perfect as the prince charming in waiting."
2,Selected B Roll Warning!!,"For those of you who love the original cut of this movie avoid this version at all costs! I received this version as a Christmas gift and I started to watch it one Saturday afternoon. One of my favorite lines was missing almost right off the bat. Instead of ""Lights, lights would be good here"" the two main characters discuss condoms and safe sex. It goes downhill from there. Some beloved scenes are just gone. This is a gritter look at Vivian Ward and her life as a prostitute. The glossed over lovable Hollywood romance now has a darker side - a side I did not like. I have seen B versions of other movies and those were OK. This was the first time that the rhythm, feel, and overal essence of a movie has been altered so dramatically. This selected B roll is a very different movie from the Pretty Woman that I know and love."
3,DVD Marshall Comments,"You all know Pretty Woman by now. If you like this movie, I do, get the DVD and listen to Gary Marshall's comments. If you know Gary Marshall at all you know he is a hoot! I laughed during the whole movie just listening to his comentary on making the movie. I my never watch this movie again with out his comentary."
3,"Great movie, if I was able to see it.","I ordered this DVD and didn't pay attention to its shipping location. It came from the U.K., and it was not able to play with our Standard U.S.A. DVD player! Uhg! I was able to make it play through my computer, after downloading a few codecs, though.Other than that, the shipping was quick, the movie's great, and have no complaints. I'll just make sure not to order ""media"" type-stuff outside the U.S.A."
1,Pretty Woman,"This DVD is no good. When I put into my DVD player it give a region error. I don't know how to send it back to the sender, because there were no packaging inside. Worst product I ever brought from amazon"
4,If Cinderella was a streetwalker.,"Pretty Woman directed by Garry Marshall is a film no one should take too seriously. Julia Roberts became a star after this film, she plays a hooker who falls in love with Edward (Richard Gere). Vivian (Roberts) lacks manners, morals, and luck but things change once Edward opens her mind to different ways of life. This film is a modern-day Cinderella story but with a twist. Pretty Woman does lack engery at times but this movie is still enjoyable to watch."
5,Ollie's Review,I Like It Because It Has Got My Fav Songs In It The Artists Are Roy Orbison And Roxette Bye!
5,a High Point in Romantic Comedy,This is a Fairy Tale of a Prostitute (Julia Roberts) and a Rich Business Man (Richard Gere) who fall in love. There it is naturally classified a romantic comedy; but the reality of it is it's so idyllic it's truly a Fairy Tale. Very Beautiful. Story all lovers of Romance must see it.
5,Pretty Woman,"Everybody loves this movie. That's why I had to have a copy. As always, Amazon provides first rate service."
4,"Good product, but should it cost $40?","I'm very satisfied with the functionality and performance of the product, but I docked one star from my rating because I don't think there's $40 of value there. With a lower price point, the product would deliver functionality and performance and value. One possible enhancement to justify the price would be a carrying pouch for the lanyard headphones. I've found I have to be careful where I carry it, if not around my neck, because the foam earphone covers can slip off, and if Apple were to provide a carrying pouch in the package, they could eliminate that issue and provide more value."
4,Great Headphones,These things are wonderful to have. I use them with me at the gym almost everyday. They keep your nano right where you want it. I thought they might be a little pricy but I'm glad I bought them.
3,too small,"This is a great product if you are small. For $40, the least they could do is include another 6-12"" of cord."
1,Crapped out after only 3 months of use!,I only used this product for 3 months and the sound wires came loose somehow inside the dongle and started sounded like the music was playing in a tin can. Crap!
5,WOW- Amazing,"Rocketman is hilarious! It's wonderful for people of all ages, not only kids! I'd reccomend it to anyone anyday."
4,"Silly, dumb fun","Love the child-like enthusiasm Williams portrays. Yes, it's got a lot of 9 yr old boy type humor, which is one of the reasons we loved it. My son laughed his head off in many spots. Even I remember lines from this movie and quote them on occasion. It's fun, and funny."
5,HI! It's me again! Hahahahaha! Whack! Whack! Whack! WakeupwakeupwakeupwakeupwakeupwakeUP!,"This entire movie is sheer genius. I despise movies that try to be stupid-funny but end up just being plain stupid (which, really, encompasses most comedies made nowadays) but this movie is one that will never stop being funny to me. Harland Williams is a comedic genius and is such a screwball, you'll be laughing non-stop the entire time. The isolation chamber scene puts me in stitches. ""JOHN JACOB JINGLEHEIMER SCHMIDT!"" ""AHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!"""
5,Stupid funny,"Yup, I gave it five stars, and yes, it is stupid. It is one of those movies you either love or hate. There isn't much I can say about the plot, etc.....let's just say the best part, for me, was when they share oxygen and one guy, well.....I don't want to give it away. This will put you on the floor! Btw, put it in your basket, and buy it when it drops to $6.49!"
5,Rocket Man!,I had looked for this video in the past and it was hard to find. To me it is a classic and good for some belly laughs. Great product and shipping! Thanks
3,Entertaining,"This movie is corny. Several times I almost turned it off at the beginning, but gave it a chance and in the end found it entertaining. Sometimes it is so silly, it becomes funny. We have watched it several times now and shared it with family and friends. Everyone has been entertained by it. The film has some crude humor, which didn't bother us, but might bother others. Otherwise, it is appropriate for family, however, I didn't like the first scene where it shows a child inside a dryer, pretending to the an astronaut and the dryer starts revolving. I really don't want my grandchildren immulating this."
4,Rocketman review,"An under-rated classic comedy. Best original comedy since Airplane. Non-stop antics that you can't leave the room for, or you'll miss a couple."
5,Hilarious!,"My family and I are not avid movie watchers, but when we first saw this movie we absolutely could not stop laughing. We rented it before buying it, and had a seven day rental - during which time we watched the movie 10 times! There is something to be said when a family that does not watch movies much, watches a single movie that many times in that brief of a time period. Watch this movie once, and you will only want to see it again and again!"
4,Hilarious,"Reordered this movie after our original was returned scratched. Some minor bathroom humor, but family friendly and funny. My five year old hasn't tried the washer scene out yet, so I believe this movie is safe for viewing by all ages."
5,Hope the Little Green Men don't see this.,"Saw clip on you tube had to have film,very clever and funny appeals to kids and adults.If you watch this and don't laugh you need surgery on your funny bone.Some of the Goldmember sketches were obviously drawn from this movie.Rocketman"
3,Incredibly underrated movie,"I was astonished when I read Leonard Maltin gave this a BOMB. RocketMan is nowhere as bad as all those critics said it was. In fact, it is quite humorous. Good family entertainment. Also, since I'm involved in an independent study about Mars, I found the movie quite amusing! Pee-wee Hermanesque too!"
4,wacky-fun-sometimes tasteless. secret addition.,"grab your popcorn bucket, your extra large iced drink, put your feet up and enjoy this wacky movie. don't tell anyone at the office. in the same vein as dumb and dumber, it's an addiction that those snobs wouldn't understand. relax, clear your mind and hit that play button, and start practicing the phrase,""It wasn't me""."
5,Lost Movie,"My daughter's boyfriend has been looking for this movie every place! He was looking for months for it in all the retail stores and gave up! I came on here and there it was....he opened it first at Christmas! His reaction was priceless!!!! ""NO WAY"""
2,2nd review sent,Nothing has changed from the first review. The product came in pieces. I guess I need to be more careful with whom I deal with.
4,Rocketman,This movie is just a funny movie. You wont grow as a person. It doesn't solve any world problem. It doesn't have a social agenda. This is just a movie you will enjoy.One criticism is that the movie does not have any chapter selection.You cant jump to a favorite part or start later in the movie.That is my only complaint.
5,The funniest movie I've seen in years.,"This movie is ia a ""must see"". If you want to laugh for a good hour to an hour and half, this is the one to get. It had me screaming "" I want my mommy""."
4,Dumb space movie but worth the $,"Yes it sounds like I am going to trash this movie.Not so fast it is cheezy it is odd it is funny.Could not Find this movie, even VHS .thank you amazon.Had DVD score."
2,"great shape and condition, but wrong zoning","the delivery was prompt and it arrived in great condition, i love this movie - my only negative was that the movie was unwatchable and had to be returned because it was a zone 2 dvd - the zoning really needs to be put in the forefront of the advert so that a buyer can look at each dvd ad and see right away which ones will be playable and not..."
3,Movie for Boys Only!,"I bought this movie for my seven year old son for Christmas. It was not his favorite movie ever. However, I loved hearing him laugh and giggle through most of the movie. My husband also chuckled a few times. My son has watched it a couple of times since, alone. My four year old daughter did not like this movie at all and I never laughed. Perfect for young boys to watch with Dad on a rainy day."
1,Sold a bootleg DVD that doesnt work in my region!,Intending to make a claim through Amazon for this. One star is too much. Too bad I can't put negative stars.
1,Amazon Sucks,I ordered Rocket Man. Nothing in the advertising indicated that the DVD provided would not be compatible with my DVD player. I have two players. I paid for the DVD plus shipping charges.Ordering DVD's is supposed to be trouble free. i do not consider having to return merchandise that is incompatible with a common DVD player to be trouble free. I qm out money and time. My time is worth something too.Crap; I might as well go to NetFlix as receive merchandise that i cannot use or enjoy.Amazon sucks!
5,Upgrade from VHS to DVD,This is such a funny movie. I had purchased it back in the mid 90's on VHS. My young children at that time loved it. I was able to finally find it again and purchase it on DVD for my grandchildren. I am anticipating the day I can enjoy watching them laugh at the many funny scenes in this movie.
4,Rocketman,Bought this as a Christmas Present for my daughter and she liked. Service was great as ordered it a few days before Christmas and it arrived in time for Christmas Giving.
4,Great flick,"First of all I own the VHS (no clue why the studio hasn't released this gem to DVD).I really enjoyed this movie, Harland Williams is great. As usual he portrays a spaced out character {see him in Down Persicope, Half Baked, Sorority Boys}...anyway a good movie to sit around with a few friends and have a few laughs. Be sure to watch till the end of the credits there is a little surprise."
5,"Harland Williams, a clean version of Jim Carey","This is a terribly funny movie for both kids and adults. Harland Williams does an outstanding job playing an eccentric and loveable guy with some rather odd sayings and quirks. The film is filled with hilarious scenes; the isolation chamber, the g-force simulation, ""It wasn't me!"", and please don't drink milk when they are at the press conference to announce who will be going to Mars! This is a clever and cute movie and I enjoy watching it over and over."
5,Great Movie,"This was one of the funniest movies I have ever seen!! Harland Williams and the rest of the cast still make me laugh, and I've seen the movie 10 or 15 times by now. I would really like to see it come out on DVD so that I could buy it."
5,Yet Another Underrated Disney Live Action Comedy,"Initially when I saw this film in the theatre I thought it was rather nauseating. However after viewing this on video at home I came to like it. In fact, I thought this was a very funny as well as an extremely amusing film. As an aside, after viewing some recent films such as MISSION TO MARS and RED PLANET I have come to the conclusion that ROCKETMAN did a much better job of depicting the surface of Mars. ROCKETMAN has sort of a retro look and feel about it. Yet when compared to what Disney was producing in the 70s this is a far better film than many of those light comedies. Some of the scenes were dumb, I mean really dumb, but that's what makes it so amusing and funny. I liked it."
5,One of the Funniest Movies You've Never Seen,"This is a tour de force performance from a film comedian that is the funniest person this side of Jim Carrey. Harland Williams, who you may have seen in bit parts as the Serial Killer Hitchhiker in ""There's Something About Mary"" and the State Trooper who takes a swig from Jim Carrey's beer bottle in ""Dumb and Dumber"", plays Fred Randall, an eccentric computer programmer thrust into the role of a mission specialist on a manned Mars flight. What ensues is a laugh riot from pre-flight astronaut training to the return flight home. The isolation room sequence and the official announcement of Randall to the Mars mission will have you in tears. William Sadler, Jessica Lundy, and Beau Bridges costar in a film that is short on dazzling special effects, but very long on side-splitting hilarity. For some odd reason, Disney has refused to release this film on DVD in the U.S."
3,"An incredibly silly show...not really good, but silly!","First of all, it's important to realize that it's possible for a movie to be quite funny without being worthy of 5-stars. That's the case with this show.Why it's good:1) There are plenty of funny bits, including times when I laughed right out loud.2) The use of characters who do not have any humor contrast markedly with the one character that is entirely wacko.3) The bizarre lead character is at the same time full of childlike wonder and technical ability (though he hides his abilities well).Why it's not a 5-star show:1) OK, it's an older movie, but the special effects are still quite hokey and simple.2) The characters are fun, but the acting is only marginally good.3) The storyline is extremely predictable.Does this mean that I didn't enjoy it? No, I enjoyed the movie quite a lot. It is, nevertheless, a fun, fun movie - though a bit crass in parts.3 stars."
5,Rocketman,"This is a movie that will make the whole family laugh. If you haven't seen it, you should."
5,One of our funniest family movies,"This has been a long time favorite of our family; we watch it often, and quote from it regularly. After watching for many times over the years, we laugh even harder in anticipation of many scenes. Thanks to Disney for finally making this available."
5,FUN,"Love the quirky main character that comically goes through life's challanges, with little effort, when things should be straining. Good clean fun."
3,Love the product...not the packaging,"I was so excited to finally find this movie for my brother and I, this was a huge childhood memory for both of us. When I recieved my package the envelope was completely ripped open exposing the product, luckily it did not fall out or get ruined. I was disappointed since usually Amazon is very good about packaging. The movie is such a funny, silly movie and I loved reliving some old memories."
5,Rocketman,This is the funniest video I have ever seen! My husband and our granddaughter have watched it so much that they can quote the lines of the actors while the actors are saying it. It is one movie that you will want to watch over and over!
2,Google has more!,"I have decided, this is the last book on software tools I'll ever buy. It didn't have anything that I didn't find while googling the subject. There are no brilliant insights from the author or cookbook recipes that save you time. At best, it's an abridged collation of internet sources on the subject."
5,"Inspirational, shows the depth to God's love and mercy.","Amy and her family certainly came through much more adversity than your average immigrants would. The mighty mercy and depth of God's love is shown again and again in this poignant story. I found myself emotionally involved with this tender story from the start and felt as if I had known her family personally. This story could put a very different perspective on our daily struggles. Thank you Amy, for your courage and committment. B. Clyse"
3,Goodbye is not for ever,The books arrived in good condition and promptly but surprised to receive three copies and charged for three copies when I only ordered one.
5,LOVE this mouse,"Since its original release, my family and I love this mouse. We've been buying them in these 5-packs because it is cheaper than buying them one at a time.PROS: 5-buttons placed in useful positions. Great for ""page back"" and ""page forward"". Size is good for average adult hands as well as kids. No mouse ball to clean. Very durable. In all these years (5+), we've only had one mouse start to have a left click button be less sensitive, but still works.CONS: compared to some of the newer mice out there today, this one does not have the high resolution of those (mostly the ones made for gaming).Would I buy this again? Heck yeah! This purchase is like our forth 5-pack. We now have one of these on every computer we own (including laptop) as well as on our extended family's computers.If you have more than one computer, BUY THIS.If you only need it on one computer, buy the single packMicrosoft Intellimouse Optical Mouse.You will not regret it (unless you are using it for gaming)."
4,A kids CD for kids of any age,"Bought this CD when our daughter was just a few months old--now she's past 4 years and loves listening to these ladies. Nice variety of fast and slow tunes (Mom's personal favorite is ""The Laundry""), all with friendly lyrics and interesting themes."
5,Moves For the Big Boys & Girls,"If you're planning on purchasing this DVD, be sure that you have perfected the basics of Salsa dancing. Learn to Dance Salsa Intermediate 1 does not, I repeat, does not come with baby steps.The hook step, hook step variations. Hammerlock and reverse hammerlock. Hand-over patterns, leads, and turns. It's all included on this 4th DVD in the Learn to Dance Salsa series. And guess what guys and gals. You'll be doing them all without assistive devices. No close-up shots to give you an ant's eye view of move. No 64-counts worth of repetition of moves. No humdrum pace to allow you to have time to work through moves slowly.This DVD is undoubtedly for more experienced dancers. Particularly those who know how to Salsa but are looking to polish the moves they know and learn how to better incorporate different patterns into their routines. Dancers not quite at this skill level may want to consider a previous DVD in the SalsaCrazy series."
3,salsa moves are great BUT....,"don't get me wrong, the salsa moves here are great but the teacher concentrates more on teaching the man's steps and forgets about the lady's steps. so all of you ladies out there, sorry for you."
5,Great for dancing & coupling,"Since the beginning of the year, my partner and I have been ""taking Salsa classes"" nightly via the SalsaCrazy Learn to Dance Salsa DVD series. It has been a wonderful experience. We have danced together before doing ballroom style dancing and thought that picking up Salsa dancing would be fun as well. We were right. The DVDs took us from the basics that focused primarily on technique-the focus of the first three DVDs in the series-to this one that has allowed us to focus more on style. From the first DVD which we breezed through learning Salsa basics to this one which took us a bit longer to conquer, we've seen great improvement. It has helped us discover a new passion, for dancing and our relationship."
4,Wolf's Rain - Perfect Collection,"I bought these CDs for my daughter, she is 9, and she really enjoyed the series. The art work is great and the flow of the episodes themselves is good. I feel that the story can be a little corny and over dramatic at times. However, I have watched other Anime movies and shows and that is normal. I bought it for my daughter so was a little hesitant because I know that Anime can be very violent at times but the violence in this series is not that bad. As mentioned earlier the art work is very good and the story is easy to follow and holds your interest. Overall I would rate the item w/ 4 out of 5 stars."
1,Never delivered,"Bought this item as a gift a month ago, and I'm still waiting for this gift to be shipped. In fact, I am still waiting for the payment to even be charged. Wolf's Rain Perfect Collection was suppose to be a Christmas gift, so a little heads-up on what is going on would have been much appreciated. Not going to cancel my order yet, but I am close."
2,Wolf's Rain: Anime Legends-Perfect Collection,My granddaughter's just couldn't wait to watch this DVD. They were disappointed becausea couple of the DVD's would freeze up while watching. Too bad....hardly ever happens that I geta DVD that skips or freezes.
5,Powerful!!,I went to see this movie and there were only 5 people in the audience. I think one person fell asleep but the rest of us were lifted by the movie. I think we should all take the time out to see this one. Not just because of 9/11 but for tolerance.
5,One of the best spiritual and familia films ever! Powerfull Insightful!,"A powerful, insightful journey film focusing on spiritual and family values. Roger Guenveur Smith, as always, is excellent as the father of a Muslim family who seeks to guide his son in his strict spiritual footsteps. Nia Long is superb as the young man's mother. And Evan Ross is outstanding as the conflicted Muslim son. The film shows the racism, rejection and ridicule Muslims face in this country, especially after 911. MOOZ-LUM is one of the best movies I have ever seen."
5,Amazing film!!!,"This film, which appears to be produced on a low budget, is just a master piece for debut director Qasim Basir. I was completely amazed at his directorial debut. Frankly, I did not expect the performance to be so riveting. Evan Ross, who played the character of Tariq Mahdi, was simply put believable. At times I wondered if he was in fact--as in real life--a Muslim. So I looked him up on Google. Yes, I know--outlandish--but that's the kind of acting skills the young man exudes on screen. So all in all, it was an amazing film, which in my opinion deserves more media attention. So Bravo to the amazing cast and crew!!"
2,Well done at multiple levels,"The plots and subplots covered in this film touched on many delicate issues still prevalent amongst ethnically different groups of people. This was the first time I really ""heard"" the African-American Muslim perspective and the impact of 9/11. It was a painful but very realistic review of a period in my life that I will never forget! I loved seeing Long and Ross in roles that were a great constrast to previously played roles. Well done and G_d bless all who helped with the production and delivery of this work.M"
1,Save your money,Typical liberal propaganda. Just turn on the news to see muslims as the victims. Looks like only liberals and muslims went to see this flick by the Box Office stats.
5,I cried watching this beautiful movie!!,This was well put together and very true in facts about the Muslim culture and how society viewed muslims at the time. I believe everyone should buy this movie!! Muslim or not!
4,A great movie.,Evan Ross is such an excellent actor. He brought it as an young man struggling with his father's extreme Muslim teaching.
5,Trio Test,"If you are gay and you don't love Schwarzkopf' s recording of the Trio from Der Rosenkavalier you need to be sent to a re-education camp. Because even all the classy straight people love it too. Heaven, ja, ja.."
5,A new beginning,"Mother Love is a touching tale of a widowed nurse, who joins the Peace Corps, and starts a new adventure, a new life. This novel is wonderfully written. It is inspiring that Barbara can continue making choices and move forward with her life. The descriptions Ann McCauley uses, for both the emotional adventure and the Honduran mountainous country side, give you the feeling that you are with Barbara at every turn."
2,Horse Whinnycoo Clock,"I got this clock as a gift for a 1 y.o. child and I was very pleased with it.The clock was a hit with the child - luckily there is a button that allows for the horse to come out even when it is not the right time. The clock looks very cute, and the horse makes a good galloping sound before coming out and going neighhhhh, so that you know its coming and the child have the time to look for it. It is also good that there is a little light sensor that automatically turns it off at night.edit:Unfortunately, the clock stopped working after about 6 months - the horse would come out and not retract, or would not come out at all. Eventually, the horse just stopped coming out at all. My child never abused (or even touched for that matter) since it was always out of reach.Oh well - nice idea and cute clock. But for the price I would have expected something more durable."
3,This horse does not run,"Love the horse CooClock, but the horse stopped coming out at the hour after about 6 months. The button still makes him work.I am ordering another."
2,Not what I expected,"After reading this book, I was disappointed in the respect that half of the content was a shop tool handbook more so than a boat joinery manual. Yes, the ideas and suggestions were valuble, but you should already know this going into boat construction.A few of his suggestions pertaining to using an inverted circular saw as a ""make-do"" table saw is down-right dangerous at best. (page 38)His chapter on ""Woodworking Projects for the Home"" was a nice addition, but I'm trying to figure out what it's doing in a boat joinery book?In the end, I'm glad I purchased the book as I gleaned a few ideas from it."
4,Very Basic,This book touches on basic woodworking joinery. Its a good reference for novices. The only short commings that i could find were that it wasnt as advanced as i thought it would be.
4,Good but a little shy on depth,"I thought the book had a lot of good information, and enjoyed reading the book, but felt that it didn't offer as much ""depth"" as I wanted. I think more detail about working in a non-level, non-square environment would have made it more useful. As it is, I think it is a good book but nothing distinguishes it from any number of others covering the topic."
2,Not much in this book for someone looking to change the interior of their sailboat,"I thought this book would be full of ideas and pictures demonstrating interior changes to a boat. The author talks about his boat a lot, but has very few pictures or drawings that show the work that he has done. I expected to see multiple designs of new galleys, new heads, etc. Instead, you only get a few drawings and few new ideas. I would not recommend this book."
3,Awesome Review,"A little stand alone spin off from the Gundam universe. Doesn't really start anywhere, or go anywhere...not bad if you like Gundams it just doesn't play any role in anyway. Steals a little story here and there from the other series."
2,I'm an avid anime and Gundam fan and this movie is terrible!,"I'll keep it simple as I'm watching the movie while I type.... I am a huge fan of the Gundam series, I thought this would be a rare treasure but it isn't. I opened the case and the disc was marked as disc one but where in the hell is disc two? I then put it into my blu-ray player and began the movie, and right off from the start the plot just moves way too quickly to stay interested as you usually do in most of the Gundam series. I just didn't get the same feeling as I did with every other Gundam DVD I have seen. I would describe it as more of a feeling of disgust. This puts the franchise to shame. I do not recommend this to any Gundam fan."
5,"Our culture, what's left of it","I love this author, he is so brutally honest. I am studying human services and so I relate to this book and what the author describes.I get the giggles and nod my head alot when reading this book!!"
5,"""personal experience with little data""","It's true, and Primo Levi & Dalrymple share the same shortcoming..."
2,Obviously not everyone is going to like your book,"It's rare you see such gushing praise for an essay collection, more impressive is the average length of these Amazon reviews. It seems the reviewers like to look at their own words as much as this author does.I didn't like this book for a simple reason. There are better things to read than varied complaints and woes about changing times. Sure, sometimes it is good but these lopsided views.... he is as focused on discontent as he is verbose.If that sounds good to you, buy this book..... most people have stuff to do."
4,"Overall, good studio CD","I got this album for my dad, for christmas... I've seen these guys at fests and he likes bluegrass. we were both feeling it at christmas."
1,RUDE & AGGRESSIVE,"The number of times ""Shut Up"" appears in these stories is shocking!! We have never seen the series but we have a cute Scholastic Thomas book and when our son received a Thomas Train Set I picked up a couple more books from the library. My husband and I were VERY disapointed with the language and the aggressive nature of all the characters (trains & people). Trains hitting each other and saying ""there's more coming should you misbehave."" Threatening to send trains away for being ""clumsy."" Of course our son loves the books because he loves trains but we don't want him learning anything these books have to teach."
5,Breaking bad ass,"I thought season one was pretty good, but the second one kept me watching. So hangips on picture quality and there was no lag in the streaming times."
5,fantastic,How did I just now find out about this show. Each episode and each season just gets better and better. Wait till you see the end of season 4!
5,Love this show!,"I really enjoy this show - the interaction of the characters is terrific and the storyline is always twisting and interesting. My biggest complaint by far is the network woebsite as it is really difficult to find out when the next season will begin or how to find the current season's episodes. Amazon makes it quite easy to find and watch, and for that I am grateful."
5,Everyone was right.,This series is awesome and every episode I watch draws me in deeper and deeper. The show is as addictive as the drug its about. I just started watching it from the very beginning 2 weeks ago and I'm pretty sure I'll be buying all the seasons. At 1.99 an episode it's pretty cheap entertainment for me. I highly recommend it.
5,Breaking Bad: The Complete Second Season,Once I watched the first season I had to order the second season. It couldn't get to my door fast enough. I spellbinding series.
4,DustMan Breaking Bad opion,Having been in a few self inflected predeciments with drugs in my youth I truly can relate to this show it rocks. It truly keeps you captivated and intrigued.you look forward and cant wait for week to end and sunday night to roll around to see the next episode. The dark comedy and drama is like no other. Bryan Cranston is brilliant and Aaron Paul Is a great actor allso he realy plays the part quite well you actually route for him time to time. Any way I will be buying the first and second season just to show people who have not seen it.
5,Breaking Bad Season 1 and 2,"It is a very witty and well ""acted"" show!!! I have not finished the previous Seasons, but am looking forward to the new season!"
4,Came as described,"Great, I like this series and can't wait to watch the rest of it! The dvd's came quickly and no damage."
5,Breaking Bad,I love this show with its great acting and intriguing plots. Plot continues to grow with more twists and character developments.
5,A must watch!,"Absolutely the BEST series I have ever watched My son turned me on to this series, thank goodness! LOVE IT"
5,I dare you.,"At the end of episodes 12 and 13, you will sit in your chair, mouth open, stunned in silence.You have never seen a dramatic series like it. The best acting, writing and directing, and oh yes, CINEMATOGRAPHY, evercreated.Vince G. , you are GENIUS.Don't miss this series."
1,Didn't play has been sent back,"The DVD wouldn't play even after updating my player only one of the four DVD,s would play. The DVD has been returned."
1,Huh?,And it's just okay by the thinnest of hairs. Don't bother watching this series unless you already have no life and no promise of ever having a life. And they actually paid someone to star and act in this drivel? I'm just saying..
4,video messed up,"The dvd was new in sealed package but i had a horrible time getting it to play. It skipped, stopped. And i just kept trying different.players till. I finally.was.able to watch.it. BIT. BY BIT"
5,Breaking Bad,"For anyone watching this series, you will understand the 5 stars! Being able to download episodes from Amazon makes it possible to watch those that were missed. It's very easy."
5,Best Show On Television!,"This show is absolutely flawless! From season 1 all the way through season 4, Breaking Bad finds a way to leave you hooked and on the edge of your seat. It doesn't get much better than this!!"
5,great quaility great show!,The only negative I have is that I wish I just got the show on instant video. It took me until season 5 to realize that I could watch them instantly through amamzon. Now that is awesome!
5,Simply Fantastic,"The best TV series ever! I can't wait for season 5. I'm the last person to own movies or tv shows on dvd, but I had to order this series and watch it all over again. It is that damn good!"
4,Good TV series to get hooked on.,"Even thought the first season was a bit slow, but TV series has proven to be one of the best. Has many twists & turns to keep viewers interested."
5,Season 2 Breaking Bad,Love second 2 of Breaking Bad. I never watched it when it was on cable. I love the series and will be getting all five dvds.
5,A Love Story,This is a very beautiful book. A translator takes an evening class in art history forsix years in a row. She and the professor fall in love. The book is very beautifullywritten and very realistic.
1,Would not hold fabric,Tried to glue a tote bag and it would not stick anything together - returned product.
1,Did not perform as advertised,"I tried to use this fabric glue to glue fabric together, but it did not hold at all. I was very disapointed."
1,does not work,"If you are looking for a glue that holds fabric together, this isn't it. They need to rename this product as its misleading."
5,AD-TECH FINE LINE GLUE,I DID NOT THINK THAT THE GLUE WOULD COME OUT IN A FINE LINE BUT IT REALLY DOES. I DOES EVERY THING THEY SAY IT WILL. A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY. AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED IT IS THE BEST GLUE ON THE MARKET.
3,Too many Special Effects,I loved the music on this DVD and the video topics were good. I thought there were to many special effects -- double exposures and long fades in and out. I wish I could buy the music separately.
1,A Trivial Performance,"I found the tempo much too fast.Drama is lost when conversations in recitatives are executed at breakneck speed. At that speed, who has time for proper vocal inflections?Certain sublime moments of the opera are glossed over so as to become almost irrelevant.And personally, I found Hendrick's Susanna so much more ... feminine."
3,singers are good but tempo is too sluggish,"The best thing about this work is the price. It's cheaper than most of the Figaro, which have decent quality.also, singers are quite good. But Guilini's tempo is too dull to be Mozart. In my humble opinion (I have most of the Firago currently available in the store), the best Figaro is done by Karajan (London). For those who hate him because of his popularity, I would choose Bohm as the second choice."
5,Very high quality music,"I love Mozart --""Le Nozzi di Figaro"" is my favorite Mozart opera. This CD is very good, have really enjoyed it since it came. And the price was right!"
3,This is not a must-have Figaro,"Cossoto and Schwartzkopf are both great but other castings are normal. Moffo is too shallow and light, Taddei is not at his best, Waechter is not characteristic. The orchestration is too flighty.This might be the fourth or fifth choice; the first, Kleiber, the second, Bohm, the third, Gui, the fourth, Colin Davis...But this one is better than those of Karajan, Muti and Solti."
2,Waste of time and money,"Pretty useless. Should more properly be titled ""Great Family Resorts"", as that is what it principly addresses. Has some information about seperate activities (at the resorts) for children, but very little pertaining to ""family"" vacations. Found information about locations with which I am familiar to be misleading or just plain wrong (ex., Calling Hilton Head Island ""unspoiled"" is about like saying that Manhattan is in its natural state as acquired from the Indians)."
4,Great find,It was a little expensive but my daughter loves science. She is going to absolutely love doing all the experiments.
5,Instant Classic,"I bought this on a hunch after reading a newspaper article about some amateur musician/artist with mental problems. This is absolutely NOT the type of music I normally listen to... yet I was completely slack-jawed and awe-struck when I first listened to this CD. In other words: I love this stuff. I didn't even have to listen to it a few times. I liked it right away. I am not saying that this is for everyone, but this material is an instant classic. You kind of have to understand this guy to appreciate the music, and if you don't then you don't... I am sure it is ok by him... he'd still ask you: ""hi how are you""?"
2,Disappointing,"I like Sparkelhorse, which is the reason I purchased it. But I don't like much of this at all. My favorite singers are considered ""bad"" by many (Neil Young, Tom Waits, Wayne Coyne, J. Mascis) but Daniel Johnston's voice grates me like few voices I've ever heard. I accept that some may like it because I am very used to people telling me singing I like are bad. So, rather than go on, I'll just conclude by saying I have already retired this CD to the ""will never listen to again"" section of my collection."
5,Enraptured and inspired recordings!,"This set of Beethoven' s piano trios has overly been one of the most famed in the late sixties. The inspired and magnificent musical chemistry among these three soloists was of first-rate class. On one hand you should be aware the fabulous rapport between Mrs. Dupre and his husband Mr. Barenboim in the set of cello sonatas; on the other hand Pinchas Zukerman and Barenboim recorded too some Beethoven 's violin sonatas; so it's not easy to understand the positive vibes.It should be underlined we are talking interpretative freshness, and that youthful breadth among this ensemble that hardly, adding all his ages, would be under the 100 years. If you are seeking for definitive versions, go for the set of Kempff, Szerying and Fournier, but this is a very wise option."
5,Inspirational,Well researched and well written. The characters are compelling. I am looking forward to the next novel by Ms. Doherty.
5,outstanding,This is wonderful book. I feel like I'm right there urging Cristeen and Matt on. Tammy's descriptions are great. I feel like I'm there. I want Tammy to come out with more books. I'm buying more to give as Christmas presents. Tammy keep up the good work
1,Get a life,"If you seriously ""dig"" Puddle Of Mudd, you need a kick in the face. Don't waste your money on Puddle Of Mudd. If you like ""nu-metal"" sort of music, get the new CD by Cold or the Deftones. If you want an excellent new album, get Hail To The Theif by Radiohead."
2,Not up to par,"I was disappointed in this cd. I own come clean and it is one of my favorites, I don't care for this at all."
1,This record is strait up bad,"I'm not to big on posting bad reviews, but this album just stinks. Any hapless retard could wright there crappy guitar cords and song after song after song about bad girlfrends.But anyways don't make the same mistake I did buy buying this just cus there last album was decent. sorry to any fans I may have offended but I think thay could of come up with a better follow up to come clean than this."
4,Great CD Buy it today!,I couldn't wait for this cd to come out and am not disappointed at all. The songs really grab at your emotions. The lyrics are great and stick in your head for days. You will listen to this one over and over again!
5,great cd,i think this could be puddle of mudds best work yet!! this is a great cd i highly reccommend!!!
1,Stay FAR away...,"Puddle of Mudd is not a good band. They do not make good music. They should not be considered musicians. And certainly no one should be subject to the type of pain this album causes to your ears. The fact is, Puddle of Mudd sounds exactly like all the other ""grunge/{nu}metal-revival"" bands today (ya know Trapt, Smile Empty Soul, Nickelback etc.) Wes writes horrible lyrics. ""I'm drowning in a pool of misery""-- come on my dog can harf up better lyrics than that. The fact that these guys can't play a riff worth a damn doesn't help either. I was so disgusted with Life on Display that I threw it out after listening to it a few times. Honestly- there was one ""good"" song (track 6). If you absolutely must buy a Mudd album, purchase Come Clean. Even though Come Clean is pretty bad, Life on Display is 25 times worse."
2,what can i say?,"soooo i heard ""away from me"" on the radio. I thought the song kicked ass. The beat was good, the lyrics were awesome. So my friend bought the cd for my birthday. I was like cool. Well i am glad i didnt waste 13 dollars on it!! atleast she bought it. I dont recommend this to anyone. There last album was actually good, but this one.....no...go buy somthing else. It's not that bad, but i think it is boring. Alot of the songs sound the same. It just lacks creativity and beat. If anything, buy there last album instead."
1,This is pure crap,"WARNING. CONSTANT LISTENING TO THIS CD WILL MUTILATE YOUR EARDRUMS. THAT'S HOW BAD THIS CD IS.Ok, ""Come Clean"", PoM first release, was ok. It had some catchy songs like ""Blurry"" and ""She Hates Me"". But this Cd has no songs like that. The vocalist sucks. He wants to be Kurt Cobain, and imitates him rather poorly. All the lyrics are the same heart broken mess that's hard to listen to for a long period of time because of its repitition. speaking of repitition, every song sounds the same! the single ""Away from Me"" is the worst song on the cd. horrible vocals, pointless lyrics, and music that barely passes as music. this cd is horrible. stay AWAY. if you want good rock/grunge, go for nirvana. don't listen to this."
1,*sigh*,"Another band that seems like they were rushed to release a cd due to contract issues or something. Because this album is nothing like the Puddle of Mudd I like. I DO like the album 'Come Clean', but this cd Life on Display has done nothing but just given me headache after headache. I do like Away From Me from the cd...but that seems like the only one I do like. Way to fail PoM. I'll be looking for your third cd which will hopefully have more thought in it than this one did."
2,Of Course,"I had high hopes, but they were dashed on the jagged rocks below. I thought this cd would sound more like their previous effort, Come Clean, but lo and behold it doesn't The songs all sound exactly alike, the cd is much softer, and nothing sticks with you at all. The tracks are impossible to differentiate between. However, there are three good songs: Cloud 9, Away from Me, and Spin you Around. Listening to those will give you a good feel for what the rest of the album is like. But this really isn't worth getting. Do yourself a favor and pick up these 4 cds to satisfy all of your mainstream hardrock needs:1.) Sevendust- Seasons2.) Mushroomhead- Xiii3.) Hoobastank- The Reason4.) Alien Antfarm- truANTThese are the only hard rock cds released in 2003 worth getting."
4,SCREW ALL U GUYS!!!,"This band knows more about good music than 80% of the new bands out there today. They have a great sound, and don't sound like their balls got cut off. So screw all u guys giving them bad reviews, u all obviously want ur balls cut off and like bands that sound like girls with guitars. Puddle of Mudd i got ur back."
1,Another puddle of s***,"Here we go again. Another rip-off of a rip-off has found it's way into the music stores. This is all trash, with no musical elements to be found. No one can sing or play music of any kind in this band. Is the enhanced version supposed to be alot better? I highly doubt it would make a difference. Please avoid at all costs."
3,Here's Mudd in your EyE,"Exactly, this is keg party music. Away from Me is the shiner. The black eye of the CD; the only good hit if you will. There are parts that are ok, but this isn't a band you'd want to list among your favourites, if you had any dignity that is. ;) ""Change My Mind"" is very Blind Melonish. And, no, they aren't Nirvana-like at all. The rhyming part in ""Away from Me"" is really amateur and annoying, and it shouldn't be. The line ""maybe we could taste the rain"" for example, hmm, maybe Kurt Cobain could sing that and it would mean something, but it doesn't here. THAT is the cincher."
1,Ripoffs,"These guys not only copy Nirvana, they got signed onto Fred Durst's ****ty record label, Flawless Records. I'm not a huge Nirvana fan. In fact, I'm not a fan of Nirvana at all. In my opinion, Pearl Jam was the best grunge band, followed by Soundgarden. Buy anything from those bands, instead of this bad excuse for a poser grunge album."
3,I'm still a PoM fan!,"Life on Display is a surprisingly decent CD, given that it's not as hard as the first. My fave song is Away From Me, since it brings up memories of Nirvana. Could have been better, but I'll enjoy it for as long as possible."
1,Recycled teen spirit,"The only thing that's less original than Puddles' debut, ""Come Clean"", is making a ""Come Clean: Part 2"". The only thing that's different here is there are occasional wah-wah or acoustic guitars. Puddles have so little originality, they make some band like 'N Sync look like innovators."
5,great CD,Anyone who likes POM will like this cd. Its different from their first one and has lots of variety. Great cd to listen to over and over.
5,POM Rocks!,This cd has a mix of emotions.Everything you've ever needed in a cd.POM covers all the emotions all us rockers feel.It can make you feel sympathetic one minute and feel the hate the next.Life on display is worth buying.You won't be able to take it out of your cd player.
2,Life On Display is only OK,"After enjoying the first Puddle of Mudd CD release extremely, I expected much more of their second CD, it was OK, but the music was uninteresting and lacked the passion and cohesion that the band had on the first album."
1,Puddle of Mudd have to be the worst band ever.,Seriously. I can't believe that it hasn't become illegal to write this kind of music. I think that Dave Grohl needs to sue this band immediately for ripping off Nirvana so much. It's frankly unreal and ridiculous that a band could get away with this. Puddle of Mudd have to be kidding us in some way or another. Whatever.
1,Puddle of CRUD!,"Why can't they just stop making records? It is obvious that Wes is desperately trying (and failing miserably) to sound like Kurt Cobain. This band is a complete fraud, youngsters (as it seems to appeal to them) should take back thier CDs and demand a refund. Nobody should have to spend money to listen to such crap. Fake angst by a fake band. No integrity. It is obvious they are in it for the money. Puddle Of Mudd = a big pile of sh*t"
2,Disappointing,"I bought this cd off of amazon after reading many rave reviews of it but this is not a good cd for Puddle of Mudd. I am disappointed with it. Dont buy this cd, save your money!!"
2,A Huge Step Down,"If it wasn't for such an awsome first alblum, ""Life on Display"" might have been a good album. Unfortunatly, ""Come Clean"" was one of the greatest albums of all time in my opinion and Puddle of Mudd just didn't step up and fill their own shoes this time. There are a couple of good songs, but when compared to past songs like ""Blurry"", ""Conrol"", and ""Drift and Die"", this alblum sucks. As a stand alone album, this is not that bad, but as a sophmore album from what I thought was an awsome band, it is sorely lacking. Don't buy this album if you are already a Puddle of Mudd fan. If this is your first time listening to Puddle of Mudd, trust me and go back and buy ""Come Clean"" instead."
3,I don't understand,I feel like there is a lot of dislike for this band ONLY because of Fred Durst/their label and because the lead singer voice slightly sounds like Kurt. I think people shouldn't jump on the bandwagon and take the music for what it is.
2,umm....,"i am a fan of puddle of mudd, but this is horrible. the best song is the 1st single ""away from me"". no songs on this album compare to the old ""She Hates Me"" or ""Blurry"". its not worth the money. but the production is good and the audio sounds clear."
4,Puddle Of Mudd...shining through,"This album is not a bad listen. 'Life On Display' reminds me of Staind's album '14 Shades Of Gray'. But then where Fred Durst is concerned, what would one expect? This album is great for it opens its 13 track listing with a gem of a song called 'Away From Me', that easily became a hit. Three other songs for me set this album apart from the nu-rock scene and the offering of albums daily and they were 'Change My Mind', 'Spin You Around' and 'Freak Of The World'.I cannot for the life of me figure out why this particular album recieved so many bad reviews. Puddle Of Mudd is a highly inventive band that does not sound the same or mundane. And each song has its own particular sound and theme. The lyrics to 12 of the 13 songs, anyone listening can at least find some common ground with the lead singer.Give Puddle Of Mudd a try....you won't be disappointed."
4,Great Album!!!,"This is a great album to own if you enjoy mainstream rock!! You will be listening to every single song over and over until you're spinning around, and going heel over head, lol!!I can't stand all the Nirvana fans who blast this band. It saddens me that you cannot get over the loss of your favorite artists (which was like what.. 10-15 years ago) and begin to re-recognize great new music when you hear it. Just because it may sound similar to another band, doesn't mean you should hate it. I don't hate Pepsi for tasting similar to Coke."
1,terrible,"this record is terrible. nothing like come clean. away from me is ok, but the rest is laughable."
1,Better the first time I heard it...,"This album was definetly better the first time I heard it back in the 90's, by a band called Alice in Chains. I cannot believe that a group of supposedly talented musicians could come up with a CD full of such garbage. On this album absolutely 0% originality is achieved. Basically it sounds like a mix tape of really good 90s rock music. Of course, to the ear it sounds ok, but when you realize that every sound and every sentence of lyrics you hear are things you've heard before, put into a blender- it's pretty bad. This CD is for sure going to start the bands downfall (if they were ever actually high enough to fall). They should be embarrased with this release. Don't waste your money on this. If you must hear it download it. Support good music, not this crap."
5,Great Emotional Rock,Come Clean as we know it was a in your face take at numetal album. The album was blunt but very understandable and it was realistic. Life on Display is absolutely amazing it is very emotional yet it is still metal rock.
3,Is it really puddle of mudd?,"Don't expect this to sound like ""come clean"" as those songs were written by an ex band member who is sitting back making a nice living off the royalties. This album is a true representation of the current members, give it a go and see what you think, I liked it."
3,Just another mediocre sophomore release,"As soon as I heard the first single from Puddle of Mudd's new one on the radio, I was excited b/c it really hit me hard. It reminded me of Kurt Cobain's vocals screaming. After listening to the rest of the album, I am not near as satisfied. They've got a knack for creating a couple great singles on each album, but it seems like they have a problem of ripping most of it from other bands. Ex. Away From Me = Nirvana-""Milk It""2. She Hates Me = Grease-""Summer Nights"" and even mimic themselves at times 3.Drift and Die = ""Time Flies""They've got some talent and I still like some of their songs, but this new album comes off as average. I do admit they are a cool live band and I hope that they continue to improve far beyond this sophomoric try. Try Audioslave's latest instead for a more elaborate and complete new album."
5,an amazing cd,i have to say this cd is amazing! i thought it would be stupid truthfully but the more i hear it the more i like it! its really good you should buy it!
5,How are they going to beat this one?,"Life on Display is wonderful, although I was very fond of come clean, I must admit that this one has the first beat. I think that they put a lot of emotion in this cd and I have no clue on how their next cd is going to beat this one!"
1,gag,"These guys are not artists. They are unimaginative lamebrains unwittingly and badly rewriting already overplayed music from a long dead scene. It's like a few monkeys build a house, and all the other monkeys rave about it, but in reality the house is just a banana tree with a welcome mat... whatever that means.I am constantly astounded as to how waste like this gets on the radio. Buy this cd if you want to vomit everywhere."
1,Puddle of PEE!,"Seriously this is watered-down rock music for people who like their rock watered! It always thrills me when I see bands like this fall out of favor, but I have learned that it usually has nothing to do with the music itself. Their ""PIMPS"" (record execs.) find a band with a better looking lead singer and groups like this get thrown into the dumpster. So what happens? the music doesn't get any better, just the way the band looks does. Isn't that what boy bands do? Well if I must say anything else about this album it would be boring, bland and what ever else I can think of to describe music to sleep to. I am getting tired writing about bands like this but I will continue as long as it changes just one persons mind. If on the other hand this upsets you in anyway I suggest that you checkout some of my other reviews I am sure that will get your panties all twisted up!"
1,unoriginal piece of work,they are so unoriginal and the singer tries so damn hard to sound like kurt cobain it makes me sick.
1,puddle of mud sucks,"puddle of mud is one of the worst bands that is out there right now. words cant even describe how horrible they are. do not buy the album, its worse then there first cd."
3,Not as strong as their debut.,"I think the only thing this album might do better is that it has better lyrics in spots. But on Last.fm I only have 5 out of the 12 tracks as ""loved"". The rest were OK or not that good. Still some of the same heavy riffs in many of the songs as well as some softer songs. Some notables are ""Change My Mind"" and the closer ""Time Flies"" which is part acoustic 'til the chorus.All in all, not a total waste if you're a fan. But in between albums they lost some fire.3 stars."
1,"| 1 | Pure, 100% lowest common denominator bull-$@%!","I'm going to get straight to the point. Puddle of Mudd sucks. They suck very badly. And ironically, their band name describes them perfectly: a Puddle of f*cking MUDD! Although SH*T would probably be a better word.Do I have to review this cd? Do I really have to? Okay I will: it sucks ***, this band sucks ***, and they should be shot for sucking so much ***, especially the singer who's trying to be Kurt Cobain. Puddle of Mudd can lick my a**-crack. How did these jokes make it to television anyway? They are the epitomy of crap; make that bull-crap. Thumbs way f*cking down."
1,not THEM again.....,"YES my friends, the band we all know and NOT LOVE that did that annoying ""Can you take it all awaaaaaaaaaaaaay"" song and that annoying ""I love the way you smack my aaaaaaasssssssssss"" song is back to annoy us all once again...This is just a perfect example of everything wrong with modern rock- annoying and repetitive songs, lead singer trying to look exactly like Kurt Cobain or Eddie Vedder, little teenyboppers hearing them on top 40 stations and then calling themselves ""rock fans"" when they've never even heard of Alice in Chains,, and so on... well the band WAS discovered by FRED DURST, so what do u expect??Please don't support this band.. go buy some Candlebox or Soundgarden to hear this type of sound done right!"
5,Degenerate Art,"This single handedly got me interested in the art of glassblowing. I'd highly recommend it to anyone that smokes or enjoys glassblowing. The documentary really displays the art of glassblowing as an underground movement, which I ceased to even realize. Since watching it, I've taken up glassblowing classes and made a few pipes of my own!"
4,Fit my Brinkman Grill,I have a Brinkman Pro Series2500 and these were perfect replacements. The quality seems good. I used the grill a few times since and no problems!
4,A highly enjoyable book,"JCO takes us deep into the mind of a child killer -- that is a killer who just happens to be a chid. It's a disturbing affair, with the style random and jumbled to give a bit of consistency to this troubled mind.As an early adult recovering from a near similiar fate as the central character, Richard Elwood, I find it an accurate portrait of the descent into childhood madnesses. It is also a realistic picture of middle America in the 1960s.JCO writing is superb and she really pulls you into the minds of her characters through Elwood's slow narrative.A great book"
1,Frankenbase,"I purchased this base for a Savage 110FP 308. The Front base is solid however the rear base windage screws knock loose every 4 shots. Just a very bad design; and a 308 does not have that much recoil. Stick with a cheap weaver mount, it's much more solid. Shame"
1,Disappointed....,Since the first song they have this weird artificial bird chirping or nut cracking sound going on throughout the songs...I got annoyed ever since hearing it for the first time! I could not stand it and skipped to the next one....then there goes the nut cracking or whatever that is....randomly.Later I noticed myself not concentrating on the music and the rhythms but how many times those annoying repeating chirps are in one song...I regret buying it honestly :( but good thing I bought two more of the traditional classic songs to replace it.
5,Love Mozart!,"I may be biased because Mozart is my favorite composer of all time. But anyway, I think my 6 month old love this CD also. I put it when we play -he loves those chirping little birds in Leopold's Toy Symphony-. I put it when I'm about to put him to sleep. I put it when he is sleeping. It is very relaxing. I truly recommend it."
4,Important album,"While as usual not everything is first rate, and also some of this album has aged quite a bit, it is one of the better and more essential YMO albums. They were quite innoveative at the time and should not be forgotten for what they were: one of the most innovative early synth groups that were working in the tradition of Kraftwerk."
4,good movie,I always loved this movie. So much so that I turn it off once things take a turn for the worse because I was able to relate to and feel for the actors because of their great portrayl of the characters that they used to play. Watch this movie
4,Classic!,Another goodie for the collection. This is one that I like to watch again & again. I'm happy that I will finally own it.
3,Flawed But Admirable Effort From The Hughes Brothers!,"This film has all the elements to become a fascinating melodrama with interesting characters. But instead shifts wildly into different directions; black ghetto melodrama, Vietnam experiences and heist flick, in that order. The characters are also one-dimensional and unlikable. Main faults are jarring shifts in tone and severe miscasting in vital roles, primarily the 'Vietnam cast' and Chris Tucker is wrong for the role, he can't play serious and his comic touch sometimes lowers the dramatic impact. On the other hand, Larenz Tate delivers a credible performance and the best in the whole movie. Entertaining, controversial and ultimately makes its' point, but could of been much better. Extras: Spot Martin Sheen in a cameo. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 6!"
