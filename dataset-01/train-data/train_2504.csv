5,great story with delightful characters,"I read this book on vaction and loved it. We learn more about Josie's past (fascinating) and see her in a more fleshed out role as mother. As usual, the other characters in the book were lively, colorful and fun to be with. The victim is someone we all love to hate, which makes the book all that much more enjoyable. The story involves media coverage of a remodel a la ""this old house."" The woman who is the star of the program (the victim) is someone who has known Josie in the past. When she turns up dead, there are no shortage of suspects, but the biggest mystery is her relationship with Josie. A great ""curl up and forget the world for awhile"" book."
5,Lynn Medow is Awesome!!!,"""Lynn Medow is a highly-experienced, easy-to-understand and compassionate teacher whose flow is very natural and relaxing. ""Graceful Aging"" is an excellent value with well over two hours of yoga instruction separated into three logical and progressive practices - from a chair practice, through a gentle practice and finally to a slightly more advanced deeper practice. I would strongly recommend this video to anyone looking to add a yoga routine to their senior center activities list, community recreational yoga programs or just for your own individual use to complement an existing personal regimen. Namaste!"""
5,Great DVD!,This DVD is really great for people of all abilities. I personally liked the segment that is for people with limited ability to get onto the floor.
5,Awesomest!,"Having just recently witnessed James in full flight live, I can certainly bear witness to the awesome power of this guy. And he does love to scream, so this cd is no surprise. Any of his cds are a worthy addition to a music lover's collection."
1,Fabulous!!!,"Heard his music in a clip on Ebay about the relationship between a dog and porpoise.It made the clip so outstanding and meaningful. It took me a while to find him, but I'mso happy I did. His song ""Hear the Wind"" and ""Forever and Ever"" are simply the best!"
3,"As described, lacks comfort","The chair is as described but not comfortable. Reviews have said that it lacks durability, however, I feel it will last a few years if you are carful with it."
2,poorly made!,"This chair, although comfortable is very poorly made. After only a couple of times being used by my 150 lb wife, the seams started tearing. Save your money. Don't buy this one!"
4,Very good lounger,"I was looking for a chair that was comfortable when laying poolside to tan my back. This lounger is great and very comfortable to use. It could stand to be a little wider, but definately comfortable. The face-hole is perfect while laying on your stomach."
4,nice but bulky,"In terms of comfort, you cannot beat this beach chair. I hope you have a big trunk though, because it does not fold up to a easily stored size. The head rest sticks out and its thick when its folded up."
1,would like to return,"The ergo lounger would be a great product for someone who is tall. For someone my height of 5'3"" it is very uncomfortable to lay on your stomach. I can not use it.I would like to return it to Amazon if you would provide me with shipping instructions"
1,Disappointing,"I was so excited to find this chair online. I was excited that it was aluminum (so it wouldn't rust), it looked comfortable with all the pillows, and that it had the face hole which would make it easy to read while laying on my stomach. Unfortunately when the chair came it did not live up to what I was expecting. First of all, instead of comfortable it was rather stiff and secondly, it already had a tear near the seam of the fabric. For a chair that was supposed to be high quality it was made pretty cheaply. I then decided that it wasn't even worth exchanging for a new one, so I just returned it. Although it was a cool concept for the chair, it was cheaply made and not worth the $150."
2,too small and uncomfortable,"The chair is too small. When I lay on my stomach, and I am only 5 feet tall, my feet hang over the bottom. The chair is not sturdy and I feel like I am going to fall every time I try to move. The pads on the chair do not line up very well, either."
3,Not what I expected,"The lounger is not suitable for my height (5'10). My legs dangle off and it makes ""lounging"" for very long uncomfortable. If you wear eye glasses and are laying face down your head won't fit through the hole. It also lays pretty close to the ground so getting up from the chair after having been on your stomach is a challenge."
3,no response,"I told my story about my little problem concerning my loungers so why was it not accepted ,is it because it is the truth I'm now home along with the darn plugs that I requested weeks ago that arrived after I went on vac.please respond thanks Ian.Received email from your supplier today denying my request for refund so I'm back to you guys I'm now frustrated at the whole episode,as this could have been resolved by OVERNITING A VERRY SMALL PACKAGE WITH SMALL PLASTIC PLUGS IN IT.Please ,Please respond as for now I'm trying to return these two items before the deadline but all this emailing is just delaying the prossese thanks Ian ."
2,"Not ""aluminum""","I ordered the Ergo Lounger. When I arrived, I was shocked to find that I could barely lift the box that it came in. I wanted to move it to another room to unpack. This was supposed to be lightweight ""aluminum"" but the box clearly said ""steel."" I did NOT want one that would rust because I intended to carry it to the beach to use it. I actually called the Manufacturer (they provided a toll free number) several times. Never did they answer the phone, nor did they ever return any of my calls. So I could not find out if they thought it was aluminum or not. The lounger itself seemed pretty nice, just too heavy and probably would rust soon."
3,great idea but ...,"this is a great product but it is way too short in length and too low to the ground. we exchanged it for the OH version. for a little bit more money, it's so much better."
2,Ergo Baloney,"This is an overpriced, under designed lounger. The concept is cool, the product is not. The idea of being able to read while face down is completely useless if you wear glasses. Very uncomfortable. I am glad I bought mine from Amazon as opposed to the $200 plus other retailers wanted last summer."
1,Playing with Fire is a cold read,"I got this book from the library expecting to read an non-traditional romance, instead all I got was a cliche-ridden, faux literary piece of work. First of all, why do young, attractive women always get involved with rich, older men? I found it totally implausible that Lucy would be in involved with Ben just because he can buy her expensive clothes and keep her up at bicoastal apartments. Plus his stalker-like tendencies before they started dating, should have been a big turn-off to the semi-intelligent Lucy. Lucy, by the way, seems to be a literary realization of the author, who according to the back cover flap was a former model and actress, all female college grad, and jewish rich girl. Next, Shapiro's habit of interjecting flashbacks was so annoying I stopped reading them half way through the book. And the style of addressing the character of Carolyn was extremely bothersome as well. Save your time and read something else."
2,used to taste better!,What the other reviewer said is true - they've changed the formulation of Fruity Booty - (New Flavor!) it says on the Robert's American Gourmet site. Basically took out everything but the peach and mango. It's downright bland compared to what it tasted like before. I used to be addicted. Now I'm not. :(
3,A two centuries - old travelog,Rev. Bolton founded the Pelham (NY) Episcopal Church. This is an account of his travels around and about New Rochelle & lower Westchester County in the 'good old days' when horses or feet got you there.
1,Not as pictured,"Product recieved was not what was shown in the listing. It didn't state that it would be different. If i had known that a substitute would be given, i wouldn't have purchased the item. Especially considering how much it was, i really wanted what was listed."
2,Its huge,"When I got them, I was excited because they were sort of high quality and thick mustaches. Then I started finding bits of hair everywhere. These staches shed like crazy. The worst part about them is that they are huge. I bought fake staches from other sites and party city and they are like regular size that fits all. These staches are like meant for someone who's like over 6'6 with a big head. The best one was the eyebrows because that actually fit my face. I'm 5'9 with I guess a proportional head size.Pros: Funny. ThickCons: Too big. Shed too much."
2,didn't get what i thought i ordered,"I ordered these expecting 12 different mustaches but instead got 4 packs of the same 3 mustaches. Pretty disappointed, and they don't seem like very good quality, but i guess you get what you pay for."
1,Dont Stick,No way to attach them.Very flimsy.These things shed like a mangy cat.You might as well snort a handful of pet hair.
1,These mustaches tried to kill me!,These mustaches were enchanted with evil magic. They tried to kill me. Literally. The also attacked my friends and family. I couldn't get rid of these for days.The magic also probably lowered their quality- the fake hair fell out and got all over everything.The one really good thing about these mustaches was that they were REALLY REALLY REALLY big; your giant friends can use these.
1,waste of money,moustaches do not detach from the paper or come out with the it. You can't apply them this way. No use.
1,Hate it,Not even the same mustaches as in picture! The packaging was not even the same packaging as in this picture!
3,Falls apart with light use,Dont really know how they attached the hair but it seems to be barely attached at all. It falls off in large clumps if you barely even touch it. Also the hairs are glued in all different directions. Half the hair will be glued in one direction then there would be a small clump sticking the other way. Honestly it's a waste of money and almost to the point of useless.
3,Cheap fun,"They are cheap and cheesy, and the fibers come of the mustaches pretty easily, but for the money they were great. I used one for a ""Father Guido Sarducci""-like costume to rave reviews. It was fun!"
4,Tom Selleck to Mr. Pringle to Theodore Roosevelt To Rollie Fingers,"I bought this gift as a gag for a friend of mine. She already had a mustache mug, so I felt that it was necessary to complete her package."
1,?????????,I ordered the item over a month ago and still have not received it. I emailed the company that I order it from and they advised me that I had to wait a month before they took any action on my behalf. Very disapponited.
1,Adhesive? Not so much.,"The variety of styles of mustaches in the set is great. However, they are not adhesive! I bought them for a party and everyone tried to keep them on with tape, gum, bandaids, etc. Nothing worked. There is a film to remove, but underneath is not sticky at all. We tried them all. Not much fun."
2,difficult to apply,"We purchased these for a Mario and Luigi Halloween costume. The moustaches shed quite a bit and the adhesive paper was difficult to remove. Once applied, they did not stick very well. There were no instructions included, but maybe it might work better if skin was first cleaned with alcohol to remove oils."
2,Meh...,"Great idea, and the moustaches look very cool in the packaging, but many of them were impossible to peel off of their backing paper, so they weren't much use in the end."
2,Buyer beware,"WARNING- These are NOT the moustaches pictured!!!!! I bought these and got 11 packages of the 3 same designs (basic moustaches). I was supposed to get 12 packages but only recieved 11. They shed a LOT and are NOT very sticky!! They fell off after about 10 seconds! If you want designs with different styles look elsewhere!! Again, they ARE NOT the ones pictured!!!"
4,Mustache Men,"These mustaches are fun to play with weather you a child or a grown man. My friends and I used them for a bachelor party while we were playing poker. They looked pretty funny on all of us. The only drawback is that a couple styles are a little wide, and the ""hair"" tends to shed a bit. Great deal for the price though."
3,"fun, but adhesive could be improved","I liked all the different styles. The tape tended to not stick when my skin got a little moist from either perspiration or breath, so that was a definite downside to the product."
3,Doesnt stick for long,The glue is not long lasting. It came off after seconds. The hair fibers fall off making the house messy. Disappointed. Poor quality product.
2,They're ok,"These were ok. They got the job done, but man they shed like crazy. I, along with others, had little black pieces of mustache all over them for a good part of the day even after only wearing them for 5 minutes."
5,Fantastic!,"Mustache assortments like this are perfect for events like a Mustachio Bashio! Everyone (or at least people who are any fun) would enjoy a party with real or fake mustaches. An assortment like this is perfect for we ladies who would rather not grow our own, plus anyone who shows up without the mandatory facial hair!"
1,I was sent the wrong item and it was a CHEAP in quality!,"I ordered the fake mustaches that are advertised. I did not receive them. Instead, I received multi-colored mustaches that fell apart upon removing them from the cardboard they were stapled on. Don't waste your time purchasing these. You won't get what you ordered."
1,Cheap price = extremely cheap product,"Just needed 1 mustache for a school project, but this had 12, 6 duplicates which was fine, however, they would not stick to my sons face. Tried double sided tape but still wouldn't work. Hair sheds off of them terribly too. You definitely get what you pay for though. Cheap price, cheap product."
3,Silly Toy to Have a LITTLE Fun With,These were used as a silly gag favor at a party. The kids really enjoyed playing with them. Luckily I had plenty more moustaches than kids because they only last a little while before they start coming off. So then the kids just put on different ones. They had a blast and it entertained them while it lasted.
3,Fake Mustaches,"While it is certainly fun to have fake mustaches at one's disposal, there is one definite problem. There is a great deal of shedding involved."
4,So big!,"So I ordered these as gag stocking stuffers. It definitely created a laugh as we put them on but the mustaches were really big! Everyone that had received a full one was eating the fuzz, because they do indeed shed. I must say that overall they were a good buy, variety was good, adhesive really stuck and very comical."
1,Abysmal mastering job. Shame on Collector's Choice!,"I'm in complete agreement with the other poster who pointed out that Collector's Choice dropped the ball on this one. The sound quality is tinny and shrill, and you can actually here a ""foreshadow"" of Dionne's voice on several of the tracks. How this made it past their quality control is beyond me.If you're lucky enough to stumble upon the earlier Japanese pressing, snatch it up. This reissue will leave you sorely disappointed."
3,Not the best fit..,"This was a good price, but it doesn't fit precisely like I would have liked. The front windows fit good, but the back ones are at least 1.5 inch too big whichi is still okay but I would have thought it would fit more closely."
4,Great product!,"Made of high quality material with very strong adhesive tape. Installs easily, just make sure you are careful in measuring so that you get them where you want them to go. I like being able to partially open the windows in very hot weather or just to provide a little ventilation. As a plus, these vent shades really look cool when installed."
4,"Perfect fit, Easy installation",Perfect fit and easy installation. As far as noise reduction I can't really tell the difference as I don't remember how loud it was before the installation.
1,"Descent Player, BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE",I have purchased several Coby products the last couple of years and have no issues with any of them. I bought a Coby MP-C781 in November and it died last week. I emailed tech support and got a caned response 4 DAYS LATER. The email said to reload the firmware and gave a link to the site. NO FIRMWARE ON THE SITE. So I called support. Took 3 number to find one that worked. They told me there was no firmware for the unit and I would have to mail it back to them with a $6 money order. They had no answer when I asked why the email said to reload firmware even though there is no firmware on the website.I had a similar problem with a Sandisk unit and they only required me to send the unit back and did not give me any hassle and they were very responsive on their customer support emails.I WILL NEVER BUY another Coby product again because of their BAD CUSTOMER SUPPORT.
1,A Disappointment,"I bought this player for my daughter for Christmas and I was so delighted to find a player with expandable memory. It seemed like an answered prayer as she continually outgrows the capacity of previous players. However, from the beginning we noticed that the player ate up batteries like nothing. Even digital batteries weren't much better. Now, 4 months later and the player will not stay powered up and I'm finding more and more bad reviews with the same complaints. That expandable space is of no use to us now!"
1,Do NOT waste your money,"I am very disappointed with this product. It was a gift to my husband. And while he enjoys the fact that he was able to use it as a radio and to listen to his favorite songs, buyer beware it eats up batteries in less than two hours time. I regret the money spent and wish I had just bought an IPOD. YOu really do get what you pay for...only this time had I known about this products defects I wouldn't have even spent a penny! Waiting to hear back from customer service regarding whehter or not they will honor their 90 day waranty to fix or replace it with something that doesn't have the same problem. We'll see."
2,Coby MP-C751 MP3 Player,I would never buy this product. Every time I go to use it I have to put in a new AAA battery. I have spent as much money on batteries as I did on the player itself. I have since purchased a different MP3 player!!
3,"Batteries, Batteries","This is a good little MP3, however, I didn't remember seeing where it used regular batteries. It eats batteries like you wouldn't believe. Dissapointing to my children!"
2,Worked well for about 4 months,"My daughter was so happy to get this for her birthday! It worked well and we downloaded numerous songs for her. She used it a few times every week and carried it with her to keep her from getting bored in the car when I wanted to listen to my music. The last time she used it she put it in her jacket pocket & zipped it up. We really aren't sure why the LCD screen looked like we dropped it in water because it stayed dry. It just stopped working.That's too bad, because it seemed like a nice product. Should've lasted longer than 4 months!"
5,Coby MP3 1GB Memory,The Coby MP3 met all my expectations. I ended up giving it as a gift because my friend needed something easy to use while working out. I plan to replace it with the same item.
4,Everyday Reference Atlas for College Students,"With colleagues I have taught the first term of a huge (800-student) freshman college world-civ class each year for the last twenty years or so. We have always assigned a reference atlas, and although we have tried various ones, this is the book we keep coming back to. It is cheap, indexed, up to date (revised pretty much constantly, although without always changing the ISBN), and sufficiently detailed to be consistently handy. One can always wish for more --it'd be nice if it showed Indian states and made Chinese provinces clearer, for example-- but in these days when it is easy to get additional detail as needed from the Internet, a small, easily grabbed first reference is more important. When we have tried smaller atlases the detail was inadequate. Larger ones seemed wasted because they went beyond most of our needs. This one has always been pretty much ""just right."""
2,Save even more by NOT buying this book,"If you are looking for money-saving advice beyond what any middle class mother already knows then don't bother with this book. You would have to be very profligate in your ways to really get any benefit from the ultra common sense advice Ms. Anahid offers. The book is easy to read and understand. The book is well organized by topic like Travel, Shopping, Automobile, etc. Each chapter is made up of short topics like ""Shop around for dry cleaning prices"" or ""Wash your own car"" followed by a short paragraph of supporting text but there is really no meaty ""how to"" info here; not that there needs to be with such simple ideas. The book is shamefully overpriced for what it offers but if you really don't have a clue on how to stretch a dollar then this book might be worth it. I say save your money and just ask your mom or grandma for ideas on how to save a buck."
1,I'm doing something right.,"I know I'm doing something right to save money when I felt good about borrowing this book instead of wasting a single penny on it. It should be titled ""A Simpleton's Guide to Spending Less""."
1,Wow talk about leftwing Moon Bats!,"Wow, what can one say about someone living in a fantasy world completely devoid of any reality! Never once does he mention the murderous bent of Daniel Ortega and the plight of the native Miskito Indians living in Nicaragua. How about them 12,000 soviet troops stationed in Managua? How about the revolution being exported to El Salvador, Honduras, Costa Rica, Guatemala... Sorry there was no Coke only left wing moon bats who didn't like the US engaging the enemy and wining ....."
1,Conspiracy?,"Truth be told, even ""fruitcake conspiracy theories"" are right occasionally. This doesn't measure up that well. This is an interview with Bobby Nieves, one of the agents working with the Nicaraguan Resistance. Here it is for good and all:""Every stone has been turned. Every page has been written. Everybody who had any knowledge about it has been questioned ad nauseam. There is no story about Contra drug smuggling that hasn't been reported a thousand times by the Kerry commission, Tower Commission, the IG's...There is no story..."""
1,Bound Dreck,Paranoid and partisan? You bet. Another book added to the long list of fruitcake conspiracy offerings.
5,Fantastic historical fiction,"What a great historical romance! My family was visiting from out of town over the holiday and kept asking...""What IS that story you keep reading."" The plot was totally engaging and the ending was satisfying. I don't study Revolutionary War history, but I like reading it. I don't know if all of the fine details were accurate or not, but it sure felt like I was there right down to the corset! The characters seemed so real and I really identified with them. I loved the fact that I sort of figured out who the spy was, but the heroine didn't know. I wanted her to figure it out and see how she reacted, so the plot kept me hooked to the end. I also liked the fact that she got married halfway through the story and it didn't end with one platonic kiss. I hate that! Well worth your while to read this historical. Jill Stengl has never disappointed me yet!"
2,100% used up,I understand that used books won't be in excellent condition. You should expect some handwriting or scribbles. Every single page in this book was written on. I'm wasting time erasing most of the 108 page book when I could be doing the chapter exercises. Each individual seller should be able to add to the item description so that the customer is fully aware of what they are buying.
5,Bread Making for Dummies,This is another good book for bread machines. I love my new Breadman machine. This book is a good guide to help you understand the various types of breads and ingredients.
4,Simpler than Easy Bake Oven!,Great book with easy recipes - and a great way to find out some of the tricks to using purchased bread mixes in a bread machine that would take years to figure out on your own!
4,Fun game for all ages,I really like this game. Even my 4 and 6 year old will play this game. It is also good for adults. It's all about playing the odds.
1,Expired Cartridge?,"this cartridge dried out really fast. (within two weeks) It didn't come in it's original box, so there was no way of me knowing it's expiration date. from now on I'll purchase from a legit epson retailer."
5,truth from the mind of a genius,This book was raw yet so amazing. I could not put it down. I read cover cover in a day. Jason poured his heart and soul into this book of truth and his other writings are just as amazing. He has a true talent and gift spurred on by mental illness. Maybe he should be diagnosed as a mental genius. Well done and i cant wait for the next book!
1,amateur hour,"I have no clue who buys this garbage? Someone gave me a copy on DVD at a video store. he said they couldn't sell any. It is amateur film making, not funny, just a complete mess. And the director :::cough cough::: was the lead actor? That explains everything. This guy should shoot himself in the head."
4,this was hilarious!,I bought this on a whim and really enjoyed it. The cast of characters and their personalities and deficiencies are great. There are lots of laughing out loud scenes!
1,Disappointing... look elsewhere,"I wish the prior review had been here before I ordered this dvd. There isn't any instruction here just a demonstration. This is a really poorly done dvd as well. I have no doubt the instructor knows what he is doing and can exact a great deal of damage but he doesn't teach you how to do it. The internal martial arts have many subtle movements and explanations that are completely missed without at least some discourse. If you know what the instructor is doing you don't need this dvd; if you don't know exactly what this instructor is doing then you wont learn a single thing here. Save your money and try to find a qualified teacher, though it's next to impossible in the u.s. ."
2,Expect more from a $96 book,"While Mr. Adamy may be an expert, apparently these books were thrown together a little quickly. Read the text and all will be well. Follow the example problems in the back and you're headed for a train wreck. When he works the problems they are frought with mistakes, big, blatant mistakes. For someone trying to learn EW the first time these are huge confidence deflators. Find an independent source to check your answers."
2,Sticky label,I love the marker and have purchased it from several sources in the past.. I was disappointed with this purchase because each marker was wrapped in a very sticky sticker which was difficult to remove and then left sticky residue all over the marker. I had to use adhesive remover to remove the residue. I am also still waiting for the back ordered markets that did not ship in the original order.
4,A good book for real estate people starting out on the 'Net,"If you're business is real estate and you want to know whatother real estate professionals are doing on the 'Net, thisbook is a good place to start.With the speed that the internet and the web changes, thebook will certainly have second and third additions, asmost books on the internet do!Scott's book will answer many of the first timer questions,and he has included good perspective from people alreadydoing real estate business over the internet, using web pages,newsgroups and mailing list.Ray DixonWebEstate Global Real Estate Webhttp://www.wegrew.com/"
3,The New Rebellion,"Overall you have to say that this is an enjoyable book allthough I did come away from it thinking, not bad but still not the best I've ever read. The droids were good and as active as ever but I think the storyline is wearing a bit thin now. A new dark Jedi comes on the scene and seems to be more powerfull than ever, Luke sustains an injury but still defeats him. The good thing in this book are the refences to the Jedi Acadamy and occational qoutes: ""Do or do not, there is no try."" (In a Yoda vioce) A good book but only read it if you feel you have to. Read Zhans Heir to the Empire or Shadows of the Empire to get more enjoyment."
2,Too many cheap plot tricks,"First of all, I have to say, I wasn't expecting very much for a Star Wars book. Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge Star Wars fan, and I love the movies, including the most recent one, but I was just expecting a serial novel with some Star Wars content.I got basically that, but one thing that just annoyed me over and over throughout the novel was the authors use of mini-cliffhanger endings for each chapter. Come on! I know that Han Solo isn't going to die, why do you keep trying to build suspense with putting him in a situation where he might and then ending the chapter? The same with Like and Leia, again and again. It would have been so much better if the author had just told the story."
5,Very Good,"This book is very pleasing.You do need to know some things about Star Wars to read this book.If you do not like dialouges,do not read this book.The villian in this story is not a cardboard cutout.Same with the other characters."
2,Disappointing plot ...,"Fellow readers, if you are looking for a good Star Wars book, look elsewhere. While KK Rusch can write well, the plots in this book where an astonishing disappointment. When the technique the villain was using to do his evil deeds was revealed, I had to re-read it as I thought it was an error. While I thought other novels in this series were worse, this book easily had the worst plot. No doubt.I really suggest you look elsewhere for a decent story. I just hope that future Star Wars books that she writes (and I know of at least 1) are significantly better."
2,One boring Star Wars book,"So far this book has been completely without direction and a really confusing story. Not realy sure how this book fits into the Star Wars Universe? Zahn has the empire still in existence but in a rather limited scope from the way this novel depicts things the empire is gone and a few radical elements survive. Which contradicts the other SW novels Dark Saber, Thrawn Trilogy and the last two Zahn novels. There are other problems but why digress. I definately do not like the book and probably will not finish it."
5,one amazing star wars book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,this book is amazing its a fun and great amazing book to read star wars is the best of the best star wars is and always will be the best of the best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Perfect!,"I think this book is one of the best in the Star Wars Universe. It is classic, but still original. I'm reading it again and again, and I don't think I'll ever stop reading it. The language is easy (even for me who originally speak Norwegian), but yet not childish. A person can't call herself/himself for a Star Wars fan without having read this book."
3,"Nice story, bad writing","The plot was actually not bad, considering that some of the political details meshed well with the rest of the novels and the prequel. Sure, it was yet another massive threat coming to destroy the New Republic, but let's face it...when some authors attempted to stray into other territory, they were trashed (Black Fleet, anyone?).On the other hand, I found the book hard to read. The author's writing style leaves much to be desired. Would it kill her to write in complete sentences? And many of her paragraphs were one sentence long. I found the choppy writing style to be very distracting. Also, I dislike authors who feel the need to have dozens of chapters of a few pages each. It disrupts the flow of the narrative.Despite the gripes about the writing style, it was nice to see the author include references to the other novels in the franchise."
1,....boring...zzzz,"I tried to give it a chance, but after 3 long chapters, I had to put it down.In my mind a good SW book is filled with light sabers clashing, deflecting laser bolts, creative ways of using the force, xwings, Sith, Empire, Noghri, Yuuzhan Vong and all that.This book, well for the parts I read, was boring."
2,new Republic too weak!,"In this book, the New Repubic seems So weak! I mean, it HAS fought off the Ssi-ruuk, Isard, Thrawn, and countless others. It is tough, and knows how to fight. And yet, they're letting Kueller do as he wants. The same thing could be said about Luke. He's fought Vader, became a Jedi Master, and its not like he's not training anymore, and yet he is nearly overwhelmed by some unknown Dark Jedi. Besides, why are there any dark Jedi at all? I thought the Emperor and his buddies killed 'em all. Anyway, what I want to say is that THE GOOD GUYS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE TOUGHER, not weaklings like they are in this book. The End"
3,good but could of been better,"The book was good,but,there were certain things in it that made me aware the author did not truly understand the movies.ex.it implied the reason thet obi wan let himself be destroyed was so he could become more powerful and it wasn't a smart thing to do because all he was now was dead,but infact obi wan let himself be struck down so Luke and crew could escape.There are a lot of these types of errors that show her misinterpatations of the films.Also the main villain is a embarassing rip-off of the one and only Darth Vader.A fairly good read once you get past it's flaws"
5,More Great Star Wars Action!,"If you like Star Wars, read this book. It's a fast-paced, action-packed novel that's VERY hard to stop reading. The Star Wars novel series is NOT winding down whatsoever. Those great authors keep cranking out better and better Star Wars action"
4,"Finally, the excitement of a trilogy in one novel","Kristine Kathryn Rusch has accomplished something no Star wars author has been able to do since Kathy Tyers -- create an enthralling story that didn't need three novels to develop. I have loved almost all of the Star Wars book trilogies, but the one-shots always seemed to come up short.The New Rebellion, however, has everything Star wars fans have come to expect -- a fast pace, witty humor, and the characters we all know and love. Rusch does more than just develop the characters, she resurrects them. She recreates Han the Smuggler and Luke the Adventurous. She truly appreciates the depth of the characters of the Star Wars universe.I used to think I had to wait nine months for a trilogy of novels to be published to find a story as enjoyable as the movies... Not any more."
2,"Weak, at best","Not the sharpest knife in the drawer, but it'll cut something. The plot, while starting off well, turned again into a predictble, wimpy-Luke end. When is someone going to treat his character like a MAN- a real Jedi???? I mean, Luke is almost killed by pink blobs from the sky and saved by an old lady?? ARE ANY AUTHORS OUT THERE LISTENING??? Also, What is there in the Force that allows a student go get so powerful that even Vader looks like a wimp. Come-on! Ms. Rusch aparently did not read Lucas' story very well. Pretty pointless book-her only redeeming quality was to write a pretty strong Leia."
4,"great, but not the best","This book was good, but I've read better. The author should have fit Wedge Antilles more into the plot, since he seems to be left out of most books. Yes, the ""worst enemy the New Republic has ever faced"" is a BIT over-used, but the villain was still cool. The only other recommedation would be that I wish there was more of the students at the Jedi academy in the plot. Besides the politics stuff, the plot was quick-paced, making the book a fast read. The plot started rolling right away, keeping the beginning unboring. If you like SW, you should read this book."
5,AWESOME,"This is a great book. My favorite charachter as always is Luke, I wish he would get married though...but keep reading the Star Wars series and he will!"
4,interesting book,"The new rebellion is very entretaining book, but is not like the other Star Wars books.A very good character is kueller, because he is not a simple villian, he want to be the only and powerfull jedi, but as always, the villians fail."
2,"This book not only had no plot, but it made no sense","Not only did this book not make any sense, it was boring. I had no clue what happened in the battle at the end. And since when has Wedge commanded a small armada of Mon Cal cruisers? The Smuggler's Run was also poorly written. overall, this book was pretty much garbage"
2,Why do they allow these titles anyway?,"Once again we have ""the most horrible enemy the new republic has ever faced"" kind of story and it is wearing really thin. I found new rebellion very slow and I don't know if it was the length of the book that made it seem like that or whether it was the writing but it certainly felt like forever for this book to get started. I found the political stuff to be absolutely pointless and the autho had absolutley no way of resolving it as was made apparent at the very end. Another thing that got me thinking after reading this book is that there has not been a decent villain since vader and thrawn. Kueller was so unbelievable and written badly that it was almos a joy to skip over his parts. Anyway I am dissapointed that i bought this book, borrow do not buy"
3,"OK, but uninspired","Though I wouldn't go so far as to call this the worst Star Wars book, I can't call it the best either. The most fitting description is probably generic. The plot involves a former student of Luke's who turns to the Dark Side as a means of exacting revenge for the death of his parents. Following this, he concludes that the weakness of the Republic is to blame and thus decides (surprise) to take over the galaxy himself. Guess where this goes from there.The writing is not terrible, though there has been better. Scenes on Smuggler's Run seem to drag and Kueller himself never seems to feel like a threat. Though he has the Dark Side power he lacks the haunting menace of Vader or the ruthless cunning of Thrawn, and the ""dark jedi out to get the Rebellion"" plot is overused, anyway.Predictable though it may be, it's still a decent read if you need a Star Wars fix. And despite its length, some five hundred pages, it seems pretty short."
2,"Been there, done that","Overall, I suppose I would have to say I enjoyed this book. I never felt compelled to put it aside. But I couldn't help but feel I had experienced all this before. Everything felt like a re-run, either directly from the movies or from any of the numerous novels and comics."
5,The best non-trilogy Star Wars book written to date,"I could tell within the first few pages that this was going to be an awesome book. The pages turned quickly and you were left with suspense that I've only experienced from Crichton novels (Well, Sphere anyway). The novel wasn't bad at all on the characters, and although it's been a year since I've read it, I remember it being very well written and the plot well rounded. The only misgivings I had about the book, I have about every book, and that is the seeming invincibility of all the main characters, no matter how badly they get beaten up in the course of events. However I realize that it would be even less enjoyable had any of the main characters died."
2,DO NOT READ!,"This book was the worst Star Wars Book ever written. Luke is again portrayed as a wimpy mere mortal (hence Children of the Jedi) and the plot was so repetive from other Star Wars book, the only good thing was finding out Kullers secret weapon (and even that wasn't very exciting)."
2,VERY DISAPPOINTED,As the others have said - VERY MISLEADING! I didn't take the time to read the reviews before I bought it - I was looking for Bill Engvall things for my dad for Christmas. I didn't know until today (after he called me wondering if I paid alot for it) that it was only 8 minutes long. He said that what there was of it was enjoyable - but hoped that I didn't pay alot!
3,Not as good as the first book,"I was disappointed with this book. If you read the first one ""Drama Queen"" you should skip this one. The second book was unnecessary. She tries to go back to change characters in the second book and bring one back from the dead in the first. I didn't enjoy this book as much as I did the first one."
1,fooled me 1 2 many times,"I can not believe that I have been had not once, but twice!!!! When I purchased and read drama queen, I was needless to say very disappointed. So, when no more drama came out, I figured everybody deserves a second chance. Therefore, I went out and purchased the book. VERY BAD MISTAKE and a waste of my money. The first book was avaerage. This one, a total disaster. The story had nothing to do with the first one. I mean, you would think with titles like drama queen and no more drama, there would be some similarity to the first book. There were so many characters, I could not keep them all straight. I think that miss hunt has a lack of writing skills, or this was a poor attempt to put real life stories into a fictional setting.(A lot of authors do this). Get it together miss hunt, or you won't be around very long. Of course, this is strictly my opinion only. Afterall, this is what these book reviews are for ,right?"
3,Part One Was Better,"I read, Drama Queen, first and loved it. I was searching and found this book, part two. At first, I could not believe what I was reading. The author pulled the ""Dallas"". If you don't remember, to bring a character back on the TV series Dallas, the writers open the new season as if the entire previous one was a dream.I started to put the book down. I changed my mind and finished it. It was drama filled. It held my attention. Overall, it was a good book, but part one was the best."
2,I can't take No More!!,"Halfway through the book and I'm closing it.... for good. I consider it money wasted. Anyone who chooses to read this is better off NOT reading Drama Queen first. It's almost as if the characters were changed. I thought Anjelica was written off at the end of the first story...(On the day they were supposed to wed, Kayla buried her sister--pg 272, Drama Queen). In No More Drama, Anjelica has magically come back to life with a personality 180 and an explanation for all of her transgressions.. I guess anything can happen in a fictional tale, but can we at least add a pinch of reality?Overall, there seemed to be too much going on in so few pages. I actually needed to use Drama Queen as a reference tool to try and make sense out of this mess. I wasn't successful at all.Lajill, you should skip the ""drama"" all together in your next effort. It's slowly dying and some things can't be recuperated."
3,A little more drama,"No More Drama was good and an enjoyable read. But for those expecting the same momentum of Drama Queen you may be disappointed. NMD does not continue with the perspective of Kalya, but rather her friend/co-worker Terry and his brother Toby aka DJ Terror. Now there's drama amongst this duo as Terry has two soon to be baby's mommas. And Toby is still with Roni, but begins to question their relationship when someone from his past appears. Favorites like Kalya, Day and Geno make cameos, as well as those less than desirable like Craig, std Darla, and an unexpected guest. Good but not as good as the first."
5,Drama To the Second Power,"Ms. Hunt has done it again. I loved this book as much as I did Drama Queen. I like the fact that this book had a different perspective from other characters rather than the same ones, to me that is what made it different and a good read!!! Once again, I laughed, screamed and felt like I knew the people in the book. Compared to some of the lack-luster writers out there, Lajill Hunt's talent shines. She has quickly become one of my favorite authors who gives me something to look forward to reading. You did the damn thing once again Ms. Hunt and I applaud your second book. It was great!!!"
3,Drama Kings...lost in translation,"This sequel just didn't hold a candle to the original. The characters I found so amusing and interesting in the original seemed like a pale or just different versions of themselves in this book. Kayla was an overly judgemental bitch and Roni made me want to slap her. Toby spent 3/4 of the book brooding and fell in love with a character I couldn't connect with. Terrell just was and though his drama at times had me piqued, I still felt like it could have been stepped up. Darla could have had a bigger role and made things more interesting. And finally bringing back Anjelica and making her devil-turned-saint was the ultimate cop out. I just couldn't get into it. I finished ""Drama Queen"" in no time but it took me triple that to finish ""No More Drama."" My advice? Skip the sequel and keep your fond memories of the original."
4,Drama Drama Drama,This book was good it was full off drama as usual. The only problem I saw was in the first book Drama Queen: Angelica committed suicide and in this book she is alive and well. That through me for a loop when I first started reading and then by chapter six I forgot all about that and was in the book full force. LaJill Hunt brought so much drama until it had me looking at my own pass situations.Overall a good book!
2,Wack!!!!!!!!!,"After 2 books, I have realized that I am just not a fan of LaJill Hunt's writing style. Of the two books I read (the other was Shoulda Woulda Coulda) there didnt seem to be any real ""plot"" just a lot of pointless uninteresting scenes that failed to hold my attention. Nothing ever reached out and grabbed me and made me want to keep reading. It's like she just creates these characters, and structures her books on these characters conversations, scenes where they're just hanging out and talking about things IRRELEVENT to the overall story. I am actually shocked that this book has such a high rating, in my opinion, it deserves nothing but 2 stars at the most, and I will never pick up another boring pointless LaJill Hunt book again. (BTW, I gave it 2 stars just to be nice)"
3,confused,"I am confused about Anjelicia. She committed suicide in Drama Queen, how can her character evolve ?"
4,Good Read,"This was a good read. I wished that she would have focused more on Kayla and Geno, but other than that it was good. I hate how Roni and Toby ended up, but that was a great twist as well. I would definitely read more of Hunt's books."
1,Photo does not represent what you get,"The most important reason I needed a Flute Maintenance Kit was for the two cleaning sticks that are shown in this photo. When they were not in the package, I read the contents of the kit a little closer and learned that although the are in the center of the photo, they are not included in the kit. If I had caught that the first time I read it, I would not have purchased it."
3,Rather large earrings,"I purchased this as an extra gift for somebody, and the recipient loved them. When I received them in the mail though, I was a bit surprised by the size of them... They were larger than I envisioned. But they are cute and kind of funky. It depends on your taste."
1,"Great at first, then not worth the trouble","I was given this as a gift for mother's day 04. I have not even had it for a year. For the first couple of months it made great espresso, and I had even mastered frothing the milk. Then it began to leak all the time. I have to keep a measuring cup on the machine at all times to catch the excess. You must always keep it very clean because if not it will take over 5 min to brew the espresso. The milk frother broke completely after a couple of months so I used the microwave to warm up the milk. Today it stopped working all together. It over pressurized after being on for only a couple of minutes, and espresso and very hot steam came out all over the place; it covered the machine, counter, refrigerator, and floor. I was lucky I was not directly in front of it, I would have been burned. This machine is not worth the money; it is not reliable at ALL. What a disaster!!!!!!!!"
1,Horrible,"I have been wanting an expresso machine for a while. I saw this one for like 55 bucks at target so I figured I'd give it a try. I came home right away and started to clean it out like the directions said but for some reason my machine got really hot and started to smoke. The front part (silver plastic plate) actually warped because of all the smoke. Not to mention all the water from the tank started spilling all over my counter. My kitchen smelled like something was burning because this machine was frying itself. Hopefully mine is just defective because I would hate to think that a company would put out such a bad product that obviously is a fire hazard. Oh well. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone. I guess it's true, you get what you pay for. Save your money and buy a better quality machine."
1,WORST MACHINE EVER,"I hate this machine. I have had it for a little over a year now and have had nothing but problems. Problems with the temperature, problems with the steaming and frothing of milk, problems with it leaking. It has never worked properly. Now, it will not even brew an simple espresso. It is absolutely going in the trash, and now I am on my way to my favorite little coffee house for a real cup of JOE."
4,Sooo worth $60 -- but here's another short tip...,"I love the machine. I upgraded from steam to pump. I haven't had any leaks, but I've only had the machine about 2 weeks, and I've made about 50 cups already. My drink is cafe mocha made with Hershey's special dark syrup (not regular chocolate syrup, special dark!) and frothed milk. Since I froth my milk in a graduated stainless steel measuring cup, immediately after starting to steam, I noticed that I miraculously had more fluid than when I started -- obviously a flaw of an inexpensive machine, but here's the work around... I added a step, and now I turn the steam arm on slowly with an empty cup underneath, and about 1 tbls. of water comes out before the steam comes, and then when I know I'm getting nothing but steam (about 5 seconds on low), then I discard the cup with water and put my milk under the arm and turn up the steam pressure. So yummy!"
3,"Good Value, but can be tricky to use","I'll admit it, I'm no cappuccino/espresso addict and/or wizard. I do like a cup now and then, which is why I purchased this machine. The first few cups came out like magic. I was thrilled. About the 4th time I tried to use it, it stopped brewing and water wasn't even getting to my espresso pod. I ended up taking the whole thing apart (because I couldn't just suck it up and call the help phone #, for fear they'd make me mail it somewhere). A few scratches to the machine (and my ego as a mechanic) later, I was still puzzled. I ended up getting really ticked (probably from caffeine withdrawal) and tightening the handle really hard. Turns out that's what it needed. Yeah, I know the instruction manual says not to overtighten the pod holder, but I was so angry and frustrated that's what I did; and it worked! The fable of the story is that this espresso machine is a lot cheaper than others for a reason; I still feel it's cheaply made, but for the price, what the hey."
3,While it lasted...,"I used this daily for 6 months with no problems. When it did it's ""melt down"" I just bought another one..."
1,You get what you pay for!,"This machine stopped working after 3 weeks. The milk steamer is extremely loud and works only when it wants to. Save yourself the headache, don't buy this cheap machine."
1,Not worth the trouble,"I recently purchased this item thinking it was a good value. The fourth time I used it, the faceplate melted off from steam because somehow the water found a way onto the counter instead of into the coffee. I exchanged it for another, but the same thing happened."
2,Doesn't measure up,"The espresso was too weak/thin for my liking. Also, water drips from the pump and frothing outlets and it only makes about one demi-cup of espresso before it needs to reheat the unit."
3,"Good coffee, but I really doubt its durability","I bought this machine a month ago and am generally satisfied with its performance. It's my first espresso machine and it can pull shots with comparable/better quality than the Starbucks down the street when I use my own roasted beans. As a pump-driven machine, it does make some nice crema.Granted, it's one of the cheapest pump-driven espresso machine. You can't expect particularly high building quality. It doesn't look durable. The portafilter housing is plastic. Having a plastic/Alumium sealing that undertake a 13 bar pressure is not a durable solution. It leaks water a little bit once a while. Hopefully it won't break..."
1,Don't Be Fooled,"I read all the reviews for this Espresso Maker, and decided that the good out weighed the bad... WHAT A MISTAKE. I really enjoyed it a first, it was my fist Espresso maker and I was pleased. I followed all the direction to the letter (don't leave the handle attedched when not in use, ect...). but after 3 months it BREAKS!! For no reason at all one day it started to leak a ton of water while brewing and was unfixable. Since it had worked fine at first I no longer had a box and could not return it or send it in. I just threw it in the trash and am on my way out to buy a differnt Maker now. Just thought I'd stop and write a quick review first to warn anyone who cared to listen. Hope this saves you the hassle I've had to deal with. :)"
3,Great Coffee for as long as it lasted,"All the while this machine worked, it made great coffee. Starbucks pods fit well so no mess. Milk warmed with a little froth. Sadly after three months it leaked everywhere. Mr Coffee gladly replaced it but the new machine leaked just as bad. It finally failed completely, quite explosively with water bursting out in all directions, when it was six months old. I have to admit both machines saw a lot of use, 8 to 10 cups a day, so I think I got very good value for money. I might even by the same model again."
1,Save you money and buy the less Expensive Mr. Coffee,"What a mess, as soon as the coffee maker builds enough steam the coffee starts leaking out coffee before the start button is pushed. Only enough pressure to make a single shot at one time. Water still drips thru the coffee pod even after it is turned off. The less expensive Mr. Coffee had the same steam pressure in my opnion."
1,WASTE OF TIME,This was the worst machine ever and leaked from the first time it was used. I used to own $20 steam espresso maker and it worked better than this one. In fact I owned the cheap one for 3+ years and gave it away before it wore out. Don't waste the time setting it up and cleaning it up to take it back.
5,"Camoes, o poeta (the poet)","This here, is what perhaps can be considered the foundry of portuguese literature. Writen by one of the worlds greatest poets, Camoes, retells in verse the story of ""Os Descobrimentos."" Outstandingly well written, and should bring tears to any of portuguese origins."
5,Freddy and the sea,The US Navy in WWII gave me a love of the sea. This CD brings that love to a fever pitch.
5,um.....,"Isismoon2, I think you must have skipped a few parts while you were reading the Koran. Or maybe, you read some fluffy-PC version of it that distorts the original meaning. To help you out, start by reading:4.895.49-5.518.12Great stuff, eh?"
1,Yet another zionist inspired screed.,"The book is essentially preaching to the converted. Empire lovers/Jewish extremists, whether they be conservative,liberal, neocon, marxist will love it as it regurjitates the same old rehased propaganda used to demonize Islam or pretty much anyone who doesnt believe in Eretz Israel (Greater Israel).Offering simplistic and often false answers which characterize and prop up the mistrust between both the Islamic and Western world, the author's own talmudic inspired hatred is no secret. His contempt for facts and support of Israeli terrorism is evident from page 1.Dont waste your hard earned money on this piece of hitlarian nonsense, go read some Norman Finkelstein or Edward Said instead, that this if you're remotely interested in reality."
4,Preachers of Hate,"I will state my agreement with most of the positive reviewers of this book. This is one of my briefest reviews, but the others have explained it well, those who agree with Timmerman.Timmerman has given a riveting and powerful document on the hatred that prevails in the modern Muslim world, particularly the Middle East. You cannot help but wonder where it will all stop. A great many facts and quotes are used in this book to show the malicious state of mind residing in the fundamental Muslim mind there, and in the agenda of world dominance through militancy that the cult of Islam is trying to perpetrate"
5,Classical Comedy at it's best,"Anna Russell is a master of deconstructing the elements of classical music to achieve hilarious results. Both this and ""First Farewell Concert"" give great examples of her talent. A Must Have!"
1,Grainy Picture Indoors - Loud Motor Noise,"I purchased this last week and returned it. The picture (compared to Sony TRV22 in the same lighting) was TERRIBLE! So grainy it looked like a digital effect. I tried all the settings, different tapes and alternate lighting and couldn't get a decent picture.The motor noise is loud compared to 2 other DV camcorders I have owned. So loud it picked up on the mic and transferred to VHS. Not impressed with this, ...If you get this camcorder, save your receipt until you've tested it!!!"
4,Great Little camcorder - Very well built,"It is very light and easy to hold. Great colors, ease of use much better than what I have read. As with all digital camcorders, make sure you black stripe the tapes before using for video editing. Take the camcorder in a dark quiet room, put the blank tape in, lens cap on. Press record and let it do its thing. What you have is a predetermined timeline on the tape that will be there for your DV software to use. Much easier to deal with video edits in this format...."
1,Believe what you read,"I questioned the concerns people had expressed here about the picture quality of the Canon ZR65MC. I bought this camera and was completely disappointed. The reviews were 100% correct. I took it back and purchased a (different brand). It was more expensive, but when I brought it home, the picture was PERFECT! My advice from personal experience...spend a little more and avoid the Canon. You will be disappointed with the Canon - believe it."
1,Don't buy a coby system,"I bought this system for my baby's room. I needed a player that had a repeat function. This player constantly gives a 00 (no disc) code, and it is impossible to get it to play. The advice given by the coby people is to leave the CD door open and unit on to remove any humidity. Even when I do get it to recognize a disk, it then won't play, it spins and spins looking for a track. Then when it finally finds a track it skips and sputters constantly. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY, spend the extra 30 bucks to get a good system. Now, I have to spend double the money to replace this unit, COBY customer service sucks."
3,Disappointed with remote control.,"When I think of remote control I think of ""on/off"" and ""volume up/down"". So I was surprised to find that this remote doesn't do the most important functions of turning the unit on or off and it doesn't change the volume. I will end up giving mine to one of my children and buying something else for me."
4,Cool shelf stereo,"Compact, and well thought out CD MP3 player/radio package, on a budget!Great quality sound in a small package."
1,WTF!?,"As it stands, this book is a piece of ...[junk]; however, if it were about 200 pages shorter it would be decent. The majority of the book is painfully boring. Nothing flows. Throughout a good portion of the book, all I could think was ""Who cares!?"" and ""So what!?"" Some of what is stated in this book is even incorrect. Perhaps if she had included the Dr. prefix, then readers would have expected a more interesting and intelligently written book...."
4,Every company should read this book...,"If you value your bottom line, you can no longer deny the power of WOM marketing -- this book outlines the process and has customer testimonials that will really surprise you!"
1,"In a word, ego","This book is simply an ego boost for the author. I found absolutely nothing I could use in my own business, but wasvaguely impressed with the writers ""word of mouth"" business. I kept reading, expecting to find the secrets to starting my own word of mouth campaign any minute, only to feel that final book readers frustration in the end. No good ending, no secrets revealed, this book is a waste of time."
4,Interesting first book,"Reading the Amazon review that can be summerized with their statement ""intriguing but unconvincing "", I thought I'd add my two cents.I agree that the book is quite interesting and I've passed it around my business to see how it might apply to us. I can't say that the theories are ""unconvincing"" because Balter obviously has proven it works. I ,however, would like to have read more about how others could apply it. The last pages with BZZ agents reports seemed a bit self-serving, but I found the book an easy read that opens up some serious thoughts about this style of marketing."
4,The Newest Form of Marketing,"OK I should start off with the disclaimer that I am also a BZZ Agent. But here is what I want you to first think about if you own a business, are in management of a business or are in marketing. Over the next 24 hours pay attention to all the products and services you mention or that someone mentions to you. It is amazing how often, when you really like a product you mention it to your friends and family and sometimes even to strangers. Ever been in the kids section in Target and have someone tell you that was an awful toy that broke right after they bought it? The power of word of mouth is vital now, especially in this day and time when everyone is a critic with their own blogs. Once you realize how often you metion or hear products mentioned, then come back to Amazon and buy the book."
5,"If you think Word of Mouth Marketing doesn't affect you, you're wrong!","Wow, this book was such a good read and comes highly recommended. I honestly don't think that anyone realizes how much we talk about our favorite and least favorite products in life - cars, shoes, shampoo, laptops, anything! This book is a real eye opener to why people talk/share the way they do and why every company who isn't doing using WOMM to their advantage needs to reconsider their marketing strategy!Overall, the book is so well-written. The author is witty and gives loads of examples, even coming up with a fake product to demonstrate the WOM impact. I loved it!"
4,Not Your Average Dry Business Book,"When I first got this book I wasn't sure I'd really enjoy it. Some of the business books I've read have been so dry and boring. This book kept me engaged until the end with the many interesting examples which Dave Balter highlighted throughout. I had heard about Word of Mouth Marketing, but reading this book gave me a much better understanding and has me looking at things differently. It's kind of a light read as far as business books go. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in finding out more about WOMM."
2,More of the same in a different package,very disappointed for sure. this is a regurgitation of stuff we've been reading forever. Packaged nice in their own buzz words and all but not worth the price and certainly nothing new here.
2,100 word review from guttertype,"From the founder of Bzzagent- a book on how marketing can utilize word of mouth to sell product. Isn't that what marketing is? Filled with field reports and a company history framed within a hokey story. Nothing revolutionary here. Slapdash case studies with illogical conclusions, but a fascinating look at what people will do for free product. The kinder, gentler, more primitive face of Pattern Recognition. Favorite unintentional moment- Balter's defense against William Gibson and David Byrne's criticism by claiming bzzagent's not that kind of company. We were, but we're not now. Oh Tipping Point, see what you have wrought!"
3,Interesting read,"I am a buzz agent so I received a copy of the book to try out. I feel that a lot of the examples given in the book made it an interesting read. I am not sure, however, that I would say that I gained a lot of new knowledge on WOM marketing."
4,buzz of mouth is great,"I normally do not read these types of books but I was given this one and could not put it down. The whole ""sparkling perfects"" model for a product is humorous and great. This should be a must read for anyone who will depend on word of mouth reviews."
5,So Little Time So Much To Say,I have found this book to be an excellent read! Not only have I learned alot about word of mouth marketing. But I didn't realize how much of an inpact that our every day converstions have to other consumers such as myself. We are all directly involved in consumer marketing on a subconcious level and this book brings that idea into true form! Reading this book helps you to actually listen to what you are saying and therefore also helps you listen to the other's point of view. Try to sit back and analyze the last conversation that you had and see how many consumer products were mentioned!
4,"Some Word of Mouth on ""Word of Mouth""","I found this book very readable and practical. Helps us to tap in on and use the power we each have to change and influence the world of marketing. Until I read this book, I didn't realize just how much my friends and I talk about products. I began to think about the ""why"" of buying and what attracts interest, thus how to influence the sales of the products I currently market. Very helpful!"
1,All sizzle very little sausage,"There's about a page of science in this book, padded out with pseudo-folksy hot air in the form of caricature-like ""case studies."" You'll find the same quality in their website. FAR BETTER CHOICE IS Dr Lee's ""What your doctor may not tell you about menopause."" Dr Lee's website is more factual, less filler. CAVEAT don't sign up for the ""special offer"" to get your saliva tested and then get Dr Randolph to consult - you won't get him, you MIGHT get someone as far up the line as a nurse practitioner and you won't get any information you couldn't get from Dr Lee's book."
3,"Catchy title, but...","You'd think with a title like Hormone Hell, there'd be a revelation inside the book, especially being published rather recently. There's no revelation. This is all old news. And there are better books that address the subject. If you haven't done your research yet on hormones and BHRT, this would be a good place to start, but again...better books abound. Dr. Randolph is also pushing his own progesterone cream...go figure."
3,"Learn by watching, no written music included","This DVD is useful to the student who learns best by watching the instructor, rather than using a book with dulcimer tablature with a companion CD. The close-up camera angles of David's playing demonstrations are very good. He takes the student through a song, one phrase a time. Before the era of self-taught books and instructional CD and DVDs, this is reminiscent of the days when the experienced musician would pass along their knowledge (one-on-one) to the novice musician. This also enforces the student to memorize the song while learning the song, rather than becoming dependent on the sheet music. I believe a student can learn many things by watching another musician. Therefore, if for no other reason, I recommend this DVD for the purpose of aspiring students observing (and absorbing from) a very fine mountain dulcimer player."
2,Not what I expected,This video is strictly 'picking' and not 'strumming'.. It teaches you to play it like a guitar....
5,Good stuff,"I'm not sure why 4 pieces of plastic should be so expensive. I've used this same type on many vehicles in the past, and only once had one come off. That was on a vehicle I bought with them already installed, so who knows if they were installed correctly. This is a good product."
3,Casillo film,very interesting film. Am going to keep it in my collection and watch it every few months. A bit dark but that is the way it was intended.
3,Engaging southern romance,"Tim Gautreaux's debut novel is a fine romance set in Tiger Island, Louisiana. Colette and Paul Thibodeaux have been married for about a year when Colette gets restless and dreams of a world bigger than the ""small muddy pond"" that they currently reside in. She leaves Paul and moves to California, and Paul reluctantly follows. The story moves somewhat slowly in the beginning, but quickens its pace after they leave California (with Paul having gotten Colette pregnant) and return home to their now-impoverished town. Colette as a character often comes across as a whiny brat, but she redeems herself by the story's climax. Paul is written as a simple country boy with a heart of gold; it seems that he can do no wrong. I would've liked to have seen him with some personality flaws that would make him more than two-dimensional. All in all, though, it's a well-told story."
1,Over plotted does not even BEGIN to describe it!,"Being from Louisiana and having lived here all my life, I tend to read with a more critical eye books set in the great state. This book was VERY over plotted and full of ""charming Louisiana"" expressions. GIVE ME A BREAK! Not everyone eats gumbo for every meal and shoots nutria in the bayou, ya'll. Books like this are just one of many reasons why ""outsiders"" think we are all backwards and sit around sucking on crawfish heads all day. I felt like I wasted my time for 340 pages of nothingness."
2,T-352 DOES NOT DECODE DTS according to A-MW,"I was very let down to hear from Amphion Media Works that their T-352 does not decode DTS. The users manual says it will... Amazon.com, Circuitcity.com and www.a-mw.com !! web pages say it will!! I can't believe that this thing has been selling and that no reviews made note of this fact. I was excited at first about this unit... it didn't sound bad... but the sound of silence when I select DTS on a DVD is deafening."
3,Decent sound but major AV input problems,"There is a rather annoying problem regarding the A/V inputs which I initially thought was originally a defect in my particular unit. However, it seems to be a problem with all T-352 models. When the function is set to Audio/Video, the subwoofer rumbles rather annoyingly, even when nothing is plugged into the inputs. If you plug anything into the inputs, the sound still remains, and the only way to get rid of it is to set the bass volume to 0. I don't know if it's a problem with the subwoofer or if it's just a feature, but the sound is nice and clear (with no low rumbling) when playing a CD or DVD directly through the unit. If you plan to connect your video game consoles or computer to these speakers, however, do prepare to be annoyed."
3,Ok system for the price... major problems with AV inputs,"I'm fairly happy with this very low end system. They manage to pack a lot of features and fine adjustments into a really inexpensive unit. If you're looking for big sound, go elsewhere, but for a small room, it's fine. I found it a bit tinny, but at least it's crisp.I don't really care for the remote though.There is one major flaw I have found it, and it seems to be a ""feature"" rather than a bug, which unfortunately will ultimately force me to return the system and settle for a lesser system even though I liked this one better. The AV inputs seem to be corrupted. The sub rumbles when the AV mode is switched on, and seems to get worse whenever a connection is added to it. I thought this was a defective unit, but I returned it for a replacement, and am still having the same issue. :(It's too bad about the AV input issue, otherwise it's a really nice inexpensive DVD player/5.1 decoder."
3,"Worth the cost but AV1, AV2 are problematic","I just set up mine yesterday. It sounds great, dvds sound excellent. Plays everything including SVCDs but on certain scenes the picture starts scrolling and you cannot do anything about it. Sound is more than good enough for a small room.Problems with AV:I connected my VCR/Cable TV through AV1/AV2 but now sometimes the colors appear too bright or the picture starts scrolling on certain channels. But if I connect VCR/Cable to TV directly then they work fine. The remote control does not control anything else and no universal remote control works on this dvd player. AM/FM tuner is great but, the subwoofer doesn't work while playing FM. MP3 and all TV channels sound great with SUB. Overall its worth the money($80) on sale. While watching Cable TV I take video signal which comes directly to TV and sound from this system and the combination is great."
2,about AUX input and Optical Input,"Hi:I got this system on July, and I try to use use AUX input from my other CD and TV, but my AUX input just won't work...Really frustrated...Right now, i try to test if my Optical Input work or not. IS any one try to input use optical input and decode 5.1 speaker?Thanks"
2,Cheap/good features/poor sound quality,I hooked this up to my Samsung 32 HDTV and the sound from the Matrix Reloaded almost melted the speakers. The system does not have the power to adequately drive the subwoofer to produce punch at any reasonable sound volume. I was very disappointed and will be returning this system to trade up. The feature set was good and setup was rather easy. Remote is VERY CHEAP
2,"Good sound for the price, until it broke","I bought one of these last July. Although not the best sound, I thought is was very good considering the very low price. In November it the audio stopped working in the middle of a movie. Circuit City only warranties it for 30 days, after that you must speak (more accurately try to speak) to AMW. It's now February, still broken. I suppose the lesson is you get what you pay for... low price = low quality."
1,Only two front speakers work!,"The sound is good. But it comes only from the two front speakers no matter what it plays(CD/DVD/VCD). Is there a trick to set up the audio system right? I might have to return it if I can't figure out how to make all the speakers talk. Also, the remote does not work very well. You have to press very hard.BTW: I did use the test mode and all the speakers seem to work fine."
2,"Interesting Information, Not An Exercise Video","I have the typical middle-aged ""bad knee."" An old high school injury and years of just living have taken their toll. I expected that this video would provide exercise routines for knee rehabilitation. Well, it does -- sort of. Lots of great anatomical information, a demonstration of how to do some movements to strengthen leg muscles, but no actual ""now let's do it"" section complete with the instructor keeping count of repetitions, etc.Bottom line: I would not recommend this if you want to do daily exercises for your knees."
3,Knee rehab,This program requires the use of small yoga balls that do not come with the DVD nor can I find them on amazon. Misleading! Too bad since the exercises seem ok.
5,Recommended for Runners Knee,I have patellofemoral syndrome (runner's knee). Most workout DVDs I don't like because there is too much I can't do. These exercises were really good and seem to get most of the muscles that effect the knee. I can really feel the muscles working without hurting my knee. There are three levels which is really helpful. I would definitely recommend this.
2,Fun to watch but not structured to follow as excercise,"Jill Miller is a Yoga Instructor so a lot of the exercises are very Yoga oriented and non-conventional. While it is fun watching her do the moves, there are so many of them and so much information that it will be extremely hard to follow as an exercise as a routine. It also seemed to me that she is making a lot of this stuff up so I am not sure how much science there is behind them as opposed to more standard knee exercises practiced by physical therapists and thought by hospitals, universities, etc. I found the DVD called ""Strong Knees"" by Chantal Donnelly much more helpful for my knee exercises. If you purchase this DVD, to perform the routines, you will need Yoga Balls, Yoga Bricks, and a net two hold two Yoga Balls together."
1,Out of date ink,"From the product description I expected this to be a fresh ink cartridge. The description even included a statement about the expected shelf life of this cartridge. These were several years out of date, nothing near fresh. They didn't even feel as new ink would when shaken in the sealed pack.On the good side, my money was immediately refunded, no questions, no problems. I was not even required to return the old cartridges. A not so honest sales pitch turned out ok, nothing lost but time."
1,Epson Inkjet Cartridge (Black) (S189108/S020189/S020108),"Epson Inkjet Cartridge (Black) (S189108/S020189/S020108) is a great price and was received byTrinity Fusion Enterprises, LLC (Texas Angel) quickly (processed by Amazon). Unfortunately the cartridge was not in retail packaging as shown. This would have been OK as I thought maybe this was OEM packing. I suspected otherwise when I found the cartridge within the external pack did not have the usual vacumm mylar sealed wrap. Also, there was no expiration date as is typical with all Epson cartridges. On the outside of the package a label with the Epson p/n's and a label that said ""New"". To be safe I did not install but returned and a refund was promptly issued."
4,Kaffe Fassett's Museum Quilts,Wonderful use of colour and the use of the old designs. He teaches you to look at the detail for inspiration and yet interprete it in a new way.
5,Chad's life is an inspiration,"Chad's book has inspired many people who look to him as a role model. His book reflects on how important a good moral and religious foundation is to the development of a true winning spirit, whether on the field or off. Small town Iowa does not afford you many chances. But Chad set his sights on his dream, figured out what it took to acheive them and then took action, while keeping his foundation in the Lord. Chad continues to remember where he came from, and has not let his position in the NFL cloud who he really is, and what is important in his life."
5,in one word - Outstanding,"Chad Hennings speaks from the heart - the heart of a godly man. Life has many things in store - highs as high as winning the Superbowl and lows as low as seeing your child wrought in crippling pain. Yet through everything, there is one constant - Jesus Christ is always there for you and everyone who calls on his name. Chad is an awesome individual - not for his football abilities, but for his commitment to Jesus Christ and his family."
2,POOR EXAMPLE,"I did not like this book as it did not give me too many good examples of cover letters I also found it geared towards the industrial professions, I found it too tedious. I would not recommend this book to anyone who is just coming out of school."
2,Not Really Contemplative,"The book is difficult to read, at best, and although I did find some helpful ideas, it is not a book on Contemplation, much less on the contemplative heart. It is more a treatess on psychology of the contemplative. Most of the book deals with meditation not comtemplation. The author made no attempt to really deal with the difference between meditation and contemplation. If you are interested in anyalyzing the contemplative from a clinical psycologist viewpoint then this might very well be the book to help you. But if you are trying to understand your own heart and move further towards God, this is probably not going to help. Plus his use of words and thoughts are very cumbersome. I have thrown my book in the trash."
4,Strappy greek frye sandals.....,"They ran a little small and I had a no fuss return from amazon for a larger size,new shoes are great and very well made,will wear all summer!Only tiny complaint is how soft the leather sole is - it is already pretty scuffed up, not a ig deal and love the shoes!"
4,Great product for the price.,"Good, even coverage - no puddles. Plan to buy more. Convenient way to water a long narrow strip of lawn in one ""application"" - complete coverage in less time."
1,IF I CAN RATE IT WITH A ZERO I WOULD,"THIS HOSE AFTER SETTING IT UP ALL ALONG MY GARDEN PATH WAS FINE FOR TWO WEEKS OR SO -- AFTER THAT, IT SPRANG UP HOLES MUCH CLOSER TO THE SPIGOT AND I NOW HAVE A LOT OF WASTED WATER NOWHERE NEAR MY FLOWERS. I ALSO NOTICED THAT IT STARTS SPRINGING NEW HOLES ALL OVER THE PLACE AND IT MAKES MORE OF A MESS. THIS IS REALLY JUNK. DO NOT BUY."
2,Does not last,This hose only lasted a month. I had it hooked up with the timer and flow control. After 1 month it started to burst. Spent more money on duct tape then the hose.
1,They don't make them like they used to.,"I used to buy Gilmour hoses a very long time ago (40 years). They worked great back then & lasted for a very long time. Recently, I ordered one & it developed a hole the 2nd time I used it. Am very disappointed & won't buy this product again. It was a waste of money."
1,Sprinkler Hose,"Hose is defective and leaks, more water comes from bad hose then sprinkler holes. Will never buy from them again."
2,Gilmour hose poor quality,"This hose split at both ends on the first day I used it. I was able to duct tape both ends and use the hose. Had it not been a sprinkler hose it would have been useless because it still leaked, but this just made the leak like the other holes in the hose."
2,Leaky,"After 2 weeks, it leaks near each end. It is poorly contructed.But, since it is a soaker hose that I buried, I use it anyways. A little extra water on the plants near the faucet should not hurt."
5,Upconversion looks FANTASTIC!,"I had my doubts about this DVD player since it was sub $1000 and promising a deal of features. But after a little adjustments, I now watch all of my movies in 1080i (upconversion, so I'm sure that it would still be better if it were true HD) But again, for the price and knowing that I own multiple dvds that are not recorded in HD, this player does what I need. It gets displayed onto a 50"" Pioneer Plasma and looks wonders above the RCA component DVD player that used to run into it. Very fast delivery on Amazon's part (before actuall expected date.) If you are looking for upconversion through component, the newer models of this remove that feature, but with a few searches on the internet you can find an older firmware to get your upconversion back. This flash however will mess with the DVI outputs looks, but no need to worry if you are not using DVI. If you did decide to use DVI you can just download the newest firmware and reflash the system.I hope this helps."
5,Excellent DVD Player,"I purchased this DVD player a few months ago (from a different source) to replace my old DVD player when i bought my new 57"" widescreen TV. It is an excellent player and can output in 480p, 720p, or 1080i. it is one of the few players that can output these through both component video AND DVI. the quality is excellent and all cables (DVI, Component Video, s-video, optical audio, rca stereo cables, etc) are provided in the box.if buying this product, some research would be beneficial regarding the prices and additional function of this dvd player"
5,"Great DVD Player, but BAD Amazon","I order and got this player from ""Amazon"", not a reseller on Amazon. It is listed as NEW, but I got an open box item, and possible refurbershiped. So, I called and Amazon send me another one to exchange it. You know what the second one is the same same. Both box is all scratched and bumped due to what looks like excessive shipping and handeling. This is a nice upcoverting player but I would not buy it from Amazon."
2,Reliability an issue,"Got mine 2 days ago. It does the upconversion to 1080i well. I have it connected via my receiver to a projector. Unfortunately, it is the most unreliable DVD player I've seen. Freezes up at any given time. Has skipped a couple of time while playing. Constantly have problems reading a disc (CD/DVD)when first inserted. I still have not finished a single DVD movie on this one. May be a dud. I'm having it replaced with another one from Amazon. Hopefully the next one is not another lemon. I will update when it arrives and have tested it.Update: The new one I received works great. Have it now for over a year. One of the few DVD players that does upconversion over component."
5,DO NOT BUY FROM CAIMAN - RIPOFF SELLS USED CD's AS NEW,"CD is great, but CAIMAN merchant is a ripoff, they listed the item as new, came opened - used, emailed them NEVER got a response.. Buy from reputable merchant."
1,Ford Escape 2012 rain guards,I bought these for my Ford Escape 2012 SUV. They are too big and thus do not fit my car. They are attached via mounting tape and seemed like they might have worked OK if they had been the correct size. I pulled them off and am throwing them away. I have ordered a set of in-channel ones that I am hoping will be the correct size for my vehicle.
3,"Decent Product, Horrific customer service from AMAZON.COM","Product was decent quality however customer service received from AMAZON.COM has been horrific. Would not recommend to my worst enemy, good luck if you have any problems as amazon will do nothing for you!!!"
5,pretty plate,I love the design of this salad plate.The pistoulet design mixes well with my other dishes for a casual every day look.Pfaltzgraff pottery is excellent quality
4,good informative book,this book contains alot of really good information to get you started. it has really been helpful. I especially liked the case histories of actual farmers/growers doing this.
4,"Awesome series, Shoddy release","First off, love ""Dallas,"" and have even loved the DVD releases put out by Warner Bros. -- until this one. It seems like the picture quality has gone down quite a bit from the previous DVD releases and I'm guessing it has to do with Warner Bros. cramming eight episodes onto one disc instead of having six episodes per disc as they have done previously. In order to do that, you would have to compress the episodes even more resulting in poorer picture quality. And that, Warner Bros., SUCKS! This is the kind of crap companies pull that keep consumers from buying cds and DVDs. They cut corners, put out an less than stellar product and sit there scratching their heads wondering why sales are down."
5,Wow,"I was very curious before watching this season for the obvious reasons. Different producers and writers, and of course the changes in the cast since the end of the eighth season. I am not totally through with this season yet but what I saw until now is very, very interesting. I enjoy watching the beginnings of the new storylines. Also the ""newer"" characters, especially Barbara Carrera and Dack Rambo get interesting parts. Naturally I already know how it will conclude because it was not possible to avoid the cliffhanger but I still like this season. Cheers to y'all."
3,Dallas- The complete ninth season,"As a fan of Dallas i eagerly awaited the release of Season 9 and true to form i wasn't disappointed, it was good to see the original Ellie (Barbara Belle Geddes) back again and JR up to his usual tricks, as someone who never watched it when it originally aired on TV i was shocked at how the last episode of the season where.........Did you think i was going to give that surprise away......A definite must watch."
1,Dallas Season 9,"Dallas, Season 9, had a very disappointing ending...although I had read ealier what the ending was. But after watching the whole season, felt it was a waste, since the whole season was ""merely a dream."" I'm sorry the writers couldn't come up with a better way to bring Bobby back...perhaps a fake death to protect him from some unforeseen danger...they're the writers, not me. Nevertheless, I look forward to season 10, and hope it has the impact and enjoyment that seasons 1 through 8 had."
3,"The controversial ""dream season""","It's not spoiling anything for Dallas fans (and who else would purchase the entire series on DVD?) to say that this is the year that the producers decided to turn into a season-long dream by Pam (a very long and involved dream!) once they were able to lure Patrick Duffy back to the role of Bobby Ewing, inconveniently killed at the end of the previous season. Meanwhile, we get the late Dack Rambo filling in a bit for Duffy as the macho good guy Jack Ewing; Barbara Bel Geddes returning as Miss Ellie (after a season's absence, during which the role was played by Donna Reed); and guest star Barbara Carerra, exotic, mysterious, and flamboyantly dressed as Angelica Nero. The absence of good guy Bobby as a foil caused nasty J.R. to actually find himself on the side of the angels at times. Sue Ellen has a great story arc that takes her literally from the gutter to a newfound happy marriage with J.R. Collectors will, of course, want to add this to their library."
3,hit and miss year,"the death of Bobby and then the return at the end of the year of Bobby left me in the cold and for the first time Dallas didn't feel as Innovative as it once had and it felt like it was following the trends as to setting them. everything else was in play,but Dallas started coming across like it was copying ""Dynasty and Knots Landing and other things. it was starting to lose it's own idenity during this particular season. of course the season had some good moments,but you really appreciate Patrick Duffy a whole lot more when you see the show without him. that whole Shower scene and whatnot is the Big time ""Jumping the Shark"" which to me Dallas was never quite the same again."
5,Forgot about this series,We were searching Netflix and discovered they offered Dallas. We began renting the DVD and realized we wanted to certain season to our collection. Fun entertainment.
1,"RATING THE DVD QUALITY, NOT THE SHOW","I absolutely love the show. However the quality of the DVDs were terrible. I had pixels and skipping through BRAND NEW DVDs. I was hoping to resell them after watching them, but that won't be the case as I would not want anyone else to have such poor quality of a product. I got no resolution from the seller because they said it was past my return time. The thing is, who sits down and watches an entire SEASON in the length of time they give you for returns? No one. So I am stuck. Did anyone else have these issues with the DVDs? I would love to know. I also purchased season 3 and season 7 and had the same issues. I had two episodes in season 9 that would not play AT ALL."
3,Dallas Season 9 was alright,Dallas season nine wasn't the best season of Dallas. Compared to the first eight seasons Dallas season nine was not as thrilling as the rest!
3,Dallas at its best,"interesting season, acting is better than average, Sueellen has become a terrific person in this season sober, working for the non profit as a fund raiser, which is a perfect job for her. Glad to see Barbara Bel Gettes back as Ms.Ellie,Donna Reed did not fit the role. Pan;s role is a bit unusual going to COlumbia to emeralds, that is far fetched. all in all an enjoyable season"
5,fantastic cd,"I have played this CD over and Over again in my store. out of all the music that I play (Claude Challe) Lounge and chill Cd 's of various types, This one by far has been ask the question, What is playing and where can I get it.I love this Cd."
4,Not as good as Thievery Corporation,"Some songs are more inspired than others: I heard Gabin vs. Cal's Bluedo in the music store and bought the album, but some parts of the CD are just plain cheezy. The beginning of La Maison and Mille et Une Nuit des Desires are boring, elevator-music-ish crap-ola. But overall, it's groovin."
4,Very Classy.,"As a CD that playfully weaves together jazz influences, mellow house, and chilled electronica, the debut from the French act Gabin is a record for almost any occasion. Jazz lovers will nod their heads in approval for ""Gabin Vs Cal's Bluedo,"" which tastefully gives an electronic update to Cal Tjader's instrumental. Those who want to get their disco on will find a home with ""Doo Uap, Doo Uap, Doo Uap,"" which samples the familiar lyric ""it don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing,"" as well as the housed-up ""Mille et Une Nuit des Desires."" And listeners who want to set a romantic tone for the evening will find pleasure in the lovely ""Urban Night"" or the finale ""La Maison."" This is classy stuff; French electronica with laid back vibes and occasional nods to jazz. But don't mistake it for the blandness of Kenny G.; this is well-crafted mellow pop that provides a soundtrack to urban sophistication."
1,Not good. Almost bad.,"I bought this because of how much I loved Gabin's latest work (Mr. Freedom). Conversely to that CD's originality and all around fun, this one plays like bad elevator music. This is terribly, terribly dated, bad music."
3,Ow.,"I use this with Dragon NaturallySpeaking, and it's proving much better than my last two (more expensive) headset microphones. Accuracy and noise cancellation is good. However, I literally just had it on for 5 minutes, and half an hour later, my head still hurts where the ""non-ear-side"" was. I have a small head like other reviewers, yet this was just awful! I'm definitely going to have to pad it myself. I'm going to try gluing some memory foam to the spot where it rests on my head. Wish me luck! The other side with the ear is comfortable, and it meets my needs functionally, so aside from that issue, it's a very good value."
4,WORTH THE MONEY,"MY SON LIKES THE HEADPHONES, APPARENTLY HE HAS BEEN ABLE TO PICK UP POLICE ALERTS ON THE WIRELESS SYSTEM, WHICH IS A PLUS!"
1,Not USB,I had searched for a cheap USB headset and this one showed up in the results. The product description does NOT include the connector type (should have been my first clue). I just got this yesterday and it is a standard 3.5 mm jack. I needed a USB.Quality wise it's OK for a cheap product but be aware that it is not USB in case that is what you are looking for.
3,Internet Gaming,"It is not meant to be a high tech, state of the art headset. It functions well for its price and has a long life. I haven't had any issues with it shorting out or anything that typical headsets of this value usually have so that's a plus in my book. Its got a puffy padded ear piece which I would rather not have, but that is a personal taste. All in all this is a decent headset for the price if you are in need of something quickly."
1,Same story: loss of video,We have also had our just over one year old ZR70 lose the ability to capture video. The screens display the text features on start up but where the video feed should appear it just stays black. It was also only very gently used with no traumatic events. This is a most frustrating development that it appears others are also experiencing and calls into question the manufacturers reliability and customer service.
2,Surprisingly dissappointing,"Got it from a local store and tested it for a few days. Based on specs alone, this camcorder has, far and away, the best bang for the buck. However, I was really surprised by how BAD the video quality is. The grain is just plain awful, even in bright light. It seems like there is some kind of digital noise being injected in the video, indicating that this is some kind of manufacturing defect. I've read reviews of other Canon mini-DV camcorders with the same problem (like the new Elura 50) but the problem seems to be persistent with the ZR70. Some users submitted reviews of the ZR50 which is an OLDER model and probably better. I also based my purchase decision on a neighbor's experience with a ZR50 and believe me, the ZR50 (at least my neighbor's sample) doesn't have the grain problem.Also, the motor noise is bothersome. Its definitely being picked up by the mic and is more noticeable than subtle. I exchanged it for a Canon Optura 20, which I'm very happy with."
2,Disappointed,"I bought the ZR50MC in January and was somehat pleased. The camera has lots of features and is well designed (fit and finish). However, there were problems. The video quality was poor compared to other competing cameras. The sound, while accurate, was annoying in the way the camera's motor noise was picked up on the tape. So I decided to return the ZR50MC when the ZR70MC was announced. I thought for sure that these things would have been addressed in an updated design. I bought a ZR70MC and found that some additions had been made, but none of the probelms had been addressed. The video was still poor, the stills were better and the sound was still a constant buzz. I wanted very much to like this camera, but I ended up sending it back as well."
2,Canon ZR70 is not the camera it should be,"I bought the Canon ZR70 and had it for less than a week. It's very poor in low light, even inside our home with lights on. For some reason it just doesn't have enough low lux for this camera. There's alot of bells and whistles, but that doesn't make up for the disappointing results when using this camera. I switched to a JVC which was a bit more expensive but have seen a big difference in lighting, although I believe most digital camcorders probably need a accessory light to help.."
1,Do not waste your money,"I bought this camera 2 years ago--used it minimally, babied it --never took it anywhere but home--used to tape my puppy when she was small. After almost no use it stopped rcording --just when i wanted it for the birth of my baby! Screen just records black. Sent it all the way to canada to fix--payed alot--and still 9 months after the birth of my baby it's not recording again!!! i do not live in a country with a canon center and to get it to canada (where it was bought) was a haasle. please so not buy this or any other canon camcorder. My cousin has one that is a slightly older model and has sent it for repairs twice. i dont know if what the reviewer for manila said will work but I will try it if i ever get this camera back to canada again!"
3,three star,"Pros: Handy in size, easy to use, good lensesCons: Records its motor noise, not realy good at for night shooting, or in really dark environments. Don't expect much about supernight mode."
1,Completely letdown,"I bought a Canon comcorder in 1992 that was worlds better than this. If you are shooting ONLY In daylight, and I mean ONLY in daylight, then this camera might please you. I on the other hand want to able to shoot in all kinds of light - and this camera fails miserably in anything other than daylight. The grainy, sub standard picture was a total disappointment. I am sending mine back, and looking into other products."
3,Solution for Dead ZR70's,"Gentlemen,I recently found out that Canon has a worldwide recall for ZR70 and similiar models. I got my ZR70 repaired for FREE. Check out your nearest Canon Service Centers. I am based in Manila, Philippines, they did it here, for sure they'll do it there in the States.Problem starts with the wiring that connects the CCD, it overheats and lossens. That's the reason why the recording just goes dead.No questiona asked, even never bothered asking for warranties and where i got it. Just gave me a receipt and told me come back after 2 weeks.Hope it works for you guys."
4,Repair Service,I presume people had problems with this product (ZR70MC).I guess most of them are CCD related.I owned ZR70MC since 2004 and I noticied CCD problem recently (Camcorder LCD went blank even when lens cap is removed) and one year warranty on product had already expired.Canon customer service was efficient and they repaired it free of cost (they even provided shipping label).When I received camcorder I noticied that record button is not working. Canon customer service or repair center again came to my rescue and they repaired it free of cost (they even provided shipping label).I rate their customer service as best.But as some one noted earleir this camcorder doesn't perform well in low light conditions.
3,Unacceptable motor noise in an otherwise good product,"This was the 3rd camcorder I tried. I wanted something that was quiet and had a decent LUX. It shot fairly well in low light situations but the motor noise was too loud. Very high pitch. When playing back, low noise scenes were dominated by eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee at a high note. Too bad. I liked everything else. Circuit City was great about returning it, as usual.I finally went with the Sony TRV22 (4th one I tested)."
1,Same thing... it just died.,"Like the others, this camera just up and died on me one day. I hope to get Canon to repair it, as it was pretty decent while it worked!"
2,horrible with low light,"i used this camcorder indoors for a recital and the picture quality was just so poorly, that the tape was useless. Luckily i used a 4 year old Sony DV as backup, where the picture quality was superb, compared to Canon. I think Canon ZR70 is ok for outdoor usage and greatly priced. On the positive side, i like the great zoom and the ease of use. I think its a good Camcorder for starters or for creative Kids. The Remote is poorly as well, the buttons are so small and not good aranged and hard to find."
1,Terrible image,"This camera is loaded with features and is cheap. Those are the only good things. The indoor quality is awful. I would shoot at 10AM in a well lit room and it was terribly grainy on a 32"" TV. Our old Hi8 Sony and our digital camera shoot better video than this. You choose which one insults it more. AVOID THIS CAMERA. I have two exellent still cameras made by Canon, so I am not telling you to avoid Canon, I am telling you to avoid this camera. It is terrible. Do not even consider this camera. When the reviews say ""low light"", that refers to ANYTHING indoors. The room I shot about as bright as it can get, and the lights were on. TERRIBLE CAMERA AVOID THIS CAMERA AT ALL COSTS. Ignore the positive reviews, they either never shot indors or have never seen the picture quality yet. If they did they too would be with me giving it one star. I'd have given 5 stars but the picture quality is 9999999999999999% NOT ACCEPTIBLE. Avoid this camcorder like the plague."
4,hopeful,I am only giving a four star rating so far. Just purchased the camera. It feels good and it seems very sturdy. Some of the buttons are a little hard to use but i am sure i will adjust. Have not used the software yet. So far i am impressed.
2,Good camera but POOR indoor picture quality,"I purchased the ZR-70-MC after reading several reviews and studying several other camerass. Initially I was very pleased with the result-outdoors, that is. In sunlight the camera produces excellent picture with great color and crisp outlines. However, indoors the picture becomes grainy and very digital. After studying the manual and trying several different modes and manual adjustments, I was able to improve the picture somewhat, but not to a satisfactory level. I then purchased a Sony TRV-19 and compared them side by side. Feature-wise, the Canon ZR-70 wins. However, the picture quality of the Sony was MUCH better. The Sony was crisp and colorful both indoors and outdoors. It had a much more advanced image stabilizer and focused much better when zooming. I am sending the Canon back and keeping the Sony TRV-19."
3,An okay entry level digi camcorder,"Good:1)The various editing & filming functions of the camcorder.2)The controls are easy to use.3)Zooming and wide angle function4)Compact and light.5)Nice remote control functionBad:1) The motor noise is still present! (you can hear it in the recorded mini-DV tapes)2) The image stablization is not always present.3)Takes awhile to auto focus during low and night-time conditions.4) To utilize the msn messenger video option, you need exclusively Win XP OS.NOTE: Please don't expect any digi camcorders to take good still pictures, including this one. Afterall, it's main purpose is to film and get a digi camera if you need to take good still pictures."
5,Everyone should read this book,This book tells you how to clean just about anything without harsh toxic chemicals so common today. Your body and environment will thank you for all the fresh air and your house will be green clean.
4,Great place to start!,"This only the second book on ""green clean"" that I have bought in the last few years. It will get you started on making your own safe cleaning products. I have to say that many do actually work better than their supermarket counterparts!"
3,"Good information, hard to read","The book was not an enjoyable read, but it was informative. The type is just too small or something. I can't quite figure out what I didn't like, but the columns are small, and there are two to a page, and the font is really tiny. Also, I questioned the material this book was printed on -- it didn't feel that ""green"". It might have been, but it did not seem like it was. Good information though."
2,Lid Design Flaw,"This spice rack is attractive in the kitchen but has very cheap jar lids. The lids do not seal they are stamped from very thin stainless sheet metal with no liner. The cap has a few notches to engage the jar threads but no female threading like a typical retail spice jar. So two stars for looking nice, three off for not sealing my spices away from the humidity and air. For the price this is very disappointing."
1,Simply Awful,"This has got to be THE most horrible read I've ever suffered through. Flat characters, those damned dolphins (""gotta check the dolphins"", ""gotta look in on the dolphins"", ""how are the dolphins"", ""I hope the dolphins are alive""), no surprises. Sheesh. The writing style is one where you expect a character to jump off every other page, look you in the eye and say, ""OK, you got that?"". Really, I devour books and find good qualities in most. This one was torture."
1,Doomed,Do not read this book. It causes your brain to try and eat its way out of your skull. It's so much like all her other books that I could tell what was going on. The entire plot was so transparent it might as well not be there at all.
2,Not one of her best,"Fatal Tide suffers from a simplistic story line, underdeveloped characters, and lack of depth. Unlike some of Johansen's other characters like Duncan, Quinn, and Kamal, the intrigue and likeability factor is missing. If you are looking for a satisfying read, skip this one and go to some of Johansen's other books."
1,Don't Waste Your Time!!,"I find it almost impossible to understand how Iris Johansen became a best selling author if all her books are this bad. I say ""almost"" because she does follow the formula for much popular fiction: Take fabulously rich, beautiful people + exotic/romantic locales + violence + sex = best seller. Sometimes the character and plots in these books are sufficient to make for a ""guilty pleasure"" summer read--but not this one! Beautiful Melis was rescued from a harem where she was sold to be a child prostitute. She now lives alone on a private island where she works with two rescued dolphins. When her benefactor appears to be blown up on his ship, she joins the ""good guy"" to fight the ""bad guy"", and along the way manages to find (on the first try) an underwater, lost city, with the help of the dolphins, of course. Characters are one demensional and the plot is anorectic-thin. Read trash if you must, but find better trash than this!"
5,Excellent,"This book was outstanding. I've read many books, and I'm just taken by all the books that Iris ahs written. This lady knows what women want to read and basically gives it to them in her books. I will be seeing more by this author."
2,Ehn,"As another person stated this is a romance novel disguised as a suspense thriller. For that kind of book it's ok, a quick read. I've read much worse of this type. At least I finished it. I just wished they would stop making books like this seem one thing when they are another. But I did really like Pete and Susie, the dolphins. Two stars for the actual two stars."
2,summary about dragged under is not a scene in the story??!,"There is no thrill in the story at all. The murderer is so stupid he falls into traps every time. First of all, his name is revealed at the beginning, which takes away all the fun, and then he is such a fool that everybody would believe he himself would get murdered easily instead. Then, the back summary is a disguise again. The passage about Melis's about to be pulled under( seems... only seems... so exciting) is nowhere to be found in the story. Is there nothing in the story capturing enough that the author has to make up a new passage to grab readers' attention?"
2,Only a few pages in...,"I'm just starting this book, and chose it because I knew it had recurring characters, something I always like. It's a little maddening, though. Melis Nemid, from what I can remember and have managed to find on the 'Net, was featured in a couple of other books.. Wind Dancer and at least one other.. (Nanci, I think Wind Dancer is the one you're thinking of, where she's rescued from a brothel by Kemal). I'm really hoping the back story becomes a little more clear, though from what I've read here, it doesn't seem likely that it will. It wouldn't be fair of me to form an opinion yet, as I've only just started it, but for anyone else who enjoys recurring characters.. this one will probably drive you nuts."
1,Yuck,"Iris is a good writer, this is not a good book. Predictable, overly sexed, and just general bad plot and writing."
1,I can't believe how many people liked this book.,"I wasn't impressed at all. Iris Johansen writes like William Shatner acts (think emoting all over the place!) The drama and histrionics get old fast, and this book in particular asks you to set aside your common sense way, way too much. The first point of that is being asked to believe that there's an adult woman named Melis Nemid who hasn't changed her name legally. The premise of the book is interesting, but the follow-through.. eh."
4,My first Johansen book...,"I have a lot of friends who love Iris Johansen's work, and they recommended her novels. I found the mystery to be exciting, but the characters kind of bland. It's a good beach read for a light mystery."
3,Fatal Tide,"This book invovles characters from a couple of earlier novels by Iris Johannsen, and I enjoyed it, as I have all her books so far, although this was not one of my favorites...contrived story line, poor character development, kind of light on the satisfaction scale...I recommend it only to keep in line with the characters in past and future books in her series."
1,Revolting,"Mutilating of women and animals, white slavery, gratuitous torture and murder, the heroine a woman trying to recover from horrendous sexual abuse, and a wooden hero make this book one you would really rather miss.In terms of entertainment I would give it minus stars if I could. The fact that the supposed hero gets sexually aroused as she tells him about her life in a child brothel in Istanbul is just revolting, and there is about as much heat and sensuality in this book as a guttering candle. This is the first book I ever read by this author, and It will most certainly be my last.These are not characters, they are cardboard cut outs. Even the dolpins are only moderately interesting, and her foster father is too stupid and terrible to be true. A real let down for intelligent readers who want more than simple minded fluff written in words of more than one syllable."
1,"Awful, simply awful.","If I could have given this effort zero stars I would have, but alas the program wouldn't let me. Imagine my excitement at finally having in my eager little hands another Iris Johansen novel. Imagine my disappointment when it was undoubtably the worst book ever written! The dialogue is completely composed of platitudes and cliches, the characters are one-dimensional, and the plot thin. I couldn't care enough about the herione to make her problems matter to me.I do love all her other books, and her writing is usually clean, characters complex, and dialogue natural. I can't imagine what went wrong here, other than it was an earlier attempt that she stashed away for a while, then dusted off and updated without ever really rereading closely. Unless you really enjoy poorly written books, I would not waste my money on this one, save it for her next attempt."
1,fish food,"I've read quite a bit of Johansen's work, and have generally enjoyed it up till now. This was AWFUL. The characters were flat, the dialogue was lame, the plot was silly. I'm not sure why I bothered to finish it, except that I'd been looking so forward to reading it, and I kept hoping it would get better."
3,Fatal Tide,"This book isn't as bad as some reviewers have said. It isn't excepetional, but it isn't bad either. If anything, wait for it to come out on paperback, don't spend the money on hardcover. The only problem I had with this book was that it was too similar to Iris Johanson's ""No One To Trust"". The abuse situations were almost identical. A few times I had to stop and actually think about which book I was reading because I was starting to get the plots mixed up because they were just too similar. If you haven't read ""No One To Trust"", then it is a good book to sit down and relax with."
4,Outdoor Buddy,Perfect companion for the outdoor. I usually run it through dynamo which lasts for about 20 mins for every 5 mins spins. Reception is great for a Sony product compared to my old brandless radio. Would like to see a smaller version that chargers USB devices.
5,Great reference for graphic designers,"I am a graphic designer. I don't use this book every day, but I have used it on several occasions when I'm stuck and need something to get me started. The color combinations are fresh and up-to-date; there are so many that I always find one I can use.My sister-in-law is also a graphic designer, and I gave her this book with confidence. The cover is vinyl, not paper, and the quality is very good, so I don't worry about it falling apart any time soon."
4,Fully packed color book!,"This book is awesome! Finished the whole volume in just one day and had a beautiful splash screen done within minutes! I recommend this to any one involved in graphic design. My only gripe is that the colors on palettes for each chapters were not labeled with the corresponding CMYK and RGB values to allow the reader to pick colors while of course applying the color theories discussed, e.g., analogous, split complementary, triad, etc. I had to compare the colors of the palettes from the color swatches to get the color values. I could have rated this book five (5) stars if only the colors from the palettes were labeled."
5,Scrappers & Knitters Take Note,"I love the ""Color Index"" by Jim Krause. It is a wonderful resource for those times when you feel you've used up all your ideas about color combinations. Originally written for graphic artists, it can certainly be used by crafters. I especially like the chapter headings (Quiet colors, Active colors, Rich colors)and use the schematics to match my papers and yarns, and to find other combos I wouldn't have dreamed of using. Highly recommended."
3,Not for everyone,"I am not a designer. It was only after I bought this that I realized I was really looking for inspiration (for clothing and interior). The color index contains a lot of color combinations, but presented in a way that did not work for me. Somehow all the color combinations look boring, perhaps because there are many similar color combinations packed together on small pages, with tiny images. For my purposes, ""A Book of Colors"" by Shigenobu Kobayashi was better. It contains less color combinations and no rgb values, but there are less very similar combinations on a single page, and the images are slightly bigger. The result is more inspiring to me. So the color index is not for everyone."
5,Thank goodness for books like this!,"I love the resource this book provides in the creative and graphic aspect of my work. Designers of all media should have this book handy. I don't let it go too far,CAUTION: YOUR FRIENDS WILL STEAL THIS BOOK.Review every book you read- authors deserve your opinions, not just elitist critics."
2,Sentimental and Prosaic,"There are a couple of very good poems. One called ""Speaking the Names,"" and another, ""Kansas,"" are very beautifully done.That being said, the poems in this book are, for the most part, nice and nothing more. The language strikes me as particularly loose and unfocused, and the poetic voice is unwavering in its conversational vagueness. The longer poems do nothing to justify their length, merely making the same moves again and again.For the most part, many of these works are so languid and prosy that I am forced to wonder why they are called poems at all. Sentiment broken into stanzas and lines isn't what it takes to make poetry, but it's basically all Fairchild is interested in giving us."
4,Confortable and Durable,"I purchased these after trying on my son's speedo flip-flops. His were incredibly comfortable but, unfortunately, didn't come in my size. These are ALMOST as comfortable. Great to wear to the beach or to work in the yard."
3,Good History Book,"I liked it, but it was a bit repetitive (each season was documented in the same style which made them blur into each other at times).It read much more like historical documentation than a novel. The 20% or so that did read like a novel - I really enjoyed.The author's point of view was a little defensive - especially when it came to Ross Perot. She definetely didn't hide what side she was on, though. Nothing was said negative about the team or city. But, its not like Friday Night Lights didn't make you wonder about objectivity - so I enjoyed both - they were just really different.Finally, this one stops in the mid 80s - not long before Friday Night Lights picks up."
4,my home town,"This book takes place in my home town - Madison, Indiana - where Jenny Lind did famously visit and perform. It's on the Ohio River, not the Mississippi. Book is a great read!"
4,Worth it!,"our son is 2 yrs. old and we wanted to transition him from his high chair to a ""real chair,"" but boosters were not for him. we looked extensively at kids' tables and chairs and this one was perfect b/c it wasn't too ""kiddie"" and the price was right. the quality is very nice (almost nicer than our adult kitchen table!) and the set was easy to put together. the wood color is very nice too. he loves it and actually stays in his chair while eating like a big boy and will sit to color, paint, etc."
4,Pleased with product,"The item was delivered promptly. Fairly easy to put together. The dark pine stain goes well with adult furniture if you choose not to keep it in a child's room. It would have been helpful to have the measurements of the table and chairs. My daughter is two, and she enjoys the set. She can get on and off the chairs by herself. The legs of the chairs will slip if they are set on a tile floor. I plan to put rubber grippers on the bottom of the legs. I gave it four stars because I wish I had the option to purchase an additional set of chairs. I looked everywhere on the web site and I couldn't find that option."
3,Very Light,I knew I would be sending this table back as soon as I opened the box and saw how light it was. Much more a honey color than dark pine. If you are expecting something dark like chocolate brown then this is NOT the set for you - it is way way lighter than the picture.
3,Get the Boxed Set for much less....,"This story was made available a few years ago in a 3-disc boxed set called Doctor Who - The Beginning (Doctor Who - The Beginning Collection), which should still be available today. The fact that some third party seller has split the set and is trying to charge 30 times as much for the first disc is laughable. And idiotic. Besides,the best extras for this first Doctor Who adventure are on the THIRD disc:a lengthy documentary about the origin of the series, plus featurettes on the creation of the theme music, sound effects, and TARDIS interior design.Don't be suckered by exorbitant prices for this single disc. The boxed set contains the first three Doctor Who adventures, plus an abridged recreation of the fourth, and is a huge bargain by comparison."
4,Ghosts of Fear Street,"This story is about Mike who loves hanging out in his father's weird little museum on Fear Street. It is full of cool stuff-a guillotine, a mummy, a bunch of spooky wax figuress"
5,Must read!,When I got this book I didn't think it would be much. When I started reading it I couldn't put it down. I always wanted to find out what was next to happen. This book has a cool plot to it. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes mystery stories.
4,This is NOT a music CD but a play,"This CD is a Gravitation story in Japanese, using vocal actors from the Gravitation TV anime series.If you know the characters and recognize the voices you can find humour in the inflections of the voices even if you do not understand what is being said. The sound effects add to the atmosphere.Excellent for the Japanese student.Please note: this is a shounen-ai story line, meaning two males in a relationship. If you are offended by this idea don't purchase this CD.Or maybe you should and get over yourself."
2,"Not All The Numbers, But Paint By Numbers","I read so many recommendations about this book. Instead of living up to the hype, it is a big disappointment. While there are moments where you feel the grief, mostly you just follow the main character through a course you can see will lead to a certain conclusion, with a flat feeling about the whole thing. I finished it, but there was no emotional involvement by this point. The author completely failed to make me care about the characters by the end, with the possible exception of the surviving brother. I'm frankly surprised by all the glowing reviews of this book."
4,Fun Series!,Our special needs daughter is a big fan of Power Ranger movies so it was a nice surprise to find one that she didn't have in her collection. It arrived just as described and on time. Thank you.
5,Cool DVD,This has 4 episodes plus a bonus episode of a different theme. My son loves it and wants to watch it over and over.
5,So pretty in the garden!,"Great addition to my front door garden. Used it to prop up unruly roses and it looks wonderful. Goes together in a snap, presses easily into the dirt for stability. Great buy!"
4,"H1N1 Paranoia find: Affordable, unrated, but looks as good as 3M","I think it was the CDC that recommends the 3M masks because they were tested, but these appear to be quite similar and have a lower unit cost than 3M's. Buy respirators not just masks.[...]knowlengr | starwhisperer"
2,m.doc's material,"m.doc,You are a writer in your soul. I wish you would write from your soul! You'd be surprised just how beautiful you really are!"
5,Great fiction about real-life adventures of cold war warrior,"I, too, was a liaison officer of the USMLM from 1986-90. This book captures the excitement of the chases and intricacies of moving across East Germany while it was occupied by Soviet Forces. It may exagerate somethings, but I lived the experiences again when I read Recovery."
3,"Good, But For The Price, Should Be Better","Well, Amazon no longer carries the flat iron that I loved. So, I decided to move on to a different brand. I assumed that after paying 100 dollars for a flat iron, that it should be awesome. Although this does seem like a good flat iron, meaning it does what it should, I am disappointed in two things:1) The iron gets very hot and has no temperature selector. My 40 dollar one had this, why not on a 100 dollar one!?2) It seems to be built a bit flimsy.But, on the flip side:1) It heats up SUPER fast. My other one I would plug in while I blow dried my hair and it was hot by the time I was finished. This one, however, is ready to go only about 45 seconds after plugging it in.2) It's pretty."
3,Not as great as I expected,"There was absolutly nothing wrong with this product, but I just wasn't too impressed. I do like the product, but I don't know if it was worth the money. I had heard so many great reviews about the CHI, but I don't really see that much of a difference in my hair. My hair is pretty thick, so I was hoping it would reduce the amount of time needed to stlye it, but like I said, its not much better than the $50 ones you can get anywhere."
2,Not a reliable straightener,"I purchased this for my daughter who has thick hair. She has used many straighteners and I wanted to buy her a ""nice"" one. She had it for approximately 2 weeks when the on/off switch just fell off, actually it fell inside the iron. So she could not turn the iron on. Fortunately, it broke within 90 days of purchasing it on Amazon, so I had no problem with getting my money back."
1,died on second use,"My roommate used this the day after I got it in the mail. I was the second person to use it and it no longer worked. The light wouldn't come on, the plates wouldn't heat up, etc. Thankfully, Amazon had no problem with me returning it. If yours functions, it seems like a good value with the free hair products you get with it."
5,CHI rocks!,"CHI is the best hair straightener out there! If your trying to find a good straightener, you don't have to look anymore. It works so well and keeps your hair straight so that you don't have to straighten it again later in the day. I love it even more because it's pink. I was a little hesitant about buying a 100$ and up hair device but it really proved its worth. Before I bought it, I looked through a ton of reviews. If your going to buy this item, you should know that the button will melt if you leave it on for a long period of time. Take good care of this product and it will be well worth your dough. =]"
1,Dud Chi Straightener,"Did not work on my hair type, did not straighten my hair, left it looking dry and frizzy, I wasted my money."
2,one year and one month . . . item is now garbage,"I recieved this item last year for my birthday (November, 2007). I don't use it every day, but I do use it a lot. Just this month (December, 2008) I was heating up the iron. I went back to check on it after about three minutes, and the plates were completely melting off the iron. I liked this iron a lot and got much good use out of it (which is why I still gave it 2 stars). My only original complaint was the lack of temperature control. But it's unacceptable to have the plates melt right off, especially one month after the warranty expires."
4,Jill Illinois,A bit bigger than I expected - difficult to accommodate on flight!Good quality though and great for family beach stuff!
2,Not Robert Alexander's best work of fiction.,"I read Robert Alexander's novel The Kitchen Boy and loved this historical work of fiction about the Romanov family, so I was excited about reading Rasputin's Daughter as I've always been interested in Rasputin as well as the Romanov family.The beginning and ending of Rasputin's Daughter were the most interesting parts of this novel. The rest of the novel was long, boring, drawn out and seemed to go nowhere leaving me frustrated with the story and the characters. I was glad this novel was over and down with by the time the ending came around."
3,OK,"Maybe I want too much from fiction. I want it all to be literature, so I'm often set up for disappointment.The author gives a good description of how Rasputin might have lived in St. Petersburg (Petrograd) and Siberia, and and how he might have healed his petitioners, but fails to describe the protagonist. The title hints that we will get to know her, but we don't.The compressed time frame of the action interferes with our knowing her; so does the first person narrative. Maria spends a lot of time afraid while searching and being chased in dark places. We don't feel her terror, because we know she will survive and her father will die.She quickly snaps out of horror and anger at her father's strange healing methods. She falls in love with Sasha who seems to stalk her. She bravely searches the city alone for her father to answer the Empress's call for help. She dines at the palace. The author tells us what she does, but gives us no sense of who she really is or why we should care about her."
2,Rasputin's Daughter,"Interesting reading knowing fact and fiction are interwoven. But at times slow, boring and simply unbelievable. Will I recommend this book to a friend as a great read, no. Now Alexander's ""Kitchen Boy"" was wonderful by all comparsions and I did recommend this book to many of my friends."
2,2.5 Stars for this Alexander Work,"Robert Alexander's second novel ""Rasputin's Daughter"" focuses on the last week of the life of the Russian mystic Rasputin. Told from the viewpoint of Rasputin's eldest daughter Maria, the mystery and intrigue surrounding the last royal family of Russia and the mystic who had inflamed the country is recounted by a loving daughter who has questions of her own.Robert Alexander's first novel, ""The Kitchen Boy,"" was much better than ""Rasputin's Daughter."" This novel was good, but not as captivating as ""The Kitchen Boy."" I am tremendously interested in the last Tsar of Russia and the events of the Russian Revolution, so I was looking forward to this novel. I did enjoy it, but the novel was a let down. The plot was slow, the characters were well-developed but not particularly likeable. I would recommend this book, but only as a library loan."
3,The End Of Rasputin Through The Eyes Of His Daughter,"Robert Alexander bulwarks the historical events surrounding the last days of Rasputin through an account of the time through the eyes of his daughter Maria. While I enjoyed the Kitchen Boy by Alexander, I found this effort a little less favorably, though its a little difficult for me to say why.Rasputin is certainly one of the most fascinating characters in the last days of the Tsars -- I've alwyas found Nicholas a little wooden -- and perhaps I expected more of a ""view"" of Rasputin in here. Instead what is put forth is a disjointed portrait -- though that likely is the portriat that any child would have of a flawed parent.Regardless that I didn't ""get"" this book at its core, it did provide a compelling picture of Russia just as everything was about to fly apart."
3,"Interesting and imaginative story, simplistic writing","This book brings to life the enigmatic Rasputin in a vivid series of vignettes through the eyes of his eldest daughter. It also depicts the last months of the Tsar regime in an easy to read, fictionalized context. This book, and Robert Alexander's other recent novel The Kitchen Boy, both disappoint on a quality of writing level. Simplistic, this is definitely not litterature: ""Shocked, I gasped..."" ""i'm going back out, I said, crazy with fear..."" I would have liked less drama, more historical facts and less ""romance novel"" style, simply better writing."
3,British Siberians??,"The reading was indeed spirited and well done. However, Russian characters would sound better with Russian accents. I was especially turned off by hearing Father Grigori himself, in order to sound like a peasant, I presume, read in a Cockney accent!! That was almost enough to make me give up listening to and, instead, read the book. Surely a narrator could have been found who could do a Russian accent.What I found most illuminating about the book, though, was the idea that the legend about Rasputin's near immortality and the inablility of the murderers to actually kill him was actually fabricated. Being of Russian ancestry, I always took some pride in the idea that this Russian was nearly indestructible, a strong bull of a man. I should have known it was political spin. But it was refreshing to hear a new side of the story, and I am spurred on to read other source literature, as well as The Kitchen Boy."
4,Book drew me in,"I didn't know prior to reading this book that Rasputin had several children, including Maria, the supposed narrator of this story. The endnotes to the book state that in reality she eventually left Russia, led a very colorful life, and died in the United States.This was all very interesting to me in that I had always thought of Rasputin as a completely evil historical figure. The story as written by Robert Alexander comes off as plausible, although the romantic storyline seems stilted.I disagree with the other reviewer who thought the inevitable death of Rasputin left no drama to the story. The drama is in the nuance to Rasputin as both good and evil, leading to wondering if his murderers are likewise both good and evil. There is the clash of: traditional Russian religion and mysticism versus a desire to save the monarchy/aristocracy and ""modern"" Russia.Maria's character could have been more developed, but I still liked her very much."
2,A slow read to nowhere,"At first, the book held my interest. However, as I plodded along, it became over melodramatic and quite unrealistic. I grew tired of Maria's constant dodging in and out of alley's, buildings, palaces, dark streets, dark basements..on and on and on.While the story began well, it truly spun (like Rasputin) out of control and became quite unbelievable."
3,not necessarily about the revolution.....,"I enjoyed this novel whose backdrop was the Russian revolution, but I don't think the revolution is the main story here. In fact, if you want info on the revolution, as other reviewers have stated, you will be sorely disappointed. The book is short on detail, and long on the general mood of the times. Alexander does do a great job setting the atmosphere in a very dramatic (yes eye-rolling way) but then again, that is the nature of the times as described by the main character, Rasputin's daughter. To me, this story is her story, Maria Rasputin, and how she came to know and understand both sides of her father--the corruption and the spirituality--in the days before his assassination. It is her ""growing up"" but with the special backdrop of the Russian revolution. I would recommend reading this book if you like fiction set in the days of St. Petersburg, and would enjoy seeing ""another side"" to a mythic character."
5,I Loved This Book!,"I can not begin to tell you much I enjoyed this book, Rasputin'sDaughter. Robert Alexander is a wonderful writer and is able to make the reader feel the very emotions of Russia during the time of the Romanovs and by sharing his love of Russia and it's rich history with us it draws us ever deeper into the story.As someone who has been interested in the history of the Romanovs and Rasputin for many years I was fascinated with the satisfying way Mr. Alexander book wove fiction with fact to form such an amazing and satisfying story."
1,Historical Fiction at its worst,When historical fiction is well done you can be transported to that time in history. This book can not be seriously considered historical fiction. Not only is it poorly written-it could have been written by a freshman high school student. It is melodramatic and short on the history of the times. The Russion Revolution is practically ignored. The charachters are similar to those found in the romance genre. The author writes endless questions to the reader since you are much too ignorant to imagine what has transpired. There are too many quality books to be read to waste time on this trite book.
3,Some Interesting History,"Since my days as a teenager, the story of the Romanovs has always fascinated me. (Did I mention that I brought Nicholas and Alexandra on my honeymoon?)The book offered a lot of interesting period detail, and after a slow start, the pace of the story/narrative picked up a bit.However, one thing really bothered me. I just didn't feel that the words of Rasputin's Daughter really sounded like the words that would be spoken by a woman--more like a man writing how he thought a woman would speak.Overall-just ok!"
2,Thoroughly disappointing,"I am a fan of history and historical novels, and I eagerly picked this one up. Unfortunately I could barely finish it.It was superficial and contrived. The book takes some very well known facts about Rasputin (drinking,womanizing and mesmerizing eyes) and contrives to create a story through the eyes of his daughter, who is simply a device to describe the last week before Rasputin's death. There is no dpeth to the characters, nor does the book transport you to St. Peterberg- which good historical fiction should do. I'll stick with re-reading Robert Massie."
2,"Forget the Book, See The Movie","Poorly written, histrionic Russian pulp. Oh, did I mention ""trite""? The writing consists of overused references to ""filthy"" and ""dirty"" and eye-rolling descriptions like: ""I cringed as her dank, steamy breath poured against my cold skin and spilled like old tea down my collar"". I cringed when I read that. Don't torture yourself, get your history from Wikopedia or, for more fun, rent ""Nicholas and Alexandra"". Not a great movie but it goes by faster, is more entertaining with better dialogue."
4,A Fun Software,"I bought this software for my granddaughter because I found that the software that is preinstalled with the ClickStart was too babyish for her. I carefully reviewed the softwares for this computer and I felt she would enjoy Learning Carnival. It is alot of fun and she prefers it to the installed software. The reason I rated it four stars is because it's not as challenging as I hoped it would be. However, she really does enjoy it and it's alot of fun. I would recommend it."
3,eh,"This disc has 2 mouse games and 1 arrow key game.It is probably a next level game. It seems ok, but either my child isn't ready for it, or it is boring.I personally think it is a bit boring compared to the others.If you are not planning on owning all of the clickstart games then I would skip this one. I feel like it is similar to other games on the system as far as learning letters and it is another mouse game. I would return this if I had bought it at a store but that's just because I can tell it will sit in the back of the tray and not get used that often compared to the other games."
2,What a waste,"3 games and none of them can hold my daughter's attention, she's 3 and some of the games seem pretty hard even on level 1 so she gets bored. Plus most of them are games that require a lot of mouse use, and Leap Frog didn't do the best on making a nice easy to use mouse for preschoolers. I wouldn't buy and wouldn't recommend again."
2,There are better downloads available. not reliable,The games on this are rather basic and not good value for money. Not much choice. I've found better free downloads on the web which my grand-daughter plays much longer.My device has locked up after not much use and I cannot use it.
2,Edited Sucks....,"i'm a huge fan of bloodhound gang and had boughten there hooray for boobies cd and then had listened to this and it sucks, almost every word is cut out...if your a b.h.g. fan just stick with the standard edition."
3,Not a easy read. Very boring.,Not recommended as best course book. I was very disappointed in the selection from the instructor. Let's hope that another book is selected going forward.
4,best light-control panties,"love these shaper panties...they do not ride up and are very comfortable. hard to get size 5 in black or rose colors. wash well without losing control. stock up, especially if you see size 5."
4,"Excelente book, has a lot of information that i haven't seen in and other book","Excelente book, has a lot of information that i haven't seen in and other book"
3,Educational for all ages,"I find the book interesting & educational.As an adult, I find it funny & interesting to discover that our underwears have evolved through time.As a mother, I find it a good material for our toddlers to develop their motor skills & discover the ""cause & effect"" concept. Warning though, be careful when allowing your toddlers to handle the pages. The flip-flaps are not that sturdy for tiny, curious & aggressive hands."
4,Good book,"I thought this was a really cute book - obviously well researched, and a really neat concept. This is a good book for anyone 6 years or older."
4,BRAvo,As something of a amateur underwear wearer I found 'I wonder whats under there ?' an inspirationol read.Y fronts have become inverted catapults of tradition and nether pleasure in my eyes.I did'nt know a gusset from a corset before this.Lifting the flaps of the book gave me a nether vista previously hidden to me by the conifers of my upbringing. Viva Thong
4,Mr Nasty is a nice read... very nice!,"While Cameron White may not be a nasty person as the title implies, he has definately seen his share of nasty situations and nasty people.With an easily accessible writing style, Cameron White takes the reader on a very frank, exciting and realistic foray into the world and lifespan of a student turned entreprenuar.The protagonist is a very likable guy, and anyone who has seen the periphery of society can relate to his experiences that at times can be linkened to walking on egg shells resting on razor blades.Using a series of locations as different as his experiences, from London to LA to Berlin to Thailand to Sydney, Cameron shows that we can outrun our problems but we can't outrun ourselves.Mr Nasty is an excellent read, especially for those who like to flirt with danger and can relate to the experience of buying drugs."
3,OPI NLF09,"I llove the color, how ever I had to use 3 coats and the polish didn't last long. I willn't purchase again."
5,A must read book.,"I bought this book for my son, Jefferson, who is 9 years old. When I looked through it, I started reading it, and just couldn't put it down. It is a wonderful book, of hardships like we have never known before, and survival of a wonderful religion and people. We are not Jewish, but I enjoyed this book immensely, and will be reading other books by this author. This book is great for adults, really makes one appreciate all that we have in this country; freedom first and foremost. For children, it is a great book to teach about hardships and compassion for others, as well as understanding history and the second world war. A DEFINITE 5 stars from me."
2,I Was expecting this one to be great because of the reviews,"This book only had 193 pages and almost half way through the book there was still no spark between the hero and heroine. The heroine did not even seem attracted to the hero yet and I can't tell for the life of me if he's handsome or not from the authors description of him. That might not be a problem for some, but for me it was agonizing. I have too many books that i'm looking forward to read, to waste my time on this one."
4,Good Book,"Yes, This is a fine companion to the other volumes in this series. M.C. Beaton always spins a good yarn."
5,Great gift,I gave this book to my friend on her 45th birthday. She can't stop talking about it and how much it has helped her.She says she just keeps reading it over and over again.
3,Some good points,"I found some great ideas in the book and some that I did not agree with. It did give me some things I will keep with me forever, but the overall inner child never resonated with me. My loss according to the book as this means I am still floundering."
5,Excellent Help,Most of us have been raised by parents who did not realize the damage they did to us in our formative years.This book allows us to see and repair that damage and therefore to treat ourselves as our parents should have treated us.I recommend this book highly.
3,Blinc - lash primer,"Perhaps I was expecting a small miracle - that my short, thin eyelashes would become long, thick, smooth and luxurious after using this along with mascara. That didn't happen. It add a little thickness, and maybe the conditioning is helpful. I will continue to use and see if there is improvement."
5,A stroll down memory lane,Book was filled with pictures of games I played as a kid. Lots of great pics and wonderful content. Price guide is not a reason to buy this book. But if you want to find a game from a long time ago this is it.
1,Almost entirely focused on pins and EM,"If you're interested in video arcade games from the 80s, this book will disappoint you. The content is VERY pinball-centric, with only passing mentions of arcade cabinets here and there.Not what I expected."
1,This book[ stinks]...,The market is a big determiner of what these games go for. The minute this book hit the stands it was out of date. Bill Kurtz fails to touch the pulse of collectors in this guide as it appears to be more ego gratification than a viable resource. And he considers himself in the business?...
1,Defective cd,"I received the ""The Kid From Brooklyn"" by Danny Kaye and it was defective. I sent it back and asked for an exchange-I still have not received a replacement. Hope this can be rectified soon.Alice Olla"
4,"Good but, could be better","The Human Odyssey:Life-Span Development is a form of psychology. The book is ok but, I wasn't too impressed by it."
4,Welcome to Los Angeles,"From the very first CD that I heard, to this newest, B.Down has come full circle! I would liken it to watching a child grow, each year it's something new and different. WELCOME to LOS ANGELES is fresh with beats,lyrics and rhymes that will have your ride bumpin! The ultimate house party CD...sure to have any party bouncin'. This CD has the national underground theme in CHROME DEEZ and the title song WELCOME to LOS ANGELES. Well worth it!"
5,Great Unit,"These units are great. Very accurate, tough and a good price. Let's you do your run and determine what route you want to do and keeps track of everything else. Also is fun to see your routes in Google Earth."
5,Love It!!,"I have spent a lot of money trying to find something I liked...my search is finally completed. I have had the Forerunner 205 now for about a month and it is exactly what I have been looking for. What kept me from buying before was the price. But now that the prices have gone down, I thought it was finally time to get it. It was great. I have not had any problems with the GPS. I've ran at several different locations from open roads to tree covered trails and it always finds my location. I used the Nike+ for about three years but realized during a half marathon how off it was in tracking my mileage. It was off by almost a 1/2 mile. I had to ask another runner who was wearing a Forerunner what the actual distance was. That's when I decided it was time to make a change. So far, I'm very pleased."
4,Great for training.,"The only problem I have is that sometimes it takes a REALLY long time to locate a satellite. Sometimes it never even finds one by the time I finish my 5 mile runs. That is really frusterating! When I go on long runs, I turn it on a few minutes before I leave the house and it usually finds one okay. But I do love the style and training aspects of it."
3,not as good as FR301,"I use 301 since years but I thought I'd upgrade it with FR205 since everybody praisedits ability to lock satellites fast so I took a plunge. Been running for a while with205 now and I can say it locks satellites faster, way faster then FR301 but that's about it.The screen is much smaller then FR301 making it harder to read when on trail running or duringrain with water going into your eyes you need bigger fonts on larger screen. Shape of the FR301is also much better for me then FR205, it's less bulky, less popping out of your wrist.Also it's easier to hide under the sleeve plus I like the flexible wrist bend better.Besides all that FR205 is too expensive for the features it delivers.I ended up returning 205 and still running with 301."
2,A reasonable product,"This product is useful, but I do find it difficult to get an initial connection to satalites. Also the product is not so easy to use, and the buttons are positioned awkwardly (start/stop button sometimes gets pressed by clothes during workout) leading to a loss of training info. It is also bulky and weighty and generally leads to me leaving it at home for the run, but being happy to take it on the bike. However, it does appear to provide accurate detailed speeds, distances etc once I was familiar with its operation and the software provided."
5,Great tool!,"Great, very helpfull for my running, keep me in control of my miles and easy to read while you are running, very water resistent, I wash all the sweating with soap and water, no counting on i was cough by the rain many times."
4,Garmin 205,"Over all produce is good. I bought it for my wife, she uses it for biking and running. I own a 201 and loved it, that's why I bought her a 205, size matters to her, 205 is a little smaller. It has a hard time picking up a satilite signal every now and then."
5,Forerunner 205,I really like this product. I really think it will help me this year to improve my times in 5k races.
1,didn't last long,"I received this as a Christmas gift, after adding it to my Wish List. It lasted about 3 months. Now it does not turn on, nor charge. Does not work at all. Up until now, I liked it, except it seemed to take a very long time to find satellites if I used it in a race or any place that was not close to my house. In any case, since it only lasted 3 months, for the price, I would not recommend it."
3,pavilion electronics is the worst website i have ever used!!!!!,"i purchased a garmin forerunner 205 for a very cheap price and now i really regret it. It was supposed to be shipped in three days. this is the eighth day! I called the website on the fifth day and was told that it was accidentally backordered. they told me this is a very rare thing and that they would cancel my order and i would get free overnight shipping from a manufacturer in california, this was a lie. i later received an email from them saying that it would be shipped in 3-5 days. i strongly recomend not to order anything from this website."
1,"Great at First, Until it Dies","When I first got this, it worked wonderfully. But maybe 8 months later, the software stopped recognizing the device, the sound stopped working, and eventually the battery quit charging. I wrote to Garmin and, after giving me a bit of a hard time, they eventually sent me a replacement since it was still under warranty. The new one was great. Until about 6 months later, when the software stopped recognizing the device again. A few months go by, and I came home tonight to find it completely dead. Won't charge, won't turn on. It worked yesterday. There is absolutely no explanation. My mother is also on her second replacement watch, as hers died before the warranty was up as well. I would NOT recommend this brand to anyone. GPS watches are great, but this one does not last."
5,great sports watch!,"can't complain, the basic setup is all I use now and I have not read the manual to get more familiar to all the features it has."
5,Garmin 205,"Relatively user friendly, all of the features are great. Sometimes takes longer than others to find satellites, but I just have to press the power button in plenty of time before I start my run."
4,Garmin Forerunner,"Works great except for a little slow getting the satellites on occasion. Love all the features. Have been running longer distances just because it's fun to take new routes, knowing you can track your mileage. Readouts are easy to see. Pace times tend to lag behind actual running speed but ""catch up"" when you review your average at the end. Seems especially bad in wooded areas even without leaves on the trees. Love it regardless as I know my running speed fairly well without the watch to tell me. Highly recommend it for any runner or walker."
2,"Maybe I am spoiled, but.....","20 years ago, if someone had told me that I could wear a watch that would communicate with satellites in space and give me an accurate distance for a run.....I would have been overjoyed.Today, however, I find the forerunner 205 to be a very frustrating product.Three issues:(1) There is no automatic ""off"" feature. So, if you don't remember to turn off the watch after each run, it's battery is dead the next day.(2) No light. Run in the dark....there's no way to read the watch.(3) Maybe the software was adequate in 2005....but in 2011...its very rudimentary."
1,Two years later...,"I am glad that I waited to review this item after two years - it died. After searching the internet, it seems as though many others have had a similar crash - some in a shorter period of time. I contacted Garmin and they would do a non-warranty replacement for $69.00. I won't take the risk. There have been too many problems with this unit. I asked Garmin if they would issue a credit towards a new unit - the answer was ""no."" Warning - do not buy this product."
1,Caution 205 and 305 will only last for 12 - 18 months!,"This is a great product, but it will only last you 12 - 18 months before the battery stops holding a charge and Garmin will not replace it as it is then out of warranty.This has been my experience and that of many of my running friends. The 205 and 305 are super when they work, but your battery will very likely stop holding a charge after 12 - 18 months and then you're sunk.Be aware you're very likely paying for 18 months of usage, and then will need to buy another one.This is a fundamental product flaw Garmin needs to fix! Their customer service folks are very nice, but won't replace the unit without a $70(ish) fee after the 12 month warranty period."
2,Disappointed,"It does a few more tasks than the 201, however:Wrist strap is not as comfortable or as easy to use.Internal battery does not last as long.It does not lock on satellites any faster.The readout is not as readable, particularly the details such as the last run statistics."
2,The 201 is better and cheaper,"I had been using the Garmin 201 model for over a year and was very anxious to get the 205. Since I got it, I find that the current pace is consistently wrong on the 205. The 201 is much more accurate when it comes to telling you the pace you are currently running at. The 201 does all the same basic things as 205 just as well and is much better on the current pace for some reason. The 201 is also about $100 cheaper and I would highly reccomend buying it, it is fantastic and a great value!"
3,Great GPS but software interface not very intuitive.,Great GPS. Software interface a bit difficult. A little bulky but then again I am a woman with a little arm. Would like if the battery indicator was on the main screen. It would help me to know when I need to charge it back up.
5,Great Product!,"I was an owner of the Garmin Forerunner 100 series. I liked the concept but found the GPS navigator would frequently lose the sat connection and then my training run would be ruined. Not so with this new model! This has a super sensitive receiver and works reliably in ALL conditions. It doesn't matter whether it is cloudly or you are among trees. It keeps connection all the time! I think it is a great improvement. There are other subtle features which are nice as well, but the reliability is worth it alone. It's a great product and Amazon sells it at a great price. Much less than what it was selling for at the runners expo. I am a happy customer all around!!"
3,not living up to its standard,I really thought that this was a good product. But upon receiving the 205 I saw a warning that states there is a chance that you could get cancer from wearing it! So that was a huge turn off for me. I mean who wants to wear something that gives them cancer. Its stupid! Besides that point the product is really good... but i think sticking with a old fashion stop watch isnt that bad of an idea especially since you can calculate ur distance using sites like http://www.favoriterun.com/home/welcome. And you're really getting the same result and saving a lot of money... It took me a while to realize that...but hey if u like to spend tons of money by all means go ahead.
4,Great,Buildings tree's and Powerlines reduce the accuracy but it still picks up an accurate GPS signal to run in areas.
3,Fit,"Overall I like this product, but the fit is not right. I liked velco strap early model. It is pain in the butt to remove your jacket because of it's thickest."
4,My 205 Garmin,I am very satisfied with this product. It is giving me what I need in my training. Th eonly negative is the battery life between charges is not as I expected.
4,Motivation!,"Forerunner is amazing... It really motivates me to run faster and farther- So far I've managed to improve my times almost every run.There's only 2 things I'd improve upon- It takes about a minute to finish ""Searching for Satellites"" in my area- no problem though, I just put it out on the porch while I tie up my running shoes. The other thing that gets on my nerves is inconsistancies in altitude. I've run the same route and the altitudes keep changing. I guess the satellites don't take their own elliptical orbits into account?I specifically chose NOT to get one with a heart rate monitor- between my music, my forerunner, and my cell phone, running out the door when I'm pressed for time (always!)takes longer and longer. The last thing I need is another bit of electronics to obsess over."
4,great running device,It's very easy to use. Does what I need it to do and more. So far I am very pleased
5,Forerunner is all it promises,"I'm not much of a ""techie"", but I was able with very little reading to set up my Garmin 205 in a matter of minutes and use it flawlessly. I run both on city streets and on trails and the Garmin performed perfectly. I'm finally able to guage how far I run on trails and at the same time get a pretty good read on how many calories I've burned! I recommend this to anyone who is looking for this same info."
4,Walking With the Garmin Forerunner 205,This device allows me to know how far I am walking and to change my pace at will. It would be great if I could have a map of my walk.
1,Dissatisfied,"I have had my Forerunner for 2 years and it has worked about 20% of the time. I sent it back after trying to get the tech support to help. They had me send it in and they said they sent a new one back as a replacement. I was in the second mile of the Louisville 1/2 marathon and it quit again. Since then I have tried to power it up and nothing. Charger shows it is powered, tryed the methods of unlocking provided in the handbook and still nothing. Bought a Nike+ last night for my iPod and it worked wonderfully this morning."
1,great start-bad finish,"i have bought several of these 205's, they worked great and i really hated to run without them but each one has died within a year of purchase. simply will not turn on, tried tech support at garmin but after an hour wait each time and then can't help you with that because you failed to register your product i thought i would give folks a heads up that the break after less than a year at least the three i have bought."
3,Unpredictable,"My running partner and I log 25 to 30 miles a week. She uses the 201; I use the 205. The 205 pace is often erratic, shifting back and forth within a four-minute range. Also, the measured distances aren't always consistent. By the end of a run, the difference between our Garmins can stretch up to a half-mile. This may not seem like a lot to some, but if you're trying to calculate your speed, it makes a difference."
3,"Read all the reviews to tell you it's features, but this product WILL NOT LAST!","I read ALL the reviews here on Amazon and many other places before I purchased this. I use it 7 days a week running and biking, and it performs admirably.There definitely has been an issue receiving satellite signal on cloudy days (takes up to 30 minutes!)But, my biggest issue with the 205 is that it doesn't last. I've had it for 21 months of regular usage, and one day after a run it just stopped working. It won't turn on, won't charge, my computer won't recognize it while plugged in--NOTHING. Just a blank screen--that's it.I called Garmin and they said it's a $69 fee to get it fixed (not including shipping). That includes a 90-day warranty. So, who knows, maybe after 3 months, I'd have to spend ANOTHER $69?Is $130 a good price for 21 months of usage? You tell me."
2,Good Tool - Poor Reception - Somewhat Poor Accuracy,"I have used the Forerunner for running for over a year while training for endurance races. It is easy to use and great for post run analysis using the free Garmin Training Center application. After your run you can look at your location, pace and elevation over time.Unfortunately, I have found the distance of the GPS to be off by about 5%. That does not sound like much but it has a significant effect on pace calculations.I have also had real trouble with reception. Many of my runs are on ""Rail Trails"" which are often cut into hills and overshadowed with trees. The Forerunner does not consistently work well on these trails.I also have reception problems when running in overcast weather and sometimes when running on trails under high voltage power lines.The Forerunner is a great tool when reception is good. Unfortunately reception has not lived up to my expectations so I am carrying it less and less."
5,great product.,"i have been using this mainly for trail running and mountain biking-- generally in VERY wooded areas. while it often takes quite a while to find a satellite signal, once it finds one, it is not too often dropped. i find that the speed on the bike lags a bit behind actual, but overall it seems quite accurate (i have nothing to compare it to). i LOVE this thing!!! it's so nice to have when trail riding when using books gives approximations and you know exactly how far you have left!!!! i'm addicted! can't wait to start using more of the trail/workout features!"
5,Garmin Forerunner 205 GPS Watch,"I love it! Great, accurate results. I love the upload capability to Motion-Based to monitor my training and even see my runs on satellite pictures. Absolutely awesome!"
5,Stepping up my training,"I'm a first-time GPS user and researched a lot of units before settling on the Forerunner 205. It's easy to use and accurately keeps what I need the most: time, pace and distance. I'm also a fairly new runner, and the software allows me to keep track of my workouts and enables me to see where I can improve and where I am improving. And the price was right."
5,Excellent Run Watch,I purchased this watch for my father and he likes the watch. I also have the same watch and love it. It is easy to use and does not require a lot of time to read the documentation to set up the watch for whatever activity you are doing if it's running or cycling.
5,great gps watch,"I love my Garmin 205!!! I had a Nike foot pod before which I liked but this is great. I love everything about it. I have small wrists, but it fits well and isn't too big. I can even set it to do 7min run/ 1 min walk intervals. I love downloading the infor and looking at it. It's very motivating! I would recommend it to anyone who runs."
4,Pretty good for the money,"This unit, while looking like something out of Star Trek, performs nicely. It reads consistant routes and distances, and acquires satellites rather quickly. The setup is a little much at first, but most of the settings are one time deals. The display itself and the display options are great for quick viewing. The only downsides I have noticed are the mapping features (it plots my running route out in the ocean) and the battery life (10 hours max, but I usually get around 7-8 before I have to charge). All in all, not a bad running partner."
5,Just what I wanted!,I had the first generation Garmin Forerunner 201 and decided to upgrade to the best thing. It's just what's advertised.
4,Much improved GPS watch!,"I had the Forerunner a few years back and decided to exchange it for a foot pod pacing watch b/c it took forever to find the satellites and i did not feel it was very accurate after i exited tunnels etc.I am pleased to say the product is *much* improved! It finds the satellites easily and the accuracy is tons better! I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking to for an accurate pacing watch. Or the 305 if you want your heart rate also.Be sure to download the software updates if they come out, that will also help the accuracy."
5,Great training aid,"I am a big guy, so the forerunner was not too big for my wrist or awkward. It is forgotten a 10th of a mile into your run. Being over 40, it can be hard to read but so is my watch! I have not used all the capabilities yet, but what I have used I like. I have another GPS, but I have to wear it on my upper arm which is very uncomfortable and awkward. The forerunner is great!!"
4,Great product,"I bought this for my dad who is an avid runner. I also run, so I borrowed this from him and I really liked it. It is very large, especially for a woman, but it didn't really get in the way of anything. I wore it during a 5K race and really felt motivated by being able to see my actual pace throughout the race. It really helped me to run faster because I could see when I was slowing down. I knew that I wanted to keep a minimum pace, so when I fell below the pace, I ran faster. You can also download all of your results into google earth, so you can see where you ran and you can track all of your running history. It really is an amazing product and I would recommend it for serious runners."
4,Forerunner 205,The watch does what was expected. It does sometimes take awhile to locate the GPS signal and sometimes loose's it in tree's or bridges.
5,High Performer @ Great Price,I bought the Garmin Forerunner 205 back in January 2008 for $150 w/ free shipping. I read a lot of reviews on multiple models by several manufacturers. I picked the Garmin for accuracy and holding satellites.It is a little large (physically) but when your running you don't notice it because it is light. There's endless options yet it is VERY simple to setup and use. The owner's manual is great and the 10-hour battery life (rechargeable) is extremely conservative. I've gotten the low battery warning right after starting a run and have had no issues running another two hours.I like how customizeable it is. The auto pause/resume feature is great when running in the city and the auto lap option keeps you on target (if that's what you want).The only time I lose satellites is indoors and under very large and low overpasses. Other than that it tracks continuously.Excellent piece and the street price makes it even better.
3,Three Stars,"The 205 does a great job as a multi sport computer, however I was disappointed to learn that the GSC 10 (cadence monitor), and the heart rate monitor won't work with it. if you want the extra tracking for your workouts buy the 305"
2,This thing is not worth the money!!!,I bought this for my wife as a gift in 2008. It worked great for the first year but as soon as the warranty period was over this thing started to act up. Does not turn on after charging several times. It comes on when it feels like it and then works fine for a few days and then the same thing again. Never been dropped or submeregd in water. It is a piece of crap.
4,Forerunner 205 GPS,What a great device! It is very accurate and easy to use. A perfect GPS for running. Very light weight and not so bulcky. I really like that you can switch miles/meter and 12h/24h. I just started running and never owned a device like this before. I'm very satisfied with it. I would recommend it to everyone.
4,I love my ForeRunner 205,"There's not much else to say. It works just as advertised and I have yet to have a problem with it. I have not used the virtual training partner function, as I have an actual training partner, but I like how I am able to accurately track my performance, and I like the freedom of not having to map out distances before a run.My only complaint, and the only thing that prevents my review from being a five-star review is the quality of the Training Center software that is packaged with the ForeRunner. It has limited functionality and is not very intuitive to use. Because of this, I don't use Training Center. Instead, I use a program called SportTracks to record and analyze my workouts.Overall, I love my ForeRunner, and I don't want to run without it."
2,Not what I expected,"I was so excited to use this watch since it was recommended by a runner friend of mine. But this watch seems having difficulty to locate satellites and it takes much longer time than expected getting connected. I wore it for my half-marathon race in NYC in January 2008, the pace was not accurately recorded, and after losing satellite signals in the middle of race, the data stopped being recorded. Now I stopped wearing this watch."
4,"Good, but....","Overall, I'm pleased with this GPS watch. It does everything I expected and I believe it is accurate. The idea of combining the GPS within the watch and not having to attach a separate device to my hip or shoe was especially appealing. I find the display easy to read and like the ability to manage what is displayed on the screens. The setup process was pretty intuitive. The only downside is that I find it takes up to 5 minutes to locate the satellites. May not seem like much, but when you are ready to go, this is an inconvenience. More so as I cannot operate the GPS indoors so there's no way to plan ahead and turn it on while getting dressed or what have you."
5,Garmin Forerunner 205 wrist GPS,"This is an excellent training partner. It keeps you on pace when running alone and is a must for anyone that runs in new places where you are unsure of the distances and don't ant to run for just time. I recently ran a 1/2 marathon and it was absolutely 100 % responsible for keeping me on pace, never going too fast or too slow. If you have ever run a marathon or 1/2, you know how seldom the mile markers are exactly where they are supposed to be.I am not a 'techie' so I haven't mastered all the things that it can do, but it is wondeful, with just the things I know how to do now. You can use it on your bike, hiking, running, roller blading and so on. It is a great toy, even for an old guy like me."
5,Garmin 205 get High-5,"I had the old Forerunner 201 and was not sure the new model would be worth the extra expense. I was wrong, it is a much better system. Not only smaller, but quicker response, less dropping signal in trees and more functional. The interval trainer lets me do run-walk with ease and keeps track of total time (in real time) which the FR201 does not. So, I am very happy that I upgraded. I have not used the training package that comes with it, but it is great for keeping track of progress on the go. I do not miss the HR feature in the FR305 so the FR205 is ideal for me. It switches from running to cycling much easier too, for you dual or tri-athletes."
4,Great little device,"I got this primarily for running. It's accurate, measuring the same course results in the same result. The display is large and clear, the map function on the device just measures the route (no terrain, landmarks, roads etc...) but that's enough for my purposes and expected on this form factor. Has all the measurements I required for running (pace, speed, time, calories), the ability to race against your old times is really good, great motivator. The nerd in me loves plotting my routes on Google maps and posting them to Facebook!It does seem to take a very long time to find satellites when initially turned on (sometimes a couple of minutes of standing around), and the battery life I only seem to get 4-6 hours. Those two points are all I can fault it on really, but for the price you can't beat it."
5,Great hiking buddy.,Really like this most for hiking. Easy to wear. Easy to read. Plenty of info for me. Tried it on my bike but shouldn't use it with the existing Cat Eye cyclometer.
2,Not pleased,Not fond of this running watch. I find it actually frustrating that it takes about .5 miles for the watch to find a satellite. I don't like the fact that one has to wear the watch at least 20 minutes before a sattelite is located. I am thinkin of returning it.
5,Garmin Forerunner 205,I am very satisfied with the unit. Finds satellites in about 35 seconds from same starting place. Accuracy is very good. Charging station works easily and same cable lets you downlaod information to your computer. Unit is rather large in size but no bother when wearing it.
3,It's ok,this is ok when it works. it's a good tool to have for running but i'm not satisfied with it because for some reason or another it just stopped working and wouldn't recharge or even turn on.
4,A necessity for runners,"After two weeks with my Garmin 205 GPS I wondered how I had managed all these years without one. Although at times it is somewhat slow to locate satellites once it is powered on (this depends quite a bit on your location), when it locks on the satellite it is extremely reliable and accurate. The autolap and bell function are great. It has so many features it is difficult to use them all. I have yet to take advantage of the virtual runner. It can store large amounts of data which can be easily downloaded to a computer. At first I was worried about how bulky it may feel, but after a brief bit of use, I don't notice it any more than the sports watch I used to wear while training."
4,love it!,"This is our first GPS watch for running. My husband and I both share it and it works great. I love that it is able to be charged and it works great! It has been very easy to use and does exactly what we want it to do, track our distance and pace."
3,Starting to fail after less than two years,"I purchased my Garmin Forerunner 205 in October 2010, less than two years ago.I have used it for over 3,300 miles and have been very happy with it's overall quality and reception.It works great road cycling/running, not so good on trails, especially in river valleys.It always seems to be more accurate than iPhones.I took a nasty spill mountain biking and ripped the wrist band off and have been using the extra provided since then.All that said, it is starting to fail now. It does always turn on and the battery dies after 56 miles, a little over 3 hours. It used to last over 100 miles, over 6 hours."
5,great item,"I got this for my daughter. She is a runner for Cross Country at her high school. She loves it! It works well! It takes a couple of minutes to find the signal, but that is usually when she is warming up, so 2 minutes is no big deal. Thanks Amazon!!!"
4,Garmin 205,These are issued to us at my school. They are very easy use and quite reliable. I recommend them for anyone wanting to improve their running.
4,running watch,"The features on this watch are really cool. The only down sides are the size of the watch and the fact that you can't actually see what time of day it is. Other than that, the watch is accurate in tracking your run. Some of my favorite attributes are that you can download your run on the computer and see exactly where you've been, and how fast you were going every step of the way. It keeps account of elevation as well. Overall, I would recommend this product."
4,"Good, But 305 is Better","I purchased the Garmin 205 when I was browsing Amazon and saw this for a greatly reduced price. I had my son, an avid bicyclist and hiker review but he felt the Polar CS200cad Cycling Computer was better. I purchased anyway and then began reviewing the 305. I liked the idea of the heart monitor and the extra features on the 305. The price wasn't that much greater so I returned this and bought the Garmin 305."
4,Love this watch!,"I bought this for my husband recently who has started running competitively. He absolutely loves this watch. It came highly recommended by another friend who runs about 100 miles per month. It has really helped him identify his distance, pace, etc... I would highly recommend it to those really interested in training for a marathon."
5,Technology Delight,GPS-the next breakthrough in running gadgets. Many thoughtful and helpful features designed in by Garmin...light years ahead of typical stand alone HR monitors on the market today.
2,"Better than the 201, but not much","This unit picks up satellites better than the 201, but it still drops them. It backtracks the lost mileage, but with a plus or minus factor of 50 feet or more, your mileage may vary -- mine did and that's why I sent it back for a refund. GPS may work for cars, but for personal tracking devices, the distance variation makes it too unreliable for an active training program. I'm going to try the accelerator watch from Silva to see if it gets it any better than Garman does."
1,Poorly built - but great when it works,"I had the 205 for 6 months, and it seemed to work fine, I ran a marathon and the 205 clocked it at 26.3 miles (pretty darn close). Lately, it won't hold a charge, and powers off unless it's connected to the charger. I haven't received any satisfaction from Garmin, and I am returning the item to Amazon. I hope Garmin can work this issue out, because when the 205 works, It's really a great tool for the avid runner."
3,fun to use,"I was wondering if anyone has tried this for accuracy. I haven't been able to run much lately so I tried my 205 on a track. Either it doesn't work on a track or it seems to be 15-20% off. I don't think that is very good. I do however run on the very outside of the track. Oh, at some point it said I was running 8.5 miles/hr. Never in my life have I run that fast. I feel disappointed."
2,Bad Batteries,"I was delighted at how easy this watch was to setup, and anxious to use it. I read instructions and followed setup instructions and watched it Load Satellites very quickly. I set it out to use the next day, but when I picked it up to use the next morning, I received a Low Battery message and it promptly died. I now have to get a battery replacement and am frustrated that I wasn't able to even use the watch until I replace the battery. After I get new batteries, I will know more about how the watch functions... Seems pretty poor quality that batteries don't work 1 day after you purchase the item!"
4,I was frustrated until I learned the trick...,"I have used this product since April and have been very satisfied overall. I really like the way it synchs data with my Mac.The menus take a while to figure out. It's like cell phone software in that it takes a number of clicks to get to exactly what you want.I live in Hawai'i and I was getting irritated walking around in circles staring at my wrist while the unit tried to locate satellites. Then I read a great tip on-line. Just turn the unit on and put it down; go back inside and put on your shoes. When you come back out, it's ready to go."
4,Garmin gps watch,Watch is good. Very accurate. The software on the computer is crappy as it doesn't import all info nor does it allow you to show graphs of certain things. But once you customize your settings on the watch it works great!
4,Walkers path management,"GPS was purchased as a gift for a trail walker and hiker. GPS is started to record at begining of walk and is shut off at the end. The data is then uploaded into the provided software and then plotted with Google Earth automatically. The trails and pathways can be reviewed, pace determined, way points set and seen. Great fun to review the walk later and if desired over again. Data can be saved and records maintained if desired. The GPS is being used by a techno phobe! without issue. Great Product."
4,Must have for training,"Great product. Use it all the time for training and racing pace control. Didn't get the 305 with heart monitor bc I thought I would never use it, now I wish I had gotten that option so I could do HR training."
5,Fantastic training aid!,What the wife sez: This is easy to use on short and long runs. Accurately tracks my pace and distance and is loud enough for me to hear the interval beeps over my headphones. It's great and a fantastic training aid!
4,Garmin 205,"Great item for sports, but had to return because sweat got inside the watch. Otherwise great item."
4,Great gadget for a gadget freak,I originally purchased the garmin to motivate my work outs. Wow was I impressed. I love the features and find it really easy to use. My husband now wants one.
2,Don't quit your low tech version 50 for this clunker!,"Although I really enjoyed my Forerunner 50, I really wanted a GPS-enabled device that would plot my runs on a map. Well, the map plotting feature stinks--it looks like you have to go through several extra steps just to see your route on a meaningful map, possibly paying for another service. But more importantly, I've twice had the device not charge after being on the charger. I'm not sure what the problem is--maybe it has to be in the ""off"" position? But the worst is the instant pace. With the prior, non-GPS version, the pacing was very accurate and with almost no lag. With this one, my recorded pace can vary from 7-12 minute miles despite no apparent change in my actual speed. They need to build in some sort of a smoothing algorithm. I regret having gone through the upgrade and wish I still had my low-tech version. :("
5,Awesome device for marathon runners,This is a great device. I was shocked by how well it works and all it can do. I no longer have to run on pre-planned routes to keep track of my mileage. I don't have to worry about pace or distance in races that don't have mile markers. All this information is on the watchface and can be uploaded to my computer and permanently stored at the touch of a button. It also keeps track of calories burned and shows your routes in gps format on the computer. It is extremely user-friendly. The only drawback is the size. I have a small wrist and it is kind of heavy. Definitely worth its weight though. I'm sure Garmin is working on this aspect for future models. If there is a distance runner on your X-mas list--this is the ultimate gift.
4,Experiences with the Forerunner,"The Good: Easy to set up. ProvidesGARMIN 010-00466-00 Forerunner 205 GPS Receivergood detailed information on your run. Easy to strap on and holds its place no matter how difficult the terrain.The Bad: Nothing of note, except at times depending on your location there is a bit of slowness picking up satellite. I usually turn it on on warm up so it can find signal, once I am ready it is always ready to go.A great addition for casual runners like myself."
3,great features but GPS reception is not optimal,"I got this product for my wife who likes to run triathlons. The device is great in measuring your speed, distance travelled, etc. It is quite big, especially for a female wrist, but when doing sports beauty is not a priority anyway. It does not pick up GPS signals inside our apartment, and outside only when walking into a somewhat open area free of surrounding buildings or trees. But once you get a good position tracking, it works pretty reliably."
4,Great product for a great price,This Garmin has provided hours of enjoyment for my boyfriend. He is an avid jogger and loves the functions this device has to offer. The price was better on Amazon than in my local store. The processing and shipping was prompt.
1,"List price is $267.84, not $300+",From the Garmin website:Garmin part number: 010-00466-00Suggested Retail Price:$267.84 U.S.D. (for domestic US market only)
4,great ! Lots of fun.,This works well but sometimes has a problem if you enter and very forested area. Otherwise I am using it to help me train for a marathon. It is a very good motivator and I love the computer download.
5,Garmin Forerunner 205,This arrived quickly and worked perfectly. It was given as a gift to my son and he couldn't haven't been more pleased. He has since lost the Garmin and has purchased another 205 to replace it.
3,This was a gift,I never used it. It was too large and bulky for me. I needed a smaller version and my IPhone works well
3,Garmin Forerunner,"This gps runners watch worked well for a year then it just quit. After troubleshooting it every way we could, we just decided that it would be easier to get another gps watch. We were disappointed that it only lasted a year, especially for the price. There is no way to replace the battery; it is factory sealed and talking/emailing with Garmin got no results. I would think twice about buying another Garmin watch."
3,So so,It is all right but not what I had hoped for. The fact that distances cannot be measured indoors is a disappointment.
5,Happy with Forerunner 205,"I am very pleased with the Forerunner 205 training device. I have just used it for 50+ miles over the last month and so far haven't had any major trouble. It takes anywhere from 30 secs - 1 min to locate the satellites. It lost signal momentarily on a couple occasions when I was running under shade but I guess any GPS device would probably do that. I haven't had a chance to play around a lot with the software except reviewing the running history. My only regret is that I should have bought the Forerunner 305 as I am now looking for a heart rate monitor. This is my first GPS device so I can't make comparisons to other devices available. Overall, I am satisfied."
4,A reliable device,"I'm not an experienced user of GPS devices, so I cannot compare it to the competitive products, however my opinion is that my Forerunner is doing what I expected. Before buying I have read several opinions about that it tends to loose the signal or to present the false data. None of those I have observed after 1 month of intensive use. I use it for running and for windsurfing and in both cases it works pretty well. I run in the forest and among buildings in the city but the signal is lost very occasionally and it is retrieved fast. The waterproof feature has been proven as well :-). The only issue I could have is that one of the 4 pins use to connect to the docking station is getting rust, so I have to clean it up every time I need it to connect to my PC. This is why I give 4 stars not 5Filip"
1,Forerunner 205 - issues with power,"I am on my second Forerunner 205 experiencing similar issues: It won't power up after recharging. I am working with Garmin tech support on the second unit. The first one I returned to Amazon after a month. The second one has now lasted just over a month before experiencing a problem. This is a great unit when it works, but I'm hesitant to give it good marks if this same issue happens twice and the usual troubleshooting recommendations do not work. The one star rating I feel is deserved when the same problem has happened in two units.Amazon was wonderful in facilitating the return of the first unit - I'm seeing what Garmin can do right now. Else, it's back to a map & a compass."
4,My New Garmin's Even Better,"I had a Garmin 104, but for some reason it quit working one day. I run marathons for a hobby and I like to see my pace as I'm training. The 205 has features that I'll probably never use, but what I really like about it is the way it acquires satellites (almost instantly if I'm outside.) Also the buttons are easier to use, being a bit bigger and also raised further. The only issue I've had was when I was running the Las Vegas Strip, as the watch lost it's bearings for a time. It recovered nicely once the race passed into normal streets, though, and over all I'm quite happy with this purchase."
2,Battery issues at 2 months old,"I got this for my birthday mid-March 2008. It's now mid-May. The Forerunner has ceased powering on if it is off the charger. All indications seem that it is working normal so I can only assume this is a battery issue. I updated the firmware as Garmin suggested and tried the manual reset per the Garmin website... it still doesn't power on without being connected to the computer/charger. I'm in the process of sending it back to Garmin for replacement. This is very disappointing because I was making great strides with my running due to it's very detailed running display. A real letdown. Other reviews indicate the same malfunction and when replaced, the replacement unit malfunctioned soon as well. Bummed!Update 12/08/2008. Sent the unit in under warranty and received a new one. No malfunctions since then!!! Would change the star rating but it won't let me."
3,Needles fine but cables twist,I ordered metal needles because I like the way the yarn releases from them but the twisting cables about drove me nuts. I won't buy Susan Bates again.
2,Disappointing,"Despite the apparent promise of its size and title, this is a dated and not particularly balanced treatment of its subject. Too given to generalisation, it presents an idealised picture of Muslim Spain."
5,The Country Gentlemen did it again.,"If you like Country close harmony and/or Blue Grass, this album is for you. It is really well done."
3,I expected better from Mr. Paulsen.,"I'll start by saying that I think Gary Paulsen is one of our finest treasures as a writer for young people. Cody's story will probably appeal to boys - the story is adventurous and action-packed, but I was sorely disappointed. Mr. Paulsen has the incredible power to take a stand on big issues, and let his readers see that issue through the viewpoint of a single character - he did so on slavery in Nightjohn, on gun control in The Rifle, and on war in A Soldier's Heart. Those three books (and some of his others) absolutely stun the reader with the power of the written word. The Whitefox Chronicles doesn't even come close. This newest book is a nice little adventure story, but don't look for the awesome impact you have come to expect from this writer."
1,SB ranire,"The Chronicles of White FoxBy Gary PaulsenReviewed by Sachidnra BhagatIn the novel, The Chronicles of White Fox, by Gary Paulsen, we meet Cody Peirce, a teen age boy that is captured by the CCR and is trapped in one of their prison camps. This book is about a kid names Cody. He is also known as the White Fox. He got the nickname white fox because he is slick. He is a bold and brave person, who craves the need for escaping. He escapes and tries to come back to save his people. But the way back he gets whipped and hit by a bomb explosion. Also he meets an old friend named Franklin and his squad. The squad is called the G Company. After the explosion he is found lying on the ground, not moving. Will Cody wake up? Will he make it back in time to save his people? Or will they all die?There is no suspense at all. If you're looking a book with suspense this isn't the book for you. I don't like it. However, if you're looking for a thriller that is action packed this is the book for you."
5,soperman,"Something was up, he could feel it,and the tower gaurds were standing at full attention lookingfor anyone who dares to get out. White Fox Chronicles By Gary Paulsen is a fantastic book if you like action.A great part of the book is the main character Cody piece is so awesome. He is fourteen and has a very active personality. He also tries to risk his life just to be free. Cody is very unpredictable you don't know what's going to happenThe setting is also very exciting he is trapped in a prison camp because he got caught by the CCRThe plot is also very exciting Cody has to escape from the CCR's prison camp the plot will keep you guessing all throughout the book. This book has three parts to it Escape, Return, and Breakout. Those three parts are all so cool this book is action - packed.so if you are looking for a good Gary Paulsen book I would suggest this book"
5,EXCELLENT!,I think that this book was great - all three of them. It really shows kids fighting for their freedom and risking their lives for their friends.
1,Out of Context,"It is disappointing that most of Chambers' original works (as compiled by his wife) are not available on Kindle. These topical books from the ""Oswald Chambers Library"" string together a series of short quotes taken out of context form the original sources. Much of Chambers' work loses its impact and insight when this is done. I think this type of re-packaging cheapens the work and increases the opportunity for mis-interpreting what he actually said."
2,You get what you paid for!!!,"While the price is cheap, you really do get what you pay for!!! While this may be OK for Home use once in a while, that's all it's good for. For Comparison, a real 1/2"" Air Gun like a Snap-On MG725. 1,190 ft. lb. (1,613 N*m) of Bolt Break Away Torque! 810 ft. lb. (1,094 N*m) of Recommended Working Torque!!! Let me tell you, makes a HUGE difference. Not only that, but holds up for a very long time, until you have to get it rebuilt. The Snap-On is also lighter in weight!!! Then again the Snap-On is $400 or so. I've used a few Chicago Pneumatic tools in the past and they were JUNK!!! Snap-On tools are also MADE IN AMERICA!!!"
4,Handbook of Mixed Methods,"This handbook is a good source for researchers who have used simple mixed methods approaches in their research and want to go beyond this level. The variety of articles in the handbook will provide the reader with a deeper understanding of mixed methods, gives example in different research areas and also discusses issues such as publishing of mixed methods studies.Furthermore, the handbook will be a good source for students learning about mixed methods.I can only recommend to have this book on your book shelves."
5,Handbook of Mixed Methods,This is the core book for a post-graduate program on Designing Mixed Methods at McMaster University. The only other references we have for the course are a few examples of published studies. This book was easy to read (and most of the books in this area are not!). The chapters were ordered so that you could design your own research as you went through the book. The book is also written to be a handy refrence book for future research.
1,Not really Addler,"I bought the CD of the Best of Larry Addler and I was disappointed because I gave it as a gift to a very good friend who is a fan of Larry and to my surprise, he told me that the tracks don't play smoothly and it is definitely not LARRY ADDLER. Too bad!"
1,Why would I want a book full of pictures of Sedona when Im Going There?,"Dont buy this book, unless you dont mind reading the whole thing to get information. It is written in story form...it has no headers that so you can easily find information. This is supposed to be a guide book which should provide useful and easy to access information, instead it reads more like a novel."
3,A good movie,"This movie is okay. Nothing here is really Oscar-nomination-type-stuff, but most of it sufficies. The jokes are awfully tired though. The movie is worth a look."
1,"Could have been a good movie, but...","...but the handling was totally inadequate. This ham-handed, lame ""comedy"" spawned two sequels. May God have mercy on us all...wait a minute, I guess he didn't! Any movie that abuses the talents of The Beach Boys (who sing the mediocre title song) deserves a poor rating. Jack Warden is a wonderful actor; how he got into this mess is beyond me. Don't buy this on VHS or DVD or Super 8 or Umatic or any video or film format unless you want to groan continuously for an hour and a half."
1,I got physically ill.,"I literally got physically ill after watching this movie. It portrays a child doing as he wants with no desire or motivation for obedience. The directors do not take a neutral stance towards this lack of respect for parents and authority; they actually smile whimsically upon it and think it cute and beautiful. I know obedience and respect aren't high values in our society, but this movie takes the lack of values in Hollywood to new lows. A classic John Ritter movie."
3,We all know it is a dumb movie but don't take it seriously.,What is the problem with people who hate this movie so bad what is so horrible about this film? I laugh everytime I see this movie it is very fun to watch not boring but I admit the some of the story is rather stupid but you have to expect it with a movie like this. I have seen so many more stupiter movies than this. Of course all of you people can complain that if you like this movie you have some serious issues SHUT UP! John Ritter was good with kids in it and the other actors were alright but have a light heart while watching it don't take the film seriously just sit back and laugh at it it is a fun movie. And some other reviewer said that they got physically ill after watching this movie What the hell is that all about? I really cannot think of one thing that can be so bad in this movie that makes people hate Problem Child so bad it is a funny movie.
3,"Decent, but not for the family. So who's it for?","There's quite a bit of funny stuff in this movie, especially with regards to the crooked Mayoral candidate Big Ben, and the weasley Orphanage manager Mr. Peabody. Everyone on this movie is a criminal except for John Ritter's friendly dad character.This film has a lot of inappropriate stuff in it, so I don't think it's for kids. It's pretty childish though, so it doesn't seem to be for adults either. I don't know who it's for. I think it was a success in sales anyhow.Seriously, Junior should have been slapped upside the head. The kid was bad. Nobody should have had to tolerate his crud, even though everyone else in that little town was a crook too.Big Ben's the funniest character in the series. The man's a crook. Claiming to be All-American and selling out to the Japanese, and mooning everyone on TV. I guess he deserved to have his car window ruined by Junior. That was pretty funny actually.This is a rude and crude movie, but fun to reference."
3,quite good,I liked this film im 14 i first watched it when i was 10 i like stuff like that i woudnt recomend it for most adults but kids will probaly like it the boy is cute in an evil kind of way (a bit like chucky from childs play)overall quite funny! its worth watching at least once.
1,DUMB!,"I really did not like this movie at all. It portrays a 7-year-old kid who gets adapted by a nice family and the kid happens to be evil. Why is this movie rated PG? Shouldn't it be R at least. I remember when I first saw this movie in the theater along time ago with my mom and she thought it was horrible. This isn't a kids movie. I thought this movie was like The Good Son except in Problem Child right after when the kid gets adapted he's evil and in The Good Son the kid isn't evil he's a good guy. The character that plays Macaulay Culkin in The Good Son is evil. Well, anyways if you hadn't seen this movie do not rent it or buy it. It's the worst movie ever made. Even the second and third one is bad! The only thing that's funny in this movie is Michael Richars from Seinfeld being in it. The rest of it is stupid."
3,It's Too Short,"I liked the movie, I've seen it many times. But, there is always a problem, the movie ends too quickly. The movie is only an hour and, maybe, fifteen minutes? A movie should be one hour and thirty minutes/two hours. And the begining is too long. OK, so the boy goes from house to house because nobody wants him. I get the point. Does it really have to be five/ten minutes to tell us that the boy is a troublemaker? And what ever happened to the wife, Amy Yasbeck? For fifteen/twenty minutes, she's in a suitcase! I think you should see this movie but don't get your hopes up. It's not the best John Ritter movie. :("
5,Aren't Kids Simply Adorable.....,Definitely one of the best movies revolving around a kid(s) I've ever seen! Child-actor Michael Oliver did a terrific job of playing Junior Healy! Anyone know whatever happened to Oliver? The sequel was equally as hilarious! I recommend both!
5,too funny,"god lighten up folks. dont think you're destroying some kind of intellectual element of yourselves. this is so funny and is quite of the wall as it rejects a lot of the cheesy stereotypes of kids movies. i think people fail to realise this. touchdown, touchdown!!!!!"
4,"Not as good as the last 2, but cool...","I like the beginning the best, when they are first getting Junior, but all in all a pretty good, family flick. When my sisters and brothers discovered this movie, they watched it at least once a week. Only my brother was born yet when it was released, but I had seen it so I skipped but now I love watching it on TV. Again, though, the last two were much better. The ending to this was just..blah after awhile."
3,Ok Movie,"These movies R pretty good, though they arent exactly all that and a bag a chips, though you may want that while our watching this movie, but Its an okay one I guess."
1,Doesn't really cut it,"I bought this because it was suppose to peal an orange. It only partially peals an orange, which is of little use."
2,Doesn't Make Curly Fries,"The Rotato blades I was disappointed in because I purchased them thinking I could use them to make curly fries with but they are not adjustable for thickness as I thought they would be. For just peeling alone I would give them a 5 star but I myself wanted them to be adjustable in thickness so I could make the curly fries. I would recommend them with a 5 star rating if just peeling potatoes,etc. is all you want them for. They peel thin so you don't waste any of your product and seem to be very sharp in order to do a good job."
5,replacement head,I have a Rotato for about two years and use it all the time because of arthritis in my hands and I needed replacement heads for it. Love my Rotato.
3,rotato blades,The blades are fine but when I went to install them I found that I need a blade holder also. I called the supplier twice and was assured that a holder would be sent. I haven't seen it yet. The blades are useless without the holder. what can I do?
3,The apple ipeels,I tried to sharpen the original blades and found that this didn't work too well. The new blades work well and even better when you apply a little finger pressure when they are peeling.
3,Shipping Took Forever,"These blades fit my Daisy Stripper just fine, but I ended up purchasing a Rotato appliance from another company (that already comes with blades) because I was desperate to get blades soon, and this customer service was pretty much non-existent. They won't even email you back until 5 weeks has passed since you ordered. So. Five weeks after I ordered these blades, they finally showed up."
1,Unuseable,"These replacement blades are not as strong of a plastic where it snaps into the arm of the peeler and they popoff before the peeling is even half way done. I went back to using the original blade that came with the peeler.Even though it is dull and has been used for over a year, it still worked better than the new replacement blades.I have had this potato peeler for years now, it has been used for at least 3 Thanksgivings and I love it. I got alotof use out of the original blades but I'm not sure what to do when they are totally worn out. I'd hate to have tobuy a whole new peeler just to have new blades, the peeler itself is great."
1,Beware if not pleased.,I bought the potato peeler deluxe with a new set of blades. Peeler didn't work as stated. Sent it back. Got a partial refund. Sent the blades back unopened and never got a refund. Cost more to send it back than the blades themselves cost. Do not buy from either of these comnpanies as it is a ripoff. Amazon said they would give me a credit but never heard from them again. Will not buy from Amazon again. Thanks for listening.
5,I Love the Rotato,"This product is great the blades last for year. The original set lasted more than 6 years. My daughter really loves when I ask her to peel potatoes, it takes less than 1/2 the amount of time it normally does to peel large amounts. Great product"
5,at last theyve bought one dark night out on dvd,"Brilliant, ive waited so long for this dvd, i own two copies of it on tape and they are almost fit for the bin. i watched this movie when i was ten years old and its always been a favourite of mine. Classic horror with not a lot of gore but a genuine spooky atmosphere with a good build-up, especially when she is walking around the crypt at the start of the film. EXCELLENT!!"
3,ONE LONG BUT OVERALL EFFECTIVE NIGHT,"Meg Tilly stars as Julie, a wannabe-in-a-sorority teen whose initiation to spend the night in a mausoleum gets her and her companions in a whole lot of trouble. Surely, before you can even say oh-ho the dead'll be back in business, the living-dead do arise (much later, though), thanks to a recently deceased vampire-mind killer with a gift (don't ask). Despite all of its nonsense, ONE DARK NIGHT (AKA Rest in Peace, A Night in the Crypt, or Mausoleum) is a fun grade B movie that delivers, if only for its effective atmospheric build-up and its exciting dead-corpse galore conclusion. Tom McLoughlin's tight and well-executed direction makes up for a too stereotypical characterization and a too long-to-get-there horror action. But when the going gets tough, ONE DARK NIGHT is indeed a fun and chilling experience. It's just too bad McLoughlin's script couldn't have been more original.-----Martin Boucher"
4,ship date,"Has anyone ordered One Dark Night DVD from Amazon.com yet? And if so, did anyone receive their order yet? Amazon states that it will ship within 2 to 5 weeks. Is this so? Considering the street date was 12/27/05. I don't want 2 wait that long for my order. Contact : TonyQNguyen52174@aol.com"
2,Totally disappointing,"This is not a masterpiece. This is a rechewed remake of so many films on the subject : telekinesis, vampirism, living deads, and a night in a cemetery. A few changes are introduced here and there to give new shades of black to this kind of stale mixture which will not give you the visionary power of some Dune's melange. There are some moments when the springs of fear work and the grossness of many situations and scenes is by far enough to make you feel a little bit sick in the stomach. But if you like grossness and moderate gore, go ahead and practise nauseae at infinitum by playing the tape over and over again. Kids will like it as if it were a recollection of some summer camp night time ghost story around some camp fire in the depth of some forest.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"
3,Tilly Shines,A tired initiation theme livened up but one stella performance from Meg and some creative lemonade making from the crew. Quite frightening if you can get into it as much as our heroine. The extra disc is endless footage of filming without narration and interesting as that.
2,Ghastly,"All those stories are horrifiyngly ghastly, full of people who dies horribly and people who causes them to, and a m overall gloomy athmosphere. If you wat good fantasy, read Storm Constantine"
2,Gime me,"Big Audio Dinomite and / or Under World live Anytime . What's missing , well , it has no Soul 2 It . A waste of my precious ears and Time ... Later and have a Kool 2oo5"
4,Great 29 track Double CD from the King of R&B!,"First of all, R.Kelly is my favorite male artist of all time. Second,in this Awesome Double Album he shows more than ever his way to sing: R&B, Slow Jams, Ballads, Hip-Hop, Jazz, and ether Flamenco; Speaking English,French, and a little Spanish. There are pleny of great music here. My favorites are: Home Alone, If Im with you, Half on a Baby, When a Woman Fed Up, Get Up on aRoom, One Man, We Ride(With Camron,Noreaga,Vegas Cats and Jay-Z),Dont Put Me Out, Etcetera,Turn Back the Hands of Time,V.I.P.,Did You Ever Think, Reality,Looking for Love,IM YOUR ANGEL(Duet with Celine Dion), Money Makes The World( With Nas),ANDTHE 3-TIME GRAMMY WINNER, I BELIEVE I CAN FLY. The Only tracksthat I consider FILLERS was:#6,#7 and the Flamenco Song #10.Still a Strong and Great Double CD to haved in the R.KellyCollection.SO GO AND BUY IT!."
4,A Must Buy!!!,"It has definitely been a long time coming for this new R. Kelly creation. I must say it's been worth the wait. This two CD collection satisfies the needs of every listener. It combines up tempo tracks with talented MCs like Jay-Z, Noreaga, and Foxy; but it also fulfills the needs of those who just want to hear a couple of smooth ballads--Don't Put Me Out and Etcetera are two of my favorites.I think what makes this CD so great is its originality. It's like no other CD you've ever heard before. It showcases R. Kelly's musical gift and lets the listener be a part of that for a couple of hours.I must say, however, that Disc #1 seems to surpass Disc #2 in terms of entertainment value. I often find myself forgetting that he's even created two CDs. In any case, they are both wonderful and worth every dollar."
2,"Nowhere as good as ""12-Play"".","Listeners!--It would be better to get a new copy of R. Kelly's ""12-Play"" than to get this. This is obviously bloated, bombastic retail baiting. I personally liked him better when he was with Public Annoucement."
1,I have had bad luck with gurney's seeds and service.,With a lot of luck you may get every thing you order and paid for. they say there the best when it comes to helping you. if any thing is not right they don't give you your money back NO they keep it.
1,Plant classification,"I purchased this book to use in indentifying Georgia native trees and plants but found it not to be very helpful. There were very few picture illustrations that I could use in identifying the plants. It is simply a printed list of the different plants with little illustration and if you don't know what the plant looks like, it is of no use."
5,AWESOME!!!!,"He is the ""MAN""!!I spend hours listen to this man sing.He has the sexiest voice, and his singing is just so relaxing.You ""ROCK"" Reverend Camden!!!"
5,"Fantastic, best dried soup ever","This is by far the best dried soup I've ever had, and definitely better than both mom's and my homemade split pea. My girlfriend can't get enough of it either, and its perfect for vegans like me."
5,quick and tasty,This is probably one of my favorite dried-in-a-bag soups. I just had some tonight. It would be nice if there were more noodles though.
3,Heavenly Soup with Too Much Salt.,Absolutely delicious soup. Love the macaroni that has been added. Great soup to serve to Company and I did just that. Even they comnmented on how much salt was in the soup.
3,Extreme Salt,The flavor of this soup is fine except for the extreme saltiness. The salt content needs to be cut in half at least for this soup to get more than 3 stars.
2,Resource Hog,"If you are considering this product, I would suggest that you be sure that your computer meets the high end of the specs. My system has a P4 running at 2GHz with 2 GB of RAM and the LifeCam constantly froze. I finally returned the VX-6000 and replaced it with the VX-1000 which ran fine and is performing well."
5,Lifecam Works As Advertized,"I give the product 5 stars, works great with both microsoft live messenger IM as well as Yahoo IM. Picture quality is very good. I really like the graphics that you can add to your pictures to make them more personal and not just another picture. It works well in both taking still pictures as well as video. I use this product almost daily. At the Amazon price point well worth it."
3,Software Bugs,"Some other reviews here had similar problems to mine. Please don't think we are bad mouthing Microsoft. The problems are ligit. Seems to only be an issue if you have other USB devices (like most of us). Bottom line the camera would not work. If you check device manager and have an error 19, then that is the same as me. MS's website is no help. A Google search and 8 hours later I got it to work, but I bought this beacuse I thought MS would at least have the inside track on software issues. By the way, I dumped my Logitech pro5000 due to software problems too, so it's worse then this Microsoft product. Good luck. If you get it to work, it is a nice camera and works well with Skyp (my primary use of it)."
3,Nice little computer camera,"I like the fact that this camera has a built-in microphone; one less thing to connect to a USB port. The top button automatically starts Live Messenger. Movement capturing is not the smoothest I've seen, but considering size and price, it is acceptable. The sound is excellent. It attaches nicely on top of LCD monitors. I had this camera for a couple of months now and didn't have any problems.Update: The microphone stopped working, the video is still good."
2,It works!,I purchased originally a Logitech STB Camera. The drivers just weren't compatible with zone alarm and slowed down my other machine.The picture from this camera just doesn't compare with Logitech. And the lowlight quality of this camera is very bad.On the brighter side it is microsoft and it is compatible with whatever MS system or software you are running.Easy install eminently compatible but dismal in all other respects.I have nothing against Microsoft and for the price I expected much more.
1,I hate this camera.,"I found this product suffers from horrible interference with the mic. Your video partner will hear a low, growling feedback noise and barely able to make out what you are saying. Whacking it hard against the knee solves the problem, but handling it again may set it off again. There are many reports of this problem, with complicated fixes which involve cracking the unit open and snipping some wires.The large button on top opens MSN Live Messenger. This is NOT programmable. It is almost impossible to adjust the camera without accidentally hitting the button, and when I'm using Skype I sure don't want MSN popping up in the foreground. A workaround for this involves renaming the file ""C:\Program Files\Microsoft LifeCam\IcePick.exe"" to something else.Sometimes the green ""activity"" light stays on after calls have been terminated, making me quite paranoid that someone is looking at me through a trojan on my computer."
2,Don't Buy this Camera! ITS JUNK AND DEFECTIVE IN DESIGN,The resolution is decent not great. Its a camera for BSing around with friends but if you want crystal clear video that is colorful this camera falls short. Also the rubber ring around the lens degrades and turns sticky. Feels like glue as it breaks down. After a few months the rubber ring really began to degrade. I became concened the residue could be toxic and alarted MSFT. MSFT gave me the run around for 3+ hours on the phone and then instead of refunding me for what I beleive is a defect in design (unvulcanized rubber after some reasearch) they had the audacity to send me used one in an opened box. The box was thrashed and was clearly someone elses junk. You can see the proof here: http://www.flickr.com/photos/39776870@N05/sets/72157620706497852/
2,"Video image is good, but the sounds doesn't work","I purchased two of these, one for my parents, one for my sister. It was easy to install. the Video image looks great, but the microphones will not work on either one. The documentation provided with the product is crappy."
1,what a piece of crap!,"I just bought one of these and installed it in a Windows Vista system. You'd think a Microsoft product would work with Vista, but it doesn't. Some of the controls are mysteriously greyed-out. I did a web search, and this is a common problem (many threads from June 2009). The Microsoft advice? Do a ""Clean Reboot"" - Give ME A BREAK!DO NOT BUY THIS WEBCAM."
1,Terrible Quality,When buying a web cam that is advertised as being High Definition you expect pretty good quality. What I got was not high definition at all. Even by normal definition standards the quality was absolutely terrible.
4,"Good webcam, good price","Video quality is clear, and motion is fairly clean (not so many frame skips that it looks like stop-motion). My pets have graciously put it through QC testing (it's taken a fall on a few occasions), and it has passed every test so far so I'd say it's durable."
1,good video...BAD microphone,"I have bought many things in amazon, and this one is the first time that something does not work correctly.I tested the camera in 3 different computers and the result is the same .... only noise when I use the microphone of the camera.I return to my old USB camera.BAD, BAD CHOICE."
1,what a disappointment,"Wouldn't stop freezing as soon as i installed on my average windows xp laptop. that without even being online, just testing on my computer. i am not a very picky shopper and this is my first return from amazon. i guess if you have a brand new computer with lots of memory and a super fast connection, the image is good. for me, it was a waste of time."
3,Not as great as I thought...,I think this is Not a New WebCam....so that's why the Video quality is so poor...//I won't recommend it from this store...
4,works as advertised,I've used this camera for about two months. It's easy to setup and it works as advertised.
1,Not Vista Compatible,"This product is not Vista compatible (it will work, but the sync between the sound and video is far off, making it horrible); Microsoft does not anticipate more drivers and updates for this product, instead, you will have to purchase their new line of webcams that are ""Made for Vista"" instead of just this ""Vista Compatible""."
2,Video Quality Poor,"Bought a Logitech Fusion and loved the quality of the camera and kids loved the software but had a lot of difficulty with conflicts between the Logitech drivers and my Media Center PC. Then read a number of reviews explaining this problem. Decided to try the Microsoft. Installation was easy but the video is much, much worse than the Fusion. Microsoft claims a true 1.3 MP video (compared to Fusion's 640x480) but it is very noticeably poorer quality than the Logitech. If only I could get Logitech and Media Center to get along."
2,"Great webcam, but...","The image is great, the extra bells-and-whistles are cool, the microphone is very sensitive and the noise-cancelling feature really works.BUT... it is not compatible with Windows Vista yet. It is quite frustrating!"
1,Stay away,"Don't bother. I didn't buy the camera, i actually won it, and boy do I wish I could return it. I use vista and I get nothing but problems. Sound is out of sync, the software is horrendously crappy (not even all of the options work. How can it have options I can't configure when this was supposed to be top of the line?).Save your money and get a logitech or something."
3,Questions for posters,"Woould those who post ratings please tell what size cpu and motherboards you are using? It would help the rest of us know if the reason for the bad reviews are because the computers are older and smaller than P4's. I have intel pro camera that are really good, but would like to upgrade and I can't tell from the reviews if this Microsoft camera would be a good replacement.I gave a 3 rating because I had to rate to post.. 3 in midway.Thank you"
4,Great Cam; Easy to Use,"Simple, easy instructions; good image and sound quality. Would like more fine-tunimg color capabilities, but not necessary."
4,Microsoft Life Cam VX-6000,"This webcam was a replacement for the our last Microsoft Lifecam VX-6000 which got hit by lightning. We liked this webcam so much that we did not even think of looking for a different model to replace it. Instead, we bought the exact same model, but this time we were more smart about it, we purchased it on-line instead of at a local store. We use this web cam quite frequently for our two small children to talk/see to their granparents over the internet. In fact, my parents and my in-laws use the same camera. The picture is great and the one-touch button on the top of the camera is something my parents like because they do not need to try to find the software to run the camera. Once the button is pressed the software automatically starts."
5,This will literally change how we communicate,This web cam in conjunction with the Live Messenger software is absolutely terrific. The initial software setup takes some time but after that you are holding live quality sound and video conferencing in moments. The zoom feature works great (you have to click the little star next to the picture of a camera on the video screen that shows yourself). Here you can zoom in and out as well as pan. I bought one for mine and my wife's parent's who live across the country. I was so impressed I am buying one for her two sisters as well as my brother and sister. Go Microsoft and the Microsoft haters can all give it a rest!
5,Microsoft LifeCam vx-6000,"I love my little tiny camera. My husband who has never seen his third granddaughter, now visits with her every day. He does not fly and she lives in Oregon. He can read her stories and tell her jokes. It is wonderful!No problem to set up and it takes up very little spaceThe picture is good, the sound is excellent, it is easy to call, and it does not cost anything , What a great Christmas present for the whole family."
1,MS Life Cam VX-6000,Could no install drivers. Tried on several computers with windows XP. Looks like there is a known issue with this camera installation. Returned to merchant.
2,software problems,"I installed the software and it crashed my computer, I am running Windows XP. It took forever to uninstall and now I keep getting error messages when I go on AOL. I use the cam on Yahoo messenger but no sound, anyone know how to fix my problems now?"
4,a bit greenish,"The color is a bit off, rendering everything a bit green, but otherwise no complaints."
2,Very poor image quality,I wish I had saved a clip from this camera. Very poor quality - grainy and distorted colors at all resolutions in both low-light and full-light.Thankfully Amazon has a great return policy!
2,Faulty Microphone,"I recently had to send this product back after several weeks. The microphone worked sporadically. The picture, when used primarily with Skype, was no problem at all. I'm exchanging the product so we'll see what luck I have on the second one."
4,great for the price,for the price this cam is great but it is not the best out there. Thumbs up for mid to low budget cam.
3,I expected more,"After installing my new LifeCam VX-6000, I am disappointed in some of the areas of functioning and ease of use. Where do I start?1. The cam will not ""stay in one place"" - it moves too easily2. I am not happy with the way the ""controls"" for setting up a clearerpicture; There is not enough information easily obtainable to helpmake adjustments.3. In the middle of a Window's Live Messenger video call to my son inOsceola, Wisconsin, it stopped!4. I cannot get it to work properly with my instant messaging. My computer is a new PowerSpec Intel Pentium 4 with Windows XP Home Edition.I should not be having ANY trouble, after 4 weeks I am extremely disappointed..."
4,Good quality camera !,Hello Everyone!I would recommend installing the drivers from microsoft website.Software in boxes we buy are at least six months old.Stuff and files get updated all the time.I had to do this because i have an older laptop and running XP. So save some hassle and try this! The camera works great!
4,LifeCam - Real Images,"This webcam is inexpensive but ""tops"". The clarity and effectiveness is more than I imagined. I would recommend it to anyone."
2,Microsoft admits cam is buggy!,"This cam will work on some computers and fail on others.The software package is the problem, the actual camera works.The reason I purchased was the resolution, but without being able to change these controls the camera is worthless.The Lifecam software freezes and shows 100% CPU in Task Manager.Camera software works on an older computer from 2001 though? Support admits that there are issues still unknown with this software."
2,Decent value for price paid.,"I paid for this web camera $37. Quality is good as soon as camera not more than 2 feet's from you. Other wise if you getting fuser from camera, quality falling. Be careful with microphone, it is very sensitive and picking all noses around. It you worried about how much you want to pay for camera it will be nice pick, but if you do not care of price than find something better."
1,Horribe Static and Echo,"I was initially excited about this cam, but after installation, I quickly realized it was a bad investment. It is easy to install and set-up, but the constant static makes it unbearable to have a conversation what-so-ever. We actually have to put the camera as far away from the computer to reduce the noise, but even then, it is still readily apparent. And, since it is on the side, you have the camera shooting the side of you while you look at the computer. There is also a very loud echo. The video quality is also lacking for a camera of this price. I highly recommend looking elsewhere for a camera."
1,Static intolerable on my Dell Laptops,I bought two of these cameras for my Dell D620 and Inspiron 6100 laptops and on each system I encountered extreme noise and static in the audio that I was not able to eliminate.
4,Echo chamber,I first bought the Logitech 5000 and returned it after hours of problems I will not go into here. I then bought the MS LifeCam VX-6000 and over all I like it but I have the same problem as others with the echo chamber audio. No one has a good idea why it does it. It has even affected my music files and they also have a echo sound when I play them. Also I have not been able to make the face tracking work. I have to use MS messenger since the family and friends I know all use that program. Skype works fine but you would think MS LifeCam would work with MS Messenger. Or would you?
3,Philips brand webcams are much better than Microsoft or Logitech,"I did an extensive WRITTEN comparative study of quality and price of webcams. Plus, I own this and 2 versions of Philips. Philips wins hands down."
2,No good,The only thing I liked about this cam is that it had good effects & filters but the picture quality was not good at all.I would not recommend.
1,Will not install,"I'm a deployed soldier and bought this webcam to keep in touch with my girlfriend back home. She got it and put the install cd in and waited, and waited, and waited. But it would not install. I'm extremely unhappy with this product and wish I hadn't wasted my hard-earned money on it."
1,Software doesnt load,"The software wouldn't load - couldn't get it to work from the website, the CD, etc. Read some reviews on boards after I tried and found others had the same problem.Had to return it."
3,satisfactory,I bought this for my laptop and seems to work pretty well. It picks up a lot of noise interference when sitting on top of my screen which forces me to place it off to the side or where ever I can find. So rather than having the people I'm chatting with look squarely at my face they usually get a nice view of what's up my nose. Another quirk is I have noticed the status light on even though I'm not using it. Probably would not buy again.
1,Lousy Camera,"Bought this camera as an ""upgrade"" for an older L***tech laptop web cam. What a waste of money! The picture on this thing is horrible! Even though the specs on this camera are much better, my older camera's video is waaay better. The video from this hunk-o-junk is very blurry and grainy. The sound seems to be okay, but I never really paid attention because the video was so bad. M$ makes decent keyboards and mice, but if this is the best web cam they can make, they need to get out of this market. I'll stick with L***tech."
2,Why is it freezing?????,I purchased 2 of the VX-6000 Web Cams in March 2008 so we could see our grandaughter in another state. One of them is running on a Vista and the other on a XP computer. I couldn't tell you how many hours and days we have messed with these trying to get them to work. It is so frustrating. Right when you think you have figured it out - they freeze up again. It is to late for me to return them since it is now September 2008....my next thing is to call Microsoft and if that doesn't work - I will put them in the closet along with the other dumb purchases I have made. If something happens where I end up figuring them out - I will post what I am doing wrong.
5,Just what I had hoped!,This was great. It was a gift for my mother-in-law to keep in touch with her grandaughter who is overseas for a year. She loves it!
5,Great Web-cam for the money,This is my third web cam. My first was a Veo which was very good until my dog ate the wires. The second one was a HUE. It lasted about 2 months. It was $14.99 and it is true you get what you pay for. I would recommend this web cam for everyone.
4,"Okay, but not terrific","The VX-6000 is an okay, but not spectacular, performer. The adjustable focus is a plus, but image resolution is nothing to write home about. The wide angle lens is a bit too wide for my liking. The 3x digital zoom is okay, but as with all digital zooms, the image is degraded.The mount for the camera is cleverly designed and can be used in a variety of situations.Software was a problem free install and the control panel offers all the adustments you might want. There are a few animated effects that might entertain kids for a few minutes.The microphone in my unit generates a lot of noise, so I'll be giving Microsoft a shout.Overall, it's not a bad unit. Better than a lot of the no-name units out there, but perhaps not as good as the more expensive Logitech units. One big disappointment is that the call button works only with Microsoft Messenger. Big mistake in my view.Jerry"
4,Nice webcam,"I really like this webcam. It has good image and full-motion quality. The housing is decent, and the camera mounted fine on my desktop LCD. It's not too large, so it's not an eye sore. One thing that kind of bugged me is the button on top of the webcam. I found that it was easy to accidentally press it when positioning the webcam. Pressing this button either launches Windows Live Messenger (if you have it installed), or asks you if you want to download it. So even if you don't have the messenger client installed, you still get a popup if you press the button by accident. Microsoft boasts that the built-in microphone is unidirectional, which to me means better echo control, but unless you have some other means of canceling echo, you can still expect to hear some. Well, to be accurate, the other people you talk with over video conferencing will hear the echo. Whether or not a user of this webcam will hear echo depends on the other person's environment."
1,Microsoft should be ashamed,"I got this webcam for my birthday. First of all, the accompanying software will not install on Windows XP 64-bit edition. The CD does contain drivers for Windows XP 64-bit, but I never got them to work (and I am an IT professional). The installation seemed work fine, but everytime I rebooted my computer, it detected the camera as new hardware. Microsoft's support requires you to first pay $30, before they will lift a finger. No way I would do that on a $50 product. On a laptop with Windows XP 32-edition, it did not want to work with Microsoft's own Messenger software. So we sent it back and got a Logitech Pro 9000 instead. That one worked straight away."
3,Focus problems,"Good product for typical intended use. Great resolution, sharp image. Unfortunately, I wanted to use it for a time lapse of a constrution project. It won't focus beyond 10 m (or 30 feet)."
3,Great video but sound could use some improvement,"The video is great, the only downside is the manual focus. The sound is clear but generates a lot of feedback."
4,where is the zoom?,Pretty nice video and sound clarity but i do not get any zoom. its supposed to be 3x zoom. am i misunderstanding it?A
5,Microsoft LifeCam VX-6000,"This a great webcam. It can take still photos up to 5 mega pixels and a built in Microphone ,Microsoft LifeCam VX-6000 ( 68C-00001 )"
2,Microsoft LifeCam VX-6000 Works Poorly On Vista,"I have a new Dell Dimension E520 with Vista Business. I bought the VX-6000 because it was the only web cam I could find that had Vista drivers, although I had to download the Vista drivers. The VX-6000 has poor video and audio, and when I upload a wmv file (only format produced) to YouTube, the audio and video are out of sync. (Resolution was YouTube-recommended 320x240.)I am guessing the problem is lack of maturity of the drivers for Vista. In any case, this product does not work well on Vista."
2,Disapointment,"I was very disappointed with the quality of picture from this LifeCam. It's extremely grainy. Compared to the quality in the 3000 model, this one is very poor."
4,Good webcam if you get it on sale.,"I've had the VX-6000 for about 2 weeks now and overall I've been very happy with it. Installation is very simple and straightforward. I bought one for myself and one for my parents and my mother was even able to get it installed and working. My only complaint is that when I tried using this webcam with Yahoo IM, the picture quality was not as high as when I used it with Windows Live and the video kept freezing. As long as I use it with Windows Live it works well and delivers a nice video quality. With that said, I think this webcam is a great deal for what Amazon was charging. Best Buy and Circuit City were selling it for about 20 dollars more and I don't know that it is worth that much."
4,Works as expected,"I purchased this webcam because I am a long time user of Microsoft products, the price was right, and I liked the design. I use it for video chatting on Windows Live Messenger and it works great. As with any web cam you have to adjust room lighting for the best image quality - I use a desk lamp for additional light. The frame rate is slow, but what I expected for a web cam. I am very satisfied with my purchase."
2,Expected better from Microsoft,"Others have stated the problems well.This thing does not play well with others. I wanted a a camera I could move about for Skype with grandchildren showing them whatever we were talking about.It installs easily but it is hard to keep it as default camera. Camera and mic on Dell monitor really have problems when the LifeCam is plugged in as well.I bought Microsoft camera thinking it would be safe as Microsoft also develop Windows 7, my operating system. I thought I would not have conflicts between their device and other USB items or monitor camera.Picture quality is excellent. Microphone is ok.But, even when the Lifecam camera is working as I wish, the Lifecam microphone may or may not work.I would not recommend to friend."
3,USB video camera,"This was my first video camera. It's OK but the 720p LifeCam Cinema is much better and well worth its higher price. The video quality on this camera is OK in good light conditions but poor in lower light - the Cinema has a much better image (at the same resolution), especially at low light levels. I haven't tried any of the messenger functions so I can't comment there. It's an OK first camera but you should upgrade if you really want to do videos."
2,Review,"Lousy documentation...Turns off, on etc. type stuff.Wasted money....I will try using it with my nextcomputer about a year from nowwith Vista and see if that makesit work better.AFTER the bugs are out of Vista :)Lousy documentation"
1,CAMERA SOFTWARE LOCKS UP PC,AFTER INSTALLING THE CAMERA SOFTWARE I NOTICE MY PC WOULD JUST STOP RESPONDING AND WOULD CRASH MSOFFICE. I UNINSTALLED IT AND REINSTALLED IT AND IT WOULD LOCK IT UP OVER AGAIN. AFTER RESEARCHING FURTHER ON THE CAMERA I NOTICE A WEB SITE HAD NEGATIVE REVIEWS WITH IT AND ALSO MS CUSTOMER SERVICE. THAT IS WHY I DECIDED TO RETURN THE ITEM AND GET A REFUND
4,Hot Hot Hot!,"The directions on the can tell you to add the entire contents of the can into your dish....which will make this quite hot. If you would like a milder flavor, consider starting with 1/4 of the can and then go from there. This is excellant with a side dish of jasmine rice. My panang chicken was wonderful and I do suggest adding water chestnuts, baby corn, carrots or green onion to this dish. Also, check your local Asian market for lower prices on this item. I bought one can for less than $2 and cans of coconut milk 2 for $1. A $3 cost to feed a family of four for a lot less than the price of Thai take-out."
2,Review,Did not provide as much pressure as the old one. When water was turned off it kept pouring out of it
5,Fantastic Book,"Anybody who doesn't like this book doesn't appreciate good photojournalism. I spent hours examining the photos which were taken in big cities and small towns across America, and I enjoyed the personal stories behind each picture. Every picture tells a story, and this book tells hundreds. Buy this book. You won't regret it."
5,excellent value,"I recieved my book in a matter of days and it was in pristine condition, exactly as described (or a bit better) than was read on line.Sincerely, Linda"
5,Great,"I bought this for my girlfriend whose husband is deoloyed in Iraq. She got the book first and the cover followed a few weeks later. She loved it and I had NO Problems with the cover order. I did order in Jan after the holiday rush. Suggest everyone who has had a problem, give them a second chance. They are doing a great job for only $5.00."
1,A MEDIOCRE AMATEUR PHOTO CONTEST,"Reviewing AMERICA 24-7, it soon became apparent that this highly hyped, but mediocre collection of mostly amateur photographs (gathered through a nationwide photo contest) is less about photography and photojournalism than about promoting it's main sponsor - a digital camera company. Combine sentimental photographs with washed out printing (at least in the copy I received), and 24-7 becomes one of the least appealing photographic books that have crossed my desk in a long time. To find photojournalism (and quality printing) this fall, look for National Geographic's THROUGH THE LENS"
3,How do I contact these people????,"I just recieved a custom cover in exactly 20 days. Looks great and the book itself is a nice piece. Only problem is that I ordered 4 customs covers using the same photo/layout. Apperantly that little box for Quantity doesn't do much other that charge more for a single cover. I've looked all over there site and can find nothing as a contact. No email address, no phone number and the return address is a PO Box in CA. So, before I refuse the charge does anyone have contact info for this shady operation? It sounds as though some have been down this road before."
4,My cover looks great,Because only the squeaky wheels are being heard I wanted to write and say that I did get my cover in time for Christmas and I like it alot. I had to call customer service once to confirm my order but whoever I talked to was pretty nice. Overall the book with the cover made a super present for my Dad.
4,The more things change...,a first class photography volume. I was suprised to see America portrayed in such a traditional light but the pictures are a wonderful window into American life today. The book is hefty but with so many pictures you really get a chance to see the whole America.
4,Forget the custom cover,"The book is great but don't fall for the custom cover. Although it is a great idea, the company is not very customer friendly. After you order, you are told the projected ship date which is 2 weeks. They do not respond to emails. Whatever you do...do not order from this company. In fact, I am surprised Amazon is supporting them."
1,"Since you cant judge a book by its cover, I have no opinion","On 11/25/03 I ordered the custom cover, w/a 2 week promise of delivery. Still not here. One email from the company promised to send a second cover, But I have not received that either. Does anyone know where this company is physically located, or have a telephone number or address for them?"
5,WOnderful Book!,"I remember seeing ""A Day in the Life of America"" in high school, and was completely captivated - I had never seen the rest of the country before, and it absolutely fascinated me. When I flipped through the pages of this book, I felt exactly the same way - somewhat nostalgic, and hopeful, a sense of family - and the photos are a thousand times better than ""A Day in the Life of America"" - the organizers did an amazing job. And the ""personal photo on the cover"" is brilliant - this is going to be the easiest christmas shopping year ever!"
4,Great felling shave,"I had been looking in stores for quite some time for a badger hair shaving brushwith no success. So I then tried online and there it was. So easy for an 84yr. oldto order.The Omega brush is everything I'd hoped for, soft to the cheek, full bodied and usesthe smallest amount of soap. My dad always said ""a beard well shaved is one thatuses the least amount of soap."" or ""a beard well lathered is not a beard well shaved.""I have had my Omega around a month and every day I am glad I went to Amazon.Enough said,HEM"
2,MATERIAL IS NOT GOOD QUALITY!!,"I ordered this sheet because of the size...need a 82"" size...but I could not find one. The material is very cheap and not very good for my husband's hospital bed. I would have sent it back...since the price is too costly for the quality...but I needed a sheet. I do not know why Invacare made a bed in a size that I cannot find sheets for!!"
2,It is ok if you like old time gospel I like more contemperary,It is ok if you like old time gospel I like stuff more like mercy me or here I am to worship just not my cup of tea
2,good beats not so good raps,"lil wyte is a novelty act.plain and simple.the fact he's white shouldnt have anything to do with it,but it DOES.the fact he keeps mentioning only just confirms this.his voice is a medium pitch,very raspy monotone bark which is like a camp,wispy version of another novelty rapper,DMX.his flow is in much the same vein of the other 36 rappers, AABB,ABAB rhyming paterns throughout.this isnt necessarily a bad thing,as it adds to the flow of the beats.just to show im not just mindlessly hating on this album,i do own it!!! and it must be doing rather well on the dust gathering mission i sent it on under my bed!!! in short,paul and juicy should stop signing wack rappers,realise less albums,and when a quality rapper like T-Rock comes along,dont mess him about!!!!"
1,please...,"Lil'Wyte is just 36's answer to Eminem. He is only here to fill the void left by Gangsta Boo and T-Rock, which he comes nowhere remotely close to filling, 36 would be much better off if they just got rid of him. I wish I could rate 0 stars, save your money and stay away from this if you are a true 36 fan."
1,Some BS,I was hoping this was all a joke. A white rapper who feeds off of black stereotypes. Get a life. Go check out Sonic Jihad by Paris. Lil Whyte is a joke.
2,lil wyte original or not.,"I've herd this whole album,and to me it does'nt have any originallity.I,ve been a Triple six fan since 94,so I've seen everbody come in and now leave.The point i,m tryin to get at is if you listen to old Playa fly,skinny pimp.He copy's the sound witch has gotten stale.This is the worst cd from hcp thier beats are the only good thing from them now."
3,wyte is tyte but there's a problem!,"yo, dont get me wrong tha boy is tyte, he can spit like no other, and paul and tha juice man provided some of tha tightest beats they ever produced BUT i dont know if anyone picked up on it or even cared but i did pick up and i do care... but this wyte boy is throwin tha N-word around, i understand he one of tha homies and they might allow him to say that, but where im from and tha rest of tha world, i dont think we ready for that quite yet, i understand he not sayin it to anyone degradingly but like i said we not ready for that to be put on an album for tha world to hear quite yet, like i said, cuz out tha N-word and tha boy is wicked!"
1,Shy Trembling Lil Violet,"Finally, a white rapper who isn't afraid to admit that, when the lights go down, he does too--on his homeys. For too long now, the rap world has shied away from expressing these perfectly natural desires and fantasies. But here comes LW to proudly proclaim his love for his fellow man, a love that hitherto had dared not speak its name. And as if that weren't enough, LW tells us in track 27 (""The Lil Gal Within Me"") of his long years of frustration being a delicate black girl trapped in the body of an angry posturing macho white rapper, longing for the smothering embrace of her strong proud ebony man. What courage! You go, girl!"
4,"""BEST SOLO TRIPLE SIX RAPPER SINCE KINGPIN SKINNY PIMP""","This was undoubtedly the best album of 2003, and showcases the next big talent in the rap game. Lil Wyte is a pretty good lyricist and his flow is original. His debut blows all of Feminem's material out of the water. From the first track ""Doubt Me Now,"" I was amazed at Wyte's beats and flow, which sound nothing like typical Paul & J productions. Other standout cuts include ""Oxycontin,"" ""My Smokin Song,"" and ""Acid."" Overall, Doubt Me Now is a very good album, and is a solid debut for this up & coming rapper."
3,Credit Where It's Due,"aight, the intro is wack, no doubt. but this album does have a few tracks that show his potential. i wouldnt be surprised to see this kid make it in the future..... with the right producer. Lyrically, he's talented, but some of the rhymes sound like somethin the average underground backpacker would spit. i'd say give him a few years to fall in his zone and he may be back around."
5,best cd to drink a beer to,"hey matt morgret tell that to lil wyte, or the juice man...maybe dj paul...theyll like that"
4,Lil Wyte-Doubt Me Now,Lil Wyte might be a dorky ... but he got some tight liks and a nice flow. This CD is bangin. If the production on the up coming Three 6 album Da Unbreakbles is anything like this it's gonna be the dopest 3-6 album since Chp.2 Not a weak trak on Lil Wyte you can bump it all the way through. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is Wyte's flow it's a lil repititve at times. . .
4,once again tha super producers make another great one,"lil wyte's doubt me now is off tha hook. it also has some sweet beats like com'n yo direction, which is now the party song here in TN., and crash da club, this cd is a must for anybody that likes 3-6 and their beats."
4,Go Get this,"Man this is one of the best premier albums of this year. Lil Wyte is keeping it gangsta on this cd. He is good enough to compete with eminem and he is definitely better than bubba sparxx! His flow is repetitive sometimes, but with triple six beats behind him and a tight rap voice you will get over that. It's only two songs on the disc that I don't really like and that's number 10 and number 4."
5,original memphis rap sound,"This album has the same content as the previous HCP albums, which is the best rap music on the market right now. Lil Wyte's songs have unique beats with rhymes that could put Eminem to shame. This album has to be the best recently released rap album in any type of rap category. Lil Wyte's album will leave you with more respect towards the south memphis rap scene. Doubt Me Now will definitely give Lil' Wyte and HCP more fame and attention they deserve for their productions."
2,no sir,i bought this cd thinking that it was good. i had this cd for about 5 months and never got a chance to really listen to it. finally did and i only liked like 5 songs on here.
3,Funny,"If the man who created the book and T.V. series ""The Addams Family"" comes this great ""freak book."" Some disturbing photos. (Although, wasn't that the point, Charles?)"
2,"Slayers Try continues, but the interest wanes...","I found this tape rather immature in design, plotting and pacing until the last episode when all hell broke loose and it got back on track. Too much talking with too many new and wierd characters with designs right out of a 10th grader's sketchbook made this tape rather boring. I'm hoping the final episode is indicative of things to come...by the end of the third episode on this tape I wanted to cancel my order for the remainder of this series. Xellos is more direct and confrontational then before, yet the main throng of characters lulled into cliche and predictable behavior through out the tape. Make your own opinion. I am sure the Slayers fans are very forgiving of anything disappointing in this installment."
4,"Whether you like Hilary or not, you have to admit...","Whether you like Hilary Duff or not you have to admit she is stunningly beautiful. Although it's aimed at young girls, it disturbs me a bit to see young girls hanging huge pictures of Hilary in their house. Is that just me? Well, whatever your prefrence, if you are a fan of Hilary or even if you're not (and you're just wowed by her beauty) you'll probably enjoy this calender."
2,WASTE!,"I got this calendar when I was a big fan of Hilary Duff and I loved it at first even though some of the pictures were weird. Now I regret buying it because I'm not such a big fan of her anymore and it was a really expensive calendar..definitely not worth it!! I still rated it 2 stars coz if u r a big fan and continue being one then this calendar is ok since after 2004 is over u can cut out the pics and stick them up. So if ur planning to buy this calendar and ur a big fan of hilary duff, just think again because soon you might not be the big fan u once were!"
1,The Calendar is terrible,"Don't get me wrong, I would NEVER, EVER waste my money on a stupid calendar like this, but I just saw one hanging in my friend's little sister's room and I just had to slam it. I'm sorry, but Hilary Duff is in no way a good role model. The pictures are so terrible and they make her look about 10 times heavier than she really is.Like, save your money. There are a zillion other calendars that are more eye-appealing. Hilary Duff's calendar will make your eye swollen or something."
5,YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A TEACHER,"You don't have to be a teacher to enjoy this album. We all have classroom memories that will be stirred by the selections. We have teachers than have inspired us; we perhaps have even known our own ""Bill, the janitor."" The vocal quality is superb; the sound quality is excellent. This is probably the best gift you could give to a teacher, or to anyone who loves kids. If you buy one as a gift for your favorite teacher, just make sure you have one to keep for yourself."
4,Author interviewed on Diane Rehm show (NPR),"I heard Evan Imber-Black interviewed on the Diane Rehm show on NPR March 19th. Fascinating comments and great call-in questions from radio listeners. She talked about the types of secrets: toxic, dangerous... and who ""owns"" a secret. Also she talked about how to go about revealing a secret. Great interview, sounds like an informative book."
2,NORPRO PASTRY BRUSH,"First use was fine...after that, always had to pull little bristles from the brush off the food or off the brush before it got to the food. Not recommended."
2,"""LAST TIME AROUND"" KEEP YOUR HAND OUTTA MY POCKET!!!","I appear to be the 'odd man out' here! I'm a huge Buddy Guy fan, but this live show at Legends I can only recommend to those who must, for whatever reason, have it all. Now, I only write this because of the four and five star reviews posted which prompted me to take a chance on this one. As all reviews are, ultimately, subjective, no ill-will is intended here. However, for me, this show just did not cut it. It has its moments, but not enough of 'em. 'Nuf said!"
3,A Solid Effort!,"There's more to communications than words, and according to Colleen McKenna you'll have to master a diverse set of self-expression skills if you want to succeed in business. In her book, McKenna covers diverse topics ranging from speaking, writing and listening, to asserting yourself, solving problems and dealing with put-downs. The impressive breadth of the book is also its greatest weakness, in that with so much ground to cover, McKenna is in no position to delve deeply into any one point. As a result, the chapters are lacking in detail. However, each section does provide a wonderful introduction to issues like the problems of communicating with members of the opposite sex and the best ways to prepare for a public speaking engagement. We [...] recommend this book to professionals interested in getting a well-rounded sample of several communications disciplines before plunging into more in-depth research."
3,Powerful Communication Skills,"I bought this book for my adult children entering the work force. I thought gaining confidence in communication would help them on the job front. When the book came I read it first and I was disappointed. It covers what any speech 101 class would. Not a lot of substance here. I guess review is good, but no ""A-ha"" suggestions."
4,The old bait and switch,"This is a good CD, but I was nonplussed and abashed (better than being shocked and awed (in the wrong way) I guess) because it is not really a ""Best Of"" IMO: it's the best of three albums from the mid-to-late 1990s is all!Arghh! I was hoping to get some of the old stuff here. I guess I'll have to order either ""As It All Began: The Best of John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers 1964-1969"" &/or ""20th Century Masters - The Millennium Collection: The Best of John Mayall"" to scratch that itch.Based on Mayall's ""Jazz Blues Fusion"" (probably my favorite live album ever) I'm expecting the ""real"" best of to be great.Now why was the crowd yelling for ""Room to Move"" during those concerts, yet that song does not appear on ANY of the best of compilations?!?"
5,Works!,"I couldn't find this part in local stores. I later discovered that Tecumseh Engine was no more (no wonder I got my lawnmower so cheap!). It fits, it works, the price is fair and MowTown shipped it within a week. All good. I have a Yardman 430 mower with a Tecumseh LV148EA/LV195EA engine."
5,Lawnboy air filter,I ordered this filter for my lawnmower and it was the same thing that I paid more for locally. It works just fine and is exactly the same as the original. I am very pleased and will order more next year.
1,This author must not have known Eddie. Very inaccurate. A work of fiction,WHAT WAS HE THINKING...THIS GUY DIDN'T EVEN KNOW EDDIE BECAUSE HE IS SO WRONG ABOUT THE FACTS. DON'T BUY THIS BOOK. Have you heard of a 'million little pieces'? This book belongs in the fiction category.
4,It all fits in mine.,"I read the review about the size of the case after my order was placed and I was prepared to be disappointed. I found, however, if I pushed the printer into the top of the space and installed the velcro attached pad along the bottom of the printer, there was still plenty of room for all the power cords etc to lie at the bottom of the case (in the handy pouch that came with it). If you try to put the printer at the bottom, which would make more sense, you're out of luck. The fact that the fit is counter-intuitive and there are no instructions cost this nice sturdy case one star.This is an addition to the above review. If I could figure out how to give the fifth star back, I would. The lady that I gave this case to had her luggage left out (by Delta) in a hard rain for about 2 hours. Everything was soaked including this case, but the printer was dry and protected. This is great protection for the price!"
2,Too small!,I purchased this for my Deskjet 460C so I would be able to transport my printer and have it padded and protected-no way would it fit with the padding in place. Why bother with a case when a backpack will offer just as much protection for the printer. Maybe it shouldn't be recommended for this particular printer.
2,Be aware of the discussion,"I also watched this concert on PBS, and agree with other reviewers that the performances and production values are first rate. The problem is the incessant talking between performances. It breaks the continuity and ruins the show for me. The chatter should be at the end of the disc in the ""special features"" section. Just my opinion..."
5,So entertaining; such beautiful music,My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD. Chris Botti does an outstanding job. My absolute favorites are Emmanual featuring Lucia Micarelli and Cinema Paradiso with Yo-Yo Ma. All the performances were really good but these two where simply heavenly.
4,Chris Botti in Boston,A friend of mine had purchased it earlier and I had already seen it. The shipment of the product was fast. I would recommend this product.
5,Botti et al are amazing!,"If you're looking for a wonderful evening in, to relax and simply enjoy an amazing concert without the hassles of travel, tickets, getting a good seat, etc.,then this is for you. Can't say enough good things about this concert!"
5,Great performance!,"Beside excellent performance, Blu Ray transfer is top notch. Extra figure is more than I expected. Not sure why some grumbled about the extra figure. I particularly like the Fragile clip and the survived gentlemen humor. Amazon has great a+ service with fast shipping."
3,Great Concert but Not great Sound,"This Concert is full of talent and famous artists.Chris Botti is a great trompet performer.The Sound quality in 5.1 is not so good, and there is a lot of talking on the beginning of next music."
4,Best Botti so far...,"I enjoyed this blu ray more than Chris Botti's previous release (which is saying something!) and I highly recommend it. The song choices and the show overall just seems to work better to me. Beautifully filmed and edited, the only thing I don't like is one aspect of the sound. The audience clapping in time is channeled through to the surround speakers as expected, but it is a terrible cheap and tinny sound.... almost like a synthetic clapping sound with the treble turned up high. And it's too loud which tends to hurt the overall mix at times. Actually the soundscape is a bit too conservative / safe / thin / lacking dynamics for my taste..... but perhaps that style of mix better suits such a large stage full of musicians. However on balance, this is an absolutely excellent show with some very odd surprises (Steve Tyler??) that somehow just work really well. Great stuff indeed."
5,A good reason to buy a Blu-ray player.,"I love this disk! I heard part of it on PBS. I then rented the regular DVD from NetFlix and loved it. I decided to pay the premium and bought the Blu-Ray edition. This disc would be perfect as a demo disc in a high-end audio-video store. The music is fabulous. Chris's trumpet work is beautiful. His ensemble of players is first-rate and his guests are great. I have played this disk many, many times and each time is a treat. 'I've Got You Under My Skin' featuring Katharine McPhee made me fall in love. There are cuts that bliss me out, especially 'Cinema Paradiso' featuring Yo-Yo Ma. A spectacularly beautiful piece. Tears of joy run down my cheeks.The bonus Feature: ""Behind the Scenes - Chris Botti in Boston"" (40 min.) is also excellent.This disc is reason enough to buy a Blu-ray player. I am about to buy a copy for my brother and sister to share the joy"
4,Amazing..,"A present for my wife who adores not only many of the other songs & artists available to watch on this disc but is also a huge fan of Steven Tyler, as others have already rightly stated, this blu-Ray is worth the price just for the two Steven Tyler Songs alone, the one he sings to his Dad is very moving."
5,"Wow, real HD reference material, great lineup","Last night I opened the Chris Botti in Boston BD, and I have one word for this: WOW !Really, very good HD video, superb Dolby audio and an unmatched lineup that goes from Yo-Yo Ma to Katharine McPhee to Sting to Chris Botti himself.This is a definite reference Blu Ray disc to enjoy for years to come !"
3,inflatable waterslide repair...look no more!!!,We have had this slide for about 5 years now. My kids love it. The first year we put shaving cream on it...BIG MISTAKE! It severely dried it out and it seeped air and started falling down when they got on. I purchased a can of VLP (vinyl leather repair) and painted it on...worked really really super good. Plan on buying a few more cans more to keep around. They are playing on it right now. I have had no problems with blower. Fun toy!
3,Need an air blower motor,"My daughter and her friends were able to use this all last summer, although we've had to patch the stairs twice. This summer the motor got fried only on the second use. I've tried to contact the company to purchase a replacement but have gotten no response.If anyone has any ideas on where to get one it would be really helpful. KQ151@cox.net"
5,The definitive history of the Milwaukee Braves.,"This is the definitive history of baseball's most amazing and successful, if short-lived, franchise, lovingly and accurately portrayed by a native Milwaukee baseball historian/fan."
2,A Melodramatic Review of the Milwaukee Braves,"Mr. Buege is heavy on the facts in this detailed overview of the short life of the Milwaukee Braves. He is also heavy the cliches, mixed metaphors and melodrama. He'd be better off sticking with the facts.Today one cannot swing a cat in Milwaukee without striking someone who doesn't claim to have spent their formatives years watching baseballs sail towards Perrini's Woods. Had these romantics actually paid to see a few more games, the Braves would still be where Mr. Buege claims they belong.Mr. Buege ranks among those writers who use baseball as a metaphor to link generations, to conjure images of simpler times, of a more bucolic life, of the Federal Reserve Board, or whatever. The subject deserves better."
5,Use for Christams lights in Winter,I use this for hanging Christmas lights in our trees along with the WOLF Garden extendable handle. It works great and takes the hassle out of making sure the lights stay on the pole and go where I want them to. The ytree hookmakes a frustrating Christmas chore easier.
5,A Story of Redemption,I started the book thinking that it would be just another biography of a bad life turned good. By the end I was gripped by the reality of a miracle and reminded that God can indeed change anyone. I recommend the book to any person who thinks that anyone or any situation is hopeless. It is also a great tool for those that work with at risk youth.
1,beautiful BUT.......,i bought this a while ago. thrilled when i recieved it. simply beautiful. never got a chance to where it. then i did. five minutes into the evening the BUCKLE broke. terribly disappointed with the quality of the buckle. i had paid quite a bit for this shoe ....... not the price that it is going at now so expected a lot more from this shoe. i wish the manufactures pay a little attention to the clasps cos its not fun when your at a dance in four inches with one shoe off. HUMPH.....
1,Seriously lightened my hair,I followed the directions and left the product on my hair for an hour. I went from a dark brown/black to a ridiculous orange color. I couldn't believe how much this lightened my hair. I just wanted brighter red overtones.
5,Avalanche,I just recently purchased this album and have since been hooked. After hearing 'Weapon' on the Big Shiny Tunes 7 cd I could not wait until the release of this new Mathew Good album. My favourite tracks are: 1) pledge of allegiance 2)Weapon 3)double life 4)near fantastica 5)avalanche and 6)21st century living. If you enjoyed his previous music this album is much better in my opinion. Ive also enjoyed 'the audio of being'. Both are highly recommended buys. Being from Toronto Im constantly exposed to Canadian music and trust me Mathew Good is the BEST original artist of today. I hope his music becomes popular worldwide instead of just here in Canada. One of the best CDs in my extensive collection. BUY IT you won't regret it.
1,Same 'o' same 'o',"Right this album seems to be one continous song dragged over many tracks, his constant struggle to express his feelings is dragging his music backwards not forward. Listen to something good like John Legend."
5,5 Stars,Being an American fan of the MGB I was very pleased to hear that Matt was going solo with a new album...even though I did have to wait forever to get this import!! The wait was definitely worth it though. Once I popped the CD in the deck it has been on constant rotation. The orchestral music and Matts wavering voice completely suck you in. The long form songs are a pleasant distraction from the bubblegum pop and bad boy rap that have invaded the mainstream. Matt serves up an entire album of melodic introspective rock. Instantly addictive. ...!!!
5,Intelligent Musicianship,"I'll admit, I typically listen to music that's not too challenging...I prefer punk-pop stuff that's easy to sing along to. But after the first listen of Avalanche I knew I needed the album. MG is active in politics and knows a lot about world affairs, and this comes through in his music. One of my favorite songs is ""Pledge of Allegiance"" with the line ""It's okay to be their disappointment baby."" ""Lullaby"" is beautiful with strings and the appeal to use your voice. ""21st Century Living"" is the most in your face of them all, more of a spoken word challenge to open our eyes- the world's not about trampling over others and then tossing them a bone to make ourselves feel better. It's music with a message, at times the songs are almost a prayer, but no matter what it's MG's clear voice and intellegent lyrics."
5,Cerebral Candy,"Having been a Matthew Good fan for 8 years, I was very pleased with Avalanche. When I first listened to it, I diden't think I liked the album, but by the end of the day had taken about 5 full spins, and was singing all the words. Matt has the amazing ability to create amazing soundscapes with his music, and the lyrics that will catapult your mind to places only few songwriters are able, no song more evident than ""Near Fantastica"". Avalanche may not become the commercial success of ""Underdogs"" and ""Beautiful midnight"", but Matt has evolved into one of the most prolific songwriters of our time. This album is the best out right now, and everyone should take a listen, regardless of your musical taste"
5,Definately worth buying,"This album is excellent. The amazing singles ""Weapon"" and ""A world Called Catastrophe"" are probably enough reason to buy the album by themselves, but every one of the 13 tracks is strong enough to stand on its own. In particular i like ""While we were hunting rabbits"" However, this album is a lot mellower than anything previously released. That's not a bad thing, just don't be expecting any tracks like ""Carmelina"""
5,Truly awesome work,"I have always been a fan of the Matt good Bands work, and I didn't pay much attention to his solo release, I loved the song weapon, but I never picked up the album....so maybe a year after its realeased after getting minimal attention here in Canada I decided to buy it and give it a listen.....Wow....I was stuck in my seat listening for 3 days....this is Matt Goods best work done yet....truly outstanding...what a CD, from top to bottom its stellar, and it has some tracks that will just blow you away.....Bright End of Nowhere, Pledge of Allegience, House of Smoke and Mirrors, Lullaby for the New World, Avalanche, Song for the Girl not to mention his video released songs Weapon and In World Called Catastrophe...all killer tracks, my personal favourite, and one of the best songs I've ever heard is While we were hunting Rabbits.....what a song....its so powerful towards the end you can't even move....all I can say is buy this CD!!"
2,Moves the air but makes jerky nose that disturbs all in house,"ARGUH ! I have to get up at night to turn this fan down to low just to sleep. it sounds like a car engine trying to turn and it is getting worse. It was fine for the first week, then slowly it rattles more and more ?!?!??! I have a ten year old box fan that is more quite. I really wanted this fan, it does move the air incredibility, but something has been poorly put together in the manufacturing. I am returning it after only three weeks."
4,Not as quiet as I hoped it would be,"From the description I hoped this Vornado would be more quiet, therefore I give it only 4 stars. We use it in our living room downstairs, since our 2 story townhouse heats quite uneven. It get upstairs quite warm, while the living & kitchen downstairs remained quite cold. This fan helps mixing the lower and upper air very well, so now the temperature in our townhouse upstairs and downstairs are within 1C. The sound at the lowest speed setting is just acceptable. But I have to say it gets the job done at that speed. We use it pointing straight up. The black fan looks quite nice and blends in with our living room furniture. It arrived from this seller well packaged and quite quick, and it was the best price I could find."
3,A little noisy,"I'm using this fan because I think it will reduct the electricity cost. I just started to use so no result yet.It says whisper quiet, but it is a quite noisy even lowest speed position. I cannot keep ON during sleep."
2,Generic and boring,"I found the stories in this book to be forgettable and bland. I read Asimov a lot and this stories do not come even near the quality of his writing. I can't believe they were put in an awards showcase. Some of them are good, but mostly are so so."
3,Workbook Review,"Signed up for an Intro to Statistics class and was so anxious that I purchased this workbook as a supplement. I did not find the book helpful at all. The few occasions I tried to find relevant problems to assist my understanding of the class topics were disappointing. I did get an A in the class, but it was not because of any help gleaned from the book."
3,Good practice,I brought this because of the reviews it got but it did not help me in my class. Problems were too easy. None of it was covered in my class.
5,Lots of helpful information for exams,"This book helped me get ready for my exams. There were tons of problems, with answers all worked out and explained clearly. Plus it gives you a lot of ideas about what your teacher might ask you on an exam. I found this to be very helpful in my stats class."
4,Adie tones it down,"After listening to The Benjamin Gate's techno pop-rock sound I was surprised at how much Adie has matured since leaving the band. I purchased this album specifically for the song ""When It's Over"" and have really come to love the rest of the songs as well. However, I thought she could have taken some more risks musically. The songs, although very good, tend to all kind of run together. Again, everything is good but nothing really stands out as exceptional.Nevertheless, I eagerly anticipate her next album and am hoping to see her be a little more creative."
5,Beautiful Voice and Great Lyrics.,"The former lead singer of now disbanded Benjamin gate returns with her solo debut. Adie has such a beautiful voice and you cant help but love the vocals on this CD. The lyrics are so powerful and just draw you closer to God. The standout songs are ""Your Way"" ""When Its Over"" and her cover of the Byrds song ""Turn Turn Turn."" I also Like ""Dont Wait(Lazy Days) it is just a fun song to sing along with."
5,Excellent Book,"I almost did not buy the book because Dr. Frances Dawson was not visible as the author, only Bowler. This information written in a different time is still applicable today. Many employers should educate themselves to less modern advice for employees when employees were happier, more productive, loyal, possessed a work ethic, and were rarely absent."
1,Poor drivers...,Stay away from this product and m-audio in general. These guys have terrible driver support and there are no Vista drivers for any of their products currently. (Sad considering how long Vista has been in development.)
2,Good sound bu unreliable,"I was excited to get this high-end, well reviewed PCI audio interface. No problems installing on my Windows XP system, the system worked well with my DAW software, sound quality was good.After a while, though, the output went bad. After a web search, I found it was most likely a bad capacitor. Took it to a repair shop and, sure enough, there was a bad capacitor. The guy told me they were cheap capacitors. For not much more money they could have put in much better. While he had it open, I told him to replace all the capacitors with better ones -- the parts weren't expensive.Recently, the output has crapped out again -- only getting the left channel. I don't know what the problem is and can't fix it. Looking for a new card. I don't think I'll be using M-Audio."
5,This has been a very reliable card,"I have had trouble with so many other sound cards for DAW recording, but this card has always been there for me. It is very clean and has never been difficult to set up through numerous computer upgrades. In fact, it is the only piece of equipment that I started with and still use. I plan to buy a second Delta 1010 for my system for more tracks. A very clean setup and very reliable."
1,"Nice hardware, terrible drivers","I've owned the Delta 1010 for quite some time now and it basically boils down to this: Great hardware, terrible drivers. The XP drivers are missing some functionality that just about every other sound card supports (volume adjustment via IntelliType to name one example) and have a few other small issues. M-Audio also lacks Vista support of any kind, good luck finding so much as a beta driver. If you are looking to put this hardware in your Vista system then you will be severely disappointed when it fails to function. It will no doubt be many months before the first Vista drivers start showing up and they will more than likely be unstable (as they were when the original XP drivers came out some years ago)."
1,No Vista Driver,"Hi, this soundcard perform well in windows xp , but m-audio do not provide any Vista driver , and there no plan to release it."
1,M AUDIO IS SOSO,I had another product from m audio called fire wire solo VERY PROBLEMATIC 0 Z E R O RELIABILITY bad drivers a lot of failures .Planning to buy delta 1010 with a lot of mistrust but it is the only one brand besides degidesign that works with pro tools BAD FOR ME/As the first review person said STAY AWAY FROM M audio!!!! if possible.
5,A bitter-sweet gem!,"My husband and I -- both 50+ years old -- absolutely adored this movie. We laughed and cried and laughed again. I am on Amazon at this moment to buy a copy or two: one to keep, and one to give to a lucky person."
4,A Very High Four Stars!,"The movie is so wonderful because of the theme it is trying to get across. I think the movie is trying to show how people can break down their defenses and connect. It shows this happening between the young and the old. It is done in an amusing yet sadly touching way. I haven't seen this theme played on and find it to be highly original. This film touches on how to forgive and let go, learning to be intimate and accepting others as they are. I throughly enjoyed the acting and the direction. Lahti knows how to show rich colors with creativity. I really loved J's bedroom and her manner of dress. The only flaw was the movie went to fast, it had to many things to say and might have been better not as cluttered, a bit simpler. I just felt like the ending went too fast as compared to the slower pace of the beginning which was nicely paced as it developed J's relationship to R. Overall, a must see! I might compare it a little to You Can Count On Me. (***)"
4,A Very Pleasant Surprise,"When I first rented this movie from the library a while ago, I hadn't heard anything at all about it. I guess I rented it just out of curiosity to see how it compared to all the other Woody Allen-esque excuses for borderline jailbait romances I assumed it would be just based on the cover. Boy was I in for a pleasant surprise! This turned out to be one of the most riveting and enjoyable movies I've seen in years. It is complex yet immediately comprehendible to the higher emotions, which is just what it needs to be considering what happens. If Christine Lahti didn't win any awards for her excellent direction she should have. Highly recommended!"
5,I just watched this twice. I will watch it again!,"I always like Leelee Sobieiski. In this she was perfection. Albert Brooks is always okay but I loved him in this. Carol Kane, Mary Kay Place, Michael McKean and John Goodman were the throw away characters. They all are wonderful in their parts but the movie is really alive when Leelee and Albert are on screen together. Great humour, great pathos, great sexual tension but no sex. What is it about? People. Think a Ghost World in which everyone is actually so much better off for having met. If you need a come on line how about this: ""Is there a bathroom in this place or do you just go right on the floor."""
4,A different kind of movie...,"I rented this movie hoping to laugh [a lot], well it does have Albert Brooks in it, but I got much more in return. This movie delivers at so many levels that it doesn't really fit in any genre. You'll laugh and you'll cry, at the same time! Both Sobieski and Brooks deliver solid performances, backed up with a great cast. I heard someone compare it to Ghost World, and believe me, it is way better than Ghost World. Hell, I didn't even laugh in Ghost World... and this one has a real message.This movie really deserved a 5, but since the disc is bare bones it takes the rating back one star."
4,Worth the time and money,Others have already detailed this film better than I but I enjoyed the rental and am purchasing the DVD. If you like Albert Brooks then this is one of his best.
1,"Terrible, audience-alienating title .....................","There is a lot to like about this movie, but much more not to like. It demonstrates why good acting is so important. The script is intellectual and untruthful, yet the actors turn it into a watchable film.The pretentious title, which emerges from the final eulogy, is a box office killer. It is mystifying before you see the movie, and almost as mystifying afterwards.The actors are so good that you want to like what you're seeing, but there is no logic. A daughter this troubled does not result from parents this untroubling. The friendship between R and J is made believable, but the backstory is not. So you enjoy its progression, but while not knowing any reason J is like she is, the story ultimately feels hollow and contrived."
2,Unimaginative,I sat through this movie hoping it would get better. Unfortunately it got worse and the ending is classic Hollywood confectionary. Brooks is good as usual but Sobieski is completely miscast and is too pretty to really pull off the alienated teen she is supposed to portray. I would recommend seeing Ghost World which deals with exactly the same subject matter and is much more touching and realistic.
2,Contrived and conformist in the end; but nice performances,"The first two-thirds is very good (4 stars): story, characters, visual presentation and effects. Then gag, the whole thing becomes atrociously contrived and dishonest, insulting and irritating with its ""heart-warming"" conformist message. Sobieski is very very good though, the rest of the cast nice as well. Worth seeing once, or maybe just two-thirds."
2,It seems to lack detail,"The book seems to ramble back and forth in time and little is tied down. People are listed (Calabi & Yao - Yang & Mills and so on) But I have no idea of what they really added to SMT. No equations are given. It theories failed, IO have no idea why."
2,A superficial view of a multi-dimensional world,"After reading Brian Green's ""The Elegant Universe"", I wanted to learn more on the possibility of a world made of more than 4 dimensions, time included. L. Krauss seemed to offer the opportunity not only to learn more about these extra dimensions based on scientific knowledge but also to melt it with an insightful adventure into the history of human creativity which has already imagined such world. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. Both the scientific and artistic parts are poor and shallow, a shame when the explanation of a multidimension world is at stake. The rhetoric has nothing of the passion and the doors-opening of Brian Green's book. Too bad."
4,PRACTICAL SCHOOL BASED INTERVENTION GUIDE,"THIS BOOK DESCRIBED IN DETAIL THE FAMILY IMPLICATIONS OF DIVORCE, CHILDREN WITH LEARNING DISABILITIES AND THE IMPACT OF POVERTY. BY DESCRIBING THESE FAMILIES IN DEPTH, FOLLOWUP INTERVENTIONS BECOME OBVIOUS. WELL WORTH YOUR MONEY IF YOU ARE A SPECIAL ED TEACHER OR SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST."
1,Unacceptable printing.,"I am returning this item because the printing is unacceptably poor. The book is softbound and yet the pages appear to be photocopies, and not good ones. The syntax definitions (the most important part, for me), are in gray-on-gray box text that, in this printing, is almost unreadable."
1,DON'T BUY (duplicate..not original),"I looked around in class, and every body had small compact, smooth, and colored books.(same material). Am the only one who had this bulky, black&white, big boring book. This is not the original book, its just printed sheets which make it too big & heavy to handle. It looks so funny, i don't know why 2 people gave a 5-star. I should have 1st read the one-star reviews before i bought it. But I was too late........"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!,"This is an absolutely terrible CD! In fact, of all the CDs I've ever listened to with good expectations (I can't count the ones I've heard against my will in friends' cars), this is the WORST compact disc ever! There are not 76 complete songs as the track listing says (amazon.com's track listings get flustered when it comes to medleys), but rather nine or ten medleys to different bandleaders (but Glenn Miller got two) comprised of about six to ten songs each. Each medley is god-awful; they all have this terrible synthesized heavy pop/r&b/rap beat behind them that sounds like one of those bad rhythms from an expensive keyboard. I believe, also, that the music itself is synthesized too. Aside from a good (but very short, since it's in a medley) excerpt of Charlie Barnet's ""Skyliner,"" also marred by that dreadful beat, this is grade-Z stuff. Avoid throwing your money on this piece of trash, for if you don't you'll wish you had."
4,brings back memories,"I bought this since I was born in Liverpool and lived there for several years. My parents lived there during the war. I enjoyed seeing most of the video - it brought back a lot of memories, some good, some not so good. What disappointed me was the several instances of profanity, which in my opinion, did not add anything. Unfortunately, I did not show this to my mom (in her 80s) since that language does not sit well with her. Other than that, it was interesting, and anyone who spent time in Liverpool would appreciate the many years of history on one DVD."
5,From a Biased Fan,"I am biased because I love the films of Terence Davies, even as I realize they are not for everyone. That is the point, really: his work is a direct reflection of his sensibility, and you either see that and identify with it or you don't. The reviewers who complain that this is not an objective, by-the-book documentary are missing the point entirely. As Davies explains in one of the interviews, this is a personal work that developed in its own time and fashion. It does not rely on chronology or any standard organizing principle. For that reason Davies and the rest of the filmmaking team refer to the film as more of a poem, and so it is."
1,Scousers BEWARE,"As a native son, I would need therapy and Prozac after seeing this depressing review of one of the great English cities. No mention of the firsts; first RSPCA, first community health nurse, first public library, first public transport, first under river tunnel for vehicle traffic, and dozens of others. A morbid self loathing picture of a failed Catholic Heterophobic, anti-social bigot."
1,shoot me now!,"Given Liverpool has given us the Beatles, Echo & the Bunnymen and Liverpool FC (apologies to Gerry & the Pacemakers, Wah Heat and Everton FC), this is as dreadfully dull a ""fillum"" as those three icons of Liverpool are endlessly fascinating.Right from the start this thing moves soooooo slow it's painful to watch. I get it; it's a social commentary, but the narrator's voice and the glacial pace of this dreck had me hitting the fast-forward button.I don't have the patience to go through the DVD extras so I'll leave that to someone else.Basically, remember those hideous documentaries you had to sit through in high school social studies classes, this flick is just like that. For me, I'll stick with my Bunnymen DVD and Liverpool FC '80s highlight video. Ian McCulloch and Ian Rush to me are Liverpool not this."
1,Easily one of the worst films I have ever seen,"Surely, this is the ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" of documentaries. It is poorly made, unsympathetic and boring. The narrator is entirely self-focused and his voice is unsuited to narrative, raspy and irritating. The footage is monotonous, depressing, and actually manages to say very little about the city. The film is used as a personal vehicle for a few views that are entirely irrelevant to the subject. People viewing this lame pastiche who actually came from the city and from that time felt personally insulted. I'm sure the supporting organizations, who thought they were aiding in a true representation of their city, would be justified in legal action for misrepresentation. This was truly horrid and grating, no redeeming qualiteis except that it opens the way for someone to do a really good film on what is actually the always interesting and always dynamic city of Liverpool."
2,Caution,I was told by a customer that pages fell out of brand new copy o0f this book; perhas publisher was having abad glue day.
4,Tabu Cologne,I was very satisfied with this product even though it wasn't quite like the one I have been using.the service was fantastic and I am pleased with Amazon as they are great to do busiiness with and always keep you well informed.
4,Tabu by Dana,"Excellent Service. One of my favorite perfumes, an oldie but very good. Just give it a try, men like this scent, Thanks. Marion"
2,"Nice drawings, pity about the detail!","Much of the content of this title is spoilt by a very heavy reliance on materials such as ""car body filler"", which should have almost nothing to do with restoration other than for motor vehicles! It seems to me that those involved with it's writing/publication must have shares in manufacturers of same, (or am I just going too far there?!) The diagrams are excellent, clear and direct, but I do shudder at some of the advice and content. Where has the soul gone in restoration if our first turn is to a synthetic filler rather that a sympathetic, honest to goodness timber repair/restoration."
4,Makings of a supergroup,"This the official Lynyrd Skynyrd 1st album shows just how good they were even at the very beginning. Songs later polished on ""Pronounced"" are offered in their bare state, but are they not just as good? Some are even better! Freebird with piano intro is more bareand stark and soul searching, Simple Man is only 2 guitars not 3and still rocks,etc.and let's not talk about Ricky Medlocke's vocals.They're absolutely brilliant, if he had stayed with the band Ronnie might have had a run for his money on vocals, or Lynyrd could have possibly moved into another musical territory alltogether and been more mellow.However this is an excellent introduction to a band that still rocks today albeit a few members less.True professionality is shown from note one to the last and that is why Lynyrd Skynrd are still with uss today. Yeee......Haw"
5,Great album!,"Recommended for everybody who has an interest in the beginning of a great band. Sounds great, too."
5,cd-heaven's got a point...,"Cd-Heaven stands corrected. If you really wanted to, you could do like we did in the old days and put down your own mix of songs on tape, I.E. put down this record on tape and add the missing two from best of the rest. And if you're really lucky and have an 8-track recorder (like me) then you can really play around with it, though you wouldn't have the room for many of the songs. Some activities (like doing mixtapes) never go out of style. Only problem is being able to find decent blanks anymore."
1,I'm not happy with this deal,One of the microphones arrived spoiled. It doesn't run well.It was not a good deal through Amazon web site.
4,Good Basic Microphones for the Price,"I bought these microphones for preteen students to use. I don't trust such users to be careful with microphones, so the cheapest usable microphones are the best bet. They are a bit susceptible to picking up small sounds from being handled, though they have good sound quality. I was surprised at how well they held up to rough handling."
5,Great deal for $30,I bought these mics about two weeks ago got them home and they work great. Especially for $30. They don't come with any cables so make sure you have Mic cables but the Mic's are very sturdy well built and I think they are a steal for the price I got them for. 5 Stars !!
4,Really not bad for the price.,"I run a local channel in Kansas and we just started recording city council meetings. We purchased two of these for a total of six microphones. The price is unbelievably good for such solid microphones. We have used them with a Behringer 12 channel mixer and the audio is fairly decent. There is a pretty consistent hum/hiss in the background, but that can usually be removed in post. I have found that the mic needs to be pointed slightly above or below mouth level in order to pic up audio well. The polar pattern for these definitely picks up better on the edges (slightly off center). I would recommend these to anyone with a low budget who doesn't mind background noise. We purchased mic stands that came with mic holders so I have not used the ones included in this package, so I cannot say anything about them."
3,Bien,"El producto viene en perfecto estado con todos los componentes descritos, sin embargo la calidad de sonido no es la que espera. Uno de los incovenientes de comprar en internet es no poder probarles antes de adquirirlos, Por lo demas no tengo ningun comentario"
5,classic instruction,"In this hyped and frenetic world, this black and white remains a classic. It is a wonder it is still available, and belongs on the shelf of every serious student of the game.You can see every principle of the modern one plane golf swing exemplified in the moves of Sam when no one knew what these principles were. Sam knew but he'd never let you in on the real secrets of the game. He would affect his hillbilly demeanor and declare that when he wanted to hit a fade-""Ah'd just feel a fade."" Doubtless he played by feel but the pictures prove he knew what he was doing, even if intuitively, and knew he had the edge over almost everyone but his nemesis Hogan, who dug it out of the dirt himself in a different way.If you don't have this classic by some miracle it's available for however long no one knows-get it today."
3,No actual discussion of the content of the bible,"What is here isn't bad. But when I look for an introduction to the bible I am looking for an understanding of 3 things 1) how it was written and the cannon established (does good with this), 2) how it has been understood over time (it is ok, but not great with this) and 3) what is in the bible. What is in the bible is completely absent from this introduction.If you have a short book, then I would not include a section on politics or gender or various heresies before I talked about what was actually in the bible."
2,Not useful,"This is a really thin book, not at all the thick teacher's addition and answers to the textbook that I expected. Not worth the purchase."
4,great hammock,"this is a nice hammock, its soft and warm and snuggly, the older ferrets luv it, it hugs there body so they feel safe and warm. yes i would recommend it to anyone who has older ferrets or ferrets who like to snuggle...."
1,wrong product did not match the picture on the site.,The picture on this site is like the hammock that I need to replace. When I got it it was not the one that I thought it was. It will cost more to ship it back than I paid for the product originally.
3,To big!,"This hammock was to big for the cage, it hit the floor.. I guess it's for a cage with a lot of extra space but it expands almost 3 ft in length. My ferret would sleep under it rather in it so I took it out."
5,My kind of music,"I like music that soothes my soul and this cd, Summer Dream by Sweet People, does just that. It is calming and relaxing music, it makes me feel glad!!"
4,Outstanding!!!!!!,This is a beautiful CD. Particularly the Lake Como track. I heard this music played by a local D. J. and have been trying to coordinate the playing with my recording to no avail but thanks to Amazon I can now do it at my leisure. You won't be sorry by buying this CD. It is great!!!
1,more boring than stalled traffic,"Wow. I've enjoyed other Pearson books when I'm looking for a quick read, but this book was painful to finish. It seems at times to be parody of the international spy novel -- the character, dialoge and story lines are so cliche I found myself laughing out loud at times. I resorted to keeping this in my car to read only when stalled in traffic -- even then, sometimes the traffic was more interesting. Avoid this one."
1,couldn't finish,"normally love Pearson ... his books are taut -- good characters -- _realistic_ characters ... but not this time ... everyone in the US gov't is a brilliant patrician ... suave ... handsome .. cool ... and, oh yes, independently wealthy too! come on! not one likable character ... even the villain was one-dimensional ... tossed it after reading just a third of it -- even that was too much! ... not worth the effort -- quite annoying ..."
1,"SHOULD NOT HAVE READ ""NEVER LOOK BACK""","This was a really waste of time for me. I have read all of the Lou Boldt series so I thought anything by Ridley Person would be good, boy, was I wrong. There were many, many boring pages, to much description of what I think was going on. So much was really unbelieveable. Clayton or what ever his code name is at the present time, is a superman, cannot be killed no matter what. Just an all around bad book for me. I did read it all thinking it had to get better, but it did not. Read something you know you like or some of the Lou Boldt books and leave this one alone."
2,Never Look Back,"I have had no previous experience with any of Ridley Pearson's writings and maybe my mistake was in reading ""Never Look Back"" as a starter rather than as a finisher. I'm unable to compare this to any of his eight prior writings and seriously question whether I will bother to read any of them, but I won't say that positively.I found the writing to be rather far-fetched and not too believable...maybe not even understandable. Some of the situations were totally unbelievable and bordered on the ridiculous. This writing is not rated highly by me, somewhat of a loser, actually. Sorry to be so negative.E.J. Walden, author of ""Operation Snow Owl"""
5,Developing Effective Research Proposals,"The product was just as described, arrived in expected time, and the price was fair. I will purchase from this vendor again."
3,"Supplies for Confederate Army , how they were obtained",Shows how more than just North and South involvment in war; but the rest of Europe 's interacaction and some of the players
4,Turner - Melamine - Red,Turner is very bright true red. Medium width. I am happy with it. The shipping was very fast also.
3,Nothing Special,"There were multiple occasions while listening to this concert when I found myself daydreaming, and completely disengaged from the show. I'm a Sinatra fanatic who usually finds positives out of every piece of his work I listen to, but I wasn't exactly blown away by this performance. I gave it three stars because it's Sinatra, and there's no such thing as bad Sinatra. But if you're looking for stellar live Sinatra concerts, you're better off going after Sinatra At The Sands. I only recommend this to collectors looking to own all of Frank's work."
4,I'd buy it for one song,"Sinatra was over 70 when this was recorded, and his best work was years behind him, but I've never heard him swing as he does on ""Mack the Knife"". Literally- the album is worth buying for one song."
2,Live from Las Vegas-Sinatra,"Poor sound quality, not professionally prepared. Some bits and pieces of a Sinatra live performance but hardly worth listening to unless you're a die-hard fan that cannot get enough of Sinatra."
2,Be careful with the size,I normally wear a Medium and I ordered an XL. Because the site recommended to order two sizes larger then your size. Well I received the rash guard and it was still to small. I purchased a boys XL some where else and that fit me. So be very careful on the size you order.
1,More harm than good,"Figueroa begins the preface to his dictionary by saying that there was a need for a dictionary of legal terms in Spanish and English since none were recently published. (His dictionary was copyrighted in 2004.) However, there were at least 25 such dictionaries published between 1990 and 2004. This narrow view is indicative of what's inside of his dictionary: it is mostly a glossary with only a few cursory definitions sprinkled throughout and the translated terms that are offered are not very good. This dictionary seems more like a first draft rather than a published work. Stay away from this one. If you want a good English-Spanish law dictionary go with any of the following authors: Cabanellas de las Cuevas/Hoague, Becerra, Alcaraz-Varó/Hughes, Antonio Ramírez or Mazzucco/Maranghello."
5,Great toy!!,"We just gave this to my 2 year old for his birthday. What a hit!! Both he and his 6 year old brother love it! It's durable, fun, easy to learn how to use. When the 2 year old heard the siren and watched his car go down the ladder ramp and in to the storage under the hat - he squealed and jumped with delight! Well worth the money!"
4,"Solid, and Works the Way it Should","Holds lots of cars, make's cool noises, you can steer it using the ladder, but very light and easy to move. Cars use ladder as speed jump into hat. Hat is a bit cheesy, but the Toddler loves the whole thing. A touch pricey, but built well for the money, got it at Costco"
4,Steer N Store Firetruck,My grandson loves it and will get many hours of enjoyment from playing with it.
5,One Of The Few Books Which Is Right On Target,"In this book, Pastor Ryken offers basic principles for interpreting and applying God's law and explain these holy words... commandment by commandment, illustrating each with biblical account and relating each to the person and redemptive work of Jesus Christ. This book should be read along with your bible and savored with reflection. I could hardly put the book down...from the first page to the end. Gods holiness and his standards for life are clearly related, and the joy of living by Gods law is vividly portrayed. His explanation on the The Ten Commandment open my eyes up to the deep meaning of the law. Readers will find themselves examining their own lives, changing their ways, and delighting in the grace of God.This book is, Highly Recommended. Great Commentary for any home library. One book you will want to come back to so that you can refresh your memory. My next book and my suggestion to you will be Ryken's The Communion of SaintsTripp"
3,He liked it!,I bought this book for my father-in-law and he seemed to be very excited to start solving some puzzles. I didn't personaly try any. I loved the binding (how you can flip the pages behind one another). The laminated front cover was nice too.
2,No more 16 horsepower.,"The creepy youthful energy of the first three 16 horsepower cds is what I'll always remember Edwards for. His new stuff is slow, somber and depressing. I just wish he'd go back to his old school, redneck, banjo plucking, chicken clucking, wisky swigging, porch dwelling, Bible thumping, white trash, roots. That stuff was fun to listen to and sing along with."
4,Kool G. Rap is still R-A-W on the mic,"This is a very hot album. This album is solid all around. From the first cut you see that G. Rap is still the illest when it comes to reality rap. He originated reality rap and he hasn't lost a step. My favorite cut is ""A Thug's Love Story."" Each verse has a different beat. And G. Rap exquisitely paints a story of how he falls in love with a lady but then he and his new honey is chased by her man and her man's goons. Verse two and three of this song is action packed. Hearing G. Rap spit the story is like watching an action flick. On that note Kool G. Rap is a living legend in the Hip Hop game."
5,Cannon Fire,Kool G Rap will give you what he's famous for and thats rapid fire rhymes mixed into some storytellin'. For any fan of Hip hop I highly recommend it!
3,"Lyrically nice, but pretty samey",Basically this album doesn't offer anything different to all Kool G Rap's other work...thug/Mafia/killa type ish. However he does tell some nice stories on here and since the last album managed to develop an interesting skill of carrying on the same rhyme through upwards of six bars(indeed on Cannon Fire the verses are basically the same rhyme all the way through). But the album needed better production and variety to be great.
5,"Excellent Book! My kids LOVE it, and so do I!","This book brings to life the way children see things - their imaginations dance! Every wonder why your 3-5 yr. old doesn't hear you when you are talking with them? Here's why...they are enjoying their wonderful imagination. This book shows how vivid kids can be in their thoughts - how things can magically turn into something different with just a twist of interpretation.I loved this book because it brings back all those memories when I just stood back and watched my kids play. How we'd all love to capture those moments or make time stand still. Those, I wish this could last forever...moments.I can't wait for the next book from this author! I found www.booksbydana.com has a listing of more books to come."
2,Poor writing,"This book seems like a scholar investigation. Very poor writing, it did not attract my interest. The only thing that is worth reading, are 2 or 3 interesting comments from some CEO`s."
2,Something interesting (and it's not the book)...,Most of the glowing reviews of this book were written by people who have written only one review - and that is for this book. What is even more interesting is that these glowing reviews all sound like they came from the same pen. Doesn't pass the smell test to me.Sit down with the book for a few minutes before you buy it and decide for yourself.
4,Nobodies to Somebodies,This book has valuable information for ambitious young people. It can help them relax because it shows that there is no one way to success. It can help them relax if they are worried because it shows that the most succesful people were worried when in their twenties. It can help them work intelligently because it shows that the important thing in early jobs is to learn everything one can especially the fundamentals. Also one should try to ask as many probing questions as one can- sometimes silently and sometimes to others. The book can also help teachers and counselors because it tells them things to tell young people who are about to leave school and enter the work force.
5,It's all about Learning Agility,"This is a great modern day version of some trailblazing research conducted two decades ago at the Center for Creative Leadership documented in the Lessons of Experience. Peter not only captures interesting stories and lessons behind 100 successful people, but he also breaks them down into some commonalities and critical lessons. At the core of it all is successful people are learning agile - meaning they adapt to change and handle first time experiences better than others and also glean lessons from those experiences. They are self aware and open to continuous development. This is a great book for Human Resources practitioners, people interested in a good leadership read and/or parents who want to inspire their college age kids."
5,Bravo,"Roy Glenn has crafted an excellent tale of suspense and street drama interwoven with a love story.Will love conquer all or will the motto of the crew ( Money over Bi***es) be the law of the day ? You must read MOB to find out.If you read Mr. Glenn's previous novel , Is It A Crime, you can see his growth as a writer. I am anxiously awaiting his next release in April."
5,Wonderful,"This book was great. I loved the way that you kept the 3 friends together (Travis, Jackie, & Ronnie). Jackie was just like one of the guys she had it going on. She didn't take any mess. I was dissapointed that Mike Black wasn't in this book but you made up for it in Drug Related. I read this book in a few days. Anyone that has not read this book must go out and buy it today. Keep writing... We are waiting on you to come to Birmingham to do a book signing and reading!!!!"
3,Powerful Message,"This play started out draging, it picks up in spots and becomes interesting, and drags again. I liked this play, but it would be better if all of the sequences were in order.It had a good message but it took so many turns to get there!"
1,"Just blue marbles -- no ""earth"" pattern","Contrary to the picture, these do NOT have any discernable ""earth"" pattern -- they're just plain mottled blue marbles. Pretty enough in their own way perhaps, but don't get them thinking they'll look like the globe!"
2,mottled blue marbles,These do not have any kind of earth design on them. Just mottled blue marbles.Perhaps ok for the price but not as expected
3,"I'm torn, but I give it a 3...","...and three stars is pushing it. I gave it three because it exists, and not much else does that tried to cover a comprehensive history of cars. However, it falls short. Firstly, the episodes are a half hour, if that. Modern variations of some cars, like AMG Mercedes, are shown in brief snips, but not covered. Finally, if you are a big enough car nut to rent a disc like this, you want the intricate details of each product line (for instance, specific engine types or limited run racing versions of a Corvette), and they really just skim. I commend them for trying, but dont go into this rental thinking you are going to learn much."
4,Good Videos For The Car Enthusiast,The only problem is that the Videos are too short! An auto enthusiast will want to see them all. They are an excellent summary of he Cars and Auto companies they are about. They are very enjoyable.
3,"Very informative, but not overtly exciting","Great history. I was hoping the series would focus more on the cars themselves, rather than on the historical background and the manufacturers of the cars. Rarely do they even play recordings of the cars' exhaust notes.I would say that this set is worth the purchase. But just know that this is no Top Gear or Fifth Gear. This is a historical documentary."
5,Skeleton Lode,"I thought the book had a very good tale. At verious spots in this book one might think that they have it figgured out, all of the sudden another twist pops up, and you are off again. The two mex guides keep you guessing where and when they will pop up, and with who. You have a laid back sheriff, helpfull town folk, many bad guys, good guys ect... What I thought was the clincher was DAVIS, who would of thought he would come out of the caves? more or less the way he did. Then the ending, wow. I have read all but three of the books listed on this site, and I think this one was by far the best. Not to say I did not like the others, I still do."
4,Amazing!,"When I saw it I was a bit leery. However, it works beautifully. Pumping up the chambers is a bit tiresome and will take a while. I needed another person to help test the bed after letting out air. Definitely worth the price."
1,Didn't work for me,"This product did not fix the situation, despite numerous attempts and configurations.I can see how it might help some but for me, with a king size mattress and a couple of dips, it was unable to fix things and actually made them worse.I felt happier to just remove the item altogether and live with it until I get another mattress."
5,"Positively riveting, a must-own for any furry fan...","This is one of those books that draws you in piece by piece, until you're sitting up at the wee hours of the morning, saying 'One more page, one more page...' Absolutely adorable characters, very believeable plotline as well. A story I'll read again and again. Be warned, though: there is a fair bit of violence and suggestive themes. Nothing compared to what one would find on prime-time TV, but don't expect a kiddie, toned-down Arabian Nights setting; it's all presented just as it would be. All in all, a sheer blast to read, and an A+ to Mr. Kidd."
4,"Srsly, people...",...this is good stuff. Chock full of soul. If you don't like it your name is probably Brad or something.
5,Finally...,"I searched online for hours trying to find the perfect workout DVDs... and I found this one! I was VERY skeptical about paying $60 for this product, but I decided to give it a try after reading the reviews. This was the best $60 I've spent in a while!! I highly recommend this package for anybody who is looking for getting into regular workouts (they do have modified exercises for beginners) or who is looking for a new challenge. This is a GREAT buy!"
5,One of the best Ansel Adams books,"This is one of the best Ansel Adams books out there published by Bulfinch. It uses heavy paper stock and the print quality is excellent. To appreciate its quality, you have to view it under a brighter light setting, preferrably next to a window. You'll notice all the details in the shadow area and appreciate the overall print contrast.In terms of subject area, the book covers many National Parks, including Yosemite, Yellowstone, Joshua Tree, Grand Teton, Grand Canyon, Glacier... Unfortunately, it does not have all the famous Yosemite prints, but it does have many other gems that's not over exposed to the public.Some people may complain about the price, buy I think its worth every dime. Buy one and enjoy it."
3,Franco Battiaco - 'Clic' (Artis Records) 3 1/2 stars,"Originally released in 1974, until just recently, I've never even remotely heard of this Italian musician, composer, artist, etc. A friend lent me this disc. Best described as electronic / experimental pop. Tunes here that somewhat impressed me were the inventive ""No U Turn"", ""Propiedad Prohibida"" {featuring some good electronic sounds in the background} and ""Ethika Fon Ethica"" which appears to be like a sound compilation of commercials, radio advertisements,etc. - quite novel, really. Might appeal to fans of Terry Riley, Brian Eno, Manuel Gottsching and Vangelis."
5,A true follower of the Way,"this is the best book I have ever read on a missionary. Actually her story would awe anyone - easy to read and understand, encouraging in that she tells you all her faults which are just like ours, and God used her mightly.You will learn and rejoice with her in the telling of her story.Blessings included:)"
5,Great book,Corrie Ten Boom is one of my favorite authors. She radiates Jesus. This book contains three books in one. A must read.
4,For the couch potato candidate.,"You will find out standard methods of using the internetto run a campaign, but it won't get you elected. I boughtseveral of these books as I am a precint person. I foundno help at all from this book, and it had nearly the sameadvice the other two had. Read it, but not much help.A sucessful candidate is one face to face talker."
3,Good if you like Halloween...,"This lightsaber is not for you if you like to have hard-fought play battles. It will bend easily if you fight with it. If you want a durable fighting lightsaber, get the normal ones."
4,ok but bends easily,the only reason i gave it four stars is because it is fun once iwas fighting and it bent in half other than that it is good
1,Insipid,"A three-horned monster babysits his/her infant sibling who won't stop crying. To restore some peace, Monster builds block towers and only when s/he knocks the tower over does Baby laugh. A bare bones story that has no plot - baby cries - Monster builds - Monster knocks tower over - all smiles for both. Trite."
2,EXPENSIVE - LOADS of WHITE Paper!,"I just downloaded the book from the BookLocker in PDF version paid [$], my friend recommended me this book, trust me if u googleup, then u can noticed the several cool articles and then compile them and u will have Wireless Profits, in your hand. I won't recommend anyone to buy this product. Oh yes! there is one more , after every 5-10 pages you will see the ""Blank"" pages, and then it is not actually 136 Pages, it has five blank pages in the end. If Amazon.com wanna verify it they should download the PDF too and then see by themselves. and yes please dont make Amazon.com flea market, where people sale the stuff by saying ""FULL"" and it is half-empty.Take Care,MudassirSan Jose, CA"
5,A sociological masterpiece,"This book brilliantly addresses the issue of a non family friendly society that focuses more on the tenents of capitalism than the health and well being of children. Excellent discourse, research, and recommendations...A must read for all who are interested in issues of disparity, family strucutre, health, and culture."
3,"I started this, then realized that I had better things to do.","I'm saving this for a rainy day, in a hurricane, when the power is out, if I'm trapped by a flood, or if I'm pinned in by tornado debris, everyone else on the planet has been raptured, and I'm starving. It should be good, with a little ketchup."
5,AMAZING GAME,This game is the best tactical & military game ever played before. You command or get into like a soldier or squad commander. Weapons are good and very realistic in precision or adjust before get target. If you want take advantage on the game I recommend Headset for get and put commands.
1,if you preordered the game+free headset...,"I received a headset with no game. Now Amazon is no longer offering the game + free headset, and changed the instructions for getting the free headset (of course it's not available). I wonder how many people were ripped off $50 for a crappy headset and not having the game that preordered just to be one of the first people to recieve the much anticipated game!"
1,Why is Amazon avoiding an explanation on the non-delivery of my preorder?,"I preordered this game in May, and have still yet to receive it. Amazon will not explain why I do not have a copy in my hands, but yet they went ahead and charged me for it. This is sketchy to say the least. Buyers beware here. I could have just went to Wal-Mart and bought the damn thing. This is ludacris. This is also the third review I have written of them, and they have yet to post one. Hmm..."
1,Terrible,"What crappy game play. The first person shooter aspect is miserable. You shoot and shoot but they don't die, lame. The menu interface is slow and laggy. The whole dam game is laggy. You better have at least a 2 Gig micro and a 2 gig of ram to play any good at all. A high performance video card is a must at least a 6600GT. al in all I feel I was ripped off. I loved Battlefield 1942 and Vietnam but BF2 is crap. I would ask for my money back but they wouldn't give it to me. I just won't buy any more games from EA."
4,Very good game,"This game shows the growth of the BF group and has the best graphics of the 3 which I own. There are some issues such as poor aircraft control with single player maps being restrictive. Also, boats are to far from the dock in one scenario requiring diving into the water to board - not to realistic. I also have the expansion pack and great scenarios. Do have one issue with it - the night airport scenario crashes my system at various points - suspect it may be overloading the 256M ATI 850XT platinum graphics card. Have not yet tried it with Fang."
2,Buggy and For high end PCs,Great Game. Really nice gameplay ideas. Unfortunately EA released a Beta not a finished product. They released a patch within days that caused more issues then patched again. I believe that its a shame that this game was rushed out.It requires a high end Video card and at least 2GB of ram to run properly.If you are prepared to contantly upgrade and patch this is the game for you.
5,BattleField 2 is the greatest,Ever since I bought it i couldn't stop playing it! Its a reat game even though I do wish their was more then just the capture the flag like BattleField 1942 had but besides that the graphics are amazing!
5,Battlefield 2,This game is the best Battlefield ever released. I love the maps and online play. The only thing I don't like about this game is on some of the online servers there seems to be lag. Other than that it seems to be a great game. It is worth the $50.00 it cost.
2,broke easily,"This is a beautiful watch that came nicely packaged. I received many compliments as it looks like a bracelet. However, I dropped it on the floor while trying to put it on shortly after purchase and it cracked. I've dropped watches before but never had the face crack so easily."
5,GORGEOUS!!,This watch is gorgeous!! Very sophisticated and stylish. I'm so happy that I purchased it - I would recommend this to everyone!!!
3,Diamond Bracelet Watch,"Although it's a c watch, it quit after a week. I've sent it back to the manufacturer and have yet to receive it back or a replacement. That was two months ago. So I've got nothing for the money."
4,Very nice watch,I wanted a silver tone watch. This is an attractive watch and I have received many compliments. It has a link in the back which can be removed to make the watch smaller. Very convenient. I am happy with my purchase
5,LOVE THIS WATCH!,"This watch is one of my all time favorites. It is sleek, stylish, fun and funky without being too trendy. It feels classic and beautiful. In addition to looking great, it is primarily made with stainless steel, which does not fade or tarnish. This watch is great for dress up or casual. A great purchase - especially for the price!"
2,Disapointment!,"I was greatly hoping to see majestic steam locomotives and great american trains, but was so dissapointed at the sight of minor lumber small locos, cut sequences, bad framing, bad lighting, etc. A product not worth buying for a true lover of steam. Sorry!"
3,Decent cd player,"I know it was a cheap cd player, the sound is ok but I expected something a bit better, but I guess it's ok for morning exercise..."
4,Used,"I bought this used and it is working out well, but the earphones are too small to actually use and it doesnt open very well but the sound is awesome."
1,coby mp3/cd player anti skip,terrible product ....do not bother..you will just have to return...first time i used it it just started shutting off...like maybe it gets overheated or something
1,Bills Review,"This was a piece of junk, the cover would not stay closed. When trying to play a CD the screen kept showing the cover was open and it was closed. When you placed it down the cover pops open. You should remove this from your listing. Junk! I sent it back ASAP the next day."
2,Unreliable and cheap,"I bought this CD player about a week ago and the anti-skip is terrible on it. It skips when you walk with it, the sound quality is poor, and it lags when you try to skip tracks. The COBY company obviously does not know how to make a quality portable CD player and I am not very happy with my purchase. Stick with SONY or PANASONIC much better quality"
4,"A good deal for the money, but...","The only problems I found with this player are that the display is very small and hard to see if you are optically challenged as I am. Also, as mentioned somewhere below by another reviewer, it takes a long time to click through to a particular song, say #10 on the CD. I assume this is due to the 120 second skip protection, which is rather large.But on the other hand, it is light, thinner than my last CD player (a Philips)and louder than my last CD player. I bought this with the Sennheiser headphones which are an over-the-ear headphone so they don't hurt your ears. The two work well together. Another plus is this player plays a long time on two batteries; my last player took four.For the money, I can recommend it, especially since with 120 second skip protection you can practically take this thing on a trampoline and not have an interruption in your music."
1,Absolute junk,"This product is trash. The display did not work, and it skips tracks constantly. Colby also charges you 6 dollars to repair or replace their defective product. It's cheaply priced, but in the long run will cost you more money as you try to repair it. When the repair doesn't work, you'll end up spending more money on a better product."
1,Piece of Junk!,"Need a magnifying glass to read the text on the screen. Very unfriendly controls. To make it complete, it didn't function properly. Have to send it back to manufacturer and hope for the best since Amazon's return ploicy on open items isn't very nice. Stay away from this one!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Horrible.,"This product is far by the worst CD player I've ever owned. It's takes a while for the songs to read on the CD and the songs will randomly stop while the eye tries to read the disc. At first I thought it was just my CD, but I changed it through 8 CD's and the same thing happened. The anti-skip is also terrible like stated above. I wouldn't recommend this cancerous CD player to anyone. The headphones are also VERY uncomfortable. Please don't waste your money."
3,Mixed Feelings,"I bought this Coby CD player for my mom to listen to audio books. I rented an audio book from the library and the CD skipped repeatedly. Observing that there were some finger prints on the disc, I cleaned the disc. I played the CD on the Coby player once more and it continued to skip. I tried playing the disc on another audio device and the CD played fine. After reading reviews online about this particular Coby CD player I saw that skipping seemed to be a problem for some people with this player. To be fair, it may have been the dirty junk library CD. I don't know. Whatever, I was nonplussed by the whole experience and decided to returned the player to Amazon and get my money back."
1,Don't waste your money,"Husband bought this player at the PX. I was looking forward to having something with which to listen to audio book CDs -- really didn't care if has MP player or not -- just wanted to play CDs. After 3 days (and only 1-2 CDs) it has stopped working. Have fresh batteries in, the display says the cd is loaded, but it just sits there. It's not on hold, it's not on pause, but it won't play at all. And, since we had to cut it out of the packaging, and that was long thrown away -- and we can't return to PX without the original packaging, I'm just throwing it away and will never buy another product from this company. I'm very happy for the people who have purchased this product and it's working great for them, but I wish I had read the negative reviews and found out that so many don't work. I would definitely have reconsidered and purchased something else. If you do purchase this -- keep your packaging and receipt just in case. You may be thankful that you did!"
3,Great--With One Exception,I really like this CD player as I use it in the car when driving long distances to learn Italian. They only problem is I don't have a secure place to put in near me in the car and it slipped and fell and now the cover won't stay closed so I have to tape it shut in order for it to play. This was the reason why I replaced my previous one. I used to keep it shut with a rubber band but now I use tape. If the company could figure out how to keep the top more secure I would rate it higher.
1,Coby MPCD521 Personal MP3/CD Player,"Player used for listening to audiobooks in MP3 CD format.Continuously stops suddenly, I replace batteries and unit plays for very shortperiod of time and stops again. Very disappointed."
1,"Skips even when not moved at all, then just stops playing.","Not worth the return shipping cost.Bummer, guess too good to be true, IS too good to be true.Very dissapointing performance, and no ac or dc charger included.Good sound quality, very nice headphones, the few minutes it did play."
3,Coby MPCD521,Not a bad player. The only minor thing I didn't like was that the back and forward buttons were too close to each other. If you have a bigger hand you will have a little trouble with the buttons.
4,Low price;Good sound,"Surprised the sound was so clear on such a low price. Yes its, true the anti-skipping doesnt do very well since I ride a bus everyday and with all the bumps sometimes I have to start the CD over. The sound is great, looks great, make sure you buy batteries before hand (AA)."
4,Best Bang for the BUCK,"This mp3 was a great buy and has great sound ,Iwas quite pleased with my purchase .I recommend this player to anyone with limited funds and seeking great soundM. L."
2,Coby Portable CD/MP3 Player,This Cd/MP3 player came quicker then I expected BUT goes through batteries like no one's business. I would not recommend this as a gift unless you'd like to change batteries every hour or so.
5,Great Value for your money,"I bought two of this cd-mp3 player, and they works perfect. Great sound and it reads cds w mp3 very nice. No skip at all. I recommend this product. I bought them at 20.95 and i made my sister happy with it;)"
3,Decent CD player for the price,"Thus far, I've used my CD player only a few times, but it seems overall to work well. The only problem I'm having is that it likes to randomly skip in songs at times, sometimes forward, sometimes backward. The display is a little small. But it is a good player for the price, if you can't afford a better one."
1,Terrible product,"This product shows low battery display even when I put in brand new batteries. How can a new unit have such a problem. Unfortunately I have not saved the product packaging, otherwise I would have returned it."
1,My COBY MP-CD521 turned out to be junk,"I bought the COBY MP-CD521 which turned out to be very flaky. Most of the time it would not work with any disk. Once I got it to play a cd and then the second time that I tried to play the same cd it would not recognize it. Maybe you will be luckier than I was, but don't expect much."
3,Missing fast forward bottom!,"I purchased this item specifically for audio books recorded in MP3 CD. I also like audio books but have not tried them yet. I'm happy about my purchase. It works very well, sounds great and it is easy to use, specially when I'm exercising, cooking or working in the garden. The only problem is that I have to hear the whole chapter each time, I cannot stop it until the chapter ends. The feature that is missing is a bottom that takes me to where I stopped in the chapter if I could not finish it. Or re-start from where I stopped when I had to interrupt, not re-start the chapter from the beggining."
4,best cd player sound,"good sound i think you will ever get on a cd player,with full headphones its much better than any mp3 player that i have heard,thanks"
1,Coby Mp - CD521,"Within 10 days of buying this product, the Lid of the CD player does not close and lock properly. Poor mechanism. Need to get it replaced."
1,Not worth the money,"I purchased this cd player to replace a Sony that I dropped 20 or 30 times too many. I only listen to books on cd and this is horrible. Every time I get next to an electrical appliance (microwave, computer, printer or even another radio) I get nothing but interference. It wouldn't be so bad except that it even reacts to my noise cancelling headphones. I am trashing this one and buying another Sony."
2,coby mpcd321,"it will not play my mp3 players, I have read the instructions but it keeps skipping words and miss a lot of the story I cannot use it."
1,Stopped working immediately,"The first time I used this, it worked fine. The second time the LCD screen read 'no ID' and then it immediately shut off, and it won't do anything else. No harm came to it, it just sat on my table and decided it no longer wanted to live."
1,junk,I bought this cd player in June and it ate batteries. It's now the beginning of Oct and new batteries in again except it won't play at all!! Piece of junk. Wish I'd known. I wouldn't waste my money again.
5,SCORPIONS RULE!,"Best bang for your pepsi points. Sounds good jammin on some SCORPIONS on it, and sippin on a cold one, oh man, someone put some pepsi in my rum, Yeah! Great product, got here fast too. Five stars."
4,Review For COBY MP- CD521,"I am very impress with the transaction, no problems. The product in excellent condition just as described. Will certainly do business again."
2,Does the cd player skip alot..Im looking to put one in my care?/,i need a cd player to use in my car.. I want one that rearelyof if ever skips
1,"Cheap, but still not worth it","The item quit working after about a week of use. It just simply quit playing CDs altogether. I procrastinated and waited longer than 30 days to seek a refund, now I'm stuck with sending it back to the manufacturer. They require a $6 shipping/handling fee, which is too much considering the cost of the item. I'll just trash it and buy a Sony, which I should have done in the first place."
5,This portable player plays MP3 cd files!!!!!,I really like this player because I am now able to listen to the MP3 files I bought online from an old time radio website. I can now hear Little Orphan Annie which has like fifty odd episodes on one cd. I am able to pick up where I left off the last time I listened. I don't have to start over from the very beginning as some people complain about. The instructions are very clear and if you read them you won't have a problem. I only wish I had an AC adapter as they suggest you use one while listening at home so not to wear out the battery. What is also cool about this player is that you can use rechargeable batteries and the player will recharge the batteries for you when you flip a certain button. How cool is that?Very cool! : ) By the way [...] has loads of old time radio shows and broadcasts if you are curious.
1,Broke after 1.5 months,"I'm very disappointed with the CD player. After only a month and a half of having it, it doesn't read the CDs. Such as waste of money!!!"
2,Definitely not happy!,The top doesn't close good and the esp actually skips. I really don't think this product measures up at all. It's awesome that it plays mp3's but I hate that it skips and I have to keep making sure that nothing gets in under the huge gap between the bottom and the top.
1,COBY MP-CD521 Player,"This is a terrible product. When you turn off the CD, you must disconnect the batteries or they run out. To disconnect the batteries, you must use a knife since they don't come out with just fingers. The CD skips at the least jostle (not even running). There is no warning that the batteries are running low. The CD just stops. When you turn the CD off, it will not resume at the same place if it is off for more than a few minutes, but goes back to the beginning. AWFUL."
2,A Good Looking Unit.,"This CD unit is quite attractive... Yet quite frustrating. Out of the package I found the battery compartment to be designed poorly as it never stays secure. The batteries are exposed, but the main frustration is the chance to actually break of the compartments cover. (I quess the only trick would be a bit of tape.)But the biggest flaw design wise is the extremely non-illuninated program indicator. I'm amazed how difficult it is to see your programing results or to monitor them. I had to go by counting the button pressings and test the reults ... memorising the counts! What a drag!But darn if it isn't a COOL looking product!"
1,Save your money or Pepsi Points,"I got this item as a backup with Pepsi Stuff points.I wish I had not wasted them.This CD player is just about at the bottom of the barrel. It is flimsy, the sound is not that great - way too loud at around 100 hz - no memory, and very few decent features, and the skip protection doesn't work.My advice, look at other products. And don't waste your money or Pepsi Stuff points on this. In two months it will be in the trash can."
1,Anti-Skip?,"Every cd I played kept skipping. I keep all of my CDs in great condition, but this proved irrelevant. Highly disappointed with this purchase."
3,Not a Sony,"A functional mp3 player, a choice of one.Does not remember place on disk when unit is turned off. You have to hunt for the place to resume.First set of batteries lasted only one day. Not enough data to determine if this unit is a battery hog."
4,"Coby MPCD521 Personal MP3/CD Player with 120 Second Anti-Skip Protection, Black","Have a need for a product that most kids have never seen. This is one of those. My wife has rekindled(no pun intended) a joy of reading. Problem is, she doesn't have time to sit and read. Solution...she puts this unit into her holster and listens to her books on CD. She loves it and the only negative is that unlike TV, I never know when it is a good time to talk. She considers this a big bonus. Works well and I suggest you get rechargeable batteries and a recharge unit to save on cost of batteries."
1,Piece of crap,It lasted 40 days. Now it doesn't work anymore. Complete waste of money and I've already passed the return window. DO NOT BUY THIS THING.
2,Junk!,"The sound is good but performance is quirky. Sometime it plays and sometimes it doesn't. Skips when I play audio CD's in the car.Has two levels of anti-skip; higher level apparently only applies to MP3 and level for CD is too low. Interested in anti-skip feature mainly because I like to listen to music while jogging and in the car. Only listen to audio CD's. If Coby wants to appeal to both CD and MP3 markets, a better solution would be to create a combo CD + Mp3 player. No reason I can think of why they couldn't do that.I'll be returning this player and getting a Sony."
1,it stopped working !!!!,It worked fine for about a week and now does not work at all. I put in new batteries -- no results. I made sure the batteries were properly installed -- still no good. I wish to return this product.
5,quality for the price / points,I got two of these for my kids they work great they are easy for a 7 year old and even thethree year old can change the cd and find his selection on a cd.the sound was reat for a unit in this price point.If you are looking for a gift fora child you can't go wrong with this one.
5,Coby MP3 player,I have enjoyed this MP3 as I get to listen to my books on audio that are for MP3. It is amazing how technology has advanced.
4,Worked Great for What I Needed It For,"I purchased this MP3 player for listening to some lecture mp3 disks during my review for the bar exam. I used this device for about 2 hrs everyday for 75 days, I used it in the car, on the elliptical machine, and when walking and did not experience any problems. During my entire use of this device, it never skipped, I only had to replace the batteries twice (I did use some high quality batteries, though), and it overall worked great for what I needed it for. I will say that the display is tiny, so unless there is ample light, it can be difficult to see the display. Other than that, I was very satisfied with this product!"
1,Worthless,"I've been using this CD player for less than 3 months and it's already dead. It wasn't great to begin with-it has pretty poor sound quality and it eats through batteries like crazy. I use it at work, and it wouldn't even last a day on the batteries. I noticed that it started making noise as the CD spun, and it died the next day. It hadn't been dropped, and the AC adapter I bought for it was high quality (cost more than the CD player actually), so it seems like this product is just a lemon."
1,Just too cheap,"I thought a cd player like this would have good sound, but it is awfull and bussing through any earphones I use including the ones it came with. Not a good choice even with 120 second anti-skip protection!"
1,"i gave it the benefit of the doubt, but it's an awful thing","in spite of the negative reviews, i decided to give it a go, and grant it the benefit of the doubt - as mp3 cd players seem to be few and far in between, and the next model was 40 bucks more (a sony). the buttons are chunky and cheap, the screen is all but illegible, and the button which opens the disk cover... it is pressed of its own accord when the player is placed in a backpack/armsling bag. there just isn't a redeeming quality for it. returning!"
2,Poor choice,"Just wanted to mention that I bought this CD/mp3 player intending to use it to listen to my audiobooks.Well, it didn't work out so well. It would lose my place all the time and sometimes get stuck so I just gave up on it. It may be okay for listening to music.Compared to my old one which is several years old,the construction is pretty flimsy. I can't even imagine dropping it...it would probably shatter. So, I am back to using my old broken one until I find a suitable replacement. Again, if you are purchasing this so that you can listen to audiobooks, I would advise buying a more expensive CD/mp3 player."
1,Don't waste your money.,It couldn't read either MP3 disc or regular CD and the liquid indicator wouldn't come on. Threw it in the garbage.
1,Biggest piece of junk I ever bought,Anti skip doesn't work at all try to walk 10 feet and you loose the sound. Goes through batteries faster than any player I have ever owned. Door to hold disk in pops open with the slightest jar and you have to start the cd over because it does not continuing playing where it left off. Spend the extra few bucks for a better quality player.
3,Calaloo-Boo HOO,Calaloo was a mini CD sold only at Best BUY stores. There's nothing special about it unless you're a real collector of JB and just gotta have it. I bought a ton of these and sold them for 3-4 times what they were worth on Ebay....I had a feeding frenzy. Now I can't give them away.
4,good and strong,"I was using it in my office as a chair, but my son now uses it outside in the yard. Seems to be pretty puncture proof.The smell of it is very strong, any I left it out for week and washed it down a few times before I brought it in the house."
2,Overheating,"This product overheats and will not finish playing the DVD. After stoping the DVD, the product send a message ""Wrong Disk"" and will not play another DVD until it cools off."
4,Birthday gift,This was birthday gift for my wife. The watch was exactly as per the description and arrived in quick time although I live outside the US.I earned quite a number of 'brownie points'. I would certainly review Amazon when looking to purchase anything in the future.
4,Really nice everyday watch,"Other than being way too big for my wrist when it first arrived and costing me $15 to get 3 links removed, this is a great watch. It is a great blend of casual meets dressy and very comfortable to wear. I would definitely recommend!"
4,Beautiful watch but date is very hard to read!,We bought this watch for our mom for Christmas hoping it would be easier for her to read than her dark faced watch. It is easier to read the time with the silver background but the date is very hard to read. The watch itself is of high quality and very beautiful. She was satisfied with it but we wished it would have met all her needs/expectations.
2,Disappointed,"It doesn't present like the picture, disappointed that I purchased it. It looks less expensive than it's purchase price. Not a good value."
4,Lovely looking watch,"I like my watch. The only problem is my wrist is so small, when I went in to have it sized they could only take out so many links. So, I wear it like a bracelet. One more link, and it would have be perfect. I still like it though."
4,Anne Klein watch,very attractive watch. The date is a little too small hard to read. Very nice face had to take a couple links out for my girlfriend. other then the date being too small she loves the watch
3,Beautiful Watch!,"This watch is so pretty, I get complements on it every time I wear it. The only downside is it contains nickle, which for some may not be an issue but for me it is. I am allergic to nickle and this watch must have quite a bit in it."
5,AK watch,Love love love my new watch!!! I had seen it some place else and it was much more expensive! And it fits perfect!
5,Simply the best,"After trying out many other earplugs we find Mack's are the very best. They are soft, fit perfectly in your ear and lock out all sound around you. We travel a lot and use them also in airplanes. When listening to the music programs or watching a movie, you just have to turn up the sound as far as it goes, and the noise from the plane, snoring seat neighbors or crying babies does not bother you anymore. They are just wonderful!Mack's Safe Sound Soft Foam Earplugs 10 pair"
3,a bit over priced,"i should have went to walmart, they sell it there for a buck! other than that, it does the job"
2,Didn't work out that well for me,"I've used other similar products with much better results.For some reason these never really seemed to fit too well into my ear and therefore didn't do that great of a job at blocking out the noise.I'm sure these can work for many people, but my ears must have been the wrong type or something."
3,Eh,"I've tried about four different ear plug brands so far. I have to admit, I wasn't satisfied with this brand. I have two guinea pigs in a cage in my room at night, and I try to use ear plugs to stop some of the noise. When I tried to use this product, I loved the way they kept their shape when I went to put them in my ear. However, compared to my other ear plug's, I could hear every little noise my pets made. Halfway through the night, I ended up switching to my other ear plugs. My other ear plugs claimed to reduce the same amount of noise and I couldn't hear my pets at all.I'll give it three stars for the way they kept their shape, but they didn't do what I bought them for."
2,Used to work before they changed them,"My husband snores so the only way I can sleep is by wearing ear plugs. This brand used to work very well at blocking out the noise, but recently the company changed them. Now they hardly block any sound at all, the ones that used to work have a smooth texture - the new design is rougher and much thinner."
5,Better then expected,The delivery was within excellent time. The book itself was in better condition then I expected given it's age. I am very pleased.
4,"Ok, but its only the beginning","OK, I don't read much of the svu series, being all of 12, but I thought that this one was pretty good. If you want to read the series from beginning to end, its a good place to start, it will make you enjoy the rest of the series a lot more."
5,I really enjoyed this book,"This book was really good. I couldn't put it down. If you're like me, sometimes in a series, you read some numbers before the first one. For me, this book really explained a lot about the plot. If you like mystery, comedy, and Sweet Valley books, this is definitely the one to read."
1,Very disappointed,"I purchased this DVD for my husband who wants to learn to play the Banjo. He's a truck driver so he can't take lessons from a real live person. We thought this DVD would be good for him while he's out on the road. Unfortunately that is not the case. Though Buddy Wachter may be an excellent banjo player he sucks as a teacher for beginners. He drones on and on about things and then when it comes times to actually ""learn"" he is too fast. If you've never played banjo and want to learn - don't buy this DVD."
1,Read the reviews before you buy,"As the previous reviews pointed out, most of these are not the original recordings and definitely not worth the money. I would give it 0 stars if I could."
5,DA REAL KING OF DA SOUF,"Every song iz FI. production iz xcellent. he keep it real like alot a folks dont.i been listenin ta Troy since day 1 when ""We Ready I Declare War"" came out. hataz KILL YASELF.ATL FA LIFE. ZONE 4"
3,Anonymous dual probes,"The thermometer works as well as many others with single probes, and is easy to use. My main criticism is that the probes should be color-coded on both ends to make it easier to identify which is which. With the lid closed on a grill or bbq unit, it's very easy to lose track of which probe is going where."
3,Doesn't do everything as described,"Based on product descriptions, I chose this item over a more expensive modelMaverick Two-In-One Oven and Roasting Digital Thermometer with Timerbecause ET-83 was suupposed to give a reading of oven temperature as well as cooking temperatures for two meats. Sounded like a great deal! However... ET-83 is only useful for knowing the temperatures of two meats. It does that very well, actually. I will have to purchase another thermometer to know when my oven is properly preheated. Live and learn."
1,"bad design, bad product","I got one of these w/ my shuffle.Don't waste your money!!!Horrible design. With the velco in the back, against your skin, if you do work up a good sweat (running) the moisture will seep right through and soak your shuffle. The velcro at the top and bottom seams is woefully inadequate.My shuffle died after only 2 months, b/c the repeated exposure to moisture (sweat via running) did it in.And the earplug access is um, a challenge, as best.Keep looking."
4,Great Shuffle holder band!!,The band is very sturdy but the hole for the ear phones is extremely small and hard to get the plug in and out!! But other then that I love it!!
2,Missleading Title,"First of all , Kovalchuk was a rookie in 01' 02' , not 03'. The cards were kind of sticking together. Pulled two Jerseys, Jagr and Hnilicka. A couple of inserts and a ton of parallels. Overall , if you are in the mood for rippin a cheap box, or buying some cards for a not so serious collector, its good. If you are going for some GOOD cards, don't buy this box."
2,Not so hot...,"This is probably the weakest of MTT's Mahler cycle so far, in my opinion. I essentially agree with the first reviewer (at the bottom) that this performance is micro-managed. That is not necessarily a bad thing, but here it just didn't work. The performance never gains enough momentum, and too often phrases do not flow from one to the next. Often times they stagnate from poorly chosen tempi. The 3rd movement in particular is just TOO SLOW!!! Yes, MTT, we know its gorgeous music, yes we all want to bask in its glory - but there comes a point where it stops being beautiful and just becomes boring. I had a hard time getting through this performance. It's not terrible, but there's much better options out there."
1,micromanaged Mahler,"""Fussy"" and ""precious"" (as in ""excessively refined"") were among the words that came to mind once I overcame the torpor induced by this immaculately played, beautifully recorded dud. It's hard to imagine a conductor of stature missing the point as completely as Thomas does here, in Mahler's ""simplest"" symphony. Not a single phrase is left alone; everything is micromanaged to death. It's like a parody of Bernstein's mannerisms without the older maestro's urgent sense of communication. Its 62-minute playing time--only about a minute more than Lorin Maazel's slower-than-usual recording, but seemingly twice as long--just adds insult to injury."
2,Nice looking by does not handle well,"This is a good looking product, but the looks come with a cost.The openning to pour the oil in is very small and hard to do without a funnel.After pouring the oil in to the fry pan, the spout drips the oil on the outside of the container, causing me to clean it each time I use it."
4,"For all ""Women of Independent Means""","Sally Fields is always a pleasure to watch. With this movie she--believably--ages 70 years. For those who want to spend a day curled up with a good movie, this is it!"
3,A Woman of Independent Means,I was disappointed in this movie. It was ok but not one that I will watch over and over.
2,True to heart,Don't waste your money. The miniseries is long and boring. I love Sally Fields but the script sucked. They jump from time to time to time (ten and twenty years in time) without enough substance in the year they were in previously. She goes from being very young to middle age to old and somehow the stories were left out. Very poor writing. I'd pass on this one.
2,Blurry pictures,The camera was a exact replacement for the camera being used that began taking grainy pictures. The replacement camera took pictures that were even worse. The old camera was connected back to the computer. Not totally sure that the problem is even with the camera. Probably the program that the pictures are being imported to.
3,"Quality of Picture ok, but sound linkup needs help","This was my first use of a webcam. I am satisfied with the Quality of the Picture , but sound linkup needs help. Sort of like watching a movie recorded in Chinese and played back with an English overlay."
2,CHOOSE SOMETHING BETTER,Don't waste your time with this one. It forces you to load Windows Live Chat. Only works on certain sites. Needs a very bright light source to work properly. Spend a few bucks more.
4,"Good Hardware, Marginal Software","Microsoft shipped this product with inadequately tested software. I have bought a few. The software is improving, but it still requires a large download of a software update pack to get it current. Figure on a 20-30 installation and update process, which doesn't include your Video Messaging software (Windows Live Messenger expected by Microsoft)."
3,"Works well enough, but...","I couldn't for the life of me get the web cam installed and had to do major research on my own to learn that if you have installed a logitech web cam prior to this install, then you must delete the logitech driver! I actually went through the device manager and figured it out, but boy, did it take some research and headache to do it. The picture is not the greatest, but for the money works fine."
1,Very disappointing,"Was $50, but on sale for $27. Picture quality was terrible; couldn't even make out faces on the other end (Skype). Bought a Logitech for $87 and love it!"
2,Ehh.,"This was the first webcam I had purchased in several years, and so I was very disappointed when I installed this, and discovered that the picture/video quality it yields is no better than the webcam I had those several years prior. Not to mention that I couldn't get the microphone to work properly.The the advertisements for this camera are very misleading and in this day in age, Microsoft should not use words like ""high def"" to describe the mediocre-at-best output of this camera.The only reason I didn't give it 1 star was because it actually worked. Regardless, I will be returning it tomorrow."
2,Was disappointed!,I got this camera to operate on my Vista OS. I was so surprised at the lag between my voice and the video. This may be caused by my internet connection but I do have cable broadband. It's just an alright camera and if you want something more high quality then stay away from this one.
2,not so great,"I bought this at Staples due to limited selection... I am not very happy with it at all. The manual focus adjust is just ridiculous and the camera is so flimsy it feels like it came out of a cracker jack box. The image is strange and grainy and looks absolutely horrible in low light. I far prefer the Creative camera I have (but it is not compatible with Vista so I had to buy a new one), I may go ahead and buy another Creative.Also there are annoying pop ups at start up that are driving me crazy... anyone know how to get rid of those?"
4,Worth it's cost,"This camera is certainly not the nicest out there, but it does the trick for around $30. Picture is decent."
4,Does the job with no fuss,I ordered this camera so that I could use skype for video conversations among family and grandchildren. Works great right out of the box.
2,video good audio not so good,"I set this camera up and liked the video quality. was pretty good even in low light. The recording hesitated some on start of recording and became part of the video. the problem was when I recorded video w/sound and sound. The audio effetively didn't work. I could record with windows ""Sound Recorder"" and the audio appeared okay but it wasn't very loud. Even with the mic all the way up. I tried to use the steps outlined in the software to repair and it didn't work. No audio played at all on playback. Since I am only three feet away I consider this to be not so good.Easy to install, picture quality is good, but couldn't get the audio to work in the software. Leaving now to return the item. Too bad though because when I initially plugged it in I thought it was going to be a fun toy."
1,LAG LAG VIDEO LAG,"Video is clear, audio is okay, but did I mention the lag? The video lags the audio. The lag while talking is worse than a cheap 1960's foreign flick with english voice overs. Did I mention the lag? If you are trying to impress someone, this unit will do the opposite due to the video lag. Did I mention the lag? I double checked my hardware requirments, and my hardware far exceeded the hardware requirments for the unit. Did I mention the lag? I guess if you are not trying to match video up with audio; then, the lag will not matter. Did I mention the lag? How on earth could the other reviews not mention the lag. Did I mention the lag? If there is a chance for lag between video and audio, why is there not an adjustment to sync them up? Did I mention the lag? I am returning this thing and just use my camcorder--for now."
2,Not Worth the Money,"I was willing to pay extra bucks thinking Microsoft make better product but after 2 months of use, still I was disappointed mostly because of their voice software that triggers each time you touch the top button witch can be easyly done by accident. And there is no way to disactivated it. Finally I sold it on Ebay and bougth a less expensive Creative Live Cam Notebook Pro that works 10 times better. Lesson learn: ""Big names don't always make better products but usually cost good dollars."""
1,Not Vista compatible,"Even Microsoft will not make its own hardware where it will work with Windows Vista. Notice in the specs, it's missing from the list of OS's."
1,Microsoft will drop their support for hardware when ever they want.,"Just a heads up to anyone considering buying some hardware with the Microsoft brand name. I bought a Microsoft MN-710 wireless router and network adapter a couple years back. You'd expect it to have drivers automatically install for Vista or Windows 7, right? No! There aren't any, not even for download. It's worthless and I have to replace it now and it makes me angry. I have older hardware that the companies updated their drivers, and work with Vista and Windows 7.Buy your hardware from a hardware vendor not a software vendor. Microsoft will not care about you or your silly web cam 2-3 years from now, when you are looking for a new driver."
1,From a smokey bar,"I received the item on time. However, it smelled like someone's been smoking on it for the last thousand years. Mind you, this was supposed to be a new product. Imagine quality is good, but the ""built-in"" mic doesn't work. All I get out of it is some weird Morris Code type sound. I have to turn the sound off from the camera and use another mic."
1,Don't hold your breath,"Look at the date of these reviews; Microsoft doesn't even support this product anymore. I bought mine a few years ago and it's fuzzy, the sound is lousy and Microsoft acts like the product doesn't even exist. I have a garage with Microsoft's force-feed back steering wheel, and joystick, both of which cost a lot of money and neither of which Microsoft supports anymore. They talk about pan and tilt and zoom but mine doesn't have any of that and Microsoft doesn't have any downloads for it either! This is exactly why everyone is buying Apple products and you should definitely short sell Microsoft."
2,First Webcam - Pretty useless for anything but chat.,"Length:: 1:18 MinsJust giving my experience with the Lifecam VX-3000, and introducing the new webcam I got. I was back and forth to Walmart three times this week. The other webcams I returned was the Philips SPC 1000NC (It was riddled with bugs! Never seemed to work right) and a HP USB Webcam (Just disappointing video quality, 1-2 sec. lag in audio). Logitech is the best guys!"
2,Garbage,"This was product was a dissapointment for me. The picture is decent, but the built-in microphone is completely worthless. And for the tiny amount of sound it manages to pick up, it is completely out of sync with the video. This creates an unnecessary amount of frustration for me. For what I paid, I expected to have a microphone that could pick up my voice from more than three inches away. Even the directions indicate that the microphone should be used three to five inches away. What is the point of having a webcam if I have to be that close to it?Another function I hoped to get some use out of was the still picture function. But again, it is worthless. Still pictures were blurry and little detail could be made out.The box also advertised a pan and zoom function, but this is a complete crock. All it does is crop the picture making a decent picture very blurry. Same thing with the face-recognition function.In conclusion: Avoid this product."
1,Trash,"The microphone has a very loud hum or buzz. There is no support for it, no warranty information, Microsoft site keeps leading me to pay for support. Don't purchase."
2,I paid thirty bucks for this?,"I've heard constant reviews about this camera being great AND cheap. So I bought it. Thirty bucks, down the tube. And I thought I was getting something decent.The sound is horrible, for one. It's completely disconnected from your movements and about two days after I got this, the microphone blew out and stopped working. It was gently handled, and the only sound it had been exposed to was low talking.There's also the grainy quality and the fact that if you take a picture, you could almost get better quality from a camera phone. It also gets hot after about five minutes of recording.Overall, this is disappointing, not what it's made out to be. I would suggest a different model to any and everyone."
1,disappointed,"Very impressed with the video, Totally disappointed with the microphone. Am going to return it and try to locate a logitech."
4,Not bad,What can you say about a Webcam? It performs as advertised. I'd like more features but you really can't expect much from a USB Webcam.
4,Quality of picture is better than expected,"This is a great little camera. The size is good, and several people have commented on the quality of the picture for a webcam. For some reason, I've had to re-load the software a few times, but I'll have to get into that and figure it out. Minor irritation, and I'm sure it's something I'm not doing right. I like the camera, the price was good, I'd buy it again."
4,MS VX-3000,"nice webcam, very happy with the purchase. Be careful of the button on top though. It holds on to my laptop nicely and picture and sound quality are great."
4,not compatible with Vista 64-bit,"The video quality is good, and the camera is easy to set up.* Works with just about all IM clients, and does not require Windows Live Messenger to do anything other than the automatic configuration wizard. The microphone is not so great; the integrated one in my Lenovo Thinkpad X61t works far better.Tip: The ""Live Call"" button can be disabled by deleting, moving, or renaming the ""IcePick.exe"" file in the program directory.*I have two computers: a custom-built desktop with Vista Ultimate 64-bit, and a Thinkpad X61t with Vista Business 32-bit. This camera would not work with 64-bit Vista, no matter how hard I tried. It works flawlessly with Vista 32-bit, though."
4,Lifecam,The camera is very nice and easy to use. It is a very good way of communicating with people around the world .we like it lot .
4,button on top is annoying,"I like this camera with one exception: the Windows Live Call button on the top is very annoying. Nearly every time I try to adjust the camera's position, I accidentally push the top button and it tries to launch/install Windows Live Messenger. If you are using Live Messenger, it is probably fine, but if you don't intend to install that software (I use my camera for video chatting in Gmail) it can be irritating to have the Install Windows Live Messenger message always pop up when all you want to do is slightly tweak the camera's position."
2,Frustrating experience,"The way the description of this webcam sounds you would think that all you have to do is plug it in and it works. Well, don't be deceived! I have had to do more research and spent numerous hours trying to get this thing to work as described. I followed the directions and had it installed with no problem, but when I tried to use it with Skype my video feed kept freezing up on the receiving end, and when using it with Microsoft Messenger the voice wasn't in sync with the video and was very choppy and not as clear.I looked all over the web for fixes. I downloaded an update for the driver, and even did some of the suggestions by others with similar problems. To no avail. I finally hooked it up to my ancient laptop where the picture isn't as good, but at least it doesn't freeze up on the other end (as it did on my desktop) and use it there, but it just isn't what I was hoping for and doesn't work as described."
4,"Great camera for Skype, and very easy to use and install.","This camera was very easy to install and a breeze to use. It is easy to focus and has great options to use if I am in a darker area. My only two concerns are that to use it with Skype I have to have the camera off before starting Skype and have to use Skype to turn the camera on or it will not work, also, I have not yet figured out how to use some of the fun add ins that come with the camera while using Skype. But the picture is clear, the sound it great, and it is simple enough for even my non-computer/technology savvy parents and in-laws to use."
3,It works.,"I have only used once so far, and it seemed to work fine- it seems to be basic, but it works. The installation was a wee bit confusing, but I am not a camera/computer wiz. It does not easily attach to my laptop however, so if that is what you're looking for, keep looking. Aside from that, if you want a basic camera without all the frills, this works."
2,Poor visual quality,I selected this particular camera based on all of the numerous reviews I read. I was highly disappointed when my family reported the grainy picture quality they received when I skyped with them. I bought this camera soley for the purpose of communicating with my family via skype and the picture quality is very poor. Based on the reviews I read it makes me wonder if I just received a malfunctioned camera. Unfortunately I have already purchased the same camera for my mother-in-law. I plan to contact Microsoft in regards to the grainy picture quality it is producing.
3,Lackluster,"The good things: It's smaller, compact, looks nice, has the face zoomThe bad things: It has very low quality resolution. None of the configurations produces anything enjoyable to look at. It's like taking off your glasses and seeing blurred shapes moving onscreen.Next time: I'll look for a better resolution option."
2,Just not good,"When it comes to a webcam, picture quality is the number one thing I'm looking for. This one was VERY grainy. I tested in yahoo messenger, msn, skype, and just to take a picture. It was grainy is all programs and any settings. The it did do well in low lighting but still I had a nice grainy picture in low light. At the same time I bought a Logitech Webcam C210 for around the same price. It was a night and day difference. They are quoted as having the same stats but WOW the Logitech was much better."
2,Not good and Better buy a $6 one (as it is same product!),"Not at all satisfied with this purchase.Overly priced than similar product I bought for $6, both has same features, same drivers, s/w etc!I paid about $25 for it.Picture quality is ok for casual video chat (do not expect good pictures/video).Needs manual focus using silly controls on webcam.Sound is ok, something that Skype worked well.Camera is sensitive to background lighting.All video effects are very basic and using s/w from Microsoft Lifecam (too bloated).And video effects do not work well on dual-core PC!!! e.g. goggles stick across forehead/eyes!Other paid webcam s/w also do not work well with camera on video effects.Low-light mode shows video OK, but it is discolored on other side when Skype is used!Won't fit on top of LCD monitors.Won't fit well on top of Laptop screen, and slips off frequently!Not a good purchase for the price.better buy similar one from roadside stores for $5-6."
5,good cam,"I have found this to be and average webcam. this webcam mic is not very good, but if you have an internal mic on laptop turn your mic off on the camera and it work great that way. This cam has good picture. I would recommend to anyone that is looking for a cheap webcam."
4,Microsoft LifeCam VX-3000 (68A-00001),"This is a great product. The value is amazing. This unit includes features such as facial tracking and with the included software is easy to setup and get your face on the net. Works with every IM program, that I have, that uses webcams."
3,"Camera ok, Mic not so good","I bought this webcam and had it sent to my mom and dad so I could talk to them over skype. the setup of the webcam was easy. the camera itself worked good, good picture. there is a known problem with the mic in this webcam though, which I didn't find out till after the fact. the problem is a buzzing sound on the receiving end of whoever you are talking too, I thought maybe the webcam was to close to my dads speakers and or monitor, but after some reseach online I found this to be a known problem, well, a long story short my dad didn't want to deal with returning the webcam, so I ordered a separate mic with a stereo connection, switching the mic over to this separate mic was like night and day, I could actully talk to my dad without have to put up with a buzzing noise"
3,Just adequate,"This was purchased to be a gift, so I only used it for a short time to test it. As the title said, I would rate it only as adequate, not great, nor as good as I might have expected. My point of comparison is a Creative Labs Live! Cam Video IM Pro, which is superior. The VX-3000 is OK for video and poor for still images under normal room light. I should have tried it with much brighter lighting while I had it but did not; that would likely have made a positive difference. The software provides some special effects with more appeal for children than adults. Installation under XP was routine. I would have been more disappointed if I had paid full price with no rebate."
5,Exactly what I wanted!,I was looking for something simple yet affordable. This is perfect! My kids love using it! Compared to the more expensive cameras this one has my vote!!!
1,Poor quality video with unusable microphone,"I am a Microsoft user and have had good experiences with other Microsoft hardware so I was astounded at how poorly this webcam performed.Besides the fact that the video quality was poor there was a persistent buzz in the audio that made the camera instantly unusable. And worse, there was no way to turn it off in the settings in order to use an alternate microphone! After a quick internet search it seems this is a problem many people have had. Sometimes the mic works fine before it dies after a period of time. The Windows ""integration"" is also more of a problem than a feature. The video chat button is placed so that every time you adjust the camera Windows Messenger pops up.Maybe I have a defective product (also not a great recommendation for this cam) but this thing was a waste of time and money for me. I sincerely recommend trying another company's product."
3,good image quality but bad software,"All over this camera gives a good quality of the image. However the software freezes the computer and you have to shut it down to make it work again. I had to eventually remove the livecam software from my computer. The camera also prompts you to install messenger but does not work properly in it. I am using this camera for Skype, it seems to be fine so far."
4,It's good webcam. Nice picture quality at even low light,"Nice experience after purchasing. Buy this, no problem at all"
1,The usual Microsoft garbage,"Purchased this so I could Skype with my kids, who don't havefancy PCs. Won't work with Windows 2000 - the usual Microsoft BS approach to customers: pay major $$$ to upgrade everything or else! Nothingon the packaging to warn you it only works with Vista or XP (which Microsoft is planning to stop supporting soon- so pay up!). Ugh. I'm glad I'm migrating to Macintosh computers."
3,I have not been able to use it yet.,"I guess if I knew other people with it, I would be okay with it. I thought my daughter and grand daughter had one."
3,Why do I have to install anything?,"This is camera made by Microsoft with a statement on the front of the package that says ""Works great with Windows Vista.""It comes with a disk containing 268MB of files to be installed. The usb plug on the camera has a tag attached saying that the software must be installed before plugging in the camera. The software installation takes quite a while to finish.Why do I need to install anything? I am using Microsoft Windows Vista with a Microsoft camera which claims to work great with Vista.Please, whoever is in charge of this product at Microsoft, buy a Mac and plug in an iSight camera. There is no disk in the iSight box.When you control the operating system and the hardware, you can do this.Otherwise, the video seems to work well with Skype, which is why I needed a camera.I specifically looked on the shelf for one that said it works with Vista and not ""designed for XP""."
1,don't go by the looks.,"my friends had used this cam before and they were not quite satisfied with the product. I thought of still giving it a try. Eventually, it didn't meet my expectation. I am not happy with this product. The images are not good and when connecting to Yahoo the cam fails to work most of the time. Video chat is a distant dream on this cam with yahoo messenger. Word of advice: dont go for this cam."
3,Webcam,"Basic Webcam. Installed well and works fine. It is no Technacolor wiz bang gizmo. This baby is basic and that is about it. The sound is good though. Price point is good, so overall, a good product!"
3,A decent webcam,"When I originally installed this product, it would not work. The software and drivers would load correctly, but the computer would never connect to the camera, even though it recognized that there was a VX-3000 webcam attached. Many other reviewers had this problem. The solution is on microsoft's support site for this product: if you have previously installed webcam drivers for a Logitech cam, this camera might not work unless you uninstall the Logitech drivers first. This solved the problem for me. Now that I can use my camera, though, I can say that the quality is not as good as the cams that are integrated in the iBooks. The image quality is decent if you stay still, but it gets choppy when you move around."
4,Plug & Play - works fine,This camera worked great right out of the box. It's a USB connection so it's plug & play. We use it for Skype video calls to Europe. A good buy.
3,Get's the job done,"This Webcam doesn't really do high quality, but for the price, it works. I have had some trouble with it working with Google Video Chat - sometimes it freezes my computer."
4,Microsoft Life Cam,I bought the Microsoft Life Cam while my husband was in Iraq so that I could communicate for free. It has been such a blessing. We have been able to talk or video chat every day through Skype! The picture quality was much better than another camera he bought for himself.
1,dissatisfied so far !,This product offers no help in installation - no phone support number - no way to get help get it running ! We are very disappointed.
3,"Video call feature is awesome, but the mic doesn't work good enough for voice-to-text","Bought this and 3 others for family, the kids think its great to see g'pa and nana on the computer. Beware, the software/drivers conflicted with my Creative Zen. My computer would no longer recognize when it was docked and I lost the ability to charge and sync. After re-installation of my Zen software, all seems to be better now; although it still wants to resync all the old videos, etc and then I get errors that its already on my Zen, or that the file cannot be found.Overall, nice to have a camera for the calls, I wish the resolution was better though."
2,Beware the dot,"I have 3 different webcams and picture quality of this cam is very good. It can capture very smooth 30 FPS video with 640x480 resolution which my other webcams can't seem to do as well as this unit. Color can be adjusted to be vibrant, and it also works well in low light. The option to choose indoor or outdoor is excellent.The biggest problem I have is there is a dot on the capture which looks like a bad pixel on LCD screen. Cleaning of the lense does not help this, so it seems to be internal defect. The first one of these I had had the dot showing on off center to the upper right. I exchanged the unit through Amazon, and the second one again had this dot but this time on lower right. So this defect seems to be a common problem with this product."
4,Good webcam for broadband connection,I bought this camera after looking at specifications. I liked this camera very much. Espiecially with the Skype video chatting the streaming is excellent. I was talking to my parents in india and literally I felt as if they are with me right in US. I love the streaming and the quality of the video. I cannot suggest this webcam if your using dailup connection. Do research on how well it will work for other internet connectivities.
2,Good video; horrible mic,"I bought this camera for the price and based on the positive reviews on Amazon, which is why I now have to post a negative review, so as to save someone from my fate.The video output on this camera is great, and I was surprised at the quality of even captured video recordings using it. The camera also has a face-tracking software function that is neato.However, the microphone is terrible. From the first day I tried to speak on Skype with a friend, the friend told me she could hear a (loud) buzzing sound that made it hard to hear me at all. Unplugging my laptop from its power supply seemed to help some initially.I've tried recording a sound sample with the camera, and the buzzing is there.Google ""Microsoft Lifecam microphone noise"" and you will find this is not an isolated issue."
2,Bad product,"I am returning this webcam to Amazon since the image is horrible. I used all the features available but the image did not get better. Other than that the microphone and the software work just fine.In order to ensure that the problem was not my computer I bought a Logitech today and the image was excelent! Do not buy this one, buy one of the logitech webcams. Mine is a Logitech QuickCamCommunicate STX and I am very happy with it..."
1,Video good - audio has hum,Just purchased and configured the cam. Configuration was more laborious that it should be but it worked.The camera is fine but the microphone picks up a distinct and annoying hum when the camera is active. I am returning this item and do not recommend purchasing it if you plan to use the microphone and camera at the same time.This defect is written up in usenet and elsewhere - so I suspect another camera of this model would have the same problem. The video circuitry must be generating interference to the audio circuitry.
2,"Easy Install, Lousy Product","The low price was the main driver behind my decision to purchase this product. However, once I got it installed I was less than impressed with the ""crystal clear"" audio that the box claimed the camera had. The sound was muddled and the volume control had to be cranked up to the maximum in order for it to pick up my voice.Also, any attempt to optimize the settings really dragged down performance. Audio and video quickly became out of synch. I thought I was watching an old Godzilla movie.So why the two stars in my rating? Cute snowflakes and other graphics to animate the video. However, that didn't cut it and I returned this in exchange for a Logitech product which has been fantastic. Spend another $15 and you can find something better."
5,"High quality, low price",Yup. That pretty much covers it.I use it for Skype and it works brilliantly.
4,Good camera,"If you are using VISTA and Yahoo messenger, the Video CAM will not work (software issue w/ yahoo messenger). Did not try with MS Live. So don't expect video chat btw a XP and Vista machine. Good price point for what's included. PC to PC chats was fine, but couldn't check video to video quality as one of us was using VISTA.Pros:-Automatic face tracking and focus-good sound qualityCons:-grainy picture/video quality-not true colors-I don't expect video quality like the recent CDW commercials with the guy teleconferecing from an island."
4,Nice Camera!,"This is my first camera that I ever purchased with built in sound, and all I can say what is WOW! It clips perfectly to my flat monitor and plus adjusting it is a breeze too. In addition, the picture quality is great and I do have a vista so if you're worried about how the hardware will work, it turned out well. As well it's convenient for IM services especially Windows Messenger, Yahoo, and Skype the main ones I use anyways. The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars because the effects are limited -- so if you're a youtube participator hang grip to your windows movie maker or other effectual software to give your videos creativity. Outside of that it is an overall a great purchase and you won't be disappointed!"
4,Better Quality than some at an okay price!,"Not terribly expensive, which is a plus. Bought this one in particular for my in-laws after seeing how nice the picture quality was during Skype calls with my parents and grandparents having gotten them each the same camera at a brick and mortar store. While those others had improved picture quality very much, the one for my in-laws not so much. It is better than their last camera, but not as good as the others of this same make and model. This could be related to internet connections, but as I'm unable to test this I can't really say. Two out of three with great picture quality isn't bad; especially when I can't be certain that the third is the fault of the camera itself."
3,"Grainy, but good for the price",Picture is quite grainy. Wich I would have spent more money on a better web camera. The effects are fun though
4,Looks like it's working as it should,"Haven't really used it, but it seems to be working well. Install was a piece of cake. It also has a few cool features and settings you can play around with.All in all it's a basic webcamera with everything you need."
3,Great camera - worthless software,"The camera works great - especially for the price. Don't waste time with the installation software on a computer running Windows 7 Home Premium. Even the microsoft website does not have the answer. If you are running a video messenger service - Hotmail, Windows Messenger or Ovoo - just plug in the camera and go. No one seemed to have an answer to the driver instalation error so save the headache and use the messaging service and windows automatic hardware installation to do the job. Again, the cameras works great for the price."
1,Picture Quality is awful,I purchased this on Amazon all other features looks ok except picture quality.....it's horrible....My 3 year old daughter didn't recongnized me on skype.....I was shocked with such poor picture Quality from MS...
4,good cam for price,"Ive had my cam nor for about 2yrs, it still works perfectly fine. This is the first cam ive ever purchased so i was very pleased with the pic/video quality and sound. However the software is basic and not really fun. I wanted a timer for the picture taking and there isnt one. I had to download outside software to get more animations and the timer. But other than its a good first start."
2,Microsoft LifeCam VX-3000,"Microsoft LifeCam VX-3000 was purchased for my mother in an attempt to ""keep an eye"" on her during times where she is ill. Though in the beginning it worked well, it has recently started making a lot of noise. She needs to kind of hit it to make it stop having the ""static"" or ""high pitched"" noise that the person on the other end hears. I was quite disappointed that this camera didn't meet up to my expectations."
2,Not Vista X64 compatible - not even with 1.3 drivers,"Pretty good webcam on XP, but will not work on Vista X64 (64-bit) version, despite what Microsoft claim. Widespread issues with 64 bit vista can be found on the Internet, and no response from Microsoft on the issue. Problem is going on so long now, that one has to doubt that Microsoft are going to fix this. Hopefully 1.4 or later of the drivers will resolve the issue."
4,LifeCam VX-3000 - review,Good camera. Easy setup and it works well with Skype. Little pricey though.
1,Pretty bad.,"Other than the design there is nothing positive about this camera. It interfered so badly with my XP-based laptop that I ended re-installing the operating system. I then tried it on my Vista-based PC. Windows Vista is not able to find the appropriate driver so that you have to go to the Microsoft website and find the driver yourself (which is not a big deal, but it is surprising considering the OS and the webcam are both made by Microsoft). In any case, when I tried to use this camera with Skype it caused trouble, as well (even after I disabled the integrated mic): Every 5-10 minutes I would either stop hearing the other party or the other party would stop hearing me forcing me to go and make necessary adjustments.The admittedly nice design is not enough to give it a 2-star review. I am certain there are fixes to all of the above issues (and others, too), but only after spending a lot of time finding help in online fora, which cannot be the purpose."
1,Video good. Audio has hum noise,"I am returning this item. Users cannot hear me over the consistent hum. I tried varying the mic level and the speaker level in case noise was caused by some sort of feedback. Tried moving to a quieter room, even turning the mic volume completely off. The noise level was still almost halfway up on the input volume indicator! I'm an IT professional and it is obvious to me that this unit is defective."
3,Well...,"So I bought this as a gift to my boyfriend to use for Skype. That's the only thing we use it for, it serves its purpose but I'm not all the impressed. The quality is ok, Mic is always Chopping, having a normal convo is hard to do. The price was right but next time I will pay a little bit more for a better WEBCAM."
4,Great camera,"Does really well, some people on the other end complain that we are blurry sometimes. But we can usually fix that by fiddling with the focus. We enjoy it."
3,Nice camera,Bought this for my sister and everything works great. Have had no problems and the software it comes with was easy and quick to install.
4,picture,"I bought this for my granddaughter so that I could see my great-grandson while we are in Florida and far away from them. The picture is not great, and the sound lags at times."
4,Okay camera,"This is an okay camera. It took me a while to figure out that it has a manual focus lens, which you twist to set at different distances. This is okay, b\c you can always get it to focus where you need it, but a hassle at the same time. It comes with lots of bloatware... if you are into that (the extra options), then this is a plus.Decent camera, does what I need. Stand is pretty versatile."
4,Works as it should,"If you want a simple camera with good image quality, this is the one to get. For basic stuff, you can't go wrong."
2,Poor picture quality video camera,"Camera works fine and is not complicated to install but the picture quality is very poor even sitting less than a foot away from the ""eye."" You must be about six inches away for the picture to be clear."
3,"Okay camera, bad software",The camera works fairly well but I tried the software on two different PC's running XP and it froze on both of them. Next time I will spend a little more and get a Logitech product.
4,great little camera,"I bought this web cam on the advice of my brother-in-law. The set up was easy, even an old guy like me can do it. The only problem I encountered was with my internal mic. It was feeding back and causing a nasty humm. I finally located where to turn it off and the problem was solved. The Microsoft Lifecam vx-3000 is a great little camera and is fun to use, liked it so much I bought 2. thank youMicrosoft LifeCam VX-3000 (68A-00001)"
5,Great Web Cam,"I wanted to have a web cam to use with our grandchildren. This was easy to install and very easy to use. All of our grandchilden can use this cam with ease. They range from age of 5-9 and have no problems placing calls. It certainly makes it nice to be able to not only talk with the grandchildren, but to see them. It has great sound and good pictures. Great for the price."
2,lifecam,"for the price its ok, nothing special. is very grainy and real light sensitive. not the best quality in the world. i will just have to pay more the next one i buy to get a better quality. but suited the need for the time being. amazon is great though for timeliness"
4,VX3000 Lifecam,"I found the VX3000 lifecam camera very acceptable. The picture quality is very good when viewing the picture in small to meadom sizes. When viewing full screen the quality is not the best..The picture is somewhat blurry. This occurs when I send my video to my friend and when he sends his video back to me. He also uses the VX3000 and his opinion is the same as mine...My guees would be that the VX6000 would improve this minor fault. For the price of the VX3000, overall is well worth the money...In addition, the microphone works exceptionally well. I normally sit 30 inches away from the camera and when I get up to go accros the room approx. 12 feet away, my friend can still hear me acceptably. Good overall value."
3,Pretty good for the money.,"The mic is not the best but overall the camera is adequate. The software it uses to capture video and upload is bad, the audio and video don't match. I use movie maker and it is fine."
5,Works Great,"This webcam works great and the price from Amazon was very good. The full motion video isn't choppy like other webcams. When I'm on a video call, I frequently get asked what unit I have since it works so good. One person ran out and bought the same unit right after he called me!Installation was easy and I mainly use it on Skype calls. It also works good in low light. I have found a lower price when electronic stores have some special sales, but the convenience of ordering online, receiving it at my door in a few days, and not having to drive all over to find one... was great."
3,Decent Item,"Having issues of freezing up when useing with instant messengers, otherwise great buy for the money."
4,Nice Cam for Price,"Haven't used it a lot yet, but when I have used it, very clear picture. Very easy to install, plug and play worked fine. Was up and running in less than 10 min. Mic works well also. Only reason I couldn't give it 5 stars was that it wasn't auto-focus. Other than that, great web cam for the few bucks you will spend."
1,NOT FOR LAPTOPS,"I just received this item and was very disappointed that the clip is not made for laptops. When I did the search thru Amazon ""web cams for laptops"" this item comes up first. I cannot speak to the quality or performance but I hope this helps someone else not make the same mistake."
1,installation process not clear,It is a good product once you figure out how to make the camera work. We could not focus the camera for one month. We were about to return it when finally by twisting the lens we made it work. I think the instructions should say something about it.
1,Horrible,"The picture quality of this webcam is horrible! Worst one I have owned yet. If you want high clear quality, do NOT buy this!!"
3,Decent,"This product was affordable, yes, but very unreliable. I used AIM, and was often told about my bad picture quality. It rarely worked (with AIM), and most annoyingly was that the microphone always caused problems. I had to keep going back to the set-up to adjust the microphone so it could pick up my voice, and it was only about 6 inches away...It may work fine with other video sharing messangers, but if you are an AIM user, this webcam is probably not for you. the only good thing was that it had nice face tracking, so I could take photos, but my personal main intrest was to vidchat.The installation also took forever!"
4,Works Great,This camera works wonderful! Picture and sound quality are good. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is the software is loaded with Windows Messenger. This is easy to remove if you prefer to use Skype or other ways to video chat. Would recommend this product.
1,Don't waste your money on this webcam.,"Audio has loud low frequency hum that overpowers your voice on recordings. I installed the unit on 2 different PC's, tried it with XP, Vista and Windows 7. Same result on all.The video works, but the audio is completely worthless. Guess I got what I paid for."
4,Good cam for decent price,I bought this cam to replace my existing philips webcam which had a blurry image and disturbing voice. LifeCam has a good and attractive design which can angled in any direction. It has got good picture quality and voice is also good. Happy to replace the existing one with this one.
2,"poor quality, get something else","Honestly, read the fine print before you buy this cam. It has very poor resolution and if you have a dsl or cable internet connection (or better), you will be frustrated by how blurry the video quality is. On top of that, this product is poorly supported in Windows Vista, and appears to have compatibility problems with video chat software - sound problems with windows messenger, did not work with google video chat, etc. we got it to work most of the time in skype, but the quality is so bad we are returning it for a logitech. try 1.3megapixels or better."
4,web cam,I have used this Microsoft Life Cam and it has good clarity and focus. So far so good. It was easy to install and get going.
4,Works well,"We purchased this camera to work with our Electronic Health Records software in the office, Compulink, and it has worked very well. Install was also very easy."
4,Affordable + good quality,This is a very affordable camera and works well with Skype. I only use it for Skype and have had no issues using it at all.
3,Microsoft Webcam,It works fine. If your monitor doesn't have a cam this is a good buy. Very easy to install and works fine with Skype. I have Windows 7.
2,Microsoft LifeCam VX-3000,"Seldom use this webcam, picture and sound system is not too good.Next time I buy a computer I'll get the one that has a build inwebcam."
1,Awful quality.,"The quality of this camera is abysmal at best. Seriously, it may be some of the worst quality I have EVER seen out of a webcam. And if you are planning on low light situations, just throw in the towel. Returned this the very next day after purchase."
4,Value for money,"This is my first web camera, and I can i say that its has been my value for money purchase.I find the picture quality and sound quality good and the very easy to install and use. However I find it little dipsy-dopsy when I place it on my laptop. I wish the Microsoft comes up with a better holder for this webcam.Overall a great product and works well with any video chat software."
5,Microsoft LifeCam VX-3000 (68A-00001),I have really enjoyed my webcam. My sister lives in another state and now we can visit face to face. It's great! I love it!Mrs. J. Long
4,Functions as advertised but not exciting.,"The Microsoft LifeCam VX-3000 does exactly what it is supposed to. The size is nice as it is very small and does not get in my way. It has a hard time with bright backgrounds, and it also has a hard time when it is dark in the room. It is fine in normal lighting conditions. I now see the importance of HD, as this doesn't have it. I also now see the importance and benefits of having HD, autofocus, wide angle lenses, and digital mic. However, for the price, this LifeCam VX-3000 is fine. I wanted it as an entry-level learners cam, and it has been perfect at doing that!"
4,Good Camera Good Price,It did what I needed it for. The effects are fun to toy around with. The stand effectively sits where you put it. The color and sound are good.
5,Works great,"I bought this camera for my daughter-in-law, so I can see my granddaughter when she's born. I chose this model because I bought one eight months ago, and mine works just fine. I use it weekly on Skype for a group meeting, and no one ever complains that they can't hear me which happens for some of the others. I use it as a microphone, mostly, but the video has been fine when I used it."
4,Great for video clips... just ok for chatting.,"The picture is crystal clear, but the exta stuff (face follower, animated extras,etc) do not work with Yahoo chat. I think that stuff only works if you are making a video clip."
4,Microsoft LifeCam VX-3000,"works great.. neat features, excellent price and better than the Labtec i used to have"
1,MS strikes again,"I bought the Logictech 910 here and didn't like it much but not enough to complain.So also bought this MS LifeCam here on Amazon. It was cheap enough for me to not care if I get a refund or not.I was excited about it, but found that it would not even work unless I used the enclosed CD to install the necessary software and then it wouldn't work unless I at least installed ""Life Essentials 2011"" and I was tricked, then, into installing other junk, but safely ignored stuff I knew I didn't want.I don't care about a refund. I threw away the packing box and it is too much trouble.I buy lots stuff from Amazon and will continue but I will be VERY reluctant to buy any MS stuff.The Web cam forces you to use MS stuff you won't want.Beware.Karl Loren"
1,Cheap and outdated!,"There is nothing in the description for this item regarding the resolution or size...I guess I should have taken this as my first clue NOT to purchase it. It's a 1.3 MP camera w/only 640x420. I'm not sure if this is exact, but it's very close to the size from what I remember...I can't tell you exactly because I've already repackaged the item after only receiving it a couple of hours ago.None of the actual specs are listed on the listing...and if I would have taken the time to read the reviews I would have seen that only very young people and people illiterate to computer use actually gave it decent ratings. And a bunch of people gave it 5 stars after saying in their ACTUAL review that the webcam was ""ok"" or ""functional"". Why are you people rating it 5 stars when it's only ""functional""??? This is a VERY cheap cam, and no one should pay more than 5 bucks for it in my opinion.I'm going elsewhere, to a product that actually has the specs listed so I know what I'm buying."
4,Cheap camera - It does the job.,"I used to have one of these when the product was initially released by Microsoft. At the time there were no HD webcam's yet. I recall paying a lot of money for it back then, and then donating it 2 years ago to a family member. So this time I got another one waaay cheaper for basic Skype usage. I gotta say it works great, and my kids love the Microsoft Lifecam software that 'changes your appearance' :-) If you want a solid, but very basic webcam then I suggest this guy. If you are looking for high quality video, then you may want to look elsewhere."
3,microsoft webcam,"Good price. Delivered in a timely manner, in perfect condition. Requires use in very bright light, as there is no manual light adjustment. The sound is decent. Overall, worth the price."
4,LifeCam Reveiw,I got this webcam to talk to my friend who left for college. Everything except picture quality is decent.
5,VX-3000,received it on time and love the video call features plus the video effects... p.s. you should buy this web camera...
4,A good webcam for less price,"This a very good webcam, and mic is included too. The quality of picture is nice. The lens can be rotated easily to adjust to your need. My earlier one, Logitech Quickcam, which was of less megapixels and which I purcahsed two years ago, the picture quality was not so good.The only thing I did not like is: the Windows messenger Live call button on top of the webcam, as we use mostly Yahoo and Skype. The button should have been customizable. Additionally, since it is on the top, whenever you try to tilt the webcam up or down, you mostly click this button my mistake, which open the Live Call window of Microsoft."
2,WebCam,Ordered two webcams as a gift for my husband and could not activate the sound on either one. No trouble shooting instructions on package directions.
4,does the job- clip a little hard to use,"This product does the webcam job well, and has some fun icons and animations that you can oeprate during your chat. Very easy software to install. The only downside is the clip, which doesn't grip well on the edge of my laptop, so sometimes it falls off or is lopsided... but it's an ok product for the money."
2,annoying feature,"This issue I have with the Microsoft camera applies to the entire LifeCam series. I use this webcam for my notebook and on Skype only. There's a big button on the top of the camera, that spot happens to be the exact place where you would put your finger (and the thumb on the bottom) to adjust the tilt of the camera. Since you can only adjust the angle of the camera while it's plugged into your computer, everytime you push that button while plugged into the computer it asks you if you want to install some sort of Microsoft software(feature). It really gets on your nerves since I take the camera off when not in use and everytime I turn it on I have to deal with this annoying button. I don't like how Microsoft is using this tactic to push their product down our throats. Otherwise the camera part of it seems to work fine."
1,"Software doesn't work, can't connect microphone",I've had this for about 6 months. I really regret purchasing it. The software that is supposed to run it is a total POS. despite several attempts I have never been able to get the microphone to work AT ALL. I'm on windows 7 64 bit. maybe it works with XP or vista?it shouldn't take 10 tries to get a microphone recognized. and if microsoft is going to push 64 bit machines they should make their OWN PRODUCTS work with them. Their support is totally useless.I'm sure there are much better cameras out there that are plug and play
2,poor product,Very poor product! not at all worth the money that I paid for it..and if I could ..I would send it back!
2,Dissapointed,This product did not live up to the advertised hype. I installed it on a laptop and the picture was poor quality. I then installed it on a desk top with the same results. One using Windows Vista and the other using Windows XP Pro.I expedted a great deal more from Microsoft.
1,Awful Product,"This is an awful product. While chatting over, the person on the other side would have a hard time distinguishing you from your dog. The microphone works well in comparison to the picture quality. But when you compare it with other descent webcams, it fails miserably. If your mic is even somewhere near your speakers, it produces a very bad interference.To sum up, I will just say, I have already ordered a return receipt from amazon, after using the webcam for not even a week."
1,Don't Buy This!,"It worked for a while but suddenly when I wanted to make a video I would get ""initializing error"" in safe mode. It said I had to change the resolution settings but there was no way to access the dash board. I have uninstalled 3 times with no success! The camera works but I have to access it from my computer and I can use it only to take stills. The mic never worked because you would have to get up close to the camera to be heard! It is typical Microsoft garbage. I hear Logitech is good and inexpensive too!"
1,Ugh doesn't work with Mac,"So I should have thought about it - of course a MS product would not play well with a Mac. So rather than return it for a measly $27.00 refund (hardly worth the effort to go to the post office and rebox it, etc.) - it sits somewhere in the hall closet waiting to find a use."
3,"OK Lifecam, but Nothing to Brag About!!","I bought the Microsoft LifeCam VX-3000 because my son said it was the best way to see my new grandson on my computer, by using the Lifecam in conjunction with Skype. The set-up was confusing, and I had to call my son on the phone to walk me though it. Still, we had problems and it was a good half hour before we finally got it to work properly.The unit is fairly inexpensive, and you usually get what you pay for. If I had to do it all over again, I'd spend more money and get a better unit."
2,Terrible picture quality,"The camera itself is just ok. I ordered it because it was the vx-3000 vs the vx-2000 I could get at my local walmart for the same price. The picture quality is terrible though, I might as well skype with no picture."
3,Pretty good,I do a lot of skyping..and it's not so great for that. My built in laptop camera is better. but this external camera does better on the sound and it has only not worked once. Dependable i guess you could say.haha.
2,Wasted dollars,Video delays are horrendous! There is a disconcerting lack of sync between the audio and video. Similar to a 1970's Japanese over-dub movie. Don't buy it!
2,Crummy Video Quality,"This is probably fine for having video chat calls with your long-distance girlfriend, but the resolution was so poor, with very few options for sharpening, that I had repackaged it for return with an hour of opening the box. Grainy and rough."
1,Not As Good As The LifeCams of Old,"I've used an older lifecam for the last few years with no problems whatsoever but this one ain't all that great. The software doesn't seem to work that well with Skype. Almost every video conversation I had using this camera froze up at some point. Even after reinstalling the software the problems persisted. The picture was somewhat improved over cameras of old, but what's the point if it freezes up all the time? I can't recommend this camera at all. Maybe the higher-level stuff from Microsoft is better (and perhaps this product is meant to push you in that direction) but I'm going with an HP camera from here on out."
2,"fine hardware, TERRIBLE software","Picture quality good, sound quality okay, but the driver software totally destabilized my Windows XP system. Everything slowed down- mysterous 10 second delays started. Trying to log out or reboot would pop up windows saying that a ""CameraMonitor"" process was refusing to die. I un-installed the software from the control panel, but the problems remained. I had to dig around in the registry to find the stuff it installed in the auto-run keys and remove them by hand to make it really go away. Then everything got 100% better instantly. It clearly was this camera's software. I'm returning it."
3,Microsoft LifeCam VX-3000,"Pros: Nice face tracking, good capture angle, good video quality, good built-in mic, mountable on laptopCons: Special effects do not work with Skype(but the cam works very fine with Skype), one touch button is not configurable.It has an one touch button on the top when you press it opens MSN messenger(or asks you to install it if you don't have it). I keep on pressing that button by mistake when I try to adjust the cam. I did not find a way to change the one touch settings. This is the only reason it did not give it a four star. The driver software comes with lot of cool effects which work only with MSN messenger. It has an average low light performance which I think is okay(it's not a camcorder right?)."
3,Could be better,The biggest complaint is picture quality! I've tried everything and it still looks blurred. The sound from mic is great and picks up voices real good. Still not bad for 20.00 dollars. Still haven't decided to send back or keep?????
4,Excellent inexpensive Web cam,"Bought this web cam to use it with skype on my Windows 7 computer. Installation was easy and it does the job just fine... it's hardly high quality but I use it to chat with my kid who is in Europe for a semester abroad and it works exactly as I need it to. If you are looking for a cheap quick solution, I would recommend this Web cam."
4,Great cam for the price,"It's not top of the line and it's not HD quality, but for the low price, it does a great job. I have a VX-1000 and this one was for my wife, there is defiantly a difference in video quality.If your looking for a cam to chat with friends or family, you can't go wrong with this one."
4,Microsoft Web-Cam,"We had difficulty initially setting up the web-cam, perhaps as we're not all that computer literate. But finally we succeeded and it is now working fine."
2,Not the Greatest,"The drivers that come with it don't work on Vista, so I had to search for an upgraded driver, which was quite a pain. I eventually found one that did work on Microsoft. The description says it will work with Vista, and technically, I suppose it does, but it does not with what is originally packed in the box."
4,Trouble free and really works,This is the second one of these I have bought for another location as it really is easy to install and use -I wish all such products were the same.
3,VX3000,"Camera works OK, Install was easy and problem free, however the built in microphone does not work very well and the software appears that it was designed for elementary school students. To use this for IM I will most likely need to get a headset w/mic, but for $26.00 + free shipping I got what I paid for."
5,GREAT DEAL,I AM VERY PLEASED WITH MY MOCROSOFT LIFECAM. I HAVE NEVER HAD ONE BEFORE AND WAS SURPRISED WITH THE PICTURE AND VOICE QUALITY FOR THE PRICE. IT IS SO SIMPLE TO INSTALL AND I AM ENJOYING IT EVERY DAY. I HIGHLY RECOMEND THIS PRODUCT. I LOVE IT!!!
3,Microsoft LifeCam VX-3000 Purchase,Performance is okDrivers inside the product CD is not compatible with Windows Vista.Image quality is good.
1,Do not buy this camera!,"I bought three of these cameras and the audio stopped working a week, the other two shortly. All of them stopped working the microphone. I do not recommend. Do not buy this camera!"
3,Cheap product and corresponding quality.,"Picture is rather good, but problems with noises and sound are exactly as it is in previous reviews.The only way to fix problem was to buy a microphone and to disable sound in the camera."
4,good cam for the price,Video quality is good. Works well with instant messaging. I like the zoom pan and face tracking features at my fingertips(mouse). Very easy setup.Only complaint is the main screen is large and cant view the whole window. Cant seem to make smaller. I can drag it but it returns to the original position as soon as I unclick the mouse. The only real solution I found is to hide the taskbar at the bottom of screen to allow more room the cam window.
2,anyone getting a buzzing sound on the recepient's end?,"I just purchased this web cam last week, and I like it so far, but for some reason there is a loud buzzing sound on his end. Anyone know why?"
3,Its ok...,"This is ok, nothing really wow me. It works with my skype.But after you install in XP, and I always unplug after use, after you reboot, there are like 2 pop ups which reminds you how to re-plug into your USB slot.. just very annoying.Also, I got this for my laptop, and I find the cables attach to the camera is too long. I guess this is for a desktop.If, I have to buy again, I would get one thats dont have a wire.GL and enjoy."
5,Great Webcam,"I love this webcam, great resolution.I'm using it to talk with my husband in Iraq and I'm super satisfied with my purchase."
4,Satisfied,"I am pretty satisfied with this camera, but it seems to adjust to different light levels in a less than ideal fashion."
4,Great!,"This is a great webcam. Using it to talk overseas to my stepdaughter. Great sound, great picture"
4,Great Web Cam for the Price,"Needed a quality web cam at an affordable price. The Microsoft LifeCam VX-3000 fits the bill nicely. I bought it specifically to be able to communicate with family overseas. It's not as good as being there, but pretty close. Works great with the Vista operating system. The only downside I can see is that it doesn't like to stay put on top of my flat-panel monitor. I think that is partially due to the fact that the USB cable could stand to be a little longer. But, all in all, it does the job and I'm not out a whole lot of $$."
5,Sure beats the phone.,This camera has good resolution and will go full screen on the received video. Smooth most of the time on a 3MB DSL connection. Easy install and free web account setup.
3,"cheap, easy but foggy picture","It was inexpensive, easy to settup (though finding the MS link for the updated drivers was tough) and attractive but the picture quality leaves alot to be desired.I got what I paid for"
5,Haven't used it.,"bought this for the old laptop, the new one has a built in camera. I'm sure this one is great too. Guess I'll find out some day."
1,It most likely will not work properly,"It seems like quite a bit of other people are having this problem. For some reason every time I want to use it I have to unplug it then plug it back in. I tried downloading the latest software for the camera from Microsoft because the disc that comes with it is outdated,(that's what happens when you buy things from Amazon that sit in a warehouse for months) but that did not solve the problem. It has great video quality though. awesome camera if you don't mind getting annoyed every time you try to use it.Basically don't waste your time like I did."
1,Terrible Buzzing Sound,"It worked alright at first, but if you check online you see a lot of users report a problem with a loud buzzing sound that usually begins after the first few months. That happened to me. Now when I Skype or try to record something, I hear a loud buzzing that didn't used to be there. You cannot change volume settings to remove it."
2,Web Cam,"The web cams is alright, picture quality is good, and does what youd expect for the price . Feel that i should not have the microsoft one though, they always want to force you to only use microsoft products. Foreinstance the quick launch button on the cam only works with messanger, and its in such a position on the cam that you always keep pushing it, and then you get a warning message as i dont use messanger. Really anoying. Have also had complaints from other people i chat to that there is a background humming over their speakers if i plug in the web cam while chatting. Spend a bit more and get another make."
4,Works for a First Webcam,"I purchased this webcam for two friends of mine.I set both webcams up for them and had very little problems without being particularly techno-savvy. Software was an easy set up on my friend's laptop and the attachment is a little flimsy, but definitely workable. The most significant problem was when I tried to set it up on my friend's desktop, the attachment was no problem, but there was interference with software and the external speakers she had on. If you have external speakers be sure to turn them off before trying to complete installation! It will save a lot of confusion and headaches!Since this is also a Microsoft product it defaults to MSN Messenger (or whatever the new name is for it). From personal experience, I've found it easiest to work with this program when wanting to use the webcam for chats. Unless you're dead-set on using another chat program, I would just stick with MSN Messenger.Hope this helps! Good luck!"
5,Best deal for a webcam!!!,"Excelent webcam for the lowest price.Good pictures (1.3MP), easy to use. I love the video effects and the automatic face tracking.The software in the box, Microsoft LifeCam 1.4 didn`t work with windows 7, but windows update download a compatible version (3.0.215).My daughter love it."
5,This camea is a good product. Get one for yourself.,This camea is a good product. Get one for yourself. We use them in about 60 or 70 of our offices and they have all been great from installation to utilization.
3,Pretty Good for the Price,I bought this camera so I could skype my folks back home. It actually turned out working perfectly except the clarity isn't the best.
4,"easy to set up, easy to use",I purchased this to replace a Logitech in which the Microphone failed. Windows 7 installed this in moments and picture and sound have been great.
4,Great webcam for the price!!,"This webcam isn't anything super fancy, but it works great for Skype and basic video projects. I could not justify buying anything more pricey."
5,Great purchase,I'm completely satisfied with the camera. I purchased a total of 6 cameras for my siblings who are located throughout the United States and all of the cameras have been working great. I also purchased the Life Cam-6000 and found that it was not worth the money. We use the Skype software with the cameras and the 3000 works great. I would suggest the 3000 over the 6000 if you are using the camera for simple on-line calls.
1,Problems with Vista,Installing driver from CD causes Vista Home Premium 32-bit to hang repeatedly (blue screen) once the USB is plugged in and subsequent OS crash even when not plugged in. Searching found many had problems with Vista. Found no useful help on Microsoft support site. Had to do system restore to prior state (uninstall crashed OS). Returned it.
4,Great device!,"My daughter and husband spend countless hours chatting away and playing games with this device! It was easy to set up and works great! The only downside is the quality of the image. If you enlarge the image (so it takes up the whole screen), it's a bit distorted. The regular size is a bit small, but we can still see one another. There is a newer model and I suppose the quality of the image might be better. Overall, it's a great product and I'm glad we got it!"
4,Works better than my last cam!,"The microsoft life cam works much better than my last webcam, a logitech cam which cost about 3 times as much. The software install was flawless and i have yet to have an issue with the cam. I would have liked to have had a privacy shade and wish the focus would be a little more sharp, but overall I am highly satisfied with this product."
3,"Far from ""crystal clear""","I purchased this cam as a compromise over the Logitech C600 which is much more expensive. This is definitely a case of ""you get what you pay for"". The description of the image quality touts ""crystal clarity"". Nope. The second I fired this thing up what I got was a blurry soft focus image with no ability to sharpen it outside of the ""sharpen"" feature in the UI which simply allows pixel crunching like in photoshop. I guess the short story is that I'm disappointed. I will be returning this as soon as possible and dropping the extra bucks on the C600 as soon as I can."
5,works great!,"I liked it so much, I ordered one for my mother-in-law so she too could skype! Great way to stay in touch with grandchildren!"
4,nice for the price,"This cam does what I bought it to do; allows me to chat with family in other states. Yes, it doesn't do so well in low light, but nothing that can't be fixed by turning on a light or using the low light enhancement feature.One missing feature for most webcams, including this one, a screw on the bottom to attach on a tripod. My one complaint is that it is hard to find a good place to position the camera.. either it's too high and you have a huge forehead or it's too low and everyone is looking up your nose. When you do find a place to position the camera, the base makes the camera fall over, or the the usb cord pulls it out of position."
4,Great Webcam,"The price was right & the quality was exceptional. I have used the camera on several video chat sites with consistently good results. I would have preferred a higher pixel density, but that would have been far more costly. This is an exceptional value."
3,Works ok for Skype only under Windows 2003x64,"None of the features work under Windows Server 2003 x64. It works fine for Skype, which is what I got it for, but the focal length is way too long to sit on a monitor and get a head shot, so the image is very small. Voice is ok.A thoroughly mediocre product. Works well enough for what I needed, but that's all."
4,Great Cam for Video Chat,"It's a pretty good cam, focus and picture quality is quite good. Though the picture is lil' dark during the daylight with direct bright sunlight streaming from windows, otherwise the quality is good in normally lit room in daylight. Go for it."
1,Don't waste your time and money,I returned the piece of $#*&%$ after trying for two weeks to get decent picture quality. In using Skype the picture on the receiving end would either freeze or disappear completely.
3,Video Cam,"The unit was reasonably easy to install, after a couple of hiccups. The quality of the picture is not the best - kind of herky-jerky. But we are pleased overall because it was cost effective and gets the job done. We will upgrade as better products become less expensive."
5,Nice one to have,I have installed in Vista and I did not face any issue reported in many forums. I used it with different chat applications and found the clarity is so good. Best one for the price!!!
4,good deal,"works great. better price than I could have received locally. no problems using any webcam applications. I use it with google video chat, skype, camfrog... u name it."
1,This is NOT free phone service,"Originally I thought this was a phone that would let me use VoIP technology to make free phone calls to anywhere in the world. Wrong! As the italic fineprint on Amazon points out, you must subscribe to a VoIP service plan (e.g., Vonage). These plans are usually quite expensive, and have restrictions as well. Plus the phone itself is so expensive. If you are looking for a free VoIP solution, this is absolutely NOT it.For now, I guess you should stick to a PC VoIP program like Skype or MSN Messenger."
5,Well Done Universe,"This was a purchase for my oldest son, who lives in England. He has always loved Outer Space and grew up with the NASA program of astronauts and satellites. He enjoys Stephen Hawkins.This DVD is well done, graphic quality is great and subject matter is top of the line as well as informative. I plan to purchase the others in this series for him too."
5,Entertaining and Great Looking,"This is the second season of one of the best science programs from the History channel.It presents the science accurately and in detail and gives you an excellent overview of astronomy and cosmology.More importantly, it captures the excitement of scientific discovery better than most science video. You get an inside look at the process of discovery.Get a copy of this series. You will want to watch it again and again."
4,NOT Anamorphic,"First of all, let me start out by saying that this is an excellent collection of documentaries about the universe. However, for those of us with widescreen televisions, we should be aware that this collection, much like season one, is NOT optimized for our widescreen televisions. It is presented in 'Letterbox' format, meaning that on widescreen televisions it will be presented with large black bars on all sides, with the feature occupying a window in the middle of the screen. For those with 4:3 televisions, it will appear as all widescreen features do, but for 16:9 screens it is a major disappointment."
5,wonderful!,"If you THIRST for info on our cosmos and love the RIDE through computer graphics, this is just what you are looking for. Detailed and and beautiful and FUN! The scientists were great. The music gets a little intense for me at times but OH WELL, I wouldnt have missed it. It is amazing to me that we are part of something so vast, and I could see the same amazement in the wonderful scientists that they interviewed!"
2,A far cry from season 1,"Consisted largely of several re-hashed scenes from other shows and Season 1. If Season 1 were 4.5/5.0, Season 2 is 2.5/5.0. I have higher hopes for Season 3."
4,Great series,"Another hit in my eyes. I love all things space and sci-fi and even though some things in here might be wrong or unproven, it is very entertaining and you will learn something from every episode."
1,Yellow Jeans Versace,"This was a total rip-off. The purchase price for this product is RIDICULOUS! I may have read it wrong and the picture is deceiving, because this is truly a miniature size product, NOT worth the $50.00 I paid with shipping cost. Very Disappointed, as this was a birthday gift for my daughter!"
5,Present to the present,A wonderful reminder to set intentions every day and take them with you wherever you go! I definitely needed the structure.Thank you.
3,"great performance, poor recording",The material on this disc is a good mix of set show pieces and other work by a superb band. But the background noise on the recording is pretty high which makes it difficult to listen to properly.
2,"Read ""Mind Hunter"" by John Douglas instead","Investigation techniques described in this story are way behind what was available when this book was written i.e. in the late 1980s in the US. There is no mention in the novel of psychological profiling, a technique which really gloomed in the early 1970s under the leadership of the FBI and was widely used with success by the late 1980s.In fact, it is difficult to imagine that an investigation of a series of over 10 savage murders (18 by the end of the book) would not have involved the FBI in any way or form, not even for technical advice.The basic intrigue about two murderers, one copying the other, is not realistic. It is known in the police world that details of a murder scene are not revealed to media to prevent copycat. There are other inconsistencies in the story. Anyone who has read ""Mind Hunter"" by John Douglas and remembers some of it knows too much about police work to enjoy reading ""Shadow Dancers"".Overall a very average read."
