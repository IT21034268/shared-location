5,THIS CD IS AWESOME!!,This is definitely a GREAT CD! The songs on the cd showcase the talent of these 5 young men both as singers and song writers! Their live performances of these songs only enhances what is already on the cd!
3,Too dense and tense about adoption,"I was trying to understand at what age an adoptee could understand this book, or have the patience to listen to the very intricate explanations as to what it means to be adopted. The child will even have to know who the former presidents Herbert Hoover and Gerald Ford were. I think the authors are trying way too hard to convince the child that adoption is okay. It was hard for me, as an adult, to finish reading the book. Look at Rose Lewis's book, I Love You Like Crazy Cakes, and you see how little needs to be said to enchant the adopted child.Gisela Gasper Fitzgerald, author of ADOPTION: An Open, Semi-Open or Closed Practice?"
4,Book,Interesting book on the life of Hetty Howland Greene. I learned quite a bit that I did not know before.
5,Brilliant and accessible,"As usual, Daniel C. Dennett brings precision to a topic often muddied by wishful thinking, unsupported suppositions and entrenched predisposition. His insights are keen and this book makes a wonderful and accessible introduction to both his books on consciousness (e.g., Consciousness Explained) and his books on evolution (e.g., Darwin's Dangerous Idea)."
3,too slick for my taste,"I like Yellow very much, but their latest, the eye, sounds more like 'elevator music' to me.I prefer the older recordings (flag, one second)"
3,A Good Groove,"Though the competition was fierce, was ever there a sillier new wave group than Yello? Do you really want to split hairs, especially if those hairs include A Flock of Seagulls? Yello - Boris Blank and Dieter Meier - are still at it 24 years later with their 11th release The Eye. Damned if they aren't as goofy and fun as back in the day. Since they'd always posited themselves as more dance than new wave band, they got through the 90's with minimal changes to their original style - whispered vocals, rhythms of the day, a sense of fun that occasionally bordered on desperate. They add a touch more world rhythm on The Eye, and the dulcet vocals of diva Jade Davies on a handful of tracks don't hurt. For eight out of 14 cuts, their groove is preferable to most of the dance factories in the U.S. and Europe. Not bad for the old degenerates."
2,A mediocre return,"Although Yello have been recording for over 20 years now and have a dozen albums to their credit,it's interesting to know that their heyday was clearly in the '80s.Their monumental releases were Stella and One Second,which laid out the blueprint for their technopop sound.Thus ""The Eye"",their latest opus doesn't really have that many surprises.A few reasonable tunes spark up here and there like Unreal,Junior B and Bougainville.Otherwise it sounds pretty much like all their other recordings..The only thing otherwise worth buying this cd for is the cover(one of their best in ages)."
4,Good Learning Tool,"Of course, nothing better than real hands-on equipment on Cisco equipment. However, the best way to use it is not only to do the lab but also to study the other commands and check the Cisco Web site for configurations while doing this e-lab. The ATM portion of the lab. is what you should expect at the CCIE. ISDN is maybe a little different because of the different variations on the authentication methods used (for example, ppp chap hostname and ppp chap password, etc.)I heard a lot of complains about these labs but I did think that Cisco was going in the right direction."
3,COUNTDOWN TO DESTINY,"I liked how the author arranged the chapters, taking the ship across the Atlantic day by day with his reader as a passenger. Of course we don't know much about what happened on board all this time, but the technique is still a good one, gearing us up for the action on day seven.Still, the book was not nearly as gripping as others, and not as well written. The sinking does not come alive, and we are not given as many details or as much information as we deserve."
4,Does the job,"I keep one of these in my tool bag. Simple, passive network and phone continuity tester for use with live networks. Plug into a live outlet to check connectivity and wiring. Will detect breaks and pair polarity, but won't detect swapped or moved pairs (like in an Ethernet cross-connect cable)."
5,Super Overclocking and Stability,One of the most overlooked and yet extremely important components of any computer is a high quality power supply. This PS is of the highest quality and is capable of the most demanding loads that anyone is going to need from a PS. You will not find a better PS than this anywhere for the price that Amazon.com has this one. I am running an overclock AMD CPU with and overclocked Geforce video card and overclocked memory. My cooliong needs require six additional case fans besides the CPU cooling fan and the motherboard chipset cooling fan. This PS is able to handle this load with out one single hiccup. It would be able to power more fans and drives if needed. You will be very satisfied with this unit.
2,warning,"This is not the Bellwether from Minneapolis that plays Uncle Tupelo-style country rock. This Bellwether is from Bloomington, Indiana and plays fairly irritating emocore (here's a hint to the lead singer: screaming incoherently does not make you more ""emotional""). That said, fans of the style should dig it.Again, this is not the alt.country Bellwether!"
3,Enjoyable,"I have never read Robbins before but I enjoyed this book because it was a pleasant, fun and easy read. This is not a book I would read a second time but I would recommend it to anyone who wants to read something that isnt too taxing on the old brain cells."
3,Good Read!,"Reading this book is almost watching a tv-movie. I wouldn't be surprised if they'll turn into one. I enjoy the way it was written, whoever the ghost writer is. I believe that even Mr. Robbins left this idea/plot of the story - It will of course goes down how it was written and the way it came out.3 Stars!Shirley (San Leandro, CA)"
3,"Looks great, functions rather...poorly.","This cute little caster did what the designer wanted for ""looks"", but the actual function leaves a little to be desired."
2,"extends external antenna on router, but signal loss is big","If you are buying this to connect an outside omni directional antennae that has a N-type connector, it is better to by the large cable for the length, and the short version of this one to go from the router to the N-type adapter. So, I don't really have a use for this one just yet."
4,Antenna Extender.,"For those who use wireless internet connections in their homes, this is a must item. It allows you to reposition and/or extend the antenna location to allow for greater range of wireless signal. Connections are standard for most cards and antennas."
5,Gets the job done,"If u need to move your antennae, this gets the job done. I have not seen any signal loss, gold plated connectors are a plus as well"
5,It's an Extension cable for your computers Wireless card antenna,"I know the title is a bit long winded, but if you recently purchased a wireless card which has an antenna on a cord (rather than a stumpy plastic thing built onto it) such as http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M5U9GI/ref=cm_cr_mts_prod_img, then this is exactly the cable you're looking for to allow you to put that antenna further away from your computer so it can get a strong signal."
5,Excellent for moving the antenna,"If you have a router with a wireless setup that uses an screw on antenna, this product will move the antenna so you can get better reception. Caution, many router have internal antennas and can not use this product"
4,Worth the watch,"I picked this up yesterday and took it home putting it into the player as soon as I walked in the door. I ended up watching it 3 times in one day. I laughed so hard. I am 38 and remember his performances from late-night tv and seeing these 2 performances on DVD was so cathartic. I laughed until I cried sometimes. There are outtakes that people have said the sound faded but that's why they were outtakes. If you listen, you will still get the jokes even though they sound fades in and out. Mic's in those days were not as good as today. You can't blame Sam for the equipment."
3,"1/2 is good, other 1/2 bad","It arrived fine, but the content is not that good - the Breaking the Rules is the same as that video, but the other is Sam Kinison playing in a rock band - pretty weak."
5,Simply Perfect,"This camera is simply perfect. The adjustability, ease of use, and battery life are amazing. Shot for a whole day (7a.m. to about 7p.m.) and only while finally downloading the images to my computer (the 250 of them I took) did I get the 'Low Battery' light. It seems to compensate the white balance a lot better than my Sony, and focuses faster than my last Canon SLR (I have a Canon 28-200mm USM lens). It has a big enough buffer to allow you to shoot one after another in single shot mode. In 'burst' mode you may be backed up a bit waiting though. The look of the camera is very 'classy'. The high resolution and ability to have full manual or automatic control make it perfect for amaterus and pros. Could have used a firewire interface for faster download speed (the USB does take a while with the larger size images), but that isn't enough to take away from a 5-Star Rating. I'd give it a 10 if the scale went that high!"
2,The camera is outdated,When I bought the camera I found the screen to be too small and it was really grainy at even it's lowest iso.
3,Think Again!!,"I had just bought this camera, and it is not compatible with any other Canon lens but the eos 10d ones.So either buy a great adapter, or only buy those lenses.It is really heavy, and quite big. It has all the features of the newer models, so don't worry about that. It is quite complicated if you are thinking this to be your first digital SLR.But over all.. it is an awesome camera!!!"
5,WOW!!!,"This camera is everything I desired in a digital camera and so much more. While other kids played baseball and football I grew up with a Pentax MX strapped around my neck. Photography was and is my passion. This camera allows me the expression I always dreamed of. Combined with Adobe Photoshop, this is the best camera/darkroom setup I've ever worked with!"
1,Focus mechanism is a nightmare!,"Lots of trouble getting my million dollar digi to focus. (I got it as a gift dec 03) I have an original rebel, Elan 7E and consider myself pretty experienced with canon. I've never seen anything like this. I am about to give up and go back to film. Shooting small children and weddings are a nightmare with this. I have a bride with lots of well focused flowers and she is out of focus in most picures. Very frustrated."
2,Almost there,"A great camera overall. I thought it would be a great transition from my EOS film camera with EF lenses. But sadly, your lenses WILL NOT work the same way. This is due to the sensor chip not being full-frame (35mm). Had it been, It would have gotten 5 stars. Right now, your lenses are less wide in angle. This really defeats the purpose of it being compatible with EF lenses. Too bad. Canon almost had it for a great consumer camera."
2,There is one major downside,"The 1.6x magnification. How does this work? Do we only see a smaller percentage of the frame, as I suspect, and therfore the resolution should be divided by 1.6 to give a true figues of 3.93 mega pixels. stil good, and all the positive features of the camera should not be overlooked, but it is very limiting. one of my favourite photographic techniques is to take a close up portrait with a wide angle lens. you can get a really interesting subject with a nice background too, but for a 28mm shot with this camera, you need a 17mm lens; for 24mm you need 14mm ... count the extra costs of these lenses (expensive) if you ever want to take a landscape shot again"
3,"Great Camera, one major flaw","I have had this camera for about 6 months. I love digital cameras, but my early sony's were too slow. This camera is very very fast. The detail is incredible. I have taken thousands of photos and rarely have any that are under exposed. probably one in two hundred. This would be even less if I were more competent.The one major short coming I have had with this camera is that it locks up. I will get the display ""PA-A"" and it won't go away. This is generally only displayed when I first turn the camera on and it last only a split second. Othertimes, however, this message pops up in the middle of shoots and locks up the camera. The fix is a quick removal of the battery from its contacts. I have gotten pretty fast at it, but this should never be an issue. I have heard that this is a problem with the new 20D as well. That is not very reassuring."
3,Filled the need,This worked very nicely but it does not tilt or swivel from side to side so it limits my mobility to a certain extent. It is sufficiently sturdy and attractive.
1,Warning! 05 Silverado Chevrolet Trucks,"This book is simply wrong on many details of the 05 Silverado truck.It says there is a 'fuel' filter on the D/S rear chassis rail, there is none!The fuel filter on this model is in the fuel pump assembly inside the fuel tankThe Haynes manual asserts that there is a coolant drain plug on the bottom of the radiator, sorry but again wrong.There is NO coolant drain plug on the radiator of the 05 Silverado Truck, to drain the coolant a bottom hose on the radiator must be disconnected - a very messy job BTW.The book says that there are two coolant drain plugs on the engine block, again wrong. There is only one such plug.This is but a short list, I expect to find many more of these errors in the future.The only thing that is useful about the book is telling the reader about torque settings and other useless data that can be gotten here on the internet for free.The $17 I spent for this item was a total waste of my money, and using it is a total waste of time!"
2,Very Basic,This book is for a novice Keno player. Anyone that has played Keno before would probably not benefit from reading this book.
3,"Trivial information regarding the game KENO; not much valid information regarding winning techniques, etc.","The book provided very little information regarding winning techniques; but basically information that anyone could acquire at a casino but pushing the HELP button on the video machine; such as payouts, etc. I was hoping for some tried and true methods of improving my odds and did not find any."
3,okay,information did not apply to machines in the casino I played at. the book did familiarize me with the game
3,Air Combat Snippets from World War II!,"Though the cover claims that BATTLE FOR THE SKIES features ""World War II aces tell(ing) their story,"" that's an exaggeration. Basically this book is a collection of aerial snippets from various Allied and Axis aces and other aircrew that served in World War II.Those reminscences are loosely grouped under chapters entitled 'Man and Machine,' 'Battle of Britain,' 'Bomber Offensive,' 'The Wider Conflict' and 'The Pacific War.' Some entries are only one or two sentences long; others run to a page. The overall effect is of a scattershot patchwork of memories with little or no unifying thread.So the book can be entertaining enough but it certainly can't be counted as serious history.An optional purchase."
2,should have been so much better,"Incredibly poorly put together. It's Klobuchar's newspaper writing style mixed with linebacker Jeff Siemon's journal of the 1976 season. I never really got a feel for any of the athletes at all and Klobuchar's analysis of why the Vikes can't win the big one was just plain juvenile. Basically, how does this guy have a job at a newspaper as he does not write compelling text at all?"
1,Not as advertised,DryGuy ShoeDry Boot. Instructions state this unit not intended for heavy boots. Unit is much too light for anything but light shoes or gloves.
4,Optical Cable Worth the Money,Extremely good deal! The cable is high quality with a reasonable price compared to most we looked at.
2,"Optical connection works, mechanical - not so much.","Well, it does pass the signal, which, given the length and supposedly inferior quality of the fiber (melted down plastic bottles, judging by the price?), is an accomplishment. That's the good news. The bad news is that it just does not snap securely into the socket like it is supposed to do and like any other optical cable I used before did. As the result, the cable keeps falling out, which fact is especially annoying when used with the downward-facing sockets in tight places (like the ones found on the back of flat screen TVs.) Be sure, it happens with the connectors on both ends of the cable, and it is definitely not a socket issue as other cables I used with the same sockets work just fine. In theory, I would have returned it with a zeal; in practice though don't think it is worth the hassle - all thanks to a strip of duct tape that keeps this marvel of craftsmanship reasonably secured."
1,Not worth the money. Seek Monoprice cables at 1/10 the cost.,"This was a piece of crap from the day I received it. I went through several mini plug adapters before realizing it was the cable all along that cut in and out, not the adapters. Spent $30 (that I intend to recoup from StarTech) on a worthless piece of rubber. Don't waste your money. You can pick one up likely more reliable at 1/10 the price of this turd."
3,Not real exciting,"Recorded in car looking straight ahead most of the time. For a ""Casual"" and ""scenic"" ride, you don't see much. They'll keep you occupied while riding your stationary bike, but you won't go ""WOW"" to the scenery. Could be better."
3,Exercising Inside,I looked forward to using this DVD and have looked for this type for years. It works for me somewhat but I would have liked it to show more scenery instead of highway.
5,A classic,"A must read for all students of the occult. I will find myself in the open under a full moon,soon,Iam positive."
3,Enjoyable,This is a very fast paced book with lots of action. At under 200 pages it is a very fast read. I do think that the breivity of the book does sacrifice character development. The only character we get to know is Jolie and we only get a small glimpse into her past. I was never sure what made her tick and the character (not unlike real women) seemed inconsistent. I would have liked to have a more indepth look into the characters and into how society had transformed from present day into the bleak future Buckner paints. This is a good sign though. My idea of a good book is one that leaves you wanting more and yet there is no sequel to ruin the mystique.
5,A great read!,"Earth in 2125 has changed, but human needs and emotions stay the same. Jolie Blanche Sauvage makes a living taking wealthy Com managers on trips to the earth's unhealthy surface. But little does she know what she's in for when she meets Jin, perhaps the most spoiled member of the ruling Com class. Jin craves knowledge, and because she has introduced him to the scientist who alters his brain and puts his life at risk, Jolie is compelled to take the most dangerous trip of her life.The characters are great, and the action is tense. I loved this book, and so did my husband. It's a fast thrilling read, and I highly recommend it."
3,OK but there is better,This was a surprisingly disappointing CD from a songwriter who has delivered some classics (eg On A Bus To St Cloud; Secret Of Life). Pass on this and buy her best of CD released in 2009 - it's a much stronger set of songs.
3,A decent Debut for this Prog band,"This is Kamelot's debut cd. It is fair, but it is still good enough for me at least. With Progressive Metal, one needs to listen to each CD a few times before taking a stance for or against it. Kamelot does get better with each of there future releases so do not let Eternity as a focal point of this band's use of talent because they do have it."
4,"Great book, makes you think long after reading it","Not as engrossing as the first two books of the tetrology, The Temple of Dawn meanders through Honda's life in his 50's, as he falls in love with the Princess of Thailand who, he suspects, is the reincarnation of Isao and Iunima, the protagonists of ""Spring Snow"" and ""Runaway Horses"".The book provides for deep reading, and with Mishima's wonderful descriptions and exploration of the mind, it is a book not to be missed.The story deals with the multilayered emotions of Rie (Honda's wife), Keiko (his neighbor), Makiko (Iunuma's romantic interest in Runaway Horses) and other characters.With Honda as the main character, the development of his thoughts on life and death are dealt with in detail, which may provide some moments of ""skipping"", if you're not into that kind of stuff."
2,easy dog training & care,a step by step video guide. dog experts agree that careful obedience training can give your dog a happier and healthier life. with the help of this interactive cd.rom it's easy to get any dog to behave and respond to your commands. whether your dog is big or small young or old you'll find lots of tips and suggestions. packed with video and lavishly illustrated with color photos this cd is a must have for every dog owner. there's no easier way to make your dog more friendly. it did not work well.
2,Pretentious literary NY fiction.,"If you like literary stories about jewish women in NY City going through crises of middle-age this book is for you. The tabloid stuff and cryptozoology stuff (Prose incorrectly uses the term cryptobiology) are poorly researched and mere window dressing. The meat of the book, if you want to call it that, consists of blow-by-blow metaphors describing the ""heroine's"" state of mind as she struggles to relate with her teen daughter, reconcile with her loser ex-husband, and quit smoking. The epiphany is baffling and more than a little unsatisfactory."
1,Ad Hominem from the Girls' School,"This sort of book is acceptable, I suppose, because of the lowly status of the accuser (f$u). Our society accepts that the little guy can rant and rave about hate as long as it's from the bottom up (and we really can't get much closer to the bottom than f$u as far as class, taste and intelligence, can we?). Most f$u fans define themselves by how much they HATE others (UF especially), rather than by any particular pride they may have in their own institiution. That's pathetic. Keep hating, Noles. We'll keep laughing at you. Go Gators."
1,"Uhhh, who are the Knights? UCF?","Yeah, ""University"" of Central Florida is for those who couldn't get accepted to the University of Florida, or any of the other state schools.There are two types of fans in Florida--Gator fans and those who wish they were.Good night, Knights!Go Gators!"
2,"It's not glass or crystal, it's plastic!","Received the item today. Opened the box and was very very surprised. I thought that the candlesticks were going to be made of glass or some cheap type of crystal. They were made out of plastic. I am very upset because they would have been exactly what I wanted if they were glass. So, that's it."
4,This is the Real Deal!!!,"This dvd series is off the chain! I ordered it expecting to see some hot women but got so much more. The women on this series are incredible, I mean asses like butter and pretty faces, its like watching a music video and seeing those fine ass girls in real life. I really enjoyed this because not only do you get to see these beautiful women but you also get to find out about the cities and the nightlife. I'm definitely booking a trip down to Brazil. After seeing this, I may not want to come back!!!"
5,Great,This book was very informative and I recommended it to a friend and she loved it. There were bible references to back up the teaching. I would recommend this to young adult couple.
3,StartechUSB External TV Tuner,"I have XP Home Edition. When I first tried installing this, I kept getting a ""initial h/w fail"" message. After reading the reviews (instead of reading before I bought) I didn't like what I read. After some experimentation, I used the Win98 driver instead of the XP driver. Got it to work just fine. Quality not as good as my desktop card, but it suits my purpose."
1,doesn't work on Dell Inspiron 7500 with Windows 98SE,"The product I received was called a ""Cute TV USB"" so at first I thought I received the wrong item, then I saw the Startech decal on the device (other resellers do use the Cute TV name). The manual was in broken English, and a little hard to understand. The instructions weren't correct and I had problems with files it couldn't find. I got past that, got it installed, and got an error when I tried to use the app ""Init H/W failed"". Support is non-existent at either Startech, other resellers, or the Taiwan firm that actually makes the product, so I returned it."
2,"OK for what I needed, but could disappoint some","I bought this unit because I like to have financial news stations running in the corner of one of my screens. I do run more than one screen, so I do not know if that has a negative effect on operation. Installation took a few times, picture is fair to poor at best. The program is slow and unstable. The program runs ok on my desktop running XP professional, but won't run at all on my laptop running XP home. Its fine for what I'm using it for, but if I really wanted it to watch tv as a goal, I would have ended up returning this item. The USB feature is just too convenient."
1,Laptop owners don't buy this product,This thing crashed my laptop until I finally uninstalledthe drivers and shipped it back. Laptop owners beware!
1,Unable to get support and the right connector for this antenna,"Based on earlier reviews I purchased this antenna. I noted the comment from one reviewer who said he was with Hawking that the connector style had been changed so that users would not have to go through the nuisance of plugging in a key while rebooting the AirPort Extreme, then unplugging it and replugging the antenna cable. Unfortunately, the product still shipping from Amazon includes the older-style connector. E-mails and telephone calls to both Hawking's technical support and customer service contact points went unanswered. I have reluctantly returned this antenna without having the opportunity to see if it would in fact boost my AirPort signal. I think this would be my first Amazon return, ever, in nine years ... and Amazon deserves kudos for a quick and clean return process. But Hawking earns my disappointment for failing to take the most simple of steps to keep its product sold."
1,Save your money...,"I purchased one of these for my airport extreme, and carefully measured signal strength at various points in my house before attaching the antenna. I then measured signal strength again after attaching the antennna, and could not detect any improvement in signal strength at all. I'd give it 0 stars but the form won't let me...."
1,does not fit most handlebars,"The description is misleading.It says ""Fits most handle bars except racing style"".I have tried it on 4 different bikes (2 mountain bike, a street bike and a road bike), none racing style, and the basket fits none.The hooks are either too small for the handlebars, even using pliers to bend the wires, or the basket does not fit under the handlebar stem.BE CAREFUL BUYING THIS ITEM that it will fits your bike. It probably will not work with handlebar stems and does not work with thicker handlebars."
2,didn't fit my handle bars...,This basket would have been great if it had fit my handle bars. I have a trek beach cruiser and the hooks on the basket were too small to fit the bars securely.
2,Rubs off paint,The part that hangs off the handlebars and rests on the front of the bike wears off the paint on your bicycle.
4,Great value,My new basket was so incredibly easy to install... and it's pretty darn easy to take off. It fits my purse and lunch for work... love it. Just don't fill it with heavy stuff... it will make maneuvering harder.
4,Not meant for all bikes,"When i bought the product i may not have read everything as well as i thought but i didn't see anything saying it wouldnt fit on racing / mountain bikes but when i opened it to put it on the directions said it wouldnt but i tried it anyways and while it doesnt really fit like it probably should, it is good enough. the part that should fit fully over the handle bars to hold it in place does not go on all the way so it kind of just sits on top but when i ride it doesnt fall off. it gives me apprehensions about using it as often as i like but it works.. i rode my bike to walmart and it stayed on without me holding it though when i go over bumps i get a little nervous when there is grocerys in it so i do hold the part that should but doesnt fit all the way down.. i have a Mountain bike but it is considered a racing bike because it has the handle bars that extend up from the handles.. like armstrong holds on his bike.."
5,Great bike basket,I bought this basket for my beach cruiser bike! It is basic and holds up nicely. I plan to add a personalized liner to it soon. I have no complaints at all! I highly recommend it.
2,Problem with the bull frog!,"I really would have loved this recording of night sounds in the Smoky Mountains, except for the mike being placed much too close to the bull frog. If the volume is adjusted high enough to appreciate the general ambiance of night noises, the croaking of the bull frog is jarring. Too bad. I listen to recordings of natural sounds to unwind when I'm trying to fall asleep. The bull frog in this one ruins the whole effect."
3,An Adventure in Celtic Scholarship,"The Rev. Joyce offers us a well-reasearched, and scholarly analysis of the elements and factors which define Celtic Christianity. The thorough history of Christian worship as it developed primarily in Ireland allows the reader to virtually travel through time to gain a full understanding of the psyche of the Irish people, and how this has influenced (and has been influenced by) the parallel rise of European Christianity.The author's writing style makes the work a bit more difficult than it might otherwise need to be, however. Much of the factual work is related to the reader in a somewhat cold style, thus requiring the reader to persevere. The basic thesis of the work could be stated more clearly in the introductory chapter, rather than summarized in the end.Overall, a sound, non-judgemental treatment of a subject which each Christian should understand in order to fully appreciate the rich history and diversity of the Church."
4,Very helpful!,This book has a lot of useful and helpful information about hair pulling. I would recommend it to anyone who's needing advice or looking for self help solutions to trichotillomania.
5,eTrex carry case,I like it! So far it has done a fine job of protecting my new Garmin eTrex from wear and tear.
5,"Regardless of other reviews, this is a winner","I received the case yesterday and took it on a hike in pretty heavy woods today. I got fine reception. And you can manipulate the controls OK. Screen covered by plastic to protect but that was not a problem.FYI- I ordered from Amazon and used their free shipping option. They bluffed and said 7 to 9 days. I said OK. I actually recieved the order by UPS in 23, yes 23 hours, after placing order!"
3,Garmin Carry Case for eTrex Series,"Protects the eTrex series gps adequately, but the clear vinyl window has a lot of glare, making the display difficult to view."
3,Carry case blocks sensor?,The case clips on to a belt nicely and fits the unit well. The sensor for reading signals is buried beneath the upper part of the front case where the Garmin emblem is! Why they put the cutout sections in the shape they did is beyond me. Should have left a hole over the part where the sensor is located.
5,A MUST have for your caching,The case is a perfect fit and a nice addition for those treks in the wooods and weeds to find you next geocache. Protects your GPS unit nicely.
5,northern tier play toy,i bought this play toy to begin geocashing and to track route on scouting northern tier trip. did a trial run on charter fishing trip setting it to take reading every 1/4 mile. it did well. also programed in route to beach house and it did well. even did my first geocashe site. have gotten better as i learn features.
3,OK but not useful for me,"This case is ok, nothing wrong with it. It's a lot easier to use the GPS out of the case so I keep it out most of the time. The standard strap is more useful for me. Should have gotten a simple carrying case instead."
5,Great Product,"I bought this case for my Garmin eTrex and am glad I did. The case fits perfectly, allows full use of the buttons, and looks good too. Another feature I like is the sturdy clip that secures my eTrex to my belt when hunting."
3,Carry Case,Easy on & off. However it does interfer with some of the buttons on the GPS. Keeps the screen from getting scratched while in bag or not in use. Also needs to be removed to connect to computer to download.Godiva2
1,No fit on Garmin E-trex 20,This case does not fit on Garmin E-Trex 20. I returned with no problem. Excellent and fast money back.Thanks
3,It works but it is a bit loose,"It does the job for the most part. However, I use this for running in lieu of not having a GPS watch. I hook the belt clip into an armband I have from a similar case I use for my iPod. The excess material around the belt clip lets the case bounce around too much. The bouncing makes it difficult for the GPS to keep a strong signal I have noticed. For the price it is good enough and I can bear the bouncing. I also know how much of my run it may have missed because I can check the trip time on the GPS against my watch."
3,Garmin GPS case clip too weak,"I found the case well made, but having several shortcomings. First and foremost the belt clip does not have an aggressive enough action and comes of belts and pack straps way too easy and would be very easy to lose while hiking. Secondly, My Garmin eTrex 20 fits too snugly and is difficult to put in and pull out with one hand. Next,the toggle button is partially covered by the cover and becomes impossible to do with one hand and lastly, as other reviewers have mentioned, the vinyl window reflects sunlight with lots of glare and covers a portion of the top two data screens."
2,Not for the etrex venture,Would not fit my model of gps. It would go on but I could not get ar my scroll button easily.
2,Bad design,"If this item is supposed to protect a Venture eTrex, it's weak. The upper side of the gps is NOT covered in the sides, just only a narrow area in the center.It's very easy to find sand or similar dirt between the gps screen and the case, that could be worse than having no protection at all. What about a more tighten design/material ?Even worse, the shape of this case seems to be for a different gps model, as it gets in the way of the ENTER/ROCKER key, that is for sure the most used buttom of all the device. This obstruction makes me remove de case almost every time I want to touch the enter/rocker key. A real disadvantage.The clip and the strap are good, but this case shoul be re-designed."
1,Waste of Money,I felt this item was a waste of money and I sent it back. My GPS buttons were hard to use in this device and the velcro looks like it will wear out fast. I took some advice from other reviews and just put a smart phone skin protector on my GPS (cost $4). Now my screen is protected and not bulky like it was in this case. Save your money.
4,eTrex Carrying Case,"Overall, I like this case. It does what I want it to do and that is protect my eTrex from getting dinged up while I'm out geocaching. It does make the unit seem bulky though so I find myself taking it off when I'm not using my eTrex in a manner that would damage it. Seems to be well made."
2,Makes the GPS hard to read,"The case has a plastic window over the GPS display. Unfortunately, it makes the GPS harder to read, especially if the light is not ideal. Also, the window is a little too small, and tends to cover the top of the screen. Since two of the main menus are at the top of the screen, this is a problem. Although I would like the protection provided by the case, I find I can't use it."
4,"good covergae, screen cover has too much glare","this is a perfectly designed case for the etrex legend. Joystick is easily accessible, it fits snug, and the belt clip is nice and secure. My only complaint is the plastic window to protect the LCD. It's pretty thick and seems like it scratches pretty easily and makes the LCD more difficult to read with the heavy glare. Otherwise, it's a good thing to have to protect your GPS from invetible drops and abrasion."
4,Does the job,"This little case cover does the job. The best feature is the clear plastic front that protects the LCD screen. The belt clip on the back is somewhat useful, but I've found that it clips better to a shoulder strap on a backpack better than on a belt loop."
4,Very handy!,"Besides being useful for protection, I found another use for the velcro on the case. I stuck a piece of velcro to my car's dashboard and opened up the flap on the case and stuck it there. Voila! My Garmin now stays put while driving.My only complaint is that sometimes it's difficult to read the screen through the plastic, but I guess that's the price you must pay for having something covering the screen."
3,"Good, But....","Due to the small size of the screen on the GPS, the clear plastic on the case seems to give a LOT of glare making the screen hard to see. Also, due to the design, if the case shifts on the unit at all, it interferes with the joystick."
4,Neat and effective,The carry case is neat and effective way to use a GPS - better than the belt clip. Also protects the GPS which is useful as in mountain use my previous GPS had got quite badly scratched while rock scrambling and climbing.
5,"A nice, helpful accessory for etrex","The Garmin Carry Case for the eTrex and Summit handheld GPS units is a convenient accessory for securely attaching the unit to a belt, backpack loop, or jacket pocket. The case has a clear plastic cover over the GPS screen, a belt clip (stiff spring steel) on the back, and leaves good access to the control buttons. The GPS slides into the case and a Velcro strap secures the case onto the GPS. A small opening at the bottom of the carry case allows the lanyard to be attached. The case is NOT a sealed covering: it just provides some scratch protection and the belt clip.I have used the carry case to attach my GPS to a loop at the top of my small hydration pack when I am out on training runs. The high position gives excellent satellite exposure, and the carry case clip makes a very secure attachment even when bouncing around while running on uneven trails. I also put the lanyard through a clip as a backup, but I haven't had any issues.A recommended, helpful accessory."
1,Disapointing Case,"I used this case for 4 months. It has some good qualities--provides protection for my Etrex 30, easy access to buttons and acceptable window to the Etrex screen. I hang the GPS on my pack using a carabiner connected to the metal loop on the case. Yesterday, while I was hiking, the strap holding the metal loop broke and, unbeknownst to me, my GPS fell off my pack. Fortunately my friend was walking behind me and spotted my GPS on the ground and returned it to me. Otherwise my $400 GPS would have been lost forever. Do not trust the metal loop on the case. Failure after only 4 months suggests that this case is not well made."
2,Scratches easily,I am sure it protects my eTrex Legend well but the display foil scratches so easily that I have to pull the GPS unit out of the case every time I want to check it. A sock would do the same job.
2,could be better,"I bought this so i could clip my gps onto my backpack and lifejacket, worked great for a while but the small ring tore off after 5-10 uses. Not great for serious outdoor use. Hope i can find a heavier duty carrier."
4,Does the job - well.,"The case has much more padding that I expected which is a pleasant surprise. It's made of neoprene with some vynal coverings and has a handy belt clip sewn into the back. The extra padding makes that unit a bit bigger than I would like, but that is a small price to pay for the protection that it offers. The plastic cover over the screen tends to exhibit a lot of glare, but this can be overcome by angling it the right while outdoors. There is a small hole at the bottom to allow the use of the lanyard, but I am less inclined to use it with the case since I will likely clip it to my backpack while in use. Overall, it appears to be a well constructed item and I feel much more comfortable about dropping my vista on occasion (which is almost a garantee) while it's wearing it's new coat."
4,Nice...,"Well, i belive this is a well made product, and will probably out last my GPS unit. It adds very little weight to the unit (about 1 ounce) and has a great belt attachment for easy movement (great for hikes). What I dont understand is the material. When wet it gains weight from the fabric soaqking it up from it getting caught inside the case. Reagardless, a nice product. Also check out Garmin.com."
2,Adaquate,"But the whole design of the top leaves much to be desired. You can get to the four way hat switch, but I'd have rather just had a hole in it instead of this sleeveless approach that leaves a lot of it exposed without adding more functionality. The top still gets in the way of the hat switch, which is the whole reason to have a hole there in the first place. Other than that the item quality is good and it's holding up. People that design this stuff should have to use it or use a prototype, this should have been caught at the design stage."
1,Didn't fit the eTrex 20,It said it would fit the eTrex 20 but it didn't. Was not impressed at all. Really they should make sure that the description tells what models it fits.
5,awesome,i use this on my boat it is a good quality product and works great for finding great fishing areas.
3,It's Just OK,"While the carrying case does fit the eTrex Vista HCx, I find it hard to operate the joystick. Also, when clipped to my belt, the thickness of the velcro closure is irritating. It would have been better if the closure were at the front of the unit instead of at the back."
3,Very Functional,"It works & fufills it's purpose. I don't know what more a person can say about a combination of clear plastic, neoprene & velcro."
4,Excellent Case,"I recently ordered this along with my newGarmin eTrex Venture CX. It was an excellent purchase. It clips nicely on my pockets, backpack, and it fits nicely on ""curtains"" of commercial airliners (most airlines allow you to use GPS receivers once you reach cruising altitude). I can't imagine using my GPS without this case.My only complaint is that it's hard to see the screen without the back light on in some glare situations."
5,Little Gorilla,"This case is built like a little gorillaand cannot be beat for the Amazon priceof about $10. It would be even better ifthere was some way to make a ""no glare""clear plastic cover over the screen butHey, for ten bucks you can't beat thisbaby."
3,Quality Case But Difficult to See-Through,"Very good quality case that is well-worth the price. One minor problem with it is that the clear plastic window that one is supposed to view the GPS screen through produces a lot of glare and scratches easily, making it hard to see through."
3,eTrex Case,"I purchased the carrying case which, unfortunately, slightly obscures the outer edges of the screen and generally makes the screen more difficult to read. Other than that, it get the job done, keeping all the buttons easily accessible."
3,"Useful for protecting your GPS, but not that great","This carrying case is great for protecting your GPS receiver (a Vista HCx in my case) from scratches, especially on the screen, but it does have a problem that the plastic covering the screen is very reflective, so I usually end up removing the carrying case under bright sunlight to be able to read the screen. I think this is a good product, but having the need to remove it sometimes defeats its purpose. Better go to a store and see it for yourself to see if its going to be a problem for you."
2,Not too useful as it comes,"This case isn't too useful as it comes out of the box because the little plastic window is made of ultra-soft plastic that will scratch immediately through normal use, and then you'll need to remove the GPS from the case to actually read its screen, defeating much of the purpose. The Garmin screen itself is made of soft plastic that scratches immediately, and you must protect it with a self-adhesive screen protector. You must do the same to this carrying case. That said, the case fits the GPS snugly and the clip stays on a belt or pack, so other than the soft screen it works as advertised. But why do manufacturers build and sell products with built-in self-destruct features?"
2,Screen glare is a big negative!,"Nice case that fits well and allows you to freely use the controls, but the glare is so bad I couldn't use it and I am following the advice of another reviewer who suggested cutting out the plastic and using a screen protector."
4,Simple,"Just an everyday case, nothing to fancy, but it does fit well. Exactly as described. Great fast shipping. There are however better ways than this to carry your handheld."
2,Somewhat outdated and too broad in scope.,"Any guide which tries to everextent itself by covering a too big an area will shortchange the reader, inspite of the best intensions. This is the case with this nitty-gritty Lonley Planet guide to Russia, Ukraine and Belarus. I've found the information for Ukraine far less useful than in Linda Hodges' guide to Ukraine. Lonley Planet treats Russia, Ukraine and Belarus as if it still were part of the same country it was 11 years ago. All three countries have their unique pluses and minuses, and, lets face it, deserve their own individual guides. The reader is not being made aware enough and therefore does not really appreciate the fact that, for example, Russia and Ukraine are very different from one another, and any similarities are far less common than once assumed.What I liked best about the Lonley Planet guide,and the same is true for their other guides, are the details about the obscure and less-known hotels and restaurants."
3,Big Russia,"The only problem with this book is that if you're planning to travel just to an area of Russia, you won't need as much information of others. Russia is huge so the place you're travelling to, probably just will have a couple of paragraphs...."
2,"Belarus, huh?","What to say about Belarus? Well, we spent the day the White Russkis commemmorate the end of WWII there, so I've seen it in all of its ""grandeur"". Not much to recommend it, go and see Belarus if you missed out on the post WWII East European dictatorships, because Belarus is the last of its kind. A genuine personality cult around the president runs politics, and you can get a feel for what it was like in 1970's E. Europe. Guess what- you will not like it. Take some pics of Minsk & move on to Moscow. And if you can find a decent hotel in Minsk, you've done better than my wife and I did."
5,Solar Landscape Lights,The Westinghouse Fleetwood Solar Landscape Lig ht Set is an outstanding product and met all our expectations for this type of a product.
1,Do not buy...,"I am very disappointed in my purchase of these lights. They do not work at all. Half of them don't even light up at night (even after staying out in direct sunlight all day). Also, the tops tend to pop off sometimes. The light that does come on sometimes is an orange color and hardly lights up the border of my patio. I do NOT recommend this product."
3,cheap but works,"When assembling, pcs can't connect tight enough, even with full charge during the day, the light is very dim. Good for decoration but not for lighting."
3,subtle not bright,"These solar lights are for ""low"" lighting to accent your yard, definitely not to light your way in the dark. But they look nice around my gardens as an accent decor. They hold together pretty well for plastic, but sometimes the plastic tops pop off a few times to make assembling them a test of patience. After a couple of weeks now, I'm beginning to notice that one of them is beginning to dim significantly. I'll try to resolve. The sale price of $29.99 is a little high for the quality, should be around $25, as long as shipping is free."
2,Battery life does not last,"They look nice and are easy to assemble ..the lights worked well for about a month, then half of them stopped working."
1,Not happy at all.,"Thought that they will light during night. Now I decided not to ship back them, as I have to pay the return shipping charges."
1,worthless,I had basically the same ones I bought sometime ago. The new ones I bought off Amazon have never worked properly.Waste of money. Sorry but I am honest and they are basically worthless. I live in Florida with lots of sun and the old ones still come on.The new ones do not.I am sorry I purchased them.
1,Paul Mc,"yep ... junk! Some don't work at all, most don't last long. Other brands really outshine this product."
1,JUNK!,This lights just do not work. I did not want to go through the trouble of returning them so they just went to the trash.
3,Adequate product but not exciting.,Unfortunately the US Postal Dept. did not forward this to my daughter's address. I was in South Korea at the time this item was delivered and so it was returned to Amazon and the order was cancelled. Since then I have seen the same item at a relative's home and I will probably choose to order a similar item from a different manufacturer.I'll watch for similar items in the future.
1,Complete waste of money :-(,"I read the reviews before making this purchase, but there were not as many negative reviews... These lights are extremely wimpy. I have been using solar lights for years and these are seriously sub-par. I had to remove them and replace with another set. Returning them would not be cost-effective, either.In short, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!You would THINK with a brand like Westinghouse, you could trust them to be as advertised. - HA!"
2,OK Lights,"I bought these lights to outline the sidewalk by the front door of my elderly mother's home so that when she came in at night it would be easier for her to see. These lights are not bright enough to illuminate the sidewalk. They just outline the edge of the sidewalk which I suppose is a good thing, but I was hoping for more. If you are looking something to light up the sidewalk, these are not the ones to buy."
1,Please don't buy these lights,I have these lights for a week now. The battery goes down in couple of hours plus the intensity of the light is not that bright also.I'm trying to return them.
2,Cheaper is not better,"I placed these strategically in my front yard which recieves at least 6 hours of full sun a day and only one of the lights comes on, and it only runs for an hour. You get what you pay for!"
4,"Fleetwood Solar Light set, 8 piece","This item is exactly what I was looking for. It takes good light to fully charge these units. Putting them in shade does not work. I was looking for an easy solution to lighting the walks and this does the trick. If you are looking for year-around lighting, it would be best to wire in a set. Item works exactly as advertised."
1,Book is an opportunistic con,"In my opinion, I believe the author has taken another weak stab at weaseling some more dollars out of a periphial relationship with Sid.(maybe once he stood in line behind Sid when getting his morning Bialy?)Since I am reviewing this, I also belive it should clearly be labeled as a work of fiction, as it is obvious to me the author continues to be a schnorrer of others fame for his own meager financial gain in my humble opinion.Unless you know the author, (like the past reviewers, posting ""canned"" reviews) I believe you should consider your purchase of this so called ""book"" just a contribution to his retirement plan.As I said before in my title, I believe this poor excuse for a self published ""book"" is an opportunistic con, similar to a dimestore comic book."
5,Excellent!,"This reed works fantastically! I must say that i am extremely impressed with its superior craftsmanship. It has proper pitch, size and thickness. It is exactly the kind of reed that I was looking for."
1,Dont Waste Your Time,This reed is a complete and utter piece of living crap. Thats about all I can say for it. The reed has a very poor sound quality and I don't reccomend it at all.
4,A Great Addition,Junko has done it again! This is a very dark story and one should note that it's completely intended for mature readers. The art and story is wonderful but the publishing quality of the inside pages is rather low and does not do the art justice.
5,Excellent Critical Essays on Violent Hegemonies,"I have only read a few of the essays in this collection so far, and they are excellent. I especially recommend Catherine Raissiguier's piece on race and domestic partnership in France, Leila Neti's work on the women's dirty protests in Northern Ireland, and the Elizabeth Grosz essay on deconstruction and value. All three are very carefully researched (substantial field analysis), and articulate in driving home their variously made points on the hegemonic power of violence wielded by opressive State mechanisms. I highly recommend this for humanities/social science students, and other readers who are interested in the nexus of minority rights, state violence, and individual civil liberties."
2,Susprise in order,"We found the product on Amazon at a good price with a reasonable delivery time. Ordered 52 of them and they arrived today. Great shipping speed. One problem. They are not what we thought we ordered.We liked the color of the product on the web page and had no suspicion that we would be getting mixed colors instead of a single color as displayed. This sure screws up our ideas about using color of the folders to help delineate years. I sure wish that they had said something, might have used a different brand."
4,rectangle of sins,"rectangle of sins was not as good as the first, in this sequel I was blown away on certain situations this book ended with too many unresolve issue's and I think Nurit should do a third part even though there's not doubt about the unconditional love that Shawn & Natalia have for one another. the question is,is the baby really shawn's even though he said that the baby looks like him on his baby picture's? It ended almost like the first one."
5,Saxxy Love Songs,"This is one of the best saxaphone records I have ever heard. It is exacting, smooth, rich and full. It makes you want to listen all night."
3,MORE A WAVE THAN A SALUTE,"This is a somewhat careless compilation, which runs to just 18 tracks, listed with a minimum of information, and the skimpiest of liner notes. The first half-a-dozen tracks come from the thirties, most of the rest from the fifties onwards. It's cheap enough, and if you want enough of the tracks it's worth a punt, but there are better Porter compilations available."
1,Failed attempt,"Ward attempted to reconcile materialism and Christianity--and fails. There are much better books on both sides. for the materialist side I would rather recommend Dawkins' The Blind Watchmaker or The selfish gene; Rushton's Race, Evolution and Behavior; Jared's The Real American Dilemma; Hawking's A Brief History of Time. This are all beter books from the materialist side. And for a book soundly reconciling Christianity with materialism, I like beter Duke's My Awakening."
4,Les Brown - Anything Goes Review,"Very good big band music. Although the CD does not have a great many cuts, the cuts it does have are very good ones. All the tunes are well known standard tunes. This is important to me since I am the co-host for a weekly big band radio show on a public service station. Les Brown is quite popular with our listening audience. I especially like the sound of the Les Brown Orchestra and the way he uses all of the instrument sections."
1,THIS PRODUCTION NEEDS A LOT OF PRAYERS,"Take it from someone whose been going to operas for 56 years - save your money on this DVD. FORZA was the first opera I was in at the old Metropolitan Opera House. I was in the first act when Leonora's father accidently gets shot. When he fell to the floor, I was there to prop him up so he could curse his daughter with his dying breath. Since that time I've probably probably seen a dozen performances of this opera and appeared in around forty productions if you count dress rehearsals. I know what FORZA should sound like and this performance dosn't come close. There is absolutely no sense of urgency or danger which inspires great singing. Who are these vocalists in this cast? Are they on their way up or down? Even the orchestra is ""chamber size"" and never gets inspired by Verdi's thrilling music. I actually watched the DVD twice in three days and it simply never worked for me."
3,It's Rita's Stand Up Act all over Again,"I love Rita Rudner's comedy act. I've seen it on Television and I've seen it live. Unfortunately when I read her book, I found myself finishing the lines in my head. She has rehashed too much of her old material here and I was hoping for something more. Not that she is a bad author, but she isn't a great one either. As a writer, she is a ... stand up comic. All in all, it was a quick, fairly enjoyable read but wait for the paperback."
2,A Big Miss,"Given my past and quite favorable reaction to Rita Rudner's humor, I was quite unprepared for this flat, predictable novel. The tale of an aspiring comedian, Molly Solomon, the plot takes turns that are at once unsurprising and familiar. The brief glimpses we have of Molly's act are funny, but seem out of proportion with the fame she eventually achieves. Since Rudner uses the '80s as her setting, she manages only to redo the most obvious material. if you must, get it from the library or *very* cheap."
4,A Star for Verdi,"There are some excellent voices on this recording of Rigoletto. Jan Peerce was one of my favorite singers (and also of Arturo Toscanini) with his clarion voice and dashing stage presentation. Leonard Warren was another artist who could always give pleasure with his mellow baritone. This CD gives an extra bonus in the form of recordings from La Forza del Destino, La Traviata, Simon Boccanegra and Otello. I was not taken so much by Erna Berger. She failed to give the impression of a naive young girl. I see that I have not said a whole lot about this particular recording."
3,a boring series,"While the characters were vastly more entertaining than the ones in the previous book & the writer not quite so long-winded, this book was still rather bland & as boring as the rest of the series.With about 80 novels in the DL series, it's a good thing that not all of them are worth reading a 2nd time(or 1st for that matter)but it still drives me crazy when they so obviously give some of these books a half-hearted attempt."
2,Could be useful as a very basic intro to the subject.,"This two-volume set is a collection of articles originally published in ""Ceramic Industry"". At least 80% of the articles were published in the 1920's and 1930's, and so are quite dated in their approaches and conclusions. However, if an historical reference is useful, or if you are new to the field of raw materials for the glass industry, these articles are still quite useful in spite of their age. Good introduction to minerals mining and their use in the glass industry."
4,cool and catchy,"I bought this CD in Tokyo. A jazz fanatic friend of mine found it too sterile, but I love the cooler-than-cool, laid back precision of the playing. I also happen to be a Lupin III fan -- the ""Zenigata March"" wonderfully captures the menancholic honor of Lupin's ever-faithful foil, and ""Fire Treasure,"" although not the best version I've heard, catches both sides of Lupin's almost quixotic quest after some ultimate treasure."
1,Absolute idiocy,"I've only been in college for a semester and I'm so sick of ultra far-right groups complaining about how ""liberal"" colleges are. Their basic solutions seem to be that we should convert all colleges to christian-based ones.Not once during my time here have I heard on my professors tell students that there is no god, or that Marxist-Socialism is the only way to live. We have intelligent student debates with liberal, conservative and libertarian students, as well as students who aren't even American citizens.No one ""indoctrinates"" anyone in college. You have a mind of your own. Think for yourself."
2,Not what it needs to be,"I've used more than one Haynes book and this one is really no different from the others. Ostensibly for the do-it-yourselfer, too much needed detail is left out. Far more photos are needed, especially to illustrate different models. That might just mean more versions of these books are needed. Just to illustrate what I mean, I recently changed the water pump on my Taurus. Nowhere in the manual does it mention the need to remove idler pulleys, move the alternator, remove the right wheel to access bolts, or the odd fasteners Ford uses. No hints are given for gaining access or for the most efficient procedures to get to the pump. Again and again, terms are used without explanation or illustration. Haynes is probably no worse than other repair manuals, but it's consistently disappointing in being no better."
3,Haynes Taurus Repair Manual,"This manual is typical of most consumer level repair manuals. If you have some experience working on cars and just need some general information about the specific car you are working on, the manual will generally be adequate. For lack of detail an in-experienced mechanic will often find this type manual lacking in sufficient detail. If you want detail, be ready to pay the price and seek out a professional's manual."
5,GREAT!!!,"Great product, and fast shipping. It said it was used but it was still in the packaging! new for the price of used, cant beat that!!"
1,Not what it's cracked up to be.,"The book may be useful for older models, however I would not recommend purchasing this book if you have an 05 with DOHC engine. The book barely covers it and has very few photos of that engine in the car. I purchased this book trying to get a good description of plug replacement in my 05 Sable DOHC. The dealer wants nearly $300 to change the plugs. The intake plenum has to be removed to even get to the back three. This book doesn't even talk about the configuration my engine has with individual coil packs and there are NO photos at all of my engine in that section. This is the 1st automotive book I have bought in many years and if this is indicative of what has become of Hayne's manuals, I won't be purchasing any more."
4,Good Manual for do-it yourselfers,"Our 2nd vehicle is a 1998 Mercury Sable Wagon, with approx 130,000 miles. Lately, a lot of little things have broken, and are nickel and diming us. Bought this manual so we could do more repairs ourselves rather than taking it to our mechanic. Have owned similar manuals for other vehicles that we've owned, and found these manuals to be very helpful"
5,Haynes Repair Manual,I prefer the Haynes repair manual as it gives you more pictures and detailed information than a Chilton repair manual.
4,Good book,I am so glad I bought this book. It actually help me to get a better point of view of my car on how to fix things.
3,review,"a great product for my vehicle, although it was in a bit of a tatty state when it arrived. but, for the price paid it is ok."
2,Pussy Cat Parkour,"Too much talking! Way too much respect for authority garbage. This video is like a cat without claws... or a man without balls. I had to fast forward through most of this one. Unfortunately the director of this dvd thought people would be interested in what these guys have to say. I couldn't care less. I just want to see the movement. Like every cool thing in the world people would rather talk about it than do it. The world needs more Parkour and more videos documenting it. Next time more action less lip service. Too bad cause all the athletes are talented. Hearing them blabber about it only stole from the beauty of their skills. Also, get a few songs. The same damn song plays through the whole movie! Nice try.....to bad tryin' is cryin'. This vid is like a move that could've been epic ,but bails hard in the end."
5,Exactly what I expected,"I have used Avery mailing labels for almost 20 years. I like the fact that they are perforated between each label instead of every 10 as is the case with many store brands. The adhesive is strong and quite durable which allows me to use them for many applications other than addressing envelopes - labeling the breakers in our church ""fuse box"" for one example.Avery products are reliable, and the quality has not changed for many years. I recommend them without reservation."
4,"More About the Nez Perce, Less About the Missionaries Please","Really I would rate this book at 4 stars if Amazon would let us. It is a good book, but, at least for me, it does not quite make it to 5. I felt a little too much time was spent on the history of the missionaries sent to the Nez Perce lands. I do realize though that this was an important event that caused a rift in the tribe, so it needed to be covered. When I was reading the bits about the lives of the missionaries, the book started to bog down. I was more interested in learning about the Nez Perce than the settlers. Other than that, I thought the book was good, and well written. I will definitely be reading more on the Nez Perce in the future!"
2,"studio mix, studio band","When I read the other reviews I figured this had to be a must have cd. The players are good but I hear no dynamics (mp,ff etc.)The rhythm section plays at the same dynamic through out the album. The arrangements are somewhat interesting at times but give me the Basie band with Sammy Nestico charts. I grew up listening to Buddy Rich, Stan Kenton, Herman, Ellington & Basie.When an album is mixed now the two main instruments you hear are bass and drums. What about the 3rd trumpet, the bass bone, the 2nd tenor? Ahhh, lost in the mix...and also lost is the excitement a hot big band can create."
5,Goodwin!,This is a great fun big band album that has facinated jazz fanatics all over the world. From the stop time section soli's in Count Bubba to the Salsa feel of Shake Your Bones this album is a solid testament to big band music. 5 stars!
1,"Did not receive DVD Audio format disc, and condition was not as stated.","The listing clearly stated this was a DVD Audio disc. However, what I received instead was the DVD Video version recorded in Dolby and DTS - not in DVD Audio, which was the whole purpose of the purchase. Also, the stated condition was 'like new' when actual condition was good at best, as the playback surface was covered with small scratches. Otherwise, the album itself, especially the actual DVD Audio version, makes for some excellent high-end stereo and multi-channel audio demos."
5,Jazz Student's Textbook,"If you're a trumpet player looking for some absolutely phenomenal lead playing, look no further. Wayne Bergeron can really knock the walls down. The band is tight, and the mix is powerful. Yes, it's a thrown-together studio band, but it features the highest tier of musicians out there. In one word, this band is SOLID."
5,'Swingin' doesn't begin to describe it...,"If you love jazz, big bands, synchronized brass sections and individual improvisation within the big band sound you'll love this CD. And what a mix of sounds, from Latin to Bach.Some will sneak up on you. The title track, ""Swingin for the Fences"" is actually ""Sweet Georgia Brown"", but if you're listening for anyone to make the statement by playing the straight melody, forget it. Five minutes and eight seconds of orchestrated improvisation around a melody that's only there in your own mind. What a marvelous treatment.Do yourself a favor. Get this CD."
5,Awsome!,I had the privlege to hear and meet Gordon and the band in person when they held their rehersal at out school band room! I heard many of these songs in person and was compelled to buy the audio version. You willnot be disappointed with this buy. Get it!
2,"great music, poor sound quality","I was really disappointed with the quality of the recording. There is a lot of hiss. It sounds like it was taken from a cassette. Couldn't someone remaster it before releasing it for sale? If it were circulating as a bootleg I would grade it a low B. The band is hot, but it is hard to get the full feel because of the dampened sound. The Filmore East concert remains their best live recording IMO."
3,"Great show, lousy audio",Killer show and it's great to hear Duane and Berry live! But the audio sounds very bootlegged like it was recorded on a little pocket cassette recorder although it WAS 1971!
2,Sad Recording of a Great Concert,"I was excited to hear that this album was going to be released. However, after it arrived and I listened to it a few times my excitment dwindled due to the poor sound recording. I find it hard to believe that with all the modern technology they could not have cleaned up this recording. I am sure this was a superb concert, but it got lost in the translation on this CD. Shame on those who produced it and did not take the time to polish it to its full potential."
3,Blue Sky makes it worth having.,"I have to admit that the sound quality is not that great on the first five songs, but when Blue Sky is played, it's on! I love the long jam songs and this one is twelve minutes of bliss. The second cd has another of my favorites-In Memory of Elizabeth Reed and the Allman Brothers deliver a healthy dose of solos."
2,"Sorry, but this sound quality is too abysmal to overlook","Let me say upfront that I love the ABB and Duane in particular, so I was very excited when this arrived in the mail today. A few weeks back I had finally acquired the import/SACD version of Fillmore East and couldn't be happier with it. But for me, the sound is like listening to an AM radio in your car during the 70's, and not a very good radio at that. I hope to revisit it soon and somehow overcome the poor sound, but it's going to be a real challenge."
3,Fillmore hard to match,"A good show though equiptment/recording problems are apparent...not professionally done like Fillmore. Unreasonable to expect the quality of the best live album ever, but the songs have energy-and there are some new ones like BLUE SKY. Early Allman Bros. had a setlist they rarely strayed from, and although they improvised, they stuck to blues scales so the conversation can become repetitive. Good addition for fanatics..though Fillmoe East (original) is preferable, and enough for the casual fan."
2,"Great session, poor quality","Yes, this is a powerful great performance by the band, but unless my CD got some sort of manufacturing problem, the recording is pretty bad, like a bad bootleg. The sound is flat, no brightness and no depth, and the mixing is almost non existing. The playing is superb, but this CD sounds like somebody in the audience recorded it. Only for die hard fans. I am a fan and am having problems getting over the bad sound quality..."
4,give it some time...,"When you start to listen, the first thought is ""how dare they use this for a commeral release?"" - its that bad - Muddy and incredibly hissy. With ""One way out"" the sound becomes significantly cleaner and the fireworks between duane and dickey start to get crazy (This hiss disappears but some static persists in the right channel until the end of the track). The intro chords to the often discussed ""Blue Sky"" are like a refreshing sun shower. By the time you're at ""You don't love me"" you're like Jennifer Jason Leigh in Rush - on your hands and knees combing through the carpet for more."
1,Does not Play...,"S.U.N.Y. at Stonybrook (Live 9/19/71)After over 7-8 years of shopping at Amazon i may be thru , i purchased Allman Bros. Live at S.U.N.Y NY 9/19/71 and it would not play , which seems to be the norm for their music cds over the last couple of years... Will have to find the 2 disc set elsewhere because i have heard it and if you are an Allman Bros fan its a must have."
4,Allman Brothers at Stonybrook,Great show. Slight imperfections on the soundboard tape but exceptable. Always enjoy these early Allman shows. Would highly recommend this show to any Brothers fan.
5,Great,"I have long been an Allman Brother's Band fan and when I first heard Dreams, that is recorded on this album, I was very happy. For any fan who likes the old school Brother's, this album is a must have."
3,"Worth it for the 19 minute version of ""Dreams"".","I pretty much bought this to hear the lengthy version of ""Dreams"", and it's worth it for that. Otherwise, the audio is not that great. So, this is for hardcore fans only."
2,But it had such promise!,"While musically there are some real gems, sonically this set sucks. As other reviewers have noted, the sound quality is bad but gets better. Well yes...it goes from absolutely horrid to well below average at its best. I seem to recall getting higher fidelity from 8-track tapes!"
4,Ferocious Jams,"Yes, the sound is not even close to perfect BUT the band is hot and this is definitely worth hearing."
1,Google this author,"I think anyone considering reading this book should first, Google the author and see if his is the kind of advice you really want to take. Probably not."
5,Good book - good series,"I first downloaded the Grayson Brothers book "" Shades of Honor"", and was fascinated by the story, the characters and the excellent voice of the author. I found her page and downloaded the stories of each of the other brothers. The characters are well-drawn, the plots are realistic, and the author makes us care about what happens."
4,Lips that Ouch Mine,I read all Four of the Grayson Brothers books. And they were all four just asgood as the last one. Keep me wanted to get to the next one. And then I wanted there to be a fifth brother even. You will enjoy this author for sure.
3,Lips That Touch Mine,I enjoyed the series of the Grayson Brothers but was sorry that they used so much swearing and sexual descriptions that were totally un-needed for the story.
5,Very Funny,Very Funny book. Listen to many not so bright people come up with some not so bright things to say.
1,greasy. Prefer the lotion,"I couldn't find the icy hot pm lotion and tried this balm. Absolutely hated it. So much greasier than the lotion, and hard to get out of the container. I ended up taking a paper towel and rubbing it off so I would not ruin my clothes. I'll stick with the lotion and maybe try the gel. I like the smell and it doesn't last that long anyway."
1,BEWARE,"I bought this item and totally wasted my money! It came without a serial number and when I emailed the seller they said that they could not help me and to contact Avery. Avery said that they advise customers not to purchase Avery software from Amazon and that they did not have a serial number. I should try to return the item. Also, I can download design pro for free from their web site. Please don't' buy this!"
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,"You get what you pay for. It's like having a couple of candle lights in your headlights. Worthless! Of course it's made in China, where else."
1,"Simple to Use software, but multiple flaws","I purchased this unit because after looking at the software is seemed relatively easy to use. The first unit arrive broken. The second arrived intact and worked as Dymo intended but not as I wish it would. The problem stems from the fact that the machine acommadates four different tape sizes, but only two cartridge sizes. If you put a larger tape in, for instance one inch, rather than 3/4 inch, you are stuck with the margin limitations of the 3/4 tape and thus smaller fonts. No way to override this is software."
5,A GREAT AND MUCH NEEDED RELATIONSHIP GUIDE FOR SINGLE WOMEN,"I MUST ADMIT I WAS TURNED OFF BY THE TITLE. I ASSUMED THE AUTHOR WAS GOING TO DO LITTLE MORE THAN COMMUNICATE PLACES TO MEET RICH MEN (THE RITZ FOR TEA, GOLF, CONVENTIONS). INSTEAD I WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED; THIS BOOK PROVOKES A REFRESHING LOOK AT OURSELVES, OUR BELIEFS, ATTITUDES, LIKES AND DISLIKES, EXPECTATIONS, INSECURITIES, AND OTHER FACTORS THAT MIGHT HAVE KEPT US FROM BEING IN A WONDERFUL RELATIONSHIP. I USED SOME OF THE EXERCISES FOR A RELATIONSHIP CLASS THAT I CONDUCTED IN THE VIRGIN ISLANDS. IT WAS A SUCCESS. THERE IS A REAL NEED FOR THIS BOOK TO BE BACK IN PRINT AND ON THE MARKET. IF I HAD SOMETHING TO BACK IT UP, I WOULD GUARANTEE EVERY WOMEN THAT SHE WILL LEARN AND GROW AS A RESULT OF READING THIS BOOK AND, MORE IMPORTANTLY, DOING THE EXERCISES AT THE END OF EACH CHAPTER. EVERY SINGLE WOMEN SHOULD READ THIS BOOK."
4,Save on winter apparel--grow hair?!,"Koren, creator of hairy cartoons for the New Yorker and other magazines, has turned his talents to the younger set with a story about one Hairy Harry, who decides he wants to be very, very hairy--hairier than anyone else. Harry notes the advantages of shagginess:*Your dog can look like he's a part of you.*You can hide all your favorite things on your body.*You can forgo winter apparel.Alas, hairiness has one distinct drawback. Will Harry remain very hairy or will he end up in the barber's chair?This is a fun story and book with Koren's unique, quirky illustrations."
4,"Definitely increases range, but location & orientation is critical","This unit will definitely extend your WiFi range, but finding a good location with proper orientation of the unit can be a tedious process. I highly recommend using the FREE WiFi Network Scanner software called ""inSSIDer"" to assist you in positioning the unit. The software is available at: [...]NOTES:The Alfa AWUS036H USB2 WiFi adapter works well with this antenna.For other WiFi adapters having removable antennas, you can further extend your range by using a Booster Amp (such as the Hawking HSB2) between this antenna and your WiFi adapter."
5,Works well,"I use this to get reception on a computer located diagonally opposite from a router of the far side of the house. It can get a signal through a cinder block wall at about 50'. Of course, it has to be aimed precisely at the router to do this, but it works.Of course, you need a network adapter with an SMA connector to use this."
2,Disappointed...no support for airport express,I was very excited to use the device until I discovered there was no way to connect it to an Airport Express.
2,1 star as compared to Hawking dish,"For me the Hawking minidish, the white one, worked way better. So one star based on comparing it to the white dish."
1,sorry - big step back,"Service from Amazon was great,better than expected. This antenna however was useless to me. Standard omni ant gave 1 to 2 bars. My 7 dB Omni ant gave solid 3 bar reading. This one went from 1 bar to complete loss of signal when aimed at source and peaked.. I had hoped being directional would help."
2,Iffy performance,"My WiFi system is operating inside the house. The problem is that the modem is on one side of the 70 foot first floor and my ""want to operate"" is on the other side. The antenna needs to operate through 2-3 concrete walls plus at least one conventional wall because of the house's overall design.I followed the instructions, placing the unit on the wall facing the other space. Before signal levels were extremely poor or non-existant. Now signal level are just ""poor"". I was disappointed with the unit's performance."
2,Don't waste your money,"Don't be fooled into thinking that this antenna is going to help in any situation other than a very large room. I'm not sure how much this antenna would be even over the standard antenna.I set this antenna up with my Hawking router and found it couldn't even pass through a few drywall walls without losing most of the singal. My linksys router did just as well, if not better than this antenna.Also the mount for this antenna is a bracket which you can only mount into a corner, and you have to use double-sided tape to attach the antenna to the bracket."
2,Didn't help at all,"In 90% of the areas I compared signal strength, and actually decreased it in some. In a spot of two I did get a 5%-10% increase in signal strength. I'm sure there's a use for this device somewhere out there, perhaps, as someone else noted, in an auditorium. I can't fathom it being of any use in a home though,"
3,"Works, but not well enough","I tried this antenna on two different routers and found that it did improve signal strength and distance. However, it maxed out at only about a 10% improvement in signal strength. And the Hawking didn't improve the quality of my Skype sessions, which is why I bought the Hawking antenna in the first place. The expense of the antenna for a marginal increase in signal wasn't worth it to me, especially since I got the same quality Skype sessions from the standard antenna."
2,No Improvement,"I did thorough testing before and after installing this antenna. I was replacing a Linksys +7db antenna. Testing revealed no improvement throughout my entire house, and one area (inside directional field of antenna) was actually slightly worse. I went back to the old antenna and am installing this in another access point in my garage."
2,no incremental improvement over standard d-link antenna,looks and sounds like a nice product. I removed the tiny antenna from my d-link 524 router and plugged the hi-gain corner antenna in and pointed it directly at my powerbook in a room I had been getting ok but not great reception. result: no discernable improvement in reception strength or quality of transmission. amazon accepted return but at my shipping expense as item was not defective.
3,Inconclusive,"Not real sure how to rate this. The ordering process was quick and easy, shipment was not a problem. The actual performance of the product was questionable, in that it MAY have worked. The conditions in which the product was expected to perform in may have exceeded the products abilities. My test procedures were inconclusive to be able to give a helpful opinion."
3,minus two stars already,"I haven't gotten it yet. I ordered it on October 9th. I clicked ""ships in 3-5 business days"", the next day I got my e-mail receipt.The scheduled delivery date is October 20th. I realize that I made the purchase late Saturday night, so I figure take away Sunday, that give 3-5 business days for it to get to my house by Friday.Maybe I'm doing my math wrong but I calculate October 20th to be 11 days after the date of order. Maybe I'm doing my math wrong, but 11 days is not the same as 3-5 days.I'm writing this on the third business day, and I enter my tracking number and all I get is ""Carrier notified to pick up package"".Guess what? If you had told me it was going to take that long, I would have bought it from somewhere else."
5,Long Distance Champ even outdoors,"I set up this antenna to connect two buildings together. For a strsight shot with clear line of sight I have max connection, even in weather. Distance 200 yards. In my home I receive and boost the signal with a dlink repeater."
5,From 1 bar to 3 from low to good from 5k to 1 meg WiFi,"This is just the best. Went from 1 bar to 3 from low to good from 5k to 1 meg WiFi. What a product.The only thing that would make this the best product ever would be a window mount!A great price, fast ship from [...] and even free s&h.; Nice!"
1,Minimal improvement,"I compared this unit to a +7db dipole antenna which cost one fourth as much, and the dipole pulled in twice as many access points with a much stronger signal. The Hawking is supposed to be a 15db unit, but it did little better than the +2dB stock antenna on the Alfa network adaptor, even when pointed directly at the access point.I returned this unit."
4,"Works great, but...",...you pretty much have to have it pointed exactly where the source is. So it may need to be mounted at a awkward position. It will pick up from a good 200 feet through several walls.
4,As advertised,i used this antenna in conjunction with a Pepwave surf to bring free wifi into my office from my city's wireless mesh network. I saw a significant signal increase over the standard antenna.The only negative is they should double the cable length
1,"Bland, lifeless reissues.","I think these are taken from the 1960s Columbia LPs, with a little more high end filtered out. Not good listening at all."
3,Sub-title a bit misleading,"While the book contains much detailed information about the history, regulatory environment and composition of the world's index futures, it does not provide much practical information about the ""ins & outs of trading"" these contracts."
1,Not the custom fit pictured,"Although these flap are ""molded"", they don not fit a 2002 Ford tarus as shown in the picture. I was able to find OEM flaps, albeit for more money, but they look like they were made for the car...because they were"
5,"Air Cleaner, hepa inner filter","This product serves as a absolute necessity whensuffering from serious allergies. This producthas literally changed my life indoors! I canbreath clean air again!! Good price great deal.83239 air cleaner Hepa filter.PS use it for a month. Then examine the(outer diameter) to the hepa filter, thattraps particulates(dirty air)then look atthe center (inside diameter)...Pure brightwhite that the area that relieses very,veryclean filtered air into your surroundings.Note: I'm just a happy custumer, not affil-iated with any filter company."
5,An Awesome WakeUp Call,"Southerners don't have to be second class citizens any longer. We can be free. This book tells how. It gives the answers, refutes the critics, and is unashamedly Southern right down to its dangling prepositions. I loved it. Other books tell you the past. This one shows you the future!"
2,Not realistic,"This was just silly. I didn't know when i bought the book that it would be a how-to on seceding from the union. While it's a nice idea and all, the author deftly avoids the stinging southern history of ill-treatment toward blacks. I can't see how you can mount a defense of the south but not even reconcile that ugly bit of history. Unless you serious want to secede from the union, this is a poorly written waste of time."
2,A must read - but not for the usual reason,"This book is important, not so much because it's a good book (it isn't), but it accuratly demonstrates the threat the 'confederate mindset' constitutes to real America. The south has been attempting to destroy America since the days of the revolution. That threat has not ended, indeed it's growing, and is largely ignored by the intelligencia in the rest of America.Read this book, so you can know your enemy."
5,Ghost Boy = Good Book,"This was the first book of Jean Simon's I had ever read, and I have to say that it left a very good impression on me. It's a story about a young girl, Joely, who meets a ghost in the cemetery. Most stories that feature ghosts can get pretty complicated at times - but Simon's tale of murder, mystery, tragedy, and triumph is beautifully woven together. The storytelling was easy to follow - no stupid purple prose from this author. I highly recommend it to anybody who likes to read a good mystery-ghost story."
1,No Fran?,Its simple. How can you have a Best of the Vikings set without any Fran Tarkenton games OR with that monster defense they had in those days? None of these games are the Classic Vikings. Where is Joe Kapp? This isn't worth bothering with.
1,Grossly Misleading Title,"Viking history didn't start in 1988. The Vikings won the NFL championship in 1969 and won 3 NFC championships in the 1970s. The fact that they ultimately lost the Super Bowl doesn't negate those accomplishments, and the key games that led to those championships need to be included in any set that calls itself the Minnesota Vikings Greatest Games. Sorry, this selection just doesn't cut it. Actually, it is inexcusable."
1,Not even close to buying this.,"Where are the legendary games of the 70's Legendary teams? I looked at the listing of games presented here and couldn't stop laughing. No Foreman, Brown, Osbourne, Washington, Gilliam, Tarkenton, Purple People Eaters, Kapp, the list goes on and on. One reason maybe that those games are hard to find, I could see that point since these are older games that I want to see. But if the classic 70's teams are not included in the set then there's no reason to buy it. Sorry."
5,Gotta Love those Vikings,"I've been a Mn Vikings fan since my father had season tickets from the beginning in 1961. Over the years I passed my enthusiasm for the Vikings on to my 25 year old daughter. For her birthday this past August, I got her this set of five DVDs thinking she'd have them to watch during the many VERY COLD LONG WINTER DAYS and NIGHTS we endure in Minnesota. She's already watched them all and has given them back to me to watch. She loved them!!! What a good idea I had, I'm looking forward to watching them myself. The price was right and they arrived much quicker than I expected."
3,I agree partly!,"The games you listed would not be my choices either, save the 49er Game when Anthony Carter shined. I think our Super Bowl runs (unfortunately not wins) deserve to be considered, my favorite game ever was the 1998 Packer game on MNF. We beat the Pack at home, and in the rain and Randy Moss was superb (I still miss him!). I also agree that the Rashad catch game should've been included. The Vikings have always been considered an ""also ran"" NFL team like the Chargers, the old Oilers, and a few others. We are the Rodney Dangerfield of the NFL! We get very little coverage and are ignored by the East & West Coast Media. That being said, if the price is right I'll purchase the DVD as I usually buy anything that involves our Minnesota teams...unless it's negative."
1,the co should not state that this is color when it isn't,"amazon stated that this was a color dvd when there was only 1 color & all the rest was b/w now i have to go thru the trouble of returning it--- this should not happen, state truthfully if it is b/w or color and let the customer decide, amazon should not trick the customer like that"
5,outstanding,"These Avery labels are excellent quality, I've never had a problem with these ripping, yet I can peel them with ease. They fit in the paper trays and they are pulled into printers, line up with the software that i've used, printed, and expelled onto the output tray. I've NEVER had a problem using them. I also use them for things like labeling wires and pipes in my house. I've even used a couple of them as Christmas gift labels after I ran out of regular labels. They are easily stored. Purchased from Amazon, it arrived quickly and in excellent condition. I give everything that I review a grade, and I believe that this merits a solid ""A"". I highly recommend it for anyone who uses labels for mass mailings, printed labels on files, etc."
5,Reliable Labeling,"When you're sending out hundreds of invitations to an important event, the last thing you need is problems with your labels. Inferior labels can you slow you down and give a bad impression to your guests. Last weekend I sent out 200 invitations to an annual affair using these Avery Easy Peel laser labels and I'm pleased to report - that I have nothing to report! They performed flawlessly. By using the appropriate template in Microsoft Word, each label was perfectly positioned on the page. The ""Easy Peel"" design meant I didn't have to struggle to remove individual labels from the printed sheet when placing them on the envelopes. And there was absolutely no smudging as my sweaty little fingers placed each label on its envelope. So with no flaws to report, I have to give this product my highest rating. Use it with confidence."
4,Lots of Labels,"I have two different laser printers, each with a special envelope slot that is meant to feed envelopes so that you can print an address directly on each envelope. There are two problems with both. First, you can feed only one envelope at a time (they won't accomodate a stack of envelopes). Secondly, half of the time the envelope jams and you must pull the printer apart to fix the problem. So, I have given up on running envelopes through my laser printers.The Avery Easy Peal mailing label sheets fit into the standard 8.5"" by 11"" tray and feed flawlessly through the print track. I can print 300 labels in less than a minute and each label peels off the backing easily and can be stuck to an envelope or package quickly.The drawback is, you must run a sheet of 30 labels through the printer even if you need only one label. But if you have a lot of mailing to do, this generous quantity of labels helps get the job done quickly and inexpensively."
2,Avery labels - be careful with this vendor!,"I requested Avery 5160 labels. I got Avery labels, but not the ones I asked for. I received 8460s. They are similar in size, but not exact. I had to move my data over in order to print correctly on the left side, which means that I wasted an entire sheet until I figured out the problem. When you order 5160, you should GET 5160.The package was received quickly.I won't use this vendor again."
5,The Best Labels,"Avery makes a high-quality label - I have never had a problem with these labels holding ink (no smudges) or losing their ""stick."" Also, they never jam in the printer - a huge plus. I use them for everything from large mailing to labeling my kid's school books. Avery's free online templates are really useful too (avery.com)."
4,Nothing special,"These are quality labels and in all my time using them I've never had one jam nor smudge (as advertised). However I never have had a problem with my labels jamming or smudging so I don't necessarily see how these specific labels are superior in any sense from other, possibly even off-brand labels."
5,High Quality Labels,"These labels are very easy to use. The cut lines on the page are very sharp so there are not any tears or snags when peeling a label from the page. We ran multiple pages through a laser printer and through an ink jet with no problems (Using MS Word label template. This is a standard size that was listed in the software). In fact, I put the sheets in upside down in one of the printers and ran them back through the correct way and they still flowed through perfectly. They peel easily off the page so you don't have to worry about creasing them when trying to peel them off. Highly recommended."
4,Not much to say about labels except that these get the job done,"They don't get jammed in the printer, the labels don't peel off unexpectedly, the sheets do not stick together, so that is all that I ask from labels. One thing that you should consider is the price and how many you'll need.The price for the labels is competitive versus others in the market. While 3000 labels may be too much for the individual user, the number might be just right for an office with a lot of mailings. I am somewhere in between and have found these to be perfectly acceptable."
4,And otherwise good work...,"An overall well-written work. However the author's obvious anti-traditionalist bias (his constantly negative comments on the miracles, the mawlid etc.) intermittently distract from the reading."
5,El mejor disco de musica de banda.,"He escuchado el disco de banda cuisillos y lo considero el mejor en su clase, les recomiendo ampliamente que lo compren..."
2,Smaller than expected,"I purchased the pendant to replace one that I lost a few weeks ago, but was very disappointed after receiving it and finding out that it was only about one-half inch in size. The pendant that I sought to replace was at least one inch and fit perfectly on my gold chain. Aside from the size, it is a very nice piece of jewelry."
5,Tremendous value in many ways,"Small. Light. Easy to maintain. Easy to use.I could go on and on. Originally I bought a LIFESAVER 4000 or something. It was bulky. Heavy. Finicky. A lot of ""don't do this"" and ""don't do that"" in the instructions. At the end of the day the lifesaver was not a practical solution for me.I found the answer in this. Great tasting water through this (from a muddy puddle to test it out).I bought a spare filter and a maintenance and spare parts kit. Everything fits in the included bag.Awesome!"
5,Excellent!,"This is what we took on our 24 mile, 3 day hiking trip on the Crow Pass Trail in Alaska this summer. We used it in glacier run off and clear mountain lakes. At one point we did have to completely take it apart and clean it but this was due to the heavy glacier silt in the water we were having to purify. It was easy to clean and put back together. Worked well for three people, I liked that I could hook up my nalgene bottle directly to it.That one belonged to my neighbor but I liked it so much I am buying myself one.Happy trails!"
4,MRS Miniworks water filter,"Although I haven't had the chance to use this product as yet , I have read an awful lot of reviews written by people that have used this filter . After inspecting it pretty thoroughly , I believe I am safe in saying that It has all the makings of a well made water filter. After all, if it is used by our military , it must be one of the best because of the tough tests that they run them through before they are issued . I plan on using mine in emergency situations and camping trips. Only down side that I see in it is , it does not filter out viruses ."
4,great little filter!,Check out my review of this filterThis is my first pump filter & I really do dig it. Light weight & packable.
5,It will save your life,"My first test run was up at South Lake Tahoe, and this kept me going day in and day out. In the back-country it is vital that you keep hydrated, this thing filtered a good 4-5 liters per day. It works and is if very rugged design, I have been using this very filter for many many years. It takes about 3 min to fill your bottle (32oz) if it the ceramic filter is kept clean!!! Great product!!"
4,"Best on the market, still could be better.",Pros: Its relatively cheap.The ceramic filters last forever.Its light.Easy cleaning.solid design.Cons: It clogs easy.It doesnt put out a whole lot of water quickly.Any questions?
4,Microfilter,Did everything that it claimed to.It was used for 6 months in India and Nepal and then around 4 months in west Africa. So it has been used enough to put it to the test.
5,Would'nt buy it from Sportsmans Guide,"MSR makes great products and the miniworks microfilter is no exception. However, I would not recommend buying it or any other product from Sportsmans Guide - their customer service department is completely undependable. Do yourself a favor and find a reputable reseller."
3,It Worked Well At First,"When I bought this it worked well, and it was faster than my friends pumps. I took it apart and cleaned it after every use, and I treated like it was extremely fragile. I just pulled it out after a year of not using it, and the check valve failed on the trail. It pumped a couple squirts of water, then the check valve tore. I have always been a fan of MSR quality, and I think I will call to see if I can order the valve. Even with this problem, I still suggest it to people, but it you can afford the weight I will tell you to go with the full size filter."
5,Clean and Safe Water!,"Weighing in at only 1.4 pounds, this water filtration kit is the best. It easily pumps one quart in less than two minutes and attaches to standard `screw cap' plastic hiking bottles. Made out of a ceramic element, it catches even the most miniscule particles and prevents passage of any kind of microscopic parasite or germ. You can actually test this by filtering dark blue dyed (RIT, i.e.) water through to crystal clear water. The core is made out of black carbon, so any odors or chemical tastes are removed. The intake pre-filter sits just two inches below the floating inlet foam to avoid junk floating on the water surface. It is easily cleaned and compact. You can take this virtually anywhere and be guaranteed clean, fresh tasting water. A must for any serious backpacker, as fluid retention is extremely important at all times."
4,NICE PRODUCT,I HAVENT USED IT YET AND I WONT UNLESS I NEED IT.ITS IN MY BUG OUT BAG.I DID READ ALL THE REVIEWS BEFORE PURCHASING.IT SEEMS TO BE OF GOOD QUALITY AND I HAVE FAITH IY WILL WORK WELL.
3,OK product,"Would work great if you use nalgene bottles. Very dificult to use with canteens or any other container with a small opening. Takes what seems like forever to fill a 2 quart canteen! If this is the best one out there, then I just might go back to the drops..."
3,Works good for backpacking,"I purchased the MSR Miniwork Microfilter about one year ago and have been on three different week long backpack trips. It works well with moving water streams. The filter is easy to fill up a few bottles. If you are looking to filter gallons of water this is not your pump. I tried to filter a few gallons and you get tired from pumping. At times, water stops flowing and you need to readjust filter. It takes about 10 minutes for 3-4 bottles. I had to filter 10 gallons and used the iodine tablets."
5,MSR Water Filter-Excellent,Have used this on a couple of lakes. An inland lake that was somewhat smelly and Lake Superior. This filter worked great both times. The water tasted great and had no dead fish smell. Pumps fast and easy and is a no brainer to use.
5,Very Useful!,"This product is very helpful if you wish to play your djembe while sitting. It's sturdy, and with the rubber coating, it offers the drum a bit of protection from scratches. [It is also helpful for storage.]The stand raises the drum off the floor, which allows the sound hole to do its job more effectively --a fact that frees the drum's uniquely versatile ""voices"" for best playing, slaps, tones, and most especially, bass. This stand is the perfect companion to a Remo Festival Djembe 12."""
4,Very Pleased With Stand,"For the price this works very well. Great for sitting in front of drum and playing, would not recomend if you want to add this to a set of drums. I use this for playing in an accoustic setiing, when I am playing just my djembe. Really liked the price compared to other stands."
3,Bad Hero,"I too had issues with this hero. He is so quick to believe the worst of the heroine even though she has given him no reason to doubt her integrity. He treats her like dirt, is supposedly so proud, but he has no problem spending her money!"
5,The Entire Listening Experience,"Now we all know that there is nobody who can imitate Bjork, I don't believe these Artists were trying to imitate her, I think they just wanted to play in their own style of music. I thought the musicians did an outstanding job, after all it was A TRIBUTE, not a sound alike CD. Every Artist has their own way of expressing their art and these people deserve applause for their interpretations of Bjork. I hear music on this CD and think they are great artists. I am in no way critisizing the other reviews here, everyone's intitled to their own oppinions and I highly respect that, I just wanted to add my saybecause I love Bjork's sound, but I also love this CD that was a dedication to Bjork. I know they do not sound alike, but that is the fun of it for me, anyway.Spiritcavegrl-Artist"
2,CHEESEY BUT FUN,"OK, so it sounds cheap, tacky and cheesy but it but made me laugh!Don't buy this, expecting a very well made fantastic album or you will be upset.It's good for when you're in a bad mood and need cheering up!"
1,bblllaahhh,i guess this cd goes to show you no one can do bjorkother than bjork!!!!i want my money back!!!
2,Very....,"The first time I listened to this CD, I thought it was complete junk. The second time, I thought I had originally overreacted and actually enjoyed the first few tracks on it. The third time, I realized that the CD is lacking overall, and the last 3 tracks especially are complete junk compared to Bjork's standards.However, it was a cheap purchase, and that's keeping me from completely regretting it."
4,Intricate navy blue necklace,"On my computer screen the necklace showed up as having a variety of blue colors in it, mostly dark....however in person it's a pretty uniform true navy color (not as dark as I thought it would be). Be aware that this is not a sparkly necklace at all, as the stones aren't faceted. What makes it unique is the interesting way the stones are woven together on a thin, black metal wire...it adds a gorgeous look to your neckline. You really have to see it on your neck to appreciate the artful way the stones fall. While I generally prefer some sparkle to my necklaces, this is definitely unique enough to keep."
5,"Alternative comedy at it's best (or worst, depending on your point of view)","Ade Edmondson and Rik Mayall are often accused of playing the same characters over and over again and normally they are right. This is the exeption. Edmondson plays a kind of ""Anti-Vyvyian"" (If you haven't already seen the Young Ones, none of this will make sense to you.) Mayall does do another Rik but takes it somewhere really strange. I like this series best of them all."
5,Damn this is Wacky,"This is one of the funniest things I have ever watched. This is much more Young Ones than Bottom. If you like the Young Ones, spend a few bucks and get this, you will not be dissappointed. If you don't know its the same actors who play Rick, Neil, and Vyvyan.Its probably the wrong region for your DVD player, but the DVD software in your computer will probably be able to reset itself to let you watch it. Look into it. That is how I have to watch it."
4,A Deceptively Simple Little Book,"In addition to being a warm, poetic piece of writing, Kick It with Gusto is above all pragmatic. Its many bits of wisdom and practical advice are presented breifly and lucidly, making the book perfect for those whose concentration is compromised by suffering. Who has the energy to pore over lengthy treatises on the finer points of manic depressive disorder when it's all one can do to get out of bed in the morning? On the surface, much of what Sutz has to say in this wonderful little book may seem too trite or too simplistic to be effective. But take it from me: Kick It With Gusto is helpful. It is accessible. It is often beautiful. And it made me feel just a little bit better, which in my case is saying a lot."
2,Expensive Swarovski,I work with Swarovski on a regular basis and feel that this is expensive for 1 14mm Swarovski bead.
2,Dissapointed,"The concept was great. But after only a month or so, flaws started showing. The inserts started bending and warping, seperating at the edges and cracking. I purchased them for my Mother who gave them to my Daughter as a gift. She loved the idea, but will go back to the wooden boards because I don't think these will be around long. And they were not cheap either."
1,Good concept - POOR quality,"I bought this cutting board at Christmas 2006, and by March 2007 the board was warping and cracking on both sides.Great concept - but none of the plastic sheets totally fit in place, so we scrapped the plastic sheets and just used the cutting board without them. The board's rubber feet work VERY well, but the wood board is substandard - after fewer than 15 uses, it began to warp (FYI, this was as a result of regular washing by hand NOT in the dishwasher).I wrote an email to the manufacturer, and never heard back. Just crummy all the way around. Given the VERY high cost of this item, I was amazed at the poor quality. Never again will I buy a Furi product. Right now I am just using the board until it completely splits in half, then I will go out and buy a higher quality board from a more reputable manufacturer.Do NOT buy this item - you will be throwing your money away!"
4,Law School Review,"First of all the movie is AWESOME!!! I would recommend anyone who is even thinking about attending Law School to watch this movie. It had all sorts of great information but this particular dvd did skip. And it skipped the first time I ever watched it. I don't know if I got an old dvd or what. I thought I brought it new! Nevertheless, I'm still glad I got it!"
4,I'm feeling the feeling (and it's a good thing),"On paper, Roger Manning doesn't sound like anything the 60s didn't already deliver: a nasally, manic acoustic guitar player, with lyrics that alternate between chronicles of life as an impoverished New York City sub-folk boho and lefty political protests. So why is this album so good? Partly it's Manning's enthusiasm and sincerity, which gives his strange voice a verve and earnestness that is very appealing. Partly it's the tempering of the occasionally self-indulgent or strident lyrics with gorgeous love songs, like ""The 1010 Blues,"" ""The Pearly Blues"" or ""The Sicilian Train Blues."" After only a couple of albums, it seems Manning retired from the scene and is now working as a graphic designer. Perhaps he'll come out of retirement and teach these baby-faced boys with acoustic guitars a thing or two about how it's done."
2,Not my kind,The story here was just not to my liking. The mentally super-powered hero was overcome by a Pagan goddess and made to forget his lover. The lover follows his ex and his new love around Paris and Euro-Disney hoping for a chance to defeat the spell and the goddess. I could not buy the fact the super-heroes were so patient in letting one of their own behave in a hurtful way to his partner and himself. In the end we are to accept that the gods the pagans worship are humbled by them and will obey their edicts.
2,A word of warning...,"If you buy this CD based on the 5-star reviews here, I'm pretty sure you WILL be disappointed. I'll give you Fields in a nutshell: if Cream had been significantly less talented and took a lot of quaaludes, they could have made this album. There's a very good reason why this recording is obscure: it deserves to be. These guys aren't even as good as Stained Glass. Save your money."
4,Heavy prog of the 70s,"A really good heavy prog- and psyche (or acid) album, somehow reminds ""Rare Bird"", strongly influenced by ""Cream"". The band (Richard Fortunato, Patrick Burke, Steven Lagana) was from California, and was doomed to become another ""one album wonder"". If you're a fan of early 70s prog, get it, you won't regret it. Don't confuse it with British trio ""Fields"", who released an album (under the same title) in 1971 - that was Graham Field (of ""Rare Bird""), Andrew McCulloch (formerly of King Crimson) and Alan Barry (also with Crimson connections)- don't miss it."
4,Enjoyed using these,"These cutters were easy to use and gave many options. My only negative was that the biggest was almost too big. Wish I could have had the same shape, but scaled down a bit."
4,I celebrate Christmas for the cookies,"when you bake off a batch of these cookies, they are quite the showstopper! Sure, it may take 10 min to decorate one cookie, but it's worth it. The people who get these ""Martha-esque"" cookies have to be pretty special. Just don't use a recipe for pouffy cookies, the cut-outs won't be as noticable. I love to also gild them with gold and silver dragees, you know, those little metal looking balls. They say you should eat them, but hey, I've put worse things in my mouth."
3,"Quite average, really.","Very pretty and ultimately easy to use which is why I rated them ""average"" instead of less. I was less than thrilled that the finish came off with the first washing, even before I had ever used them! Rusty edges had to be cleaned off. I didn't have time to replace them, so I made them work, but I would certainly never buy them again."
3,Difficult to use; too big,"I have seen pictures of exquisitely decorated cookies using this kind of set but I would REALLY like to see the outtakes, like when the little holes were cut just a smidgen off, or the whole thing broke as it was transfered to the cookie sheet. The learning curve on this is long and slow. Also, how many people want to eat a cookie that is 6 inches across?"
5,renewal of magazin e,The magazine was a gift last year and I appreciated to renew the gift this year
4,Jessy revs up again,"Jessy's enthusiasm for praising the Lord is catching when you view this video - I learned something new, too. I didn't realize he was an accomplished gospel pianist; that guy has it all!"
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,"I bought this item because it seemed to have OK reviews. I recieved the item in a flimsy box. All items were in the box, so no problem. It was easy to assemble, great. I used it on flat land for about 15 minutes and the spindle broke resulting in the spreader not spreading. This item is made with plastic wheels and assembly that is not reliable. This item will break in a short period of time. I will now go purchase a better quality spreader. It may cost more but I am sure that it won't be made from poor quality hardware like this one. Save yourself the trouble and do not waste your time/money on this product."
3,Carl's Seed Spreader Review,Packing looked as though a two year old had just dumped his tool box into a cardboard box.Directions were not as hard to follow as I expected them to be.Seems to work if you limit the amount of product you place into it.Exceptable for a cheep unit
1,broke spreader,"I thought Made in the US of A meant quality. Used it one time, got it out to use it again & the axle was froze up & I ruined a big spot in my lawn."
3,Risky,"Poorest packaging of anything from Amazon.Parts are just dumped in a very light weight cardboard box.Part list was not the same as parts included. It did come with enoughpart to assemble spreader, I guess FedEx knows how handle cheap packaging"
2,"OK, but parts missing",Received the product to find one part pushed out bare through side of box. Once I opened box I found two further holes and 2 parts that were missing. Called the number and they said parts would be overnighted..I am waiting to see. Product looks reasonable but I don't know if it will last that long. If I do not receive parts wihin a day I will return it. Did receive parts and was able to put together. Looks ok and seems to work.
5,Worked great!,"Took about 20 minutes to install, resolved the trouble code for the O2 sensor on my 2002 Highlander with 155k."
1,Oxygen Sensor,"After very careful review of this product and carefully making sure it was the correct item for my 2002 Toyota Highlander V-6, I received it in the mail.But after comparing the old Sensor with the new sensor, i realized they sent me the wrong part?????? I sent it back within 30 days and in new condition.But, thet did NOT Refund me the exact cost of the New Sensor. I felt cheated. They should have refunded me fully. It was their fault in sending me the wrongOxygen Sensor."
3,Very poor packing for a fragile electronic part!,Item arrived in a very poor packing. Packing box had no bubble wrap and no tape at open ends to secure part from falling out.Luckily there was no damage. Installed and it works well so far.
1,Poor sentence structure and confusing text ruin this book.,"A terrific subject, with a great deal of research done by the author. However, it is hardly readable! The author wrote the longest, most drawn out sentences I have EVER read. The result is confusion. The author is unable to complete one thought at a time and as a result, neither can you. I rate this one a snoozer. A good sleeping pill. Too bad. I was really looking forward to reading it. He should fire his editor."
1,"Poor Writing, Poor Editing = Bad Biography","Isabella Stewart Gardner was a fascinating character and I wish the author had stuck to writing about her. Instead, he stuffed the book with stories about events in HIS OWN life, his own 20th century moralizing about the late 19th century, and even dozens (hundreds?) of quotes from famous people about other famous people that he determined could also be applied to Isabella Stewart Gardner. (Did I mention the ridiculously long and confusing sentences that a good editor should have thrown out?) Astonishingly, the author has managed to make the story of an extraordinary life into an extraordinarily boring book."
1,Enough with the !!!,"I was so excited to read this book that I ordered it as soon as it came out! I could hardly wait to get home (!) to start it!! As interested and as motivated I was to read this book, the author's non-stop use of the exclamation point finally made me put the book down after only 3 chapters. This is the first book I have read that I felt the author's punctuation got in the way of telling a great story. I am angry about buying this book only to find it too annoying to read."
2,The writing almost (emphasis added) ruined it for me.,"I agree with many of the other reviewers - this is a poorly written book. I cannot believe it was actually published in this form. What he attempts as prose comes across as a jumbled and incoherent mess - and I've read authors (Saramago for example) who succeed with long sentences and strange punctuation. However, as horrendous as the writing was, the subject matter did manage to keep me reading. All told, I cannot wait to visit the museum. I have not been in 12 years and look forward to seeing it again armed with my new knowledge of ISG."
1,Was there no editor?,"Gardner is an interesting personality. The book is written in a stilted, over punctuated style that makes it nearly impossible to read. And did I mention the zillion exclamation points???!!!!!!! A conversation with the author must be very tiring."
1,Feigned eloquence and inflated ego torture the reader,"When you have to spend 10 minutes rereading a sentence to fully understand it's intent, a problem exists. Shand I fear purposefully writes in this manner because he is assuming himself to be eloquent, quite the contrary. Apart from extremely convoluted sentences, he has a habit of phrasing things in the negative thereby obscuring what could have been a VERY READABLE sentence in the affirmative. The use of exclamation points reached its limit surely in the first few chapters.Furthermore, Shand has an extremely annoying habit of inserting himself into the biography which is completely inappropriate. For instance in a discussion of Gardener in the role of a muse, Shand inserts commentary on his own author/muse relationship."
1,Ugh again,"Just returned from a trip to Boston...during a dinner party in Cambridge, the following was overheard:Harvard professor: ""...my wife was reading a book about I.S. Gardner, but said it was so bad, she couldn't go on...""It sounded familiar, and then I recalled this awful book. Sure enough, it was the same."
5,Great for rescue,"Bought this to carry as my rescue knife on the fire department, and we cover a large area of Interstate highway so we get a lot of wrecks, and this thing is amazing. It cuts through any seat belt or air bag with almost no effort. Flips out fast and easy to handle with extrication gloves on. I don't leave the station without it."
5,Excellent review of a forgotten king,"Swedes tend to jump from Charles X Gustav to his grandson Charles XII, forgetting Charles XI. But this was one of Sweden's greatest kings. He broke the aristocratic oligarchy, shored up Crown finances and reorganised the civil service, the army and the navy. Most of all, he kept the peace for 25 years when Sweden was large but poor and all its neighbours were anxious to lay their hands on choice parts of it. Many of his reforms lasted until well into the 20th century and some are still relevant today. Charles XII may have been glamorouos, but he foolishly lost an empire. Charles XI may have been a bore, but he preserved it all his life!"
5,Luxury!,"I have NEVER spend so much money on a lotion, but I had heard so much about this product that I decided to spoil myself. This lotion defines luxury! it is the ultimate pampering of oneself. I usually put it on at night after my bath & I sleep like a baby, breathing deeply & truly enjoying the the scent and feel of being relaxed & transformed. For the average person it is not an everyday lotion, as it will end up costing a bundle, but it is for those nights (or days) that you need to treat yourself like a princess."
4,a brilliant album..,"..from Stellar. Contains the hits What You Do, Part of Me and Volient. A terrific album and a must have for your collection"
4,THE BAND OF Y2K,I was thought VIOLENT was so explosive when I heard it on the radio it's one of those songs you can't get out of your head and I think that the group have made there best album so far and look forward to hearing them live when they come to the U.K. I think the whole album from start to finish was brilliant and will take the band into the y2k. A must for every fan.
4,New Zealand band makes good,"This album deserves to go places. It's world class. Sadly, because they are from New Zealand they may find themselves not listened to where it matters. Six tracks charted here and they supported Alanis Morisette in Australia. They are in the studio recording their second album now. But don't overlook this one.'Part of me' started the chart run and has a great hook. They really rock on 'Violent' and 'What You do'.A well-kept secret. I'm still not tired of it after a year of listening. Buy it and check them out..."
5,Awesome Kiwis,"Very polished, but still punchy and raw. Much like Garbage, but with a slightly smoother sound. However they can still rock as shown on the single Violent. Look forward to their next album - they deserve to be heard widely......this is a top album and it would be a great shame if it weren't distibuted so that everyone could hear it. Awesome !!!"
5,Gee,"It's only $15.95 on eBay. 80 something dollars is nuts, especially when I know very well the band won't see those royalties. It is supposed to be their best though from what I have heard."
3,average,"This cd was just average, nothing spectacular about it. I am an earth crisis fan but this one just didnt do it for me. buy this cd if ur a fan, but not if u never heard them, buy breed the killers or the oath that keeps me free. Those are better cds"
4,"Beautiful, haunting","A beautiful, haunting story. Love/obsession that may be only what it's perceived to be, or maybe not. By far the best of Duras' early works. A book I knew I'd have to read again before I even finished the first time."
2,Disappointing.,"The crate was damaged upon arrival and 2 of the spices were open (all the others were sealed in bags within the metal containers). Thinking this was a defective (or previously opened item) I sent it back.Amazon promptly exchanged the item, but the same 2 item were (again) not sealed. I don't know about you, but when I buy things I plan to eat, I like to know they have not been tainted on their way to my kitchen! (Especially since the crate itself doesn't arrive shrink wrapped.)Also, I was disappointed in that there were only 2 recipes provided! Not all of the spices in the kit were even used in the recipes! I ordered this as a gift and had to go back and order a cookbook to go along with it so the recipient could DO SOMETHING with this!"
1,"""No War"" is a fraud, its not by Naomi Klein","""No War"" by the way its cover is designed gives the illusion of being a new book by Naomi Klein. I can assure you that it is not. Don't waste your money on it. It is simply a repackaged version of something that Klein has been offering for free on her website for months. It originally was an article that appeared in Harper's magazine entitled: ""Baghdad Year Zero."" I am the photographer that traveled to Iraq with Klein and took the pictures to illustrate the story, so I know. Don't buy this book and support an unethical publisher who in their own small minded way are trying to profit off of the war in a microcosm of the same way that is described in Klein's writing about the original war profiteers. Instead, go to nologo.org, Klein's website, and read her statement about this book, where you can download this article for free."
1,Useless Left-Wing rhetoric,"More diatribe from the left, which should be a title of a chapter in Klein's silly short book on the Iraq War. She has more political hang ups than a dry cleaner. She simply is out of touch with reality, and is driven insane by emotional outbursts that destroy any effort at objectivity. Some of her arguments in this, and other efforts, are so ridiculous that it's hard to imagine anyone ever giving her an audience. It's truly the blind leading the blinder. Read this book if nothing more than to see how bankrupt the anti-war movement is."
3,Quality hardcore punk,"Go It Alone plays hardcore the way its been played for ages, which is fast. There are only a few gang vocal parts, but plenty of 2-stepping parts for all you dancers out there. The album starts out with the sound of rain falling, and the album is closed the same way, only its extended and you hear the rumbling of thunder as the rain picks up. This is an interesting way to end the album since they are from Vancouver, which is considered Rain City. One thing that elevates them above typical hardcore bands is the lyrics, which are outstanding especially on Shallow Breathing and Nobody But You. This is a breath fresh of air since most hardcore has the same subpar lyrics about ""unity"", scene politics, and other running themes that never seem to go away. The thing that plagues the album is the sameness of the songs, but they have plenty of energy, and the lyrics help distinguish one song from the next."
1,Terrible toy and breaks very very easily!!!,Bought this item for my husband and went through so many rotor blades that I could open my own company. The mosquito helicopter is very very delicate and so are the rotor blades! This is not at all for a child! It is very flimsy and not a good choice!!
3,A brief introduction,"It is a thin book with a brief introduction on the life of Rabia of Basra. If you don't know anything about this mystic of islam then you may want to read this short introduction, otherwise the book is not for you. It also covers the major aspects of her life, and famous sayings."
3,Better than nothing,"There is not a lot that's great about this CD, and there's nothing here that would make this a necessary purchase for anyone other than a die-hard Mason fan. Still, most of the songs are good, and Dave's singing and playing is as brilliant as ever. Only the title track and the gorgeous Phoebe Snow duet ""Dreams I Dream"" standout above the mess of drum machines and synthesizers that really dogs this album and with only 8 songs clocking in at under 35 minutes, this is hardly a value filled album.Nevertheless, a (very) bad Mason album is still better than no Mason at all, which is pretty much what we've had since this album came out 15 years ago. But if you don't yet have any Mason be warned that this is definitely NOT the place to start - get ""Alone Together"" and ""Long Lost Friend""."
1,Stay away from this one,"Dave Mason's energy, style, passion, and musical brillance are no where to be found on this light-weight, late-80s recording. Treat yourself, instead, to ""Alone Together"". It is magnificent, and captures Dave Mason at his very best."
5,Michael ROCKS!,"He just ROCKS! there's nothing too much more to say. He stays true to his soul in writing rock n roll, he don't sell out, he has a story worth saying & he tells it, the only thing left is for him to leave a powerful legacy by influencing someone (like me) and that someone paying him homage in there writing style, thrusting him to greatness that is long overdue."
1,Doesn't work with Win 2000,"Although the description states that this game is compatible with Windows in general, it does not work with Win 2000, and I would bet NT or XP. The infogrames site only lists 95/98. Since the infogrames site does not list Trivial pursuit as an active title, having just an agreement to support it with Hasbro, its erstwhile maker, I would not expect that they will do anything about updating it to support current Windows systems anytime soon."
5,music from Northeast Brasil,"xangai plays and sings music from the Northeast of Brasil. It is like a folkloric version of commercial forro music (sort of). It also sounds a bit like the music from the popular Brazilian film Central Station (Central do Brasil), or even zydeco. Don't expect bossa nova, or smooth tropical music--this is music from the desert. Some songs are very beautiful, and the rythms are swingin. Xangai does some cool vocal effects, and the lyrics are a good introduction to Northeastern dilaect and slang."
4,another set of great riffs,"i have heard him on ufo,,,,, msg and now on this cd,,,,, the best track is number 8 :lightning riffs: will now require a relisten to the cassettes with macauley to get the fine points,this is an interesting cd and will take careful attention to get all the notes and sequences. As others have said he uses a variety of moods , rhythms ,,,,,,, i imagine at many concerts he expands on the basic themes of any of these cuts..... remember : number 8 is the best one on this"
4,Slingo,"Fun game, we already had this game but couldnt find it so I ordered another one. Then we found the other one after we got this one."
1,Won't work on Windows ME,Won't work on Windows ME and if you call Hasbro tech they no longer support it and give you Q&A recordings. No human to talk with. Not recommended if you use Windows ME.
5,First time player and love it!,"This was recommened to me by Amazon so I thought I would try it. I thought it would be ok, but it is so much fun and very addicting! The variety of 5 games keeps it interesting. I've had it over the weekend and have filled up the top scores in all categories. A fun game!"
3,Animals - 'Live At The Club A Go-Go' (Griffin),"I think I may've done a review of this CD for a printed 'zine several years back.Either way,'Live At...' is a seven track archive recording of the band BEFORE they had any hits as it took place on Dec.30,1963.Pretty much every tune is a cover,like two Chuck Berry songs,""Let It Rock"" and ""Almost Grown"" as well as two John Lee Hooker covers ""Dimples"" and ""Boom Boom"".Then we cannot forget the Duke Ellington number ""C Jam Blues"" or Ellas McDaniel's ""Bo Diddley"".Not a bad sounding rarity that someone had apparently dug out of their closet,stash box,basement,etc.Good quality British invasion rock n'roll.Original line up is here:Eric Burden-vocals,Hilton Valentine-guitar,Chas Chandler-bass(R.I.P.-hey,wasn't he the one who discovered Hendrix?),Alan Price-keyboards and John Steel-drums."
5,Still Phunkee - Even harder and Phunk-ier,Who doesn't love the Phunk Junkeez? This album is classic Junkeez with the added heavier guitar of Danny P... he shreds and adds a kick to the older Junkeez albums. Buy this album.
3,"Awesome series, bad DVD quality",I'm a big GS and GSD fan. I bought this volume since the one that came in the box set had a few 'defective' episodes that would just not play and would freeze the DVD player. I thought that buying the volume separetely woulf fix this and it did and it didn't; intead of having 3 messed up episodes it only has 1 messed up episode. I guess it's an improvement but it would defenitively be better if it had NO messed up episodes. I'm starting to beleive that all of them came defective...
5,absolutely love this,"i bought this blanket for my little girl. she absolutely loves everything horses. she was so excited when she saw it. great quality, so i know it will last for years. glad i bought it!!"
4,Strong Pop Rock,"As an Ani fan I was not sure what to expect when I picked this CD up. At first I was surprised (disappointed?) at what a commercial sound it seemed to have - THEN I listened a little more. This is a very good CD. The songs are lyrically very strong, 22 Steps is my favorite. Many reviewers have commented on his voice, some friends have asked Is that Bono? New U2? No this is not a U2 album! Frankly, Andy Stochansky has his own intelligent voice and a wonderfully accessible sound. A very enjoyable album."
1,"Somebody's Trying to Clothe this Emperor, At Your Expense","I had a vasectomy shortly before reading this book, and had the same ""please let it be over"" feeling during the last 100 pages. It starts out okay--if you're from the ""incomplete sentences are art"" school of literary thought. But ultimately the characters are uninteresting, shallow, and portrayed as unforgiveably stupid, apparently without the author recognizing their stupidity. This could be a good book to give a teenager on how not to do almost anything in connection with structuring and writing a novel."
1,Should Have Stayed Lost,This is undoubtedly the worst piece of historical fiction I have ever encountered. It is so bad that it is pointless to apply the usual elements of literary analysis. It generates the kind of morbid fascination one feels when looking at a particularly repulsive animal.
4,Some very vivid writing.,"The writing in this book really comes alive. The first page smacked me across the face, and it made me want to read more. There is one section that was so sad, strange, and so wonderfully done that I had to read it again and again. I didn't feel that it completly achieved all that it wanted to, or at least what I think it wanted to, but some parts of it were so good, that it totally makes reading it worthwhile."
5,Pioneer Stock,"I'm a big fan of authors who write so well you enjoy the journey and let the ending come in the author's own sweet time. Lost Nation is one of those and man, what a journey. Primal and tender. None of the characters travels a smooth road."
2,Verbose to the point of stupefaction,"No question, Lent can write. But this? The plot seems derived from old movies (oaters mostly), the story itself boiled over Faulkner. And that's my gripe. Lent should lay off the Faulkner imitation and find out who HE is. Faulkner's done his time, and we don't need to see him paroled. To those reviewers who were transported by this particular novel--and that appears to be most of them--I suggest the Snopes Trilogy.To tell the truth, until I read this I thought Pynchon's Mason and Dixon wasn't much. Even when I didn't like it, I had to admit it was hysterical. That's something else Lent could use: humor. It's a hallmark of American letters."
1,Disappointment,"I enjoy historical fiction. However this book was very disappointing. Under the guise of being ""mysterious"" the characters are poorly developed. The story line has potential but never goes anywhere. Most of the action seems very contrived and pointless. None of the characters is in any way sympathetic. By the end of the book I just wanted them all to die.Finally the writing is just plain bad. This book contains so many gramatical errors and poorly structured sentences that sometimes I had to read a section multiple times to figure out what the writer meant to say.I had to force myself to finish this novel."
1,Disappointed,"I had read all the IRS publications and had filled out form 1023 as best I could before I purchased the book. I had hoped to find information on the relative importance of the questions, some useful tips, short cuts, etc. It was a waste of my money. I did not learn anything that was not made perfecetly clear in the IRS pubs and on the Instructions for form 1023 (but my application did not require any of the Schedules)."
3,Thunderstrike by Michael McCollum,"I loved the concept & the story overall, but it was much too easy to get bogged down in the scientific details. I love sci-fi that rings true & possible, but too much scientific evidence makes me wish the story would just move on! The escape from Luna was exciting & believable & the main characters were fairly well developed. You got to like Thorpe very much & Amber somewhat although she was an egg-head at times & too naive for the most part. Overall, I think it was worth the read."
3,"rare: yes, interesting: maybe...","the biggest disappointment was at first the fact that the cd was not mixed, or at least there wasnt a separate mixed version CD like dimitri has done before (i had this item pre-ordered). I guess that half the value of dimitri's cds is that they are mixed, so u can play them at a party and have a certain degree of grooviness going.. Other than that, the cd is exactly what the two men describe: a sincere attempt to share their viniyl rarities (a little bit re-touched though) with the rest of us, whether this is over-rated or not.."
4,"Wallace matters, so this book matters","I felt I got a well-rounded view of Wallace as a person from this book. And I felt the treatment was fair, fairer than I expected from an arch-skeptic of and enemy of anything spiritual, Wallace's ""weakness."" Omitted, though, was adequate coverage of some of Wallace's strongest arguments against natural selection. As I understand it, Wallace said that the talents induced in us by civilization must have been built into our species at inception, but through not being useful prior to civilization should have been lost through disuse, here following Darwin's terminology. A good argument. Just as the author gets here the discussion shifts onto sexual selection and ""the problem of incipient stages,"" as if the author's nerve failed. Otherwise I thought this a good ""life."""
3,Oxford University Press pricing!,"Others have commented on the contents, so I will comment on production values. The book is nicely produced, with a generous supply of useful illustrations. BUT! Don't pay Oxford University Press's exorbitant price ($50 list), shop for a good used copy instead. When OUP first published this in 2002 it was $35 (list), so they've increased it by $15 in just 7 years.I always feel sad when an author like Shermer has the availability of his book limited by a rapacious (or maybe just inefficient?) publisher like OUP."
4,A decent product,This particular Country Life product is of decent quality but is no longer my first choice for Vitamin B complex. I'd buy it only if the Bluebonnet were not available.
5,Harry Potter Backpack (purple?),"I searched everywhere for an Harry Potter school bag for my daughter and the only one I could find was on amazon U.S, although the shipping was very expensive I was prepared to pay as this was a birthday present. Even though my daughter was delighted with the bag, I felt a little disappointed that it was a jean bag that arrived and not a purple one as I ordered and thaught I was going to receive. Arrived on time and my daughter was happy."
2,mistake,"Looks cool, sure wish I would have received what I ordered. I ordered this for my daughter's first day of kindergarten, she was very excited. Then I receive the black one in the mail. Very disappointed...and not very good quality. Very flimsy."
3,cedar baking plank,The cedar plank is a good product but I was disappointed that the product did not include a cook book or a device to tighten the bolts that need to be tightened. I bought a cedar plank years ago that included both the cookbook and device to tighten the bolts.....these were bought for gifts and I think the person who got them may have trouble using them without more instruction.
4,Great for someone new to PCOS,"I was recently diagnosed with PCOS and am glad I ordered this book. I'm sure it's not as indepth as others, but it is a great book to start off with if you are new to PCOS. It is very easy to read and easy to understand. It really helps you understand the symptoms of PCOS and the different ways they can be treated. After reading this book, I don't feel so overwhelmed with my condition and I feel like I am ready to move on to a more indepth book."
2,Living with PCOS? Look somewhere else!,"This book had no more info in it than I found on the internet. Way too basic, and little coping skills offered. Reads like an english paper. I suppose if you are interested in the fertilitly part- you may like this book, as that is a huge section. This went into NO detail on treatment options and was VERY dry."
3,Good Intro to PCOS,"This was an easy read with good background info on PCOS. If you've already done alot of research, you won't find anything new here, but it is an extremely helpful book for the newly diagnosed or those who want general info regarding PCOS. Does have good info about PCOSA (support association)."
2,"too basic, not comprehensive",I did not like this book at all since it had very limited explination of what PCOS is about and treatment options.
2,Semi-Helpful,"If your interested in looking for alternative therapies for PCOS this isn't the book to get. It was helpful in explaining and detailing the Syndrome but when it came to alternatives they leaned more towards perscribed medication and western medicine being the more wise route to take in healing and controlling PCOS Symptoms.Side effects for Prescribed medication were also left out in this book. If there was mention, then it was that blatant that it went un-noticed by me."
4,A Good Compendium,"I recently purchased this book. I have done a great deal of research on PCOS, but I wanted to have a book at home that would provide me an all-in-one source about this disorder. My friends ask for info, as does my family. This is a great book if you need a through, yet basic overview of PCOS. It also covers alternative treatments...which I really liked! Now I know the reasons why my doctor (who uses a combination of traditional and holistic medicine) suggests or prescribes certain medications! A good book!"
4,great for overall information,"This book was very easy to read (in fact, I finished it in about an hour). This is very good for those who want to get background information on PCOS and see what types of tests, etc. they should have their doctors give them to find out if they have PCOS. It may also be helpful to have continual yearly check-ups to monitor the status of your PCOS and this book lists the various tests that can be done (though you might also be able to find those tests off the PCOS Association website). If you already have a lot of background information on PCOS, I would skip this book as you probably already know what is in it."
5,This is a must read for anyone with PCOS,"If you've been diagnosed with PCOS you must read this book. It is the definitive book for PCOS. Contains information about the many different treatment options available, and gives hope to people who are feeling hopeless. Don't suffer alone. There are others out there going through the same things you are. Take strength, get educated, and don't accept treatments that aren't working for you."
3,"Easy to understand, but not comprehensive enough...","Very simple to understand for the newly diagnosed... but if you are the slightest bit knowledgeable about PCOS, this book won't do. There are clear, but generic explanations for the hows and whys of your bodies processes, and the role of hormones and how hormone imbalance will affect your entire body. There are also some good tips on how to deal! So if you have some of the symptoms and wonder if this might be you, or if you have just been diagnosed, you can get some general information here in an easy to understand format...If you already know much about this syndrome and are looking for answers, I would look elseware!"
5,A must have for family care givers and professionals,This book is a must have for any family care giver or professional looking for a way to help with end of life issues. The format allows the caregiver to be guided through the end of life process and to think about caring for their loved one in ways that would never occur to someone who has not been involved in the end of life process. The design of the book is innovative. It allows for caregivers to journal their thoughts and feelings and to have something to look back on. I also had the opportunity to hear Mr. Sapienza speak and I am in awe of his sensitivity and compassion in an arena that is so often hard for us to enter. I work with family care givers and often give this book to them to begin their journey with their loved ones.
1,Don't Waste Your Money,I purchased this product as a gift for my son for Christmas. No matter what I do it will not install on my new computer that uses Windows Me. I have tried to contact the mfg but there phone is constantly busy and they do not answer emails for technical support. If you have a new computer do not expect it to install.
5,Awesome Game!!!!,"I love the game sorry because I love the boardgame and this game puts a whole new twist into it. The pieces move by the click of a mouse, no need to worry about bending over!!! It's so simple, yet fun to play!!!!!"
2,Fun game,This works fine on my XP computer but the color of pawns mess up a little bit so you sometimes can't see them on the board only only half of a pawn is showing but the game still runs great and all the pawns talk and do their own antics as they move to another space or leave their start or when they head home or into the safe zone.
4,This CD aged a little,"""Drive Inn II"" is one of only two albums by Rainer Bloss that are available in the USA. Bloss contributed to a few of Klaus Schulze's albums in the early 80s - including the memorable concert album recorded in Poland: ""Dziekuje Poland"".The album is the sequel to ""Drive Inn I"" by Bloss and Schulze. This time the resulting music is much better and much nicer in every way. Every composition has a beginning, a middle carrying tune and an end. No, don't laugh - ""Drive Inn I"" does not have this property! Although this CD aged a little and some compositions seem cheesy, you will find some pearls that make the purchase worth its price. The best example would be the first track: ""Long Way to Acapulco"". In fact, this ingenious track justfies purchase on its own.Recommended for people with experimental mood or for those who miss the music of the early 80s."
5,Coyote Tales,"I admit I may be a bit prejudiced, as Micheal Ballam is my Music Instructor here at USU, but I really really like this music. It is unlike ANYTHING I have ever heard. The Indian, or Native American as we say, sounds mixed in with the European instruments create a most unique experience.It just feels different and different is good."
5,Excellent Read,"This quirky little book was an excellent read. It was offbeat and funny, but had an element of sadness to it. The tone of the book reminds me of a Harry Crews novel. I would definitely recommend this one."
1,ammonia smell makes eyes tear,We have been using 'Feline Pine' for 7+ years. While purchasing more litter I decided to try 'Yesterdays News'. After our 1 cat uses the box the ammonia smell is overpowering and makes our eyes tear. Solid doesn't appear to cause as much of a smell. The litter box is scooped out several times a week and disinfected every couple months. 'Yesterdays News' is recycled newspapers and I wanted to help the environment. 'Feline Pine' is 100% pure pine and the difference between these two is dramatic. We have never had any litter box odor with 'Feline Pine' and it's easy to clean. The only con is our cat tracks a small amount of the pellets. I cannot recommend 'Yesterdays News' litter and wouldn't give it any stars if that was an option. I realize this is not a review for 'Feline Pine' yet I must say it is the only litter we will ever use and highly recommend.
2,"A for effort, but ...","This stuff was recommended to me by my vet after my cat had surgery on his paw. I had never paid much attention to ALL the different types of kitty litter at the store, but I popped for a bag. My first reaction was wow, these little pellets are hard. But in fact they do absorb urine just as hoped/desired.Solids, another issue. They just sit on the surface, my cats won't or can't cover them up. So I was scooping more often, and because the pellets are quite large they don't pass through the slots on the scoop. Became quite the procedure to get just the solids and leave the pellets.Recently one of the cats stopped pooping in the box and used the carpet instead. I took this as a sign that he too was tired of this product that sounds so promising. Back to traditional clay I go (which, according to a book I read, is what cats are used to texture-wise anyway). 2 stars for the effort."
4,rio's women of the world,"This was an awesome video. I recently got volume 1 in the mail and it was everything I expected it to be. I have just placed an order for the second volume. I along with 3 other friends are going to rio after the first of the year. The funny thing is that I have other friends that have been and everywhere they told me to go while in rio, was actually featured on the video. I would recommend this video to all guys. Not only did it showcase some of the worlds most exotic women but was also very informative. A must have!"
5,a paradise taste,"That's a wonderful CD that impressed me very much. From the debut single, 'Good-bye my loneliness', IZUMI SAKAI, the vocalist of ZARD tries new things and makes each songs unique. Like this one, 'Love and peace', American black music is introduced, and also the rap.You can't know why she can take this kind of music to Japanese songs, and is so successfully transformed. It's a brand new taste for ZARD fans, including me.And also the name, love and peace is one of the hottest issues around the world. Without these two, the planet would not be so good and nice. What a sensetive Japanese singer-songwriter she is!For someone who hasn't try her music, it's a start for you to get the paradise taste!"
4,Another Brick in the Wall,"When talking about the relatively recent phenomenon of state schooling in the history of mankind, the U.S. experience is said to have been initiated by Anglo-Saxon Protestants in reaction to Catholic immigrants and their schools. But Joel Spring writes that ""A factory-like system in the nineteenth-century schoolroom was not accidental"". These government indoctrination centers were designed to not only produce obedient, tax-paying citizens but also obedient factory workers. Teachers had little say in what their students would learn; they did not even have the opportunity to choose classroom texts - these were chosen by officials, not teachers.This book covers a dynamic period in the history of state schooling. If you agree with Pink Floyd's plea - ""We don't want no thought control"", you'll like this book."
4,Forget Stephen King...,"Well, maybe not...The book was informative. I'll give it that. But it just didn't hold your attention. Though, I can't say this detracts too much from it because the topic just isn't something you can make very interesting.Spring goes over many people's ideas about how schools should be run and ties it together with how factories came to be run to show that schools are a sort of training center to pump out workers like they're a sort of product. It's well documented and I did find some of the ideas, like vocational guidance pointing kids not where they'd be happiest but where they'll help the economy most, intriguing.Given what he had to write about, I can give it four stars... But don't expect to lose yourself in this one..."
4,New Author With Promise,You will immediately become drawn into the lives of all of the characters in this delightful story. Bravo to Ms. Waters! Hopefully we will see the continuation of this style of writing in future books to come.
5,Absolutely delightful! Wasey does a remarkable job.,"Wasey describes the history and methods of gathering sap from the Sugar Bush (stands of maple trees) and creating syrup from them. She tells the story in a simple, straightforward and intelligent way that young readers will appreciate. I read this book to my 4-year-old son frequently, and he LOVES it, responding with all sorts of questions and comments. The book itself is elegantly illustrated with lots of photos and artwork, and the entire presentation takes a subject that is very foreign to many young people and makes it interesting and inspiring.Parents who want children to learn meaningful ethics and be inspired by real-life young people will appreciate the work put into this book."
3,Goodie Mob should get back together,"As a fan of the DF, Goodie Mob, and OutKast, it makes me shudder to have to listen through a decent, but not great, solo effort provided by Big Gipp. The Mob used to churn out classics like they were Big Macs. But, that was a day in the past and now we have to deal with the Lumberjacks and 'Lo on his own (though he is fine alone, by all means). Anyway, Gipp spits through a lengthy 16 tracks and does a decent job throughout. I would say that he put forth more effort lyrically on his solo album than he did on One Monkey Don't Stop No Show. ""Steppin Out"" is great. ""Boogie Man"" is interesting. But the CD blends together too much and becomes somewhat monotonous, and not at all extravagant. Mob fans get it, though it might disappoint you just a little bit."
2,the flow was tight the Music missing,Big Gipp has SKills for days.in fact I was always more into Goodie Mob a Bit more than Outkast over time.Big Gipp has alot of depth&touches on alot of subject matter that should be heard&never forgotten.especially the Atlanta Child Murders that still takes me back.but the music&Grooves overall don't have enough bite to them.but still worth hearing for Gipps presentation.
3,expected more,"Mutant Mindframe is a dissapointment cus i expected a lot more coming from a goodie mob member. the intro to the cd is the one of the few places gipp says anything on the album, and the rest of the cd unfolds like a pop nelly or 50 cent album. If he makes any videos for any tracks they could compete with britney and n sync on trl for the top spot. if you have the money, then i say buy this cd cus its still big gipp, but he couldve put out a lot better of an album"
4,Get the newer version,I just got the newer version in the mail today. It is about 8 years more recent. Similar material and price but the newer version seems to have broken up some of the chapters into smaller pieces.
2,Ante-Post ?,I bought this CD with hopes that it would as bright and hopefully better then Carmina Burana... With much disappointment I have listened to this CD... It is a collection of Church Choir Music... It doesn't have the spunk or energy of Carmina Burana...
5,Another awesome BBC video!,"From the people that brought you Planet Earth, the series ""Wonders of the Solar System"" takes you through our solar system and its creation in a way that is easy to understand. The program is gorgeous to look at, and hosted in an engaging way by particle physicist Brian Cox. A must have for science lovers! Also, purchase the later edition to the series, ""Wonders of the Universe"". You won't be disappointed!"
5,Inspiring!,"My wife and I were able to catch this program on TV while overseas. It is the most fascinating, inspiring, and entertaining science program I've ever seen. Can't wait for the DVD release. The host, Brian Cox, is a physicist, and his delight and wonder regarding the topics in the show are infectious. I can't recommend this enough!"
2,Mediocre,"There are some beautiful shots and interesting insights in Wonders of the Solar System, but ultimately this is a deeply flawed series. The most glaring problem is that the camera is on Brian Cox way too much. I paid to learn about the solar system, not look at a physicist. A secondary problem is the excessive focus on Earth. There are 8 planets in the solar system but all of them except for earth get very short shrift. On the plus side, the picture quality is great."
5,Unbelievable,"I thoroughly enjoyed this series. Brian Cox is amazing with the way he delivers mid-blowing facts in such a casual and understandable way. He truly makes the show as his passion, respect, and love for the cosmos becomes really contagious. I recommend this to anyone who like learning about the universe, but wants something a little more serious than ""The Universe"". You gotta check out ""Wonders of the Universe"" as well. Cox kills it in that series, too. Unbelievable."
4,Not bad,My favorite part of the series is when he says geysers but pronounces it geezers. I like this documentary but I think the History channel one is better.
2,Quite disappointed,"I think this is the first time I'm so disappointed with a BBC title. This is really ""The Brian Cox Show"". For a series that should be about the solar system, about 90% of the footage is shot on location around the Earth, and somebody obviously loved putting Prof. Cox on screen most of the time. For example, it is a good idea to illustrate Enceladus' ice fountains with a geyser in Iceland. But do we really need several minutes of the professor posing in front of said geyser? how about some computer graphics showing theories on how the fountains work?For an astronomy buff like myself (e.g. I watched the pictures being downloaded from the Huygens probe the day it landed on Titan) this set offered little of value. I'm only glad I got it from the library and I fast forwarded through most of it. If I had paid for it I would have been angry!"
2,Incredibly boring,"I borrowed this DVD set from my local library. After over 4 hours, I'm just glad that I didn't pay a penny for it. It's just incredibly boring. Most of the imagery is taken from Earth! The presenter, one ""professor Cox"" from Britain, is just not a credible presenter; he doesn't even seem excited about the stuff he's telling us, despite the many uses of superlatives. My idol Tom Cruise would have done a much better job! The materials drift here and drift there, as there's no inherent theme over the five or six episodes. One feels the producers are just padding the program with empty stuff, like many people do with their resumes and Amazon.com reviews! I definitely don't recommend this video."
1,not good,"I thought we would get more images of space and the planets. All we got was a guy flapping his mouth all the time, he might as well been in a classroom. This was a very poor film."
3,I love the NIMH series.,I wish there were a few more books on the Rats of N.I.M.H. This book keeps the story going and surely someone could add to this lore.
1,"I'd hoped for something better than ""Racso""","This book was such a bitter dissapointment that I nearly didn't finish it, dispite the fact that I'd tried to find it for several years at one point. Any momentum left from the poorly characterized and poorly executed ""Racso"" was squashed flat in this story.What made the original so delicious to read was that there wasn't much involved in suspending disbelief. Mrs. Frisby and company felt like your friends, you sympathised with their plight and rooted for the the rats and the mouse family. In R-T, there's just nothing that brings the reader into the world and makes them become emotionally invested in the outcome. It's too forced and too silly to bother taking seriously.This was a lackluster end to what started as such a stellar series."
4,Best public book I know explaining how a CIA Case Officer Recruits & Handles Agents,"This memoir of a CIA Case Officer is excellent. You will learn how a CIA case officer targets, profiles and recruits agents. This is the heart of clandestine intelligence collection and it is the boots on the ground view.In addition to the insight gained in the initial recruitment phase and the psychological profiling that must be done by the officer, the book also describes the agent handling cycle - i.e. what is done once the agent or the relationship is no longer useful or for other reasons, the officer must terminate the relationship - and this termination must be handled in a delicate and sensitive manner.If one is interested in psychology, the CIA, intelligence, or foreign affairs, this is a great book and highly recommend it. The stories are cogent, detailed and fun to read."
2,Not so good...,"This book is a relatively boring account of a CIA agent's career. The author egotistical and conceited, and his description of the CIA is rather superficial. For the most part he does not delve into the intricacies of the nature of his assignments (this could be for security reasons)."
4,Very Interesting,"I found this book extremely informative, especially when it comes to Clarridge's part in the Iran Contra Affair. He also gives great insight into the workings of the CIA. He is very persuasive in his argument that America needs the CIA as badly now as it did during the Cold War."
2,This book struck me as rather dry.,This book seemed to be a very dry factual account with very few details of stories to liven things up a bit. I do not know what benefit one could get from reading this other than a brief accounting of how he spent his career.
2,Boilerplate for the National Security State,"To give a nonbiased review on this book is impossible, therefore I will let the author speak for himself in this following You Tube interview.[...]In a dream last night I channeled Tim McVeigh recommending this book to the White Aryan Nation, Klu Klux Klan, Westboro Babtist Church and Henry Kissinger's alter-ego.Caveat empeator!"
5,Very cool and great to get kids interested in physics,"Works like it says. We were able to keep the top up for about 4 hours until we had to take it down. Living in a small apartment has it's drawbacks. Great for an office and still mind boggling when ""observing"" the unseen forces at a later date. Don't get frustrated and be persistent until you get the perfect balance. It's well worth it!!"
2,"SAP Basis Certification Questions: SAP Basis Interview Questions, Answers, and Explanations",The book does not provided enough detail information as to how and what should be. Do not agree on certain answers given. If there are more than one way then other ways should be mention. For the price this book is not worthy. If you have SAP market place access most of the info is in OSS or help.sap.com.
1,Worst Book of the Millenium - Dont buy,"Hi Guys,Today i have received the book..I am totally disappointed with this book..its totally crap.you can find all these questions and bloody answers in internet in the below site....[...]the same is printed in the book..... no proper explanations.in some of the answers author mentioned to refer SMP or some book as if we cant search in google..... if that is the case why the hell did u write the book.. u -M----F-----R.....guys plz dont buy....KK"
5,"transaction codes, user security, and plenty of information","I find the 30+ pages of transaction codes, report names, and index to be extremely valuable. Good to have around even if you are working in SAP basis so that you can find what you need quickly without having to sort through all of yours notes."
4,FUN FUN,Kim Rae Won is a very good actor. but the rest are just not in his calibre. they should have used some one better to play the lead actress and the guy who plays her boss couldnt act at all. But still if you are Kim rae won's fan this is still a good show to watch. I think the best one so far is love story in harvard with kim tae hee ( stairway to heaven)who plays the lead roll opposite him.
3,Rooftop room cat,"This series got good reviews and thats the reason why i immediately bought this series to watch. Sadly, i was a little bit disappointed. i only give it 3 stars eventhough i enjoyed watching it, but after a while, it gets a lil bit boring. The storyline is just okay. Comedy wise its pretty hilarious but it lacks intensity of a good story.This is not bad to watch but it certainly not the best."
2,What was this??????,They could have kept this in their personal home video collection. The only thing I liked was the lead actor James Black. Everything else was worthless.
5,good video can u do better,this video shows what can be done with a little money and a lot of jr should be doing bigger films by now but being in the uk we are always the last to see or hear anything so if u know anything about jrs work let me know this video should be seen by just about anyone who likes sifi or horror and is well worth the money
4,"Creative, exciting low-budget horror","Originally released as 'Ozone,' this is a low-budget horror film that's loaded with gooey effects and is more inventive and off-beat than the box art and new title 'Street Zombies' might lead you to believe. A new street drug gradually transforms people into strange creatures and they develop into a sinister subculture. Above par special effects, particularly at the climax, good acting, and an unusual story add up to a way above average low budgeter."
3,Pleasantly thrilling and thrillingly unpleasant cheapie!,The direction is good and the acting is far superior to most low-budget movies...a pleasantly thrilling and thrillingly unpleasant cheapie from the prolific (and undeniably talented) J.R. Bookwalter...neat stuff!
1,TERRIBLE,"Terrible in every aspect of a movie. Do not buy this its not what you think, terrible effects, bad actors, dumb story, stupid characters, god what a bad movie im going to go break it in half right now."
4,Oh yeah Mr Simpatia!,"After twelve years of underground, Fabri Fibra signs wih Universal and shout ""shut up!"" to all the typical ""he sucks because he signed with a major"" haters. ""Tradimento"" is a good CD, really different if compared with other Fibra's albums like ""Turbe Giovanili"". What's bad? The strumentals. Italian producer Fish don't want to understand that there is more then club bangers...wack beats, where Fabri kills the scene spinning good rhymes and showing a great flow. Nesly Rice (his brother) produces other tracks, maybe the betters like ""Vaffan**lo scemo"".No doubt, Fibra is a good rapper, but, please! Leave Fish from the productions...."
4,Non Formal Reading Assessment,"This assessment is non formal, so do not use it in place of a formal diagnostic for reading. It is however able to be used from k-10 for literacy assessment. If your student reaches higher than a 10, well then he/she is most likely for pre-college reading."
5,Handy-dandy tote,Holds Champagne bottles too. Stores flat. Nice workmanship. Great for trips. XLT value.
4,Great Bag,This bag/cooler is perfect for on the go moms. I like to throw in a couple of cold water bottles on our way to the park or the mall. It keeps the water cool for along time.
4,Solid Product,"When I've used these testers they've always performed to my expectations. Some people with fancier ones try to down rate what I've bought, but the fact is they do what I bought them to do. That's all that matters to me and they work great."
2,amazon cloud player,"This is a great album, not including Clunk-Rewind-Clunk-Play-Clunk, but I didn't like how i had to download amazon cloud play just to download the songs on to my computer."
4,Hilariously funny!,"This is a really humorous novel. I read this book 10+ years ago, and I still remember how funny it was. Even though this book may be touted as a Young Adult book, I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys humorous adventure stories. I just repurchased this book recently, since I had loaned out my copy a long time ago, and it was never returned. I am looking forward to reading it again soon!"
3,A hurriedly put-together book to cash in on the frenzy.,"This book was the only book on Cunanan for a time. It reads like a hurriedly put-together book to cash in on the Cunanan frenzy created after the murder of Gianni Versace. I wondered how the author was able to get into Cunanan's head during his killing spree, and this tended to fictionalize the book. A more in-depth book on the Cunanan case is needed in order for the reader to get a better understanding of it."
2,Deliciously Awful,"This guy ought to be sued by The Washington Post for his word-for-word article rip-offs. You'd think he spoke with Cunanan via some channeler of the dead by the way he gives the intimate details of Andy's thoughts and motives. But I must say, it's chock full of delerioiusly scandalous rumors regurgitated as fact, nearly all of them undocumented, unnamed sources -- ""a close friend"" and ""a famous hollywood star."" This book has been a great source of inspiration for my own web site about Andrew -- but honestly, I couldn't even finish the whole thing, because it drags on worse than the 21-word title."
1,not a very believable book.,"I have read alot of true crime books, and this one was the most unbelievable. They way it was written - like the author knew what was going on in the mind of the killer - which is impossible (since he was by himself all the time after he killed those people.. I would not recommend this book."
5,Great Label and $8 Cheaper Here than at Office Depot,"This labeling tape is pretty good, and it is darn near impossible to screw it up: drop it into the label machine, type up your label(s), have it print, then peel off the backing and apply. I actually love these labels vs. what I have used in the past as it is truly a print, peel, and stick type of label with no mess and crisp, professional-looking fonts. This tape is also much better than the tape that originally came with the machine as this tape is much longer and will last for a lot more labels.To top everything else off as I type this review, I saved a little over $8 as the price I paid on Amazon was $16.80 vs. $24.99 for the same exact roll at the Office Depot down the street."
5,Address lables,I use this product to address envelopes. It works great and at a good price. I recommend this product for any one who handles mail.
4,Brevity is the soul of wrath,"I disagree with the NY Times--this book's covers are not too close together. It is of perfect length for a nice antisocial weekend. Kudos to King for introducing the reader to less obvious misanthropes. I learned that Diane Fossey was a savage, Ayn Rand was an obsessive-compulsive Fuhrer-in-waiting, and Ty Cobb was just a bully. People often confuse misanthropy with psychosis. King is sharp enough to make the distinction. I would bump into her and exchange vulgar insults anytime."
3,I was a little disappointed,"I like what she has to say about misanthropy, but I was expecting more shots at different types of people in general. Being a misanthrope, I can find many better reasons to not like people than some she has in this book. I was expecting a book that made fun of different stereotypes and discussed the variety of reasons to not like people in general.This promoted more stereotypes than it did dissecting them, though. The book was more of a political statement on what the author considers the ""feminization of America."" I can think of many things wrong in America, but fewer misogynists isn't one of them."
2,The title's the best part. Stop there.,"Someone once said that if you want to be popular with people, you should say what they already believe, and say it well.King is saying what I already believe, but the book is more empty handed than heavy handed, and most of the pages and chapters are filled with examples of the central idea or examples of people (King is, to be fair, elegantly perceptive.)The central idea could have been well presented in a mere three pages, so one presumes the rest is a misguided and ultimately failing attempt at entertainment value.When I encounter a book that fails to impress, I toss it in the library's bin and let them sell it or stock it.This book I chucked in the trash lest someone else be drawn in by the delightful title and allusions to Dorothy Parker-esque and waste their own time. Apparently, even I am not such a misanthrope to eschew that last act of charity."
2,Horrible movie,"I rented this film at a local BlockBuster Video store, and it was one of the most horrendous movies I've seen.The special effects were corny, the zombies weren't believable, and it had a weak plot.Overall, the movie stunk and isn't wasn't worth watching..."
1,Zombies rot and so does this movie...,I'm not a fan of Fulci but every once in a while in my search for something interesting I break down and watch one of his films. This movie is bad. It is a blatant knock-off of George Romero's movies and lacks everything that makes those movies worth watching. The effects make-up and gore look like they were done by a high school theatre troupe. The most offensive thing a movie can do is bore me. This one did just that. Save your time and money and rent something really scarey like Saving Private Ryan.
2,Item is only PACK of 1 not 4!!!,Ordered the product last weekend for my mother who simply adores it but was just told by supplier it doesnt come in a Pack of 4 but 1 pc. She will totally be disappointed. Product description is misleading. TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE!
2,Not for presentation.,"Not a great flag for presentation. The material is not a soft cotton, but rather a rough burlap-type material - not what I thought it would be. Very difficult to fold and didn't seem to be cut straight, which compounded the difficulty in folding."
3,No Fringe,I purchased this flag since it was the only 3x5 American Flag that appeared to come with a decorative fringe around the perimeter of the flag. It does not and the photo of this item should be changed to reflect that.
2,Faded Glory,Read the reviews and thought this flag would last. It had faded badly within a few months. I wouldn't buy it again. Perfect for flying it indoors. Who does that?
1,Not within specifications,The product delivered is not as pictured.The majority of the first row of stars is below the first white stripe. That is incorrect.The tag says it was made in the USA but I'd rather think it was not since it was so poorly produced.
5,made in the USA,"the nylon flags we've been getting, don't last very long, and sadly, were stamped with ""made in China."" This flag is made in the USA, of heavy cotton. I bring it in each night, and put it out each morning; I believe this will last for years longer than the China flags."
2,Good flag but not true to size,The flag is really nice quality. But I was looking to frame the flag in a 3' x 5' frame. The flag is several inches wider than 5' and an inch or two short of 3' high. I'm a little disappointed that the manufacturing could be this far off spec.
1,Abysmal,"I bought this flag from Amazon Deals for $7.42, which is about all it is worth, if even that. The quality is sub par. The cotton fabric is thinly woven and you can easily/clearly see through it, much like the quality of bedsheets you get at K-mart or Walmart. I assumed for the suggested retail price, that this flag would be at least 200 thread count. It is coated in a poly resin to give it mass and strength. Without the poly resin, it wouldn't even be thick/capable enough for being used as a dish rag.I was planning on putting this on the flag pole outside of my house, but I don't think it is worthy enough to take such stature.Sadly, this flag is ""Made in the USA"", probably by illegal immigrants. With quality such as this, no wonder the US has lost our standing in the world of manufacturing."
4,"Great flag, but is this normal...?","I have purchased 2 of these flags for my husband (USMC vet.) to fly in our front yard over the course of the last two years. The flag itself holds up well (does not tatter or shred), but the color seems to fade quickly. We fly our flag 24/7/365 with a light on it at night, taking it down when it rains or snows. For the third year in a row, I am needing to purchase another flag. Not because it is getting tattered, but because the colors are fading so badly (the red is now pink). I was hoping that getting a sturdy cotton flag would last longer than only a year, but the color fades so fast. Is this normal?I am going to try to buy a ""G-SPEC Cotton Flag-made to US Government Specifications"" directly from the Valley Forge Flag website in hopes the colors will last longer. It's more expensive, but if it lasts longer, it's worth it."
4,I GOTTA BE MOVIN' ON.,"This CD is a very good mix of one BUDDY GRECO album with TONY HATCH and another with ALF CLAUSEN. I love Buddy's versions of TOUCH ME IN THE MORNING, MOVIN'ON and HUNGRY YEARS. BUDDY seems to know very well, the meaning of the words he's singing. IT's MAGIC is coming from an album he recorded with his former wife JACKIE SABATINO. This album IS MAGIC. BUDDY GRECO seems to be always very hip.I push REPEAT on my CD player."
3,Warning!,"Black Coffee is not Black Coffee, it's Ain't Misbehavin. Somewhere along the way somebody messed up and transferred the wrong tune .... You can purchase Ray's original rendition of Black Coffee on itunes."
1,Impatient,Still waiting. Don't ask me for a review before I get my first issue. Check back in a couple months.
1,DO NOT PURCHASE,"I ignored other reviews and went ahead and ordered this subscription for my husband. Over a year later, we still haven't received one magazine. I should have raised the issue but just never did....SLAM magazine is pretty good, but don't purchase it this way, find another means."
2,I still didn't receive my order. It's taking forever.,"I ordered another magazin at the same time when I purchased slam. The other one came couple of weeks ago, but I still didn't receive slam."
1,Terrible,"This arrived all melted and coming out of the container. After mashing it back into a stick form, I tried it and it doesn't seem to get above ""warm."" Should be called cool and warm, not icy hot. Hands free application does have it's benefits, if the product works."
5,Excellent book on understanding End Times,"This is a ""must"" read for any serious student of Revelation. Fruchtenbaum's knowledge of both Old Testament scripture, New Testament gospel, of the Law and of the Prophets is unsurpassed. It is a perfect book for a class. I am not a preacher, but am able to grasp the materials. However, this is not a book to be read by a new believer. This material is meant for a mature Believer. If you ""highlight"" the strong points of a book, you will highlight three-fourths of The Footsteps of the Messiah."
5,Prophecy book,Filled w/ all the information you would ever want and more..Would highly recomend this book for studying Bible Prophecy..
4,Excellent book.,I am going through this book with some other ladies. One of the gals is writing study questions for our group. It is such a wonderful book for studying the end times. Every believer should read this book so that they would have eyes to see God's word more clearly.
4,understated elegance,"the voice of Ms Burton just took me to places I never expected to go, but was ready to experience. Joy,peace,and happiness abound when I listen to her and company sing about life and love in it's many forms."
3,a mixed bag,"You can have fun playing boggle on your computer, by yourself or with others, with this software.However, the creators could have done better. For example, they could have allowed you to save games so that you could compare your scores over time on the same set of characters to measure your improvement. And they could have given you the option to turn off the annoying sound that blares away when the game starts up."
5,Totally Addictive!,"I can't begin to tell you how often I play this game. I'll look up from the computer and two hours will have passed. I love Boggle and am pretty good at it, but it's hard to get my family members to play with me because I usually win. When playing on the computer, I can play against ""advanced"" players and they'll play whenever I want. (And I don't always win, so it's more challenging). Easy interface, great fun."
4,Great for newbies,"A great book if you're new to anthropology. Easy to read, and Jackson defines terms and theories well as he goes along."
2,Helluva writer...but work isn't that strong,"Let me say at the outset that the author is an excellent writer. I'm familiar with Dr. Jackson's work, and he is an excellent wordsmith.But in this case, his writing skills obscure the weakness of his argument.Jackson is arguing that for black people ""class"" isn't a matter of educational level, or a matter of income/wealth, but rather a matter of how one carries him/herself in different social settings. So class isn't something you ARE (as in, are you middle class or upper class) but something you HAVE (as in, are you ghetto acting or bourgie). Given the complex way politics and economics truncate black life options, this is a woefully inadequate way of grappling with race and class in Harlem, much less centers of black life like Detroit or Washington D.C.Again, VERY well written. It just isn't saying much."
1,Ships in 2 to ? MONTHS,"Ordered January 22. Still waiting. Amazon has been very pleasant. I suspect the book is on the verge of out of print since it is not available anywhere.So, expect long wait if you order."
1,Run Away!,"Please go buy another product. If you want to do iron-on transfers, there are MUCH better options than this one. First complaint: the ""clear"" portion of the iron-on quickly turns a shade of ""cream"" the moment you finish ironing it in place. Second: it looks and feels like you have ironed a place-mat to the shirt, which then quickly wrinkles, fades, and peels off, even after just the first wash. Third: the iron-on does not stretch with the shirt behind it: it cracks! If you purchase or use this item, I guarantee you disappointment. I have tried it three miserable times, and would never in this lifetime use it again on anything I intended to wear or give as a gift. I am throwing away my remaining sheets."
2,Where should I do this?,"Only after opening the package was I able to read that I have to do this on a hard, smooth, heat-resistant surface. These instructions, of which there is no hint on the outside of the package, state that I cannot use an ironing board, glass, granite, concrete, heat sensitive or heat-sink surfaces. They specifically recommend formica, but I don't have any!Also, nothing here says I can use a 100% cotton t-shirt, but I couldn't find white cotton/poly blends.And this doesn't apply to me, but they do not put this on the package and I think it's pretty important. This paper will not work in HP Deskjet 1200C and 1600C printers because they apply heat.I understand simplicity of package design, but they are missing some critical info. It dupes people into buying what they cannot use. But then, maybe that's the point."
4,Easy to use t-shirt transfers,"This transfers are certainly easy to use although a certain attention to detail is recommended. My Canon MP610 has a print mode for transfers and that has to be selected to get a good print. The iron should be on maximum heat and the steam shut off during the transfer process. That process works easy enough, and the results are certainly presentable. My print bleed a little bit after the first wash but was still acceptable. Before buying this product, I would suggest to print out the picture on a regular page, cut it out and place it against the t-shirt. 8"" 11"" is relatively small on an adult chest! All things being equal, a good product for quick, funny t-shirt creation. I am not sure if I were to go professional with it, though."
3,Standard quality,"This transfer sheet is an ok item - the fabric will feel plastic-y after application of the transfer, so if that will bother you, or if it will be worn by someone with sensitivities, look for something else. Otherwise, this transfer sheet will enable you to create unique apparel. It's also useful for art applications, such as quilting or wearable art (think purses, accessories). There are ways around the plastic-ness, you just have to use some creativity. But then,that's what this kind of product is all about!"
4,"great product, easy to use!","This was a very simple product to use, even for those like me that haven't picked up a clothes iron in over two years (took me twenty minutes to even find it).No paper jams on the print out, the ink did not smear, and after ironing on the transfer the paper peeled off and the product looked great. Whole process took less than ten minutes. Follow the directions and there will be no problems. Washed the shirt already, and the transfer still looks great.Easy to use, works as advertised."
1,just didn't work for me,I've tried using this product twice now and I had trouble getting the release paper off and made a big mess. The small size like this apparently came with the wrong instructions but the instructions with this larger size wasn't a whole lot better. I had no luck with it maybe it's my iron but I'm giving up trying maybe you will have better luck then me.
3,Seems to work...but for how long,"I was pretty skeptical about how this would work. I thought it would come off right away, but I was wrong. It has gone through the washer a time or two and it is still there. I'm just not sure how many washes these can handle.Anyway, you will want to make sure you have something good and hard to press the image onto your shirts. I used a large cutting board. Make sure you have the iron on the hottest setting and use even motion.Even though this works, it makes the t-shirt uncomfortable because it is pretty stiff. I have a couple of sheets left and I think I'll try them on something other than a t-shirt and see how that works.Overall, it is OK, but don't expect it to be perfect and I doubt it will last a long time."
1,Terrible Product! Buy something else!!,"I don't usually do product reviews but was so angered by this product that I just had to write something. I ended up ruining 3 items that i was trying to iron some words onto because once i ironed the printed sheet onto the fabric, I couldn't peel it off!! It reminded me of when i try to take off a price tag but half of it ends up sticking to the item and then you have to get ""goo-gone"" to get it off. So I had to get a wet washcloth and scrub off the backing which revealed the letters I wanted to show but then it had a white halo around the words... ugh - it was horrible. My cloth envelopes I was trying to label look horrible, at the very best. I am still trying to find a way to salvage them.I am not sure what i will buy now but to be sure i will not be using this again!!"
1,Horrible Product!!!,"Do your homework, read reviews before buying T-shirt transfers and find some that work. The Avery brand transfers do not work. It took almost two of these packs just to get two shirts out of and even those two were very bad looking. These are a total waste of money! I would have given it zero stars if that were possible."
1,No good at all.,This product is no good. Did not transfer at all. The one for dark fabric is rotten also. Don't waste your money on it. These should not be on the market!! A total waste.
4,Worked well,"I realized I wanted to make a custom onesie for my son to wear at an engagement party. Sadly, I only came up with this idea 2 days before the party and it was too late to order one from a custom t-shirt website. I bought this hoping that the results would be acceptable. I made 4 onesies with 1 sheet of paper (cut it up in 4) and the results were very good. One of the designs I did ended up running a little in the wash. I'm not sure if this was because I didn't iron that one on long enough, or if it had to do with the design. 2 of the onesies came out really well though, looked like I had ordered them custom. Overall I was very pleased. And cost wise, this was much, much cheaper than ordering from a company and I was able to make the design exactly the way I wanted.One important tip, if your design includes words, remember to print it out mirror image!"
3,chasing the ghost,"Collide has two things going for them right now. First, a killer album cover. Second, a pretty decent singer. The music is alright (if you can call a bunch of programmed beats and noises music) but is clouded over by an annoying fuzzy noise. Collide are trying to be like Faith and the Muse (who actually play instruments to go along with their programmed things), but aren't cutting it very well. If you're into the more recent definition of ""gothic"" music, you'll probably enjoy this while painting your faces white and black and mutilating yourselves while thinking about how terrible your suburban middle-class lives are, but if you like hearing instuments clearly and like a little variety in your musical listenings, give Faith and the Muse a listen. They're more varied in their style, Monica Richards is a much better singer, they play instruments, and they tend to have a brighter outlook on life!"
3,CURVE-ball,"After reading the other reviews I had to rush out and download some songs (actually the whole ""Ghost"" album). What struck me right off was the fact that nobody mentioned CURVE in their reviews. Collide seems to tread some line between Curve and Delerium, Balligomingo, et cetera. They have less guitars than Curve, the music is not as fleshed out, and the atmosphere is far less dark. That would be fine if the songs were as strong, but they aren't, at least not on this album.Overall, the album is not bad. If you are a fan of this type of music you will undoubtedly find something worthwhile here. However, if you have not heard of CURVE, then redirect yourself and check out ""Come Clean"" or ""Cuckoo"" first."
5,Great music!,"Collide is an excellent band! The female vocalist has a lovely voice and a good range. The lyrics are cool, rather dark overall I'd say, but still great, esp. when you're in a darker mood. Awesome band in general...Seductive, somewhat sinister, original, and good tunes!!!"
3,OKAY BUT NOT STELLAR,"I like songs 1, 2, 7 and the band's dance remake of White Rabbit. kaRin's voice is hauntingly similar to Kate Bush; although real heavy on the Vo-Coder. Some of the songs, instead of being entrancing tend to drone on and none of the tracks pop out as a really strong single. However, I am not sorry I bought the cd and would recommend it to others because it's easy on the ears (very melodic)."
5,What depeche mode might have been with female vocals,"I discovered this band by accident but I love this album in particular. The dark and moody atmosphere of the music and sensual singing really come together on this album. I am a big fan of the Depeche Mode album SONGS OF FAITH AND DEVOTION and although very different I think if you like that you will like this. Mode has a lot more up tempo songs and the mode stuff is harder but its the tech stuff and the feel that are similar.I also like a lot of bands with the same mood but a little harder, The Gathering, Lacuna Coil, Anti-m, Xymox, Evanescence, Within Temptation are all bands I like, Xymox being more electronic than the others. Of course music is subjective so what I like you might not.Chasing the Ghost is in my most played ipod playlists as well as in my car and my home stereo."
3,Good stuff.,"So I had heard a few Collide songs (namely, their cover of White Rabbit) and was completely blown away with the dynamics of the band. Now not to say this album is terrible, but a lot of the songs sound similar with similiar tempos and beats its hard to distinguish one from another. If all songs had the same sort of sound and feeling as White Rabbit, I would have rated this CD higher. I think the band has a lot of talent, they just need to put it to good use. Its a good CD over all, but I think with just a little help in the music department this band can really take off!"
5,Wonderful Cd!!! I can't believe I hated it at first!,"This has to be Collide's best cd! At first I was turned off by her voice; but once you listen to it more, it blends with the music. You have to be in a certain mood at times, but the music grabs you and puts you in a mystical trance. I'm glad I gave it another chance!"
3,A truly Great sitcom crashes down to Average,"Newsradio's fifth season is a very different beast from the four years of comedic gold that preceded it. Shattered to the core by the untimely death of Phil Hartman, it isn't until near the end of the season that the well-oiled comedy machine that was Newsradio's original cast recovers. Unfortunately by this time, the scripts themselves were showing signs of fatigue, and the show as a whole had quite frankly lost its touch. Despite intermittently great episodes, like ""Apartment"", ""Freaky Friday"" and ""Padded Suit"", the fifth season disappoints more often than not and can really only be recommended to the fans."
5,Outstanding Collection - Even withouth Phil Hartman,"While I was worried that this final season would suffer due to the unfortunate lack of Phil Hartman, I can honestly say I have enjoyed these episodes. This series has always been good for a laugh and the 5th season is no exception. I would highly recommend this collection for any News Radio fan!"
4,Good show. Last season is better than I expected.,I expected that this last season wouldn't be as good as the others but I was pleasantly surprised. We have enjoyed it and like that we can finish the series.
5,"Not the best season, but still great","Despite the tragedy of Phil Hartman's death, the 5th and final season of NewsRadio is still very good. Max Louis (Jon Lovitz) is not a great addition to the show, but he has his moments and decent chemistry with the rest of the cast. ""Flowers for Matthew,"" the episode with ""Smatthew"" (Smart Matthew) is one of my all-time favorites and worth the price of admission alone. A must have for any NewsRadio fan."
3,An interesting tale of of a total novice,"First, this is NOT a training book. There are many such books around which are far better for that purpose. It is, rather, the short story of a total novice who gets the totally wrong dog for himself, a big-running field trial-bred Pointer to hunt grouse in the Northeast. Fortunately, he gets steered to some good professional trainers and after at least three long stays with them for his dog, gets things mostly worked out.It is an interesting book, but the training is not done by the author; moreover, he has no knowledge of what he's done wrong, either in training or initial selection of his dog, so can't make suggestions to others. It isn't at all impossible to train a bird dog yourself, but you have to do your homework and be more sensible than Healy. Well-written and worthwhile book, though, if you don't expect too much. 3 1/2 stars maybe, especially if you are WAY over your head and want to use a pro trainer. But NOT a training book."
3,Maybe it's just me...,"Well... i dunno about the rest of the living, but i didn't really enjoy this one. Maybe it's because it is almost EXACTLY like SSX tricky on 2 wheels. I rented Superfly and this. I loved Superfly, but i felt i like was play a rehash of Tricky with this thing. Try both and see what you like BEFORE you bust out with the Visa."
4,Underrated! This game will test the best of the best!,"Here's the deal, many of the reviewers say this is like playing SSX tricky on wheels! Well, with all due respect, its not! Freelstyle is far more challenging that SSX tricky as far as races go and believe me, I love SSX tricky! Plus, unlocking new tracks, bikes and riders will really test your skills. As far as the tracks themselves go, the earlier ones are short, but very tough and when u fall off your bike, there is none of that SSX tricky re-start method; here, you have to go back a few feet!! So, for the 20 dollars you will pay for this game, you will feel that you added a great new game to your collection that will challenge the most experienced gamer and greatly improve the mediocre among you! Go get it, its worth every dollar (not more than 20 though!! lol!)"
4,Good Price - Great Game !@,Product came as described good deal and very fun game. Over-all Good shopping experience - would use again and Recommend - Yes. 4 - Stars.
5,Very good calculator,"I really like this calculator because of its size and how easy it is to punch the buttons. Maybe my age is showing. For me, the paper print out is not necessary but there is a way to turn it off. Some other reviews stated an adapter doesn't come with this calculator but mine came with one, an extra bonus. I highly recommend this calculator to anyone sick of those little tiny ones and anyone sick of solar powered ones that don't seem to have enough light to work most of the time."
4,Good things do come in small packages,"Someone had said thier calculator did not come with the adapter. I ordered it anyway. It did come with the adapter. The price was excellent and I wasn't expecting much. I am very pleased with this and feel I got a great deal. The key pad is big enough so you actually hit the number you want. It is small and compact perfect for areas you don't want cluttered. I was concerned what paper roll size it would hold, but if you want to use the small roll for small projects, it rests in the area. However, if you want to use the large roll there is a metal arm that comes up to hold a bigger roll. It is so easy to go from printing to just using the adding machine without tape in one push of a button. The printing is clear, easy to read and not too small of print. It has multi functions and easy to use. I don't know how long the printing ribbon lasts or if it is easy or not to change it. Looks very small, but I didn't try removing and replacing it."
1,Not what accountants are looking for,"When I bought this, I was searching for was a portable adding machine with tape to do taxes on the go. This is not it. The item does feature what it calls 'add mode' but the only thing this mode does is the fix the decimal at 2 places. It does NOT emulate the proper keystroke sequence of an adding machine. If you are doing adding machine style data entry, the final result on the display may be right, but the tape will show the wrong result every time. If you want the tape to be correct, you have to use calculator style entry order. Is it honestly that hard to scale down an adding machine? Not a single accountant at Sharp even tried this product before it went out the door. The keypad action is decent enough, considering the size. It does have the annoying tendency to occasionally and spontaneously issue keystrokes when moved. If you are doing a long calculation, or running a tape, don't move it until you get your final result."
5,Tebaldi better Tosca than Callas,"There you go again, Callas fans still attacking Tebaldi. I think Tebaldi is a better Tosca than Callas. But you dont have to say Callas is that much better than than Tebaldi, who had a glowing soprano."
3,Bad sound; go for Callas or Milanov,"This recording has bad sound, but the performances on it are white hot. My advice is to go with Callas' 1953 studio ""Tosca"" in decent mono sound or Milanov's 1957 live Covent Garden ""Tosca"" in decent sound. The Milanov recording is on Opera d'Oro and has a small amount of tape hiss, but the sound is quite good, certainly better than this recording. Milanov's Tosca, like Tebaldi's, is matronly, but unlike Tebaldi's, her Tosca lacks Mediterranean warmth. Still, she is an involved Tosca and that live recording shows her off to much better effect than her studio recording does. Her high notes in the Torture Scene must be praised. They are sung forte and are very secure. The ""Io quella lama"" high C, however, is less successful.In summary, this recording of ""Tosca"" has bad sound, but Tebaldi, di Stefano, and Gobbi shine through the bad sound with their wonderful performances."
5,One of the best companion for the Lewis' fiction.,"Howard is an original and faithful lewisian teacher. One can see things up to now undiscovered and enjoy again Narnia, the Ransom's books and Till We Have Faces."
1,these lights are horrible.,"These lights were very nice looking, easy to assemble, looked nice in my garden. The problem is the lights do not work and have never worked well. not all the lights work at the same time and they only last an hour or so. These were a complete waste of money."
2,Difficult to use even with practice,"My fine motor skills & visual acuity are intact but it took lots of practice to get the labels on correctly using a slim dvd case. Even then the labels sometimes don't go on easily depending on how successful you are at separating the label from the backing sheet. The print quality & label quality are OK. To add to my frustration, the link on the product container gives an expired URL for downloading templates. I couldn't get the Avery Design Pro for Mac software to download correctly & the process froze my browser. Avery's apparently using a text file, not an executable for its download. In conclusion, a nightmare of an expensive product."
5,Works perfectly and easily,I have had no problems with this - installs right away and consistently gets reception.
1,Driver software does not work,"The software that comes with this card does not work. You have to download the software that works from their website. Lesson learned, always check for new drivers before installing any hardware."
5,Beautiful writing,"Interestingly, the first few and last few stories in this collection are not enjoyable or interesting.The majority of the collection however, is filled with amazing tales and beautiful prose. In sometimes only 7 pages, Berriault creates characters that seem so real. The stories typically don't climax or resolve, but they leave you thinking about their implications."
2,Women in their Beds Who Can't Get Up,"Perhaps, as someone who does want to escape when they open up a book and start to turn the pages, this book was the wrong selection. Ms. Berriault certainly crafts unwavering depictions of alienation, isolation and banality without apology as her characters remain insulated from feeling - much the way inpatients in a local asylum bounce off padded walls as their next injection of lithium is delivered. The Greeks, I'm told, wrote comedy as a form of entertainment for the masses. Tragedy was written to bring about catharsis and nowhere in these pages was that release to be found."
3,not stories but episodes,"Yes, Berriault is a skilled writer who can create diverse and believable characters and situations. But as the previous reviewer said, if you read the whole book within a short time it's just too depressing!I also felt obscurely dissatisfied with each individual story. I think it's because they aren't really stories -- they are episodes, or descriptions of situations, with little development and no 'closure'. To a devotee of Alice Munro, who packs a novel's worth of material into a short story, this just isn't enough!"
1,Award winner? Go figure...,"Gina Berriault can certainly grind prose with the best of them. Unfortunately, she's neglected the other parts of that equation which makes a story compelling...characters, tension, and plot. Her characters' distance from the reader render sympathy difficult, if not impossible. After each story I was left with the feeling, ""Who cares?"" I certainly didn't.In other words...excellent technique, but absolutely nothing to say.I'm astounded that this book won several awards - how it managed to do so is a mystery to me. Sounds like a PR ploy, doesn't it?I strongly recommend that anyone interested in purchasing this book read a couple of the stories first before plunking down hard-earned cash."
5,walkin,"WOW! this is one of his best works,a mix of jazz fusion and rock. a must have!If you like Carlos Santana you'll LOVE (WALKIN) by Masayoshi Takanaka."
1,Horrible,"I'm afraid I can't review the concert itself. The sound was so bad, I couldn't sit thru the first 10 minutes. Worst sound recording I've ever heard, and I've heard a lot of bad recordings."
3,If you have never had a violin before...,"I am sure this is a fine product. I just wanted to comment more on the person who reviewed the product before me. If you have never had a violin, viola, cello, or bass before then of course the bow wouldn't make the strings have sound. Its called putting rosin on the bow. Do yourself a favor and research just a little on how these stringed instruments are played, tuned, and maintained before you jump to conclusions that this is a bad product. Maybe it's possible that your uneducated mind can not comprehend virtuosos such as Itzhak Perlman, Niccolo Paganini, Iwao Furusawa, Rachel Barton, Anastasia Khitruk, just to name a few. The main point is to do research on products before you by them so you know what you are doing when you receive the item. Thanks."
1,great as a toy,"If you are looking for a detailed toy this is great, however as an instrument it does not come with a bow that will produce sound from the strings, nor does it stay in tune."
2,Old product,"I was disappointed when I received the labels. The labels came individually - a square, 1/4 of a full sheet of the paper, so you really had to manipulate them into the printer. The labels came bent with yellow edges, as if it was sitting a shelf for years. Although it says you can use with STOMP, they never specified that you needed a specific version of the software. I had to call the company to get this info. The version upgrade was free, but a hassle."
2,Can you say junk?,"This machine has been VERY disappointing. When it runs, it's fine. It just doesn't run very often. Machine has been to HP for repair 3 times in the first 10 months I have owned it. Overheats and turns itself off, screen will go black if it is moved, mouse constantly freezes and locks and machine has to be rebooted. I've raised enough stink with HP they are replacing it with a higher end model a ZV. If you buy this machine due to it's attractive price, buy an extended warranty and be prepared to be without it often."
3,"At 900, not really a value notebook","I tried this notebook at Circuit City, it is very fast at running Office applications, noticeably faster than my P4 2.4GHz Inspiron 8500. The unit looked good, and was light enough. The screen was ok but did not shine really, it would only be sharp when looking at a 90 degree angle.However, given that you need to add another 256MB of RAM and a wireless card, the current price does not make it a good value.P.S. The Amazon description is totally off, it corresponds to another system (probably the ze4420)."
4,NICE LAPTOP,"I bought mine at Circuit City for 700 and I absolutely love mine. Had no problems with it so far. It is a little big compared to the ibook i used to have, but overall its a great computer. The 1.8ghz is fast enough and the computer does have a kind of velocity engine to speed up your applications so it is just as fast as a p4 compatible. Overall great laptop. Good for college students, not for really serious users. Not good for games either."
1,waste of money,"Bad video, bad music, bad over all. I thought I was buying a movie but this is some kind of beyond low budget homemade documentary."
1,Save your money,"not a very good video, not well done, somewhat interesting,they track the lives of several immigrants coming to the US"
4,SEXY COWBOY,"I really enjoyed this book! Fate brings about a chance meeting between Harden & Miranda, and the opportunity for 2 sad people to make each other happy - in the usual sexy Diana Palmer style. Well worth reading, as is ""Evan"" and ""Connal"", Harden's brothers' stories."
5,Diana Palmer Knows her western,Diana Palmer is one of the best western authors that I know. I love all of her books. This was a very good book!!
2,Hardly worth your time,"The story of Harden was an o.k. story, but I felt it started too abruptly and unrealistically. It never really fleshed out Harden or the romance between the two main characters. Miranda said she was normally a strong and independent person, but that was never shown in the book. I prefer my heroines with a little spine, they don't have to be the strongest, but it's nice for them not to be so weak. She was too naive, especially for being married before, even if it wasn't an ideal marriage. I know this book were written 14 years ago and the time was a little different from now, but it was far from the best Diana Palmer I've ever read. I'd say get it at the library first and then see if you'd want to own it.2.5/5"
4,Great Product,"Extremely fast shipping, and product was packaged perfectly. Would definitely do business with again."
5,Great way to build your spanish vocabulary,"This is an excellent way to learn new Spanish words. It is much more effective than memorizing the words listed in a book. It really helps improve your comprehension of the spoken language. However, be prepared to listen to the tapes over and over again."
5,I THINK THE SONG IS CALLED LAY YO BODY DOWN OR YOUR BODY.,"I REALLY LIKE THIS GROUP VERY MUCH AND I HOPE ONE DAY THEY CAN COM TO MEMPHIS,TN. I'VE NEVER SAW ANY OF THEM BUT I HEARD THEM ON A CD AND AT ALL THE LOCAL CLUBS DOWN HERE.KANDICE,,MEMPHIS,TN"
3,"Editing, editing, editing.","The content of this book is fine, if not earth-shattering. However I can't overlook the poor proofreading of the copy. When I see 2 spelling mistakes within a few pages and missing punctuation, it turns me off the entire work, no matter who wrote it."
1,Deceptive Advertising,"This poorly edited and abysmally proofread book is nothing more than a compilation of unrelated articles on obscure elements of the history of one Shia sect. There is no unifying theme, and the book fails utterly to live up to its promise. I bought it after being impressed by interview with the author on NPR's ""Fresh Air"" program. Clearly the interviewer made the running."
5,Cant wait for her next story,Please hurry Wendy. I cant wait to hear more about the Grayson lives. This is the most compelling series i have read in quite a while
4,Good book in a good series,This was a good book in an interesting series. The setting is unique which added something to the typical romance story.
3,Balloon wouldn't hold helium.,"Cute, large balloon, but before we left the grocery with it, it was losing air. They didn't even charge us for it since it was poor quality and wouldn't stay inflated long. If your child is too young to notice it not staying blown up, than this will be fine for your party. Thankfully, my 2 year old daughter didn't notice it 'dying' as I did."
3,"Cute but doesn't last, must've got a lemon!","Bought this for my son's 3rd birthday party, had the balloon filled at the local supermarket. By the time I got home, the balloon was sagging. I returned to the store and they refilled the balloon at no charge, thinking she didn't fasten it off, but after a thrid try, the lady at the store said it was the balloon that wouldn't hold helium. She had the exact same balloons at her shop and could sell me another already filled for 7.99. Considering I had to pay 5.00 for the helium, I would've been better off buying it direct from her! She said normally these balloons, left unmolested could float for months.I contacted seller and they never replied. Ended up blowing it up with regular ambient air from our lungs and a straw every few moments for the party and just stuck it to the wall with tape."
5,Thomas Balloon,"This was for my grandson's 3rd birthday. He was very surprised & he loved it! Very strong, held up well. Our local Glen's store filled it with helium for $1. Very happy with this!"
4,cookware review,"Merchandise arrived fairly promptly. Box looked a little old. I wondered if it was a returned item. As far as I know , it performs as expected."
4,Japan,"This is better than the first JPop/Rock history CD. On it, many track names are in japanese (and me, not knowing much japanese has a hard time reading it) but tracks 7,9 and 10 are awesome. If you like this one, I would suggest getting the first JPop/Rock history CD too, as one of my fave songs, Showishima is on it(Show me)"
4,Good Surfing Tunes!,"If you listen to this CD on its own merits, without comparing to the other PEBBLES volumes, you will find this is a great collection of Surf tunes. Original cracks and pops from the 45s left in for that crazy beach 45 player ambience. If this is your thing, try Ace Records BEACH PARTY reissue also. COWABUNGA!"
2,Sand Pebbles,"I don't have any other of the Pebbles compilation CD's so there will be no comparison done in this regard. This is a somewhat hoaky collection of Surf tunes with a few excellent tracks---especially ""Flashin' Red"" by the Esquires---a must have song for the avid Surf Instrumental fan. This is predominantly vocal and not overly exciting, but has good liner notes and I suppose avid Surf fans will not be too disappointed. There's certainly better compilations to be had."
3,Slower than my Lexar 1GB Sport Drive,I expected the same speed as my current 1GB drive. Its about 50% slower. I will be returning it for another 1 GB Lexar Sport Drive
2,Lexar 2 gb Jump Drive Sport,"I have had a 256 mb, 512 mb, and a 1 gb Jump Drive Sport. I love these sturdy and reliable drives. I was very dissapointed when I first used the 2 gb model. The data transfer rate seems to be extremely slow. Its slow even when saving a plain text document! I would buy again only if they improve the speed of this drive."
1,If I could rate it 0 stars I would,"I got excited when I first saw this book. The age group seemed great, 14 -22. I wanted something that I could use in college and this appeared perfect. Well I was very much disappointed. The monologues are boring and corny; and not even corny enough to be funny, just bad. This might be good for a drama class taught by a teacher who finds everything art and expression, but if you are looking for audtion monologues or a performance monologue-look somewhere else. I have made a list of good acting books, and this certainly doesn't make it. The pieces in here are unrealistic, and even the best actor could not make them entertaining. Most show little emotion and are very bland. The others that do show emotion, show only one and are never complex. The intros to the monologues are never near enough for you to understand what would provoke these speeches. If you need paper to line your birdcage, by all means by this book otherwise, don't waste your time or money"
2,Funny but poor audio quality,"We loved this in highschool- it really is designed for kids and stoned adults. But the audio quality is very poor, hard to make out what is being said. It may have been a problem with the original mics, or when it was transferred from vinyl to CD."
3,"A good book, but doesn't always apply...","I liked the suggestions in this book; however, many of the arguments AGAINST a topic called 'environmental education' in this book are actually based on a specific program in Britain that the authors are referring to. At first I did not realize this, and I thought that the authors were suggesting that environmental education was a bad idea. It was a bit confusing. Beyond that, it definitely has some interesting and helpful ideas if you are an educator."
4,A Fascinating Listening Experience,"What I expected to hear when I received this CD was something like an Enya recording: fun at first hearing but soon to wear out its welcome. Instead, what I heard was a rich, deep, and rewarding recording both musically and sonically. Singer Nóirín Ní Riain is accompanied on many of the cuts by the Paul Winter Consort, the result being a complex blend of instruments with a warm overall sonority that is undergirded in places by bass frequencies that really plumb the depths. The songs are an interesting mix of Celtic and Oriental, with texts and notes provided. In all, listening to this CD is a fascinating experience, and I recommend it quite highly."
2,"Good, but out of date.","Jeff does a great job describing Uniface Six, even to the layperson. Indeed even a seasoned Uniface Professional such as myself learned much about the product.Yet, the book is now hopelessly out of date for Uniface Seven and beyond. Still, if you are interested in the history of Uniface functionality, this is worth a read.In its time, this book was five stars."
1,Sharp UX-22BC Ink Cartridge,"I purchased a Sharp UX-22BC Ink Cartridge from this seller, and the ink cartridge was EMPTY. At first the seller was very good about contacting me about the return and that process went very well! THEN...I did not get any instructions as to if she was sending me out a new cartridge or was going to refund my money. I e-mailed this seller serveral times in a months time and got no response!! It was not until I e-mailed Amazon that I finally did get a refund to my account! I would not ever order from this seller again, as a matter of fact, it scares me to even want to order anything again online. Times are tough for all of us, right now, and $45.00 is alot of money. This is not the time to play around with a persons $$$$.Darrel Miller"
3,Alright....,Postive: Quick deliveryNegative: The shuttles were surprisingly brittle and didn't even last a few points. Had to use up three-four shuttles for one 15 point game.
1,Waste of time and money,"It seems that authors of the book didn't put enough time reviewing sample code in the book, it is written in weird style with tons of errors. Code is non-readible, writing style is the worst I've seen, they try to imitate C-style coding and just couldn't do it,code infested with missing parethesis, brackets, misplaced keywords, etc... Bottom line, buy Ivor Horton's book on Java instead!"
2,Not a book designed to learn Visual J++,"I bought this book with the ancipation of learning Visual J++. Although the book contains large amounts of code, which I liked, there are virtually no explanations. I wanted not only to see the code but see an explanation of what is occuring with each statement. Entire functions and classes are presented with explanations like ""creates images"" or ""gets graphics"". How? Why? If all you want is to learn by example, this book will do it for you. If you want explanations of the code, then look somewhere else. Perhaps this is the way the authors intended it, but I was greatly dissapointed."
4,"quiet, beautiful, many moods","This disc is principally harp and flute playing the artists' own compositions. It features a variety of moods, which I find by turns entertaining and frustrating depending on what I'm doing when I listen. There's a new agey spacey piece, middle-eastern and oriental influences, celtic stuff, kinda what you'd expect. It's all well played and well recorded. I bought this disc directly from David Michael, who was playing solo harp for anybody who wanted to listen on a ferryboat crossing Puget Sound one day. I liked it well enough to find myself on Amazon checking to see if there was more."
2,"Massenet: Manon / Maag, Pavarotti, Freni, Panerai, et al","Grabación en directo. Aunque el precio es barato, es una pena que la calidad del disco y la ausencia de libreto nos oblige a puntuarlo bajo.Intérpretes buenos, pero escasa calidad de sonido"
4,Manon Italian Style,"Though I am undoubtedly a fan of this opera, I will be the first to admit that it is clearly flawed. For all its beautiful music, there is no denying the fact that the opera is, at times, tedious, sluggish, and, well, French. Those who are fans of the pure, lyrical stylings of say Beverly Sills and Alfredo Kraus in this opera should definitely avoid this. But those who want some new life breathed into this opera, well, look no further.THe young Pavarotti & Freni sing this as if they were singing Puccini's Manon treatment. It's arduous, passionate, sexy and extremely Italian. Never has either of them sung with such intense, unbridled passion.For this reason, this recording is a must. For those looking for some fine Massenet, well, try another recording of this opera, or just another opera all together (i.e. Herodiade)."
4,excellent,"I first heard this recording on a radio broadcast in NY in 1981 and I recorded it on cassette at that time. Unfortunately I had company at my house so I missed some critical moments. However, they were both in excellent voice and it is worth buying. There is a great CD of this opera from a live Paris recording with Renee Fleming and Marcello Alvarez. While Alvarez is not on the level of Pavarotti, he is quite good in this. Fleming is outstanding. This is probably the best French recording of this opera and I think it surpasses the Sills recording."
1,The sad story of a troublemaker,"This is nothing more than a badly written story by a troublemaker.Furlong was asked, at his ordination, if he believed Jesus is the Son of God and he answered ""yes"" - however the book makes clear that that answer was a lie - even at his ordination Furlong know he didn't believe that Jesus was the Son of God.Then, to soothe his conscience for having betrayed his own beliefs (by making the ordination vows), he started teaching contrary to the creeds of the church that was employing him. Rather than step down and accept that he didn't believe in the Christian religion, he tried to remain a Christian priest and continue to receive a salary.It is Furlong who is a hypocrite - I'd far rather read something by Prof Richard Dawkins, who is always honest about his beliefs (and has never suggested that the Church should pay him a salary to attack it!)"
1,Awful Ranting,The author is a heretic God-hater trying to get sympathy for speaking out against God. We already have a concise enough example of this in Scripture with Judas committing suicide to get people to feel sorry for him. We don't need an entire book of blathering on the subject.
5,Good stuff!,"Yeah, its soap and it works great. It has no smell which is weird. It lathers up fine and does a good job cleaning off grime and grease (I work in maintenance at a filthy shop). It doesn't seem to leave a residue on my skin. I will have to buy some more. The bar size is 1/2 the size of a Zest bar but it doesn't disappear as fast."
1,THIS PRODUCT IS NOT FOR DVD's - Amazon has wrong number,"Like another reviewer, I received CD Labels NOT the DVD Labels that were pictured. I called Avery and they confirmed that the product number (8692) is only for paper CD Labels, and that DVD labels are sold under product number (8962). I am returning these because Avery advised that the CD labels will not stand up to the additional heat generated by DVD players.I have rated this one star, because I have no need for CD labels. The rating is for Amazon's internet display which is misleading, not the product which I assume works well as a CD label. If that is what you are looking for, it may be fine for that limited use.I hope that this review will spare others the inconvenience of having to return the item."
1,Hard to apply - Sent different product,"The package I received says ""Matte White CD Labels"" and not ""Matte White CD/DVD Labels."" Not sure if this makes a difference, but I figured that it didn't. The labels fit DVDs, however the quality is inferior to the first set of labels that I purchased. My main complaint is that the labels have a slight bend when you remove the backing. This makes it difficult to apply the label to the DVD (I use the applicator), and I destroyed several labels and DVDs before figuring out a method to have it apply correctly. The very first set of labels that I bought from Avery peeled ""flat,"" and it was a breeze to apply. Not the case for this set."
4,No applicator required,I like these Avery labels as they are designed not to require an applicator. The color reproduction is very true but remember to let the labels totally dry so the ink does not smear while you are putting them onto the cds. I just leave mine in the printer until later and it works fine. I have used other brands but always seem to return to Avery.
4,Worked Great! No Issues,"I purchased two packs of these to label a large family home movie DVD project I was working on. It was very easy to find the template in Microsoft Word and print out onto the labels. I did not have any that got stuck in my printer, and none of the ink smeared. They are also thick enough so that if you have a majority of the label white the labels/writing on the CD/DVD underneath do not show through."
4,"Very good barrel, increases accuracy","This barrel is great if you want to increase the accuracy of your marker, but tends to be unconfortable in tight spaces due to it's lenght, it also gets picky with cheap paintballs but that is rather a pro than a con."
5,uniforms in detail,A must have for any civil war enthusiast. A comprehensive source of information on the uniforms of the Northern forces.Extremely well written and very well illustrated.
4,Good techno/dance/trance cd.,"I was looking for a good techno cd with Japanese lyrics, but unfortunately this album is completely in english. Aside from that, I like a lot of the beats. This cd is all over the place, mixing trance with hard rock, then shifting to dance on the very next track. I would suggest only to buy this if you have money to burn, or are extremely curious about Japanese club music. I do enjoy listening to it though, and don't feel it was a waste of money. The beats do get repetitive at times."
4,YMO's best album remixed,"Technodelic was always the Sgt. Pepper of electronic music weaving melodies, samples, clunky rhythms disturbed lyrics and disembodied vocals. Shed were video game melodies, cliche beats and theme song jingles.These new versions are playful, experimental, and true to their inspiration, but inconsistant. Not a song-for-song re-creation, 2000-01 contains a few substitutions. My 2nd favorite YMO remix collection after the (Orb's) Technodon II Remix CD. The cover is a spoof of Kraftwerk's Showroom Dummies/Robots at the keyboards using Ken-like dolls for YMO. Booklet continues the gag with various hip hop rave & DJ clad Kens representing the various remixers. If only Hosono, Orb, Richard Kirk, Clock DVA or some other cross-polination scheme collaborated.See also: YMO 'Technodelic' (1981); Technodon (a.k.a.'not YMO') 'Technodon' (1993); Technodon 'Remixes II' (by the Orb); (1993) YMO Reconstructed: 'Hi-Tech / No Crime'; Haruomi Hosono 'Mental Sports Remixes' (1993)"
2,Not up to par,"This was a nice, fast read on life on the Senior PGA tour, but I didn't overpay for it ($2.50 in a bookstore bargain bin). All of the various stars are profiled so quickly, for the most part, that you don't really get a good sense of life on the tour or what many of them are like. I think the author liked his research a little too much, and was determined to use it. This isn't completely without merit, but I think only good-sized golf fans will want to get it."
5,The Words That Remain,"SOLAS continues to thrill listeners like me who are looking for world music they can get next to. SOLAS offers celtic music that makes you want to dance, beat a drum and sing along to. Whether the song is traditional or contemporary, you listen with a wink and a smile!"
5,Wonderful,"This is Solas's best album yet. I thought that by the third album the music would sound the same, but that's not the case. The musicians are very talented and each song is arranged so beautifully that you never get bored with the music.My favorite song on the ablum is ""Song of Choice"". Iris Dement, a performer that I have enjoyed since I first saw her open a show for Nancy Griffith, accompanies Karan Casey on this song. They both have beautiful, unique voices, and the combination of the two is a winner.Just as on the other albums, I love the instrumental Reels & Jigs.Two of the songs are sung in Gaelic, a beautiful sounding language. An english translation of the songs are provided in the song list.If you ever have the opportunity to see Solas live do it! I have seen them three times and will continue to see them when they make stops in Chicago.I also recommend any Iris Dement album. My faviorite is her debut album ""Infamous Angel""."
5,Calculator,"It was just what my father was looking for! He needed a solar powered, large display, large button, desktop calculator. This one fit the bill to a tee!"
5,Best non-tape calculator I ever owned!,"I purchased this calculatorbecause I owned another one just like it since 1985. They are both the best non-printing calculatores I ever owned. The solar feature in this calculator makes it even better. It is noty a pocket calculator, but it is very portable in my bag. I mostly use it in my office on my second desk where I don't have room for a big bulky full size adding machine."
4,A Delightful Recording,"Here's another CD that I expected to hate, but Paul Winter won me over once again with a delightful recording. It is tempting to knock his mixing of wilderness sounds and music as a gimmick, but the fact is that with Paul Winter, they never sound like a gimmick. The man believes in what he is doing, and his sincerity wins over jaded old listeners like me. This truly is a musical celebration of the Northern Rockies, and I thank Paul Winter and musicians and engineers for letting me sit in my comfortable chair and take such a journey.No, I don't especially care for the painting that this CD promotes, and the New Age ambience of it all turns me off, but I find the end result musically captivating, and the audiophile in me marvels at the masterly blending of natural and synthetic sounds that make this CD a sonic showpiece. And let me say once again that if you ever get a chance to see Paul Winter perform live, by all means, do so. You'll be treated to a most rewarding evening."
4,Does the job.,"Great for creating CD labels that look good. Though the image that is posted here on Amazon says CD/DVD labels, the actual product only says CD labels."
5,Great Album SEE THEM LIVE!!!!!!,"I just saw them perform in Youngstown OH at nice and small venue so I was up close. They are amazing live, everything sounds so clean and well done. Its also very heavy live. They hung around afterwards to meet everyone. All of them are cool as hell. They cd itself is very good. If your a sevendust fan you will enjoy this cd but it is different from sevendust. They do have their own sound. One cool thing I liked is that all 5 of them do backing vocals and all of them do this well. Of course both of the Lowery brothers did this alot in past efforts(sevendust,stereomud and stuck mojo). Well enough typing go and check this cd out and then catch them live."
4,Not bad!!,"Great Live! Great bunch of guys ! Big doubleDrive fan and Great to see Troy! Really miss Mike Josh and Donnie! Would of been interesting to hear Donnie on this effort, oh that would of been Still Rain sorry!!"
4,Same Ol' Same Ol',"This is just another one of those bands that needs to stick to background music on TV shows, movies, and commercials. I have sat aside this CD ever since buying it. The song ""Brother"" will catch you. But if that is what gets you, the CD will die on you. It all is just the same stuff. It never changes. But there are some good songs on the CD. I don't know what really to say, Im stuck on this review. I cant say yes or no."
4,Dig Deeper,"I like all the bands that contributed members to this effort but I was able to see Brett Hestla live in Birmingham more than any of them with his bands Virgos Melot, Virgos and The Divine. For those of you mentioning the comparison to Alice in Chains, you need to find the CD from one of Brett's first bands called The Divine. The recording quality may not be quite as high as today's standards but the CD is still one of my favorites. It is about as close to Alice in Chains as you can get with a little techno/electric drums and Pantera thrown in. For those of you missing Virgos Merlot they have a new band with most of the same line-up minus Hestla called Red Halo (see [...]) They soarly miss Brett but the music is pretty good... especially live."
5,One of the best rock albums of 2005,"This CD completely blew me away when I first listened to it. Every thing you could ask for in a rock/hard rock cd is there. The guitar work is absolutely icredible for there genre. With 3 guitars in the band, and 1 bass guitar, THe boys in Dark new Day shred straight through the album with an assault of dark, heavy rythems, and awesome guitar solos. Brett has an icredible voice that fits right in with the music. The band's sound is almost completely different from other bands that I've heard. If you want sumthing different to listen to other than bands like crossfade and shinedown and metal bands like Mudvayne and Slipknot, then look no further. Highly recomended to any fan of good music. These guys rock.L8tr. \w/"
3,Good debut -- reeks a bit of Sevendust understandably,"These guys are really good, but reek a bit of Sevendust understanably so with Clint in the band, but the drummer has to give up on ripping the screaming riffs. It's been done and done better before you guys, but on a more optomistic note, the drummer's playing is really done well. Let the singer sing and you play the skins ( that's _your_ job ). McLawhorn shows off some impressive riffs and I will be listening for more influence from him on their follow up. Follow Thw Sun Down has great song design. Who wrote it? Barebones is the best song IMHO though. Keep up the good work guys. Decent debut."
3,Not bad...but still a ways to go.,"The line up is good with plenty of talent. If they can forget trying to sound eccentric and trying to ""stand out"" and just make good sounding music they'll be fine. The last thing we need is another Pearl Jam, Bush, STP, Revis, Mad at Gravity, etc. whose debut works were good but ended up going down hill from there.There are two five star songs on the album (Brother & Heal in Time). This is enough to convince me that they can really rock. I hope they do."
2,Lack of originality,"I just recently purchased the debut album from Dark new Day, and I was a little dissapointed. First off the thing that made me want the album was the lowery brothers were in it, so how could that be bad? I listened to the cd all the way through in my car and all of the songs were just boring to me and very ordinary, the first thing that came to mind was a cover band of sevendust and stereomud. I mean don't get me wrong it's not horrible, I just don't think it's worth buying."
2,"CD okay, live show better",I bought this CD after seeing Dark New Day play a show with Chevelle and Breaking Point at Rocketown in Nashville. The concertkicked major ass but the CD was kind of a let down. See them live if possible.
1,Please enter a title for your review,"Creativityless major label alt-rock scum. I'm amazed that there are still teens out there dumb enough to like this crap. The major label machine keeps pumping out these cloned sounding bands, occasionally some talented songwriting might slip by that they forget to stamp out (see The Buzzhorn's album for one rare example of this), but mostly they're redundant and harlmess enough that I just forget them after the first listen. Dark New Day really stand out as sounding like they have a ridiculously inflated sense of purpose as they churn out the same redundant riffs you've already heard from a hundred other bands without even managing a single memorable moment, and it's that psychosis that makes these guys truly the worst of the worst."
2,:barf:,"And the award for the most untalented faux macho radio metal band goes to...(surprise, surprise)So yeah, who really *likes* this band?Not I, said the king...Dark new day?Let me shed some light...Skrape...had one record, then disapeared (thank the goddess)Drive something or other (the fact that they're name isn't even memorable speaks volume)...did they even have a record? Oh yeah, it was the one that sold 20,000 copies (what a disgrace) on a major labelSevendust...hey, their new record is pretty good (wink, wink)Creed...When your bassist isn't alowed to appear in any band pics, and your lead singer swears he knows jesus better than god himself, you're probably not going to be too popular...what? they were a joke? you're kidding right!But hey, anything has got to be better than that new scott strap record, right?"
2,hey,"hey I r really don't give a crap about this band. if it has someone who was in creed in it, apparently it's gonna be no good. i was just wondering if anyone knew what happened to Skrape. I know their last album flopped real bad but it was still better than the majority of nu-metal out there. I'm pretty sure they are broken up but there's never any info about them anywhere so if anyone knows what happened to the band, post it on this CD."
2,Too many duds,"Most of the videos are simply duds. Only a few are worth a repeat viewing. But, of course, that's all a matter of taste.I think most people will be happy just because of ""White and Nerdy""."
3,Do the Whole Song Al,"As a Weird Al fan who lives in an area where Al rarely tours, I thought it'd be great to get the Alpocalypse Live DVD (Yeah, I didn't get the Blu-ray, but apparently Amazon doesn't sell the DVD. Well, if this is an example of how Al does his concerts, I'm not going to go to one anyway. For one, while the songs that were performed, were done well, there were a LOT of songs that there were only part of the song done, and I hate that. For Example, ""Rye or the Kaiser"", ""I Want A New Duck"", ""E-Bay"" and others were all either a verse, sometimes two, then right into the next song. I'm perfectly willing to drop my money on an Al album, but if this is how he does his concerts, I'll save my money."
3,Watch it and chuckle,"Isn't anyone tired of the same old plotlines? Girl becomes popular, loses her real friends, realizes in the end she is wrong, friends come back. Also, the same old love interest story. Overall, this movie is your typical Disney movie, which is just a fun cute movie to watch. The father in this story becomes completely annoying as he is running his own pizza parlor into the ground, but no one has the heart to tell him to stop (duh). The main character's book is a bit childish, why would everyone in the High School be reading it in the halls and be so excited about it??? There are more than a few goofs in this movie that are easily spotted. So the main character has a mental problem, fine, but they should have focused on that a little more I think to give more depth, but then again, it is a Disney movie not meant to be too serious."
1,Read it and Weep,I would love to have a review but I still haven't received my movie yet! It has been over a month and no movie! Would not recommend Amazon to anyone!
3,"GOOD ADVICE, BUT...","While the author points out some very important issues in a committed loving relationship (whether one is legally married or living common law, the same principles apply,)the book does not mesh with Buddhism. Buddha himself was married with a child and abandoned them in his quest for Enlightenment. The author does not even mention this very critical factor when she speaks of creating ""enduring relationships.""I would read the book for the helpful advice it contains in strengthening committed relationships - the book is worth the price for that alone. However, when it comes to the Spiritual Journey, and as a long-time follower of Buddhist philosophy, I would question just how knowledgeable the author truly is in true Buddhist Philosophy or Buddha himself. For this reason the book lost a couple of stars in the rating."
1,Worst Game Ever,"This is the worst game I have played for the PS2. I'm glad I only rented it. First off, the graphics are terrible. There are better games graphically for the Playstation. Only one of the cars is a liscenced rally car. The rest of them would make pathetic rally cars. When I think of rally cars I think of Subaru Imprezas and Pugeut 206s not Pontaic Grand Prixs and Vibes. Another low point is the physics. Cars handle the same on snow as they do on grass and concrete. If you stray from the road even a little distance your car slows down to a crawling speed. The courses don't look like rally courses either. I just don't understand driving through a city with skyscrapers and dirt roads. There are more weak points in the game, but I'm trying to keep this short, so in conclusion don't buy this game. If someone gives it to you don't play it. It will only waste your time and make you want to write a review like this one."
3,Good. but not gran turismo 3,"This game is cool. it could have been a lot better. gran turismo is way better. but if u like the pick up and race type game, it doesnt get much better than this. I like gran turismo way better though."
3,Paradoxically satisfied!!!,"This is a wonderful book. It shows how some Rossini arias were ornamented by my favorite singer, Marilyn Horne. I wish I could give it five stars, but I feel the publishers had better seize on the opportunity that M. H. is still alive and publish a book with ALL her Rossini triumphs. I can never get enough of anything related to Marilyn Horne.If you are Rossini mezzo or a serious voice teacher/coach, you must buy this book."
4,Interesting Read,"I enjoyed this book, but agree with the review, not long enough to really explore the intricacies of such a ridiculous situation. He doesn't try to go into some sort of sci-fi exploration of how scientifically this could happen, but takes the opportunity to explore the philosophical and emotional battles. Though too be fair, any more gratuitous sex, drugs and rock-n-roll and i would have been totally turned off by it. But I would have loved more exploration into the philosphical pull between intellect and physicality. I think Kureishi's mind is so fancy he could have really explored this topic and done some amazing things. I also didn't find think Adam wanted to return to the 60 something body because of fame or fortune, but because of family, love and intimacy."
3,3.5 stars,"What a strange little book. Part philosophy, part sci-fi. You know it can't be good to have your brain transplanted into another body!"
3,Starts off well but fades...,"I agree with the reviewer's take on this book: a really interesting premise and it starts off great, but then it shoots off in a bunch of strange directions. Not horrible but not great; I was expecting much more."
2,Just not up to snuff,"Reads like late Ballard (not a good thing). The characters are thin and obvious, and the retreat was handled far more expertly by Lorrie Moore in her story, ""Terrible Mother."" The penultimate scene is how he should have ended this novella. But as it is, he ends it on a curiously tyro note and here we are."
2,For Novices Only,"Community by Design is an introduction to the basics of community design and New Urbanism. It's useful if that's what you're after, but not an interesting read if you're anything but a novice on the the topic. It reads like a texbook for a freshman-level course in urban design. Used for that purpose, I'm certain it would be more than successful. As a source of new, insightful commentary on the subject of New Urbanism it falls more than a little short."
1,"poor design, poor workmanship","Poor design (no display, have to go through songs in sequential order they are loaded onto the device), battery didn't keep its power, it died after 3 months. Huge waste of money."
4,"Love it! Perfect for in pool workout, not just lap swimming.","I love this little gem. I am a pool walker, and to pass the time I actually hummed the Jeopardy theme song! I chose the Freestyle because it has a lanyard to wear around your neck. Other players hook onto goggles, which I do not wear to walk laps.The earbuds fit snug, and the sound is pretty good, not great. But when you swim (ears under water) the sound is AWESOME!Funny. It is easy to load, and my work-out goes by so fast!I think the freestyle would be a good choice for water sports, because of the secure lanyard."
1,Avoid this product!,"I bought mine, and it worked exactly one time. I was just doing water running, so it was never even submerged. It never worked again, so I was out $150, since I purchased it before the price reduced. I tried contacting the company, to no avail. It just wouldn't respond at all after that first time. It's not worth what you pay, and the company couldn't care less about the product once it's sold."
1,No quality,"There is no quality on this mp3. When it arrived, just looking on it's structure and headphone you can have a bad impression. After 4 or 5 times used, it stopped to work. No sound at all in or out of the watter. Waste of money, but maybe the problem is that I used it out of the water!!!!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"I purchased this product a few months ago and was able to use it only a handful of times before it completely stopped working. My story seems to be a common one, so do avoid this product."
4,A throne suits La Gencer,"Although this performance has appeared in a number of previous editions, the Opera D'Oro version has sound to match the best - and the price is right! Cappucilli is in his youthful prime and Anna Maria Rota, though without an intrinsically 'beautiful' sound, is stylistically correct and dramatically committed. The fly in the ointment is Bondino, whose evident commitment cannot overcome his bleating tone and vague sense of pitch. But of course it is for Gencer that enthusiasts will want this recording. The year of the performance, 1964, was Gencer's 'annus mirabilis' with not only this supreme interpretation (in the first revival in modern times) of Elisabetta, but magisterial interpretations of Beatrice di Tenda and Norma, among others. Very different from the equally valid interpretations of Sills and Caballe, Gencer's unique sense of line and of the use of words to color the music make her unique"
5,Pretty ladies! Sexy ladies!,"Utilizing the same cast that he used to make Veil of Blood (aka Vampire Ecstasy), Joe Sarno presents us with another well made piece of erotica. Some of the dialog is genuinely ridiculous (a situation not helped by the mixture of German & Swedish accents), but this tale of a teen girl's romp through bisexuality is genuinely sexy. Sarno knows how to shoot a good softcore sex scene, so who cares about the dialogue? You don't watch a film like this for the plot anyway."
2,That's so suite life of Hannah Montana,"My child didn't like this much as they thought it would be that's so Raven, The suite life of Zac and Cody and Hannah Montana altogether instead it was one episode of each.Only one episode had all 3 in it a big disappointment"
2,Too general,This book is too general. Maybe for people who never have seen windows is useful. I was looking for technical information but it is not there.
4,Thrilling performance,"This is a great recording! An example of how live opera recordings can outshine the studio recordings. Rysanek is astounding. She kept making my jaw drop. The indescribable sound she makes as she sees Jokanaan's head for the first time is worth the price of the cd. Chilling. The sound quality is ok, not great, but don't let it keep you from missing this staggering recording."
2,Get What You Pay for,"This may be one of the great interpretations of Salome, but the recording is so noisy you'll be hard put to tell. Rysanek is available for twice as much from another recording studio. I haven't heard that one, but I wish I'd given this one a miss and sprung for the extra ten bucks or so."
5,Great educational tool!!,"We received this as a gift for my one year old son because they know we are raising him to be bilingual. We didn't think he would pay much attention but he LOVES it. Its the only thing he can watch for more than two minutes. He watches all of the segments and i can honestly see that he is quite intrigued and is ""learning"". Would highly recommend it!!"
1,3D Glasses,I was very dissatisfied with this product. I have several movies done in 3D and the glasses did not preform the way they are supposed to.
1,This window needs windex,"Sorry I started the book.It had been highly recommended, but the author's use of spuriousdialogue made reading a chore.Finally put it down when I saw it wasn't going anywhere."
3,class assignment,"Ears was born and raised by a wheat field. Her mother taught her a secret song. Her and her siblings play games and have fun, but can not figure out what the song menas. Finally when Ears gets older she figures out what the song means. She decided to pass the song onto her babies.This was a good book. It helps kids learn about harvesting. The illustrations add to the adventure that Ears faces. I recommend this book for any kind of entertainment."
5,:( A great DVD that stopped at Season One,"This is a marvelous show. Brilliantly written and magnificently performed. The humor runs the gamut from giggly-cute to in-your-face. The characters are a whacky mix and the topics they discuss were sometimes very shocking in the 70's. This was a show that got people talking about these things, and helped them clear the air and have a good laugh about it. More than a few stubborn people had a change of heart thanks to this show.Wouldn't it be nice if Season Two was also available? Just think of all the great Season Two shows, languishing in the vaults, and nobody to enjoy them. Wouldn't it be nice if.....?"
1,Buy the DVD instead.,"Maude is great, but this format is unwatchable. Somehow in the conversion to digital they stretched and cropped the picture and lost the bottom one third of the screen. Frequently, you can only see Maude from the eyes up and being a tall woman this means your frequently only seeing the tops of other actors heads. I saw this problem with the first three episodes before I gave up and decided to seek a refund. The physical DVD has gotten great reviews so I recommend ordering that."
5,Maude season 1,This was hilarious- I hadnt seen it in years- cant wait for season 2- I want them all- it was such a funny show back then and still is- I just loved it and I reccomend everyone to get it who ever liked that show- its very worth it- Sharon from Ft Lauderdale
4,Significant for topic,The topic is very significant and absolutely would not be controversial today. The writing was not truly purposeful. This episode is often noted as a slice of life moment in television in the last half of the 20th century.
3,"Wow, what a show","I remember watching this show on occasion back in the 70s and didn't like it cuz Maude always seemed so darn crabby. But that was before I finally understood looks aren't necessarily that obvious. Translation: there's more to what meets the eye.I'd been wanting to watch it again, and it was good to once I bought it at a store (this is one of some shows I didn't order at Amazon). I enjoyed it and already watched everything here twice, so hopefully the 2nd season will be released soon."
5,"More maude, please.","Hi. I need other seasons of Maude because is the best. I live in Italy and there's no Maude's dvds on my language, so i have to buy it from the States, without subtitles at all! Despite that, my english is good enough ( not much but enough )to laugh with the gratest series i have ever seen. Please Sony, more Maude. Thank You."
5,God'll getcha if you don't buy it,"It's about time! The magnificent ""All In The Family"" spin off is a joy to watch again again and again. Anxiously awaiting Season 2,3,4,5,etc...""And for what you're thinking, bite your tongue"""
5,Hip Hip Hooray!,"All I can say is that it's about time. There must be thousands of us Maude fans who have been waiting for this DVD. I play it anytime I need a lift or a laugh, which is pretty often. There is no actress alive or dead like Bea Arthur. She was born to play the role of Maude even topping her role as ""Dorothy"" in the Golden Girls. The supporting cast is also wonderful, especially ""Walter"".Where oh where are the subsequent seasons? I hope it won't take Sony forever to distribute them. If it does, they will certainly be worth waiting for!"
3,Great Start!,"Season 1 of Maude, while a welcome release, is not as hilarious as later seasons. No Baby Sally telethon. No UFO sightings. No class reunions. There are only a handful of classics here, but for the die-hard Maude fan who has waited FOREVER for this release, it's a must-have. It does, however, include the highly controversial 2-part episode where Maude finds out she is pregnant at 47 and debates over whether or not to have the baby. This was a big deal in 1972! Among the other scattered memorable episodes are Walter's 50th birthday party, Arthur's stay at the Findley's while his house is being repaired from a fire, and Florida's arrival as the new maid before she went off to ""Good Times"". Look for Rue McClannahan in gray hair during one of the earlier episodes. She later turns up with the blond 'do' that she keeps through the rest of the series.This set has no extras/special features/commentaries."
1,VDCUSA Stinks,"I recently placed an order for an item I did not receive and was charged for it by VDCUSA and, to make matters worse, they shipped an item I did not order so I am burdened with having to return the item. GRRRRRRR.Needless to say, I will not be ordering from them again.A very dissatisfied customer."
5,Works Perfectly,"My husband is quite pleased with the Heater Valve. Since I know nothing about such a guy thing, I've relied on his opinion, which is very favorable. Can't believe I found this on Amazon."
3,A fantasy tale,"with fighters, mages, and healers. Conor is fighter and husband. Eithne is his wife and a healer. They chance upon a young 9 year old mage who has chosen to runaway rather than continue living with the abuse of his father. Bandits find Rhoyd and the couple saves him. Little do they know that the rare mageborn is being hunted down by Socorro, a brilliant man who needs mages in order to extend his own life."
4,Great Book,"I just finished the book and found it facinating. It has a good story line and the characters are well developed and facinating. She created a world of magic and made it real. This is the first one of her books I have read, but I will read them all. Yard Dog Press has really great books and wonderful authors."
4,Great reference,Excellent book for a collector. However it's kind of pricey for a catalog that most collectors would like to buy every year to stay up with the latest info.
4,Find the listings,"Great book and I too was looking for those listings.Found them on sams webpage. Search for the author (ashbacher), you'll find one reference (to this book and its listings in the download section)."
2,CAUTION,"I just got this book because it met my need to learn XML. My review at the bookstore was confirmed as a purchase because the book seem easy to read and could get me through learning this application pretty smoothly. I've bought other Sam's Publishing Teach Yourself series and really enjoy them.However, when I got home, I needed the source code to do my exercises which the book advises they are available online at Sam's and also provided the author's email address. For the publishing company, they no longer support this book and source is not available. For the author, his mailbox is full and I am sitting here dreading having to type all that source code.So if you want it, good luck, but be aware of my own deliemma. If you've got it and have the source code, let me hear from you."
3,Good book but you need more time to get the value out.,"This book isn't necessarily bad. But some of the other reviews are on target. Some of the code samples do have typos, which cause you to spend an hour or so to figure out what is wrong.You must plan to spend a good deal of time with the material. Its akin to taking a class for a grade, where much of the knowledge comes by learning from your mistakes. You do learn much more this way, but requires more time."
1,Teach Yourself XML in 24 years maybe!,"Don't waste your money. Poorly written, difficult to follow, many of the examples in the first chapters do not work, extremely confusing. He expects you to type all of the code yourself. I came to see if it was just me and it isn't. It didn't deserve one star but that is as low as it goes."
1,"If I could give this book a zero, I would","I don't know who the intended target audience for this book was, but it's definately not the average computer user who is trying to learn a little more about XML.Realistic applications for his code are in short supply, and it would have been nice to have shown how popular sites put XML to work. I realize that JavaScript is the most accessible scripting language for XML, but languages like PHP and perl(to mention a few) combined with parsing tools like Expat and SAX use it way more often with far more practicality. Even Flash ActionScript uses it more efficiently. That wasn't even acknowledged in this book.There are far too many things wrong with this book that I don't have enough space to mention them all. If anything, this is the epitome of how NOT to teach a subject. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK."
2,A Poorly Written Book,"I bought this book and then returned it:1. The examples - even in the first chapter - are poorly explained.2. Many code examples are very long, and there is no way to get these codelets pre-written either by CD or download. You are expected to type them in by yourself, which is a huge waste of time.3. I found the chapters poorly organized.A waste of money. Go out and get ""Beginning XML"" instead. Much better."
1,"Very unprofessionally presented,insistent, difficult to read","I bought this book hoping that it would be as helpful as other SAMS's ""Teach yourself..."" publications. However, even I know other web programming languages such as HTML, ASP and JavaScript, I found this book very difficult to read and understand.It contains codes that were poorly presented and with syntax errors (has this book been proofread at all?). It doesn't explain the concept behind the code and tend to write long, complicate statements where a short, simple one will do.I tried very hard but have to give up after reading one quarter of the book. Until now I still don't have a clear picture of how to structure a XML code, and the more I read, the more questions remain unanswered. Now I am looking for another XML book and probably have to start from the beginning."
1,Way too messy to learn from,"I already have a good foundation in HTML and Javascript, but around chapter 3 and 4 this is getting a little obscure. The code examples from the website don't correlate, and it's becoming a mess (which is why I've come here to share this with you and look for better book).Leave it on the virtual bookshelf."
2,"It looked good when I picked it up, but...","I picked this book up in the store, and it looked good compared to the others out there. However, I'm finding that it is not as thorough nor as simple a guide to XML as some of the alternatives. The examples are unevenly explained. There isn't a lot of detail on syntax. The examples on the website (""Save yourself the typing!"") are organized by chapter, but do not have perfect correspondence in their filenames to the titles of the examples in the book. The one saving grace is that the lessons are shorter than an hour, each.On good alternative is Jan Egil Refsnes' XML101 website. It is very straightforward, and free, although there isn't a great deal of pure narrative. I have also heard good things about the Wrox book, ""Beginning XML"" but haven't had a chance to look at it."
3,Makes it more difficult than it is IMO,"I already had a good foundation of using HTML before purchasing this book. When I bought this book, I was hoping it would build a basic foundation for me in XML.Instead I found it gave me little time to build any foundation and just took off on page 13. I have since bought Step by Step XML and Begining XML and find that this is a much better place to start. I only wish that I had known this from the begining. Now that I already understand XML, I can use this book to help me."
1,Incredible number of typos...,"I know everyone who has rated this book had mentioned the typos. But, isn't this a major problem? This is a teaching book. If the examples won't work without the reader having to edit the copy as they are trying to learn, it seems to defeat the purpose of book.Also, the exercises are a bit monotonous. How about some varied content with a wider range of examples. After a while, examples started bleeding together when I went back to review previous lessons.I've purchased Sam's books in the past and been pleased. However, this one I should have skipped."
1,There are many typos in this book!,Typos in the code examples make this a very difficult book to learn from.
3,"Fair, but see the Powell set.","The Niven Signature Collection includes three movies and a selection of trailers. The three features: THE LADY SAYS NO (1951: she hates men and is `saucy,' yet Niven's a dashing fashion photog; with Joan Caulfield), HAPPY GO LOVELY (1951: she asks Niven to pretend he's Laird of the Keep, but he really is Laird of the Keep; with Vera-Ellen), and A NIGHTINGALE SANG IN BERKELEY SQUARE (1979: bank heist; with Elke Sommer). Newspaper reviews said ""Lady"" was ""a limp comedy"" and ""Happy"" was ""featherweight yet charming"" and ""Nightingale"" was a ""quirky comedy"". Folks, I suggest the wonderful ""A Matter of Life and Death"". In it, Niven accidentally doesn't die and when Heaven comes to claim him he pleads a change of circumstances - his newfound love for Kim Hunter. Sony released it in startling rejuvenation at Martin Scorsese's request. On DVD it's part of Sony's solid director set ""Michael Powell""."
1,Baffled,"Like two others, I'm baffled as to why this is advertised as having""The Impossible Years"" on the dvd. That is what I thought I ordered and wasVERY disappointed when it arrived with 3 movies I have never heard of. Still looking for ""The Impossibel Years"" if anyone knows where it can be found."
1,No match,"I searched for ""Prudence and the Pill"" (I am ALWAYS searching for that movie), not sure why this was selected as a match...still searching."
4,Impossible Years Found,The Impossible Years has been released as part of the WB's Archive Collection. It has been re-mastered and is available for under $20.
2,Disappointed,"This video came up in response to a search for the movie Prudence and the Pill, along with some memorabilia from the movie. Shame on me, I didn't look to see that the DVD doesn't include the movie I wanted. The DVD features David Niven, the star of the movie. If anyone comes across copies of the movie, please sell them on Amazon!"
1,"David Niven, Signature Collection: is def not The Impossible Years","This dvd tells about David Niven's Entertainment History, but, it does not include The Impossible Years. I am trying to find that title on dvd and am not having any success. You would think that they would have put it out by now. I have Candleshoe, the Bishop's Wife, and others."
1,Not As Promised,"I bought this dvd with the assumption it contained the film ""The Impossible Years"". It did not however. It did include three Niven films, but not the title I had searched for. Dissapointed - still looking for my movie!"
1,Dont watch movies like this anymore,"I dont watch movies like this anymore, so I wouldnt recommend it. The south park guys are funny, but I have moved on in my life."
4,cheaper and easier than pro printing,"This product works very well. When used with a good quality printer, the results are very good. The downloadable MS word templates can be a challenge to work with depending on what you are doing though."
5,Worked,We needed to have something this size to print out directions from my ceremony location to my reception. This worked perfectly for my needs.
3,not good for advertising,"don't get this if your going to advertise your business....you need GLOSS!this is not what i expected but i cannot give it bad ratings, because it is what it says it is."
2,Perforations are a problem,The perforations do not tear well and it is obvious that you have used perforated paper. Do not turn out professional at all. Will not use these again.
2,Does not work with Epson printers,"I was frustrated beyond belief trying to print with these cards on a brand new Epson All-In-One printer. It recognized that the paper was present probably 1 out of 20 times and only printed a handful of cards in 2 hours of trying. When I called Epson, they said heavy card stock doesn't work on their printers. I have to now spend a bunch of money at Kinko's to finish my project, so, NO, THIS ITEM IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH MOST INKJET PRINTERS."
5,AMAZING!!!!,I did a 300 piece mailing with these glossy post cards and I received nothing by compliments! I just ordered two more packs. They are AMAZING!!! I recommend it highly.
3,Dissapointed with the descriptions,"Whilst there was some hype aboput being postcards and approved for mailing, when I received the stock, the cards were in fact blank on both sides. This was a surprise as no picture or info on the set up of the stock was available from the manufacturer or from Amazon. The product was suitable for the purposes intended, with just additional work required to print the Avery website template on the back of each card.More clear explanation would have been appreciated."
1,never thought I would feel strongly about paper,"but this item made me want to throw it and my printer out the window. I jammed constantly when I was printing several hundred postcards. I had to feed it in one sheet at a time. I ended up using about 3 packs of these, so I don't think it was just a bad pack. Absolutely horrible."
2,"Seller is great, product could be better","You couldn't ask for a better seller, DealBarn did everything right. I do think Toshiba could make a charger that lasts longer. From what I've read early failure is common with this charger."
1,Another victim of Toshiba AC adapter,"My original Toshiba AC adapter has broken after an year and the 2nd one lasted only for 3 months. After reading the product reviews I have decided not to buy another, I have soldered the matching tip and working good."
1,bad plug,"this item worked for the first few weeks. I stopped using my laptop as much as i use to. After a while the green light on the transformer stopped turning green and after pushing the cord in harder and wiggling it would stay on. Yesterday, i noticed one of the plug prongs was slightly bent so i used a little force to bend it back and it snapped off!! Now i'm without a power adapter for my laptop!"
1,Counterfit Charger *NOT* Toshiba OEM,"I received mine from ""SF Planet"" - these chargers are not the same ones you'd get from buying them from Toshiba directly, we sent one to our authorized Toshiba repair place and were told they are not OEM, not made by Toshiba, and counterfit. Someone is just slapping fake labels on these and selling them as toshiba products.Now that said, I was expecting these to be fake for the price, Toshiba sells these for $100 plus so for less than $20, something had to be wrong.So far it works fine, but they are deceiving people in trying to sell them as Toshiba OEM."
4,Toshiba 65W AC Adapter,"Bought this to replace my original Toshiba power cord that was a piece of rubbish. My old cord completely died out...I had to have it in a certain position in order for the power to go through. On top of that, my battery was completely dead. This came in the mail and it works great! The only thing I would say is that the cord is a bit shorter than the original cord. And the AC adapter part pulls easily off of the AC power cord. Over all, it does its job!"
3,Its ok,"I bought this charger and its not very durable considering its brand name. Well, the port is all ready bent. Defective,"
1,Arrived broken and no reply from them yet.,"I ordered the power supply and I plugged it in and nothing. I tapped the transformer and got intermittent power. Now it doesn't work at all. I sent an email back the thebatterycenter and got an auto reply that they want 100% satisfaction. Well, not quite 10% satisfied yet."
5,best charger yet,This is by far the best charger that I have purchased so far. My chargers seem to break easily from all of the wear and tear but this has by far lasted the longest.
1,adapter very bad,"en four days no working more .is bad. el cargador en menos de 4 dias ya en el enchufe no trabajaba , en que va para la corriente, esta muy mal fabricado."
2,"Worked okay, but had to be in a certain spot...","Worked great as long as it was in a certain spot. Product was as described and shipping was very fast. However when I plugged it in, it would only work if the plug was in a certain a position. Therefore I had to return it. No issues getting a refund."
1,Lasted only 5 months,"My original adapter stopped working. Purchased this one in October 2011. It's now March 2011, and the cord has a short in it. Most adapters sold on Amazon have a 12 month warranty. This one DOES NOT. Spend a few extra dollars and get one that does come with the warranty...it's a better product."
2,Doesn't last at all.,"I just received this item like two-three weeks ago and it's already not working. It is not to the point where it has to be a certain position for it to work, but it it only wants to work sometimes. It's not worth it."
3,Cheap and works UPDATE it kinda broke,Its worked so far. I read a lot of reviews that said it burns out after a month. But its been three weeks and works fine. I make sure not to leave it charging all night just in case it wants to burn out. Definitely worth it so far.UPDATE: so just recently (4 months since purchase) the part that meets the computer has gotten extremely picky. It now takes two minutes of fidgeting to get the plug to make the connection and charge. My battery is super old and dies in 30 seconds so this makes my computer more of a desktop than laptop. still glad i didnt pay 120 for a legit one.
2,Was Great for about a Minute,"This product worked well for about a month and a half, but now I'm having to buy another one because the adaptor isn't not connecting with my laptop."
4,Toshiba Global Laptop Charger,Was delivered on time and am thoroughly pleased. Wish it was two pronged instead of three...some places don't offer three prong outlets.
4,Laptop A/C adapter,"An A/C adapter isn't a particularly exciting purchase. It either fits and works or it doesn't. In this case, the adapter both fit and worked. The description would lead one to believe it was the branded product, but for the price, a functional off brand is fine.After about a week, the product failed. I'm not an Electrical Engineer, but I do understand stuff happens. What I do appreciate is that the retailer (Acctronics) responded quickly to an email about the failure and shipped a new one with no further explanation or delay. This was exceptional customer service, and I certainly appreciate that."
3,Toshiba AC Adapter,"Product was exactly as described. If you are not in a hurry for this product, then I would recommend this company. If you are, then I would look elsewhere. Although I chose to pay for the expedited shipping, the product took well over a week to two weeks to arrive."
1,not working at all,"This product is defective, not working at all, the wire is short. I returned it and very good service in return department."
3,Buyer Beware,I bought this adapter for a low price from a random seller and it stopped working after a week. I then paid a lot more to buy a second one directly from Amazon- this one actually works well. You get what you pay for when it comes to this product.
4,Needed Power,The original Toshiba unit died within 1 year of normal use. I hope that this one is more durable and will last longer.
3,"Useful as a college text, but not for front-line analysts","I am responsible for a 50+ person intrusion detection mission, and I read this book in August 1999. Had I not read Stephen Northcutt's ""Network Intrusion Detection,"" I may not have given Dr. Amoroso's work three stars. Unfortunately, by catering to a niche audience (probably graduate students), this book is not very helpful to folks under fire from malicious Internet users. Dr. Amoroso is very respected in the field, but I would have preferred less process charts and taxonomy descriptions. The publisher does a disservice by stating on the back cover ""System administrators, programmers, system and software engineers, and managers of technology will find this book invaluable."" Had the book been advertised as a college text, I would have been less critical. Sorry Dr. Amoroso -- I look forward to your next book, though!"
2,Repetitious is correct....,"I agree with another reviewer that too many things in this book were continually and unnecessarily gone over / described again and again which got me a bit bored at times. Overall this book just seemed kind of lame to me, I probably wouldn't recommend it."
2,Don't recommend this book!,"Erika Bischoff has opened the spa resort of her dreams. During a week when she has a full house, including her friend. retired detective Molly May, one of the guests is found dead. He is industrial baron Harvey Ruger, who hasn't made any friends since he arrived.This book is a very slow starter. It takes about a third of the book to introduce all the players and then, finally, a body is found. The dialog is a little stilted and the characters are stereotypical except for when they step completely out of the bounds of normal behavior.I can't recommend this book."
5,Brilliant Mystery Combined with Folk Tale,"This book is a combination of folk tale, mystery, and extended comedy routines. Number 10 Ox is sent to find a learned scholar who can solve the mystery of why a plague has hit the young children in his village. He ends up with Master Li, a brilliant drunken scoundrely Confucian scholar, and they go on a quest throughout China to solve a mystery, find a mythical creature and possibly help out some gods. Wonderful, charming and funny. I can not recommend this enough."
5,Godlike.,"One of the best books I've ever read. One of, I'm sure, the best books ever written.In a world full of Eddings and Feist and Goodkind, Hughart's books are triumphs of witty,lean, well-written, insanely funny, and heartwarming writing. Bridge of Birds is, quitesimply, one of the books that I'm geniunely sad when I finish, because it's now over, andI have to leave the world that Hughart built for me."
4,Entertaining and unusual,"This unusual book about seventh century China is a strange combination of historical novel, adventure, mystery, fantasy, fairy tale, and myth, with the best attributes of each genre. It is crammed with colorful characters and wonderful bits of folklore.At first, I wasn't sure I liked the book. The pacing seemed a bit off, and some key story elements were so subtle and oblique that I had to re-read passages to make sure I understood what what going on. I also found the killing of one of the minor characters to be cold and incredible (as in ""not credible""). However, I stuck with the story, and it really started to grow on me. The pace picked up, the story became far more involved, and the ending was stunningly beautiful. In short, I'm really glad I read it. I'll definitely be trying another of Hughart's books."
3,Conflicted,"The good: Often funny, with beautiful imagery. The last third or so of the book is lovely and moving, and the finale cinematic in scope and depiction. Several ancillary characters' stories are genuinely moving.The bad: Sexist, racist, and, for the first two thirds of the book, entirely too lightweight and disposable for my taste. The two main characters are never more than sketchy outlines, and the romance that is supposed to anchor the second half of the book has no weight."
4,"Very enjoyable ""fantasy"" novel","Not your typical fantasy story, but more of a revisionist historical novel set in a ""fantasy"" setting...what makes this novel so amazing are the characters - Master Li, Number Ten, and literally every single person they come across in their epic journey. My one flaw is with Number Ten Ox, the narrator. Of all the characters in the story, both male and female...he comes across as the weakest. I never truly felt like I got his character as much as the others. But other than that, I loved this book!! The Duke of Ch'In, the Man in the Mountain, Jade Pearl, Miser Shen...so many hilarious and memorable characters that aid and deter our leads on their journey of finding the Great Root of Power!!!! Great book!!"
2,not really what I had thought it would be,"I picked up this book thinking of it as a fantasy novel, however I felt disappointed. Instead of non-stop action, intrigue, or even any type of excitement, I found it to be slow and unsuprising. I do not understand why it is classified as a fantasy novel, other than the fact that it is fiction. I finished the book, however it was quite a chore. One major thing that bothered me was the weird references to sex. I mean, one moment the main character is playing lookout, the next he's talking about spying on some couple having sex. To top it off, it turns out that the couple are nothing more than insects. If you are looking for something that is filled with dragons, myths and excitment, this is definately not the book for you."
5,Good book!,"This book really surprised me in how good it turned out to be. The first couple chapters went kind of slow so I thought the book was going to be mediocre or just barely worth a read. I was so wrong! Don't let the boring title and front cover fool you!The book gets so much better! I love how everything in the book ties in together! I mean all the characters you meet, you see again later when they pop up in surprising ways. The book is like a masterful puzzle that in the end all the pieces fit together and you get to see the whole great wonderful picture. I couldn't put this book down!"
5,Exhilarating - The best book I've read this year,"I've never read anything like Bridge of Birds, and I spent my first law school semester re-reading it in my spare time. With few exceptions, I never had any idea what was going to happen. I laughed like a loon during one of the murder scenes - I don't want to give away any more, but it was deliciously ironic - and was humbled by the intellect of the character who figured out the overarching mystery. The last few chapters were like a roller coaster. I felt like I was flying during the climax, and that alone would have prompted an eventual reread and reccommendation. I can't *not* reccommend Bridge of Birds to everyone, but I am aware that those who dislike complex storytelling would be totally confused before they got anywhere in the book. I will now go off in pursuit of modestly-priced copies of the other two Hughart novels..."
5,Wanted: More Master Li and Number Ten Ox,"In case you don't trust all of the other reviewers, allow me to interject my praise for Hughart's World Fantasy Award winning first novel. Here are my adjectives: uproarious, delightful, imaginative, and sentimental (in a good way). Master Li and Number Ten Ox's romp through mystical China is sly, adventurous, and worth reading more than once. I read somewhere that the publishing bureaucracy irritated Hughart so much that he stopped writing, and that's a shame. More Master Li and Number Ten Ox is exactly what the genre needs right now."
5,"A mad, wonderful, beautiful, frantic, inspired book.","Not to repeat all the other reviews, but everyone I know who has read this book is pretty much speechless. They mostly just nod and go ""wow..."". And just to add, if you read this book and don't weep with joy and pain at the end, you have my deepest sympathy and a heart of stone."
5,My all-time favorite book - - and I read a LOT!,"Please see my complete reviews below...you'll have to scroll a bit, but I'm down there.There is no other favorite book in the world for me. ""Bridge of Birds"" has it all...and in such a wonderfully wrapped story, too!Buy this book...you will not be sorry!"
3,Imaginative but too delayed with the follow-through,"For most of its length, Bridge of Birds felt like a meandering dream, along the lines of, ""so my mom was making pancakes using rice, but then my brother ate all the flour so we had to go to the store, but it was a hardware store...."" Then, on page 238, I realized that the story had suddenly condensed towards a fun and engaging purpose built upon all of the pleasant, rambling adventure that had been laid out. Recommended as a diverting tale, but don't expect it to feel like it's going anywhere until near the end."
4,Dodge Engine Model,Great model but a bit more complicated than expected. This is definetly for older kids. To many small parts and is for the serious modeler.
3,Nice but not quite good,"I got this kit and the Drag Race engine kit in December.The block is diecast metal, but the rest of the kit is plastic.Fit of the parts could be better, but the biggest flaw, for me, is the color. The color of the engine is street Hemi orange. Race Hemis were painted in orange more on the yellow side. I was invovled in racing one of the A990 65 Dodges and the color stands out in my mind.The price was good so I can't really complain. I just wanted to point out those inconsistencies."
5,Just as described,Absolutely love this game which is why I purchased it again after my son lost the first one. Just as the seller described!
5,Beautiful and often played,"Since I first listened to this album years ago I knew it would rank up there with ""Icarus"" as one of my favourite Paul Winter albums of all time (also one of my favourite of anybody's music). Recorded in one of his favourite places to play, the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in NYC, and joined by his long-time friends and collaborators Paul Halley and Eugene Friesen (and others) the songs have that lightness-of-being and beauty that any fan of Paul Winter's has come to expect and will always appreciate. I have to confess that I don't just listen to it in the winter-time; winter just gives me an excuse to play it more often! If you enjoy consummate artistry, music that is uplifting without making you giddy, and want to listen to music that you can never be ashamed of and will want to share with others then get this. This CD goes with me whenever I travel. This year I am purchasing a few to give away as gifts."
5,wonderful wintersong!,I was so excited to find this on cd! I've loved it since I first heard it about 20 years ago! My brother actually worked at The Cathedral of St. John the Divine where it was recorded. It is absolutely beautiful and does not neccessarily have to be reserved for only the Christmas season.
2,or sex and sin,I thought the idea behind the novel in a sense was good. However on page 3 there was already oral sex mentioned. It was just too much for me. I skipped to the end. It seemed well done at that point.
1,WHAT!,"i am sorry i never write reviews i mean never but, i felt like no one ever tells you what is going on completely. so in the very beginning of the book i mean very beginning the hero is getting a blow job. now i hate this, for me it shows the type of man, then as the book went on i swear it just got worse. so don't wast your money leave this on alone"
5,Sin & Sensability,"I really liked this book. It had humor, romance and a cliff hangar. I usually try and guess what is going to happen, but this book caught me off guard two different times. Loved it."
2,Is 2* too much?,"At one time Ms. Enoch was my favorite romance writer. I even bought all her old novels (on amazon, no less, AND they were NOT cheap, some going for $20) That is how much I really liked her style of writing. I don't know what has changed...I know we can all get into a funk here and there. Maybe it is because I have found some other great authors too, so it's just not Enoch anymore. Her last 2 novels, this book along with ENGLANDS GREATEST HERO just has not been up to snuff compared with her earlier works. I feel like she could be writing much better stories and creating much more interesting and complex characters than she has been doing lately. There use to be a lot of intensity and passion between the hero and heroine, therefore creating some good juicy dialogue,so that you are really savoring the book AND not being able to put it down. I just kept waiting for the book to get better and it never did. Very disappointing."
5,"Typical regency, but that's not a bad thing at all!","Ignore the negative reviews - this is indeed the ""usual"" regency romance, but then that's why regency fans read themm isn't it? Enoch takes us back to a time when girls were virginal and modest, but secretly longed to be swept away by a scandalous but romantic black sheep. Nell has promised to obey her brother guardians and marry as expected of a woman of her station, but when they assign their friend, the Marquis of Deverill, to keep an eye on her, her resolve is tempted. This is a fine, funny, sensual, romantic regency romp, and fans of the genre won't be the least disappointed."
1,Could our Heroine be any more immature????,"I agree that this book features two of the most immature characters that I've read. Eleanor Griffin, who is tired of being protected by her big brother, Sebastian, spends the entire story proving him right that she needed to be watched because she is not a grown up. Her method of seeking her ""freedom"" is well, dumb. Valentine, the rake, has ""issues"" but why would he even be intersted is such a silly girl? I started skimming this book after a while. Don't waste you time!!"
1,Crude,It was a rather crude story at times. I am surprised at this for her other stories aren't that crude. I don't know if I will read other stories in this series.
4,Sin and Sensibility,"Lady Eleanor Griffin feels suffocated by her brothers' overbearing attention. She makes a ""declaration of independence"" and is allowed some freedom on the condition that she does not cause scandal to the family name. Unbeknownst to her, her eldest brother, the duke of Melbourne, asks his best friend the Marquis of Deverill to keep an eye on her. Big big mistake!! (or was it intentional??) Valentine is a notorious rake and he finds himself fighting his growing attraction to Eleanor. The encounters between Eleanor and Valentine are extremely enjoyable, full of wit, humor, and sensuality. Eleanor and Valentine are great as a couple. I did not really understand the criticism against Eleanor. After all she was living in a time when a little freedom meant the world to a woman. It is no wonder she felt a bit confused and undecided about what to do. As for Valentine, I completely enjoyed his transformation even if I found it a bit exaggerated at the end."
2,Not the best from a great author,"I have loved every book I have read from Suzanne Enoch. I was so excited to get this book and yet from the first 5 pages I knew it was not up to the standards I have come to count on from this author. It took me several nights to get thru to the end and it was almost a task vs. a pleasure to read it. The characters and chemistry were dry and lacked the usually snappy dialog that keeps us fans engaged. I did not get the reason the herione felt so trapped and the constant tension with her family members seemed silly and was over written to the point it was annoying. I hope the next historical follows the examples of the much better ""London's Perfect Scoundrel"", ""Taming Rafe"", ""Reforming a Rake"" and ""Meet me at Midnight"". These were exciting page turners you could not put down and had heros and heriones you really loved."
1,Boring!!!!!!!! I didn't even bother to finish the book!!!,What can I say? I got the book because the average ratings were a 3 to 4 stars. The book was boring. It was slow and the plot was pathetic. Only the brothers had some personality. It was a waste of my money!!!
3,It was okay,There just wasn't enough character development. It doesn't help when the heroine isn't very likeable. She spends the entire book whining about how she wants freedom and adventure. When her brothers agree to ease up she still complains. The characters just aren't very mature.
3,Disappointed,"..especially since the last Suzanne Enoch novel, ""London's Perfect Scoundrel"" that I've read was amazing. I understand where Eleanor is coming from in her quest for ""freedom"" but the entire thing is not well executed. She came off as immature, indecisive, whiny, and spoiled. Valentine could have been a great hero but the author fell short in giving him the kind of depth a rake needs to make him likeable and capable of reforming some of his wicked ways. Only the fact that Valentine has some common sense in him and that he feels a sense of responsbility towards Eleanor saves him from falling into the same pit as Eleanor. I'm guessing from the title, ""Sin"" is represented Eleanor and ""Sensibility"" is represented by Valentine.The only reason I got through the novel was the appearance of the 3 Griffin brothers, whose stories I can wait to read."
2,Waste of time,This was a totally implausible and boring plotline and I don't understand how some readers found it risque or sizzling. I have to agree with the reviewers who disliked Nell because there was very little character development in this novel. It takes very little time for her to decide she is in love with Valentine and he does very little to resist her even though he is ruining his best friends' sister. I prefer Julia Quinn or Lisa Kleypas.
4,Sizzling!,"This was not Ms. Enoch's best story, but I think Valentine Corbett is my favorite rake to date!The plot is outlined most thoroughly in the other reviews, but I just wanted to add that I thought the tension between Eleanor and Corbett simply sizzled.I don't consider it a waste of my money and plan to read it again."
2,JT hanging out,Way too boring to even finish watching. I love Justin but this DVD is BORING! Disappointing.
4,"Works well,","Easy to install, proper size for 3-4 plastic shopping bags, Only problem is I have a bike w front suspension and had to modify it slightly to use"
5,Perfect fit,I got this basket to ride my Dachshund around. It is a perfect match to my back basket and he fits perfectly.
4,nice basket,this is a nice basket to have. I am using it on my schwinn cruiser. It the perfect size for quick trips to the store and will hold a couple of bags with ease.
2,A fine Big basket that will not hold much weight.,This basket looked perfect for my needs. I just converted my bike to electric and wanted to move the battery weight to the front of the bike. It worked great for about a week. Then I took it on a dirt road and the weight of the batteries just crumpled the supports. I will be enjoying the basket and the bike just as soon as I devise a way to strengthen the supports. For such a large basket it really should have stronger supports.
2,can't be used on a bike with front suspension or springer fork,"This is a beautiful basket, but the description page does not tell you that it cannot be used on bikes with front suspension or springer forks. How was I to know? I found out when I received the basket with instructions - telling me DO NOT use on my kind of bike.Now I have to return this, and shop again and wait again - for another basket that attaches only to the handlebars."
4,it doesn't really fit my bike,"I put this basket on an old Schwinn Collegiate, but the handlebars are a little low. HOWEVER, with some adjustments, I can make it work. Its fun and feels really sturdy."
5,A trippy mellow gem!,"Amazing work! Grouse (Ronan Carroll) combines intricately interwoven dreamy layers of music producing a wonderfully rich narrative tapestry. There are obvious influences of Gorillaz (particularly on Twisted), of Kruder + Dorfmeister, and of Moby - with undertones of Pink Floyd, Massive Attack and Zero7. Make no mistake however, this is an artist with a definite musical vision and voice of his own. Self-produced in his San Francisco studio, this debut effort heralds the emergence of a remakable new talent.Paradoxically, while there is something new to discover on each listening, the album makes for perfect background music - down tempo, mellodic, and trippy - the perfect accompaniment to a good book on a rainy afternoon. Buy it!"
3,Maria Stuarda,"A LIVE PERFORMANCE HAS A SPECIAL FLAVOR BUT OFTEN THE SOUND IS NOT OPTIMUM . ALSO THERE WAS SOME DAMAGE, THUS DISTORTION AT THE BEGINNING OF THE FIRST DISK.rjb"
2,Not recommended,"An off-night for Caballe who reveals blowsiness and stressful singing which may be traceable to Verrett who is unrelentingly aggressive and unmusical. On that occasion in Milan, Caballe apparently scolded Verrett (as she deserved for her coarse singing) and thus this recording is a failure. Fortunately (on the same label) is a far superior Caballe Maria Stuarda with Carreras as Leicester, no less, and a far more cogent Elizabeth."
1,Junk,Product worked only two months. Would not recommend buying this product.I only put 1 star because it wouldn't let me put 0 or a negative number.
2,Smaller than it looks in the photo,"I was disappointed with how small this was; I just wanted a large calculator with large keys so I can casually tap out numbers when doing my bills. I have an old Sharp Elsimate EL-334F that is just perfect. I was hoping this one was the same size, but it's not. It's going back."
1,MS Golf 2001 Does not work with Windows XP,I was hoping to get this golf program to work with Windows XP. Unfortunately it does not work. Could not even install it.
4,Great songs,Enjoyed the CD and so did my First Communion children. Though I find the recording a little soft.
5,childrens' worship cd,"prompt shipping, great packaging- but i can't comment on the cd itself as it was a gift to someone else...so i never heard it. sorry !"
2,Poor Bettina,"From a person that LOVES Danielle Steel, I thought this book was a little on the bad side. Bettina believes every guy when he says ""I love you"" and marries him. It is definitely a lesson for young women, not to believe every guy. Overall a good read for young readers."
2,~want more depth~,"This is my first book by Danielle Steel, and while I see why she is such a famous writer (the story many women can easily relate to; beautiful descriptions; a light profound moral at the end) this book left me wanting for a deeper insight into Bettina's mind and heart, her relation to the world around, her newly-found strength. The accidental marriages she had underline just how insecure she was, and it's a great mirror for many ladies who are on the edge of saying YES! when deep in their hearts they feel that there is something wrong with doing it. Altogether, a nice entertainment read for a long flight: read it on the Moscow-Shanghai plane, in about 10 hours. Fell asleep three times :)Victoria Evangelina"
1,Not Loving the Kindle version,"I reread this after about 30 years. The first time was in high school. This book was as cheesy as I remember but in a nostalgic way. However, the transcription for Kindle is HORRENDOUS!! I do not exaggerate. I would love to know who the editor was on this piece of material - perhaps I could have his job. My fifth grade child could do a better job - easily. I have never seen so many errors in one piece of writing in all my life and I used to edit college freshman composition papers as a teaching assistant! Who okays these things for mass market anyway Kindle, Amazon or the book publisher? Shame on whoever it is. Don't purchase if typos on every page will bother you."
3,pretty good,"Hard to review since some parts of the books are much better than others. Unlike most romances Bettina had 4 husbands in this book. Some husbands were wonderful and some were sooo horrible- I recommend skimming these parts. Bettina was a wonderful and interesting character, and I also really liked Ivo. Ivo was ironically, her first husband, and I think the best. If the book ended before her marriage to Ivo did, and was turned into a short story, than the short story would have gotten 5 stars from me."
4,let it grow on you,"i bought this cd for 5 bones used. i read the review here before buying also. the first spin of this album was not a good spin, after experiencing their last album. so after the first spin i let it sit in its case for awhile. then one day i tried to give it another chance. i still really couldn't grasp it, so i kept trying. eventually, it grew on me. there is so many elements in this cd. its a real big step compared to their last cd. the songs have the heavy distorted guitars like the last album, but more than that. the vocals are diffferent, at first kind of annoying. but, it will grow on you. just give it a few spins. i'm surprised this album never got attention, little long their last album. try it out......."
5,NO COMPRE ESTE DISCO!,"Esta misma EXTRAORDINARIA versión de Sawallisch, ya esta disponible en Phillips, búsquela, puesto que en este sello la calidad de sonido no es bueno. CÓMPRELA EN PHILLIPS. A mi gusto la mejor versión del Holandés de Richard Wagner."
2,You get what you paid for,"This is a very nice recording but is very poorly documented and it should not be your only Hollander. It has no libretto (as usual with Opera d'Oro) and the tracks are not even fully identified. Moreover they do not correspond to the usual division which further complicates things. If you already own another version of this opera and want to sample different performances this is a good complement, given the price. Otherwise avoid it."
1,Terrible,One of the injectors (out of the 4 shipped) was bad!.Replaced 4 injectors on my daughters Celica and car ran worse. Took it to Toyota and they had to replace #2 injector because it was bad.You get what you pay for I guess!
3,Doesn't work with Polar s720i,"I could never get it to work with my s720i. It connected to Vista Premium just fine, but no communication could be established with my wrist unit."
5,Works Great with XP sp2,I just plugged it in and it worked. No driver installation required. I use it with my Palm Tungsten E2 and Polar RS800SD without any problems.
5,Fast Shipping - Great Product,The product worked as advertised. Great Price and Great Product. The Startech USB21R USB IrDA Mini Adaptor shipped out quickly.
3,Hard to get an undamaged product,"I would not recommend buying this desk because the odds of getting one that is not damaged is low. I ordered on 9/2 and the desk arrived with a crushed edge on the top. After sending pictures of the damage, it was reordered. I sent an email saying that I would have to have the product by 10/15 or I would no longer be at the address where it was being sent (a summer home). Every couple weeks I would send an email asking what the status was. Eventually I found out that the replacement desk also was damaged and a 3rd one was being ordered. They had not told me about the 2nd one until after a 3rd had been ordered. The new desktop arrived on 11/1 and, of course, I was no longer living there so I had to drive over 200 mi. to get it. I put the desk together and am satisfied with it except for the fact that it was described as ""dirty oak"", but is actually a bright red/orange which I sure wouldn't describe as a ""dirty"" color."
1,What for a bad import CD,"On this CD the Tracks are in a bad Quality from the sound , the Orginal Soundtrack from the Movi is 100% better as this import CD. I'ts like a LP from the sound and not a cd."
2,Too Thin,"Nice looking card but the paper is too thin -- do not ""feel"" right. When you to hand one to a client they will think the thin card stock has a cheap feel."
1,Waste of Time and Gallons of Ink!!,"I now have tried for the SECOND time to try to make this product work with their ""DesignPro"" program. Is is far from intuitive and it literally took me hours to finally prepare my cards for printing. Then the fun REALLY began! They give you a ""template"" to use to line up your printing, except they DON'T tell you that the alignment will change when you finally put in the product and hit ""Print"". The first go round I wasted many sheets and gallons of expensive Canon ink to finally get some usable cards. I STILL had to recut them them with my ""chopper"" cutter to clip away white edges. Now, after this second try, I feel better because I have dumped all of the wasted sheets and remaining product in to my recycle bin. Never again!! I'll either find a product that actually works, or I'll have my cards done by someone else. It would be much less expensive than wasting my time and ink with this product."
2,So-So,"The printing and online templates are easy and fast, but overall I cannot endorse this product because they are just too flimsy. They are about to the thickness of a professional card, and it really shows. Also, the perforations are not as flawless as others have reported, and of course I bent them as gently as I was instructed. You can purchase professionally printed cards for about $15-20 + shipping, sometimes cheaper... you decide if it's worth it."
2,Nowhere Near Professional,"Just picked up a $13 pack of these at Office Depot. I was hesitant to get them because I worried that the final product would be lacking, but I figured between the price of the product and the quality of my printer, I couldn't go too wrong. Well, my initial instinct was right. I used Avery's online card designer along with this paper and lost three sheets because it kept printing my design over the margins. When I finally did get it to print correctly, I was very disappointed with the card's feel. The package boasts ""extra sturdy,"" but it just doesn't feel like a quality cardstock and the edges, although not a disaster, aren't perfectly clean. My conclusion is that for most professional purposes, this card lacks the kinds of authority you'd want. Definitely wouldn't feel comfortable handing it to a client. Two stars because I can see it working just fine as a social card (not a business card), and I appreciate the effort on Avery's part for providing simple-to-use software."
4,Good Product,Good Product.This product is suitable to use for printing business cards. My concern is not clear how to place it in the printer
4,Description isn't detailed enough.,"I was not able to use this battery and had to return it. The specifications do not indicate the max charging current, or quickest charge time. When I received the battery, on the side it said 4hour quick charge max at no more than 60mA. This will not work safely in the Maha PowerEx MH-C490F-DCW Worldwide 9-Volt Battery Charger w/ Car Adapter I have (2 hour, 90mA charger). These specifications are pretty important if you don't want to have batteries explode and possibly burn your house down."
2,Bradbury on qualudes,"I found it difficult to want to finish this collection. I absolutely loved his collection _Quicker_than_the_Eye_, but _Golden_Apples_ has an entirely different feel to it. All the stories have this nostalgic airy utopic tone that makes all the characters unbelievable. It's almost victorian. And all the stories seem to revolve around one single idea, and that's all the story has to it, is that one single idea. My expectations of Bradbury are very high, and this collection didn't meet them."
5,great book!!!,"i read this book so many times by now and i still fall in love with it every time i read a story in it!!!he is really one of the best writers, and this is one of his best books!!buy it and see for youself."
3,totally ok,"I have had these for a while, and they sound just ok. The bass can be turned up so that it can shake the floor or you can turn it totally down. The speakers don't exactly distort at high levels, they just sound weird and the subwoofer get's messed up. I eventually got a program to manage each speakers volume level, so I turned the volume all the way up then turned all the other speakers off except the subwoofer. That's the part they try to hide, you can't hear it while the other speakers are running, but the subwoofer sounds like there's a peice of loose plastic inside, but for the price these are great speakers"
3,Decent,"Good sound for the price. Setup is not as feature rich as other Yamaha 3-piece speaker sets: no on/off button - you turn the dial to do that, and bass adjustment is on the subwoofer which can be awkward to get to. Connector for right satellite is proprietary (like keyboard ps/2 style), so it doesn't work well with another pair of satellites, but that's true for almost any manufacturer nowadays.On the other hand, satellites are small and easy to tuck away and the volume dial is very large which makes volume adjustments easy. A good buy for a family member who doesn't care about sound so much, but likes to crank it up once in awhile for music or a game."
5,Great Speakers,"I spent a long time attempting to find a good pair of speakers. Being a college student, unable to go to the store, I had to rely on reviews for speakers on amazon.com. I found that there were many great reviews for these speakers, yet was still somewhat iffy about purchasing them. Then, I took the plunge... and am happy for it. These speakers put out lots of clear sound, comparable to a very expensive set of speakers. But not. They're a good price for a great set of speakers. I enjoy watching movies on my computer now, with the lovely subwoofer and cute little speakers. I'm glad I bought these high-quality speakers."
1,Cheap and it Shows,"The expression ""you get what you pay for"" definitely applies here. Cheap speakers, awful sound and stupid design. I thought I would upgrade my Altec Lansing speakers that came with my PC 6 years ago- what a mistake. Now I have to pay to ship them back. You live and learn."
2,not as good as I'd hoped....,"I guess I let my expectations of these speakers race ahead of my pocketbook. Yes, they are clear and crisp in the higher range, and yes, the bass is nice and you can get it thumping... but the treble seems tinny and the midrange just plain missing! They lack the depth and ""soul"" I was hoping for. My old ... Labtecs weren't all that bad... !"
4,Exactly what I needed,"These Yamaha speakers are exactly what I needed for my Mac. They deliver crisp sound with solid bass from the subwoofer. The units themselves are small (8""h x 2.5""w for the satellite speakers, 8""h x 7.5"" w for the subwoofer) despite their big sound. The left speaker has a large, easy-to-adjust volume knob under the front grill; the subwoofer control is less accessible on the back. The cables are short, however, keeping the satellites close to the monitor - you might want to get something else if you want to space the satellites a distance from the source. Fortunately, they cause absolutely no distortion to the display.For the price, you really can't go wrong with this speaker set. PC owners will delight in the superior sound coming from their computers."
2,Please Please Please give us the old footage!,"I love James Brown, and this current package is sad. The band is tight and the sound is good, but it's like he walks through the whole show giving brief nods to various songs in his career.He has gotten old, and has lost his vocal power. He does tryto put on a good show, but the magic is gone.I hope someone puts together a nice package of live clips at some point, that shows what this great man was. It really pains me to be writing this, so if you don't want to be disappointed, avoid this one."
5,Mr. Dynamite!!!!,This is Mr. Brown's best video. I happened to be there for the concert and I can tell you he tore the house up!!!. I'm so glad the tape captured the excitement of the live show. This is a must for any J. B. fan! He truly is a legend in his own time!!
2,Disappointing,"I recently saw JB live in Tulsa.. the show was absolutely amazing.This dvd is basically just a terrible, watered down version of the concert I saw..The songs listed on the back cover are a sad trick..Most of them are 10 second high speed [garbage] versions - its disgusting.Better try your luck on some of the Godfather's older stuff.Sorry JB."
5,Great Show!,I have watched this dvd so much with my grandchildren that they now love James Brown and know all the songs. I have always loved his music.
2,A sad disappointment ...,"Well, you win a few and you lose a few. With half the reviewers giving this DVD 5 stars and the other half giving it 2 stars, I knew it would be a bit of a gamble. Don't get me wrong: the DVD looks and sounds terrific but the Godfather of Soul is only there in body but sadly not in spirit. The band cooks, the backup singers and dancers work their butts off but the Hardest Working Man in Showbusiness sleepwalks his way through the show."
2,Not worth the money!,"The quality of the cinematography is great (the reason for two stars instead of one), but the concert isn't up to par. Here is why: the band sounds great and Brown rips them out pretty decently, but the songs are too quick. Don't be impressed by the cool setlist on the back cover, because JB only plays about 30 seconds to a minute of each song before going into the next. THE CONCERT IS ONE BIG MEDLEY! You don't get a full song in the bunch. I am a huge fan of soul and funk (I DJ a top-rated funk radio show), so when I admit that it is bad, is must be REALLY bad!"
2,Jumpy video ruins this DVD,"The bands are great (2 drummers, 2 bass players and 2 guitarists), the video is clear and audio is great, but the direction of the video is horrible. The video constantly jumps back and forth between James, the backup singers, the horn players, at a lighting speed that makes your eyes get tired and you start to feel sick.Also, many of the songs on the DVD are not presented in their entirety. The band starts jamming on one tune only to segue into another tune.If the video direction was done right (keep it simple) then I would rate this DVD as 4 stars. Buy at your own risk!"
2,disappointed!,"Sorry, but all the songs sound the same on this disc! I love ""Living in America"" but the version on this disc fall flat. Keep looking if you want to hear the songs like you remember them from the radio!"
4,Mind-blowing evidence for Conspiracy and hope for the future,"Cater seems to be an genuine and serious scientist, and has compiled mounds of evidence supporting ideas including the Hollow Earth theory, Free Energy, and Faster-than-light travel. Is it true? Does it work? His simple experiments can be easily replicated with a little effort and time. If true, this theory is a revolutionary one, easily outdistancing such theories as Relativity (Einstein) and Evolution (Darwin)."
3,Just ok,"I wanted to love this cd but only ended up liking it marginally. About half the songs have a new-age sound to them, the other half are more like folk songs. The reason I'm giving it 3 stars is primarily the audio quality. Some songs were recorded at really low levels so you have to crank it up then others are really loud. On others the clarity just isn't there. The songs don't really flow together very well in my opinion either. There are some chants, some gospel singing, some bagpipes, some synthesizer, some group songs. Note that this was recorded live so there is clapping between songs too. Sounds like the audience really enjoyed it. Better solstice cds I've found are Beautiful Darkness, Winter Solstice Carols and A Winter Garden."
1,Don't buy it!,Solstice Live! right?!?!This is mostly innocuous then BAM! a jesus myth song about the murderers who justify extermination by their supposed spiritual superiority.Boycott them and their kind!
3,Ok but not amazing,"I thought that this album was going to be a hit but is quite lame, Pinella's work in the Symphony X albums is great but he missed the opportunity to create something unique here.It sounds like the soundtrack for video game. Not a bad album, but far from amazing, a true shame."
4,a very good keyboard cd,Ill make this short and sweet. If u are a real Symphony X fan u should buy this as it is very well worth it. Michael Pinnella is a great piano and keyboard composer. Buy it! You will not be disappointed.
4,Adequate introduction to the Ada language,"This would be one of at least a couple of library references for anyone doing Ada programming. As it concentrates on abstract data types, other references with a broader emphasis will still be needed for general information. Overall, his approach is slightly different than other authors, and that's what makes the book a good addition, in my view."
4,GOT IT IN TIME FOR THE GAME! PERFECT,QUALITY WAS TOP NOTCH. I RECIEVED MY SHIRT IN PLENTY OF TIME FOR THE RUTGER/TEMPLE FOOTBALL GAME. VERY HAPPY WITH FOOTBAL FANATICS
5,YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS FILM!!!,"I can see what all the internet buzz is about, This Indy-drama is a fascinating look into the alternative lifestyle, master/slave relationship and also, in a very dramatic way, raises awareness about the shocking Global Slave Trade Market. THE PET is groundbreaking in that it's the first movie to depict this adult-alternative lifestyle of human Pets. A subtle blend of bondage & m/s is mixed into this beautiful story of how the love/bond between Master & Pet is ultimately their downfall as they encounter international slave traffickers who take advantage of their unique love bond...all this makes for an unforgettable ground-breaking movie experience. This film is beautifully photographed and directed, and is the first film since ""Secretary"" that delves into alternate lifestyle in a truthful way. YOU SHOULD BUY THIS FILM -- IT'S GREAT."
5,it was good,"Ok so i am not some fancy film person, but i know what i like and what i dont. i liked this film. But honestly i have learned the best thing you can do is check it out for yourself. i like it, i think you will to."
1,A Bad Movie,"I looked forward to this movie's release, especially after seeing the trailers. In short, it is terrible in about every way imaginable. You could steer an aircraft carrier through the holes in the plot, and the acting was just awful.Probably worse than the money I wasted on this is the black-eye it gives to BDSM. There is not a character in the film who could not be considered quite insane. This is not even a love story. It's a strange story about bizarre people, all of whom manage to be inept human beings with no moral bearing. All that and it manages to be boring too."
2,shock and awe sales pitch.,"So this was shot on a budget. That does cover why the dailog was choppy on forced in most of the movie. Shallow charactor depth, at best. Piss poor camera use and poor scenes in the vast majorty of the movie. If your thinking of buying this movie, save your money. This movie does not act as guide for the alterative lifestyles, this movie isn't even good enought o be a B rate drama or action flick. Truely this movie is a waste of time. I am sorry that I fell for the shock and awe style sales pitch. Save your money DO NOT BUY."
5,"A REAL SHOCKER, A VERY DIFFERENT KIND OF MOVIE!","This is not your average low budget BDSM movie -- far from it. THE PET is an artistic independent feature that looks into the world of consensual slavery. From the credit crawls, the story appears to be loosely based on at least one real person in Santa Monica California. I thought this could only happen in California -- little did I know -- I went on line in Australia and there are lots of web sites and groups into this kind of strange sexual role-play. The acting is a little stiff occasionally, but it's more than made up for by the incredible cinematography, great music score and shocking situations -- which are all the more mind-blowing when you consider that they are REAL!!!!! [...]ANY ONE INTO THE BIZARRE HAS TO SEE THIS MOVIE!! IT'S WELL WORTH IT."
5,YOU MUST SEE THIS FILM -- IT'S GREAT!!!!!,"Don't take any notice of the idiots who have written bad reviews here. They have an axe to grind because the movie isn't their kind of BDSM. This is a shocking look at the world of consensual slavery the good and the bad of it. The highs and the danger of being someone's personal slave. IT'S A REAL EYE OPENER. Beautifully photographed and the director has really done his research on the lifestyle. I Highly recommend it to anyone who's into alternate lifestyle, the characters are engrossing and the film is mesmerizing."
5,TWO THUMBS UP! --- A SNAP! ---AND A HIGH FIVE!,"An insightful movie that exposes an alternative lifestyle that I am sure many did not know exists. The movie shows how many of us are involved in some form of ""consensual slavery"" that dictates what we do everyday. Many of us are satisfied with that arrangement, the status quo, as long as we have ""no worries,"" as the movie suggests. The fact that the movie does not involve lots of sex and violence allows the above messages to be successfully conveyed to the viewer. Alternative lifestyles exist, more that I know, and perhaps more than you know."
1,"I thought this would be something nice and erotic, instead...","...once I watched the entire movie, I wanted to burn it. It's not what you think it will be, very disappointing and very disturbing, on an emotional, psychological and humanitarian level. The people who do this, (not te actors but the monsters who traffic real human beings) should be all lined up and shot slowly -beginning at the ankles and going up- for all the suffering they bestow for the kidnapped children and young girls. They belong in the pit of Hell. I can't believe human beings are capable of such cruelty. It made me cry. I believe people are good at the core, this is just another thing that which had shaken that belief in my heart."
2,ultimately disappointing,"This started out fairly well and darkly interesting, but the moviemakers kept avoiding going very deep into their premise. The ending felt as if it had been tacked on to deliver a 'message' that would redeem all the previous prurient interest stuff and then left the viewer with an unsatisfying downer conclusion.On the bright side, the photography was pretty good."
3,Interesting,"I may be a bit jaded due to my background in media studies, but the bad acting really gets in the way of the storyline, especially in the first half of the film; the pacing in the first half is also faster than what seems realistic. For those who can overlook the acting, however, this can be a good film indeed. Nonetheless, this is a very thought-provoking film, causing the viewer to consider both why someone would agree to become a ""pet"" and consider the reality of the human slave trade (especially the facts about various countries immediately before the closing credits)."
5,STORYTELLING FROM OUTSIDE OF THE BOX,"I am puzzled by other reviewer's desire to pigeonhole this film into a ""genre"" or ""statement"" about either lifestyle or specifically as the creator's social commentary on current affairs. I found The Pet a fascinating and tender exploration of the transformation of two very different people through the bond and experience of their unique, loving, respectful relationship against the backdrop of already clearly defined and labeled ""alternative lifestyle"" crowd and the tragic, horrifying reality of modern slavery. One must put aside personal expectations of this film presenting yet another version of a BDSM, D/S or human rights call-to-action and instead quietly observe the complex unfolding of a precious, fragile metamorphosis in the midst of adversity which is rare and beautiful to behold. Step outside of the box and into the humanity of this story!"
4,Older Editions Sometimes Better,"Langer's An Encyclopedia of World History, a political history in chronological order, is a standard reference book for anyone interested in history, whether you are a writer, a teacher or a life long student. It first came out in 1940 and the latest edition came out in 1981. The more intelligent history students have used it wisely to prepare for exams.Apart from book collecting, you might be interested in the 3rd edition (1952) book because: (1) You don't want to spend $90 to get the latest CD/ print version; (2) You don't need the historical coverage after 1952; (3) You like the page layout and more portable 1952 edition; (4) You prefer the writing style. Different editions of the same book are not the same even when covering the same country and time period. Check out the entry in various editions under whatever king or queen you choose. You may find you prefer one edition to the other for coverage, explanation and prose style."
2,some almost ghoulish,"Some of the Geddes photos in this book are a bit extreme - almost ghoulish - with babies under stretched sheer fabric - giving a weird, almost preborn appearance to the infant. Most of the photos, though, are beautiful and creative and just what we have come to expect from this photographer. The audio CD by Celine Dion is absolute perfection."
1,Saccharine in the form of a book,"When I first saw the concept for this book presented on a commerical for an Oprah episode I was intrigued. When I actually watched the show and realized that this book is full of photos of Celine Dion holding various newborn babies I was aghast! If the book were a celebration of the amazing miracle of Celine's own child it would be one thing, but this just strikes me as super super tacky. On top of that, the music is over the top and several of the songs are recycled from past recordings. The whole thing smacks to high heaven of trying to leverage your fame for more money, which is bizarre to me coming from someone who is so wealthy! Celine should have stayed home and let her womb host that lonely little embryo they keep talking about instead of wasting her time taking pictures with other peoples babies."
1,The only thing more creepy,than Celine Dion alone is Celine Dion holding babies growing out of cabbages.
5,A beautiful rendition of the miracle of life,"Geddes has put together a beautiful collection of photographs accompanied by the music of Celine Dion. The creativity used in photographing these angelic faces of the babies in various different computer generated poses are often captivating, although also sometimes a bit odd.My previous review on this was removed. The reason, I felt this book celebrates life. That is, it is a pro-life stance and celebration of life. I do wonder how some could look at these tiny faces and decide that being able to end thier lives at a whim is a morally acceptable practice.The songs are typical Celine - good melodies and harmonies but as always a bit sappy too. I really have no idea what the intent of this project is, although I will say it is well done."
3,reviewed,I only reviewed this but did not keep it. It may be something I will want to read later on.
5,Miracle: A Celebration of New Life,The book filled with unbelievable moving pictures of babies and the lovely songs on the CD make this book choice one of my favorites.
5,Vampire Ecstacy,"One of Joe Sarno's masterpeices, a soft porn horror flick that's more than just a T&B fest-a fairly well thought out plot that would keep you interested even if the rarely clad,and frequently misbehaving female cast could not. Brings back fond memories of the 70's!"
3,Not really...,"First, while there is some biting there are no fangs. In other words, no vampires. Lots of nudity and some sexual scenes, but over all I could have gotten more for my money by buying a adult anime or any other vampire movie. True, the woman are pretty and show no problem getting undressed. In fact there is a scene where Marie Forsa is naked and there seems to be no reason for it. The collector's edition has a commentary where we do find out a little about filming in Europe, how they got a real castle, how the crew got along and so on. There is also interviews, but they seem to cover the same ground. Over all I am interested in Marie Forsa and may get some of her other films, she did a total of three, but I would suggest skipping this film. No vampires, not a lot of ecstasy, not really what the cover promised."
2,violated the standard rules of fiction,"I don't usually reveal endings or review books that came out a long timeago, but I wanted to call the author on her ending that I feel violatedthe standard rules of fiction. I'm sorry but the narrator cannot be deadunless the readers knows this already as in The Lovely Bones. Otherwise,it is just a sleazy trick from the author. The writing was snappy and clever throughout, making the shoddy ending way below the quality of the writing inthe rest of the book and even more obnoxious. I literally threw this bookinto the garbage when I finished."
2,"Promising elements, disappointing follow-through","Interesting characters, sexy premise, but underdeveloped, and, well, ultimately unsatisfying. I didn't need a ""happy ending,"" but I felt . . . cheated. I expected something more complex and interesting at least. For something so bloody, it was awfully neat."
3,Like the tag line says,"This book is a relatively involving thriller although i actually think the thriller aspect was written secondly to scenes of the narrator copping off with a 'tuff' New York detective. However this book was entertaining and a good read. The characters, although obliques, remain in the memory and yes it is quite sexy in places. The movie should be good so long as they don't lighten up the dark tone of the novel by having a happy ending perhaps with Malloy and Frannie running through a field of buttercups."
2,"tense, but leaves you cold","Moral ambiguity is great but this is no Maltese Falcon. The mood is right, the writing is taut. But in the end you couldn't care less about what happens to the main character (whose level of detachment and egotism must set some kind of record for the genre.) Worst of all are the author's literary pretensions, quie laughable considering the weak character development. Sexy? Yes. Unfortunately it's as deep as a fishbowl, and as hollow as one."
1,Violent porn,"The only thing worse than violent porn (and by porn I mean gratuitousness for its own sake) is a talented, established writer trying to write down to her audience in what she clearly perceives to be a marginal genre. I'm basing this response on my memory of my experience reading it as opposed to the book itself, which I successfully managed to forget almost as soon as I threw it down."
1,Don't waste your money,"The ending was a huge let down. I saw the movie first. The ending is a lot more satisfying. It's a rare event, but in this case, the movie actually was better than the book - which doesn't say a whole lot.The book is raw. The characters are not likeable. The writing style is choppy.I can say two good things about this book:1) It's short so at least I didn't waste too much of my time reading it.2) I didn't mind too much about Frannie's outcome because I didn't like her.If you feel compelled to read this book, save your $ and borrow it from a friend or the library. Don't say you weren't warned!"
2,Total Let Down of an Ending,The only reason I bought the book was because the movie was pretty bad and lacking in substance. The book is a little more meaty as far as details and character but I had to give this book a 2 for the way it ended!!! I can't believe you can end a book like that and get away with it. It was such a let down.
3,In The Cut,I bought this book because we had rented the movie and the ending in the movie was so disturbing to me.I have to say the ending in the book made more sense. It's just not my kind of book.
2,"Oops, forgot to add a plot!",What a horrible mess this book is. There are some exceptional sections and obviously Moore knows how to put pen to paper. But the overall story is so hollow it put me to sleep three nights in a row. The story spirals around and around with a highly disappointing ending and repetitive erotica.I'm amazed at what ends up on the big screen. Let's hope the screenwriter has some original ideas to add.
1,Thoroughly Unpleasant,"'The Whiteness of the Bones' was one of my favorite books when I read this. I expected gritty and I expected dark eroticism but was chagrined to find a weak plot, an unsympathetic heroine and a nauseating ending. The word 'chum' now fills me with horror...When I finished the book I promptly threw it away rather than keep such bad juju in my house. I was left with a profound sense of disgust and disappointment that such a talented author could spend her time creating something that was, perhaps, technically laudable, but reprehensible on practically every other level."
3,Great writing--plot has problems,I loved Moore's writing and others here have done a great job describing it so I won't try to repeat! The plot is forced at times. The ending is completely forced as are the last 4 lines which made me laugh more than anything. I feel like she just never got the plot to work and then didn't know how to end the story. And the end seemed unnecessarily gory.But the writing is so excellent it carries you through.
3,A Tale of Obsession and Depravity,IN THE CUT is a tale of obsession and depravity and the mood is somber throughout a fast-paced story. The book is well-written but it left me feeling mildly depressed.
4,More than an eroctic thriller,"What makes this novel so special is the sense of doom that you can feel in the very first pages. Erotism and blood have always made an interesting combinition in literature. Moore succeeds in both arousing you and also making you feel very uneasy. Although there are no description, and the character's name mentioned just once, everything is so vivid. The female point of view on sex, the nature of language, along with poetry, are what's best in this novel.I heard that director Jane Campion is currently editing a movie based on that novel, with Meg Ryan starring. The ending has also been changed... That's too bad. Read the book first."
1,thriller? erotica? or else?,"The story is short and bad for an erotica thriller. There aren't enough thrills to really make it a good thriller, and there aren't enough sex to make it a good erotica either. I was hoping the story would get better as I read on, but I was wrong. What a waste of money."
1,In A Word: Sickening!,"I don't think I've ever read a book that disturbed me more than Moore's. It's blatant Grand Guignol, blood and gore and sadism, peopled with characters devoid of humanity with whom it's not possible to empathize. I also feel it is totally anti-woman. The macho detectives' attitude toward women is sick-making, but the ""heroine"" just laps it up, panting to be abused over and over again. She's not the poster child for the woman's movement, that's for sure. The final scene is grotesque, sadistic, bloody, and just plain downright nasty. Nicole Kidman bought this property for a film? I wish her well with it---perhaps she can authorize a complete re-write and wash its mouth out with soap. P.S., it deserves no stars whatsoever."
1,Not worth your $$money,For the first time I believe the movie might turn out to be better than the book. That is assuming they add to the story line... and another ending wouldn't hurt either!
1,"Reluctant to give it one star, but I can't click on zero","Such a boring, pointless story that only an antisocial might find appealing, with an ending that will probably leave you yawning. If you could care any less about the central character, you would be in a coma. Yes, Moore writes well, but so do countless writers who achieve more than she ever comes close to... Trust me, there are books that waste your time, and this one is at the top of the list. Move on."
2,"Elegantly written, erotic trash.","While Susanna Moore's In the Cut could have been a pleasant addition to erotica, it is severely depreciated by the ugly violence. She appears to take some pleasure in language as evidenced by the occasional lists of slang, street language, or argot, but this is primarily an in-your-face piece of trash"
1,horrible,"'In the Cut' was a horrible book. I had read the reviews a while back, and most seemed like they liked the book ...let's just say that I don't quite trust Amazon's rating system anymore. Frannie was just a lonely, pathetic character. In the end, I was extremely mad that I actually payed money for this book."
1,Good for recycling,"I am surprised that this book is considered a National Bestseller. I can only imagine that is because of the sex. Moore seems bent on trying to shock the reader with her graphic, violent, but ultimately sad sex scenes. In this day and age when we are supposed to all be going green, when the ""in thing"" is to recycle and the conservation of natural resources, the best thing would have been to never bother publishing this mess of a book in the first place. Since someone found a reason to publish it, please do the ""in thing"" & recycle it instead of reading it. You'll feel better for it, believe me!"
2,A disappointment,"I really love Susanna Moore's other novels, The Whiteness of Bones, My Old Sweetheart, and Sleeping Beauties. However, this novel was really disturbing to me. I don't know why, maybe because I am used to reading thrillers with happier endings. Susanna Moore still writes well in this novel but I just didn't enjoy it as much as her other novels."
2,Interesting voice,"Telling the story in the first person makes for interesting writing, but the bizarre sexual twists don't seem to fit in with the narrative. I never felt that the narrator was clear in communicating her isolation from feelings (as many reviewers claim she exhibits), nor was I clear in why she decides to take sexual risks knowing they could endanger her. Maybe people really think with their bodies over their minds, but, sorry, if my best friend was killed and I thought my lover was responsible, I'll alert the media and call the FBI! Jarring, not erotic but masochistic, somewhat haunting (due to the conversational tone, mostly), but ultimately unsatisfying and unremarkable. Unless they improve on character and behavioral motivations, the movie should be similar."
2,"empty, pretentious, blatantly commercial","Well, I did finish ""In the Cut,"" but reluctantly, and only to find out what this much-vaunted ""surprise ending"" was. The story failed to engage my interest: the main character (what was her name again?) is a smug, would-be brilliant but hopelessly mediocre NYC single woman who pairs up with a big bad cop, delivered straight from Central Casting. One reasonably good sex scene does not a good thriller make. I found the ending neither sensational nor genre-bending; it struck me as a calculated, completely so-what solution to a not very interesting problem. Steer clear of this one. Read Sue Grafton instead."
2,It Didn't Move,"I'm finally done with it. I started to read it years ago but got bored with it and put it down. Now that I've made it thru it, I can see why I put it down in the first place. Wow. I may not be a qualified critic, but I rate this book poorly for the convoluted style the author uses. That is, cramming so much into a single sentence. Even when she mentions a BLT, she spells it out in total. The conversation doesnt flow. I don't even find the sex scenes/references stimulating. (It didnt move) If you're in need of more negativity in your life, if you'd like someone to widen the rift between males and females, then this book is for you. This book, in a way, combines the schizophrenic plot of On The Road and the sexual jadedness of The Bell Jar. Actually, I think On The Road was better written. The high point was the bit about John Wayne Gacy, the murdering clown guy. That was funny, but sick as well. Also, pinning a murder on a detective--that's cold.Okayyy, I think I'm done."
3,IS THERE A SEQUEL TO KNOW THE ENDING?!,"I read this book, since I have been hearing that my favorite actress Nicole Kidman is going to be starring in the film that is being made from this novel. The book's mystery part of whodunit was somewhat interesting. What i didnt like were all the un-called-for sex scenes. What i just hated with a passion was the ending. If Jane Campion and Nicole Kidman are going to make this into a film, I just hope they get a great screenwriter and a new ending to the film. Overall it was interesting an in unusual way reading this novel, told by a women's point ot view."
1,neither erotic or thrilling...just trash,Having had to read this book for a university seminar I was obliged to finish it otherwise it would have hit the bin long before I reached the end. Moore seems to think that by piling cliche onto cliche and then hanging 'shocking' sex scenes onto an empty plot she can thrill the reader. But she can't. The erotic writing was FAR from erotic and I ended up laughing out loud at the corny situations the characters found themselves. It misses out on a real opportunity to explore the complex and real dangers that women face in an urban environment. Two-dimensional characters and a real sense of laziness about the plot-line combined to make an eminently forgetable experience.
4,"Hemmingway, Tolstoy, et al",Several great literary classics combined in one set with plenty of star power to enjoy!
5,The Arabian Nights by Husain Haddawy,Bought this book for my husband on the recommendation from others on Amazon.com. He is enjoying the book so far.
2,Good translation makes a long confusitng book,"Because I do not speak Arabic and know very little about the culture it was difficult to understand parts of this book. I believe the translator did an excellent job. Reading the history of the story, we find it was often recited for many many years, and wasn't put into print sometime around the fourteenth century. If I was a historian I would definitely want this translation, but as a enjoyment reader I would rather the translator give me more color. That would probably draw criticism from other readers, but leave a more entertaining story. It was entertaining at times and did provide a flavor of what the middle east may of been like, but the stories got drug down in details that tends to drown the book. But stories like these should be read, to expand our social context."
1,Historical inaccuracy at its best,"The whole story of One Thousand and One Nights is Persian and the characters are Persian, including pure Persian names, however its better known as ""Arabian Nights"". This book advocates this inaccurate name and therefore is not a trustworthy source for studying the ""One Thousand and One Nights"".While you are at it write a book on Alexander and call it the ""Turkish Conqueror"" who is a Ninja, historically accurate by your standards."
5,Handcrafted Quality,"They don't make books like they used to - or, so i thought, until i bought this elegant edition of The Arabian nights. Beautifully bound, printed on high-quality paper, with an erudite introduction, and clear, but stylish font, I thought how appropriate for the publisher to release a classic such as The Arabian nights in such a 'classic' style, hearkening back to a time when great care was put into published books.Congratulations on a great edition."
4,Entertaining collection of stories.,"I purchased this book for my wife who is studying fairy tales as one of her specializations for her English degree. This review is my summary of her comments regarding the book after she finished reading it.This review is on the Arabian Nights as translated by Husain Haddawy.My wife is not an expert on the Arabian Nights and this book was in fact the first she has read regarding it. The author makes a good argument that both his text and translation are the most authentic available. My wife felt that the stories were entertaining and full of Arabian flavor. The stories within stories were a very interesting technique, and language clearly came from the oral tradition.These stories were not written for children and contain a great deal of sex, violence, and misogynistic mentality."
3,Old School,"Very 1970's Very mediocre. With that said it was a TRUE old style X-rated and you could do worse by watching Showtime and Cinemax ""porn"".No implants and not much shaving hereIf that is what you are into it was not a waste of time but don't waste your time with the soft directors cut versionThankfully there are two (soft and hard) versions on the disc"
3,Stilll there,"Have not been able to view the entire movie at this time. Therefore I cannot give an honest evaluation. However, Mr Reems is at it again!"
1,some gave it 5 stars--not me,"Actually I wanted to state this flick is as primitive as it could possibly be and considering the time I recall Christina Lindberg who had definite sexual appeal. And here considering there are no plot, no acting, nothing to reflect on real life and, in addition, director has strange primitive ideas about sex, love and how it works in society. Avoid."
1,Not a book at all!!,"I thought I was purchasing a book on Nascar and Jeff Gordon that my 10 year old son could read. Based on the price and that it said it was a paperback, I thought it could possibly be a small, easy to read book. What I received instead were 25 copies of a religious testimony pamplet regarding Jeff Gordon and his relationship with God. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure these are perfect if it's what you want, but it certainly wasn't what I thought I was buying. I can't even return them as they have to be in the original package. Well, I don't have a shrink wrap machine."
2,Memoir of 19th Century Russian Literary and Artistic Circles,"A personal history of late 19th century and early 20th century Russian literary and artistic circles, penned by one who was there and clearly loved every minute of it. Teleshov's wistful style is enjoyable but often fails to dig under the surface of his subjects and of himself. Why? Maybe it was simply due to his personality or maybe the Stalinist chill at the time this was written. Teleshov was rare in that he managed to escape state persecution. Still, this work may have had to suffer for him.Devotees of Russian literature might enjoy A WRITER REMEMBERS, as will any fans of Lionel Britton, the mysterious British novelist and playwright, who translated this memoir along with one other Russian work for his publishers, Hutchinson. His novel HUNGER AND LOVE is much more engaging and unique, though."
4,Great steel jazz guitar,Don't expect Triumph. This is the beginning of Rik's jazz/fusion phase. He's still the best and most versatile guitar player around.
3,"Good , But Could Be Better",The Cd is good but if your not into rock you will not like this. I bought this cd and i do not like rock and i didn't really like this one.
3,Not Bad At All,"I bought this CD out of curiosity since I'm more familiar with Cole's work on TV and in the movies. Considering he wrote, produced, and played nearly all the instruments on the album, I would say he did it his way, and my verdict is it's not bad at all. In my opinion ""All Your Dreams"" is the best song on the CD, although I'm also partial to ""Fallin'"" and ""You Don`t Know"". Good guitar work, especially on ""All Your Dreams"" and the lyrics do give something to think about. I did feel slightly trapped half way through the album, I suppose I expected pleasant diversions such as ""Give Her Love"" from Cole's first album ""Tonite"". The sound on the album was also lacking at times, again, the fact that my ears may be too used to the sharp, carefully mastered, re-mastered, mixed, and at times over remixed sounds of current pop singles. Nevertheless, original, fresh, and a thoughtful album."
5,"It's not just a shocker, its a ballet!","As a recording producer, I've made three recordings of Stravinsky's classic and heard countless others: this, with James DePreist and the Oregon Symphony, is one of the very best. I'm tempted to say that it is the first in a very long time that honors its original status as a ballet. Compelling, powerful and dramatic, it is still balletic in conception. (This may also be said for the recordings made by the man who premiered the work, Pierre Monteux.) The orchestra played splendidly during the sessions and the sound, by my colleague John Eargle, has extraordinary presence and impact. Rush out and buy it!"
5,What a bassoonist!,"This is a welcome addition to the many recordings of Stravinsky's Rite. The sound is rich and mellow, pagan and savage, light, powerful...everything you want from the Rite with perfect clarity on my demanding sound system. What struck me immediately, as a bassoonist with years of playing behind me, was the beauty of sound and coherence of phrasing by Mark Eubanks, the principal bassoonist. I suspect that it may relate to his additional skill as a jazz player that he creates a feeling of complete freedom in the solo passage that opens the Ballet. He takes no unwarranted liberties, but within Stravinsky's explicitly notated structure, he suavely communicates the contemplative mood of the opening bassoon solo. There is no way to detect that this is a very difficult moment for the bassoon. Add this to your collection, especially if you have an interest in the bassoon superbly played in a great setting."
3,Not very bright and don't last very long,"I use these to mark the edges of path during the early evening, and these are pretty well suited for that. I think they give out an attractive light, but they are not bright. They won't light up a path, so don't count on these lighting up objects that people could trip on."
3,Bubble Bubble Toil & Trouble,"These clear vinyl labels are even more susceptible to air-bubbles than the paper labels. I guess my problem isn't so much with the labels as with the Afterburner applicator. Even with paper labels the device seems poorly designed and very prone to bubbling. Another problem is that the CD's often don't line up perfectly centered with the label holes. Again that's the applicator's fault. Unfortunately, Afterburner seems to be the only label in stores right now that prints all the way to the center of the hole. And other applicators don't work with Afterburner labels. If this thing worked correctly you could get a very professional looking result with these clear labels. But until they work out the bugs, just use the paper labels. They're cheaper."
4,Good Network Geek Stuff,"Great book for the Network Administrator. Layed out like the ""for dummies"" series, but doesn't say ""For Dummies"" so you don't have to be embarrassed to have it on your bookshelf at work. It is very simple and easy to read. Each appendix is a Windows 2000 roll-out scenario complete with screen shots of each wizard box. I like this book and I'm sure I'll be referring to it often."
5,Dark Brown Pefection!,"This product is fabulous. Nutmeg is an extremely dark drown, almost black. It is a great color and does absolutely no damage to your hair. It is easy to apply, consistent, and natural. This is definitely the product to choose if you want dark brown hair and great quality at a cheap price. I could not be happier!"
5,Performed as stated and was a Science Fair success,My son bought 2 of these motors to test propulsion in the air vs. the water. He built them into his test product and they both performed superbly. When the project was over he took them out and has been using them in other various hobby's for the past 8 months. Still working well. These little motors are a great educational toy for the mechanically inclined and I'm sure they would perform well for the casual hobbyist.
5,Beautiful picture,"The picture is beautiful, it appears to be simplistic in the drawing, but the artist is very detailed and exacting in the dimentions. A beautiful work of art. One should check out ""FLores de Esperanza"" by Nivia G."
1,Buyer BEWARE,Amazon price and service are great...but **BEWARE** of HyperTech.I purchased one of these and they refused to update the program chip when it became obsoleted by newer on-board computers.They wanted to charge me $250 for an updated chip. I'd try a company that takes better care of their customers.
3,bit wobble,"I've had this machine for a year and am still trying to figure out why all the bits wobble in the chisel so much they generate damaging heat. I've turned just the bits and they all are out of round just enough that to show off center points. I've tried other drill bits and the wobble still exists. Now for the complaint. I've called Grizzly and they want me to remove the chuck but can't tell me how exactly, and see if the motor shaft is damaged from the factory. my complaint is, it's under warranty and I don't want to have to fix anything.For all of you with such great reviews, should there be a screeching wobble no matter how much of the bit extends? Is this normal?A little help would be greatly appreciated.Roy"
5,Excellent Product,"I purchased this machine after receiving orders for several pieces of mission furniture. I grew tired of trying to cut mortises with my router. I have made several hundred mortises in white oak, cherry and white maple. I am very pleased with the machine.Pros:1. Arrived on time and undamaged.2. Setup and adjustment took only a couple of hours.3. Hold down is exceptional. I have had NO racking problems4. Plenty of power, it doesn't even groan a bit on 3/4 inch mortise 2 inches deep in white oak.5. Dual rods work very smooth.6. Easy to adjust handle, I can always set it for best stroke.Cons:1. Fiber board cutting base is a little cheap. I replaced it with solid red oak.2. The supplied chisel bit was so-so. I purchased a set from lee-valley (the ones from Japan) and they work exceptionally well.3. I would like a micro adjustment on the depth control rod.No question I would buy this machine again. Great value."
3,You get what you pay for,"Not bad for the price and I guess it is quite versatile compared to competitive products.The handle fixture has been redesigned, with some real poor engineering. The manual has not been updated. Poor quality from Taiwan, leaving burr marks on threads, screw heads and shafts.The wood work table is actually particle board with imitation wood plastic coating, which rubs off with your nail.The flexibility to do larger pieces and bigger mortices, is offset by additional set up time.Once the machine is set up and tuned, it should give good performance though."
4,Missing parts,"I am happy with the tool that I bought but there are some parts that were supposed to be included in my order and to this day I have not received them. The shipping slip stated that the rest of the items would be shipped at a later date at no added shipping cost but have not received anything more from them. Missing are 2 chisel bushing item #13 and there were supposed to be 3 cutters ,I received only a 1/2 inch cutter. I would not recommend this product as far as the company's honesty is concerned. The product I purchased was a Shop Fox w1671 3/4 HP Heavy-Duty Mortising Machine."
3,Dam Break in Georgia,This book gives an excellent example of what faith in Jesus Christ can bring during the most trying of times. The testimonies given shows how the staff and students at Toccoa Falls College held up during this time.
1,"Because it's Johnny, it hurts","Johnny is my favourite of all time. I can't believe I'd rate anything of his one star but this album is bad. It hurts to hear Johnny wasted with this , I can only assume, vanity project of the song writers."
1,This doesn't even deserve a star,"MUZAK! Just get Johnny Hartman+John Coltrane, but for Gosh sakes don't get this middle of the road pop album of muzak."
1,Perplexed at receiving a blunt knife,"I ordered this knife set after due research. Took a long time to arrive. The larger of the Knives works, the small knife is blunt would not slice a tomato, paper nothing it is useless. I sent an email to the company explaining difficulty. This is what I received back:""Hello Joesphine,As the Australian distributor your enquiry has been forwarded to us.We wish to advise that to achieve a good finish without damage to the knife bybeing incorrectly sharpened, we recommend that you have the knife professionally sharpened.This service can be done via retailers such as King of Knives who have many stores nationally.""NO free voucher to have it sharpened. I will never purchase this product again. and feel very dissatisfied as I fell I have wasted a considerable amount of money. No customer service at all. BUYER BEWARE!!_____"
2,pavel.als@gmail.com,"Have used this mouse for 3 years. A good large size and ergonomic design. Acceptable range and rubber surface is very appealing.Now for the down side receiver is way to big it is interfering with nearest USB port, casing for the receiver is poorly made and easily falls apart(fixed with duct-tape). Mouse often freezes and requires manual reset in addition to being picky with surfaces. And lastly the software does not support X64 bit so 4 way scrolling doesn't work on some computers.(I personally like the modularity of the mice after it broke i was able to take it apart and salvage a receiver without any soldering already with pins connectors, haven't decided how to use laser and wheel tracking yet :)"
4,NOT compatible with Vista!,"I love the feel of this mouse and its responsiveness. But it is not compatible with Vista or Windows 7! Nowhere in the advertisement dos it tell you that. So while it will work as a very basic mouse in Vista, you cannot program the buttons. That's too bad, because it feels wonderful in my big hands!"
2,Scroll wheel makes this mouse annoyingly worthless,"I have been a professional computer programmer for nearly a decade. I inherited one of these that had been used very little.For the most part it is nice (the form factor and the rubber sides in particular), but I can confirm what others have mentioned regarding the scroll wheel. It's behavior is annoyingly inconsistent and makes using this mouse an exercise in frustration. It makes a page jump up and down when attempting to scroll. This is not a quality you want in one of your two primary input devices. I thought it might be a driver issue or low batteries, but reading the reviews here confirmed this device is a shoddy piece of junk destined for the junk bin.I removed the plastic teflon-like feet, put them on my old Logitech, then threw this mouse away."
2,RIGHT CLICK TOO SENSITIVE,"i had one that messed up right away and i endured a wheel that did not control the screen properly for a while.... when i rolled down the screen would go down then up, for example - very annoying. i finally called kensington and they promptly sent another. it works correctly, but i find myself constantly right clicking. so much that i have disabled right click. it is a good mouse but the design causes my hand to tilt up and then causing my right finger to lay on the right click button and the button is so sensitive, i click. now that's annoying also. the design sucks - should be redesigned to do more than just look ""cool"" and the buttons need to be stiffened. if you can endure those annoyances then go for it."
2,Not as good as expected,"When I received this mouse, I immediately plugged the USB plug into my laptop and began using the mouse on the arm of my recliner. The laser is super sensitive, and I found I could run the mouse over just about any surface and easily move the pointer around the screen. However, the mouse kept losing it's signal, and I had to repeatedly push the button on it and the USB plug to reconnect. This got old quickly, but was something I could deal with, because I was tired of using the touchpad on my laptop. Soon after that, though, I stopped being able to sync the mouse to the plug, and the mouse became useless. Now, I'm back to using the touchpad, and I'll probably just wait until I get a laptop with Bluetooth to try to go with a wireless mouse again. Overall, very good product when it works, which is not often, and not for long."
1,Makes me think fondly of my old dirty pre-optical mouse,Easily as jumpy and inaccurate as the dirty mice of yesteryear. I bought this one because it was slightly cheaper than it's Microsoft counterpart. Big mistake.
2,Not so hot for desktops,"The mouse worked great (and feels great) at first, but quickly started glitching and locking up. After a bit of experimenting the problem seems to be that the mouse has to be less than a foot or so from the USB transmitter to work reliably. Not a problem for laptops, but my desktop is on the floor and the mouse is unusable."
5,Nice mouse,I received this mouse as a gift. I've had no problems with it as the other reviewers have had. It feels good in my hands and the plug play feature is nice. I wanted a new mouse that wasn't a laptop mouse as they are too small and very hard on my hands. I just wish the receiver would snap in.
5,Good mouse nice feel (shape) responsive,"This top part of the review was added 6 months after I started using the Kensington mouse. The scroll wheel just about stopped working and is now useless in that feature. I just purchased a Logitech VX Revolution to replace it Wow it puts the Kensington to shame.The Kensington Pilot mouse rating I now ive 3 stars reduced from 5 but I can't change the star rating.Original review:Having used this mouse for about 2 months I'm very satisfied with it. Having read the reviews I was concerned when i purchased it. To me this is so much better then an Apple's wireless mighty mouse ergonomically and the best I have used so far. From the poor reviews there may be quality issues, but I have experienced none and am very satisfied with it. I have used 2 other optical mouse's by Logitech and this laser mouse by Kensington is excellent and at least as good or better."
1,Horrible scroll wheel,"Like others have mentioned, the scroll wheel on this mouse does not function properly, even when you install the Kensington software and even with a fresh set of batteries, and even when the USB receiver is right next to the mouse. The scroll wheel does not move up and down incrementally but jumps randomly or not at all. It is horrible.Otherwise, this would have been a great mouse since is the pointing and clicking works fine and the rubberized sides make it very comfortable."
2,Glitchy and inconsistent at best,"I have to agree with the other negative reviews. I just purchased this at BestBuy for a good deal and have always been please with Kensington until this POS. For starters, the responsiveness is very fickle - sometimes you click on something and it opens - other times you can click away and it's as if the mouse has died...nothing. It has a tendency to be jumpy too. I have tried changing the settings every which way but still no luck in how this mouse handles. I am not a gamer, I just use this for everyday browsing and computing purposes and so far, I am extremely disappointed in this. I am considering taking it back as previous wirelss mice have never given me so much trouble. Yes, it's pretty. Yes, it's laser and feels nice in your hand but who cares when you feel like throwing it threw a window every day!"
1,Avoid buying it,"I thought that this product could not be as bad as the other reviews made it out to be - but I was really mistaken. This mouse worked properly only for 1 hour after I started using it. After that it started getting ""stuck"" until the cursor hardly moved. I bought it as I had got a very good deal on it (not from amazon) - but am returning it right away."
3,"Works great on every surface, BUT","I was really impressed with the quality and comfort of this mouse. The contours seem to fit my hand perfectly, however the scroll ball is very annoying. In fact, the reason I was on here reading reviews was to see if anyone had the same problem with their mouse so I could know if mine was just defective. It appears this is a common problem with this type of mouse. However, this problem didn't happen right out of the box. The scroll worked initially for about a month and has done that crazy up and down motion when you roll it ever since. New batteries don't seem to fix the problem."
2,Ack,"The mouse is very comfortable; I really like the rubber grips as I tend to pick up my mouse constantly to reposition it and the like. The tracking is excellent on pretty much any surface, as you'd expect from a laser mouse. The battery life is adequate (about a month or two for me with standard AAs) and you can extend it by switching the mouse to off while not in use.The scroll wheel is horrible; it doesn't handle a single ""click"" properly, so in games like Quake 4 it becomes a nightmare for switching weapons. Finally, the mouse just died on me. I still need to test it out on another machine to verify it's not something else, but the mouse doesn't move a wink or respond to clicks anymore."
5,Among my album favorites,"I love this album. I have had it for years in record form. But the record is old, and I wanted a new copy in CD form. It is soothing, relaxing, and in some cases inspirational. Bud was a great musician.Bonnie R. Baird (Crabb)"
1,"Buyer, beware!","I have been using the CD Stomper Pro for several years and have been very pleased with the results. BUT, when I needed refill labels, out of habit, I grabbed the familiar purple package with ""CD Stomper"" written on it without looking closely enough to realize that these weren't the labels I was used to using.These weren't the peel-off labels that I used with my CD Stomper Pro; these had perferations in the center and perferated tabs on the edges. ""Fine,"" I thought, ""I'll just use these."" Ugh... they ripped, they tore, they were garbage. I lost count of how many labels I ended up wasting.Please, people, don't make the same mistake I did. If you see the little icon in the lower left side that shows the Stomper with a label with the tabs on the edges, stop, drop the package, and find some other labels pronto. I don't know if these things replaced the labels I used before or if they are just a cheaper product line. Either way, they're garbage and should be avoided at all costs."
1,Why did Avery make this product much worse?,"I was happy using CD Stomper several years ago. After reading several negative reviews, I was wondering about this newer product, but I ordered one to try out. Unfortunately, I have to agree with the negative reviewers. Because of the unnecessary tabs, the sheet jams all the time. I use Canon Pixma MP150. This printer has no problem with the previous product or any other papers. This newer product is thinner, so it is very difficult to tear off. I really don't understand why Avery made this wonderful product much worse. I will never use this product again."
4,CD labels,Inexpensive labels for CDs. Not as easy to use as Memorex but does do a nice job. Some of the labels do come loose so you must be aware of that.
1,cheap paper,"The manufacturer added little ""tabs"" because these labels are so thin that they tear when you try to remove them from the backing. The tabs don't help much and they don't tear cleanly from the label. A solution to a problem that creates yet another problem. The best solution would be to purchase another brand."
2,Avery matte CD labels,"Although these labels were functional, I was disappointed as the paper is far thinner than for similar labels I had purchased previously, and these tended to tear easily."
5,Quantity for good price,I am very pleased with the Brother P-Tough QL-500. The printing lables are a good price for the quantity you get.
3,Heaven and Hell,"It's really funny to sell two movies so different just for the same main actor. If we have to say, Don Juan de Marco it's a wonderfull film, the story it's romantic but at the same time a clever exploration about the true love.The other film it's just a waste of time, it remind me much of the old films with much suspense but without a good story and not even entertaining, you cannot compare a masterpiece like ""Don Juan de Marco""with a piece of trash like ""The astronaut's wife"" where boring it's not a choice; next time the best choice could be ""the Ninth gate"" a suspense film with a really clever story."
4,Excellent Thrash DVD!!!!,I was waiting for this DVD since a year ago!!! Excellent concert and the extras are great!! I recommend this dvd for any Thrash metal fan!!! \mm/
5,April knows how to cast a Spell.........,"This cd is great. Every single song is a hit. A definite album for any collection. Personally, I don't know anyone who didn't like this album after hearing it. I'd pay twice as much for it. Check out ""Everlasting""; great tune."
5,"Very rare vintage ""UNDERGROUND"" Freestyle music!!!","If u want to hear Freestyle at it's PRIME....get a hold of this cd or cassette...April's music was at it's prime of freestyle ....""someone to hold"" instant CLASSIC Freestyle....""Foreverlasting"".....awsome song...brings you back to creative freestyle music....If you ever get your handson this album....don't let it go....its very hard to find!!!"
2,ehhh.....uninteresting,"I was pretty dissapointed with this book. All the ""inside information"" has been pretty much common knowledge. Although ""taking sides"" is pretty much a natural in doing Beatles books, the author seems particularly anti Paul/Linda. It seemed to me the author's main interest wasn't even the Beatles, but Hare Krishna.I'd suggest ""Magical Mystery Tours, My Life With the Beatles"" by Tony Bramwell. It was a much more detailed and enjoyable read."
1,Giuliano Not Impressive,"The product review provided me with enough information to know this book is not thoroughly researched. Most every Beatles fan knows it was Paul who played drums on Back in the USSR, not John. In fact, there is no record of John playing drums on any Beatles record. If this is typical of the ""reseach"" that was done, stay away."
5,Fun songs for adults and kids alike,"Sue Ribaudo offers a variety of songs that get kids and adults clapping and singing along. Lovely lullabies and catchy rhythems make this perfect for home, car, or school. I've enjoyed it greatly."
5,Easy to bake in the cake!,"This is a well made file, useful for filing guitar frets and iron bars. Also, not as oily as some tools, so Cousin Jessie can eat the cake without getting that weird taste in his mouth. We hope to see him in a couple of months, if all goes well."
3,Rather expensive,"Came in a huge box. File works as it should, but the cost of shipping kills the deal here."
3,Charming,"This book had a great storyline to it, but at some points, I could tell it was a book based on a movie and not pre-written. The love story was fabulous and the ending not so great."
1,Choppy!,"I have never disliked a book as much as I did this one. This book was choppy, random, and too much like a movie! It left no room for imagination and I probably could have fallen asleep at many parts. There was nothing about this book that made you excited to pick it up again! Do not waste your time! I would say see the movie, but it wasn't much better!"
1,Singapore Story or selective vision: Lee and the truth,"Lee Kuan Yew, the doyen of the People's Action Party, and well known opponent of democratic values in the Asia Pacific has again attempted reformulate history according to whims of the moment. On a personal level, for example, his own account of his family history is amazingly in contrast to other reputable sources. His own account of his familial background is amazingly contradicts his own Peranakan (Chinese/Malay) background. This is obviously a politically calculated move on his part. Firstly, he is obviously rather embarrassed about his own familial background ie. being part Malay. Secondly, his recent push to Sinofy Singapore and especially it's perception of itself can be seen as another attempt on his part to mould SIngapore into his own image. On the whole the book is not necessarily an accurate of history but a good indication of the personal hangups of Mr Lee Kuan Yew."
4,excellent view of the birth of modern Singapore,"I borrowed this book from a Chinese friend from Singapore. She commented ""Perhaps you will understand me better after you read this."" I thought that was strange at the time but she was right. My knowledge of Singapore is limited at best and I loved this book. I enjoyed reading about events from Lee Kuan-Yew's perspective. I was wishing for comments from the opposition just to be able to compare their realities. I admire his vision and determination. No matter how you feel about his views, you have to admire him for actions and commitments to his people. A good read."
4,Good product!,"This product is definitely a nice bargain for the price! You get more games than you could wish for, with much game diversity. The only drawback I saw is a lot of them are ""shareware demo"" software, and you can only play them so many times before you have to register and pay for it or it won't work anymore. This is easy to get around with a little work on your part...just unload and reload the given game on your PDA and it restarts the timer."
5,Trixie Belden Rules!!,"The vivid descriptions of the original 15 or so Trixie Belden books make you feel as though you're following right behind Trixie, Honey and the others as they seek out clues, make discoveries, and shiver in dangerous situations. Unlike sleuths in other mystery series, Trixie has just enough faults to be realistic, and is someone you would love to have as a friend. These books should be re-released for today's youth to enjoy. I'm 37 and still read them again and again, having been lucky enough to stumble across a full set of the original, cellophane-covered volumes for $2.00 per book in a used bookstore!!"
1,Underwater Spaghetti Western in Space Theme Music,"Anyone familiar with Basso's work with La Portuaria would not recognize him here. Firstly, the lack of vocals on this album is depressing. I purchased the CD because I love his voice. But the one really decent cut, Lone Star Angel, is predominantly female on the vocals; Basso's backup voice is an afterthought. And that's my second complaint; every song with vocals is in English! The instrumental cuts are all monotonous, gloomy, and again, monotonous. There is a glimmer here and there of a riff that might have been successfully extrapolated into a catchy, kitschy tune, but he misses the spaceship every time. Even the cover of the CD is ridiculous with a Medusa-haired supermodel preparing to resuscitate him with electric paddles on the moon's surface. Profania is a truly bizarre foray into what someone told him would be a good crossover genre. I hope he goes back to his Rock en Espanol roots or at the very least his native tongue on his next album."
5,GORGEOUS!,"I bought this for my mother for Christmas. It's sheer, but extremely beautiful with just about anything. Jeans, slacks, a sarri.. so on."
3,Good book for your tackle box,"I bought this 64-page 6""x9"" booklet mainly to keep in my tackle box. It has figures of basic knots. It talks about how and when to set up baits,lures and rigs under various conditions. It also gives techniques when fishing from jetties, banks, inshore, offshore, bridges, canals, etc. It's really handy if you are not having a particularly good fishing day and you want to move or change bait. I would have rated it a 4-star, except that it is a 1992 book, and the information on tackle and rigging is generically informative, but specifically just too old. The techniques info is just fine though. I'd recommend it only as a reference booklet."
4,How and when to fish,"I found the booklet ""Saltwater Fishing..."" very informative for my fishing needs. Thank you"
3,Super Reader,"Automobile industry business leaders are being killed, and it seems there is some Ethiopian styling to this, if you can believe the Phantom.Arms being chopped off, dragged through streets on chariots. Ambulances and fire engines, being a big US city.An actual Ethiopian-American plot it turns out to be, some would be arms dealers.I believe it was the Batman that said criminals are a superstitious and cowardly lot. The head guy here sure is.""Oh, you were clever, Phantom! ... You who are thought so superhuman will die like any other mortal!""""Now listen, men!"" the voice ordered. ""You know how this room is built. It's a fortress--even tear gas can't get in! Let them attack! We can mow them down like dogs! We can still win! I'm going to leave. You're to cover me!"""
2,DISSAPOINTING,"GRINDS SLOWLY, BUT WHAT BURNS MORE IS THE PRICE FIXING OF THE COMPANY ANDTHEIR WORTHLESS SUPPORT."
3,for the price its great,"I have been using this grinder pretty heavily for a couple of years now and it has held up well. There are some annoying things about it: I have to grind 2x to the the fineness that I want, I had to tape a magnet to it to get it to turn on, it is extremely loud (i use ear protection,) the snap on bag is kind of annoying. All in all I think this is a great deal despite the annoyances. Someday I may cough up the money and get a wisper mill or something that is quieter and doesn't need to grind 2x."
2,Does not match the high quality of champion base unit,i should first say i LOVE my champion juicer - in a class by itselfhowever the mill is terriblefirst problem is that this grinder is very slow - i can out grind it with my back to basics hand mill (a very nice and economical manual mill)second major problem is that is heats up instantly and is way too hot for a mill (reduces the flour quality)third problem is nearly zero adjustment for finenessall in all a total waste of money
5,Works Great,This grain grinder attachment is a fantastic deal. It works great. Much better than other grinders I have tried.
5,NIce product,Adjustable allows for varying bird sizes. My bird doesn't mind at all once it's on. Does try to bite at clips which can be snapped by larger beaks.
2,Look somewhere else,good size and comfortable material. The bag started leaking after only a few uses. There are no holes in the bag but the material oozes fluid. If you don't mind a soaked shirt or want to cover this with a towel it would be fine for you.
1,Bad Bag,"I owned a similar looking bag for years, then it sprung a leak. This bag looks the same, but is of inferior quality. Within seconds of my first use, the bag either leaked or the bag has a sweating issue.I had to go back to NY (I'm from CA) while on a business trip to purchase a replacement ice bag from Duane Reade drugstore. The Duane Reade ice bag works fine, just like my old ice bag. I threw away the one I purchased from Amazon.I would give this bag zero stars if possible."
5,It's Great,Much better than the herb filled fabric bags that stay in the freezer. This gets colder and stays cold much longer. If chill is too much place a towel between to lessen.
3,Developed a leak,"This product worked great until it spring a leak somewhere... during the summer I didn't mind ice cold water running down my back so much, but come the colder weather I had to throw it out."
2,Dry Rott,"I bought this a year and a half ago, and maybe used it a handful of times withwarm water or ice, and always let it airdry.Worked well and kept a good seal. Last month I got it out again after not having used it since the winter, and the inside of the bag had completely disintegrated, almost like a dry rott. Very disappointed since I really liked them."
1,NO DELIVERY........NO STARS,"I only rated one star because I can't give NO STARS..Ordered on 13th of December with 2 day free shipping from Amazon Prime. They pulled the old ""bait and switch""....created a shipping label so it's ""SHIPPED"" but it's not yet in transit. I can't return it because I don't have it....can't cancel it because it's theoretically already shipped because a shipping label has been created.This was a stocking stuffer gift for my 75 year old Mom who uses an icepack every morning on her neck. Amazon....how do I get in touch with you when it's too late to cancel but too early to return? I have absolutely no info on when, if, when this"
4,Looks good,"I bought it as a theatrical prop, to establish that a character was hungover. It made a very good prop - people laughed. Whether it actually works to relieve headaches, I can't say."
4,They are great,I did not read that they came in different sizes so I was glad that I had picked the large bag. These are hard to come by and every household needs one. They are great. It works way better than zip lock baggies.
3,"Good Bag, Small Cap","This is a good quality standard ice bag however the cap is quite small so if you hold it under the ice dispenser in the door of the fridge you will not find it satisfactory. I prefer the ones by Body Glove or Pro Therapy. The opening on those is about 3"" and makes for easy filling and emptying."
2,Good at first,I bought two and really liked them in the beginning but if you use them much they start to leak - not good!
2,Not as good as the old ones I had.,"I like the design of this ice cap, but it is no where the quality of the ones made years ago despite looking very similar. My main complaint is the excessive sweating of the ice cap."
2,"6 inches? No, a Barbie-sized ice bag","This thing would not be 6 inches in diameter if you stretched it on a rack for a week. And once you put ice in it is about the diameter of a doughnut. Maybe English measurements are different ;-). It is mislabeled; get a larger one.On the plus side, it does get cold enough and is not leaking or condensing all over the place. We shall see whether it stands the test of time."
1,Bad Quality - Don't Get It,"I had a pass-me-down ice bag from my parents that lasted an amazing 50 years. These new ones are of the poorest quality imaginable. Made in China & lined with some sort of plastic, they just don't last. The first lasted about 2 months, the second only 12 hours! Now how hard can it be to coat a fabric with a durable rubber material? Evidently our high tech society isn't necessarily more advanced than that of our parents! Take a good look at the picture of the bag & stay away from all with the white fabric with navy blue snow flakes & dots. They're all made by the same factory. Junk."
5,Great for your SORE back!!!,"I bought 2 of these 9"" ice bags.. One for the office and one at home. THEY ARE GREAT!!! Every time my lower back feels sore and tight, I pop some ice into the bag and it goes straight on my back... In less than a minute the bag is cold and the tension deep in my back is relieved. This works so much better than those reusable freezer bags because 1) they don't get as cold as these bags and 2) it takes time for them to get cold in the first place. I guess they have their own purpose though.... VERY SATISFIED!!!!The screw on lids are nice and solid.. no leaks once the ice has melted. Also getting the ice into the bag itself is a snap..."
1,Not as big as you think,"These caps only have a 6"" diameter if you lay them out flat. Fill them with ice and water and you would be lucky to cover enough area to ice an elbow. If you plan on doing anything like icing your knees go for at least the 9"" pack maybe even the 12"". But once they are filled the gasket does a nice job of making sure it doesn't leak."
5,GREAT LITTLE ICE BAG,I have been looking everywhere for a small ice bag. I finally found one on Amazon. The small one is perfect for small areas. It has a cloth exterier and the lid fits on well. Would recommend.
1,Leaks!,"My parents had one of these that lasted for decades, so I was very excited to find them here. I bought one in the hope that we could use it to replace the gel cold packs that we currently have in the freezer. Unfortunately, the ice cap didn't last as long as the blue gel packs usually do. In fact, it didn't make it a full two months before it started leaking around the top. I believe we'd only used it two or three times. Very disappointing."
1,A piece of junk,"This has some cheap ""fabric"" covering a cheap layer of plastic; mine lasted two weeks before it starting leaking through a small hole. I've had an old fashioned blue heavy duty plastic one for about 15 years with no problems, but this 'new' design and construction didn't last. I recommend the old kind.Ice Bag Large 11"""
4,a bit too small,It measures 6 inch when you make it all the way flat. I should've bought bigger one but it's right size for the baby or small bruise I guess. sturdy good stuff. I might buy bigger one later. I recommend you buy bigger one if you are thinking about adult head and knees.
2,Leaks,"The item was delivered to my home quickly, but the Ice cap leaks out of the top. The lid is not very tight, so I was unhappy to find that water leaks out with ever use"
1,LEAKING,leaking when I first used it. I am very disappointed at its performance. couldn't use it when the hot water keep leaking out.
1,Leaks like crazy!!!,"I bought the 11"" bag and was so excited to get this bag for my knee. But the 1st time I used it, water was everywhere. I thought maybe I didn't screw the cap on tight enough or maybe when filling it up with water, it got on the side of the bag. Nope... the same thing happened the second time I used it. Water running down my leg, on my blanket and the pillow I had my leg propped up on was soaked. I am going to return it and get a different bag from another company."
5,"Oh, my aching...!","Got both the 9"" and the 11"" too. They're nice and sturdy, and cheap too! I'd recommend these over the thin rubber varieties every time."
4,"Love this ice bag, but it isn't perfect....","I have all three sizes in this style ice bag. I have the 9"" and 11"" in this style, and the 7"" in the Blue No. 7 style. The No. 7 style is easily of higher quality and better made.I use these bags for frequent migraines, the 9"" size is my go to size. It sees the most frequent use, weekly, somtimes daily. I purchased one 9 months ago, and it has already begun to leak around either the seal on the lid, or the around metal seal at the top of the bag. My last 9"" bag leaked at the seal on the lid, though I couldn't see any discernable damage. My other 9"" bag (yes, I have two), purchased 2 years ago, is still going strong. Perhaps the problem is inconsistent quality?However, I so prefer this design over the Mueller design, which failed even earlier, sweats MUCH more, and didn't retain the ice as long.I'll continue to purchase this design until I find a better design."
3,Avery White Shipping Labels: LASER PRINTERS,"These seem to work the same as other shipping labels so I'm not quite sure of the benefit of ""TrueBlock(TM)"" technology. It's a label, right?! It works fine, but only 3 stars since I didn't really get what the new technology was supposed to do. I wouldn't pay a premium for it. Also take note, these are made for laser printers, not inkjet printers. There is another version of this product made specifically for inkjet printers."
4,Good choice,"These labels are a good size for mailing first-class parcels and larger envelops. Also, they are much better quality than the off-brand labels. I am pleased."
4,They make life easier for shippers!,"As I writer, I am often sending out short story manuscripts to potential markets. I'm a great recycler of envelopes, but I spend far too much time trying to peel and/or scrape off the old labels while trying not to tear into the envelopes. These thick labels (they call it ""TrueBlock Technology"") will go right on top of the old labels and cover them up completely. Works like a charm! They're big enough for long addresses or large fonts, and you can even create logo shipping labels with them."
5,Work Well,"Not much to really say about a label...but they do pull off easily, so what is most important, works well."
5,Great product.,"I won't bore you with a lengthy review, I mean c'mon.. they are shipping labels.They can be printed on by your printer with ease, they stick on super strong, and are of great value. 5 stars!Get these, they work great!"
5,Another great product by Avery,"These labels are of good quality and just what they should be. They print smoothly without jamming up my printer, they provide good coverage for covering up old addresses or other unwanted info and most importantly they STICK! I hate cheap labels that require you to tape the edges down so they don't peel off."
5,Go Avery and you won't go wrong.,"Sure, you can get other label brands but you can't get Avery QUALITY anywhere else. If you want a product that wont peel off when you don't want it to (like in your printer or at the post office) one that gives crisp imaging and conforms to the templates you have with your label program or word processing software, and one that presents well to the recipient, then stick to Avery and you won't be sorry. These labels are a prime example of what I'm talking about. I often reuse large envelopes, mailers, and boxes. These labels go on clean right over the top of the old ones with no see-through to confuse the delivery person. They are also great for sticking over bar codes and routing notes."
4,Good labels.,The labels print perfectly and have a decent level of stickiness. They do not seem like they would fall off at all after adhering them on to the letter. Good stuff. Just the right size to not take up too much space and to get the most for your money. A good amount per package. Avery always seems to make the best quality office supply products so you know you can never go wrong with a product of theirs. Maybe could be a little more sticky but decent.
5,Bueno!,"I love my Acme juicer and these filters make it easier to clean and the juice comes out pulp free. For the best tasting juice available, you need these with your Acme juicer."
3,Worked perfectly but they were NOT branded Acme,If you ever use a filter you will never do without. These filters arrived quickly and worked without flaw but had NO BRANDING on them so I have to suspect they were third party filters.
3,Great sound... But get the upgrade model!!!,This is the second i-Fusion speaker I bought. I loved the first one so much I decided to get a second for my friend as a gift. Unfortunately this model doesn't come with a remote control and my first one did. I would highly recommend this but pay the extra $40 and upgrade to the next model for the remote!!Another minor gripe is the nano adapter is for the old nanos so if you have a new nano the adapter will not fit. You can stil jack your new nano in but it tends to be jiggly and loose.
4,Great Portable Speaker System,"I bought my iFusion at the same time I bought my iPod in 2006. It has come in handy more than I ever imagined. I bring it on ski trips, vacation, office parties, etc. I'm no DJ, so its simple controls aren't really a problem for me. (http://www.ilounge.com/index.php/reviews/entry/sonic-impact-i-fusion-portable-speaker-system-ipod)Pros: Comes with adaptors for many kinds of iPods, big and small; your favorite iPod and adaptor can be carried inside the zipped up speaker case. Charges your iPod while it plays if the system is plugged into an electrical outlet.Cons: New iPod models may not be accommodated by the original adaptor set; power cable doesn't fit inside the zipped up speaker case, which makes packing one (tiny) bit harder."
2,short life,Initially I liked this product. I've owned it 1 1/2 years and it died on me. I'm very disappointed.
5,Great Portable System,"I bought this and I really like it, it sounds great and is very handy. Well worth the bucks spent!"
3,I-Fusion has it's ups and downs,"Mostly I would review this item as a totally wonderful product but it has some down sides. The great thing about it is the durability with the hard case. I use this item for work everyday and never have to worry about it breaking. The sound quality is also very good but not a substitute for a real stereo. Down side is this: The zipper is flimsy. The metal snapped off on the zipper pull leaving only the stub of the zipper after 9 months of use. Also now that i have had it one year, the volume is on the fritz. The buttons do not work to increase or decrease volume and the battery is not to blame. But i would still recommend this product as it served me well for at least a while."
4,Great System!,"I was introduced to this system by a teen and fell in love with the portability and sound and its seamless connectivity. Just great! However, one thing that would make it better is if the power cord fit into the compartment in the unit. As it is now the power cord head is too big to fit, making the cord 'homeless.' Why didn't they think of that??"
1,Was it dance?,"I watched this video about fifteen years ago. As far as I can remember, there was very little dancing, the biggest attraction being the costumes by Pierre Cardin!!!! Maya was already well past her glorious years."
5,Singles of the 90's? Music of the Future,"Ace of Base has done it again. While in the works of album 5, they decided to release Singles of the 90's. More poppy and happy than the US version, it's explosive with euro-beats and cutting edge songs. Contains never heard before songs and time loved remixes. Overall, my favorite Ace of Base album!"
1,not a pressure cooker,"This is a classic case of false advertising. Although the phrase ""pressure cooker"" is used in the name, the product itself has no facility for holding pressure greater than atmospheric. There are no valves, no seals, no pressure regulation mechanism.It is light weight plastic with a minimal attachment device for the lid. There is a simple sliding mechanism for closing the lid, and the cooking instructions tell you to leave it *open* during cooking. You are cooling in a tupperware like container vented to *prevent* pressure build up."
5,Couldn't Manage without It,I've had mine for 15+ years and use it all the time. It finally gave out because it is only flimsy plastic with plastic controls. But it really gives service. I made a 3 pound pot roast yesterday with carrots and onions plus seasoning. It was perfect in 15 minutes. Last week I made 4 large meat and rice stuffed peppers in 20 min and the rice and meat were perfectly done with the peppers soft but not mushy. That's an example of how to use it. Just be careful with hot grease as a base or tomato sauce that can stain. The possibilities are endless. I've just ordered 2 more and expect they will keep going for the next 30 years. Now that's a deal.
5,Simple meat cooker for microwave,Bought this for our grandmother for Christmas. She uses it to cook meet in the microwave and is a big fan.
1,It dosen't do anything that one cannot do with a bowl.,"If it takes the same amount of time to cook pasta in this unit as it does stove top, whats the point?"
1,Locks Broke Within Days,"I cook rice almost everyday. Number 1 issue is that it spills lot of water in the microwave, and number 2: the locks broke within few days...I am greatly disappointed with this purchase. I am still looking out for a nice microwave cooker."
5,Great for microwave cooking,"This is an excellent addition to any kitchen which has a microwave. It is especially great for households which only have a microwave to cook in.The best thing this does is cook rice. The rice turns out the same as in a rice cooker, and not mushy like it sometimes turns out on the stove. (Or maybe that's just my rice.) It works for several varieties of rice, but not for wild rice. We tried cooking wild rice; it didn't even soften, and our micro master melted.This isn't a real pressure cooker; it's more like the microwave equivalent of a dutch oven.Perfect for people who:- Prefer cooking with microwave ovens- Only have a microwave oven- Are sometimes short on time- Are ALWAYS short on time"
1,Not enough info,"Microwave Pressure Cooker - JC2045This is another of my impulse buys which was a mistake.There are no instructions, only two recipes (which aren't enough examples for using the thing), and no manufacturer's label so you can complain.Of course, you probably know where it was made.I'm very disappointed."
1,This Microwave Cooker SUCKS!!,"This Piece of trash is only a good deal if you find it at a 99 cent store, the most its worth is $1.00, save your time and grief, GET A REAL MICROWAVE PRESSURE COOKER!!"
1,Software forces close perpetually,"I bought this product for my photography CDs, while the sticker itself is amazing (I've never used the stomper,it isn't worth it)Design Pro, will force close several times while I am trying to complete a project.It is very aggravating."
3,Makes pretty labels,"It does what it says, it makes pretty labels. Labels fade after a while and begin to bubble up if stored in a car or somewhere hot."
2,"Better than handwriting, but not as good as a printer","I have not been very happy with my CD Stomper. I have a difficult time getting the CDs and labels to line up properly. Often, the label overhangs the edge of the CD a little bit. The perforation around the middle of the labels show whether or not I pop the center out. It usually take me two sheets of labels to get one good label, and I waste two or three CDs. You can not remove the label once it's on there, because it peels the foil off the CD.The labels do look nice and peel off the backing very easily. When it lines up right, the CDs look great.I chose to use another program to create and edit CD labels. The only template Avery has is in Microsoft Word format, and it did not line up right when I printed it. So I made my own template.Overall, I found the CD Stomper to be OK, but I would not choose to purchase this again knowing what I know now. Our CDs looked much better and cost less time and effort when I printed directly on to the CD."
1,Low-quality labels with inexcusable software,The quality of the labels are simply poor; low-grade paper makes them very flimsy. What makes this an even worse package is the software. It does not install properly and keeps prompting you for files. Overall a very bad product. Avoid at all cost!
2,New CD Stomper is TERRIBLE,"I used the original CD Stomper for many, many years and never had one problem. I bought the new version and it's such a huge downgrade. Why do I have to calibrate my printer when I didn't before? Even after you calibrate your printer, the text still is never perfectly on the label, I've wasted so much ink and labels trying to get this stupid thing centered and it never prints perfectly. Oh & the side tabs never rip off cleanly, my cds have to look atleast half-way professional when I send them out to clients, and it doesn't look too good with tear marks on the each side of the label...this product is JUNK.Thanks for ruining a great product guys."
3,Ambivalent,"I used this previously to make labels and covers for my professional CD's I release and it's very user friendly.I am kicking around the idea of buying another because I really need it and this worked better than others I have tried like Nero which won't let me save it to .jpg so I could not send it to the distributor to print, but.....The main drawback was my hard drive I had it loaded onto crashed and then I could not use it again on another machine when I tried to load it. So that pretty much sucks. I got to use it to make one cover and label and then poof.I contacted customer service too and I have to say they are pretty useless and skirted around the issue of it being a one time use."
2,Not Worth It,"Although this item is simple enough to use, it lacks quality. The adhesive on the labels is not sticky enough. I discover this when I burned a music CD and was getting disk error messages on my device. I ejected the disk to find that the label was not sticking on the edges of the disk. No matter how much you press and smooth it out, it continues to raise up. Also, the CD designs are very limited and unimaginative. Don't waste your money."
3,CD Stomper,"Got this to replace an older version. New software is fine. The labels apply slightly off center, which wasn't a problem with the other labels and applicator."
2,Mac software might not work for you,"I find the product is usable on Mac OS 10.1.5It crashes on opening in Mac OS 10.3It has a few bugs, but I am very pleased by my final results.Before purchasing, you should check the support section of their web page and see if they will answer any question you might have, such as, will it work on your system?"
1,DVD Stomper labels,I never received what I had ordered. The vendor tried to use a substitute I guess hoping that I would accept it.
4,"Great Product, Worth The Price!","I bought this product after reading the reviews on this site and I love it, I have terrible hand writing and always hated the way my burned CD's looked. I have to say that this has made my life much easier. The labels always come out just like they show on the program, the program is super easy to use, I sat down and after five minuets I had made my first label designed! the only draw back I have found is that sometimes the labels don't stick exactly on center and there is a slight uncovered spot not enough to interfere with any player just enough to show a little bit of silver on the disc but it doesn't bother me at all. I love this product and recommend it highly!"
4,N.T. Lesson Maker,I have used books like this before. It is helpful in making up the study sheets for my class. I appreciate the way the questions are asked on a given book study
5,Bought it 15 years ago and still love it!!!,I bought this box about 15 years ago in Disney World (Orlando) and still love it so much. Because many of the songs are from movies I watched when I was a teen.
4,Great collection!,"I have this collection on cassette and I plan to buy the CD's. I love this set because it spans the history of Disney's wonderful songbook of music. Where else can you hear the Swamp Fox theme or Sean Connery singing Pretty Irish Girl? I am a total Disney fan and I would recommend this set to anyone who loves Disney or wants to show their kids Disney's amazing history in song. The one drawback is that it does not include the music from the last decade or so...but, that's okay because there are several good Disney CD's out there that do. Ultimate Disney volumes 1-3 actually. I think that is what it is called...Anyway, such a great variety of music here."
4,A must have for Disney Freaks!,"This is by far my favorite of Disney Albums. If I could have designed it I would have made the first disc 100% animation, the second for live action and TV, and the third music from the parks.The only reason that the score isn't higher is because I would have liked to have more music from the parks.That aside, this is a great addition to the CD collection."
2,Not a sing along type,"Not exactly what I expected. Nice for adult rememberance, it is the sound track for most of Disney movies. But, not really to entertain children."
4,"Good, classic card game","Learning to play this game, but having only two players seems to cause a great deal of conflict with the rules. It would be better enjoyed with a larger group of players."
3,Rage Cards,I like playing rage its fun. It's better if you have a lot of people. Any age can play as long as they know numbers and colors.
5,Best card game ever,"I have been playing Rage for about 25 years. My original game is very worn, so I am thrilled it has been re-released (and not in the German version). The original advertising called it ""an adult game of revenge"". Sort of like playing a wild card poker game - at any moment, the trump card can change plus lots more curveballs can be thrown at you. Each round gets one less card, so the tension is constantly building! Great fun, although it is helpful to have someone with decent math skills keep score if you are the least bit competitive."
5,A great familily card game!,I had been looking for this card game for years and was delighted to find it on Amazon! My family was thrilled that I found it as we had lost our deck many years ago. It is a great game!
5,Absolutely Terrifying,"I'm not a ""horror"" movie fan. But I do like a good story, and a good movie. This is not your typical slasher or vampire flick. This is a real film. I can't think of another vampire movie with more terrifying monsters. This is in the veins of great scares like Dawn of the Dead and 28 Days Later. You really fear for the lives of the poor people in this town, and you can't see any way out for them. I especially liked the crescendo of the film from relative calm, to getting a little worried, to several minutes of all-out terror, and then back down again. This is certainly one of best executed horror films I have seen. It's definitely worth the watch if you like the occasional scare, but aren't into the crappy horrors that we are used to hearing about."
4,Worth buying.,"This was one of the better horror movies I've seen in a while.The minor events leading up to the attack on the isolated Alaskan town were spooky, but the seige itself was almost as good as Night of the Living Dead. The movie does a great job of making you feel trapped along with the actors.My only complaint was the vampires. They seemed a little one-dimensional. After two hours of watching them hiss and bare their teeth, they no longer seemed particularly scary."
2,"Boring, no frights to be found here!","I was told this was unconventional and original. And I love vampire films, to a point. The point is when it becomes disbelieving and cliche. Well, this movie crossed all of those. First off, I have a problem with the title. Not only did it not feel like it took place over a span of 30 days, but I didnt even believe it took place within a span of 30 minutes. Honestly, it was quite ridiculous and wouldn't fool anybody watching it. Secondly, the ending was awful, cliche, pridictable and boring. The vampires themselves were quite chilling, the way they looked and appeared out of nowhere, but even that got old. If you scare easily, you may enjoy this, but don't look for much of a plot, whatsoever."
1,Don't even waste your four dollars on the rental,"This has to be one of the worst vampire movies I have ever seen. When I first heard about this movie, the plot sounded like a good idea...a month of darkness-the ideal place for vampires that are looking for an easy meal without the annoying presence of sunlight. Sounded good but the movie was just a fake bloody piece of garbage. I think the acting by the so-called vampires is what finally did me in...all that heavy breathing I thought they were giving birth! Josh Hartnett must have lost a bet."
1,30 days of disappointment,"There's no suspense in this movie. The fighting scences are quick and badly filmed. They're not exciting at all. There are 2 shocking scenes. They're all related to killing with axes. One of them is exceptionally appalling because it involves a child. Besides that, I felt detached while watching this film. I did not care about the characters. The 2 main characters, the sheriff and his estranged wife rarely spoke with each other. The last scene where the sheriff sat with his wife looking at sunrise was supposed to be touching. However, I felt nothing.It's worth watching for curiosity."
3,Where Was The Writer?,"I purchased this disc after seeing the trailer on various other discs. The trailer is better than the film which only has one saving grace - it looks cool.Unfortunately the director and the writer expected the viewer to suspend all forms of logic to get through it which makes watching more than twice nearly impossible. The script/logic holes are canyon sized. Also many of the 'dark' indoor scenes were too 'bright' a missing mental tool that both the writer and director desperately needed.For example why would the sheriff go outside to 'save' the screaming girl surrounded by ravenous vampires with superior strength, only to find a bitten neighbor and kill him? Don't bother to watch this disc if little things like this bother you because there are many more just like this throughout the film."
4,Good horror.,"I haven't read the books, but plan to. I would've liked a different ending, but the movie itself did keep my eyes glued to the screen. When vampires come to a town that's plunged into darkness for thirty days the result is a blood bath! I was wondering why they had to eat so much so fast...must be used to the 'all you can eat buffet'. I love a good horror, among many other genres of films and books, and this wasn't a disappointment. If you're a horror fan and you haven't yet seen 'The Descent', that should also be on your list! I will say that the actor Danny Huston gets my vote for 'creepiest vampire' in the history of modern vampire films! When you add a snowstorm, darkness and isolation to the mix the viewer can't help but feel a 'chill'.Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
5,Best horror of 2007? It just might be...,"In movie land where remakes seem to be the latest fad (don't get me wrong, I enjoy the occassional remake) 30 Days of Night proves to be a great breath of fresh air.In some of my other reviews I have made it known that I am not a vampire fan but this movie might have just changed that.In remote Alaska, closed of for 30 days of darkness lies a perfect place for a vampire to play and feast. The cinema photography was excellent and you can't help but feel cold watching the movie. A pile of cell phones, slaugherted dogs and an enemy that seems impossible to kill makes for a thrilling ride. The sneakiness of the vampires and the intensity of the survivors hiding out is the best!Not once did I get bored with this movie. I was a little concerned about Josh Hartnett carrying the lead role but much to my relief that proved to be a false alarm.If you want a good movie with some certian chills you must check out 30 Days of Night.- Dan."
4,Such a waste of good blood,"I was entertained by this movie, but I had to laugh at some of the scenes from the vampire point of view. The biggest was the feeding. These vamps wasted more blood than they drank. Creepy? Oh Yeah! Great makeup job on all of them, especially the girl who gets burned by the light. A definite nosferatu look. It's worth watching for the fun of it."
4,Great Vampire Movie,"Good movie in theatres. Excellent quality in Blu-Ray. If you like vampire movies and aren't too picky about some authenticity problems, give this movie a try.The head vampire's haircut gives me the creeps!"
2,Blah. What a Boring Movie.,Terrible. Dumb. Boring. I was so bored with this movie. I wish I could have my time back. I got it on Blu-Ray and was still bored. The picture was crisp in HD but the movie it terrible.
3,An ok movie,"If all you want is a ton of blood and gore than you'll probably love this movie. If you want good sunspense and a good story, perhaps not so much. The vampires were pretty scary-looking and you actually care for the characters, though. Not much more I can say. It's not a great movie. Not bad, but not great."
3,"Gory, atmospheric movie, but lacks class","This has some fantastic scenes in it, which work brilliantly, but overall it doesn't work as well as it could have. This is a pity, as what does work is superb, but too much lets it down.Don't get me wrong, this is worth seeing, but could have been so much more.Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys"
3,Another bloody vampire movie,"This kind of movie isn't for those with a weak stomach.In Alaska during winter the sun goes down:in this case the strange thing is that someone wants to makeuse of the dark this year.Will any of the residents of Barrow, the pipeline town survive?The small town sheriff and his wife are the main human charactersand there is a very strange cast of vampires...The acting and script are pretty good for a scare film."
2,It's horrible!!!,I saw this movie but it's not good as i thought. It's mess movie and the sound and views are horrible. This movie is bad.
3,"Good, but I expected more","Overall I liked this movie. Although it had a lot of potential, the one thing I think that could've been done better was the behavior of the vampires. At times it was a little cheesy. Definately worth watching, but maybe not twice."
2,30 Days of Night,"A purely mediocre vampire movie. The action sequences are better than average, the special effects are better than average. The story is very typical, the only standout from a story aspect is that this is the first monster movie I have ever seen where the people that attempt to hide from the monsters are actually successful in hiding from them. The downside to that is that hiding from monsters...not really that entertaining."
3,Pretty Entertaining but not as good as I expected,"Judging by the previews I thought ""30 Days of Night"" would be much scarier then it actually was. Don't get me wrong though because it was enjoyable. I though the dark imagery of a snowy alaskan landscape really added a nice touch with the addition of some really creepy vampires. I defiantely wouldn't want to run into that pack of the undead. I would say the film is worth checking out but may be a litte less then you're expecting."
1,Boring Vampire Movie,"30 Days Of Night has an extremely interesting premise in which an Alaskan town in the midst of winter and 30 days of darkness is besieged by a horde of vampires. That's about the only interesting thing about this film. There is loads of blood and violence, but the plot is thin at best with a ridiculous ending. The acting is marginal too be kind with a very stiff performance from Josh Hartnett. One of the more annoying aspects of the film is that the lead vampire (played by Danny Huston) is the only vampire that ""speaks"" but the language is no more than some clicks and clucks which is subtitled. As some other reviewers have noted, the film doesn't depict the vampires as cultured fashionistas, but it goes the other direction and basically reduces them to a pack of rabid dogs."
5,30 Days of Bights,"This had got to be one of my favorite movies in the horror type. An A+ for the acting. And the action is wonderful ,5 stars for me. And i am a movie fanatic and see just about everything . I have to say this rates up to the top ten...."
2,Eh!,"The blood and viscious kills were awesome. The ""caring"" 1/2 human 1/2 vampire...and the stupid love story (ending) ""killed"" it!"
2,Doesn't make me want to go to Alaska,"I admit I thought this movie was going to be a really great horror story when I picked it up. I was thinking what a terrifying idea it was, a place like Alaska, one of the few places on Earth where there would literally be 30 days of night. There's no where to hide from a vampire!However, this movie failed to pick up steam. We have the standard subplot with the police force who are estranged and headed for divorce court. The town is shutting down as they are prepping for their 30 days of night, something unique to the residents of Alaska. But ... it just didn't fly. Instead it turned depressing real quick."
3,"Fantastic costumes, but a subpar ending","The best thing about this movie was the effects for the vampires. Their appearance was marvelous. They looked really freaky, even up close. Unfortunately the ending of the movie was a letdown (as other people have already mentioned). It seemed hurried and many pieces were either left out or not explained. I had really high hopes for this movie after watching the first half hour, but it never lived up to those expectations. It was still a good movie, but it could have been so much better."
2,"Can you say ""Boring""?","I'm a big vampire fan, so when this came out I was excited. When I actually watched it I was highly disappointed. The teeth of these vampires made them look comical because their lips protruded out. I'm guessing they were speaking Latin, which is fine, but the vampires were more prone to screeching and making odd sounds then actually speaking to each other. Their attitude was more like zombies than vampires, because they acted like complete idiots with no brains. The plot line was too predictable. Halfway through the movie I knew exactly what was going to happen at the end. Really not worth the time it takes to watch."
5,La mejor peli de Vampis? seguramente sí.,"Muy bien rodada, se hace corta de lo intensa que es, espero ansioso la secuela, siempre y cuando no desmerezca a esta. Lo unico malo de la peli, es que se podian aver currado mas la edicion en DVD."
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"I must admit, 30 Days of Night left me pleasantly surprised. I expected little, and while this movie was no masterpiece, it was entertaining and had many good points. The story was fresh, the acting well above average, and the movie was authentically frightening at times.The movie also has some flaws and inconsistencies, namely the fact that the vampires seem to get weaker and slower as the ultimate confrontation draws near.Still, this movie is worth a watch. There is plenty of gore and frights to keep horror fans happy, and plenty of suspense and originality to keep Average Joe or Jane engrossed."
3,not bad for the genre,"I don't generally watch horror films as they are usually quite pointless and most often silly, however, this wasn't a bad Halloween fare. Josh Harnett continues to surpass his pretty boy image, although the fact that he is pretty to look at makes this film a lot more enjoyable than it would've been otherwise. The makeup and the special effects are dead on (pun intended). This is a solid horror film. Not a revolutionary film of its genre, but not one to dismiss either."
5,"Unique, Vicious, Interesting","I enjoyed this film from beginning to end and have watched it many times although normally I have zero interest in vampires as they are clownish and not frightening in the least.What made this film a 5 is the plot's uniqueness in how vampires are portrayed.Unique in that who would have ever thought to bring vampires to Alaska where it stays dark for 30 days. No coffins to be seen (so mundane) and they do not speak English much. These vampires have no interest in communicating with humans. There is also none of that ridiculous male vampire to female woman sexual undertone in this film.These vampires are extremely vicious, quick, cruel, intelligent and secretive. Humans are food-period.The people of Barrow reacted the way any population would-with bravery and insight. They were not going to go down without a fight.The ending was also amazingly unique because no one had ever thought to beat vampires at their own game."
2,Quick cuts= loss of interest,"You know it's too dark, when you lose all sense of the action. Add the quick cuts and you start looking at your watch (if you still wear one). The vampire ""rules"" don't seem to apply. If you kill everyone early in the game, you have nothing to eat tommorow. Lame."
2,"Nothing Special, Not Even Midnight Movie Fare","I saw the film and I was not terribly impressed. It was something to see, sort of a Night of the Living Dead survival horror. Of which there is nothing really scary only gory and gore used with a good horror film is actually more effective than simply used for cheap gasps. Wooden performances. A cheap thrill. Not even camp value. Avoid or wait till dvd. It should be out fairly soon."
1,Not worth it.,"If you love your typical vampire movie then I suppose you'll love this one. But there's nothing new here. The vampires are freaky and there's a lot of blood, but it's the sequence of events that gets in the way.Instead of focusing on how to avoid crazed vampires for 30 days, the movie skips over significant periods of time with no explanation of what happened in between. Not to mention that the vampires had literally 30 days to find the hidden humans in a town where there couldn't have been more than 20 or 30 places to hide. The movie makes the vampires look freaky, but incredibly stupid.Also, Ben Foster plays the exact same character in this movie as '3:10 to Yuma', Josh Hartnett seems bored, and the relationship his character has with Melissa George isn't believable at all.But again, if you want typical vampire gore, enjoy."
2,"meh, not that good","I didn't care for this movie, normally I love vampire & gorefest movies but I just didn't really like this one, why? you may ask, here's why: the camera. the camera jumped & jiggled when it went to a vampire killing someone then movied away really fast before your brain can process what you just saw, & the same thing with the final fight, you couldn't tell what was going on when Josh Hartnett & the vampire leader (didn't catch his name) started trading blows really fast, & it's an action movie (I guess you can count it as horror also, I wouldn't unless you scream during Friday the 13th & Halloween movies, I don't) which you watch for the fighting, right? well if you aren't able to see what happened it's basically just an action movie without action"
1,"Vampires? No, Just Another Zombie Movie","Why do people persist in calling this a vampire movie? Because they climbed buildings or moved fast? Sure they are fast and have superhuman strength, but they didn't need it. Everyone just stood around and waited to be slaughtered. When was the last time you saw a vampire order raw hamburger, or leave 95% of the blood on the ground? I like vampire movies, from John Carpenter's 'Vampires' to 'Lost Boys' because they're usually pretty intelligent. I do not like zombie movies because there's only one plot. Brainless shells eating people. I've never read the comic book but what's with this head 'zombie' talking like a Klingon? It is a very convaluted movie which bored me after about 40 minutes."
2,Not the best,"It's an alright movie. I've seen better vampire movies. I wouldn't waste my money buying this one. i bought it because of all the good reviews, but it's really not as good as people say it is. It's okay. i wouldn't watch it twice though. Just really sorry that i bought it."
1,Bad Service,"I purchased a movie over a month and still have not received it yet. I sent an e-mail and got a response that they forgot to ship it out and that they would in about a day and that was 2 weeks ago and I still have not received it yet. The lady I talked to seemed nice, but I still haven't gotten the movie. I sent an e-mail about 4 days ago and haven't gotten a response back yet."
1,Bad,As quickly as I saw this movie I had forgotten what it was about. Do not waste your time...poorly written just overall bad movie.
2,Could've been good,"I stopped watching this film 40 mins in, why?Let's see, for starters, everything was obvious if you've seen campy horror films before. Next, the acting was annoying! All the actors were pretty much running around with no thought except Ben Foster. Third, the vampires! I love vampire movies, which is why I rented this, but the mindlessness of these guys was pointless. I can't stand mindless killers most of the time. I only like them in zombie films, but the blend of the two doesn't work for me.I knew how this movie was going to go, and didn't need to see more.I was soo upset I went back to Blockbuster wanting a refund or exchange for better. Didn't happen. Glad I only played $5 instead of $11! I wish I hadn't paid $.01!"
5,NASTY NASTY VAMPIRES!,"Hardcore vampire movie? you bet! if you havent seen it before, have garlic bulbs handy. it will scare you. These vampires have piranha shaped teeth. A Very well done movie. Great at Halloween!"
5,ONE OF THE BEST VAMPIRE MOVIES,"The great acting, lovely cinematography and the well written story are what made this such a great vampire movie. It was suspenseful all throughout the movie with plenty of action at the same time. This is an often overlooked film for sure. You will really enjoy this gem over and over again. 5-stars!You can skip the sequel(Dark Days) which was just a horrible mess with a bad plot, bad characters, and bad everything-2 stars max."
4,For Horror Fans Only,"The reviews of this film tend to be either a four star ""nearly perfect"" to a one star ""superficial and cheesy gorefest."" I would agree with both viewpoints. It all depends on what type of movie you're looking for. Fans of cheesy horror flicks will not be disappointed, in my opinion. More discriminating moviegoers will probably walk away rolling their eyes.The movie is pretty standard as far as horror films go: The characters are paper-thin, and all-star performances by Josh Hartnett, Melissa George, and Ben Foster can't fix the rote dialogue that they have to work with. It doesn't matter, though. The camera-work and sets are lush and beautiful, even more so when the blood starts spraying. The score is creepy as well, and best enjoyed in a decent home theatre system.At the 90 minute mark, the movie takes its time and limps across the finish line towards its conclusion at just under two hours. It could have benefited from a little pruning, but it's still a fun little horror film."
3,3.5 out of 5,"I didn't hate this movie, but I think it was a bit slow. It wasn't boring slow but slow in the sense that it just never seemed to go anywhere. I thought the gore was good, I thought the make-up and effects were fair, the acting was fine, but the plot seemed a little boring. 30 days just seemed to fly by, I know they needed to get it over with in 1-2 hours but there were as many as 7 days skipped at a time. I'm also not a huge fan of Vampire movies, I mean they kill the same way every single time, a vicious bite to the neck. So that could be part of it. Anyway, if you like vampire movies and gore go for it because it does a good job with both, but if you're looking for a movie which offers a better variety in scenery and plot skip this one."
2,Audio not upgraded,"Love the movie, the picture is good, but the sound sucks. with all the snow blowing and vampire screams they could have made it sound really eerie."
3,"DAVID SLADE, OPUS 2","**1/2 2007. Directed by David Slade. Alaska. A group of vampires besieges the survivors of a small town lost in snow and in the night. I had a strange feeling during the projection because I had the lingering impression to watch John Carpenter'sThe Thing (Collector's Edition),VampiresandGhosts of Mars (Special Edition)brought together in one piece. So apart for the unusual white, black and blue Arctic setting of the film, you can skip this one. If you're a curious movie lover, you have already seen this film one way or another in your life. Already forgotten."
3,a mediocre vampire movie,"In case you didn't know, in some parts of Alaska, there comes a time when it's dark, no sun, for about a month.In *30 Days of Night*, a small isolated town prepares itself for 30 days of night. Once the phenomenon starts, a band of vampires starts to attack the citizens. An estranged couple, a sheriff and a fire marshal, reunite and round up a group of survivors. The survivors have to hide from building to building every so often to escape the fangs of the vampires...until the sun comes back.That's pretty much it. The gore factor is ok. There's hardly any scare factor. Simple story with simple characters."
4,I thought it was good.,"I've seen some pretty harsh reviews for this movie and I just don't agree. Vampire flicks have come and gone over the years but at least this one was a bit different. The blood suckers were scary at times, the acting was decent, and the effects were great. By todays standards, this is an interesting take on our thirsty friends. Where is the love?"
3,Pretty Good,"I actualy liked this film. I, too, am not one of those 'vampires are supposed to be frilly and romantic' kind of guys so this vamp movie was right up my ally. Bloody and brutal vampires attack and the fun begins. The plot was good and they (directors etc) seemed to cover all their bases when it came to making this as real and logical as possible. Good movie, good atmosphere and great effects. The only gripe I have is with the end. It went off track for me and took away from some of the established realism but it wasnt so bad as to ruin the movie for me. Josh Hartnett is one of the easiest actors from his generation to watch. He brings maturity with him and it doesnt feel like some random handsome guy trying to pull of the hero role. If you like vampire movies and like to see the dirty gritty sadistic side of the vamp and not the fluffy romantic side than this movie is for you. I would have given it 4 stars if not for the ending..."
3,"Great scare, decent film","I'm not a horror junky. I don't like gore. But this film riveted me for some reason and it scared the *@&#ing $+^% out of me. FINALLY someone creates vampires that are actually scary instead of sauve, seductive men who prey on pretty women.HELLO? Vampires are BEASTS. They sold their soul for immortality. I want to see that in a film and this one shows it.Yes, it has flaws. They waste blood. The characters are underdeveloped. The violence is high-speed so you don't see a lot of actual gore (which works for me).The premise is awesome. If you're not too critical and want to be scared? This is the one for you. I slept with the light on the night after I saw this in the theater. My more horror-savvy friends were not scared by it. And I do have to say, ""28 Days Later"" was scarier. But I liked it!"
4,A Good Take on the Modern Vampire Genre,"30 Days of Night is a good take on the modern vampire genre. The more ""savage animal"" characterization was effective and made for some very tense scenes. The early build-up was quite good - as the long night set in, the vampires grip on the town and its resident tightened nicely. Josh Harnett was not the liability I thought he would be and although the end seemed to be far more of a stretch beyond what the rest of the film was, I didn't and you shouldn't let this dissuade you from viewing this film."
1,"It's near the top of my ""worst movies ever"" list","I went to see this movie a week after it came out with my friend, hoping that it'd be a creepy horror gorefest. But it ended up being a boring, poorly written piece of filth that I wasted a good hour and a half on. The story wasn't at all plausible in the sense that the writers assumed that we the audience already knew things such as where the vampires came from, and why they were there. And every single death that happened could be predicted way before they happen. And the acting was horrendous.If it wasn't for my best friend being there making fun of the movie as it went along, I would've asked for a refund. It was a good story idea, just very, very poor implementation into film. Don't waste your time on this film, if you want a good vampire movie, go watch ""The Lost Boys"", ""Nosferatu"", or the Blade series. Pretty much any vampire movie is better than this one."
5,30 Days of Night,Favorite vampire movie. Josh Hartnett is great in this movie. The vampire screech and new look for vampires is great!!!
4,Not sure what people were expecting with this movie...,"But if it was a fun, creepy, well shot and decently paced horror movie, they got it. I've seen reviews that bash this movie on the most ridiculous of things, like why the vampires scream...what? Are you really nitpicking a movie about bloodsucking undead in Alaska? I really think the haters need to get over their preconceptions on this movie, sure it's going to have cliches and jumps scares, but theres so much to like. The vampires are way more in line with my personal preferences on how they would behave; rather than trying to sexually seduce or hypnotize a victim, they just tear them apart. They're vicious beasts, and it's a fantastic portrayal. There's good (not great) lines of dialogue, good action and gore, and it doesn't pull punches. There are problems, sure, but just sit back and enjoy the ride. This isn't a Palme D'or winner about raising a child in a war torn African village...it's a horror movie about vampires. And it's good."
3,eh,"I usually like horror movies with vampires, zombies, and what have you. The premise for this film is intriguing and was new, at least for me. Unfortunately, this movie fell flat on delivery. It is not terrible (though some people think so) but it is not awesome. This is a movie that is better to rent or watch on TV before you decide to buy."
3,It's okay,"*WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS. PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK.*30 Days of Night is an okay movie, could have been better I think. It has a nice idea, and it seemed to pull it off pretty well, I'm just not sure I like the portrayal of the vampires. They seemed too much like (smart) zombies to me. I know they weren't, they were brutal and deadly and not zombies, but it just seemed that way to me for some reason. They seemed like really smart zombies. The character development was a bit lacking too, it had some good characters but the majority of them weren't really great at all. I would have liked it better if Beau (played by Mark Boone Junior) had survived (he seemed like one of the better characters). The ending was satisfying enough, so that gave it more positive points. Overall it's an okay movie, but not one I'd own. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
4,The Scariest Vampire Film Ever!,"I have loved the gothic and supernatural for as long as I can remember. So naturally vampires are one of my favorite mythical monsters. One thing that it is very difficult for a vampire film to do is scare me. However 30 Days of Night is an exception. It is a genuinely creepy, frightening, and scary vampire film! It really feels like what would happen in real life if a band of ravenous, vicious, sociopathic vampires attacked an isolated small town. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and I look forward to sequels. My only significant criticism is that I understand that in the original comic a Vampire Elder named Vicente is the leader of the clan that attacks Barrow, Alaska and that he kills Vampire Leader Marlowe for daring to potentially expose the existence of vampires to humans. I wish that the movie had kept this plot as it sounds very interesting. Overall however, this 30 Days of Night revitalizes the vampire film genre."
4,an unexpected treat,"I haven't yet read the comics by Steve Niles & Ben Templesmith, but I was on a bit of a vampire movie kick after having just read the classic Dracula novel recently and 30 Days of Night was one of the several I DVR'd and watched. I expected little from this, what with it being a ""thriller"", and the fact that adaptations of comics rarely being of much worth--but I will tell you that I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. First of all, the concept is brilliant and a no-brainer, but it's really pretty well produced and a thrilling watch. So check it out, and I hope to read the source material soon."

4,Review from All Music Guide (allmusic.com),"DJ John Kelley is a well-established figure on the West Coast breaks scene, and what he serves up here with his first artist album is a solid 46 minutes of pure funk pleasure, most of it instrumental and all of it written by Kelley in collaboration with a variety of friends and colleagues, mainly Brian Saitzyk and Brian Golub. Kelley knows how to mix up the flavors and textures without sacrificing his groove, and he also knows when it's time to let a fleet-fingered turntablist come in and spice things up, which Spider does brilliantly on both ""Dye Sky Drive"" and the heavyweight ""Funkasaurus."" There's also a nice cameo by rapper Dynamite Jive on ""Eighty Eight."" Those who don't have a natural affection for breakbeats may find things getting a bit tired by the end, but they're probably off dancing somewhere else anyway. Highly recommended."
3,"Great performance, so-so sound quality","Aida is my favorite opera and I have heard most recorded versions and been to many live performances. This CD captures a particulary good performance and is worth buying both for the price and the quality of the singers. I don't agree with other reviewers about the quality of the sound. The voices are not well balanced against the orchestra. It almost sounds like the singers were too close to the microphone. I found it hard to find a comfortable volume for listening. Maybe the fault lies in the digital remastering, or maybe I just got a bad CD. Addendum: I have had a chance to listen to this recording several times since I wrote the above review. It really is an excellent performance, and I got used to the sound quality. It is definitely worth buying and it gets better each time I listen to it."
3,"Excellent introduction to Aida, with only a couple of issues","This CD was one of my first purchased opera recordings, as the price fitted for someone who was only nominally interested in opera, but it got me firmly hooked. The vocal dynamics of all the leading cast members are excellent, with Domingo providing a vibrant Radames, and Arroyo showing excellent control in O patria mia. The balance of the orchestra between the triumphal march and arias like Celeste Aida is spot on. However I find the sound quality a little poor on this recording, with a few garbles. I also wish that there were three discs, as the two disc split happens directly in the middle of Act2 Scene 1 as Amonasro is about to enter into his solo. For the price, though, it can't be beat."
2,I'm going to buy a different Aida CD,"First the disclaimer - I'm new to opera and not an expert on sound quality. That being said - I simply can't listen to this CD. There is something about the sound that isn't right. It's like static or white noise or something that is especially prevalent when there is singing. Again, I'm not a sound quality expert, I just know something about this CD makes it bother me and I can't listen to it. My wife, on the other hand, doesn't notice the stuff that bothers me at all, so take that for whatever it's worth. Regarding the opera - it seems fantastic. The music sounds great and the voices do to. I'm definitely going to buy another Aida CD. I just can't listen to this one. I recommend finding a different recording."
2,Discouraging sound quality mutes strong performances,"With Domingo and Arroyo taking the leading roles, and Abbado conducting, you'd have every right to expect an engaging performance. But the sound quality is so low that the performers are difficult to enjoy. The vocalists sound as though they are singing through several layers of waxed paper, while the orchestra seems to be phoning it in over a cheap handset. Overall, the sound quality approximates that of an early transistor radio. What a shame, since, no doubt, the actual performances were quite wonderful."
1,Terrible sound,"Well, the singing is good. But the sound is appalling - analog tape dropouts and cockles, poor stereo depth, distortion, useless dynamic and crummy applause editing. So bad it detracts from the music. I threw this out and am now searching for a better version."
5,Absolutely wonderful!,"When ordering, I was a bit worried that this pendant would turn out to be smaller than the matching earrings, or that they somehow would look weird together. Well, I shouldn't have wasted my energy on worrying, because this pendant really took my breath away! I'm actually jealous of my grandma, for whom I bought it!The peridot is beautiful, free of visible inclusions, is well-cut and has a vivid and clear green colour. It also looks great with the earrings, as it's a little bigger, but otherwise identical to them.I can't really believe that I got such beautiful presents for just $60!"
1,"Either look for real movies, or for real Porn! These will satisfy neither.","Many of these stories are simple, artless soft-porn packaged as if they were movies. Hey, i really love nudity & eroticism myself, but i just can't appreciate it when it is done as crude & untilligent as it is here. Sex still needs to be either plot or character driven even for me, not some mindless random drivel searching for an STD like in these flicks! As one reviewer on a different site said ""these weren't filmed, they were taped!"". Pretty much describes it. Even a piece like ""Mansion of Madness"" which has appreciable cult status (& much less nudity than some of the others incidentally)is still in very bad reproduction here. I don't recommend you spend your money here unless you are just really looking for low quality, plotless, artless soft-sex tapes. Few movies here, & certainly none of good reproduction like Anchor Bay has been doing. Look elsewhere is my advice."
4,MSR,BEST LIQUID FUEL STOVES IN THE WORLD. I RECOMMEND MSR PRODUCTS TO EVERYONE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN OUTDOOR SPORTS.
1,good stoves but terrible pumps,MSR has always made great lightweight stoves but have made terrible pumps. I have been through three generations of pumps. The first generation came apart on a winter trip scattered fuel everywhere and set the snow on fire. Tabs holding the pump handle broke off. The second generation also breaks tabs but at least it didn't set me on fire. It also simmered well. The third generation (shown here) switched to a rubber cup instead of leather so it siezes in hot desert weather. You have to oil it often. The check valves fail easily. It will not simmer. Nor does it turn off properly leaving the stove burning at a low level. You have to blow it out to be sure. It also has weak plastic threads that strip easy. It no longer has an O ring on the bottle so it will eventually leak in your pack. The second generation pump was the best of a bad lot but this new one is worthless.
1,False Claims,"The pump is not the lightest on the market compared even to MSR's original pump model which has worked fine for me the past six years. It also claims to have ""superior flame control"" which may only be true if you using it with the SimmerLite. I used it with a WhisperLite Internationale and it had absolutely no control other than full blast, or off. Save your money if you're just trying to update your stove."
2,"Crap Pump, Good Stove","How does a company make a valve inlet out of metal and then make the socket out of soft plastic? The internal threads of the valve pin stripped its housing and caused a minor explosion out of the bottle. The stove is great, the bottle pumps are pathetic and mildly dangerous (please note that the pumps usually say ""Respect Fire,"" in a peculiar case of irony)."
4,The best MSR pump yet.,"The newest version of the standard MSR pump boasts the most robust construction yet. Earlier models had major issues with the pump rod retaining tabs snapping off. This new design uses a twist system to remove the plunger from the tube. I picked this up to replace an older gray pump that came with a used whisperlite i picked up. It worked fine. The only gripe i have is that MSR chose to replace the easily obtainable o-ring seal on the earlier models with a proprietary seal/grip ring on this current model. It's not a big gripe, but if you need to replace it you need to go to their maintenance kit and not just the hardware store like before."
4,So far so good,"I have had the same whisperlite stove for over 20 years, and just this past year had to replace the pump. I have only used it on 3 camping trips so far and it has worked just as well as the original. For this reason I will give it 4 stars. However, I cannot provide a true rating until I experience the long term durability of the product."
1,worthless for older stove,"I picked up one of these for an older Whisperlite that has always worked great. I dropped the old pump on a concrete floor and the plastic tabs that held it together broke off - end of pump. The store clerk assured me that this one would work great with my stove, so I grabbed it and headed out on my trip, there being no time to adequately test it beforehand.What a disaster. This pump is basically on-off for anything but a new Simmerlite stove. It's on was also barely a simmering flame, so much of my trip was spent babying the stove, praying that the silly thing would actually boil a pot of water.Upon my return, I took the pump back to the shop for a refund. I will be investigating how I might get the old pump to hold together. It is vastly superior to this cruddy substitute. Save your money!"
4,Colorful and Concise!,"I have used this textbook for 10 years now and I have always had a positive student response to it. It's colorful, concise and conversational in tone-not dry and boring like many books. I wish the authors would do an updated vcrsion, as the 2nd Edition has been around for a long time and needs some modern touches."
1,Great Idea but,"No matter how good you think your product is, you still have to support it if you sell it as a commercial product. After multiple attempts at overcoming problems in the install/configuration with fonts appearing as bar code on two different machines. I wrote an email to Slackware. No problem resolution, they gave up. I've used just about every Linux distro out there and this was a disappointment considering what I had read about the product. Maybe a great product, but some house cleaning needs to be done in the support office. When you sell something as a commercial product it is no longer a hobby. Wasted my money!"
3,"Stochastic Man: An interesting read, but nothing special","I can happily say that I started to read this book with no expectations as to the quality of the storyline etc. I think if I had had any, I may have been disappointed.That said, Mr. Silverberg tells an interesting (to a point) tale of a character who is able to predict the future with a reasonable degree of accuracy. His life changes radically when he meets someone who actually can see the future as it will happen.Throw in stuff about bone smoking, Kama Sutra style sex (not explicit) and a healthy dose of politics and thats the novel.I've read better, and I've read much worse. If nothing else, you might get a new view on life and death."
3,Dice Not God's Game.,"Silverberg sets this novel 25 years into the future, but alas the future overtook his dates. His main character votes for predetermined futures, quoting Reverend Einstein that God would not so play dice. Although there is a bit of dialogue on parallel universes and reversed arrows of time, this story lacks the elements that would hang it on the peg of science fiction. Rather, it is a tale of psi and clairvoyance. Tales on future prediction and the death of free will belong in the genre of new age philosophy along with Edgar Cayce's. Still a good read."
3,Madame fait la grosse voix...,"Bon, tant qu'à faire, il faut le dire tout de suite : Ewa Podles a une voix somptueuse. Un rien engorgée, mais somptueuse. Son aigu est renversant, son grave ne l'est pas moins (quand elle ne s'évertue pas à dépasser le fa grave). Ce qui la rend incournable chez Rossini, encore que son allure de Baba Yaga conviendrait mieux au personnage de Ulrica dans le Bal Masqué qu'à Isabelle dans l'Italienne à Alger... Mais chez Handel, est-ce bien le propos que de rouler sans cesse des mécaniques, et gromeler des graves de baryton à tout va ? Et les variations, piquées sans scrupule à Marilyn Horne pour la plupart des airs... Est-ce bien honnte ? Elle remercie d'ailleurs un célèbre claveciniste pour l'avoir aidée dans la composition des da capos, ce qui est très gentil de sa part... Un bon disque en somme, surtout si vous aimez les belles et bonnes voix bien grassouillettes, mais dans ces mmes airs nous avons eu droit a des interprétations un peu plus habitées."
3,"""Good enough"" for diabetics","My two year old is a Type 1 diabetic and naturally he doesn't understand why he can't have the same foods his brother and sisters have without getting insulin. To try to combat this (and donate to research at the same time) I bought these cookies.Overall, they will do in a pinch. While they were full of coconut flavor they were dry as dirt. The sweetness is a treat and of course, the fact that BG doesn't go crazy is a plus. Truth be told though we prefer other low carb desserts."
1,6 boxes of cookies all expiring in less than 2 months,"The 1-star rating is given to the shameless company that sell and ship this product, not to the product itself.The reason i NEVER order food online is bcoz they only ship you the product expiring VERY SOON. Prior to ordering from amazon, I went to several gourment markets in my neighborhood that said they carry the product, but actually they do not. I resolved to my last option- online order. and guess what? all 6 boxes of cookies arrived in the condition that I've feared/expected- expiring in 1.5 month from the date of arrival."
2,Good for first time beginners- but a little TOO basic.,"I got this book as a gift since I just recently started making my own greeting cards for family and friends. While I did learn some interesting tips, I think the projects are a bit too basic, and the end result isn't as spectacular as you may be hoping for. Some of the projects require a sewing machine or tools you probably won't use too often (like for working metal).There are little galleries in between projects, and some of the cards are much nicer than the projects in this book- making me feel like the book was lacking (a lot).I'd pick a more complex card book over this one (even if the projects seem more intimidating, the end result will be MUCH NICER)- at least it would give you something to work towards. I would only recommend this book to a teacher who wants to come into class with some interesting projects for your students."
5,One Stop Shop for CCNP Study!,"This box set is really the only thing you need to purchase for CCNP certification. I'd read these books over Sybex's every day of the week and twice on Sunday. **Note: I really DID read these books all week, and then would read straight through twice on Sunday!!** Yes, this book has errors, they all do. Check the publisher's site for errata. Although at times they can be very dry, technical, and perhaps convey more information then needed on certain topics, more is certainly preferable to less. I really like the essay questions at the beginning and end of the chapter, they make sure you *know* the material covered and the exam objectives. If nothing else, purchase this set for the 200+ question quiz engine contained in each of the 4 books. Unlike Sybex's, these AREN'T the questions in the book. If you score well on the multiple choice flashcard program, it's exam time.Jayson TobiasCCNP CCDP"
3,"Too many errors , and no effort to correct them","I think this is the first book I've ever seen where the author's name is misspelled on the cover - the Routing book spells it ""Claire"" Gough, but all the other references are to ""Clare"". That's not really substantive, but it's indicative of the kind of problems in the text. I just passed the routing exam today, but I spent more study time than I wanted to trying to figure out how things really worked, and which parts of the book were right and which were in error. I've written to Cisco Press twice, and another reviewer has written several times starting several months ago; there's a section for errata on [...], but nothing for this book as of today. I don't know whether that means that there are so many errors they've just given up, or maybe they've cut back on staffing. In any case, I got the third printing - I'll be curious to see if they correct the author's name on the cover in future printings."
1,Product outdated,"This book does not cover the new exams that have been revised as of September, 2002. Don't bother, wait for the next release."
5,Work on Editing,"I am an intermediate ESL student, and this book is excellent to help you wheter you want to focus on EDITING your writing; moreover, this book explains rules such as run-on sentences, subject-verb agreement, fragments, verbs, subject-pronoun agreement, adjectives, etc. I recommend it to people who do not have clear how to write their ideas."
4,great lables,bought for continuity with what I already have I bought it because my previous experience with it
4,Maybe works maybe does not,"Seems to work, then other times it does not, maybe squirrels are getting smart and maybe I haven't found the right chirp and click. But, product is fine, does what is intended."
