3,Chapter after Chapter,"When She Hollers was a good book. The novel brought me closer as if I was dealing with the sexual abuse of Tish's stepfather and the ignorance of her mother. I felt like I was Tish and I wanted to scream at the mother for not believing me, when Tish said Tonnie was abusing her. Cynthia Voigt made the book for non-stop reading because you cannot put it down until you read the last page. When She Hollers is about a girl named Tish, who is getting sexually abused by her stepfather and when she confronts her mother about it she doesn&#65533;t believe her. If you want to know more about the book you just have to find it at your local library or buy it online. If you need a inspirational book, this is it!"
2,I could not relate to it.,"I personally did not like this book. Unlike the other reviewers who shared their opinions here, I did not find Tish's response to be realistic. As a survivor myself, there were other emotions that were not factored into this story. Where was the self-blame? Where's the belief that what she's going through was ""normal?"" Yes, children who were abused feel that their family is ""normal."" The entire book was written as if the author felt sorry for children who were molested with the added feature of a strong heroine. For a more realistic portrayal of sexual abuse, I recommend ""Silver"" by Norma Fox Mazer or ""Abby, My Love"" by Hadley Irwin."
4,Uncomfortable and hard hitting,"Cynthia Voigt has a way with getting to her readers. The whole time I was reading this book I felt extremely uncomfortable. She kept me so close to Tish, the main character, as she had to deal with her stepfather's sexual abuse and her mother's feigned ignorance of the issue. The book is really amazing in its portrayal of an abuse victim. I think anyone would benefit from the read but it may also help victims cope with the feelings of guilt and loneliness that they face during and after the abuse."
5,Groundbreaking,"THe writing is amazing. THe reader totally identifies with Tish, even if he/she hasn't experienced assault. You feel her rage and fear. Good dialogue. Good everything."
2,When She Hollers,Overall I felt that this book was rather confusing. Too many things were happening at once. It was very hard to understand. This book was about a girl named Tish that was being sexually abused by her stepfather. She carried a survival knife in her boot so that if he ever came after her she could just stab him. Tonnie became very abusive as the book went on. Tish decided that she was going to step up and take action and that's what she did. She went a lawyer and told him what had been going on and he told her that since she was old enough to press charges she could. The end of the book wasn't very good. It just stopped. It didn't say what happened between Tish and her stepfather. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes reading suspenseful novels.
4,love lost,"This is an engrossing story of family life and values in the early part of the 20th century. Interwoven tales of found love and lost love runs throughout the novel. The heroine finds herself unwittingly in charge of the extended family that puts itself above all other families in the area. She has to deal with a dying child, a loveless marriage, and the weight of family ancestors. She falls in love with the new owner of the neighboring estate. She draws the parallel between her love for this new man and the love her father-in-law has for a woman he has loved and kept close for most of his married life to an invalid wife. Suspense builds as we wonder what decisions she will make and what will become of 'the family'."
2,Nothing New Here,"Early Autumn won the Pulitzer in 1926, and like many of the Pulitzer winners around this time, the focus was much more on the story than the storytelling. Unfortunately, the story being told was one that's been told a million times before. Woman marries into wealthy and prestigious family. Her husband is cold and indifferent. She falls in love with a lowly farmhand. They promise to run away together. Instead, they don't.There are 4 similar books I can think of off hand that tell a similar story but are much more engaging."
5,good for what ails you!,"Heartfelt songs, soulful singing, and great playing. Some of these songs will give you the blues, and others will cure them for you. Catch this band live while they're still touring smaller clubs. They answer the question, ""What would the Velvet Underground have sounded like with Gram Parsons in the group?"""
1,Not what the title says it is!,This is not an air idle control valve! I is possibly a crankshaft sensor. Make sure you check it closely!
5,Perfect For Building,"Case has lots of room to work with. Allows to use 120mm fans in front and back. Side Vents. No one ever said you needed to spend a fortune on your case to make a great computer rig..... The front is completely vented, cause it is all mesh so it can freely flow air.... There is also an Air Duct that adjusts to the height of your CPU cooler to draw straight cooler air from out side the case straight to the CPU... I would recommend..... The Name Says It All COOOOOLER MASTER>>>"
3,disappointing follow-up to 'The Funky Breaks',"too much pop, not enough down-to-earth breakbeat music that pervaded his previous album. a couple of songs are worth a listen or mix, but that's about it."
5,DJ ICey is the best electronic artist alive,"If your looking for a DJ to become your favorite for electronic music, stop searching. DJ Icey is the bomb! I defy anyone to listen to this cd and not like it. Everyone I know that doesn't listen or really like electronic music always like DJ Icey. Listen and learn!"
1,DJ Icey needs warming up,"This album has no heart. DJ Icey took entirely no time to discover a decent grove, this one seems like a bunch of samples thrown together at random. The beat, acid, basslines, and vocals are mismatched on every single song and don't strengthen each other like they should. There is no sufficient formula here. I'd pass."
4,good breaks that will have you moving,"DJ Icey goes a little bit off the beaten path of techno in that all of his samples are not technically samples, but recorded lyrics by Christian Ford. While I like 'old school' samples like used by the Wiseguys, this album still rocks. The best track is probably ""Not a Test"", then maybe ""Can't Stop this Track."" While a couple of tracks could have been mixed a little better, this album is better than Icey's first, the Funky Breaks."
4,Dj Icey knows how to groove,"The break beat Dj Icey is back with a killer album of his own breaks. A Galaxy of breaks indeed! The first two singles (""Not a Test"" and ""City of groove"") released from this album gave us a taste a few months back of what to expect from the iceman, But still they didn't prepare us for the antigravity of ""Can't stop this track"" and ""Acid Conga"" And the vocals from Mystro ( Christian Ford ) are outstanding! Breakbeat lovers, this is a must!"
4,Nike Watch,This was to replace the same watch that my husband had had for 4 years before it just stopped. We replaced the battery but it only worked for a few days and stopped again. My husband loves this watch and was really heart broken when it stopped working. It was a fathers day gift from his son. So I looked on Amazon and found it. I ordered it in Feb. and gave it to him for Valentines day. Her was very very happy. :)
3,"Not bad, not great","The book on arena is an excellent primer on simulation, but some of the higher level arena examples are not very clear.I would recommend it to someone new in the field, or taking a class. However, this is not as good as other how-to programming books out there ..."
5,Funniest writer ever?,"Woody's short humor is hilarious. It simply has to be read by anyone who appreciates prose humor. If you are about to get run over by a bus, postpone doing so and go out and buy this book. If you have jumped off a bridge, put off hitting the ground until reading this book. You will not be disappointed. Even if you don't like his movies (I myself am only a fan of his earlier work in the 70s) give his fiction and articles a try, because they are nothing like the whiny humor he does on film. How can you do that on the page anyway? Completely different kinds of humor, the written humor far surpassing the filmed humor, in my opinion."
5,The Ultimate in Intellectual Humour,"This is genuinely hilarious and intelligent prose. My favourites are ""Mr Big"", ""Viva Vargas!"" and ""Reminiscences, People and Places"". Prepare to convulse. People will stare at you while you gasp for oxygen. Pure genius. The only mystery is why Allen isn't as well recognised for his writing as his movies. If you read this you will also wonder.Allen sometimes seems to step over the line separating sharp satire from outright cynicism, especially in the later writing - but who cares? It's still a class apart. Highly recommendable."
5,"Violent, dark, stylish, and beautiful","After seeing six episodes on a friend's computer last year, I was enthralled by the series' brooding atmosphere, it's ultraviolence, and sense of style. Alucard is the ultimate anti-hero, leaving undead bits all over the place as the result of his ten millimeter handgun. Sera is good as the ""innocent turned undead"" role, unwillingly developing a taste for human blood. The priest makes a great bad guy, his cackle becoming his calling card. I can't wait to get my hands on the dvd."
2,Not Up to My Expectations,"I would first of all like to say that I have read the manga for this anime, and found it very enjoyable. Upon liking it so much, I decided to try out the TV series. I rented this first disc, and was sadly disappointed. From the high quality of the manga that I experienced, I was hoping for the same quality from the DVD's. But I was sadly disappointed. The plotline was askewed and confusing, and this is coming from a person who already knew it. The animation itself is not nearly as detailed and interesting as that of the manga, and the characters, especially Alucard (not Arucard, or Arukard) are more annoying than cool, which is how they are in the manga. It is my recommendation that this anime be left to the books, and not made into television, for this representation is misleading in terms of quality. For those of you out there who like the idea, but not the presentation of this DVD, I strongly recommend the manga as an alternative."
4,Vash meets Vampire Hunter D,Here is a series that...like Cowboy Bebop and TRIGUN...bleeds cool. Alucard is awesome and the music rivals that of Bebop.Highly recommended!!
4,An undead cowboy beebop,"From seeing the first instalment, i belive it's going to be a great collection for anyone that's into anime. It's like [vampire hunter D] but in a series with such more to offer, that the posabilities are endless. I would recomend this future series to anyone into sci-fi or just into vamps.A+++++P.S. go out and buy it right away!!!!!"
5,No Spoilers Simple Review,"-= No Spoilers =-Hellsing has some great action, great cinematography, and very fluid animation. The translated subtitled English dialogue was done well and watching the first DVD made me want to watch the following episodes even more.I have not finished watching the series but so far, it looks great."
4,One of the best,"Take one double bass player(Danny Thompson ex Pentangle no less)one Kora player(Toumani Diabate)and a Flamenco group(the wonderful Ketama)and put them all in one room and you will have something very special. It was sad indeed to find no reviews of this fabulous recording so I will TRY and do it some justice .So many attempts at mixing different types of ""world "" music end up in a hodge podge of sounds and styles that satisfy no one and merely dilute the source, but this is the real deal.The overiding feeling of this disc is PLEASURE...the musicians involved are obviously swimming in the delights of the music they are creating,the discoveries they are making about themselves and their music.This disparate band somehow produces a seamless and invigorating stream of music that will take you to places even they never dreamed of.Buy it....."
3,Good book - no CD,"I was led to believe that this book came with a CD. I'm kicking myself because I got the book and found no CD in it! That's primarily why I bought it. The CD with the contracts on it is much more expensive so you better be a good typist and recreate the contracts. The good part of the book though is that it really does help to explain all of the hard to understand parts of the contracts so I am still glad I bought it, but was still hugely disappointed that it didn't come with the contracts."
5,A fine and thorough book,"Litwak provides about as much as a professional could share in this throrough outing. He also shares 'boilerplate' contracts for virtally all key players in a film production. Of course, direct experience is the best teacher, but EVERY neophyte in film or television must own this book, and its a handy reference for seasoned professionals and part-timers.Also check out his companion book, ""Dealmaking..."" which has priceless cues on what gray areas to avoid in negotiating with lawyers and their clients.Essential for producers, directors, writers and anyone hoping to get financed or paid or both!"
3,Decent book - no CD,"This book is a good collection of legal contracts for the industry, but it doesn't have a CD-ROM or associated website where you can download the contracts as a starting-point template.I believe the author is gouging us by forcing us to buy the CD separately. Very cheesy business practice. I hope you have OCR software to scan these pages into your computer."
4,For those serious about producing,"Good basic legal information oriented towards the independent feature film producer but useful for anyone who wants to produce film or other distributed video. Won't replace having an attorney but will allow you to do some things by yourself and understand what is going on when you need to hire one. Similar to ""The Independent Film Producer's Survival Guide"" but with enough distinct material (example contracts for instance) to be worth having both."
2,Okay Product,It does not keep the signal from the computer to the projector constant. The images flicker occassionaly which disrupts the program. It may be that it overheats. As long as it is not used for a long period and it stays unplugged it works fine for 45 minutes or so.
2,no pnp,"i use it with a dual view setup using vista os, the problem is, that during the boot i can see the picture on the connected monitors, but once vista boots up, the dual view is automatically disabled because vista doesn't recognize the splitter as connected device. the only way to bypass this problem is connecting one of the connected to splitter monitors, strate to the computer during bootup, and then after setting dualview setup and getting the picture, connect the vga output back to the splitter. Once it works, all good till the next bootup."
4,bold foray into non-PC world of women betraying women,"An astonishing investigation into the ways that women compete against women. Each story traces a scene of betrayal -- of sister against sister, of wife against other woman, of mother against daughter. A bold statement in this era of political correctness and the sacrifice of unpleasant truth to comforting denials"
2,I was disappointed.,I really looked forward to hearing American Pie & was not happy that this CD has the shortened version.
2,Don't get,"This CD is a waste of your money. It has the cut version of ""American Pie"" instead of the full-length version."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this CD just before a long car ride, just for the song American Pie. Imagine my frustration when I discovered that the track I wanted was cut short! The reason I give this two stars, instead of the lowest, is that after listening to more of the CD, I discovered that there were other good songs. If you want to hear American Pie, don't buy this. But if you want other Mclean songs, than this is sufficient."
4,An inexpensive CD for priceless songs,"Yes, this is not a definitive collection--and American Pie is not its full length--but look at the cost for so many other greats! I bought it solely for ""And I Love You So"" and am satisfied. DM performs that song better than anyone else. For those who love romance it should be a staple. ""If We Try"" is wonderful as a ""getting to know you"" song. ""Everyday"" is a great version of the standard--and an upbeat message to someone you're loving more and more all the time.Way back in the 80s I was talking to a very good and versatile lounge performer. He said he hated being asked for American Pie, Castles in the Air, Vincent and other McLean songs because they took way too much talent and effort--and he knew he didn't have it at that level. He said, ""I can fake a lot of others, but nothing of Don McLean's."" Even a limited--but reasonably priced--McLean CD will prove his wisdom."
1,aaaaaauuuuuuuugggghhhh!,the greatest song of all time is cut extremely short. this is the worst purchase I ever made oon the internet. And the rest of the songs pretty much suck.
2,Don't get it,"The cd is ok, I suppose, but American Pie is cut! That was my reason for getting the cd, and I don't even get the full song!"
3,Brilliance....,"I found this album phenominal unlike my peers where else might one find such tremendous tracks as ""Everyday"", ""You Have Lived"", and ""Babylon."" I trust that those of you who disliked the album soley disliked it based on the version of American Pie I prefer the longer version along with the rest of the world but if that's the case buy ""American Pie"" Don McLean is an underappreciated artist, whom I'd kill to have play this album and nothing more at my fraternity partyHe is brilliant and you must expand your mind to his other tracks he's not a 2-hit wonder!"
2,Not the full version of American Pie,"Somehow I missed reading the other reviews. Had I read them I would not have ordered, as I wanted American Pie and the shortened version was a disappointment. Luckily, was an inexpensive purchase - and my fault for not reading."
3,Spend a few dollars more ...,"At the current going rate of this single disc collection, I strongly suggest spending a few extra dollars to getAnd I Feel Fine.....The Best Of The IRS Years 82-87 Collector's Edition. Over twice as many selections from REM's early work.Not that there's anything wrong with what's picked here, but there are a lot of great songs like ""Superman"", ""Begin the Begin"", and ""Gardening at Night"" not included on this collection. So unless you're getting this specifically for some of the rarer B-sides I would go for the ""I Feel Fine"" collection noted above."
2,Too flat for me,"I'm not a trance guru, and sorry to drag down the rating on this album by being the only one to complain about this album. For me this two-CD set is too flat. No ups or downs. no climax. Maybe it'd be good for ambient music, but my feeling was that you could almost lay an another set of mix on top of it. It was that flat for me. I liked the ""Trance: State of altered consiousness"" although I have to agree with others that it contains some cheesy mix. I loved Sasha's ""Expander"" and expected similar taste from this mix, but I guess I was wrong. Anyway, I was looking for more climax and ""themes"", or even some melodies, but this album was just not my type."
3,"Sashas compilation is weak; however, Digger makes up for it.","The first CD of the two lacks in energy and excitement. It seems Sasha put it together just for the money...just like his live performance i saw last year. I never liked his style (of music), but i thought i'd give him another chance. Big downer. On the other hand, CD2 more than makes up for it. In my opinion, Digger drastically out-performs his mate. Too bad this double CD isn't sold as separate single CDs. I give CD1 2stars, Cd2 4stars. Neither compare to Oakenfold!"
4,Real dope cd,I really like this cd All of the songs except for one are real nice. Well mixed. Sasha is the man
4,really keen.,"this is great - high energy, great flow, sublime undercurrents. my only complaint regards the very few vocal-heavy tracks, which sound as though they're performed by any one of whatever ecstasy-addled groupies were lolling about outside the studio."
5,Truly Amazing,"This CD is absolutely fantastic. Sasha and John Digweed both did a superb job in mixing this CD. Sasha mixes the first CD, and John Digweed the second. To be perfectly honest with you, I can't put one over the other. Sasha and Digweed are both masters of their own game. It's arguable that they are two of the most talented DJs in the entire world. After listening to this recording, I'd have to agree. Words really can't do justice to describe the feeling I get when I listen to it. This is pure magic."
4,Welcome to Deep Trance,"Maybe it's just that I have heard so many great comp. that my standards are just too high, but I expected more. A lot of it I had heard before but for what it is.....it's damn good...Not that best out there though."
5,My favorite Trance cd PERIOD,"The northern exposure serious with Sasha and John Digweed is spectacular. I don't believe any other modern trance works compare. This however, stands out the most. Both discs (one from sasha one from digweed) are incredible and will have you dancing around your house. Sasha's disc is a little more upbeat, but Digweed's music is just beutiful and ""airy"". I can't recommend you pick this up enough. Sasha and Digweed are the worlds most talented electronic duo no matter how popular they become."
4,Outer Space,"Expeditions: an awesome collection of the choicest underground trance and progressive house music. This CD unfolds what makes the best Djs in the world really buzz. The music lacks the hard hit and tweaks that are otherwise the very heart of trance music, but that in all makes the collection of music wizardry a class beyond compare. This CD brings forth some very refreshing sounds and puts the listener through a variety of moods, all in synchronism and feather touch mixes rolling one into another. Enjoy this...a definite classic from the legedary jocks."
4,Give it time,"yes, everyone says the second disc is better then the first, I beg to differ. Though this is not at the top of my listening preference right now, every time I listen to it, it will grow a little more on me. The reason I say the first disc might be better, is simply because it is a little different then what I expected to hear. Give it a chance and spend the bucks,its worth it!"
5,Beautifull and rythmic,"A must for anyone who loves trance, the music isn,t like rave music, its more like after-rave relax tracks. Space Maneuvres is a FANTASTIC song. Peace happy ravers."
4,Ultimate Progressiveness,"Even though the samples' are a bit short, you could still feel the ambient yet sharp trance style coming through, if my last $25 had to be spent on music, this CD would be my first choice. Respect to the creators'"
4,A little dissapointing!,"Well,I waited for this CD for months with great anticipation.Should'nt have gotten my hopes up! There are some great tracks here,don't get me wrong.(space manouevers is incredible)any crew?....negative!.But the other tracks are king of a let down.I found myself listening to Northern Exposure II again quite quickly.Oh well,i'm sure the more you listen..the better it get's..right?At least I hope so!!"
5,masterpiece,"This set is easily one of the most definitive mixes I've ever heard. First off, you have two of the best DJs out there: Sasha and John Digweed. Sasha's mix (CD1) is good, but it lacks the smoothness of Digweed's set (CD2). I've never gotten into Sasha's set (I still enjoy it, but not a huge fan). Digweed's mix is simply amazing. I love the transitions between songs and the CD has these great waves of beats from dark and gritty to smooth and sexy. It is a great mix to listen to late a night when you're tired and the hypnotic rhythms put you in a head bobbing mood. Digweed keeps building and building until you can't take it any more, which is why Gamelan and Enjoy the Silence are my two favorite points in Digweed's set. Both Sasha and Digweed have made a hit that is both a classic and legendary."
3,Very Average,"Two years after the original, Sasha and John Digweed are back with Northern Exposure: Expeditions.""Space Manoeuvres"" by Stage One sets the overall theme of this two disc set. Overabundant spacey trance tracks fill up most of both discs. For this reviewer's taste, it can get a little tiresome for an entire disc, let alone two of them. I am not that impressed with this album, especially when compared to the quality of the original.Both discs get 3/5 stars."
2,What happened?,"The first two installmets of NE are masterpieces. Those melodic, complex compostions are very subtle and deserve to be listened to over and over. So what the hell happened this time? Sure, there are some decent tracks here but so much of this collection is rediculously repetitive and annoying that I can not understand why so many people liked this CD. The reason why the first two installmets are so good is that they use elements of many different styles ranging from New Age to fast intense techno similar to the likes of the Chemical Brothers, Fluke, Uberzone, etc.. This third installment replaces all those comlexities with endless boring repetition. Very disappointing."
5,Can't get enough,"How would I describe Rachael Yamagata's work? Her music is bluesy, innovative, timeless and clasic. Her voice is full, rich, husky, expressive, bluesy, sexy, but also silky smooth and sweet as honey! Rachael has received many rave reviews in the major entertainment press and I can see why. Every song here is a virtual masterpiece. Her full-length album Happenstance is even more impressive. I promise you will be hooked from the very start!For a treat, watch some of Rachael's streaming performances on the MTV.com and VH1 websites."
4,True Art,"yes, i gave the EP 4 stars, but i give rachael yamagata a whole hearted 5.the EP's best songs are ""the reason why"" and ""would you please"" where her raw emotion really shines through. the ep's catchiest track, ""worn me down"", gets lost in overproduction and loses its emotion and meaning from when performed live.still, rachael yamagata is a true breeze of fresh air in this world of garbage ""singer-songwriters"" (avril, branch, whatever crap trl plays). she is a true artist/musician and i cannot wait till her full length album is released."
3,Good not great,"Certain folks would have you believe this one is the next big thing. Maybe so, but not based on this EP. It's one of those that you listen to in the car and say to the person beside you ""Interesting, huh?"" and then two songs later one of you says ""Do you mind if we just listen to the radio instead?"" Maybe she'll blow me away with the full-length. Or then again maybe not."
3,I hope the best is yet to come,"I first caught Rachael Yamagata performing live for RollingStone.com and absolutely loved what I heard. Her live version of ""The Reason Why"" blows this EP version away. Although her vocals will be compared to the likes of Fiona Apple... Rachael seems to have her own thing goin' on. The EP tracks are good, but perhaps the best is yet to come.I read an interview recently where Rachael said she's making lists of possible producers she wants for the full album. Based on her live performances and this EP, I hope the producers who come on board are more in tune with her music's full potential:)"
2,sounds familiar,"I just cannot waste any more time listening to these singers that sound like everyone else. Take song 3 off this album, nice but Sinaed Oconnor has done this sound time and again and the last time I wanted to hear it before I never listened again was like 1993. Nice voice and I know she's trying but can someone please come up with something original?"
4,I saw PRO-FANITY!!,"I loved this, but even though I would give it 5 stars, it deserves 4, because Lum was called a BITCH of all dirty things! I think they could have made something better! A rated 12 and up!"
3,Terrific value.,I bought this for a 14 year old boy and read much of it before I mailed it to him. The facts are presented in a really fun format. The type of book you can pick up and read for five minutes or an hour. This would be a good book for any parent of a 4 year old to read! It answers lots of questions that we have all asked at one time or another.
5,EXCELENTE,"ESTE CABLE ME RESULTO DE MUY BUENA CALIDAD,ADEMAS MUY COMODO AL MOMENTO DE SER UTILIZADO,SE ESTIRA Y SE RETRAE TAL CUAL COMO LO ES,MUY RECOMENDADO."
2,PLAYBOY GIRL'S NEXT DOOR SEASON 4!!!!,"AT THIS POINT IN THE SEASON 4 THERE WAS NOTHING AT ALL OEIGINAL ABOUT ANYTHING ON THERE,WASTE OF MONEY,LOL[....] TO KEEP HIM PERKY AND I DOUBT THEY EVER HAD SEX WITH ANY OF THEN,LOL,THAT WOULD BE LIKE HEY MY GRANDMOTHER IS A TRILLION YEAR AND WILL HAVE SEX WITH HER.HE WOULD HAVE TO BUY THE [...] COMPANY,FOR SURE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Not as funny as the others,I thought this season wasn't as funny as the previous seasons. While still entertaining the comentary was full of hostility.
4,GND4!,"Was the release date moved up or something? I picked up a copy of Season 4 this afternoon at the local music/movie store. I didn't see S4 when it originally aired, so these episodes are new to me. The show has lost a lot of its spark, but they are a few genuine moments."
1,Boring. Waste of money.,"These Season 4 DVDs are a waste of money. It's boring from the beginning till the end. There is no funny, no interesting scenes.I've should have rented it first."
3,Old Girlfriends Get No Respect,"I have all the other seasons and really like the commentary on those episodes. This is no exception. The girls talk about lots of things concerning when and how they left the mansion and Hef. Kendra talks about Hank and who she's inviting to the wedding. Bridget talks some about her beach series. All of them, especially Holly, have less than flattering comments about the new girls. It's not too catty, but if you've followed the girls for all 4 seasons, it will give you some closure. As to the quality of the set, I ordered on that came with a broken case. Amazon replaced it quickly with another copy also broken. Cheap plastic quality it the reason. I just repaired the 2nd one with duct tape and kept it."
5,girls next door,"i love the girls next door. 4 and 5 were purchased to finish out my library. Love this show. I miss them alot. i wish they never left the mansion. When those twins were on, they were awful and you notice now the show is not even on any more. there will never be a replacement for the girls next door with kendra, holy and bridget.. fun, exciting and sexy."
3,Not true to the written play,"The performances in this are spectacular. Shange's poetry comes alive.However, there are two problems I have with this. First, is that one of the poems is left out entirely (latent rapist). Second, they have men in the film that speak some of the words. I think the power of ""for colored girls"" comes from the words only coming from women, since this play is for girls from women's mouths.Still an amazing piece of artistry, and better than not seeing it live at all."
3,I like it,I like the movie but I think maybe i need to watch it again(without distractions) lol but Lynn whitfield and Alfre Woodard did a great job...the video is enjoyable :)
5,Classic literature,"Anyone who considers themselves to be a theatre aficionado should be familiar with this piece. This work never gets old, it's a wonderful presentation on the Black experience from a woman's perspective. Reading is great, seeing it is better. If you're a Black actress, it should unquestionably be on your shelf."
4,4 Colored Girls Broadway Version/Play,"This was excellent to look at, and see the cast and how they started out (in their 20's) and it was cool to see how the original version was, versus the newer version with Janet Jackson, etc."
5,Dr.Hook lifts some years!,I am still an oldie but goodie and Dr Hook on tape goes with me in the pick-up. Lifts my spirits and years.
5,It is a good supplement to another course.,This book is chocked full of information. This book is not intended to be a phrase book and it's entire emphasis is the unique sentence structure that the Romanian language requires.I recently had one of the books I authored translated into Romanian by the Sibiu Monetary Financial Commodities Exchange. This was a book that one of the translators recommend to me and I was not disappointed.
1,Not enough material for a grammar,"This book just has very little stuff. On one hand it is a grammar for beginners, on the other, many words are not translated. One must read it with a dictionary. But then why bother?"
1,blah,"After 30 minutes of wearing in lab, they hurt and were extremely uncomfortable. I had to buy another brand of goggles."
2,Cheap but uncomfortable,I bought this for my Chemistry class since you are obliviously required to have one when you are in the laboratory but they are really uncomfortable when you put them on. I constantly tried adjusting them because they really hurt. The only reason why I bought them was because of the price but I regret buying them. I think I could have spent a little bit more on something a little bit better.
4,"Riveting, alarming, encouraging...","What a great book! It could be subtitled: ""The Evil that Men Do."" All true, all alarming, sometimes downright shocking stories of citizens who fought back. It's great to see the good guys win and the bad guys get what they deserve!! From the postal-ex-employee, to the estranged lover, to the random breaking and entering, this is a must-read, especially if you live in a concealed carry state."
5,A must-read--simultaneously terrifying and empowering.,"""The Best Defense"" is a wake-up call for those who are either complacent or over-confident in matters of self-defense. The book starkly illustrates the high-degree of viciousness that characterizes violent criminal attacks, as well as the incredibly brave, tough, and often desperate actions taken by ordinary armed citizens in successful self-defense. ""The Best Defense"" is a must-read for anyone willing to use a firearm in defending their children, their wife, or themselves from a lethal criminal assault."
4,The final word,I feel this is the final word in the gun control debate. This is what we the legitimate gun owners have needed. Some proof that packing heat is the best way to deter crime and to keep yourself and your loved ones alive.
2,A capable but hard to use product,"this product has tons of features but it was not nearly as easy to use as I had hoped. The interface was confusing, the interaction methods are completely foreign to the Mac. I've been using Macs since '85 and I've used hundreds of different programs. Most have a somewhat familiar feel to them, even if you DO have to read the book to use advanced features. This one was so weird I couldn't even draw a line without reading the manual first."
2,Not for Everyone,"Tough learning curve. Still practicing. I am pretty good with computers, but you almost have to be a computer architech to use this software efficiently."
5,A Great Product!,"This software is incredible. Although I have seen some reviews that it is difficult to get the hang of, it really is easy to use if you are familiar with other graphic design programs. The ability to quickly do design work and then see what it looks like in 3D and in real time is remarkable. There are things that can be improved upon, and hopefully will, but this is tough to beat for the money if you are a Mac user."
1,WLG,"Pretty much a worthless piece of software. Kitchen design does not work, and trying to rotate anything takes way too many steps. Save your money and buy something else."
3,Cher - A Primer for those under 30,"The price of this CD alone was worth the price to show my younger friends (I am 45) that the 1991 version of Bang Bang was NOT the first. You Better Sit Down Kids also brings back memories. Because of the subject matter (divorce) my folks told me in 1966 or 1967 that I could not buy the record. Well Mom and Dad....it took 35 years, but I now bought it."
2,Not very pleased,"Recently bought the cd and was thoroughly disappointed. Same old 80's beats throughout most of the album. Only worthwhile song comes from the album's title, Savoir Aimer. Personally, I'm waiting for his ""best of"" cd if it hasn't come out already. I considered his live cd, but I prefer studio recordings anyday."
4,Sore the Next Day Workout!,"I thought this dvd was fast paced and a complete, sweaty workout. Almost as challenging as Tae Bo, but I did enjoy using weights part of the workout. I'm not that out of shape but boy was I sore for the next 3 days, good and challenging dvd to switch off with in your workout routine."
4,A really good workout!!!,"I bought this video based on what others had to say about it and I must agree that this is one of the best workout videos I have. It will definately get your heart rate up and you will definately be sweating by the end. The instructor is fun and motivating, not annoying. I would definately reccomend this video."
2,Not Enjoyable and No explanations,"Why I don't like this video:1) Ellen Barrett doesn't explain the proper forms2) The model on the cover isn't the one in the exercise video (that bothers me, like they lied or something and she's in better shape than anyone in the video)3) Its 45 minutes long and I generally like 30 minute workouts. It could have been organized in better increments.4) The girl on the left of Ellen Barrett has a forced fake smile throughout the video. You can see her on the back of the dvd cover. Scary.5) Ellen Barrett is not very personable6) A lot of the moves do not have smooth transitions7) She doesn't give you time to learn the move. She just starts doing it without telling you how.8) This video is obsessed with HOPPING. Yes, they LOVE TO HOP in this video. And i hate hopping.For all these reasons, I will probably1) Throw away the dvd2) Donate the dvd"
4,great cardio,"I really enjoy the cardio in this workout. It really works up a good sweat. I usually do the cardio and the total body turnaround. The toning section is very challenging, but only works biceps and shoulders. It seems like too much to me. I prefer more variety when toning upper body. Altogether, I think its a great workout. I workout with several different videos and try to fit this one in atleast once a week. This is the only video with Ellen Barrett that I have and she does a great job cueing. I am very interested in working out with more of her videos."
4,very effective workout,"I really enjoyed this workout! Its quick (just over 30 minute) but I really felt like a got a total body workout! I love the variety in the routine, such as the use of ballet inspired moves. While it may not be good for those who are really advanced, this is a great workout for beginners and intermediates! Keep up the good work Self!"
4,I liked it...,"It was fun like the first ten times, but it does get old. It also does get you sweating though. I still do it from time to time."
2,Too Repetitive,Went into this workout with full energy but after a few minutes found myself bored. There is just too much dull repetition!! It would be ok if the moves were challenging but marching on the spot gets old. Could be good for lazy workouts/ beginners I suppose...
3,Not slim or sleek,"This is a typical excercise workout. I was hoping for something that would help me shed some pounds quickly. This is not the video that I needed to buy. I found some of the hula videos much more interesting but I do have a hard time staying focused. If you are into straight exercise dvd's then this is for you. However, if you are looking for something a little different...don't buy this one."
1,not good,I LOVE HER BIKINI READY FAST VIDEO BUT THIS ONE IS NOOOOOOO GOOD. IT SEEMS SHE JUST WENT ALONG AS THEY WERE RECORDING HER...MAYBE GOOD FOR BEGINNERS BUT RENT OR BORROW IT BEFORE YOU DECIDE TO BUY IT........
4,Another great Ellen Barrett workout,"I bought this DVD solely for Ellen Barrett. She is great, she cues well, she is motivating, has a pleasant voice and knows her stuff! The DVD could have been longer and could have been more well-rounded, but all in all, you get a decent, quality workout. She does a great job with introducing new moves and using repetition for perfecting the form. I particularly liked the ballet segment. I use this between my more difficult Janis Saffell DVD's, so it really is enough of a workout. The bonus could have been longer, but Ellen does suggest that you do it 2-3 times, not just once. I would have given this 5 stars if it was a longer workout."
4,Solid Workout,"I rely heavily on reviews when I buy something, so I figured I'd add my two cents in here. This is a basic workout. Nothing too fancy, no advanced moves, but you will feel it.This is not the DVD you do every day, but it's great to have in your library. I like the mix of cardio and weights. Ellen does call things by their ""ballet names"" which can be confusing at first (like I know what a side imprint is?), but once you get over that, it's fine. Also, unlike some instructors I've seen, Ellen is not annoying. To me, that's huge. One of the Firm instructors drives me crazy and I can't do her tapes at all!I would like it better if there was a clearer basic vs. advanced, so you could start out at one point with the DVD and progress to something more difficult, but I guess that's why you have more than one DVD in your collection!"
3,not quite efficient,"I bought this DVD and worked on it for about 2 weeks. I felt my muscles at the first 2 days then it was too easy. Maybe not the perfect DVD for being ""slim and sleek""."
4,This Workout is upbeat,I selected this dvd because I've enjoyed the other SELF dvd's and this one didn't disappoint. It starts out with a great warm up and dance inspired moves then moves into 2 high engery segments that make you sweat. I would recommend this dvd to everyone because I've made it a part of my regular routine.
3,Decent workout,"I bought this DVD together with Self's Bikini Ready Fast. I would recommend this workout only to beginners, it's really too easy and not nearly long enough (only 35 min. of actual workout including warm-up and cool-down)if you've been working out for awhile. That being said, it is a great workout for beginners or someone who hasn't worked out in a while. It helped me get back in shape (along with Bikini Ready) enough to transition back to The Firm (the best DVD workout as far as I'm concerned). Hope that's helpful."
4,Good Though Dated Intro History,"This book, published originally in the 1950s, is a general overview of the time period of the Russian Revolution, starting with the births of Czar Nicholas II and Vladimir Lenin in the late 19th century. It then covers the history from the point of view of the czarists and the communists. It touches on major historical figures, and gives a lay down of what social conditions were like immediately prior to the revolutions both of 1905 and 1917. It stops in mid-1917, and so doesn't cover the civil war. The author determined that this rich history laid outside the scope of what he intended to describe.This is a good though perhaps dated general history. It would be good as an introductory for students looking to learn more about the time period, though there is more recent scholarship out there. It also occasionally flashes Cold War paranoia and pretensions, especially in overly general descriptions of Russian society. Nevertheless, this book is worth the read."
3,"Good prose, but information is dated","Very straightforward, well-written account of the Russian Revolution. Note that it only covers the period up to the treaty of Brest-Litovsk, not delving into the civil war that followed. That said, this work is a little dated, but still a good overview of a very compelling story"
3,New interesting pics from *Nam,"This book contains nice photos I've never seen before & they're interesting.The downside is the quality of the prints;I have seen many of the more familiar photos with better standards of printing.In my opinion it is worth buying,although the abovementioned thing is a bit disturbing."
1,Indecipherable,"I swear this book is written in some ancient sumerian dialect. Maybe it would be helpful if it were in English, but I can't really say."
4,Great reference!,I used this book a tremendous amount in Anatomy 1. It was not a required book for the course but I would use it often when I needed clarification on certain muscles or ligaments etc. The sketches are great!
3,good book,"This is an okay book for dissection of large animals. I wish it had more pictures, but the ones that are there are helpful."
4,This was a mesmerizing book.,"This book was one that I enjoyed very much and read quickly. I couldn't put it down! I originally purchased this book because my family and I visited St. Helena Island, a Sea Island with much Gullah tradition, last year and loved it. I thought this book would be a way to learn more about the culture of the Sea Islands and get a good story out of it at the same time. It turned out to be so much more than that. Julie Dash does a masterful job of weaving Amelia's story into those of her mother and grandmother who have left the Island and moved to New York City to escape the ""backwards"" island culture. Amelia comes to love and appreciate her family and the rich heritage of her ancestors. This book was enriching both from a literary and cultural standpoint. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good ""coming of age"" novel."
4,Nice book for whole families to explore together.,"I am not much of a novel reader but I bought Daughters of the Dust because I am vacationing in the Sea Islands later this year. I found the stories to be captivating and descriptive of a life so different but somehow connected to my own. The pictures that Julia Dash painted of the island, the sounds and smells that she conjured up, and the feelings that she evoked made me feel almost as though I were there. This book is much better, more understandable than the movie. I highly recommend it for any family to read together, especially African American families with teenage girls."
4,Bluebird Cafe,"The Bluebird Café's protagonist is clearly the island state of Tasmania and the fictional city (original and recreation) of Copperfield--although it's the depiction of the real places of Tasmania that make this book so entertaining. It uses a disjointed narrative structure similar to Illywhacker and The Beautiful and the Damned but not as expertly. In this case, the unusual structure hinders an otherwise interesting story."
3,Decent suit for the money,"Here is the basic info - 90% Wool, 10% Cashmere, nice blend, nice materials, drapes nicely, it's a decent suit for under one fifty... original price of over five hundred wouldn't be worth it.Now the bad - it's not athletic fit or slim fit. It looks like a beer keg when it's on. If you have a big gut and small shoulders, this is the suit for you. If you spend any time in the gym, this thing won't do anything for you. Also the pants ARE pleaded, not flat front. Just one plead, but still not flat front.Overall it's a nice suit, but the cut doesn't work for people with small waist and big shoulders. Also sizes run big.. if you are 42 normally, you might want to get 40... Pants on 42 came as 36W, however, they are more of a 34W I would say, not terribly bad, however, still way too big for anyone that has 42 size jacket."
4,Good job but reversed priorities,"""There But For Fortune"" does a good job of presenting the perimeters of Phil Ochs, a useful piece of film for neophytes and others who will enjoy some unseen footage. The ""problem"" with the piece is prioritizing the times in which Ochs lived rather than a more detailed view of the man himself. While Phil, and all other historical figures for that matter surely reflect the times of which they shape their legacies,this film spends more time, footage, and analysis of the times themselves, rather than the man. A deeper look into this enigmatic figure would have been more useful for those seeking answers and explanations. A film certainly worth viewing, but a lesser story than could have been presented."
5,It's about time,"Absolutely wonderful, a realistic look at a difficult time and a complex artist. No punches pulled, no undo glory heaped, just an objective focus on the time and the man. So few know the contributions of Ochs, the scores of songs that still ring with relevance today, but those who do, have been waiting for this biography for a long, long time, and to have it come together so poignantly, so passionately, is a gift.Tough times require tough people, and Phil was one of them... for a while. My son watched the video and commented about how much we really need this guy today. Phil must be smiling somewhere, I know I did."
4,Very good documentary on Phil Ochs,Very interesting story. Definitely worth watching and well put together. Enjoyed it and added it to my library.First saw it on American Masters and then made my purchase.
5,Baby boomer subset,"Having lived thru these times,I found the documentary mirroring the first 25 years of my life.it is a prize possession ."
4,Why didn't anyone interview Sammy Walker?????,"Phil discovered Sammy Walker and took him under his wing during his last few years. Sammy is still alive and well in North Carolina; not that hard to find. He could've provided crucial insights on Phil's decline and the good times they shared.You'll hear Phil singing a little of Sammy's ""Song For Patty"" as he walks down a street clowning around, talking about Barricade Records..."
2,"Old b/w ""SILENT"" movie","Don't be fooled by the movie poster/cover -- this is a black and white film and a SILENT movie at that! Although the music played throughout the movie isn't what you might expect for a silent picture, it was hardly worth listening to.If you are in the mood to watch a silent film - there is some entertainment value in this. However, unless you are in the mood to watch an old silent film, you will probably want to skip this movie and seek a remake of the story."
3,Lousy shipping,"This CD is a typical wonderful Danny O'Keefe collection. What I am extremely disappointed is the condition that the case arrived in. It was broken and I had to sacrifice another case from a CD to get this one corrected. I left feedback to the shipper and they, of course, didn't bother to contact me."
3,A Paine to Read,"The information in this book is accurate and useful, if you can get past the writer's style. Maybe it has something to do with the British style. On the other hand, the price is good. Just don't expect an enjoyable learning experience."
2,A better book?,Currently using this book in a theory class. There must be a better theory book out there. Bounces form one theory to another while covering a specific theory in a chapter. It is hard for a person unfamiliar with theories to understand what is relevant to the theory named in that chapter heading.
1,YIKES,"This book is extremly dry. My graduate school professer HATED it, as did the rest of my class. Do not reccomend for a Human Behavior/Social Environment class!"
4,Covers a lot of early history,Excellent coverage of the early years of comics and graphic novels. This documentary is from 1988 so it is gratifying to see some of the greats here before they died.
1,Comic Book Confidential..What Happen...?,"The Film opens up good with a short history on the industry,there is some interviews on there with Legends such as Stan Lee and Eisner, and you have frank miller thrown in. But the film became more of a social commentary on censorship and a bunch of obscure comicbooks and their creators. I like the Golden age stuff,I was excited to see it on Netflix because of Stan Lee but this focuses too much on ""fighting the Man"" and the system. I am in it to see comic books not a bunch of washed up leftists spewing their propaganda from their comfy lofts in San Francisco.I prefer Stan Lee Mutants and Monsters than this. And I was Born after 1980 but I appreciate the Golden Age and not some obscure basement hippie stuff."
2,Very Mediocre,"I find it difficult to believe this could be rated highly.The second track, ""Totally Miss You"" is quite good. Most of the rest is very uninspiring indeed: ""House of Silence '99"" is just one of many examples of poor tracks.Rather gratuitously, the band members bear uncanny resemblances to nightclub bouncers."
2,Early Edition,"When I received this book I found out it was the 1847 edition of just over 100 pages ending at chapter IV. The product was not the 1858 edition of over 300 pages ending with chapter XI.If you are interested in the 1847 edition, the reproduction is a high quality and relatively clear reproduction of an old book."
5,Chase chases out laughter spit after spit after spit,"That means almost every time he says something to someone about something he's talking about. one can not help but laugh. he's brilliant in the Vacation movies too. I have this on dvd and love it. the actors and actresses are amazing. I really like the movie in whole. and would recommend it to anyone that likes Chevy Chase.I could watch this again and again and again and say "" that's so funny I just split my sides"" that's how great this movie is"
3,Cottage Humor,"There never is a farm unless a couple of ducks in a nearby pond qualify. It's about a couple of city folk who decide to live in a cottage in the country and find things different. Throw in some screwball incidents like the corpse buried on their plot and turning the whole local village into a Norman Rockwell picture and you have the gist of what this is all about! Naturally, Chevy Chase plays Chevy Chase the writer with a writers block, or a journalist with writer aspirations and wife who can, write, which busts his ego. There are two dogs which have minor parts. The scenary is nicely captured in film and there is a Christmasy feel towards the end - 'tis the season!"
3,Mellow comedy,"Starts a little slow, but picks up over time. Make sure you are not expecting roll on the floor laughter, it never comes. But, you'll find that it is mildly amusing. My favorite scenes: the movers and ""Mac"", the movers and the bridge, the sign-stealing kids, and of course the ""Lamb-Fries"". Madelaine Smith-Osborne and Chevy Chase may not light up the screen, but they are believable in the serious scenes, of which there are only a few. Not a smash, but a cute film."
1,The only accurate word in the title is Farm,"As in it took place on a farm, and was so crappy it could be used as fertilizer on a farm.If you accidentally pick this movie up at a rental store, wash your hands ASAP. If you are forced to watch it for any reason, just remember who did it to you on that list of grievances you keep. If you can make it through without projectile vomiting, you are a better man than I."
4,Throughly entertaining,Chevy always tickles your funny bone. He is in great form in this movie on the surprises of moving from the city to the country. He is supported by a great cast.
5,A FUN FAMILY FAVORITE,"There are few movies that spark such spontaneous laughter and gut-wrenching humor as Funny Farm. Chevy Chase is a comedic genius and the writers of this movie have not missed a beat including the ""aberant"" dog patterns of farm/rural living. This movie is filled with characters that even if you haven't encountered them personally, you can belly laugh with the best of them! Don't miss out on this family classic!!"
5,funny farm,"the movie is really funny, and fresh,never boring . the stars make the movie.it is one of many movies ,that I would watch over and over again."
5,Love This Movie,"I have always loved this movie and so has my dad, so that's why I wanted to get this for him for Christmas. The shipping was fast and product in great shape. We watched the dvd a few days after Christmas and loved it. No scratches or glitches while watching movie. Great movie!"
5,Awesome,"Had a great time watching Funny Farm, had a great experience with Amazon. I always use Amazon when purchasing movie or books. Will purchase items again from Amazon."
3,bad timing,"Sometimes a comedy has the timing and sometimes it doesn't, unfortunately, Funny Farm doesn't have it. I was disappointed after all of the great reviews. The few laughs were hit and miss and I kept waiting for a good punch line and climax to the movie. Never happened. If you want a funny movie buy For Richer or for Poor. Fun movie all the way through."
4,FUNNY FARM,"Funny Farm DVD. This movie was recommended by a friend to explain the ""natives"" in our area. I'm looking forward to watching this because living here is an ""experience""."
5,fuuny farm,it arrive in good shape and recommed to all my friends and family love this movie very much and very funny
3,Not Chevy Chase's best performance.....,"...but this movie does have it's moments. Chevy decides to move to the country to write his novel, and immediately things begin to go awry...slow in places but plenty of antics typical of Chevy Chase."
2,Not exactly funny,"Funny Farm has mixed reviews because thats what kind of a movie it is. It looks like the film starts out funny with the movers, then you meet the old guy who gives poor directions in his rocking chair, then the cop who rides in a taxi cab, then there is Chevy Chase and his wife. The first 25-30 minutes are pretty amusing then the movie looses its touch and gets dull and slows down. The interesting characters seem to leave the movie the movers are gone and even the funny cop leaves the movie. You are left with a drunk mailman and Chevy Chase and his wife. Overall there is nothing really funny in this movie its not fall to floor humor where you will be laughing so hard you'll start crying, its nothing like that I give it two stars because it does follow some sort of a story line but like I said its not a thrilling ride of laughter there is some humor here and there."
3,Profanity-,"This is a funny movie that could be for the whole family if it was not spoiled by profanity. It is rated PG, which I guess allows for profanity."
1,"Silly, shallow, boring",I made myself finish watching the movie hoping it would get better. It didn't. I didn't laugh once. What a waste of time.
1,funny farm,"I never recieved the item ordered 12/14; ""lost in the mail"". But when I e-mailed you after waiting 3 weeks for delivery, another was sent express mail and I recieved it in 3 days. Very nice customer service. thanks"
5,Classic,I think I have now seen this movie about 40 times. I just had to buy it on DVD since my VCR has died.I have even had a dog and named it Yellow Dog LOL.Very much worth the watch. Classic.
4,A great dramedy,"You know, I haven't seen this movie in a long while and I purchased it recently. I think this is one of the most underrated Chevy Chase movies that seems to get overlooked. It's a great story, resembling ""The Money Pit"". It also has a Christmas theme and that seems to get overlooked when cable is playing holiday movies at the end of the year.Give this one a try, might surprise you."
5,Funniest movie ever,If you just want to watch a good clean movie with the family that will keep you laughing the whole movie this is it. No matter how many times I watch this I spend the movie laughing.
5,Funny Farm DVD,This is about my all-time favorite movie. I count it as a Christmas movie as it all culminates at Christmas. I love the house in the country where the couple ends up. I love Chevy Chase and Madolyn Smith and all the other characters. I love the story premise. Sometimes I'll get done watching it and start it all over again. You did a good job getting the DVD out to us. Appreciate doing business with you folks.Joyce Corey
3,"""How'd You Know My Name Is Mac?""","""Funny Farm"", is not quite Chevy Chase's best. It certainly not my favorite movie that he stars in, but it has it's moments: A corpse in the garden, a madman for a mailman, a bird outside Andy Farmer's window which always distracts him from typing and a fishing trip gone completely wrong all in a humerous way. Those are just some samples. When Andy Farmer moves into the country, the 2 movers get very lost on the way, no thanks to a collapsed bridge. His wife also writes a novel about squirrels, and she buys a stuffed squirrel at an antique store which inpired her. {Not to mention everything in the store belonged to the relatives of the woman who owned the place}. The entire movie is in Chevy Chase's silly style, but just not his best. It still had it's moments, though."
2,"""Not Very"" Funny Farm","I had heard excellent reviews about this movie, and I gave it a shot. To be honest, it was less than funny. I figured I was in trouble after the first ""joke"" was just plain stupid. There were a few moments where I did laugh, but they were few (Irish Setter, Dog Tail in Fireplace). About halfway through the movie, it was as if the writer forgot that it was intended to be a comedy. I don't recall even smiling, let alone laughing, during the second half of the movie, and the ending is less than comedic. The DVD was nothing special, either: no good extras or features.To sum it up, this is a movie I think you can do without. I would not recommend it."
3,One of Chevy Chase's Better Comedies!,"""Funny Farm"" is a good Chevy Chase comedy for the whole family (as long as you can tolerate a little foul language) and probably Chase's best performance this side of the first ""Vacation"" and his greatest performance in ""Fletch"". The plot is believable, the gags work, and the tone of the movie is pleasant. Recommended."
5,Sarah Michelle Gellar?,"Chevy Chase and Madolyn Smith bring lots of laughter into this film, its very funny and entertaining but why was there so little of Sarah Michelle Gellar is the film, the film is one her filmography and box office data but we hardly see her, she simply wasn't there, a big disappoinment but the movie still deserves a 4/5."
4,Just a Pleasure to Watch,"Let me say that I'm not a big Chevy Chase fan - but I like this movie. The story of a couple, Andy and Elizabeth Farmer, who move from the daily grind of New York to the picturesque country setting of Rosebud, only to find their scenic utopia populated by a pack of small town lunatics.There are some truly funny moments: the cackling, alcoholic mailman who never stops; the bid to sell the house (cue the deer); the casket in the garden... it all works and provides for a good movie from beginning to end."
3,Funny Farm,"This movie was made when Chevy Chase was doing some of his best work. Unfortunately this was not the best example of it. It was entertaining and had some funny moments, but there are better movies that showcase his comedic genius such as Fletch.I have added this to my Christmas collection as the scenes they did for the holidays were a scream! With all the amazing supporting characters, I expected more from the film than I got."
4,"Bad title, good film","Didn't the producers know that comedies with the word ""funny"" in the title often don't do well at the box office? Add to that a horrible print campaign (Chevy Chase with a cracked egg on his face), and it's not hard to see why this movie bombed. And that's too bad, because I think this is one of Chevy Chase's best movies.This is a classic ""fish out of water"" movie, with the twist being that it's not the fish that's bad, it's the water. Chase and his wife try to escape the crazy life of the city by moving to the country, only to find that life on the farm is not all it's cracked up to be. Think Norman Rockwell after smoking five joints!The tone of this movie is more laid back than the Vacation series and other Chase movies, but easily finds its own pace. Probably the last really funny movie that Chevy Chase made."
1,Magnetic Maze a disappointment,Although rated for 2 year olds I found that the magnetic wand was too narrow and small and not strong enough to really attach to the little ball inside the maze. It is even hard for adults and was totally frustrating - and not fun - for my 2 1/2 year old.
2,Practical Case Analysis,This book was rated very good but it had numerous highlighted sections. I would not have rated it like it was. I was disappointed.
5,very sweet story,I bought this for my granddaughter - her mother's name is Amanda & her baby brother Oliver so this book connected us in 3 ways.
3,An O.K book,"Grandmother is no fun. She can't read to Amanda because she keeps losing her glasses, and she can't help Oliver build with blocks because she can't sit on the floor. But she can tell stories,and sing songs... and soon Oliver, Amanda and Grandmother Pig are the best of Friends!!"
4,Never mind,"The second 'A Customer' has cut and paste some utter garbage. Anyway...I too was a massive Roogalator fan, seeing them countless times from the Bass Boy days, and on to the band he had with Michael Parker on second guitar. For you Cincinnati residents, I believe Adler is back in Ohio and involved in train restoration projects - All Aboard!This seems a pretty decent comp. Get this and his post-Roogalator Gusha Gusha Music album."
5,Best book I've read this year!,"I can't say enough good things about this book. Lee Stringer writes with compassion and understanding of the street life yet writes without need of pity or apology. If you haven't already read this book, do so. It's well worth the read."
4,An Honest Book,"Lee Stringer was a self-confessed crackhead. He lived on the streets of New York City for almost ten years before he was finally able to kick his habit and return to what most of us would consider a normal life. However, don't feel sorry for Mr. Stringer. He doesn't want your pity or need it. Even while living the life of a junkie he was able to maintain his dignity and humanity. He paints an honest picture of life on the streets as he hustled to find enough redeemable aluminum cans to pay for his next dime bag of crack. You may not like everything that Mr. Stringer has to tell you, but what he says will open your eyes."
4,"Entertaining stories, gripping social commentary","Stringer's stories are gripping, they illustrate that the desperate and homeless are just like you and me, except they are desperate and homeless. -Just Kidding-I highly reccomend it."
1,Terrible.......,This was the worst book I ever read.I thought the story was going to be about the homeless in Grand Central.Yet all themain character Lee talks about is his work with a newspaperwritten by the homeless.The book drags on and on going nowhere.The characters Lee mentions in the book are as dull as the bookitself.I was trully disappionted.The only thing this book is goodfor is putting you to sleep.
3,It could have been much more,"I stuck the book out for about 2/3 of it always hoping for some point to be made from the various unconnected stories he tells, but most have no point or real end...such as the story of the blonde hooker who becomes central to his life for many months or the even less understandable the defrocked Greek priest who wants to be in the newspaper.Very little of this book is about how it is to be homeless or to sleep under subway tunnels etc. It's mostly about his hustling newspapers and cans and taking drugs,but even that is surface level & not very detailed."
4,Good Read,I heard Lee Stringer tell one of the stories from his book on the Moth and was intrigued. I enjoyed reading this book and gaining the perspective it gave of people we see but know little about. Very interesting and entertaining stories - all true.
5,Putting Life Into Focus,"Stringer paints a vivid image of the ""down and out"" in Grand Central Winter. People opposed to helping the homeless could benefit from reading this piece. Contrary to popular belief, not all of the homeless are without ambition and the desire to succeed. Stringer portrays this as he presents an almost eloquent account of his own troubles and fight to overcome the odds. Some would argue that living in a big city desensitizes people to the degree that they are drawn away from humanity. Grand Central Winter actually brought me, the reader, closer to my own."
1,Revisionist History,"This is propaganda to the far-right wing that wrote it, at best. In our earliest documents, our founders proudly declare that we are NOT a Christian nation (the most well-known example of this being the Treaty of Tripoli.) We were never declared as a Christian nation until an ex-governor of Missouri was the first public figure to call us such - and in case you are not aware, Missouri was the 24th state in country that was founded with only 13. It's a fact that a country itself does not hold religious beliefs, and while there is Christian heritage, there is also Freemason heritage, strong atheistic heritage, Muslim heritage, and Jewish heritage. This book stretches the truth on almost every page to make its illogical, flawed argument and fails hard in the end."
5,Can't Wait To Get Carried Away On Blu Ray!!!!,"I've held back from buying the complete series box set on regular dvd, because its just a matter of time for this wonderful collection to be released!!!i CANNOT wait. I've signed up to be notified because i will purchase that set in a heart beat!!!!"
1,FAKE,unfortunately you cant give 0 or negative stars but DO NOT BUY THIS EXPECTING TO GET THE REAL SONG BY THE ARTIST LISTED. THESE ARE COVERS.... CRAPPY COVERS!! I WANT MY 89 CENTS BACK!!!!!!!!!!!
3,"Informative, but low quality","The information contained in this video is very helpful to someone preparing to attend a job/career fair. However, the visual quality is mediocre at best. There are times when you can barely see what's going on, unless you turn your brightness settings all of the way up on your TV or computer monitor. Not something you would want to display to a group, but something that might be more effective as an audio feed."
1,absolute garbage,"By FAR the worst baseball video game I've ever played. There's really no excuse. It looks like one of the games from the original NES, except without the enjoyable gameplay.Don't waste your time or your money."
1,! WARNING ... WARNING ... WARNING ! read fine print,"Warning, the game you are thinking about buying is NOT a game. At least is should'nt be. I have never seen such butchering of baseball or video games. I have been playing games for 20 years now and have never seen a peice of junk like this. I have played better on the SNES! Well here is the review...-PROS-N/A-CONS-* No season mode* Bad players are good, good players are bad* Will not remind you of America's favorite pasttime* Everybody looks the same* BAD gameplay* When a pitching change is made, for example, a righty stays a righty even if you bring in a lefty.* You have to swing way before you can tell what the pitch is* It has Derek Jeter on the coverSo to sum it all up, DON'T BUY THIS GAME!!!if you do, buy two of them. one to s*it on and one to cover it up with."
3,Review from a baseball fan,"If you play it a lot, you will get the hang of it and then start having fun. The playoffs are harder than the regular games. The umpires make bad calls sometimes which is frustrating. It might be best for someone who is 9 years or older."
1,Rated this high because there are no other choices,"I wasn't fooled by Derek's picture on the cover; I knew what I was getting into...the worst baseball game ever. Then why did I by it? It's baseball season and there is nothing out there now or seemingly on the horizon.It's a pick up and play game and since you can't save, you can use it to fill in any old time spot you have in your calendar. The only reason to write is to offer a challenge...give us a worth while, sound baseball game. Feel free to charge $ 40.00."
5,Lanquedoc delight,"I have not yet received it!!! However, I have previously read it and recommend it as highly entertaining, educational, and just wish we'd known more about the region when we stayed there."
1,Terrible writing. Unbelievable characters.,I was fairly disappointed with this book. Many of the reviews were quite positive but i found this book almost unreadable. Whoever their editor is did a terrible job. The story does not flow well and the characters say the most unbelievable things. It seems as though the author was pushing his characters in an unnatural direction.
2,Just Average,"I found this book a little tough going, and really not that funny. It was not nearly as good as ""A year in Provence"". The charachters are shallow andpredictable, and the book is monotonous."
3,"It's Called the Record Industry, Folks...","There's far too much moaning about how DOA have remixed several titles to death! Oh, it IS so very true, my dears.BUT, let's not forget that DOA are signed to a whole list of record companies, each in different countries -- and these companies, what do THEY want? Money. It's no surprise Cleopatra (DOA's US label) are no different -- they want to cash in on these very popular songs, as well.As far as new material, don't worry -- rumors abound that a new album called ""Sayonara,Sugarpie"" is in the can (for release in Japan, first, from what I understand) and from Pete's own mouth came the news that DOA plan to re-record most of their singles (including the ones from the early days -- as in 1981 early -- I heard it with my ears on a French interview) and release them as a Greatest Hits package. More to moan about? Ah, well...Bottom line? Be paitient. Meanwhile, buy this and drive those around you mental with all 700 mixes of YSMR.Cheers!"
3,Remix Double singles...,I only bought this for the #1 & #3 versions of the second song. I really really didn't like the remixes on here of YSMR. I'm very perfectly happy w/the 2 on Youthquake. Those will always be my faves. These here are the same or boring or give me a headache. They're more for club dancing anyway. I really didn't like them or the other 3 versions of the second song-same problem. Boring to me. I like the radio edit & original versions here.
1,Just for people with a bad taste,"I was so happy when I saw that there is finally a remix cd of Dead or Alive's biggest hit single. But what did I have to listen to ? They are all lousy remixes. Most people could make better remixes with home computer equipment, no experience neccessary. The remixers had no idea of innovation and just thought about how to make quick money. Euro-dance pop has never been worse."
4,Ogilvie products are reliable,I have used Olgivie perms for years and can rely on them to curl just right. The last perm I had done at a beauty salon burnt my hair so bad and it was just a frizzy mess. Since then I have only used home perms and have found the Olgivie perms to be the best.
4,"the video above, is not in the dvd","this video that amazon shows u (people at hollywood sign) is NOT in the actual dvd, not even in the special features. i was kinda pissed about that because i thought the whole movie was going to be that way."
4,Documentarian or egomaniac?,"Exit Through the Gift Shophad us laughing out loud, and scratching our heads as a super graffiti fan and compulsive film maker took us on insane roof top adventures with the street artists of his dreams. He crosses the line, however, when he tries to become a street artist himself, forgetting the fact that nearly all ""his"" art is bitten from everyone he's ever idolized. The story is fascinating, and Banksy, himself a wry commentator. The film features amazing stencil graffiti by Banksy and wheat paste art by Obey."
5,"I Only Like A Handfull of Documentaries, And This is One of Them","Documentaries don't often thrill me - but this movie kept me more on the edge of my seat than most standard action films. I got to see one of Banksy's works while in Boston, and have since been very interested in the street art world. This movie does exactly what all documentaries should do - it gives you a first person immersion into a world that exists but most people don't even know is there. It's equal parts riveting and sad, but all together entertaining. You won't be able to look at a wall the same way again....and I mean that as a compliment."
3,bootleg.,The movie was good however if I would've known it was going to be a burned copy I would've bought it somewhere else.
2,RUN to the nearest exit!!,"Ostensibly a documentary about street art, ""Exit ..."" morphs into the story of a somewhat deranged poseur named Thierry who fancies himself a street artist after hanging out with a bunch of them. He re-invents himself as a ""M r. Brain Wash"" or MBW.The only ones brainwashed -- besides himself in his delusions of talent -- are the suckers paying $20,000 for this ""art"" (sic).The film evoked in me a ""Spinal Tap"" quality of the absurd, spotlighting relatively untalented folks who harbor delusions of grandeur and significance.Don't exit through the Gift Shop. RUN to the nearest exit, regardless of location...."
5,Greater Appreciation for Street Art,"There are three different stories going on here from what I recall. It's a pretty incredible documentary especially considering it all started by accident! Now, anytime I'm in a city admiring the graffiti I've got a new appreciation for it."
3,interesting,"Good documentary, albeit a thinly veiled attempt to discredit another artist. There was a lot of character bashing, which made for a less than pleasurable experience."
2,street art is great but someone else should have handled this material,"Banksy and some of the other street artists that the French guy captures on film are great and I esp enjoyed Banksy's willingness to be politically charged in Palestine nonetheless, but at the 1 hr mark when the French idiot faux raconteur tries to make his own art is when you can shut off the film."
2,A boring documentary on mental illness,Can I have that hour of my life back? I like eclectic and alternative movies. I did not like how this film was produced and how its protagonist is a man with mental illness being portrayed as some sort of fascinating enigma.
2,Dvd keep case edition,"The movie itself is great but this dvd edition is cheap, with no extras and distributed from Canada. You will not be happy with this dvd release. Hold out for the fold out edition that comes with sun glasses."
4,Required viewing for any artist...,"Exit Through the Gift Shop is a documentary accessible to both fans of street art and the uninitiated...in fact discovering that there is a world of art out there that still feels alive, fresh, and new makes this documentary recommendable and possibly even more exhilarating for individuals unfamiliar with the genre of street art.The documentary examines the very nature of what makes art...and delves into the not-so-pretty idea that peoples taste in art is driven by collective hype and monetary value...not the actual soul of the art. This is an eye opening film, and one that anyone even the least bit interesting in modern art should immediately flock to. 4.25/5."
3,Decent,"This movie was ok. I guess there is no way to know if it is real or a hoax. I wouldn't go around and recommend it and I wouldn't watch it again. It wasn't horrible but it is just one of those films where you won't ""miss out"" on anything if you never watch it."
5,Exit,"The movie was great and in good condition. I've had a good experience so far. Thank you, I love my new movie!"
3,Good information on espresso,"Kenneth Davids writes a lot of information on history and the art of making espresso coffee. The only thing that really bothered me was his method of writing. At times it was very clear, then it dropped off when it became more interesting, almost like ""running out of room."" The section on machines and equipment was fairly good, but it didn't give more details on each type of machine.The source section was very limited on where to buy machines or coffee. Could have been better at rating coffee and machines.The book was a little hard to read with very small type, and the monotone brown color of the illustrations."
3,An Overall Decent Cup of Coffee,"I found this book to have some valuable information, especially in regards to historical background on origins of the espresso machine. I must say that it did seem to be a bit outdated at times. I know the last published date was 2001, however, it felt like most of it was from the original 1993 edition. I live in Seattle now so even comments made back in 2001 are already outdated. The organization of the book is a little awkward at first and you will find some redundancy in content throughout the book (in particular information about types of machines).If you are looking for a book heavy in skills that will help to make you a better barista, whether profession or even skilled amateur at home, you will find some good tips in this book. However, I would instead highly recommend David Schomer's book Espresso Coffee: Professional Techniques, which is regarded by many as the barista bible."
4,Good Basic Introduction,This book gives a great basic introduction to espresso. It is not laden with jargon. Helps to take some of the mystique off of an often misunderstood coffee technique.
5,Black Masterpiece,"This is simply put, great! There are not very many people who understand Black Metal and thats ok. Who cares what they think, they are not used to this sort of genre and probably are afraid of it. I love N B M because its true, its not like Rise Against were they shout REBEL! Then they just sit there and want everyone else to do it for them. These fine muscians will do what they sing about. Lets kill People! They do it. Christianity in Norge is too controlling, so they burn churches. These people put their money were their mouth is and that is the most honest kind of music. Hail Norwegian Black Metal!"
4,Gorgoroth's awesome 1st attempt,"This is more primitive and ""true"" than their later albums. However, I would rate this as one of my favorite BM albums. The album closer, ""Maaneskyggens Slave"" is the best song on the album, and a preview of what is to come on ""Antichrist"", slower, more melodic black metal. Standouts on the album include ""Begravelsesnatt"", ""Drommer om Dd"", and ""Katharinas Bortgang""."
1,a bit of a disapointment,"I am a big Carrie Rezabek fan. I have done Pershing Square 1 and 2 100 times in the last 10 months! I was so looking forward to this new release. There is a long section on your knees which I find impossible to do. I am an intermediate /advanced exerciser and I find this very painful to do on your knees, I'll be in pain for days if I did this section."
4,Great Music...I heard it as a child...one of my favorites.,"If you are a Nat King Cole fan, you will most likely enjoy all the songs on this album. It is not a very long album though. However, there are songs on this album that are not on any other album. I extremely enjoy it."
5,Good sampling of 1950's Nat King Cole!,"Giving out 5 stars may seem a bit much considering there are cd's and albums out with many more songs. Still this album contains enough of Cole's material to satisfy the old time fans and to give new listeners a good sampling of Nat King Cole. Two of Cole's most well known songs, ""Mona Lisa"" & ""Unforgettable"", are on here. Other well known songs of the time period, such as ""Red Sails in the Sunset"" & ""(I Love You) For Sentimental Reasons"", will be recognized by almost all. So, the sampling of songs is good and the price is reasonable, I don't see how you can go wrong with this purchase. The only problem may be in obtaining a copy. It seems to drift in and out of availability."
2,toy,this item didn't work for us. It didn't stand up straight on one stroller and the straps were too small for the other one. It looked cute though.
3,World Traveller,"Again Jah Wobble plays his well travelled bass to display wordly knowledge of the low end. No long winded solos here, every note has it's place. all continents & hemispheres are well represented. Both dance & trance featured prominently. East meets West without cultural imperialism."
3,doesn't live up to expectation,After the brilliance of Killing Time I have waited and waited for something else from Tina Cousins. The release of her version of Wonderful Life as a single filled me with great hope but unfortunately this fails to live up to my expectations. It is good but barely a worthy successor to her previous work.
5,Eye catching and brilliant!,"I spotted this watch at a duty free shop at Dubai and it wouldn't let go until I owned it. It is very eye catching with a rectangular, yet curvy design. Black and silver with a polyurethane strap, it is rather chunky (which I like) yet I hardly notice it on my wrist.The numbers are a stylish silver-tone, the hands are luminous, the digital display can show time, date (which I've set mine to do), elapsed time, and an alarm. Setting is a breeze, just follow the instructions in the manual. Oh, and it is water resistant to 100 feet. I love it!"
4,very nice watch,"my wife got me this watch as a gift , and its really becoming one of my favorite watches. And trust me ,, i have plenty of good watches.u can wear this anytime anywhere , its elegant and sporty . dont get scared by its size, its very comfy. i luv this watch . However, it is not the best watch u could ever get. overall, i recommend it this watch"
2,Very plain watch,"Not to satisfied with this watch. Bought the watch for the digital, but thought the watch would be better looking than it is.Also the light for the digital is a waste!"
2,Not the Original Versions,"There is no greater fan of the Delfonics than I am. But if you're looking for the original version of these songs, this CD is not it. These are re-recordings by the Delfonics. Still smooth, but not the songs we listened to in the 60s and 70s. For their best greatest hits package buy ""The Delfonics Definitive Collection: La La Means I Love You.""And if you want to hear the Delfonics best album song for song buy their self-titled CD ""The Delfonics."" It contains the classic ""I Gave To You"" which unexplainably does not appear on the Definitive Collection."
2,Doesn't smell right. Must have changed the formula slightly.,"I have used this perfume for over 10 years. It used to be my sister's favorite. But this latest bottle smells not quite right. Too soft, if that makes sense?"
5,love it,This book is really hard but it is very useful to improve keyboard skill. The condition of book is perfect.
5,A great read in Spanish or English,"This is an relatively easy novel for those trying to improve their Spanish skills, as the mystery is the key element. Fast-paced and interesting. I loved it."
5,La Cena Secreta,This book keeps you entertained from beginning to end. I read it in Spanish although it is available in English. I like the way it unfolds and allows us to look deeper into Leonardo Da Vinci's work. An eye opening on the catars.
1,no shipment,"Apparently they didn't have the item in stock, but never let me know anything. Hope my fish don't die before a replacement can be found."
4,Enjoyable Small Group Swing,"Until I heard this cd, I never made the association of the similarities of playing and tone between Pete Fountain and Benny Goodman. I suppose this impression is further enhanced by some of the selections (""Oh, Lady Be Good"", ""Avalon"", ""Shine"" and ""Rosetta"" for example) and the small group consisting of unidentified xylophone (reminding me of Red Norvo), guitar, bass and drums.Except for two obvious selections , there is nothing to identify this with New Orleans but this is still a very enjoyable small group swing set."
2,He Who Hesitates (87th Precinct),"I actually gave up on this one. Most 87 Precinct books are very enjoyable, but I could not get into this one. I think this book must have been one of the first or an attempt to change styles by Ed McBain. This is the only book of his that I have read or partially read that I would rate as ""I don't like"". I have probably read over a dozen."
5,Open Mind,"I have had this book in my collection for 5 years. It does help if you have an open mind while reading it. This book is absolutely not about depleting the surrounding area of wildlife of all kinds for years & years. I think the author was trying to get this point across to the reader...modern hunting techniques will not work to your benefit in a ""Survival"" situation.(period) If you are interested in information & diagrams of: Snares, Traps, Urban survival, And collecting numerous animal foods & protecting yuorself in a ""Survival Poaching"" manner this book is for you."
4,This book has Plenty of useful information - for 1990,"This book is definitely an interesting read. It provides information on some of the different traps as well as what a poacher needs to do in order to avoid getting caught. It also has good information on how to build traps and snares. However, this book is kind of out of date. It instructs people on how to use two way radios instead of disposable prepaid cell phones to communicate. It also leaves out a technique I have seen rednecks use in the past for catching frogs. This technique is to use fishing gear with insect lures."
3,Eww!,"Not recommended for your average reader. Rather than title this ""Survival Poaching"", I'd call it more ""Criminal Poaching"". Lots of good survival techniques, but way too much on how to not get caught while knowingly breaking the law."
3,Not quite what I expected ...,"I had thought that this book would focus on ""survival methods"" for capturing game in emergencies. It does in a way, but it's real focus is purely on illegal taking of game, emergency or not. As such, it has a lot of attention on the ""how not to get caught"" -- this might be entertaining, but it's not what I had in mind, hence my lower rating. Still, not a bad book."
4,Practicle book,This book gives good information on how to trap a wide range of animals and while I doubt some of the traps work it is still a very good read. Having said this I beleave most do work and having tried some of them myself I know alot do work.
1,*Almost* straight into the bin.,"I almost tossed this one, then continued to read it as ""fiction""...making it worth a laugh. If you are interested in hunting/poaching I think you will be greatly disappointed, although there are a few morsels inside."
1,Good Tinder,"This book contains very little information that would actually be useful in a real survival situation. If you are interested in how to procure meat in the wild this book will dissapoint you.Instead, I reccomend studying tracking and primitive trapping. Those are skills which will pay off in the woods. It is full of tall tales. If you were in a survival tiuation there is one great value in this book. It is would make great tinder."
1,Fictional Stories,The writer has a typical poachers attitude with many stories that seem to be exagerated and doubtful. Some of the techniques he boasts about are impractical. The writer attempts to say that he knows how to manage wildlife better than biologists. He knows nothing about managing wildife over an entire state. It is obvious that he would not be able to manage wildife over a small section of land either because once his poaching depletes the area he moves on somewhere else. He cares nothing about the rights of people in general and only about himself. He is no more than any other typical poacher who brags about his poaching. He is obviously under the impression that poaching without getting caught make him the great hunter. He doesn't have a cluse and unfortunately never learned to appreciate nature and the outdoors.
1,sacrifices use-ability for spill-ability,"I anxiously awaited this product as my old reliable IBM was on it's last, last leg. After typing for several hours, I couldn't wait to return it. Wetkeys doesn't post their return policy, so I anxiously await it and will share my experience in an addendum. Here's the problem: The space key doesn't depress with the same pressure after each word. Sometimes it skips two or rarely more spaces,more frequently it doesn't register the space. The keys take more effort-to-depress than regular keyboards, so you end up with double letters too often, especially the aa. I've had to go back and deliberately maake a space between one in five words where the space bar did not register a depression. That's way too much. Finally, after fighting with this keyboard for several hourss, my fingers ache. I've never experienced aching fingers after typing before. I can't recommend this keyboard ass it stands. It's back to the drawing board with this one."
5,Authentic chinese out of the bottle,"Just add this to your lo mein or other chinese recipe for authentic restaurant taste. I use some soy, ground ginger, msg (yes I like the taste of it and my arms haven't dropped off yet) along with a little garlic and onion powder and of course some roasted sesame seed oil. The starter mixture is the basis for quite a few fine chinese dishes and the amounts of each can be adjusted to suit your taste. A few lo mein noodles, some shrimp or chicken or beef bits and you're quickly able to make a very tasty authentic lo mein. I don't use this in my fried rice, though but it is good in stir fried vegies, etc."
1,Yuck! Yuck! Yuck!,I really hate this product and now don't know how to get rid of it. I apologize for not being able to explain how sickening this product tastes but it's truly gross! Yuck! Yuck! Yuck!
4,Tastes Fine,"This product tastes fine. It's not the most gourmet Hoisen sauce out there, but it's still pretty good. My only complaint is that it was delivered a day later than Amazon told me it would be(supposed to be 2-day shipping), so it might not be the best thing to order in a pinch."
5,Great book,I hadn't read any Ellen G White books before. I tried to read a few but had trouble getting into them. This one was excellent though! I'm really glad I read it.
5,Amazing Book Focused On Truly Following Christ,"This book is Christianity 101. Every page is filled with Scripture and overflowing with the love and grace of Jesus Christ. If you have ever wondered what it truly means to be a Christian, or what Jesus actually taught (because how can we follow Christ if we don't know what He taught?) I would highly recommend this book!This book points the reader back to the Bible as our only true source for directions in this world."
2,"Great content, useless format","This is a book that's not well adapted to Kindle edition. The text is very interesting, but the pictures that, with no doubt, must be magnificent in color and printed form, become almost useless in b/w and the smallish size of the kindle version. Even a pdf or a mediocre color scanned copy of the printed book would be million years ahead. This is the last book reliant on pictures that I purchase in kindle format. I did'n find the option to have it returned (as I managed to do with another architectural book in kindle version I bought). I think Amazon must improve a lot the picture presentation and management for Kindle, or the format, a very practical one indeed, will become confined to literature, essays and text that don't depend on images for having a wholesome experience."
5,Greene and Greene,"If your interests include Greene and Greene, this is your book, house design, furniture design, and a good personal background on the Greene brothers"
1,"17,10 USD for a CD R???","I'm really dissapointed with this item! THE ALBUM IT'S REALLY GREAT! KILLER PIECE O METAL!, but this edition is really really bad, it comes in a bad quality press !! the worst I have seen !! for me this is not an original cd! it's a BAD copy!! NOT RECOMMENDED FOR REAL FOLLOWERS OF METAL MUSIC!"
1,"Sorry guys, thumbs down.","The determining factor for my interest in The Why Store is because of Michael Wanchic's involvement as producer. Wanchic is a long time band member for John Mellencamp. The band's preceeding release ""The Why Store"" with the song ""Lack of Water"" showed promise and gave optimism for the future. ""Two Beasts"" takes it all away. Way too much is centered around lead vocalist Chris Schaffer and he is unable to carry the load. ""No Matter"" is really the only ear popping track with ""Working"" being respectable because of an excellent bridge which pops about 40% into the track. ""Burnout"" and ""Two Beasts"" are so so at best. ""Do-Do-Do"", ""Who is Your Love"" and ""Maniac Man"" are below average songs and though I'm sure ""When You're High"" would excite some, it is nothing to me but a shallow pop song. A ""turn-off"" CD, my interest in this band is over."
3,expensive for personnal point de vue,"Very big, a lot of glossy pages, well printed, with several cuvées, from many, many producers. A must to reserve for those which did not have access to World Wild Webb. As various years produce various quality of grape, it's already out of date but a reference for those who look for the big print. Hope they will find another way to communicate their tasting note without paper."
3,"Meh, does the job.",Great for blown cotton insulation. I think for what it cost it should be framed out so it's not just sitting directly on the speaker.
5,nice,"they are nice and thick paper, very nice.they are nice and thick paper, very nice.they are nice and thick paper, very nice."
4,Are you scared yet?,"Well if you are, don't be. It's really not that kind of book. Although, there are some spots that might make your imagination get a little over excited given the right atmosphere. Never the less this book is built on a good foundation of story telling, and locations. Here's a little note: just in case you were looking for a book to tell you the exact directions to the haunts in it. You won't really find that here, but if you read a little bit into the locations given along with some of the facts around the stories. You can find most of the places on your own. Back to the review. There are a lot of good stories in this book. They were well written, and re-searched. If your looking for a fairly through guide to the supernatural happenings in Maine. This book would be a good place to start. I found it to be a great aid to me while I was searching for local legends. The book is an easy read, but a good one. I hope you enjoy it."
5,Hard-Core Cookery,"These gloves don't keep me feeling like anything less than a man, while I bake my skin-less chicken breasts. Very well designed and made, you could bake all day long. I've never used anything else.so the comparison is slim. Would I buy these again, if need be ? Heck yeah."
3,A little disappointed,"I remember loving this movie when I was a kid, but I just watched it with my four year old, and I was a little disappointed. It is not nearly to the caliber of Mary Poppins, to which it is often compared. The humor and setting are a lot darker, set as it is during World War II, and there is an under-current of anti-clericalism and of mass violence that is unsettling for a children's film.Others may find the animated sequence to be a high note. I thought it was long and tedious.What was better than remembered was the Portobello Road dance sequence, which I thought was truly ahead of its time. There is break-dancing, and even the beginnings of a moon walk dance move. It wouldn't surprise me if this is where Michael Jackson picked up the idea for his Billy Jean dance moves.I would definitely not recommend this for 4 year old girls. I think it skews a little older and is probably more appealing for boys than girls."
3,"Not as good as ""Mary Poppins""","The storyline in ""Bedknobs and Broomsticks""lagged a bit,and the songs aren't too memorable(the only song I ever remember from this movie is""Substitutiary Locomotion"").However,the animated sequences in ""Bedknobs""was done a lot better than the animated sequences in""Mary Poppins""(the soccer match was funny!).David Tomlison was funny in the animated sequences,but his performance was disappointing in the live-action scenes.(David was a LOT more convincing in ""Mary Poppins"")."
4,A dark Mary Poppins,"This is an edited Mary Poppins. The unmbrella becomes a bed. Victorian London becomes War-time England. The jolly holiday becomes a trip in animal land. Apart fom it being dark, this is a film of fancy. Recomended to MARY POPPINS lovers."
3,bednobs and broomsticks,"the old version was much better, I thought..The musical version of Bednobs and broomsticks seem less appeling. Besides, I just dont like musicals"
5,A classic,My 14 year old video game-loving son just found this in his room today. He said its been missing for a couple years. He's watching it now. That speaks for itself.
5,Bedknobs & Broomsticks,My kids loved the movie. I'm so glad you had it available for sale. I had been looking for it in stores for some time. The product was in excellent condition (new) and was shipped promptly. Thanks!
5,TRAGUNA MACOIDES AND A SMALL REVEIW FROM ME,"This movie is great I totally loved it. In my ranking of top three movies I gave Bedknobs and Broomsticks first by far ahead of Pinochio and Mary Poppins/Alice in Wonderland. The DVD format is great ,the extras are excellent and the movie is Super-Amazing-Brilliant-Great. The two books are also brilliant, likewise to the scenes Portobello Road, Substitutiary Locomotion,and Charlie as a rabbit! Rent or buy this DVD NOW NOW NOW! I bet you won't regret it."
3,Never thought I would say this about a Disney film.,"This film has a wonderful animation sequence directed by one of the premiere animation team of Disney Ward Kimble. The film also has great songs and quality but....I've never been prompted to do this before but I must for the discerning individual the new lip sync, if I can call it that is bad, David Tomlinson's impersonator and the lack of sync is truly irritating, frankly I'm shocked that the likes of Disney would let this film out in such uncompleted shape. That's it to those of you out there for whom this stuff is important when it comes to buy."
4,Classic childhood film,This was a film I watched over and over as a child. Every child should watch this one. Couldn't imagine my childhood without it. Love the ending.
5,Bedknoba and Broomsticks,"This one is a classic, if you love children's movies this is a favorite. I love the classic disney movies. I would recommen this and the other classics to any disney lover."
5,PURE MAGIC!,"Equally as excellent as MARY POPPINS, this fantastic part live, part animated film is made memroable by both performances and magnificent visual effects. Superb from beginning to end this is another in a huge line of Disney classics thats ageless in appeal."
1,Disappointed,"Maybe I am just a traditionalist...or, more likely, I enjoy singing along with the movie, but this original fully restored version is the pits. It was neat to see once but now I want the movie I have come to know and love. I hope Disney comes out with the original version released in 1971 on DVD. ..."
3,I'm concerned I didn't make this purchase,"I did not purchase this product, and I am wondering if my account has been compromised.I cannot find any other way to communicate this concern."
3,Blast from the Past,"This was a blast from the past. A little longer than I remember, and there was some awful dubbed voices throughout (sometime English, sometime Scottish, sometime Indian accent!) but it is well worth it. A particularly English theme Americanised by Walt Disney, fun for all the family."
5,Bedknobs and Broomsticks (30th Anniversary Edition),"Great communication! DVD was well packed and the movie was exactly as described. It was a pleasure doing business with Amazon, and I look forward for the opportunity to purchase more items in the very near future."
3,Just never got going,"I have two little kids now (8 mo's and 3 1/2yrs) and I'm scouring the reviews for good movies to get them that they can watch over and over. The average reviews for this movie rated it a 4 1/2 and the comments were pretty good.For me the movie was slow, more like a stage performance than a movie. The character development didn't seem to click well with all of the kids and the songs didn't bring you into the movie as well as some of the other Disney movies.We loved Pete's Dragon and my little girl would keep asking where is Elliot and singing the music. She didn't do that for this movie."
3,"Cute story, tad bit too long","I can see why the original theatrical release had songs and scenes cut to reduce the length. This is a cute story, but pacing is rather slow. Until they get to the mix of animation and live acting, it plods along. 'Portobello Road' is excruciatingly long.Still, it's good, clean family entertainment and a good film to own."
1,Did Not Work,"I was excited to see this item on Amazon because I have been looking for it, but the video came and didn't play right. I got about 5 minutes into the film and it died. Very disappointing."
1,SLOW,I bought this for my 3-year old since she just loves Chitty-Chitty Bang Bang and it just doesn't have any comparison. Amazon made the suggestion and I fell for it. Bad move! Very slow moving movie!!!
3,Oxy morons,The movie was very good at showing the downward spiral of how people begin using the drug recreationaly but it shows how u quickly change from having fun to having the drug consume ur whole life
2,Poor construction,"These chopsticks seemed ideal for my 3 year old, and they were great the first 2 times he used them. After only 2 uses, the rubber pieces in the clamp holding the chopsticks together broke and it never worked right again - one of the chopsticks would constantly fall out."
2,"Bulky, not secure","These might be more appropriate for an older child. For my toddler, they were bulky in the grip and not secure enough--they would roll past each other once he got a grip on some food, causing the morsel to go flying out of his grip."
5,Great Product,Product is great if you need one buy it here. So far so good. We will be ordering more soon.
4,Vintage Sherwood,8 tracks ranging from 2:10 to 15:28. Billy explores creates some great sounds and a variety of moods on this release. The title track ends with an anthem-like section that sounds very YES-like.
4,One of the best YES solo works in a long time.,"I've been keeping up with Billy ever since I found out that he was helping out in the Yes camp. This piece of work shows how far Billy has come in his career, and also gives a good indictation of where will be heading in the furture. Not the best ""Yes solo"" release, but I would put in a top 10 list."
3,Nancy Wilson is a greatest hit,The editing on this CD is poor. Several of the tracks are difficult to find. It is a good CD to keep in your car collection.
3,Good - if you can handle one very off pitch song,"I love all of my albums of Tish Hinojosa - including this one - BUT I must say, I have to skip over ""She's a Highway"" because of how extremely flat she is on it. I guess it's one of the perils of recording a live album. I'm surprised no one else has mentioned it .... that one song is hard to listen to."
1,Defective Product,"We ordered this for my 13-year-old daughter. Of course she was very excited because it was pink and appeared to be a good deal since the only other review on Amazon was positive. Unfortunately three of the six tuner heads simply didn't function - they can not be tightened. When we took it to the music store to see how much it would cost to repair it the cost was about what we spent on the guitar. Unfortunately with Austin Bazaar even if they ship you a defective product you must pay the return shipping charges so as you can see we'll have to give this guitar and Austin Bazaar a one-star review. I could see having to pay the return shipping charges if we simply didn't like the color, but I can't believe I'm required to pay because they shipped us a non-functional product."
2,Umm..,"This is my first guitar, so I wasn't expecting much. I recieved the guitar, the case, one pick, and the stand (not all that the picture shows). I expected everything the picture shows, so i emailed the company and they agreed to send me everything else. They sent a strap. I gave up after that because it was too much hassle, but that was a dissapointment. The guitar itself had funny spots of messed up (smudged?) paint on it. There was a few dings on it, but over looking that, it plays well and wasn't too expensive. (Well, they sell the same guitar for like $30 dollars without the stuff in the picture. So pretty much it comes with what i got. So I reccommend getting that one.)"
3,Son's favorite toy,"My son received a ""Blossom the Bear"" when he was born and has been attached to it ever since. If he lost the bear he would probably go into some sort of shock and have problems with fear of desertion when he grows up. Nobody wants any of that, so I purchased the bear as a stuffed animal insurance policy. Of course, my son thinks that it is a lion, not a bear because the ""blossom"" going around the bear's head looks like a makeshift lion's mane. He has aptly named the bear ""Baby Lion."" His new one, which my wife made me give him prematurely, has been named ""Baby Air Force"" for some reason. I wasn't even in the Air Force, I was in the Navy, so I'm not sure why he did that but I think the fact that he is thinking for himself and making such important decisions is a plus.Again, just an insurance policy. He takes ""Baby Lion"" and ""Baby Air Force"" everywhere with him. They are great companions for whatever adventures a 4 year old goes on."
2,Unedited manuscript,"I must admit that I have not yet finished this novel. I bought it having loved a previous novel by this author. Unfortunately,I found reading this novel unbearable due to the complete lack of editing done on thhe writing. Such a poor quality of product should really not be sent for publishing! I hereby volunteer to edit the next book before it is released on Kindle, but I will not pay to read it in this form."
2,Too Little for Too Much,I agree with the first three reviewers... All I needed was the replacement disc cleaner wheel... It was truly aggravating; especially since they had been marketed separately just a short time ago... I'm going to have to rethink this -- new disc cleaner or keep getting too little product at too much cost...
4,Must have if you have kids or teens in your house. This is the next best thing to a professional machine,Must have if you have kids or teens in your house. This is the next best thing to a professional machine
2,Wheel didn't fit,"Got this for my existing CD cleaning machine that has a worn out wheel. This wheel did not fit the machine, it would not stay on during operation. Useless purchase for me."
4,Prefer spray but still good,"I love this. It fixes all my messed up CDs, DVDs, games and more. It's a miracle worker! Prefer spray liquid because it lasts longer and goes on better."
5,accessory kit for Skip Dr.,"When I was at my grandsom's house, I saw many disc's that were not clean. I purchased a Skip Dr cleaning kit plus this accessory kit so that they could clean all their discs. These items work very well. I have the Skip Dr myyself for my son."
3,what happend???,The price on this kit doubled from the last time I purchased. I can by a brand new motorized unit for the same price. That is ridiculous.
2,Just one more homecoming . . .,"By now, you'd think that authors-especially ones as popular as these two-would know enough to leave this story line alone. Baby is conceived under inconvenient circumstances. Baby is adopted by two stock character parents-one who dotes on her and one who stifles her. Baby grows up ""unaware of her hidden past."" Eventually, somehow, the truth comes out, and Baby-Turned-Young-Woman leaves to find her ""real"" family. And the beat goes on . . . other stock characters featured here include the bitter war hero (Harry Grimes), the uncomplaining Christian ""martyr"" (Joel), and the loyal, God-fearing servant (literal servant in this case: Maggie). It's ironic that the title fits so perfectly! The abundant cliches kept me at arm's length throughout the entire novel, never allowing me to become intrigued with or attached to anyone. This one simply lacks the original twists needed to stand out of the teeming ""adopted kid story"" crowd."
3,"Exhaustive and, at times, exhausting","I bought this book at the Christian Science reading room in Boston next to the Mother Church at the recommendation of one of the staff members. She said the book was a good fit for someone who wasn't a Christian Scientist, but wanted to learn more about Mrs. Eddy. I found Gillian Gill's carefully documented biography to be thorough in most respects. Some of the financial issues were glossed over -- How did Ms. Eddy really become so wealthy? While she certainly isn't fawning, Ms. Gill seems too gentle in her treatment of Mrs. Eddy's paranoia about ""malicious animal magnetism."" The second half of the book is markedly more readable than the first."
3,"A sympathetic, feminist biography","As a Christian Scientist, it was refreshing to see a non-Christian Scientist's admiring response to the life of Ms Eddy. Ms Gill's feminist viewpoint is an appropriate one and her sensitivity to the issues of being a woman at Ms Eddy's time were helpful. On the whole, I think Ms Gill did an excellent job of articulating Ms Eddy's successes and failures--although her bluntness may be a problem for those who have idealized Ms Eddy.My major problem with this book is that it discounts the spiritual aspects of Ms Eddy's life and attempts to tell her story as if she were a secular success. In failing to recognize--or credit--the power of the Divine in Ms Eddy's life Ms Gill has deprived herself and the reader of the simplest explanation for Ms Eddy's great achievements.All in all, an interesting, useful book, but not one who's viewpoint I can share."
3,"Cute, but not especially deep","Ekin Cheng stars as jobless designer. When a job for an image consultant appears in the recruitment center he applies, even though he has no experience. His job? To make a hapless and clueless young heiress, into a lady.I enjoyed this film, despite the fact that its not especially deep. Cheng was handsome and gracious, the other actors funny and amusing. My problem? I just found it difficult to believe that someone as handsome and well-dressed as Cheng would be so clueless about women's fashion. Dior Cheng not able to dress? Please.Still, this is a light amusing comedy if that's what you're looking for...Its just not a masterpiece by any means."
5,Very nice,"These are well made, and a perfect size for my 11 yr old granddaughter.Small, but carry a big sparkle!"
4,The Human Being,"Richard Thompson is a noble human being. Finding early recognition for his pioneering guitarism and songwriting ability in everyone's favorite english folk rock band, he then chose the more difficult path of starting anew. Rising from the anonymity of this first solo effort, the path of his career has been one of constant development, revision, evolution. So, in view of his now well established career, this recording may be seen in hindsight as the record that jump-started all that he has become today. The pieces are in place: historic sounding folk composition, legendary electric guitar and vocal style, idiosyncratic arrangement and production. Thompson himself has been dismissive of this album, but it should not be overlooked by the man's admirers. For anyone who has followed Thompson's post Fairport career, this is where it all began."
5,FOLKS GET THIS MUSIC,"One of Richard's best albums, every track is great, especially with the awesome SHM. Must have for any CD collection, but don't pay these ridiculous over-inflated rip off prices. I purchased mine from The Music Specialist on E Bay, save yourself a ton of cash!"
4,RT's great 2nd act,"I'm writing this review partially from memory. This was a favorite early 70's album, but in recent years I've only heard about half the tracks. This was RT's first statement after leaving Fairport Convention, where he pioneered revolutionary fusion of traditional ballads and rock. This album was an admirable step forward, reaching heigths that he only occasionally touched during the Richard & Linda years and only truly exceeded with Rumor and Sigh almost 2 decades later. There are some throwaways here, but the best songs are rich with humor, invention, and emotion. I haven't heard ""The Old Changing Way"" in 15 years, but it still moves me to tears. If any CD ever tempts me to spend $25 for an import, it would be this one."
2,Not very logically structured,"This book presents something like 50 sentence patterns. This makes things overly complex since (naturally) many of them will be related and just minor variation. To complicate things further, the author also introduces what she calls variations to the basic sentence patterns. This endless variation without a clear structure is annoying. However, you can naturally copy down all the structures and create a diagram of how they are all related by yourself. Paradoxically this will probably improve your learning, but shouldn't the book really do this?Calling it a dictionary is slightly dishonest. It is a learner's dictionary of very simple sentence patterns. Just so you know what you're getting"
3,Good as a side book,"This was my first book to learn about the Japanese language, and I find this pretty good once I understand it's pattern. I had to re-read several times. And this is really just about learning sentence structures, not on learning vocabulary.What I like about it is that it also includes the Japanese language and not just the English Romanji."
3,"""Basic"" is the right word","I was a little disappointed when my copy of ""Basic Japanese Sentence Patterns"" arrived in the mail. I am a 2nd year student of Japanese and thought the book could help me develope my Japanese proficiency by disecting Japanese sentences. Unfortunately, I found the bood to be a little too basic. The author concentrates on very simple sentence patterns (noun+verb or noun+adverb+verb etc.) This is fine for beginners, but for someone like myself who has more or less mastered these basic patterns and was hoping to use the book to learn how to construct more complex, longer sentences, it isn't much help. The verb congegations in the back are useful though."
4,Emotional and Brilliant,"I had lost track of Marillion soon after their early rise. I stumbled across this album recently when it was released on Yahoo's music service. I was quite suprised that the music was drawing me in, so much that I needed to listen to it again. Here was some stirringly emotional stuff! This is not an album that you can listen to just anytime. It is mostly solemn and dark but it has a drive to it that is uplifting simply because it is so powerful. It's hard to find this style of music that doesn't sound overbearing and cheesy. Marillion manages to push very close to the edge with the dramatics but never goes overboard. It's really nice to find good music that you somehow missed the first time around. I'll have to go through some more of Marillion's library."
5,Hands down the best album of the 90's,"Unbelievable, emotionally exhausting masterpiece. That this is not on the top of every critcs poll for best albums of the last 25 years is beyond me. Runs the gamut from tender to sparkling to agonizing..I can't even begin to describe what this album does to me."
3,Merely meek,"If ever a band embodied the flimsy ambitions of the slickly produced neo-prog set, albeit with a certain amount of legitimately relative solidarity, it is Marillion"
2,What a mess!,Marillion squanders it's considerable musical talent by allowing Steve Hogarth to continue as vocalist and songwriter. What was once an outstanding prog outfit has degenerated into a pseudo-eighties hair-metal pop band. This is a terrible waste of ability. Hogarth's over-emoting vocal style is as subtle as the German's invasion of Poland. Skip this one and turn to The Flower Kings or Transatlantic for quality contemporary prog...Simon
5,Broadway voice meets TALENTED musicians,"I saw my first Marillion show right after Afraid of Sunlight came out at Club Bene here in NJ. I had heard Season's End a few times before, but I went to the show with my brother who was a fan, and had seen them open for Rush years earlier. THE NEXT DAY I made it my primary goal to get the Afraid of Sunlight CD. Steve Hogarth has a powerful voice which gives the album a rich LIVE SHOW almost Broadway feeling. The best part of any Marillion album is how the entire album as a single piece of work effects the listener. I can highlight Cannibal Surf Babe and Gazpacho as songs that I love as singles, but really this is an album to enjoy on a good stereo with full concentration on the music, words, and feelings that Afraid of Sunlight generates. I would also tell a reader to go and get the album Brave also... Everything that Marillion has ever done is amazing and worth a listen.... Tell your Friends."
2,Anti-Climactic,"I've purchased dozens of SpongeBob items for my daughter, and this was the first that disappointed. It is a very small book, and not quite worth the price.All other items/books, though, have been great."
3,flipbook mania,"I purchased this book as an example for a flip book art activity with my students. Because Sponge Bob is so popular, the book was a hit although I did find better FB examples."
5,On Hesse's Knulp,"This is one of Hesse's early works and as such is full of the great landscape imagery that would become more rare in his later works. It has, however, the kernels for the ideas developed further in Siddartha. It is a very enjoyable read that starts to hint at the philosophical themes that would become central to Hesse later in life. A must-read for anyone who enjoys Hesse."
4,Just What I Expected!,"I am a huge fan of the Brand New Heavies' fusion of R&B, funk, and soul. Being such a big fan, I was saddened when N'dea Davenport left the band to pursue her solo career. However, N'dea's debut self-titled album is filled with the music that made her and the Brand New Heavies famous and loved by many.I would highly recommend this CD to fans of the BNH as well as people who have not listened to the band. This is a style of music that makes you feel good, and in these times of sadness and war in the world today, we need more albums like this!"
2,I really was disappointed by this album,"I bought this album because it was one of my Amazon recommendations, which are usually pretty much on point. Unfortunately, I felt it left much to be desired, and at times the whole soulsistah, ""riotgrrrl"" thing seemed forced. I think her voice is great, but this material does not do her justice.Perhaps, as one of the reviewers below suggests, one cannot expect N'Dea to continue along in the BNH vein. I enjoy the BNH, particularly her contribution to the group, and I thought this was just not a great solo debut."
4,Pleasantly Surprised!,"When a talented lead singer leaves one of your favorite groups, it leads to a very difficult decision when they launch their solo projects. Will it be the quality that you are used to or will it be a bust????? N'dea has definitely made this a valuable purchase to add to my collection. The musical variety displayed on this CD allows her to gradually move away from the ""acid jazz"" sound that we are used to hearing and give her an opportunity to blaze her own trail. My favorite songs are the seductive ""When the night falls"" and ""Underneath a Red Moon."" This CD is a break from all of those artists with big budgets and little talent. I look forward to her next solo project."
4,Excellent and unique. A true stand out.,"N'Dea Davenport has come on very strong and left the Brand Heavies behind her. My favorite song on the CD is track 2 ""Underneath the Red Moon"" followed by Whatever you want"", Old Man and B*** S*** in. I recommend this CD for any one that is tried of the sample to death sound of these current teenage female artist who are controling the air waves. This CD is a must buy."
4,A wonderful solo debut by a distinctive R&B voice,"On her first solo effort after leaving the acclaimed Acid Jazz operation, Brand New Heavies, N'dea Davenport steps out with a diverse blend of old and new R&B. Her rich and soulful vocals enliven even the blandest of material, and she's at her best singing softly on ""Real Life"", wailing over the dance track ""Never Again"", and breathing real life into the Neil Young track ""Old Man."" Let's hope this talented artist finds an audience so that she can continue to produce classic R&B records."
4,quickie,"I enjoy the music on this CD. It is funny and has a great funk beat. Mr George Clinton made his mark by building on the Funk of Mr James Brown. Many of the JB team became members of Parliment. Here, Mr Clinton updates those rhythms of the seventies by adapting them to the sound of the eighties. He has lots of great help from his friends, including Bootsie Collins, and a singer-songwriter who used to have a name. ;D Not only is the Funk the best, the songs are entertaining, tongue-in-cheek social statements. ""Quickie"" exposes the little known secret that ladies sometimes make a Bootie Call. ""Last Dance"" is a good-natured parody of ""Let's Dance"" by Mr David Bowie, and the title track is an anti-nuke commentary. If you enjoy humour in your music coupled with Super Super Heavy Funk, this CD will be interesting to you."
3,one of George's most underatted disc,"This disc is the bomb!The good Dr again redefines funk on this overlooked effort.The two best cuts are ""Last Dance""(which has a good natured rip on ""Let's Dance by David Bowie"")that includes a great lryic""Well are you some kind of psychedelic wallflower?""And the title track which has some amasing keyboard work as well as more of George's unique wordplay""With electronic bait,Man is nuclear fission,and the fish on his line is bigger than his mind than the reality of the real he has to reel it in....you should'tve bit fish! ""Here is tha Clinton who should be in the white house!One nation under a groove,Yall"
1,Save your money,These bags were too small. I fit 1 comforter and 1 blanket. It was hard to get the air out. And if that weren't enough it didn't keep the air out.
3,The Creative Downslide Continues,"Like the previous ALL OF THIS LOVE, EVERY TIME finds Pam Tillis again relying on middling material that fails to live up to her obvious talent. While the songs throughout range from great ('I Said A Prayer','A Great Disguise') to awful(the sappy title track, 'A Whisper And A Scream'), some of the blame can probably be put on her choice of producer( Billy Joe Walker, who also managed to dull Mindy McCready's edge on her DOA third effort). At some point, Tillis needs to wise up and ditch her producer, the person who helps her pick her songs(she's highly capable of writing first-rate material all by herself), and anyone else willing to let her settle for second and third-rate cast-offs like this."
3,Product,They work as expected. I was disappointed in the discription of item stating Leatherette Back. I have never seen leather look and feel like paper and this is what I received.
3,gets the job done,"if you're on a budget, these will do well enough. they can be inconsistent in the alignment of their covers to their fasteners but if you want better quality, you'll have to pay for it."
2,Illustrations are too scary,"I bought this classic story for my son, based on the previous two reviews. Unfortunately, I will not be giving this book to him. Many of the illustrations are far too scary for a preschool child. I only wish the publisher had provided the opportunity to see inside this book before buying it on blind faith. Let's see...the giant himself has lots of large ugly teeth, a hairy mole-riddled misshapen head, and a permanent scowl on his face (His wife is just as mean and ornery looking.); there are skulls and bones, presumably the leftovers from past ""meals,"" all over his castle (Try explaining what those are to a curious young preschooler!); while nasty looking vultures, rats, bats, and snakes abound. The artwork is indeed very detailed and colorful. However, in my opinion it is not appropriate for the younger age range (age 4) specified in the reading level."
3,Okay,"This is great to show off your favorite team, but it doesn't hold up to having multiple items on the reel. If you have more than just a ID, the reel gets stuck."
1,I didn't get what I ordered.,I ordered two Patriot retractable badge holders and received two Patriot keychains. I haven't contacted the company yet due to time restrictions. Not sure how to proceed.
5,Excellent Ballance,"I've known Warren for quite a few years, and I have always found his work to be well written and worthwhile. For masculinist, Warren is very even handed and fair in his treatment of a subject that invited polemics. He's a great guy, and I look forward to more of his work. This is highly recommended for the Non-Custodial and the Custodial parent."
5,One of the Best Books on Father Child Relationships,"I recently met Dr. Warren Farrell, who was speaking on our behalf, Men and Women Against Discrimination of West Virginia, as we were trying to pass a Shared Parenting Bill into the WV House. www.mawadwv.orgDr. Farrell has disarmed this sensitive topic and shown plainly how important shared parenting is for any child and the benefits of a father in a child life, at any age or time. If you you are single, married or divorced, this book will show you how important a father is to a child's development is almost every aspect of life.You will not be dissappointed."
5,"must read for all dads, all men, all women","For men and women, everyone interested in current gender predicaments and how to ease the tension this is must reading. The most articulate analysis of how we got into such a mess (no blaming) and how to love each other again, and the disaster zone that radical feminism has made of childhood. Clear, intelligent, human, compassionate, good- natured - therefore, probably doomed to fail in this sad, mixed-up country."
2,This is research? This is writing?,"I am unable to evaluate Dr. Warren's thesis, conclusions, etc., because of a primary impediment: he is a terrible writer, and an even worse researcher. He resorts to hyperbole, faulty logic, and anecdotes to support his arguments. Perhaps his methodology might be less noticeable if he were a skillful writer and/or an impressive intellect. Unfortunately, he is neither."
1,Wonder if Farrell still thinks incest is positive,"I dunno, I'm kind of skeptical about taking fatherly advice from a guy who thinks that incest is just a sign of a repressed society, and who's gone on record saying that date rape used to be just a good time. Hm, a good time for whom, one wonders?Farrell likes to leave out certain facts. Like, for example, his complaints about how men die sooner and work more dangerous jobs. The former is proof of what, exactly? The latter is disingenuous---men work more dangerous jobs from wihch women are excluded because these jobs tend to pay better. Then the danger is used as an excuse to keep women out of those jobs because the little ladies need protection, for which men of the Farrell type expect gratitude. Farrell mentions at some point that almost no women died in the Viet Nam war. This is becuase women weren't allowed to FIGHT in the Viet Nam war at all. And so forth and so on."
3,Breaking Bad Costume,"Ordered this for my Breaking Bad Cooking Costume.Came in gray, not in pink. :(And the extra filters were also gray!"
3,3M 6291 Respirator,"I am 6'3"" 220 lbs, have an average size head but have a broad nose bridge. I bought this respirator in a medium size and found that it was too small and uncomfortable after wearing it for an hour or more. I ended up buying the 3M 7500 respirator in large and it fits great and is made of a more comfortable material. The 7500 also forces exhaust downwards and away from your glasses or faceshield to prevent fogging.Get the 7500 and go large if you have any doubts of the size."
5,Works Great!,I have bad allergies in the spring and summer time and I currently am taking care of foreclosed homes yard work here in the mountains. Without this respirator there is no way I could get as many homes done in a day and as comfortably as I do. My allergies would be killing me!
2,No Filters?,With severe allergies I was recommended one of these masks and believed that they came with the filters as pictured and as several reviewers have mentioned. When I received the item (later than was the projected delivery date) no filters were in the package. Only the plastic mask piece itself. I was rather disappointed.
5,Great compact design,This is more comfortable than the larger respirator found in big box stores. Small and compact design and doesnenter in the way of my safety glasses. fits snug for long stretches with out being uncomfortable while working in my shop.
3,"Works fine, just doesn't fit quite right.","I would not consider myself to have large facial features, but i think the large size would fit me better than a medium. After wearing this for a couple of hours the bridge of my nose is very sore, it still hurts the next day. Maybe I have it too tight, but I couldn't get a good seal without tightening it. Oterwise it works great, I like the lightweight filters as compared to my other dust mask (MSA i think)MSA Safety Works 817663 Multi-Purpose Respiratorwith the large plastic filters that hang out a ways. But even with the heavier filters on my other mask, it isn't uncomfortable to wear all day. I would suggest getting a large if you have any doubt as to the fit."
5,"works great, wife loved cute pink filters","my wife got this respirator to use while she was taking down some popcorn ceiling in our house. she thought the pink filters were 'cute'. i liked that they are rated for asbestos. probably not any in the popcorn, but better safe than sorry."
4,looked a bit girly but worked well,don't quite dig the pinkish obnoxious looking filter but it worked well to keep me from breathing the rust that I was sanding. I wish it came in some sort of containers to keep it clean. I used a bit ziplock bag to store it. No big deal
4,mask,Was the best price I could find. Arrived on time and was as expected from product description. Overall pleased with product.
1,incomplete,"I got the mask with no filters and the only option they give you is to return the mask instead of simply sending the filters, bad service, bad solutions, I would not order from this store again."
4,4 Walls is tha Bomb,"I don't know if you like the type of music I like, but the 4 Walls track and the Lay Yo Body Down track are so tight. I love these songs, every time I hear them, I just want to lay my body down."
3,"Album Version 5 Stars, Remix Versions 2 Stars","Well you have probably heard the album version, a great single; and if you have purchased untouchables, you have heard the T-Rays Remix, which is Ok. The last remix on the CD is a nine minute and 40 some second dance track with very few of the here to stay lyrics within the song. I love Korn as much as ANYONE but this one falls a little short. Buy Untouchables first, a great CD, and the thoughtless single before you get this one."
3,Somewhat inconsistent,"Considering that tests at different points on the same string frequently give different readings, multiple tests should be taken, and their average values should be used."
3,"Pass on this one, buy the Rabbit instead","I was extremely excited when I originally ordered this item, as I have had great luck with this type of opener in the past. In addition, the extras in the package make this an attractive item. However, even though the gears of the the corkscrew are made of metal, the handles and body seem to be made of a cheap, flexible plastic. The solid feel of the Rabbit is missing in this model. In addition, about one of every 5 corks is not removed properly. The bottle stopper and drip ring are nice, but the foil remover is the worst I have ever used. Do yourself a favor and spend a little more money on a better quality opener..."
4,A New Way to Remove Corks,"I've wanted this sort of opener but would not pay the [$$] or more it would cost to get one, until this amazing offer appeared. My first couple of attempts to open were clumsy, but once I got the hang of it ""normal"" corks open without a hitch. I find that I still use the old style opener on faux corks that seem to be stressing the mechanism of this opener."
4,Great product that lasts,"I purchased this from Amazon back in 2003, and it has held up very well under regular use. The only part I have an issue with is the foil cutter - it was never very sharp to begin with, and now it is so dull that it's almost useless. Other than that, everything is still working extremely well - definitely worth the money!!"
4,"Good Looks, Great Function.","After reading some of the other comments about the Houdini kit I must have received the best of the best because I have opened at least 50 bottles of wine with mine and it still works like the day it arrived. I am still on the first cork screw (they are replaceable) and it works like a champ.Some of the other items that accompany the corkscrew are less than ideal but for function, this is the way to go & at a very decent price on the Friday Sales."
3,mind is matter-prana-chi-kundalini,"Those who have studied eastern energy modalities such as Reiki, Prana or Kundalini will enjoy this early century interpretation of the energy body. Old Fashioned language is used but those who have studied the modern energy understandings will be intrigued by explanations that we now know even quantum physicists support about the mind and body connection."
5,An excellent resource book!,I have read all of the books in the series by A.E. Powell and the knowledge is enlightening.
5,Outstanding Resource,"Well written and comprehensive resource for dealing with all patients, especially the challenging ones. I found it practical and concise, and I find myself constantly referring to it. I also found it easy to read and, despite the subject, somewhat fun to read as well."
5,Nothing But The Best Here!,"All-Time Favorites delivers!!! There are 10 songs on the CD and you're probably gonna miss some quality time with your family listening to 'em. I'm listening to it right now!I'm a young guy but Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy just does something to me. I love songs with lots of vocal harmony. This CD has Harmony at it's best, folks! No kiddin'! I really liked ""RUM And Coca Cola""; I'd never heard it before and, now, I won't be able to get it off my mind. It's sooooo cool!As you might know, swing is in right now - it's the happening thing. Some of these songs really will make you bounce - especially ""HOLD TIGHT."" You'll LOVE IT!"
4,Great value for the price,I like to order extra books because the books these kids have to carry back and forth to school are very heavy. I ordered this bood as an extra to keep at home. The book is in great condition and I didn't pay for a new book. I bought used and it worked for me.
4,Wierd Curriculum,"I like this book even though this book is not as interesting and it is like a ""dirt-sandwitch"" now. I am a self-study student that attends school in Taipei and my school uses the newer one. This one is boring."
3,Architect's text enjoyable to read,"This basically documents the architect's work but is not a great book. The photos, although good, are not top quality. There are lots of construction drawings, in a separate section (forcing a lot of flipping back and forth, BTW), but they were not redone for the book, are tiny reproductions of the originals, so not too readable. You usually at least get a floor plan, and some rough sketches in the text section, but the point of the book is not to explain how these buildings are built.The worst aspect is the commentary by the two authors, mere filler material. The best are the words of the architect himself, who can offer background on all his projects, and who comes across as very sincere."
5,Great Architect,"Glenn Murchutt's works do ""touch this earth lightly."" They are beautifully done yet so simple. The book is well worth this otherwise outrageous price."
1,NO WARRANTY @ Amazon.com,"My Radar detector was purchased January 2010. One month later the detector stopped working and would not turn on. I verified it was not the power source or the cable; the unit was receiving power but would not turn on. Well I wasn't too happy but I knew it was covered by a 1 Year warranty. I called up Beltronics only to find out that they DO NOT HONOR WARRANTY CLAIMS for products purchased from Amazon.com!!! Even worse, they wanted $79.99 + shipping to fix the unit. Needless-to-say, I find their level of customer service inadequate and disconcerting given the volume of product they sell through this site. I will not purchase another Beltronics product and would advise highly against it given their lack of professionalism in standing behind the quality of their own product."
4,My thoughts,"I first heard this on the radio in the late 70's, and really liked the title song. I only recently found it at the store and bought it in the used section. It seemed to me that Derringer and producer Todd Rundgren were trying to cover all the popular styles of the time, so it is rather dated, but the title track is still cool in my book!"
5,The Gun To Remember,"1957 a very good year, the year my family moved to California and the first year of Have Gun Will Travel entered the living room. The year the little tone "" Have Gun Will Travel Is The Name Of the Man (Paladin) entered my life. Richard Boone with his curly looking hair, big mustache,and black hat made the TV show come to life. Who said the good guy always wears a white hat? If you were one of the badmen in Paladins days you had better be on guard and have that hand on your gun, Paladin would be looking for you. This complete first season of 39 episodes will keep your hand at your side, ready to draw when Paladin makes his move. In 1963 I left high school and Have Gun Will Travel left the TV screen. Do you remember the words ""Hey Boy"" the coolie manservant that always gave Paladin the newspaper? you know the newspaper where Paladin found his next badman to gun down. A DVD thats a must for your TV shows of the past collection. Larry Hobson- Author- The Day Of The Rose"
5,Pure Western Gold and the Theme Song is Coming!,"Folks should check their facts before giving thumbs down to something. The great theme song didn't come until later in the series. Be patient, buy 'em all, and you'll soon get that great song. I for one am glad Paramount did this right and DIDN'T put the song on the first season, giving the show to viewers exactly the way it was. Paramount deserves applause! And Richard Boone was one of the greatest actors to ever grace the small tube. Hopefully, someone will dust off ""The Richard Boone Show"" at some point."
5,Great Entertainment,"The series is even better than I recalled especially the stories by Gene Rodenberry and Ida Lupino. It's wonderful seeing all your favorite actors in their youth, just starting out.Stories with a social compassion not politically popular today with our blind spots and jingoism."
5,Great western,"Great western, can't wait to get the other seasons, too bad seasons 4-7 won't be made. This review justs adds to the chorus who think this is one of the best shows."
5,"Have DVD, will watch","Simply great television from the fifties. Richard Boone was never better than as Palidan. You get some really superb writing from many of the best. Gene Roddenberry wrote around 20 episodes of HGWT. Didn't he start some other franchise series, say Star Trek? Into this mix add some really great guest stars like Charles Bronson. This is not just a shoot-em-up western. Many issues of that day and this one are explored in the episodes. Topics of racism or women rights get some really toughtful treatments. Look for some good action, too. Hard to believe you can get that in a 30 minute show but the writing is just that good. If you have seen this before you know what is in store. If this is new raise your expectations and watch this."
4,Deja View,"Great Minds think alike, Dave Lessenberry and me. As a little kid watching this program, I ALSO thought Paladin's first name was ""Wire"". I just assumed people had strange names back inna day. I guess if they made this show today, we'd have a generation of kids assuming his name to be ""Fax"" or ""e-mail""."
4,have fun-with gun,"Enjoyable black and western tv series.Richard Boone is a cultured, heroic gun for hire."
2,What Happened to the Theme Song...?,"Although I am a big fan of Have Gun Will Travel, I have to give this DVD collection a thumb's down. An integral part of the series was the closing theme song. (remember the boys singing this while walking along the railroad tracks in Stand By Me?)The loss of the Ballad of Paladin from the DVD renders it incomplete for any true fan of this classic series. If someone knows the story behind this, please let me know."
5,I am not the best...,"...man to write a review about Have Gun Will Travel and that's because this show is so fully charged of nostalgia and childhood memories that I would have bought it even if it had come in Betamax format.What I can certainly say is that video quality is excellent, box/package is pretty and convenient, current price is a bargain and there is a very nice quantity and quality amount of show information regarding cast and screenplay. Last but certainly not least (specially in my case) the DVD's have the convenience of Spanish subtitles."
5,a True Western Show,"As this was my favorite TV show when I was growing up, I was absolutely thrilled to be able to get the entire first season on DVD ( I home the rest of the show comes out on DVD also). If you are a western fan, this show is for you. It is intelligent and fast paced and, in comparison to today's TV shows, not really violent. The shows were thought provoking and very well done. I highly recommend this show to any and all lovers of great TV."
5,Brought back old memories,"I bought this for my dad as a Christmas present. I watched a few of the episodes and liked them well enough to want to see more.My dad, however, had seen this show when it was originally broadcast on TV, and talked about it occasionally, so when I found this on DVD, I bought it for him. He loved it! He watched it every day until he'd finished all the episodes. It brought back all kinds of memories. I bought him season two the next Christmas. He loved that one just as much."
5,Great CD set,I bought this for my son and he loves it. He tries to watch one or two episodes every night.
4,Been wanting it,"Was a gift, person wanted it and was happy to receive it since he has been looking for it awhile. Possibly be buying the next few seasons"
4,"Have Gun, Will Travel, First Season","My father watched this series religiously when I was a kid, so I decided to see what there was. I am in the middle of the first year, but it has proved to be a most interesting series. While many aspects may seem ""politically incorrect"" today, the episodes are interesting with politically correct lessons to be learned. Plus, he was a gunslinger who started out at West Point. While his gun may have been ""for hire"" there is usually a telling moral to each tale."
3,BE WARNED !!,"This collection (the package calls it ""The Franchise Collection""; Amazon lists it as ""The Gary Cooper Collection"") includes the only DVD on which I've been able to find ""Beau Geste"", my all-time favorite Gary Cooper filmSo far, I've only viewed ""Beau Geste"", --- video and audio were fine.I rate the DVD's video and audio qualities (for ""Beau Geste"") a 5, but the wretched package barely earned a 0. It's attractive, but it's miserably designed. I was able to free he disk containing ""Beau Geste"" only by very, very carefully breaking the ""push"" button; fortunately I didn't harm the disk in removing it, but I didn't enjoy the struggle.If you buy this collection, be sure you have one or two decent storage containers for the two disks. Memorex makes excellent one-disk and two-disk DVD storage cases, sold in packs of 5 and 10 cases per pack.William Beesonsyaloch"
1,BUYERS BEWARE!,"Be forewarned: this otherwise excellent set of disks is marred by an INCOMPLETE PRINT of ""The General Died at Dawn"", which makes nonsense of the meeting between the Cooper & Carrol characters. Their whole first scene, where they first meet, is MISSING. The print cuts from her argument with her father re ensnaring Cooper to join her on the train, to her boarding the train the following day and being confronted by Cooper in her cabin, who embraces her passionately and declares he is nuts about her. I suggest prospective buyers lay seige to Universal,demanding they re-issue the set. Or boycott the collection. HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?"
1,Universal....stop giving us cheapjack DVDs & treat 'em right,"The 1 star rating doesn't apply to the movies. DESIGN FOR LIVING is fun, BEAU GESTE is rousing, LIVES OF A BENGAL LANCER, PETER IBETSON and THE GENERAL DIED AT DAWN are corny...only for the diehard collector.What's disappointing is how Universal slapped these films together with no care whatsoever!The transfers range from adequate to lousy, and the films are packaged and manufactured in a way that easily lends itself toscratching and ultimate defective, worthless product.Universal needs to take some lessons from Fox, Paramount or Warner in terms of how to release their DVDs. For shame!"
4,the lives of a bengal lamcer,"gary cooper at his best, however to our standards now the action is a bit slow,but i am glad to see this picture again."
1,Disappointing,"So far I have seen 2 of the movies in this set: Design for Living and Peter Ibbetson and was disappointed in both. As a fan of High Noon, I was appalled by the shabby morality in these movies. This is not sexual sophistication but loose morals and no sense of real love for others. Real men and women love and stick with their spouses. My advice is to buy something else."
1,Bad mechandise from SouceMedia Storefront,"I bought from NorAm International Partners, also known as SourceMedia Storefront,The Gary Cooper Collection (Design for Living / The Lives of a Bengal Lancer / Peter Ibbetson / The General Died at Dawn / Beau Geste)It was made up of 2 disks and 5 movies. Only one movie would play out of five. I tried the discs on 3 DVD players with the same results."
4,no bonus features,"The quality of these ""prints"" makes them look crisp and new, however, no bonus features whatsoever."
4,I Want to Ta Ta You Baby,"When Etta James was created, the mold was broken and there will never be another.We have lost yet another vocal legend.I was drawn to this CD by ""I Want to Ta Ta You Baby"", which is an excellent song, BTW and alone worth the cost of this CD.I would recommend the following CDs to get a true measure of who she was as a singer: ""Her Best"" to hear ""I'd Rather Go Blind"", ""At Last, and ""Somthing Got a Hold of Me"".Also, don't miss her swan song CD, ""The Dreamer""."
3,Might tear,Mine already has a small rip or two (which I think happened when I moved it from my apartment to my house). I probably should have shelled out for leather.
4,sellers need to regroup,This product works great. I use it regularily. But sellers need to get a grip. I can get this product at Wal-mart for a little over $8.00. So tell me why I would waste shipping charges to almost double my cost? Thinking that maybe prime members ought to have better deals even though we get great deal on shipping.
1,not so straightening,"this didn't work well for me. since i had previously permed hair, i was terrified to leave it in for longer than 5 minutes (this is the box's specified time). my hair is still pretty curly."
1,aweful,This product damaged my hair. My hair fell out and since I have short hair I don't have much to cut off. A friend told me about this product. I think it should be removed forever. I followed the directions properly and wish I never used it. After many leave in conditioners nothing will be able to restore the damage that this product has done. I literally bought a wig to wear until my hair grows out. Do not buy
1,Didn't help,"I used this kit to try to at least get some of the frizz out of my hair. Since my hair is very frizzy and curly, I did not expect my hair to end pin straight, but I did hope to see some improvement. To me, the smell was not as bad as many people say; just about as bad as any hair coloring kit smells. I followed all of the instructions exactly as they were written, but in the end my hair is about twice as frizzy and not straightened at all. I also cannot brush my hair because the brush will not go through parts of my hair without ripping out the hair. I only lost a little bit of hair during the actual ""straightening"" process, but I will lose a lot more now if I force a brush through. From the other reviews, it sounds like this product will work for some people, but it did not for me."
1,My poor hair :(,"I bought this product and used it about a month ago - followed every direction perfectly. My hair seems slightly straighter, but it did absolutely nothing for the frizz. My hair seems to get knotted much easier now and my ends are dry and damaged (going to have to cut them off soon). But the worst part is that it made me lose A LOT of hair. When I was using the product, I noticed a lot of hair falling out. Now I can feel a lot of short stubble if I run my hands through my hair near my scalp. Obviously the product made lots of my hair fall out or break off. DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!!"
5,very insightful,"This book isn't comprehensive on the topic, but it's a well-thought-out essay on one particular aspect of modern day society.My guess is that the folks that disagree or are insulted by this book are somewhat confused because they don't identify with the mindset the author is talking about. It's definitely worth reading the book and then listening to those countless hundreds of people you walk by every day. Get out more and listen to what other people talk about day to day. More often than not, it's disturbing."
4,Good Design and easy to use,"It seems this product captures my son's attention. He did not like to be changed the diaper, but he has been willing to lie on his back after we got it."
4,Saves on Batteries,I don't consider myself a gamer but I do play more than I should. With that said I am very happy with this purchase. It has brought new life to my older games.
5,Gameboy Player Rules,"Hey everyone. I recently bought the Gameboy Player, and it kicks butt, it is so cool that we get to play gameboy, gameboy color, and gameboy advance games on the big screen! I got it, opened it up, then I put it on my Gamecube and played Kirby: Nightmare in Dreamland... and it was AWESOME!!! Anyone who wants a true gaming experience with they're gameboy games and they're Gamecube.... well this is the answer... thx for reading this reveiw. hey if anyone wants to talk IM me on AOL at BlazikenFlamez."
2,"Great concept, but falls short","Ok, i was totaly psyched about this. I got it the day of release. I am an avid gamer, own 20 plus gameboy, gameboy color, and gameboy advance games. All the nintendo systems, or most. GB, GBP, GBC x 2, GBA x 2, GBASP x 2, N64, GCN, I was absolutely stoked about this. I was convinced it would be great. The problem is, its a letdown our of the box. I dont care about the color, at all. Its nice. and if you care that much, have your console painted a complimentary color by colorconsoles.com, Anyway, i got this, and plugged it in, and eagerly popped the disk in the tray. It went downhill from there. To occupy the entire screen, you seriously lose quality, which is mediocre with the border. The images are so dissappointing compared to regular GCN games it makes it not worth playing. 50 bux down the drain, if you ask me. I never, ever use the thing. TOO BAD."
2,Incomplete,This was ordered for my daughter and it was very disappointing to know that we can't use it because the disc did not come with it :( Is there somewhere where I can purchase one?
4,it works,It took long time to get it order but this was not an Amazon problem. My son is happy with it. He can give more value to all his old games.
4,Release Date,"The GameBoy Player will be released June 23, 2003 and its gonna be the best accessory out for Gamecube."
3,OK 6/10,THIS IS NOT TOO BAD. WHEN YOU PLAY IT IT TAKE A WHILE TO GEY USED TO THE CONTROLS. BUT THIS IS STIL COOL!
2,Nothing changes!,"Well, it's great in the fact that it puts the gameboy advance game images on the big screen, but there is really no other point to it. I think the idea is a good one, however, normally if I playing my Gamecube, I'd play Gamecube games and vice versa. There is no difference in game play for any game, and you've lost the capability to move around. The graphics overall don't change, only the size. It's more of a hassle to hook up the Gamecube then to just put it in your SP or DS. This is DEFINATELY NOT A NECESSITY for a Gamecube."
2,NOT COOL,"Why in the world would you need this thing anyway? Why not just use your GBA XP instead! I mean, it's portable and you don't have to kick someone off the tv to use it! It's a waste of money. If you're not traveling, just play it on your GBA! Buy a GBA XP, but definitely not this! Well, it was a good idea of theirs, but that isn't enough to make me give 5 stars."
1,rip off,"i am here thinking i am getting the gamecube as well and the adapter because i see a picture of a gamecube and 1 just get the gameboy adapter and a broken disc. For the money i paid, this is not even worth a glance. DON'T BUY THIS"
5,The GameBoy Player is a must-have for all Nintendo Fans!,If you are a fan of Nintendo Gamecube and GameBoy you have to get the Game Boy Player. This is one of the best accessories to the Nintendo Gamecube / Game Boy Advance. It allows you to use your Game Boy Advance as a controller using the GC-GBA cable or a Game Cube controller. It also allows multiplayer of all Game Boy games even if you don't have two Game Boys. One person plays on the TV while the other plays on the Game Boy. This feature requires the GBA-GBA Link. It is a must buy for all Nintendo fans!
5,absolutely essential,"nintendo had done something very similar with their super game boy periphial for super nintendo back in the early/mid-ninties, but the game boy player easily surpasses it in terms of quality and ease of use.simply snap the player onto the bottom of your gamecube, load the disc and there you go, you're playing metroid fusion, golden sun, or pokemon, in full screen, on your television. the image is extremly sharp-there is absolutely no strecthing or disfiguration, the sound is clearer and more defined, and the gamecube controller adjusts perfectly to the contorl scheme of the games.the game boy player is highly recommended, as it boosts your gamecube library to over 1,500 games. in-freaking-credible."
5,awesome,I had been looking for one of these for a while. This is one of my favorite methods of playing gba games
5,Worth the money.,"If you're a gameboy fan and have lots of old games, get this awesome addon for the Gamecube. Just make sure if you're getting it used it has the Disc that comes with it, or else it won't work."
3,useless,gameboys are designed to play in the car. I would never play a gameboy game over a 3-D perfect colored gamecube. Why would anyone want this. [...] If you perfer gameboy over gamecube then you will like this. I might want to add that you are crazy if you think that gameboys are better than gamecube even when you can play each at a time you can play either one. There is no competition between a plug in system and a portable. [...] It folds down and allows you to easily and convienently play gamecube whenever you want. The screen is about 5 inches.
4,Pretty Good,"I would recommend that anyone buying this looks at the publication date as a lot of errata has been corrected in the most recent editions. Orin Thomas has a very useful forum http://www.certtutor.net/I originally bought this set because it offered a discount on the exams, if anyone out there is like me, then you won't get through all the material in time to use the discount on all exams. After all, the point is to know this stuff well. So far I have the CCNA and A+ certifications, I think that the key for these is to take lots of practice questions after reading the book. It's just a very time consuming process."
4,Books are great!!! Shipping sucked!!!,"The books are very informative. However, I gave this product four stars because Amazon shipped the book set in a large box and it got all banged up. Luckily the CD was still whole."
2,Not what was ordered and no replacement availiable...,"I ordered this book set and another book at the same time, from Amazon, and got free shipping. This book set came NEW as advertised. However it came with (1) 290 book, (1) 291 book (0) 293 books, and (2) 294 books. A mis-packaged set. I returned it only to find out I couldn't get a replacement - Amazon is out of stock. Now I can place a new order, from someone else, and pay $14.00 more for the same item. Not the bargain I was looking for. Amazon's response was in effect 'Oh well.' Even though I assume the mis-packaged set was not on purpose, the outcome is the same as the old 'bait and switch.' It would have been acceptable to say they would ship it when they received new stock, but that wasn't even offered."
4,I used these books as a secondairy source of information,"I've done an semi instructer led classroom training, where I recieved the Microsoft official Course books (MOC) aswell. I used these books to lookup the subjects that weren't covered in the MOC book like load ballancing and clustering.Also after the training with the MOC was finished I used this book to read up about the subjects I failed in the test exams, because this book has a different way of explaning things.I did the exams about 8 weeks apart and I passed every single exam without much trouble."
3,A lot to read,"Only got through one book, its good for what it is, i never followed through, but what i went through it looks like its a good purchase."
5,Fast and relaiable,"The shipment came really fast and I used standard shipping. All the books were in excellent condition. Unfortunately I don't really need them anymore. I have looked them over, and they are all very useful. THis is a definite buy"
3,Good but out dated,"This is a great series just make sure you get the latest version, this one only deals with SP1."
4,ogilvie foam home perm,"I have used Olgilvie home perms many times before and always have had success. My hair is fine, thin and needed body -which is what I received from this perm."
1,The curling lotion was impossible for me to use with my arthritic fingers. I could only get a small amount of foam out of the b,I have used these perms for years and never before failed to have them work. My fingers could notget enough waving lotion out of the bottle to get a perm. My hair ended up awful. Barbara Nordman
5,EXCELLENT FOAM PERM,"Hope Amazone continues to carry this OGILVIE FOAM PERM, it's EXCELLENT and so easy to use. I use it as a Body Wave and it always turns out so NICE and it's real good to the hair, it causes NO DAMMAGE! Please bring the Product back, so all of us can continue to purchase this great item!"
3,Not bad,"It is not bad. I got it specifically because it is stainless steel and has the pour spouts. The only thing heavy about it is the bottom. The sides are very thin and compared to my assortment of other stainless steel cookware the interior, brushed finish is not as smooth. If I had more choices for this size in a pour spout, s/s finish I would have probably tried another. But for what I needed it for it works."
3,Just Okay,I like the lid that provides drainage holes and the glass lid is nice to view cooking progress. But the holes and recessed lip also allow boiling water to escape too easily. And I just do not enjoy the balance or the feel of this pan. Having the opportunity to do over I would look for another pan.
5,Perfect Condition,It arrived safely and in perfect condition; I wasn't sure waht to expect since it is easy to break off the muzzle of the M1 - my family broke on my my previous one. I'm keeping this one away from them. Thanks!
1,"if this is high art, maybe i just prefer low art","first, i dig shudder to think quite a bit. pony express, to me, is their pinnacle of achievement and experiment. the vocals are amazing, with a range that would make gladys knight jealous, and the guitar is solid and well-placed, with many beautiful subtleties. so where are these two crucial STT ingredients on ""high art""? nowhere to be found! what kind of sick joke is a shudder to think album w/out their vocals and guitar?in all fairness there are a couplefew songs out of the bunch where you actually get to hear craig's gifted vocals and nathan's talented guitar playing. but that's it.so disappointing...buy this if you like anonymous, forgettable, ambient ditties."
3,So sad,"This movie was so sad, I really liked the music in the movie. After I received this cd the music didn't seem to have the same amount of depth behind it that it had in the movie. The songs are good, but you can just hear the sadness drip out of most of them. I like this cd, but it's not something I could listen to all the time."
5,Absolutely sublime,"These are songs from the era of Tin Pan Alley performed by a 16 piece band from Holland that truly loves and appreciates the period. They are, it is true, quite sad lyrically, all about love gone painfully wrong. Yet they touch such a place of the heart and as to buoy the world-weary spirit.How do these songs manage this? Just buy this and find out; I'm not competent to describe such a paradoxical reality as the damaged beauty that you will hear on this record. All I can tell you is that I once worked in a record store and every time we played this CD it was bought by people who had the most mysterious smiles on their faces."
5,Great CD,"This CD is music during the 40's era of sad, jazzy ballads. I was introduced to it in 1994 and fell in love with the style - lyrics I had never heard before. The music is lonely, yet very romantic. I heard this music while dining at a very quaint Armenian restaurant in Savannah, GA. I couldn't believe it when I saw that it was available at Amazon!"
5,Classic album. Gotta love it!,What's better than Frank Sinatra and Christmas music? Not much. Great album that is perfect for background musinc while entertaining.
2,Not so jolly as the title suggests,"While not a big Sinatra fan, I do appreciate he was one of the best entertainers of the 20th century. If you add to that what is supposed to be the most joyous time of year, then as the title suggests , one would expect this album to be full of more upbeat christmas music. In this respect the album is in contradiction to the title.Most of the songs are of the more traditional, sombre kind and in the way they are performed enough to send those who find Christmas a loneley and unenjoyable experience reaching for an artificial lift. For those people I would suggest a healthy dose of Leonard Cohen as a better tonic.If you really do enjoy Christmas & Sinatra, there are much better collections on offer."
2,&#65533;I&#65533;m All Alone at Christmas and No One Cares&#65533;,"This may be sacrilegious to many but I many but as a long time Sinatra fan I find this album to be a disappointment. Instead of ""Jolly Christmas"" it should have been titled ""I'm All Alone at Christmas and No One Cares"" Except for two cuts arranged by Nelson Riddle (""White Christmas"" and the early version of"" Christmas Waltz""), the album is dreary. The arrangements by Gordon Jenkins are somber having little if any feeling of joy to them. In addition Sinatra's voice sounds tired. He recorded two albums with Jenkins in 1957, the other being ""Where are You"" and it is obvious that his voice has deteriorated greatly since the 1956 album ""Close to You"".The two Nelson Riddle arrangements were recorded in 1954 and are full of life and the Christmas spirit. Sinatra's voice is beautiful. It is unfortunate that ""Jolly Chrstmas"" was not recorded at this time with Riddle doing the charts."
3,I Wouldn't Exactly Call It Jolly!,"I bought this from Amazon based on other's reviews. After listening to it I believe something needs to be cleared up. I found that Richard J. Roberts recent review is exactly how I feel about this CD. I love Frankie, but this CD is very slow and somber. Jingle Bells is the only song with pep in it. Beware if you, like me, like to have some peppy tempo throughout the CD and not just the first song."
2,Not what I remember,"Having listened to a couple of tracks, this is NOT the Frank I remember from live tv shows. There is something odd and tinny about his voice instead of those mellow flowing vocals. Every time they ""remaster"" an artists works something gets added that wasn't part of the original. This is no different."
4,old time frank,"pretty good classic stuff. the easter seals appeal at the end is a little dated and corny, but overall a good listen"
5,Good Sanatra,I give this cd high rateings. I have a lot of Christmas music and this rates among the top of the line
5,Must have for Sinatra fans in the Holiday Season.,"Whether you're throwing a christmas party, or just driving between shopping malls, this CD brings all the holiday cheer you need. Frank uses his distinct flavor and voice on hits like Jingle Bells and I'll Be Home For Christmas. Although his songs with Bing are great and possibly better known, these hits are definately for any Sinatra fan."
5,I Love This Frank Sinatra Christmas CD!,"I love this Christmas CD, it's one of my favorites. After I heard Frank Sinatra singing Mistletoe and Holly on the radio one Christmas it became one of my new favorite Christmas songs and I decided I needed to buy a Frank Sinatra Christmas CD for my collection and this is the one I chose and I love the CD and think I made an excellent purchase! I like every song on the CD but especially Mistletoe and Holly a song that always puts me in a jolly mood! I very greatly recommend this CD to fans of Frank Sinatra and wonderful Christmas music!"
5,This cd will make you jolly,"THE CD CONTAINS 12 SONGS THAT HAVE BEEN 24-BIT DIGITALLY REMASTERED, THUS THE QUALITY OF THIS RECORDING IS EXCELLENT. FRANK DOES A WONDERFUL JOB ON ALL THE SONGS, ESPECIALLY ""WHITE CHRISTMAS"" AND ""HAVE YOURSELF A MERRY LITTLE CHRISTMAS"". THE ARRANGEMENT BY NELSON RIDDLE IS A GOOD INDICATION WHY FRANK HAD SO MANY HITS WITH NELSON ARRANGING. THIS CD IS A MUST FOR EASY LISTENING FANS AND THOSE WHO LIKE SINATRA. OF ALL HIS CHRISTMAS RECORDING (THIS IS THE THIRD I KNOW OF-THE SINTRA CHRISTMAS ALBUM AND SINATRA SINGS CHRISTMAS SONGS BEING THE OTHER TWO) THIS IS THE BEST BY FAR. SINATRA IS CLEAR AND AT THE TOP OF HIS GAME IN THIS PERFORMANCE. IF YOU ARE A CHRISTMAS MUSIC JUNKIE LIKE ME, THIS RECORDING IS A MUST"
2,DISAPPOINTING,"If you are hoping to get some insight into Harper Lee, you won't find it here. With the exception of the interview segments with Harper Lee's sister, there's nothing worth watching. It's safe to assume that buyers of this video would be familiar with the book, so why they would think we'd be satisfied paying $20 to hear it read aloud by others, I don't know. I for one, would like my money back. TIP --- For a great video with interesting background on Ms. Harper and the book, purchase the 2006 Collectors Edition of the film, which has an excellent special feature documentary."
5,Mockingbird documentary,"Purchased this 2011 documentary to show my high school students, who were reading To Kill A Mockingbird. It shows the lives of Harper Lee and Truman Capote (""Dill"") as well as the turbulent times of the Depression when the story takes place and the 1960's when the movie came out. It also includes excellent photography of Monroeville, AL, and the ice cream place on the site where Lee had lived. Included is recent photography of the original courthouse, of which the movie set was designed. An explanation of racism in the South is part of this. The documentary contains extra interviews by Ophrah Winfrey and others. My students enjoyed the footage of high school students in the classroom discussing the novel. This product was essential in teaching students about this novel."
5,Wonderful,I had the privilege of previewing this film at NCTE in November and have been chomping at the bit for the finished product since. You will find yourself nodding along with the celebs in this film; it's like having a book club discussion of your favorite book with some of your favorite people. So grab a bowl of popcorn and prepare to reminisce and revel!
4,Great Documentary!!,"I thought it was a great documentary to show the students. I chose to show it before we read the book in order to give the students a little background information about Lee herself. However, there were lots of spoiler alerts throughout the movie that gave too much of the book away for the students, so I ended up turning it off. Next year, I may show the documentary after we read the book so it doesn't ruin it for the kids!"
4,Great book!,"The previous reviewer did an excellent job! To add to what he said:This book is divided into two halves: the historical background and events of Paul's life (240 pages), and an brief exposition of his writings (184 pages) .I bought the book for the first half because the last half, although it has a few interesting facts here and there, is very inadequate.The first half contained a number of charts, photos and extensive footnotes. It contains a history of Paul's life derived from the Bible, and historical background derived from many other sources. It gives a very good overview."
3,Paul,"The book is pretty dry but then again it's a biography. It's a good resource for school but I probably wouldn't buy it just to read. Of course if you're a diehard fan of Paul then rock on with your bad self. The book gets down to the politics of the early church which is the biggest opposition that Paul faced during his ministry. The Jewish converts were used to the Law of Moses and thought that there wasn't a chance you would be saved unless you followed those laws as well as all this new stuff. This caused problems with the Gentiles, they weren't used to these laws and didn't want the burden of them."
4,Was Useful for Research,"As a non-Mormon researcher I can say that the clarity of the views enunciated by the author were very useful to me in trying to understand aspects of Mormonism in light of the history of ideas. It is not always easy to get a grasp of the actual contour of Mormon belief on some these issues related to Temple valences, and in this way this book was superlative in helping to do just that. I am grateful to the author for writing such a clear book."
4,A tad on the thirsty side...,"It's very scholarly, which is good, but it could use some spice. The author never uses English obscenities to define the ancient ones. It's useful and interesting nonetheless."
3,OK,The book gives a background and history of the chia crop and some of its uses. Its a bit long winded and there wasn't enough of the potential medicinal uses of chia.
3,Notes on an album,"The idea that the backing tracks from Kirsty MacColl's recording of ""They Don't Know"" is a fallacy. Kirsty's record was produced by Liam Sternberg and arranged in the key of 'B' while Tracey's version was produced by Peter Collins and arranged in the key of 'C'. The arrangements are radically different and the tempo is faster on the latter. MacColl is, however, featured in the background vocals of Tracey's recording. She would also co-produce - with Gavin Povey - the title track from the album as well asThe only MacColl backing track used for a cover by Tracey was on ""Terry"", a later single."
5,Bill the great Cosby,How can you rate Bill anything less than a 5. Its clean and even my seven year old enjoys it. Bill for President
1,too little information,"In comparison to its price, the information is too basic and too little.. Please avoid buying if you already know basics of martial arts."
4,Lover's Dub,"""Circuit Court"" is a must hear. Isaacs line ""..but you wanna be too shy,"" is one of my favorite 5 seconds of music ever. He gets way beyond the love cliches for sure."
2,chipmunks are altered,"I got a vinyl record that has volume 2 on it. It has some of the songs from this CD, as well as some that are not listed on the volume 2 CD. Curious, eh?"
3,A let down !,"I'm a student, and so for a laugh I thought I would buy this CD (humorous I thought) and play to the other that I live with on a drunken night. What a let down !This CD is really for kids and if you're not one - Don't get it !One boring song after another."
5,Christmas with the chipmunks Vo1,We bought this one also for our grandson and he loves all the ones we have ordered him . thanks
3,Fun for the family,I bought this for my Grandma who had lost her copies. She loves to play nothing but this type of music during the holidays. It brought back memories of childhood. She was very happy and also my nieces and nephews enjoyed listening to the Chipmunks since they are now familiar with them due the recent movies.
5,Great item,My niece and nephew learned this song in school. I purchased the CD as a present for them and they love it. thanks!
5,Excellent covering of the Cole's vast spectrum of styles!,"Definitely one of the best ""Greatest Hits"" editions I have ever listened to. A must for or lovers of this type of music."
2,Great Selections,"Don't get me wrong when I say this, I am a ""Big"" Nat King Cole fan but his recordings on this cd are early recordings when his voice wasn't very deep. He did record these songs over and I believe these versions are much better. The songs I like on this cd are ""Send For Me"" ""Looking Back"" and ""Orange Coloured Sky"" the others i choose to listen to on another cd where his voice is much more deeper."
1,good songs but BAD recording,"I love Nat! but this album is of LOW sound mastering quality. His voice is so thin it almost not Nat. Maybe you should try other recordings...If you have fairly high quality Audio system, don't buy this CD 'cause it'll disappoint you greatly!"
5,This is a good CD,"I love almost everything NKC ever made. I mean the man just could not make a bad song, and if he had a bad song, his voice could make you love it! If you're a beginner, then this collection is good to start out with, then you'll want to buy more of Nat's music as you familiarize yourself with his vast body of work. Glad to see ""You Call It Madness"", ""Send For Me"", and ""Ramblin' Rose"" (which was Cole's biggest hit in the '60s) included in this collection. But if you're used to hearing the polished versions of ""Mona Lisa"", ""Straighten Up and Fly Right"", ""Route 66"", ""Orange Colored Sky"" or ""Unforgettable"" you will be interested in hearing these takes from the original sessions. You can hear the difference. All in all worth checking out."
4,A First Invitation To A Great Performer,"One of the delightful results of Natalie Cole's smash album ""Unforgettable"" was the renewed interest in her father's legendary recorded work. This was part of the result, an near-perfect collection of the ballads and finger-popping swingers that made Nat Cole's reputation as one of the greatest pop singers of all time (unfortunately, the second-best on his own label). I left out one star because Nat's last hit, ""L-O-V-E"" is not included, nor is the ""Christmas Song"" the sweet ""That Sunday, That Summer,"" or the last, best rendition of ""Nature Boy."" Favorite songs: ""Send For Me,"" ""Ramblin' Rose,"" ""Too Young."""
5,Unforgettable,What makes a voice distinctive and memorable? Nat (King )Cole I believe had the smoothest voice of any male singer. Clarity and a sureness in phrasing was also gifts of his. Aside from 'Unforgettable' the songs I best remember are 'Mona Lisa' and 'Nature Boy'. But this recording also includes originals of the 'Nat King Cole trio'. It also includes the famous duet put together of 'Unforgettable' from his early version and his daughter Natalie Cole's recording made after he had passed on. That particular recording was a 'knockout' sentimental and beautiful.
1,Nat King Cole,I never receave the Nat King Cole CD. I am having a hard time learning how to get my money back. I am not happy with the seller who has not responded to my email.I am have a hard time learning what I have to do to get my money returned to me. I have no item and I have I am not sure how to get my money back.
4,Solid,"All instrumental fare. Very flashy, very impressive, but not really the place to start for Thompson neophytes."
3,Packaging? A Greeting Card?,"Strict Tempo is an excellent all instrumental album. If you don't like his voice (and I do) but love his guitar playing then this for you. The remastering is louder but other than that I don't see a great deal of improvement over the original. My complaint is about the packaging. Not a jewel case, not a digipak, no this looks more like a greeting card (7 1/2 by 5 1/4). Unique to be sure but totally impractical to store. So I give this a 4 for music but a 1 for the absurd package."
1,supremely sucked,Just because a movie is disjointed and weird doesn't mean it's a great nor an artful movie. It sometimes means the movie is crap. Which is what this movie is. this was 2 hours of my life that I will never get back.
3,Alot of judgemental language used.,"I bought this book to educate myself, a catholic, about my friend's religion, jehevah's wittness. I was unable to finish the book, as it seemed to be an attack on the people of the faith instead useful factual information that can be used when talking with them. I find it hard to believe a ""christian"" wrote this book. The author lacks humility and tolerence when speaking of another faith."
2,Kittens did not like it,"This food does have very good nutrition (and is thus the most expensive), but all of the kittens (six) I fostered over three summers did not like the taste at all, and thus practically had to be forced to eat it. Three different pairs of different breeds (that I had at different times) did not like it."
3,Don't mess with Hoover and I dont mean J. edgar,"Let's face it. The director was probably overwhelmed by the talent and let control slip. The movie doesn't quite work until about three quarters way through and enjoyment of it will rest a great deal on whether you like the actors. Me? Most of them could read a relephone book and I would be fascinated. Nick Nolte is just brilliant in this and can pack a whallop with a blackjack not seen since the thirties. Not a great movie but a hell of a lot better than most that go under that name. The big car cruising with the hats aboard, terrific music on the soundtrack, an anti hero who does not take banana from anyone, and great costumes also add to the pleasure of this noir."
1,Rock-bottom film noir.,"Uninteresting CHINATOWN ripoff gives a good cast nothing to do. Director Lee Tamahori (ONCE WERE WARRIORS, THE EDGE) has seen better days, and what's up with that awful Dave Gruisin score (sounds like elevator music). What can you say about a movie that even its lead actor (Nick Nolte) admits is bad. Don't bother with this boring mess."
2,1.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A garish and ridiculous neo-noir that features Nick Nolte in full screen-chewing mode, Melanie Griffith in full awful-Melanie-Griffith mode, and some truly terrible dialogue and situations, Mulholland Falls has a good first scene but nothing else to recommend it."
2,DULLHOLLAND DRAWLS,"A handsome film unfortunately stranded with a smarmy storyline that leaves a bunch of very promising ideas unattended, unfinished, or just plain wasted. The pace is murderous; you've seen countryside post offices work faster than the detective work in this film. Hate to say this for a movie with big tykes like Nolte, Griffith and Connelly in it, but it's a clunker. Grab ""Chinatown"" instead if a classy noir suspense caper is what you're after."
4,Mulhulland Falls,"Great little mystery from the past. It was dated, but alot of fun to watch Melanie Griffith and Nick Nolte again. Do not get confused with Mulholland Drive which is awful (very dark)."
3,A modern noir!,"The script is by itself very intriguing. A crime, that attains the high spheres of the power will arise all sort of suspicious by an effective group of non traditional investigators who will play hard and face the risks to undertake the resolution of this entangled case. Cover ups, imposed limitations to find out the roots of the fact, will increase its radius of action, where the National Security is invoked in order to put all the obstacles and legal hindrances to avoid by all means to reach the awful truth.The script, given the impressive cast simply was not at the same level. Many important actors (like John Malkovich, for instance) was wasted through insipid and irrelevant dialogues which lessened the expected dramatic punch."
4,entertaining,"with a early 1950's flair, this los angeles police drama and suspense movie is no oscar winner, however a saturday afternoon a the movies would be good.also after seeing the cast;nick noltechazz palmenteribruce dernkyle chandlertreat williamswilliam petersenrob lowethey could have had more of a movie, such as l.a.confidentialthan this mess.i liked it, up to a certain point."
1,Look elswhere for a REAL movie.,"It isn't easy finding worse ""entertainment"" than this bottom-of-the-barrel tripe."
1,Awful film. What a waste!,"Stillborn, dull would-be period melodrama with an extra-gravely Nick Nolte plodding endlessly through cliched scene after cliched scene. we wonder of the stars (Rob Lowe, Bruce dern, Louise Fletcher, William Petersen) who appear in the film, but are not given credit (did they have more scenes that were cut, so they bailed?). Might as well, this was a career downer for all involved. Melanie Griffith is particularly wasted. Check out the ""streets"" as old cars are conveniently parked apart (none are close together)and the street signs are those we have today. Where did the budget of this film go? Just to the cast, who must have taken the money and run (judging from their performances). Only Jennifer Connelly is worth the one star. She is tough and mysterious, too bad we didn't see more of her. Even Chazz Palmentari's death scene look embarrassingly staged. What the hell were they all thinking???"
2,Boring and predictable.,"As a fan of film noirs, I was sorely disappointed with this film. A good cast and nice art direction can only go so far if there is no story. I've seen worse films, but that isn't saying much in the way of a recommendation."
2,"So bad, it's good.","This one's a laugh-riot. Top stars and good director, all for naught. The 1950s look is adequate (if not totally believable), the cast stale (they do more for this than this does for them), and the story laughable. It's fun to spot actors not in the credits (Bruce Dern, Louise Fletcher, William L. Petersen and Rob Lowe) as well as those known actors in small parts (Treat Williams, Andrew McCarthy, Daniel Baldwin). A waste, but still worth checking out. I personally LOVE projects like this: a well-known cast and director collaborating (along with a big budget) on a project that ends up stinking to high heaven. One thing's for sure: no Oscar nominations went to anyone involved in this one."
4,RED HOT Jennifer Connelly,"See this movie, if just for Jennifer's performance. She has a small but unforgettable part. The movie on the whole was very good, exceptional story. Above par acting. My one fault was of the lead roles, their was not one true hero. Melanie Griffith has the part of Nick Notle's wife which she play very well and you feel for her. I recommend this for those that want to study the art of movie making."
5,Awesome,Love this book. My daughter and I can not put it down. What a wonderful way to start a lifetime of crochet.
4,Emperor's New Clothes set with socio-economic issues...,"The driven Sidney Stratton (Alec Guinness) bounces from job to job as he finds a way to sneak into each textile company's laboratory where he commences his own scientific investigations in regards to a new resistible fabric. This fabric should be able to withstand almost anything and even repel dirt. However, each time he gets close to finding the solution he must escape or is taken for a mad man. Man in the White Suit is an interesting satire as it combines the Emperor's New Clothes with socio-economic issues in a modern setting. This comedy is enhanced through Alec Guinness's character Stratton who is rather eccentric and absentminded as he performs with his usual brilliance, which leaves the audience with a wonderful cinematic experience."
3,Fairly Entertaining Ealing Offering,"This film will not be to everyone's taste despite an excellent performance from Alec Guinness as the eccentric young scientist Sidney Stratton who invents a material that puts the whole British fabric and laundry business into jeopardy. There is a strong management vs. workers message here (although not to the extent of ""I'm All Right Jack""). The industrial ""closing of ranks when threatened"" works well, but the film suffers from a rather contrived ending which leaves the viewer rather frustrated (we want Sidney to succeed, despite the consequences!). The white suit also looks rather odd in the greyness of Britain in the 1950's (but maybe that was the point). Although there are some funny and entertaining moments, this is a second-rank Ealing offering."
1,Worst shopping cart and support there is!,"I spent over a month trying to get this program to work with my software. When I would try to preview the cart, nothing would show up. I had entered nearly my entire inventory. When I called tech support, they said there was a problem with how I set it up and to delete everything I had entered. I started over and entered only a couple of items and it still would not work. I tried to get help from tech support, but it was useless. They did not know how to help and their response time was awful. They refused to give me a refund on the program. I had purchased it through Amazon.com and luckily, they refunded my money. If I were thinking of buying a shopping cart program, I would stay away from this one."
1,Another fake review posted by LaGarde.,"If you believe that real users posted all of the great fake reviews then maybe you should invest in StoreFront. I once clicked on the ""5452554543532 (see more about me)"" link and it went back to a guy named Bob LaGarde who happens to be the owner of the company. What a jackass! Who does that? Goes in and puts postings of how great his company and his products are and then doesn't cover up his tracks. I think Amazon needs to remove this company's product from their website for unethical use of the rating system. It is people like this Bob LaGarde that give the industry a bad name. By the way, I checked out their demo and if you want the real story, the people who posted how horrible the software and support is are pretty accurate."
1,A $170.99 HEADACHE,"First off, I did not buy this product myself (thank goodness). I was asked by an associate to help set up this new ""e-commerce software"", because I'm somewhat computer savvy. Everything I could say about this product has already been said by others. Those that say it's great.....I just don't believe you (do you own shares in this company?). If you do buy it, have lots of patients with both the software and the tech support......you'll need it. We eventually took it back, exchanging it for something that only cost about $50.00. It worked like a dream, there was just no comparison. Expensive is not always best and that's certainly true in this case."
5,Great Support,"In this day and age of questionable/confusing tech support, it is refreshing to find a company that stands behind it's products and goes the extra mile to make sure that their customers are satisfied. Keep up the good work!-- Dennis p."
5,Great buy,Excellent TRW steel arm with quality bushings and ball joint. Didn't see any 'China' stamps / labels / or other signs of that.
1,very basic covered call information,"If you have never written a covered call of any kind this work might be helpfull to you. If on the other hand you have experience with type of investment then this booklet covers only the most basic covered call information, it has nothing new and nothing that is specific to ETF's. As an experienced call writer I was very diappointed in the content of this booklet."
2,Too light to be worth reading,"If you are new to investing, this book might be worth reading.This book needs to spend more time focusing on strategies, the justification for those strategies and analyzing hypothetical examples of those strategies so the content actually aligns with the title.The majority of this book is ""what are ETFs and how can the help you."" If you know the answer to that question already, or are willing to google it, then you time is better served finding another book on strategy."
2,Extremely basic reading!,"I was disappointed in this book as it is drafted toward a market entry-level reader who may be interested in learning the basics of Exchange Traded Funds and the benefits of trading Covered Call Options against those positions to create a steady stream of income. Profitable, yet simple strategy. Extremely basic information; however it is a good buy for the price for the novice trader."
4,Useful For Those New to Call Writing,"As noted in the other reviews, this book is for investors who are new to covered call writing. The text is an easy read - I finished the book in two hours. If you have any experience at all with writing covered calls, it is my opinion that you will not learn anything new from this book."
1,Overblown garbage!,"Overblown Californian-driven garbage. Californians have ruined my hometown -- and now they're attempting to make this weak music the ""Austin sound.""Go back to California -- and take 8.5 Tourist Traps with you!"
5,"The cover's correct now-thanks for the ""Happy Feet""!","The cover's correct now-thanks for the ""Happy Feet""! We love the cover almost as much as we love the CD!"
5,"Hot French Swing from South Austin, Texas","This album is a local gem that spent a long time on the Waterloo Record's top-ten list.Strongly influenced by Django Reinhardt, it shines with amazing guitar-work and it includes excellent vocals and a strong band. Unlike many of the modern swing bands, it feels new and vibrant - the band places its own stamp on traditional standards and adds some of their own.Check out the title track 'Happy Feet'. Their version of 'Brazil' is stunning. This is also an excellent live band."
5,The gift that keeps giving,"I received the CD as a gift from a colleague, and I played it so much in the office that she and I could almost sing harmony. This is a really hot album with a lot of energy -- lots of swing, a bit of humor, a good dose of, uh, happy feet! Nice blend of old and new tunes done up with style."
4,"Ecclectic, witty and hoppin'","I loved it. Only 4 stars because it's not long enough. I first saw this band on Austin City Limits while in the hospital after brain surgery. For a while, I thought I was hallucinating. Got the albums (I like Souvonica best) and am still jazzed--they ARE fabulous; what a sharp, breezy, excellently-humored bunch. Hey Austin ""garbage guy"" -- if you don't consider this talent, YOU need brain surgery!"
5,"I don't know what to call it, but I like it!","After seeing 8 1/2 Souvenirs on Austin City Limits last week, I ordered my first ever item from Amazon.com. They played several songs from ""Happy Feet"" on the show and I loved them all. My tastes are eclectic to say the least, but Happy Feet provides a wonderful listening experience. If I were on Bandstand, the one where Justine used to dance in the 60's, I'd give it a 95."
2,NOT the original release of Happy Feet!!,"Warning!!!!!The 1998 release is NOT the same as the original release of Happy Feet from 1995!! The female singer on the 1998 version is NOT the original singer Kathy Kiser Benayoun. On the 1995 version Kathy has a much smokier voice as opposed to the nasally sound of the voice of the woman on the 1998 release. Do yourself a favor and buy the 1995 version instead of the 1998 one, you'll be glad you did!"
1,Breakage PROBLEMS with Kohler,I bought two Kohler K-2209 sinks. They both arrived broken - one in pieces and the other was chipped. Had to pay $13 more each to get locally.
3,Decent sink,"I bought this for our bathroom, along with a new granite countertop. The sink is the perfect size for a bathroom- not too big so it leaves more counter space on our small 22x33 vanity. I like the fact that the drain is off center so there is more room in the vanity.The down side was the Amazon packaging- they threw the Kohler box in an outer box with a little paper. The first sink arrived shattered and unusable. Returning it was a bit of a cumbersome hassle because I had to physically take it to a UPS depot. If I knew that I'd have to do that I would have just picked up the sink at Home Depot in the first place.The second sink arrived OK, from a different warehouse."
5,Caxton Sinks,Highly recommend. Great size if you want two sinks in a relatively small area. Have two and bought exactly the same after home was destroyed by fire.
2,Not Impressed,"I originally ordered a perfectly made Toto sink, but it was too large and a smaller one wasn't available, so I bought the Kohler Caxton. I immediately noticed what I could only describe as a pock marked bowl. Countless blemishes under the surface, which I believe were tiny air bubbles that rose to the surface while the sink was being fired. The sink was smooth, but the imperfections were noticeable in my lighting. I called Kohler to see if this was normal for their product, and was told that it was abnormal and shouldnt've passed inspection, so I exchanged it for one of the same. Sure enough, the new one had the same markings.It's a sink, so all I expect is that it is shaped correctly and the bowl is free of visual defects/imperfections. I'm not a sink expert so I don't know how difficult it is to get a flawless look, but Toto certainly got it right.Amazon was great with the free exchange, quick refund, and fast deliveries."
2,Kohler skipped quality control,"We already have three Kohler 2209 Caxton sinks in our home, and we were ordering two more, these in Biscuit. One of the sinks arrived with two significant indentations in the sink bowl, which had to occur prior to firing in the kiln. Should have been caught before firing. Should have been caught after firing. Should have been caught before boxing. I had to send it back. Sent the other one back as well since it had minor pit blemishes in glaze of sink bowl as well. Wasted my time, wasted somebody's shipping costs. Where is quality control?"
5,pink sink,Looks nice.. Love the under counter gives much more room on the countertop. so glad we could get a older color..Thanks Kohler!!!
5,First Rate,"I agree with the 1st review! This is very good training, it provides a good understanding of real life situations and gets you mentally prepared for the worst. $ well spent."
3,Could Have Been Better,"I was disappointed again with this video from Playboy. I would expect a company that has been photographing and videotaping women to produce a better product. I have been a fan of Playboy for over 20 years so I know what their track record is. This video starts out with a couple of short clips of the actual Bikini Show in Vegas - it made me want to see more, but that was it. There is not much of the actual show. The ""Backstage"" scenes were disappointingly average. The women removed their bikinis and the camera panned up and down their bodies. Each scene pretty much had the same level of eroticism - medium. The women were beautiful - just what you would expect from Playboy. But they didn't generate a lot of excitement or heat.If you want to know what I like from past DVDs from Playboy, check out the two ""Shower Scenes"" or the ""Carwash"" scene from the ""Cheerleaders"" video or ""Double Exposure"" from ""Girls Behaving Badly""."
3,Not for Barbara Moore fans,"If you're a Barbara Moore fan you'll be disappointed. She only appears for about two minutes in the last scene. She looked okay but not as good as she has looked in the past. If you're a Dita Von Tease fan, this is a fantastic video. She appears in two scenes and looks great. The only complaint about the Dita scenes is not enough ... shots."
5,That WILLIS song is the best!,"I love this song! Its very up beat and intricate, you can teel that these boys are going far with all of that obviuos talent."
3,Answers to the Song Questions,"ok, i don't know if the people who had questions will even read this, but here are the answers...the song that they play when Josie has her flashback is ""she-bop"" by Cyndi Lauper.the song that goes ""mmm-mmm"" is ""ERASE/REWIND"" by the Cardigansnot sure about the song that she dances to, but it might be ""boom-ya"" by Ozomatli? i know that song is played in that scene.. but i'll have to go back to see if that is the right part.anyway.. if the people with the questions read these answers, i'd be really happy if you'd respond with just a ""thanks"" or ""got it"" or something."
3,many songs listed - but one still missing!,"That was a great compilation of songs not listed on the actual soundtrack, but even your list was missing a REAL GREAT song!........when josie starts to dance on stage after eating the ""special cake"" and she's bangin the drums and then her hips - i believe it even sounds ""jamaican?"" That song had a funky beat and i would love to know what it was? Please someone?Thanks"
5,TAPS INTO THE HEARTBEAT OF HIGH SCHOOL,"C'mon this is a high school movie. This is also a GREAT soundtrack. From the beginning track ""Never You Mind"" by Semisonic, this album is a enjoyable collection of soundtrack music. This collection runs from Semisonic to Swirl360 and falls back to The Beach Boys. A great collection that runs the whole nine yards! Well worth the investment and a great addition to any collection!"
4,To Golfer Chick86,"The song that is played when Josie is remembering the prom is called ""Like a Prayer"" by Madonna. Victoria Beckham also has a version of the song."
3,"Please, I Need a song from the movie thats not on the cd","The soundtrack to this movie is great. Although there is a song I need that is not on the cd. IT is played very softly at the end of the scene when she just finished talking to Guy in her room about the prom and she throws her self on the bed, the song continues into the next scene when she is walking through the hall.It's played softly so you dont really notice it as much but please i would greatly appreciate it if someone could let me know what the name and who the singer is of that song. Thank you so much!"
3,Thanx a bunch!,"Loved the movie, have it on tape, watch it from time 2 time. I jus wanted 2 say thanks to the reviewer who listed the songs that werent on the soundtrack, i was lookin everywhere 4 the Transister song. I think it's true what u said, the betta songs of the movie were left out, i reckon they should have done a 2nd soundtrack. Neways thanx a bunch.Oh yeh ne1 who needs help tryin 2 find the other songs of the film, have a look at that review."
1,Need a song from the movie (never been kissed),"Hello!In the film where Drew stand in front of her locker a boy puts ""sprite"" in her bag......at that scene there is a song that i`ll very much would like!Do you know the song?Kind regards: Morten - Denmark"
2,No one knows?,"Does anybody know what's the name of the song that Josie dances when she's high at the party? (Not the first song ""Cumbia de los Muertos"", the second one.) Thanx."
5,Great Compliation,"This CD has several different styles of music, but luckily all of the songs are good representations of those styles. I can listen to this CD eight times in a row and still not get tired of it...the beauty of soundtracks and compilations of various artists. All around an excellent CD; it made the movie that much better."
2,Song Found,"I was reading through some of the reviews and I never found the song that was playing right when Josie is named prom queen. So if any of you want to know the name of the song is ""look who's perfect now"" by Transister."
5,Amazing,"This is hands down the best soundtrack I have ever heard. Although it does not include every song from the movie, it includes many of them. Every song is good. The eclectic nature of the CD is what makes it great."
4,Fun soundtrack,"This soundtrack is a lot of fun. You should get it. To answer one of the other reviewer's question, the song where Josie is shown at the mall and other places with the ""in crowd"" is called ""Heaven Tonight"". It's by the band Hole, on the cd ""Celebrity Skin"". I have that cd, Hole is one of my favorite bands. I wonder why they didn't put it on the soundtrack?"
4,kendall payne is amazing!,"it's got the new and the old. popular and not so popular. i loved all the songs, but the definite stand out was miss kendall payne. she is so amazing. i think that we all sometimes get away from what we are and need to be ""something closer to ourselves"". it's inspiring and encouraging. i can't wait to hear more from her."
4,Moffatts are amazing.,"I was at a MOffatts concert on April 10th.....it was definitally one of the best concerts I've ever been to in my life, and I've been to tons. They played for hours on end, which was amazing, not a cheap concert. . .definitally worth my 21$ And they did a cover ""heaven let your light shine down"".......dave sounded amazing. Scott did some amazing guitar solos throughout the concert, Clint definitally worked that bass, Bob did some WHACK drum solos, and Dave sounds amazing. If they come to your city/town/area......definitally go to check 'em out.*the girl in the orange pants (in 2nd row!)"
5,JIMMY EAT WORLD RULE SMALL COUNTRIES,"i haven't actually even heard the cd, but i did heard the songs in the movie and all i really wanted to say was that jimmy eat world are awesome. i don't like the fact that in the movie they changed the words to the song. i have their cd and the lyrics saynothing about being 17. whatever. it's good."
2,What was I thinking?,"I myself hated this album, it was very boring. There should have been nore up-to-date artists/groups. I suppose if you like people such as R.E.M. then go ahead and get it but if you're a modern kind of a person, save your money."
2,what is the name of the song when Josie & the teacher are dancing?,"I never bought the soundtrack. I thought the movie was sweet, funny & romantic. Does anyone know the song playing when Josie & the teacher start dancing at the prom? Please help if you know it.thx"
3,Marchesi pupils on Symposium reissue,"The Symposium rerecordings, in my experience, have never been great (e.g. in the same class with Marston Records), but this one is much the most carefully done of any that I have heard from this label. The singing on the disc is fabulous and the rerecording good enough to make the singing enjoyable. The music is an exotic mix of the obscure (Chaminade, Massé) and the well-known (Puccini, Tosti, Purcell)."
4,the german catholic colonies of russia,"Fr. ZUGGER's book, ""THE FORGOTTEN"" covers a portion of what has been covered up in this country on the fate of GERMAN settlers in Russia. Estimates of the amount of people killed under COMMUNISM, range around 1/6 of the population of the earth.I have been working on the GERMAN CATHOLIC colonies of RUSSIA since 1950 and have a huge amount of material collected on these people. My fathers family immigrated to RUSSIA in 1767 and my mothers side in 1809."
4,Nice and Light,These are great shoes! Comfortable and really light. The only problem I had with them were I bought a size 10 and they seemed to run a little big. No big deal I'll just wear really thick socks. Otherwise they have held up great.
1,Terrible Fit,"I measured myself and bought the size that was supposed to have fit me.First of all, this product is not meant for larger chested women - I'm a C.The ""contoured"" part would only have worked if my breasts were closer together. Even when I smashed them, the belt did not fit properly. If I had bought a bigger size, the contoured area would have become even smaller as I would have had to wrap the belt around tighter. And if I bought a smaller size, the velcro wouldn't have matched up.Also, the elastic is super uncomfortable. I'd imagine if I wore this for a day, I'd have chafing marks around my ribs. It would have been nice if the outer edges were lined with a softer material."
5,Kick Back Music,"This is a really good live album, and perfect music to have in the background when you're lounging with your friends and talking about old times. In fact It's almost a morale imperitive that you have a beer in your hand when listening to it! Mike Ness Seems like the guy next door that tells you stories. This old fashioned punk rock cd is definately one of those 'must haves' for a cd collection."
4,theidey likes this one too,"social d just rocks. Mike Ness is a cool guy, He doesnt take any s*#t from anyone, he just plays his music. I'm glad theres a live one out now. The talking in between a few of the songs makes it a funny and cool experience to listen to. Boy i wish i wouldve been at that one. I doesnt get much better than these guys. The recording however couldve been better i think. The snare drum is way too loud in it. I have a crappy stereo though. A good sounding cd none the less."
4,O.C. Legend,"Listening to Social D's ""Live At The Roxy"" you'll feel the punch and energy of an authentic legend of O.C. punk. Young people might think that they are part of the new generation, because of the success that they got with the successfull ""White Light..."" and their MTV's popularity. But, after 17 years on the road, they know exactly what they do. The incredible drummer Chuck Biscuits gave the band a new and hard blood and Ness is still a loser. The album was recorded at the Roxy, the same place as another O.C. legend, Agent Orange, gave birth to the classic ""Real Live Sound"". Some songs will even make you cry, especially ""Don't Drag Me Down"", ""Ball And Chain"" and ""Telling Them""."
5,best live album ever,"WOW. This disc perfectly capture a SD live show. They tear through classics like ""Bad Luck"", ""Mommy's Little Monster"", ""Prison Bound"", ""I Was Wrong"", ""Don't Drag Me Down"" and ""Story of My Life"" with the ferocity of caged animals. ""Live At the Roxy"" is as close as you get to a Social Distortion ""best of"" album so if you're new to the band this is the one you want. Overall I would rank this a close #2 behind the nearly flawless ""White Light, White Heat, White Trash"". Let's hope that the 8 year hiatus since that album means that their new stuff will be just as good."
4,"Woa Dude, like, this is a radical live album man","Live At the Roxy is one of the best live albums ever recorded. Social D is an amazing band and its great that they put out a live album. The best thing about this CD was that they played a lot of their old songs as well as their new ones. ""Story of My Life"" and ""Prison Bound"" just blew me away. Buy this CD or else!"
5,this album Kix a**!,"With all the new %*$@# that call themselves punk bands it's nice to hear real punk rock finally. Social Distortion is great live, and this is a great live album"
4,WOW!!!!!,This movie was very interesting!! It gives us a great understanding of how the choices we make affect us and the people around us.
4,Dutch oven cooking book,"I enjoyed this book. I liked the stories. The only reason I am not giving this a 5 star rating, as I was hoping for more recipes, but good to say the least."
2,Watch did not work,"I purchased this watch for my husband for Father's Day, then I went out of town for several days to visit family. When I got back from my trip, my husband had not worn the watch because it didn't work. By the time I found the paperwork from where I had hidden it, the 14-day return limit had expired. We think it's the battery, and since we own other Seiko watches, we know that no one can change a Seiko battery but Seiko. So, this watch will have to be mailed to Seiko and a service charge paid before my husband can enjoy this gift!"
5,This is simply great folk music,"I chose this rating because of the vocal harmonies on songs like the track,Talk to Me of Mendocino. The instrumentation definately showcases their Quebec heritage. Some tracks are filled with a certain melancholy i.e. Go Leave while others show a marvelous humor such as Kiss and Say Goodbye and The Swumming Song. Although the Mc Garrigles are anglophones they do include one song in French. This is simply great folk music."
5,Kate and Anna,"I learned about Kate and Anna about 30 years ago by reading about them in Rollingstone Magazine. We've never looked back. For me, they are the best. Their harmonies are beautiful and every song on the CD is better than the one that I just listened to.If you are new fan of K&A;, listen to the song samples."
5,Sophisticated pop,"Kate and Anna McGarrigle's CD of twelve songs, first produced in 1975, is in my view one of the most beautiful and moving collections ever made. The songs are mostly about relationships with parents and with boyfriends, but there are also lovely ones about swimming, religion, travel, and the French-Canadian community. Perhaps the greatest is called 'The Jigsaw Puzzle of Life'. All the songs are superbly accompanied by guitars, banjos, piano, and many other instruments, and the harmonies are complex and often surprising. Every time I listen to the twelve songs, they bring tears to my eyes."
5,Phil Carlo's Smiling Wolf,"Have been wanting this book for awhile now and finally ordered it. If you like PI novels, Phil Carlo's Frank De Nardo series is a very good one. Mr. Carlo writes mostly in crime non-fiction these days, and those books are very good, as well. But I still like the subject matter and the way he writes his fiction. De Nardo is a tough yet sensitive to other's pain, former NYPD homicide detective, former SEAL, and nephew of a Mafia boss. He is a great character and I do hope that Mr. Carlo writes more in the series."
5,When All Roads Led to Tombstone,"I have gotten in the habit of buying any book that has Rogers' name on it. He is an astute historian, a superb writer and a wonderful editor. Gray's account of Tombstone's early years is particularly important--he was there and saw it all. Rogers' annotation adds considerable depth to Gray's story, and makes this an important book. As one who has spent a lifetime reading Arizona history, it doesn't get any better than this."
5,"LOVE THIS SOFT, FEMININE SCENT","I have been using Cashmere Mist for several years (and still do). Burberry Baby Touch for Kids is a very soft, feminine scent as well and I have had many compliments on it. It works great for a woman who wants a nice, softer fragrance that does not overwhelm. I will order again."
5,Excellent CD! (And her first release was even better!),"Mare's voice is beautiful, and her music and lyrics are at once catchy and poetic...heart-felt and giddy. I truely love this CD! However (those of you who already love this CD get your pens ready) her first release ""What Might Be"" which is now out of print is even better. I have an analog tape of it and I have honestly played it so much that it is near death. It is some of the best music I own. I bought it on a lark & have only regretted that I didn't buy it on CD (it was only released on tape except to radio stations--heresay here--and the used record store down the way HAD a CD of it which I took a pass on until too late!) I bought the soundtrack of Georgia for the one new song on it...the movie was written for Mare and Jennifer Jason Leigh by Leigh's mom. And that wonderful song Jennifer's character butchers is from that first Mare release! If you see it snap it up!"
4,Much better than Kasten would have you believe!,"All I can say is - pay no attention to the in-house 'pan' that begins this page. LONESOMERS is somewhere on the pop end of folk, but VERY addictive - once you've had it a while you tend to play it again and again, as I found this summer, and others have told me since. Mare is the real thing, she has her own style and isn't a clone of Shawn or Dar or the other obvious comparison singers. My favorite tracks are 'This Tower,' 'Silver Bullet' and the title track 'Lonesomers'; unfortunately only 'This Tower' has a sound sample here.I do think that Mare will continue to improve with further albums, but LONESOMERS is a keeper, and it's sad to see it trashed on Amazon right below the 'Buy It!' icon..."
4,Mare Winningham fan,"I first heard Mare Winningham sing in the movie, Georgia, where she played the title role along with Jennifer Jason Leigh. I could not believe that she was actually singing her own songs! I have always enjoyed her in all of the films and TV roles I have seen her in for years but never knew that she was such a talented singer/songwriter/musician as she is. Her beautiful singing voice on this CD is for anyone who enjoys folksinging. She also wrote all of the songs herself. I have purchased all of her music that she has out, including the soundtrack to the movie, GEORGIA. Enjoy!"
2,Good First Effort,"Listening to Lonesomers is like having musician friends jam in your living room on a cold, rainy evening. The songs are not slick, highly dubbed recordings. If you want raw, ""coffee house"" folk music, this is for you. This CD is not going to bust the recording industry on it's ear, however, I hope we get an opportunity to see Mare grow into her singing and songwriting abilities."
3,"15 X 36"" Easy set above ground swimming pool",I've had this type of pool for many years and many replacements. I've always purchased sets because that's the only way I thought I could buy it. (meaning the pool itself doesn't last very long and it's a beastie to set up. You have to have EXACT LEVELED ground or you'll have trouble with this pool. Since the ground is level now I can buy this replacement pool from amazon for 100.00 rather then the 300.00 something it would call for the whole set. The pump that comes with it is pretty much just a toy. I went out and bought a replacement right away.
2,No Filter,"I purchased this item thinking that it would come with a filter. The add shows 3 illustrations and one shows it with a filter. I checked the product information and from what I could see it included a filter, no mention of DOES NOT COME WITH FILTER. The add states a savings of almost $100 so you would expect this would not be a bare bones kit. I am not happy with the representation of the product and what I received. Adds like this should not be allowed."
1,Surface must be perfectly flat for pool to work!!!,"I should have read the reviews prior to ordering this from my employers gift selections. As stated in a prior review this pool will only work if it is on a completely level surface!! ARGH!! My backyard has a very slight downward grading to it, and after hours of filling this pool with water one side completely caved and my precious water flowed into our pond. I will now look for a backyard pool that has some sort of support structure built around it."
4,Good buy,Considered the12' over 15' but in the end the extra space was well worth it for cheap family fun. Also glad I bought filter separate since I feel it needs better gph than most come with.
2,Pool Review,"I bought this product to replace an existing one. The product purchased was nowhere near as durable as old product (with same name and size).Inflatable ring needs constant maintenance, whereas with the old pool once it was blown up it never again needed air.Purchased product is also SHALLOWER and WIDER than advertised. Also the inlet outlet areas for filter tubes are longer and don't allow the pipe clamps to attach securely to the plastic inlet and outlet guards inside of the pool.Furthermore the pool is made of a liner guage about 50% (smaller) thinnerthan old product. (To include the bottom and sides).Not a good buy, considering pool cose $85, and shipping / handling was $60 due to weight."
2,disappointed!,"purchased this pool for my annual ""nanacamp"" for my 6 grandkids - day 2, we find the pool sagging, and ring (around top) deflated! My younger grandkids had ""chewed"" on the side - and although obviously not a great idea - very typical of young kids...my point being - why is this ""ring"" not made of a more durable, ""bite resistant"" fabric?! I could not believe a small child could puncture so easily the plastic...we did find and repair the hole (very, very tiny by the way) and ""limped"" through the remainder of the week (temps by the way, were 100 + all that week!!!) but, sadly, will probably not be able to use another season - so, bottom line - a very expensive ""disposable"" pool...would not do that again....very frustrating!"
3,PRINCESSGRANDMA,"BELIEVE ME--IF YOU DO NOT HAVE AN EXACTLY PERFECTLY LEVEL SPOT FOR THIS POOL, DO NOT BUY IT! IT WILL NOT WORK. I LEARNED THE HARD WAY."
1,False Claims,"After buying the 36"" x 15' pool, a filter pump, a ground cloth, a pool cover and pool chemicals I very carefully watched the setup DVD three times and followed those directions. I ended up with a 26"" deep pool....ten inches lower than claimed.This purchase was a complete disappointment and from my point of view constitutes false advertising. Be very wary of purchasing any goods from this company."
2,"""mozart effect: strikes false chord","NEW YORK, Jul 22 (Reuters Health) -- The ""Mozart effect"" -- a reported temporary increase in intelligence after listening to a Mozart piano sonata -- does not hold up in repeat studies, according to a report published in the journal Psychological Science.There is ""little evidence to support basing intellectual intervention programs on the existence of the Mozart effect,"" according to researchers led by Dr. Kenneth Steele, an assistant professor in the department of psychology at Appalachian State University in Boone, North Carolina."
3,Not bad at all for its price,"I was impressed by this game since I expected so little. FreeSpace2-like graphics (meaning good) and gameplay. Ships carry some momentum (instead of always flying where they point), you have side thrusters so that you can strafe, and instead of recharging afterburners, you have a set amount of fuel for the the extra speeed. There's a lot of dialogue during the action, which can be a little annoying. Same old bad physics as with all space ""simulators"" -- limited speed, moving faster gives you more manueverability, etc. But the game's fun as long as you're looking for simple, good-looking space combat. And by the way, this is a Chris Roberts game, meaning it's Wing Commander under a different name."
4,Starlancer Review usein Windows 7 Ultra 32 Bit,"Following instructions it installed and runs,able to play on my Windows 7 Ultra 32 Bit system.My Computers Compatibility recomended to run the game in Windows XP service pack 2 mode.I also sign on to the game useing the Administrators mode.Windows 7 Ultra has that feature.The game play is good and a interesting story line that I think is worth the money."
3,Fairly decent game,"Overall, the game is good but it does lack in many ways due to it's script. Much of the storyline is scripted so during a combat dogfight, an enemy charcter cannot, repeat, cannot be killed. This is espically noticable with nikolai petrov. I had tailed him and got into the kill slot and pounded him with the main guns and screamer missiles. His shields were gone, but the armor plating would not go down below three units. Later in the game he dies just as easy as any othrer enemy.The plot variations are kind of nice. Failing to accomplish a certain objective will lead to more difficulity later in the game. Not destroying the warp gate will allow for sudden cap ship appearances later on. Fun to play, but overall it's o.k."
4,Multiplayer makes this game,"being able to play the coop missions in multi-player mode defines this game. get some friends together, set up a LAN, and you'll all be team mates fighting for the same cause. it is a great, refreshing multi-player experience that separates it from other first action shooters such as Unreal, Counter Strike and Quake."
3,"Fun missions, but not very compelling...","I recently finished this game and I have to say that the single-player hasn't left me with a great aftertaste. Unlike the Wing Commander series, there isn't any plot in-between missions, hence no character development. We're limited to getting to know our so-called wingmen through in-game dialogue. Despite the lack of a compelling story, the gameplay is still pretty challenging for the seasoned gamer and the missions offer a good variety of objectives."
4,"All the rage is ""Laughter Lines"" by SACK","Most the songs on this CD are by excellent alternative bands, but the stand out song on the soundtrack is SACK's ""Laughter Lines"". They are touring with Morrissey on his 'Oye Esteban Tour' and they are simply great. This song was worth the price of the whole CD."
4,Carrie's Sister Loves to Rock!!!,"I bought this CD for one reason only; I love the song, Crazy Little Voices! About 6 years ago, I made a movie called Saturday Night: University, and I used Crazy Little Voices as the end music, ever since then, I've loved it! I'm sure I'll like the other songs someday. I highly recommend THE RAGE: CARRIE 2 SOUNDTRACK!!!"
3,lace up vynyl corset with boning,"it looks great, the lacing needs to be longer to get to the size its suppose to be but thats an easy fix and it shipped quickly"
5,Very funny,"I haven't watched this movie in years, and I still quote it on a weekly basis. Bill Engvall is very funny."
4,Laugh till you cry,I love Bill Engvall's comedy. Most comedians are foul mouthed. I like that the cusing is minimal. This DVD is sure to make you laugh. Love it!
2,"Somewhat funny, although not his best material","I bought this DVD for my parents after having heard most of Engvall's audio material and was looking forward to sharing it with them. Although he does get into the ""Here's Your Sign"" stuff a bit, most of the DVD contains his sketches on sex and doctor's appointments. I was very disappointed, knowing the broad range of material they could have chose to make a DVD of, and I wouldn't recommend this DVD to anyone wanting a general taste of Engvall's style or content. I wish it would have more ""everyday"" humor instead of mainly bedroom-related jokes for a cheap laugh."
5,Hysterical!,"There's not much I can say that hasn't been said but I wanted to get my rating on here. I laughed hysterically the whole time and was very happy not be bombarded with profanity and sick humor - Mr. E has both talent and class. Finally, a movie I can recommend to my mother."
3,Family Oriented Humor,"What makes Bill Engvall such a good stand-up comedian is that he is everyman. His marriage and family oriented routine is something everybody can relate to and empathize with. His funny stories about married life after 21 years ring true - as are his stories about his teenage kids. Engvall's monologue is clean enough to remain family oriented but mischievous enough to be funny and edgy. Call it PG-13 comedy.The only drawback to this DVD is that I'd already heard almost all the jokes in the two Blue Collar Comedy Tour DVD's which feature Engvall, Jeff Foxworthy, Ron White, and Larry the Cable Guy. But that's okay, because you can laugh at these jokes no matter how many times you hear them."
5,Experiencing Cook's Third Voyage through images and journal entries.,"This is a beautiful book in every respect other than its rather boring dustcover. It presents all of the illustrations by Cook's artists on his Third Voyage, and links those to journal entries from the voyage in a way that conveys the impressions of the other ship's officers to expand our understanding of the artists' vision. An excellent acquisition for research scholars as well as those who just enjoy looking at these superb illustrations in an elegantly-produced format. For my much fuller review of this book see Museum Anthropology Review online."
3,The first BIZARRE James Spader movie!,"James Spader plays a guy with some issues that returns to his home town. We are never really sure WHY he came back (and neither is he) but, in the process, he changes the lives of his former best friend(Peter Gallagher), his wife (Andie McDowell) and her sister (Laura San Giancomo).The first Indie film to make serious waves into mainstream Hollywood. It is one of those movies that you watch if you want to ""mellow out"" to a movie but don't expect to have 'your doors blown off' with action, suspense or drama."
4,"Dense plotline, pretty interesting approach","This movie was very erotic without being truely graphic. It was a new approach for it's time. James Spader was very good (best actor though?), and Andie Mcdowell played the neurotic housewife well. Based in New Orleans, Mcdowell finds herself in therapy and in a loveless marriage, while her husband is confirming her suspiciouns of an affair. Then, a stranger comes to town from her husband's past and turns her life upside down. The pace is slow at times, but it pulls you through just fine. The ending was lackluster, but they had to end it somehow. If you like darker movies, with a little dark humor, then this is worth a watch for you."
4,from baton rouge director steven soderberg...,"who would've thought the oscar winning director's first movie would be about of all things baton rouge yuppies? and yet i like this movie because it doesn't rely on gimmicks or special effects, but just a good story and great acting...james spader is so used to playing heavies, it's refreshing to see him vulnerable, as you will here...secretly, some people relish the chance to be a voyeur , to live through other people's fantasies...james and andie macdowell make a very nice couple in the film...also the city of baton rouge is shot rather nicely ( examples: scenes of the garden district near LSU, the opening scene of james' character as he enters baton rouge across the mississippi river bridge )...if you pay attention to the scene where laura san giacomo is tending bar, that club is the bayou...one of my favorite pubs when i was in college....this is one of the better ""baton rouge"" films to come along recently...."
4,Do not tempt the human nature !,"A prestigious, successful and selfish lawyer , whose wife has become frigid , has decided to have an affair with his sister in law .But an old colleague is invited for him to his home in such effervescent state of things . You will discover why you do not have to experience with the feelings and desires of the human being because you as hunter may be well become hunted and being the fatal victim of your own and immature behavior.A lesson life , excellently acted with reminiscences of the Nouvelle Vague with Chabrol , Rohmer and Malle as their major influences .This film was the Opus one of Soderbergh, winner in Cannes and to date undoubtedly his masterpiece ."
3,A Strange Movie,"While I am always amazed by Spader, this is a really strange movie. It is really more psychological than graphic and you sort of lose the point of the whole thing. It was like he would rather hear someone talk about it than DO it, which I really don't understand but guess different strokes... HB"
4,James Spader Best Actor??,"The movie was good but i dont know how james spader got best actor for it..dont get me wrong he was good in it, but i guess the rest of the nomminees really sucked..i like james spader and this was one of the only things ive seen him in, besides boston legal, and the last season of the practice.. worth the money i spent on it..recommended for fans of james spader.."
4,Potent,"It's remarkable that this movie is more than a decade old and yet, its story is still as relevant and potent as nowadays. With a shoestring budget and with a basic premise of analysing the dynamics of a relationship between four persons, this movie captives my imagination from beginning till the end. The title itself can be misleading. Whilst from the outset, it's literally sex, lies and videotapes but without those issues, there wouldn't be the much needed honesty, transparency and communication that facilitate a satisfying resolve for all parties that are concerned. An intelligent movie indeed. Highly recommended. No extras in the DVD other than the set-ups."
5,Sharp and tacky,from the opening scene you just get whirled into the private lives of all four of the main characters in this video. I really enjoyed the whole scenrio and humor in this video. The predictable but powerful ending was the most entertaing part that I have watch over and over again.
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Spader's lethargy robs the film of any momentum and the conclusion seems a bit pat: it might have been the film that launched independant cinema and put Sundance on the map, but it's a mediocre film that's only occasionally interesting and too often slow."
2,What a stupid sex riot!,"This is a stupid movie, including that ""Sex, Lies, and Videotape"" reminds me about that movie called Unfaithful, I give this movie ** (2 out of 5)."
1,One of the worst films I have ever seen,"Along with LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL, A BEAUTIFUL MIND, DOGMA, FREE ENTERPRISE, and 20 DATES, this is easily one of the worst films I have ever seen.Like all of Soderbergh's films, SEX, LIES, AND VIDEOTAPE is VERY conservative. It is conformist kitch that legislates in the name of the ""normal.""James Spader is a scopophiliac who learns to give up his fetish, throws away his videotape collection, and is normalized at the end of the film.The film's politically offensive and repressive character makes it even more unwatchable than OCEAN'S ELEVEN.After SEX, LIES, AND VIDEOTAPE, Soderbergh would go on to distort, commercialize, and sensationalize Kafka's life in the disgusting KAFKA.See Schrader's AUTO-FOCUS instead!---a film that isn't afraid of exploring human ""perversity""!"
5,THE GREAT PRETENDERS!,"Hurray! It's about time The Pretenders ""Greatest Hits Videos"" is being released on DVD in the U.S. Recently only available on DVD PAL format in the U.K. and on VHS NTSC format in Japan, fans here in the U.S. will finally be able to see these fantastic videos and I think with the band's recent induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame earlier this year, WEA and Warner Bros. have finally realized that the band is still popular here in the U.S. too! I will never understand the way companies do their marketing worldwide, but it just seems odd to me that this DVD wasn't released here in the U.S. at the same time it was in the U.K. and other countries years ago. But the most important part is that the ""Greatest Hits Videos"" DVD is finally being released. I am difinetly buying this release for my music video library."
2,HO-HUM,Is Chrissie embarassed of her past? Why was so much early material omitted? The dead guys were GREAT!!! This could have been great too if it were more complete.
1,Robinson Crusoe Animated 1970,"A terrible video. It did not follow the story line at all. Poorly done animation, dialogue was difficult to understand. No redeeming features."
1,June Doesn't Swing,"I'm a huge June Tabor fan and have most of her CDs. She is a great interpreter of traditional folk music and contemporary singer-songwriters. She has a stark, dramatic vocal delivery and generally choses her songs with care and thought. What she is not is a jazz singer. Her vocals do not swing and just simply are not suited for jazz standards. Her singing on this album comes across as brittle and wooden. Her vocal range is not that dissimilar to Peggy Lee, but Peggy Lee is able to sing with a jazz rhythm and beat, while June, unfortunately, is not. Every artist is encouraged to stretch and try new areas, but I'm afraid this was a failed experiment on her part."
5,Heidi has a wild ride when a plane crashes in her backyard.,"Heidi turns from helpless to brave when an amazing turn of events happens in her own backyard. A plane crashes! At first she's distrought and doesn't know what she's doing right, or wrong. Then she meets Patrick, a trained EMT. This is a very well written book with an exciting plot and action packed events lurking around every corner. This book is an excellent find as Caroline B. Cooney smoothly explains and details this story of high drama and suspence. This story will grip your mind and fill you with the feelings and thoughts of those passengers as they crash and about the night they spend in total terror wondering if they will live,.......or die. Become one with Heidi as she undergoes a major turning of events from her everyday life and experience the adventure, horror , and sadness in ""Flight #116 Is Down."""
5,this is an AWESOME book!,"Flight 116 is down is one of the best books I have every read.( and that is alot of books) This book lets you ( the reader) show real compasion for the characters on the plane and alot of hatred for Darienne.( the passenger who thinks she was spared)Its a long, suspensefull book that takes place in about 10 hours. This is a book every booklover should read."
5,Flight 116 Is Down,"I am a middle school teacher and this is one of the best books I have ever used in my classes. My students love the action and the fact that they can actually relate to the main characters in the book. The format -- division in time increments is clever, focusing on each character's take on what is happening. Cooney has a way of drawing in her readers. This book is also good for demonstrating to students what happens in emergency situations. The terminology is accurate."
5,it was a great action packed book.,"I really enjoyed this book. It had a really good story to it. I liked how you did it in seperate stories. It had a good moral too, in Heidi's case.just try your best:)"
5,Absoulutely compelling,"A very exciting book which captures human emotions in their entirity. Ms Cooney shows humans at there best... and worst, in an exciting and suspenseful environment. Well worth a read or three."
3,boring beginning,"The first pages of this book are boring! All they talked about was how nothing ever happened in the town. Also about the characters and about facts that are not needed. The author needs to get in to the book faster so the book won't be so long. After all those pages were over it got alot better. Then it got descriptive about the crash. From about there on out the book got more entertaining. Also it showed how much a person can change in just one day. But, then it started talking about love between Patrick and that one girl. At which time it was boring again. Over all it could have been better!"
4,excellent,"i've always been a fan of Caroline B. Cooney's writing since i read Driver's Ed in the 8th grade, but this book has to be one of her better novels.I'm a pretty slow reader but i tore through this one in about 2 days. It's really gripping. The story line moves really quickly. It's a wonderful novel, and definitely well written."
5,AHHHHH!!!! SO GOOD!,"This is such a great book!!!!!! The stories are so intricately interwoven that you get to know even the lesser characters well. It is amazing, and definitely Cooney's best! I cry every time I read this book...it's awesome!"
5,One of Cooney's best!,"This was th first cooney book, that got me in her frenzy. All though her romantic books are...well let's just say cheesy. Caroline's mysetery and suspence books are awesome. This is one of the BEST books I have read in a while, If you can take the sadness, read it. I GUARENTEE YOU WILL NOT PUT IT DOWN UNTIL YOU ARE DONE!"
3,Flight #116 is Down by Caroline B. Cooney,"Flight #116 is Down is an extremely well done adventure intertwined with everyday life stories. Cooney does an excellent job displaying the fears and tragedies of an accident without putting in a lot of unnecessary gore. As you read it you will ride on a roller coaster of emotions and your attention will be held captive until the exhausting finish, making this book a classic page-turner. While indulging yourself into the pages you will meet many characters full of personality and life. Each has their own story and is in some way related to the plane in this book, ""Flight #116."" Their lives however come together when a 747 comes crashing down onto a large estate. Then all at once everyone's life seems to play a part in the survival of the passengers aboard the plane. Read carefully as you learn just how devastating an accident like this can be. Believe me, it will take your breath away."
5,"Suspenseful, on the edge action till the end!","This book was grip breath taking action. I couldn't put it down. It made me cry when Carly died and when Teddie made it on the helicopter. The book was drama,romance, and action rolled all into one! Heide was courageous and smart when making the bridges and when Daniel was stuck under the plane it was painful to read yet you just couldn't but the book down. Very,very good book!"
3,boring beginning,"The first pages of this book are boring! All they talked about was how nothing ever happened in the town. Also about the characters and about facts that are not needed. The author needs to get in to the book faster so the book won't be so long. After all those pages were over it got alot better. Then it got descriptive about the crash. From about there on out the book got more entertaining. Also it showed how much a person can change in just one day. But, then it started talking about love between Patrick and that one girl. At which time it was boring again. Over all it could have been better! I compare this book with Z for Zachariah. In both books there was a major event which included alot of deaths."
4,A Gripping Tale of Tragedy and Heroism,"I read this book over the winter (a few days) and found it quite entertaining. When a 747 jumbojet crashes in rural America, emergency volunteers and bystanders band together to help the victims trapped inside. This is a good book suitable for most audiences. Though I found some problems in the book (which is why I gave it a 4) it is still an excellent book. Must read!"
1,Worst book I have ever read...,"God, this book was bad. I don't think I have ever read a book this bad in my life. The author obviously never learned proper grammar or English in grade school. She leaves the reader hanging with double negatives and improper phrases. She also makes no sense while writing. One of the chapters in the book she wrote about a women who had an airplane chair stuck to her butt and she goes to make coffee. Another chapter, Heidi, the main character, breaks her leg on a chrome poll, not once, but twice, and just gets back up and continues what she was doing. I asked a few of my colleagues, who happened to read this book, said it was very bad, too. When I got to the last few chapters, I was so sick and fed up with this book, that I though it out my office window and into the parking lot. Reading this was a waste of my time. I want my $ back from buying this book."
2,:(,"After I had read the face on the milk carton, I was not that impressed on this book. I found it boring, and sad. This is probably the worst book she has wrote."
2,"If you like long, descriptive books this one is for you.","In the begining of the book it was confusing. The author skipped from one thing to another, alot. Also, in the begining it wasn't very descriptive. The main charaters are boring and lame. When the crash happens, excitment rises. The plane crash lasts for a few chapters. Cussing is not a big deal in the book. Although, there shouldn't be any at all! My friend and I wouldn't read this book again or another by Caroline B. Cooney. She should add fun and everyday things to the book."
4,Good Enough To Pass,"I took the 840-801 Exam. I figure that one 90 minute 55 question test is better than two 60 minute 55 question tests. The test had 3 lab simulations, and quite a few questions on OSPF routing. I had taken the cisco academy class online prior to reading this book, and I have done many labs on real cisco equipment. I feel this book is best used as an accessory to the labs. Overall though this is a good book to use as a guide to help you pass the exam. However, I would not suggest picking up this book if you have no experience with networking at all. The book covers what you need to pass the test and not so much the major conceptual knowege that I feel a good netowork tech should have."
5,Todd Lammle at his best..,"If you are studying for your CCNA and getting ready to PASS it, you need to have this book. It is very well written and is great to get prepared for your CCNA exam, you will not pass your exam using only this book though, i highly recommend you also get Ciscopress Intro+ICND, the CCNA FastPass is great to repeat stuff you already know because it's very short comparing to Ciscopress books and it has everything you need to remember pretty much, the book comes with a test engine CD, don't trust it too much, it's too easy.. BUT the book is great! Highly recommended."
4,Great fun for my 2 year old,"Our 2 year old little boy enjoys finding the pages that the animals go on. I get him to point to the animal I say, and make up other games with them as well. He can play with this for a long time, as he is obsessed with puzzles these days. My only beef is the paper on the magnets show wear over time. Also, I wish the dinosaur page was forest animals instead (deer, bears, foxes, etc), however, older children do seem to enjoy dinosaurs."
2,It says it is for toddlers but it's not,One of the other customer reviews of this toy said that the pieces were impossible to keep with the book--I should have listened. The book's illustrations are great but the pieces are a nightmare to contain. I put the book high on the bookshelf. Not much fun for a toddler up there.
4,Excellent,"This book helped me to better understand how to apologize in such a way that is communicated. Through reading this book, I discovered that the way I was offering an apology was not received as such simply because of the way I chose to say ""I apologize for hurting you."""
4,"Good book, Sorry, I was Wrong, I'll fix it now, forgive me...","Good book, Sorry, I was Wrong,I will try very hard not to do that again, I'll fix it now, forgive me... Chapman says use all five and you are bound to be talking the listeners Apology languages. It was another great book by Chapman.Swayne"
3,Not Love Languages...,"This book did not live up to my expectations after reading ""The Five Love Languages"". I would rate it a 6 on a scale of 10 positive. It used far too many illustrations to make the point and made reading it more a labor than a joy. It could have been published in fewer pages and carried greater impact because the points are valid."
5,Apologies,"This book is extremely helpful. Sometimes we have apologized to someone yet that person feels we have not apologized. This book will help sort out this dilemma. The authors talk of five different levels of an apology. Each of us has one way of hearing a sincere apology. I personally need to have the person who wronged me state that they were wrong and be specific about owning their mistake, not just that they were sorry I was hurt. I also need the offender to try to make it right-restitution, and then tell me how they plan to avoid this offensive action in the future. Not everyone needs each of these components to feel the apology is complete. The book addresses each component in detail with plenty of real life examples."
5,five languages of love,"This is without aa doubt the best book I have ever read, I learned about myself and others it is great, when I get married I will use everything in the book."
3,Kind of boring,"I thought this toy would be a hit with my 2 year old. I was wrong. She picked it up once, messed with it for maybe 3 minutes, then was done."
5,"beautiful, quietly storming pop","if you want to be way ahead of the pack in discovering bands that will, down the road, make a terrific impact, buy this and prepare for bliss. one of the funniest things is when people who DO know Ray try to classify them--they can't. ""Deep Blue Happy"" through & through is so melodic, so moving, & so un-peggable. you have to resort to trippy, poetic terms like ""undulating"" & ""quietly roaring"" & stuff--they don't really sound like the good good bands they have been compared with like LUNA or KITCHENS OF DISTINCTION or whoever. the guitars soar and glide, the songs are sophisticated but not wanky, & the vocals are honey-beautiful. ah, what else do you need! get this!"
4,Good Mats,"They are just as advertise and I'm happy with mine. They look great. Only thing is they're smaller than your factory floor mats. But you cant go wrong with the RAIDERS! I have them in my 06 Mustang GT, but I originally purchased them for my SUVs."
3,not bad.....not great,"they look really good, but they sound just okay. whatever's in them is rather large so the sound is much 'duller' than i thought. although if you experiment with different angles you can get a slight improvement."
5,Another great read by Col. OLIVER North,Great story and plot set in The Middle East. The different military and intelligence units in the story show his resume. I like how religion is obtained with good vs evil throughout the book. Like the old Saturday western movies with the good guys winning against overwhelming odds. Lots of action and suspense to keep readers interested and it really worked.
3,Ollie Needs an Editor,"This was my first romp through an Oliver North book. At 500 plus pages I found a story that was a fun read (I wouldn't call it a page turner ala Daniel Silva) but overwrought. Ollie is a little too preachy (pedantic) for my taste.A good editor could have made this book the ""page turner"" that other reviewers claimed it is. Since that didn't happen, the reader will have to wade through repetitions and character and factual inconsistencies to get to the story, which would have been more fun at 400 to 450 pages."
4,4 1/2 Stars....Mr North Does It Again!,"I very much enjoyed the first book by Mr. North, Mission Compromised. This sequel proved just as enjoyable to me.The authors take turns as surprises, suspense, and technical know-how bravado, intriguing the reader, and making them want to learn more and read more about military procedures. This novel makes a great addition for anyone who likes Clancy, Ludlum or Patterson.I have a discussion about this book on my website forum at www.aints.net.I would recommend this book to anyone who likes well-written military thrillers. I am looking forward to the next edition in this series."
4,The Jericho Sanction by Oliver North,This book was an excellent read. I read it over Christmas break and couldn't put it down. I was finding excuses to hide from the family so I could see what happened next.
4,These ribbons aren't bad.,"These ribbons aren't bad, but the are very simple. There is no place to write details for the winners on them."
2,What'cha gone do,"Is this Tony from ""who's the boss?"" All dieseled up and focused on making certain that he isn't playing with the FEDS.BAD BOYBAD BOYWHAT'CHA GONE DO?WHAT'CHA GONE DO WHEN THEY COME FOR YOU?In this Docudrama we watch as Gus Farce a murderous drug dealer becomes expendable to the MOB as well as the few friends that he had.For this to be a mob movie it was very little action. You got more of a glimpse of what the FEDS/cops do in order to entrap fugitives.As gangster movies go, this is one that is more of a cold chill and not because it's action packed!"
2,Dead and Alive is an oxymoron!,"Having contributed in some small way to the making of this movie, I found it barely resembled the original cut. The excessive editing destroyed the continuity and artistry. I found the producers attempt at retitling and billing Samuel L. Jackson as the star... Gus Farace, to be shameful! Tony Danza plays the title role in this movie and Mr. Jackson is not even a first billing in 1992 when this movie was shot. Where is the integrity?"
3,too pricey for the quality...,"i am looking a thick, nice, big diary to write. Im glad i could find this journal which i could not find anything else with the requirement i need. and once i see this journal and got the price soooo high, i dont care i just purchased it and got it today, and yup, a little disappointed but after long search through many book store and online shop, this is the best i can get. the paper quality inside are good and very nice looking, the leather cover looks fine but cheap, im sure its not real leather, because the custom in japan would ask me to pay for leather quarantine... over all, this journal will make my day today. i hope the bundler will last longer than i thought. because this is really thick!!! and i dont see the good finishing from the manufacturer... maybe i must pay extra attention to have this journal forever... its expensive!!!"
4,"All the hits, for a reasonable price","There may be more comprehensive collections for the type of listener who wants B-sides, alternate takes, and the like, but this compilation is quite satisfactory for me, a casual Hollies fan, since it covers all of the the Hollies' 1960s hits. More importantly, it also seems to be the only collection, comprehensive or otherwise, that includes my favorite Hollies song, ""I Can't Let Go."" Ten tracks may not seem like a lot, but the price is also on the low side, so it's not an egregious rip-off."
1,Help Wanted: Editor - Part 2,Sorry. I mistakenly said in my review just submitted that the author spent 3 yrs living in the Aran Islands. He actually spent under just one year. He had been there 3 years previously. Sorry for the mistake.
1,Help Wanted: Editor,"The first chapter is very good. The last chapter is excellent. It's the 200 pages in between that are problematic. If you suffer from insomnia, rush out and buy this book. The only thing that kept me going is that I have been to the Aran Islands --... The story line skips around and seems to have no continuity or narrative flow... I still don't understand why the author, at college age, spent 3 years living on the island... What an odd glop of uninteresting stories, poetry, observations on corncrakes, and education on fishing lines and rabbit hunting. I did learn some new vocabulary words, though. Like ""monody,"" which might be the kindest way to describe this book."
3,Losing the edge,"Got to admit that I was a major fan of this group after the first AudioSlave cd. Then Out of Exile which had just a little bit less energy. And Revelations, well, just as well they break up I suppose. Chris Cornell's name is up on the marquee over at Denver's Filmore. I just wonder if these guys knew what a good thing they had going? I salute AudioSlave for what they once were!"
5,Revelations,Excellent choice! this album compliments the first two. Durable stereo speakers with increased volume capacity are necessary to receive this experience.
3,New Audioslave listeners: Don't listen to the first 2 Cd's,"OK their search for their own ""sound"" should have stopped at the 2nd CD. I don't see what was so wrong with the Rage-with-a-guest-singer feel of the 1st CD. Anyway I'd have liked to see Rage play ""Getaway Car"" or ""I am the Highway."" So yes, if you are a new fan because of ""Original Fire"" then don't listen to the first 2 Cd's, they sound nothing like this. I think if I did't have the preconception that Revalations woud sound like Cochise, I think I would have liked it better"
1,3+1=0,"So Rage Against the Machine tapped Cornell to sing for them. Ok, fine. Then the first album or so basically sounded like RATM playing with Cornell singing. That at least makes sense.Now what was one of the hardest, most intense bands out there (audibly as well as politically) is making music for my 60-year old dad.If were some nobodies on a stage in a local tavern or something I'd say ""Ok, these guys are 'ok'"" then I'd leave without buying their CD. This is danceable, commerical-shopping-mall rock. How this was born from these individuals is beyond me. Three members from RATM plus the amazing singer of Soundgarden = useless.(And it's getting so funky I keep expecting Cornell to start rapping)"
2,Below expectations,"After two CDs that were great and even better, respectively, one would think that their 3rd effort would even surpass them. Sadly, no. This CD explains why the group disbanded. Sigh..."
4,Glad I picked it up,"I wish I had picked this album up sooner. If you liked ""Out of Exile"" or their self-titled album, go get ""Revelations."""
2,How about some variety?,Chris Cornell is the best hard rock singer in the business - now that Robert Plant is semi-retired. His work with Audioslave HAS NOT matched his music with Soundgarden - it has been a major disappointment. Each CD regresses despite new production tricks - every song is intense hard rock and all the songs run together and sound the same after a while. Where are the shades of gray we heard in Soundgarden and even on his solo albums? The guitarist is highly overrated - he seldom (if ever) plays a melodic solo and his psychedelic riffs are tiresome cliches. This CD may be good for head bangers and someone wanting to hear bleak and depressing lyrics. For someone who wants to hear a diverse hard rock band - look elsewhere. The latest Wolfmother CD is even far better than this junk! Chris and company - you are losing me fast!!
4,Wish I liked it more.,"A long-time fan of Soundgarden and Audioslave, and Rage Against the Machine somewhat, I looked forward to hearing this album, expecting to be blown away. All of the songs are just fine, there's nothing wrong with them, and yet I'm not thrilled. It's just okay. I'm very disappointed that this album isn't fantastic."
4,AUDIO SLAVE,I PURCHASED THIS CD BECAUSE OF A SONG I HEARD WHEN I WENT TO THE OPENING OF THE MIAMI VICE MOVIE IT WAS NOT INCLUDED ON THE MOVIE SOUND TRACK HOW ODD! IT IS ONE OF THE BETTER SONGS
3,Revelations,"Revelations being Audioslave's 2006 release and their 3rd studio album and came with such hits as ""Original Fire"" and ""Revelations"". At the same time the groups lead vocalist left the band and disbanded 2007. The cover is really nice but the decision to have the title upsidedown seems strange. The booklet has standard rock photos and the lyrics are easy to read. 3/5."
3,"Well, two out of three ain't bad.","If you're looking for another balls-to-the-wall Audioslave album with heavy melodic riffs and thunderous songs, this probably ain't gonna do it for ya.This is fairly mellow compared to the previous two Audioslave CDs. The songs are decent enough on their own but pretty pedestrian compared to the best parts of the first two records. There isn't another ""Show Me How To Live"", ""Your Time Has Come"", ""Set It Off"", or ""Cochise"" here. Not much to really drive this CD to the level of greatness of their previous work. There just aren't enough interesting melodies.It is definitely the least satisfying disc of the band's catalog.Hate to say all this too, mostly because I've become a big fan of the band and want to feel predisposed to liking whatever they put out.But ""Revelations"" ultimately disappoints on a few levels. Betcha you won't disagree."
4,"A good, solid effort","It's a very good, solid rock album indeed. But my favorite from them is their first."
4,Great Album,"this is an amazing album not as hard as the first album, but more rocking than the second if your a fan of audioslave you'll love it has more of a bass and funk beat to it and chris's vocals are amazing!"
5,This Album Is Fantastic,"Every song is amazing. The band is truly at its peak with this CD. The bass, the guitar, the vocals, the drums are all dead on in delivering an incredible listen. Tom Morello continues to tread new ground with his solos, Tim Commerford has a stellar performance on bass, and Chris Cornell sounds as good as ever. Despite what other people are saying, I believe this album is much better than their first two. It seems they have finally found their sound and I hope they stick with it. If you are a true Audioslave fan (yes, that does include liking both RATM and Soundgarden), you will not be disappointed."
5,No one comes close!,"Audioslave is the best hard-rock group out there today. No one else even comes close. All 3 discs have been diverse, and some say that the hard edge is gone. Personally, I don't want every single song to sound exactly like Rage. The band is coming into it's own, and developing a unique sound. There's the harder-edge songs like ""Moth"" (my favorite on the album), and the funkier sound of ""Jewel of the Summertime"" and ""One and the Same"". The more times you listen to this album, the more it will grow on you. I truly hope these guys stick around for a long time!"
2,A dissapointing departure.,"Long story short: I was dissapointed with this album. I felt it was a bit too pop influenced and seemed to be an effort to cater to a more ""accessable"" sound...TOP 40 radio and Audioslave just don't belong together! Funk/Red-Hot Chili Peppers type thing goin' on just didn't do it for me. I kept waiting for the down and dirty rock sound of old, a-la ""Cochise"" and...save for ""Running From the Sound of a Gun""...it just never shows up. I loved thier first two abulms but was so bummed about this third one that I literally sold it off to a used CD store after having it a few weeks."
1,You people must be deaf!!!,"This album is terrible. It does not rock. I kept hitting the ""next track"" button, trying to find rock, but alas came up empty. You can probably write these guys off. There's no more rage in the music (pun intended). The first one is a classic, too bad they had to blow it. RIP.Go pick up the new Motorhead or Slayer instead."
5,wow,"Listened to the cd last night straight through. I don't think you can appreciate how amazing that is.. I've had so much bad luck with buying cds lately! The songs are really catchy and for the most part the guitar solos fit (exciting eh?). I really did not like Out of Exile and this sounds nothing like it. Cornell's voice is in top shape and sounds amazing. The only weak song on the cd that I am already skipping over is Original Fire, everything else is so much better then that. If your an Audioslave fan of either cds go out and buy this one - it's worth it."
2,Audioslave Revelations,I did not like this album as much as their first two albums. All the songs sounded similar to me.
4,"Good, Solid Radio Rock","I always thought the singer of Soundgarden was the best part of the band; Nice to hear some really good straight ahead rock w/decent lyrics, musicianship, and production. Kind of old school with a welcome modern touch; These guys are only going to get better with each album. Hard to go wrong here. Sure, it's ""mainstream""....but it's great mainstream."
4,My favorite Audioslave CD,"This weary band pulls it together and puts out a record that just rocks from start to finish. Nothing fancy, no artsy fartsy stuff, just straight up rock n roll. Reminds me of Deep Purple with Coverdale. Don't analyze this one, Just enjoy the rock."
2,Very little content,"Although the demonstrations of techniques are good, be aware that 25 minutes out of only 40 is an interview with Avi Nardia and Albert Timen. The ""third party protection"" advertised on the cover takes up all 4 minutes on the DVD."
2,little information,"Like volume 1 of the series, compared to its cost ( compared to many other instructional DVDs of other martial arts ) this dvd is expensive.Creation of this dvd is a joint effort by 3 people but i would say that the informations, techniques presented by only Mr. avi Nardia are good. that is the only plus point."
5,East Tennessee Ph Balance Lover,"Since the begining of time the human race has longed for music that encompasses the many emotions in our lives. Well, the album that mixes all emotions into one CD has finally arrived! This band has produced sounds that will apply to every aspect of your life, and leave you with a smile."
2,Other and better possibilities out there,"As theology and preaching goes, there are better books available for the clarity of theological engagement and the aptness of the argument. Burton Cooper and John McClure, Claiming Theology in the Pulpit, hits a homerun with students and scholars. I highly recommend their book as successfully accomplishing what Allen attempted in his work."
4,Of course it was funny !,"Emilio Estevez is almost as funny as his brother Charlie was in the ""Hot Shots"" series. Forget about SPOILERS! Who cares? Two of the funniest scenes for me was the interrogation of Miss Destiny Demeanor (Kathy Ireland) of the Sharon Stone - Basic Instinct parody. In which she continually crosses over her legs, while in a chair, with the attendant crowd of detectives sitting in ""bleachers"" waiting to catch a glimpse of her ""you-know what."" Finally, you see a beaver materialize in the style of a ""Caddyshack Gopher.""And then the shootout that York (Estevez) and Luger (Jackson) come upon while looking for a suspect; with the ""Chips"" guys, Ponch and John (who never pulled their guns out during the real show). The shootout is so loud and intense that Ponch has to shoot at John (narrowly missing him) just to get his attention.Too many sight gags to list, that'll bust you up. Funny, funny, movie with loads of cameo appearances."
4,"Collect cop cliches, mix. Hilarity ensues.","Lampooning everything from Lethal Weapon, to Die Hard, to Basic Instinct, this movie puts together all the cop-action movie cliches you've ever seen, throws them in a blender, and shoots them at you with a liberal dose of humor."
4,Great Comedy,"John in his reveiw here has just said exactly what i was going to say! So I dont need to review this myself, he's already done it for me, word for word!I will add however, if you happen to own this great comedy spoof/parody movie, you might be intrested to know there is a couple of eggs hidden on the DVD! If you go to the biographys and choose Samula L.Jacksons, as you flick through the pages, you will notice some of his movies have gold bars around them? You can select those bars, and click ok and watch the trailers to some of S.L.J's movies!My words on this movie that John didnt add. If your into comedy spoofs like ""naked gun"" ""airplane"" ""kentucky freid movie"" ""spy hard"" ""hot shots"" ""silence of the hams"" and movies of that type of goofy parodying, then you will love this movie! See Johns reveiw for what movies get parodied"
3,IT WAS FUNNY,"TWO COPS [EMILIO ESTEVEZ AND SAMUEL L. JACKSON] TRY TO STOP THE DISTRIBUTION OF COCAINE LACED COOKIES. THIS MOVIE SPOOFS MOVIES LIKE ''LETHAL WEAPON'', ''FIRST BLOOD'', AND ''BASIC INSTINCT''. HAS ENOUGH FUNNY MOMENTS TO MAKE THIS AN OK COMEDY. HAS A STAR STUDDED CAST. AMONG THOSE STARS ARE; WHOOPI GOLDBERG, JON LOVITZ, WILLIAM SHATNER, F. MURRAY ABRAHAM, AND MANY MORE."
4,Very good slapstick,"This is a VERY good spoof/slapstick movie. Like the Airplane and Naked Gun series, you'll see something new every time you watch it. This is a dead-on hit."
5,Get one before it's gone~!,"Hey, do you need to read this review?Go to the video section and just buy it. You will never regret it. It never got the recognition that it deserves.Even today, I plug this tape into my VCR for a pure 90 minute laugh. I could say that it's funnier than those Naked Gun series.Buy~!"
3,A Spoof That's Not As Funny As What It's Spoofing!,"Loaded Weapon 1 is a spoof of cop action movies, particulary the Lethal Weapon series. And if I remember correctly, the Lethal Weapon series was actually funnier than Loaded Weapon 1. Don't get me wrong, Loaded Weapon 1 did wring some laughs out of me, but not nearly enough. It's a spoof that's more High School High quality than Naked Gun or Airplane! quality."
5,National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon 1,"I owned this movie years ago but time has a way of making movies disappear. It was imperative to replace it . This movie is a cornerstone of the spoof genre, with an almost constant barrage of crazy one liners. From the gripping performances of Emilio Esteves and Samuel L jackson, detectives Colt and Luger, to the steady stream of cameos and bit parts by William Shatner, Dennis Leary,Kathy Ireland, Whoopi Goldberg,Tim Curry, Jon Lovits even Bruce Willis. This movie is a must for any fan of disappearing spoof movies."
4,A spoof of Leathal Weapon.,"This spoof of the Leathal Weapon series is indeed funny. Emilio Estevez, son of Martin Sheen Sr., and Samuel L. Jackson work well together as a comedic due of detectives in this riotous, crime busting comedy. Cameos of Tim Curry, Whoopie Goldberg, and William Shatner are outlandish and sidesplitting!"
4,Not for everyone,"If you're not into humor DON'T BUY THIS! If you didn't like Young Frankenstein or AIRPLANE! then this isn't your kind of movie. Otherwise, you can watch this 5 times and STILL pick up new gags. The comedy writers of this movie were busy and it shows. Great parodies of MAJOR cop/supsense movies, quips, site gags, good comedic acting... this is worth the cost and time. I don't know what the critics said but who cares. I still laugh at this movie. I put this up there with [or at least near] Young Frankenstein by Wilder/Brooks."
3,great comic movie,"this is a great classic movie, it has a lot of comic scenes, and it makes me laugh a lot, i recommend it to anyone who wants to have a good time with his friends and see a good flick."
4,Funny !,"I first saw this movie was I was ~ 14 .Now I'm 20 and I still love it - mostly because of Samuel Jackson and that guy with fantastic german (?) ""aññent"" .""Where is the micGrofilm , mr. Colt ?"" ....If you like comedies and parodies - that's a great choice !"
4,The evil twin of Lethal Weapon,"Great movie if you like older comedies where actual jokes replace constant sexual inuendo. Takes the comedy/action aspect of Lethal Weapon and spoofs it, making sure to shoot the Joe Pesci style character as much as Leon Getz truly deserves. When you need a movie to ignore the fact that you have 4 papers due for college the next day, this is the kind of spoof that really helps you out."
3,"Good, but a bit of a let down","This is a very funny spoof of not just Naked Gun and Lethal Weapon, but every other movie in the genre. There's so many, I've even noticed a few that I missed the first few times I watched it.I would have given it 4 stars, but the DVD is a let down for those who have seen the movie in theaters or on TV. Like too many others do when transfering to DVD, many scenes have been cut out. Often, these missing scenes are not missed, but with this movie, all of the parts are good ones and in some places, were essential to the movie making for some confusing lines later on.Still, I think this is a very funny parody of action movies and is worth the time."
2,Overdone,"The National Lampoon folkes missed the mark with this one. Most of the jokes fall flat, and the acting is terrible. I love the ""Vacation"" series, and do not know if this flop was due to bad writing or bad acting, or both. It takes a lot of effort to sit through the entire movie."
3,They Have Guns!,"""Loaded Weapon 1"" is basically the same kind of movie as the ""Naked Gun"" series, only not as funny, making this just a mediocre comedy. Also because I have not seen the ""Lethal Weapon"" movies either. I'm not saying this isn't the least bit funny. It was actually pretty funny. Maybe because of Tim Curry's odd cameo. He's got a funny accent and he's eeeeeevil! ""Jigsaw"" is his name. Sargeant Jack Colt and Sargeant Wes Luger have to stop him from distributing Wilderness Girl Scout cookies that are really cocaine cookies, and he was after a microfilm that had the recipe on it from the 2 cops after they get it. The showdown ends up in the cookie factory. This film also has a very small cast, and that's about it for the whole plot and such. There's not much else that's left to tell. Good day, then."
3,Leslie Nelson type comedy,"Filled with sight gags and spoofs of other movies, including ""Lethal Weapon"", ""Silence of the Lamb"", and many others. Two policemen (Emilio Estevez, Samuel L. Jackson) try to stop thugs from sending Girl Scout cookies around with cocaine in them. Funny at sometimes, but get's old at some points. Also stars Jon Lovitz (who is hilarious as always), Tim Curry, Kathleen Ireland, William Shatner, Charlie Sheen, F. Murray Abraham, Denis Leary, Phil Hartman, Whoopi Goldberg, Corey Feldman, Larry Wilcox, and Charles Napier."
4,Love the movie,The movie (although it's old school) was in great condition when it arrived. I had to add it to my collection of favorites.
4,Outstanding introduction to musical theater,"This is a wonderful collection of songs, some of which aren't heard very often any more (especially the delightful ""Once In Love With Amy"" which was previously unavailable on CD). It makes for a great intro to the genre, and I'm pleased that it has prompted other listeners to explore further.As others have mentioned, the biggest plus to the discs is using original casts for all but two cuts (Judy Collins' ""Send In The Clowns"" and Arethra Franklin's horrid ""I Dreamed A Dream""). Sure, there are excellent shows that aren't represented, but people need to realize that BMG/Arista is only going to include the songs that are already in their catalogue rather than negotiating rights from other labels. Even with that limitation, it's definitely worth owning."
5,An Album fit for a Queen!,"If it's good enough for Obama to give to the Queen of England on the gifted Ipod, how can I NOT give it a 5 star rating?"
5,A Newbies Intro To Broadway,"This CD is the ultimate! I have been a lover of the musical theater for years and wanted a good CD that would inspire my wife to love the theater as much as I do. Last week, I took her to her first Broadway show (Phantom) and I had to pry her from her seat when the show was over. When I saw this CD I simply had to have it to share the other great musicals with her. To say the least she is hooked. I WANT MY CD BACK....."
4,"Overall, quite good.","This is really a good selection. You can't go wrong with 'West Side Story', 'Man of La Mancha', 'Fiddler on the Roof', or 'The King and I'. I guess you can always argue why two songs from one show were selected, while another show may be completely omitted.My only real disappointment is with the selection of the Aretha Franklin version of 'I Dreamed a Dream'. The song is too stylized by Aretha, and sounds nothing like it is performed in 'Les Miserables'. I didn't care for this version in the least. I would have much preferred Randy Graff or Patti LuPone."
2,Only OK,"Ella signs beautifully, and the sound quality is fine, but the backing music is very generic, and the CD only contains 20 minutes of music. A curiosity but not a must-have."
4,Quelques Rose Eau de parfum,"I was looking for an inexpensive replacement for an Italian perfume that I no longer could find, ""Santa Rosa"", a light and delicate pure rose essence that didn't overpower but just gave a soft scent of pure rose. I had originally purchased it on a vacation to Rome, and had found it in NYC at a small perfume shop in the East Village. But I haven't found it anywhere near home. I ordered 'Quelques Rose"" by Houbigant as a replacement. It's a nice ,light rose-y scent but doesn't have the purity and clean rose scent that I was hoping to find - but it is a nice perfume. I'm still looking for the right replacement."
2,Pan and Scan,"It's been reformatted folks - you don't get the full picture. There's nothing in the published specs to tell you that (as the early Disney animateds were originally 1.33:1), but you're missing 25% of the picture here. Wish I'd noticed the itty bitty print on the back before I broke the seal."
5,The greatest legend of all time becomes a Disney classic.,"""This tale begun when England was young, and knights were brave and bold."" began the greatest attempt Disney ever made at turning classic literature into a motion picture. Excellent songs and characters fill this Disney great. I can't believe it doesn't get the credit is deserves. I believe now a days Disney has lost its touch of its once glorious animated films. Sword in the Stone will always, in my mind, be a classic of movie-making."
5,One of the best Disney movies ever!!,"I LOVE THE SWORD IN THE STONE!! I'm 15, and it's been one of my absolute favorite movie ever since I was a kid. I'm so happy that its come out on DVD! To me you can't help loving it, and you certainly can't stop loving it even when you grow up. Its absolutely hilarious! Who could possibly argue with that? The songs in it are very catchy, the characters are unforgettable, and its a great twist on the traditional Arthurian legend. It may not be one of more famous Disney movies, but to me it is one of the best."
1,I Do NOT like this film!,"This is one of my least favorite Disney films! Everybody keeps picking on this poor kid, Arthur (no I am NOT calling him Wart like the other jerks in this movie!). Everybody keeps confusing him or bossing him around! I am glad Merlin's lessons distract him from those other things in the castle, but what right does HE have to force Arthur to take lessons! I also hate Sir Ector! He's obviously like Uncle Vernon from ""Harry Potter and a male version of Lady Tremaine; favoring their own biological kid while treating their UN-biological kid like a slave or absolutely nothing! George Bruns's music is also his most forgettable and bland out of his five films. The only thing I reccomend in this movie is Made Mim's wizard's duel, but it is not enough to save this stupid animated film! I am not buying this, ever!"
4,Fun retelling of the Arthurian legend,"The legends of King Arthur are rich and varied - I'm sure we've all heard of some of them - the Knights of the Round Table, Queen Guinevere, and all of that, but this movie happens before the kid becomes King. Arthur is a lanky young teenager who has no idea that he's destined for anything special...While this film is supposed to be set in the the time Arthur was supposed to have lived, there is some modern-day speak, and Merlin has a modern-day attitude (or at least, what was considered modern-day back then when it was made) but come on, this is a Disney film. If you expect a comprehensive summary of the Arthurian legend, you won't find it here, but this is a highly enjoyable film, especially when Merlin spends time with Arthur and they turn into various animals, or when Merlin duels with the witch (certainly not Nimue or the Lady of the Lake!)Overall this is a fairly fun Disney film, and I definitely enjoyed it."
4,"A fun, classic Disney film","I still know plent of people that have not seen this. Now, I know it is fairly old, but it is still a wonderful movie. I have seen it loads of times and I really wish more people would see it and not immedietly discard it. The animation is quite good and the voice acting is top notch. I love the story too, its pretty timeless and if you love the King Arthur Legend, then this movie is for you."
3,The Sword in the Stone,"For some inexplicable reason, Amazon has removed the rate-movie feature from the main product page. One must now write a review in order to rate a movie and generate recommendations. This is not a review, but merely a means to allow me to rate this movie and improve my recommendations. If you are as annoyed by this new ""feature"" as I am, please register your protest w/ Amazon help."
2,Scratched disc,"For Christmas I bought the Sword in the Stone for my little sister. It's one of her favorite Disney movies. Unfortunately the disc was scratch and almost unbearable to watch, despite the sellers claims that it was like new and in good condition. Bummer."
2,Mediocre,"This was not one of Disney's best films.The songs are mediocre,the visuals are bland and the plot lags.This film pales in comparision to Disney greats like ""Jungle Book"" and ""Cinderella."""
2,NOT DISNEY STANDARD!!,I AM A DISNEY FANATIC AND LOVE TO WATCH AND COLLECT THIS MOVIES.BUT I MUST ADMIT I WAS DISAPPOINTED WITH SWORD IN THE STONE!!I FOUND THE STORY BORING AND THE ANIMATION IS POOR IN COMPARISON TO THE PRINCE OF EGYPT OR THE QUEST OF CAMELOT!! I FEEL ASLEEP THROUGH THE MOVIE!
4,captivating and entertaining,"Before animation started getting really slick, Disney movies such as this were made with good drawing and interesting characters. The story is of course the story of King Arthur, but the focus is on his childhood and training under Merlin.There are two great scenes in this movie, one is the young king being turned into a fish and spending some time in the moat were he almost gets eaten by a bigger fish and the second is one of my favorite in animation; Merlin fighting the witch in a battle of changing creatures.They change into dragons and goats, turtles and rhinos and it is a kick to watch imagination of the animators unfold. I remember thinking as a kid how clever it was when Merlin finally won by becoming a germ and infecting the Dragon witch.As far as Disney classics goes, this is up in the top and is a strong recommendation."
4,"Not a Movie that a lot of people remember, which is fun.","My kids love this movie. It's great to watch it again, because I haven't seen it in 30 years or so. The animation isn't as clean as the later movies, but that's what makes it more fun for adults."
2,Bootlegged Version,"I am extremely disappointed that the copy I purchased was listed as ""New"" and showed up as a shrink wrapped bootleg copy of Sword in the stone. How can I hold the seller responsible for this?"
3,The most climactic part was left out of this version,"I was so happy to be able to show this movie to my kids, since it was one of my favorites as a kid. I was disappointed that the final battle scene was cut out and it simply ended with Merlin coming back from Bermuda and Arthur was king. Boo! I want the full version! I kept thinking that there was something wrong with the computer or that the movie just wouldn't finish, but then realized that it just isn't the full version that I remember. That sucks."
5,The Sword and the Stone,We are in the process of updating our Disney movie collection from VHS to DVD since we no longer have a VCR.
4,Oldie but a Goodie,"I remember watching this 35 years ago. The battle scene between Merlin and Madame Mim is priceless. However, the age and old technology are showing- especially if you have a modern, big tv. This is NOT The Once and Future King nor is it any sort of faithful representation of the legend of King Arthur, but in a day where kids are exposed to Sponge Bob and gyrating Disney kids, I'll take it. Kids need to have a connection to culture, tradition, and history. I am glad that the classics- even a distorted version like this- are still available in a kid friendly movie."
5,Classic story given the Disney twist,"Combines magic and knights with music to be delightfully entertaining. The lightness and almost no stress is great when compared with the opposite today in most movies, including animation."
5,Excellent!,"In perfect condition! Was as good as when I was a kid! A movie even my son loved, and hopefully my future grandchildren will love."
5,ONE OF THE BEST GREAT CLASSICS!!!!,"THE SWORD IN THE STONE is one of the best great classics from DISNEY...I've seem this magic story many times and it's an ALL TIME favorite, like THE LADY AND THE TRAMP and THE FOX AND THE HOUND!!!! BRAVO, DISNEY!!! Many great memories from many great movies!!!!"
3,They were on the radio in Atlanta today!,Give their newest CD a listen (Fifth of July - 2005). They have gotten so much better over the past decade.
5,I'd had forgotten how great this series was until I listened to these CD's.,"I bought these for my son, who was not familiar with the hitchhiker series (which I read when I was in college - what has happened to our educational system? ;-) ).The BBC radio series was the best, with excellent voices and action. The awful movie made a few years back was a dreadful mistake.A little expensive, but well worth the purchase."
3,Part of a scene is missing from ep. 3.,"It's great to hear this series again - however for those who are fussy about these things, you should know that there's about a minute missing from the third part, at the point where the characters land on Magrathea. Originally the characters comment on their surroundings and it's explained that the Magratheans lived underground, while Marvin hums like Pink Floyd in the background. Marvin also plays a fragment of a Beatles song. I'm guessing that this section was removed because of copyright concerns."
5,Perfect match...,"For those who are Liebert's fan, to hear his amazing flameco guitar been so nicely complemented by Battisti's voice will be a tremendous gift... I dont know whose was the the idea to put together Liebert and Battisti, but I say, thank you very much Mr. Unknown, from the bottom of my heart... What a record!"
3,"One song, that's all...","The first song of the album, in fact, is beautiful, makes you move your body even though you are in mood... However, i can not say the same for the rest of the album. Overall, if you like Kate Bush, you may probably like it..."
2,More fantasy than martial arts,"I didn,t like this movie much because mainly the fight scenes were lame,no extreme choragraphy at all. this movie has a lot of no contact fighting that requires the viewer to presume contact when people fall down which is cheap fighting. The film could have been more if they would had less wire work and more on ground fighting."
5,superb,Every song on this album is excellent. I enjoyed this one more than the Bartok album. Wish this group would have recorded more together and in this style.
5,A longtime favorite,"Originally issued in 1983, this is one of the finest African albums ever recorded, and one of the first to draw me firmly into the orbit of Malian music. Pulsating, gentle, irresistibly hypnotic, it features the masterful, restless kora work of Jami Musa Jawara on four long, gorgeous songs, accompanied by a soulful, keening female chorus. This has to be heard to be appreciated, and once you hear it, you'll be a fan for life. The only downside is that you'll have a hard time finding other, similar albums of such high calibre (although the search will be fun!) Great stuff. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Music Guide)"
3,Fats Lives,"Nick Lowe's piano player does an effective turn as a latter-day Fats Domino. Watkins's voice sounds like Dr. John's, and it does wear thin after a while. But, the songs are great, and the arrangements top notch. ""It's Wonderful"" is a standout. If you've admired Watkins work on CDs by Nick Lowe, Dave Edmunds and other pub-rockers, you'll like this one."
3,soo long to wait,I haven't received this book until now.It's so long to keep me waiting for it. It has been late by a week for expected date.
5,This is a perfect comedy,"There is not much more to say about this film. You can watch it once for pure laughs. Once again to appreciate its various geniuses doing some of their best work on (and behind) screen. Once again to revel in its brilliant structure. Then again simply to laugh your way through it once more. Katie Johnson steals the show and this is especially remarkable because she steals it from some of the greatest comedic actors in history including Peter Sellers, Alec Guiness and Herbert Lom.Enjoy!"
5,Last of the brilliant Ealing comedies,"One of the best (and last) of the Ealing comedies, it stars Alec Guinness as Professor Marcus, leader of a gang of thieves who use an unsuspecting dotty old lady (Katie Johnson) as part of their scheme in a robbery. It's her house that they use to mastermind the robbery, and though she may be oblivious to the real world around her, Johnson is certainly mistress of her domain and unwittingly brings the criminals down. The ""gang"" poses as a string quintet and when by accident Johnson discovers the robbery money in a cello case, they decide to bump her off. Fat chance: they end up disposing of each other. The movie is hilarious and dark at the same time, and Johnson is just terrific as Mrs. Wilberforce. Definitely worth a watch."
2,Classic comedy but major shortcoming in the Blu ray release,There are no English subtitles. This is really a disgrace. Those that think English speakers do not need them should have their heads looked at. There are millions of people who are hard of hearing and hundreds of millions to whom English is a second language who NEED subtitles to follow the dialogue. To spend money and add Norwegian subtitles (when most Norwegians speak better English than most of those who use it as a main language) and NOT provide English subtitles is just disgraceful. A great comedy but to go to all this trouble and expense and then deny enjoyment to tens of millions of semi English speaking viewers is commercially stupid!
5,Must have,I saw this movie on a tv station that plays old movies and while i was watching it I looked it up on Amazon and ordered it. The movie was that good. Heard no vulgar language and was extremely suspenseful and at the same time humorous and entertaining.
5,A Classic,"One of the funniest comedies ever made. The word droll was invented to describe this picture. A flawless cast (Guinness, Herbert Lom, Peter Sellars etc) plays it straight and deadpan...and the find-of-all-finds is Katie Johnson as the old lady (who I believe was not a professional actress prior to this). As the brilliant criminal mastermind, The Professor (Guinness), and his band of inept henchman become undone by ""Mrs. Lopsided"" the irony and amusement build to a perfect ending. They used to be able to do this stuff in 97 minutes! It's a gem, don't miss it! Glad I bought a tape from Amazon while they were still producing them. Hope they will do so again or put it on DVD. It is a great, classic comedy."
4,Recent Tom Hanks Remake Similar In Form,"If you've already seen the more recent Tom Hanks version, then the story may be less interesting (and even a bit frustrating) for you as it follows a similar, but not exact, storyline. The music is fittingly dramatic and dastardly. The techinicolor creates an effective ambiance, and it is fun to watch Alec Guiness as the wily and cunning leader of this band of robbers. The little old lady character was quite perfect."
5,great video,"liked this old english comedy, as I am a peter sellers fans this is a good farcical comedy."
3,squirrel call,"the squirrel call that I orded is alright, it dosen't exactly sound like a squirrel, I rate this a 3 star, although deleivery time was great and price was not to bad. thanks."
5,Amazing,I was recently in New York and at LIFE I heard a version of this song ...It's amazing...Don't get me wrong I'm not an Olivia Newton John's fun and more of a drum'n'bass-house-hip-hop-big-beats-goa-trance-progressive-up-beat fun (???) but that's a really good song... Enjoy it...Joo (Portugal)
5,Wonderful!,"They were great! I got the exact product I wanted and it was quick, reliable and in perfect condition! I would buy from them again anytime."
5,Love this shower head!,"We love this shower head. We actually purchased 2 Kohler single function shower heads, one for each bathroom.This one is very elegant looking and we like the looks better and it was cheaper than the other one. But they both work great. We took a reviewers advice and removed the wire mesh so we could get maxium spray. The spray is wonderful. Gets your whole body warm and now I am able to wash my thick hair in the shower verses the kitchen sink. The only bad thing is it feels soooo good, I don't want to get out."
5,"Don't use don't, lol",I recommend this book often! I'm actually buying a second copy because I just like it so much. It's an easy fast read! As a mother of young children I'm glad I read this book early. Just by changing my language with don't is worth it. I'm still working on my language everyday. Well worth it!
5,Brine Phantom Ball,"This is the ball that all the highschool soccer teams in my area use for practices/games and it's very nice. It's a really good weight- not too heavy, not too light. These things also last just about forever, and even once they wear down they still have a nice feel to them. Great ball at a great price."
3,soccer ball,"was thrown the first day, we used in a hard floor not the grace, it may perform better on the grace."
3,Poor base response - not worth the money,"I purchased these at Best Buy for about $40 and assumed I was getting a decent quality pair of headphones - I wasn't expecting high-end sound quality. What I have is a pair of full size headphone that sound worse than the earbuds that came with my MP3 player. The base response is very poor which makes, say, a piano concerto sound tinkly. Not only that but it sounds like the high end is distorted and instead of CD quality it sounds like an FM radio.I even tried them on my comuputer speaker's headphone jack and still found the results disappointing. I'm not an audiophile but I could readily tell that these headphones aren't very good.I don't recommend them."
1,This was poorly made,This item is sold as a folding/travelling head set. This garbage breaks within a week. I ended up getting an old headset from the 1960's and swaping out the speakers. Don't waste your money on this item.
2,Lacks musicality,"This isn't necessarily a bad album, but it's not a good album.I didn't find impressive the performances of the more well-known pieces. But it was worth getting because it contains some less-commonly recorded versions of the ""Ave Maria."""
5,Weis & Hickman do it again,"This book was as cptavating as the last the new characters are detailed perfectly and so is the scenery, i would highly recommend this book to any one"
2,"very cliche , boring, and confusing",i read the first 3 books or atleast tryed and i have to say that these books are the MOST boring books in the world. it takes so many ideas from lotr and its very confusing and hard to follow. i read the first thinking it was going to be good which it kinda was so i bought the whole series(big waste of money sence they just sit on my self collecting dust). the reason its confusings is it just moves from finding the disk and trying to dicifer them but never explaind anything about them after book 1. its so boring because it just gos on and on about with no real plot point so save ur money and buy something worthe whileif u have any comments about this u can contact me at (...)
1,Night of the BORING Dragons,"The book looked interesting since it has elves and etc. The beginning of the book was horrible. The middle of the book got a LITTLE interesting. If you like Lord of The Rings you'll think this is such a copy (which it is). The end was terrible as well. I do NOT suggest this book to anyone. To me, this book was just something to kill time with. It was not very interesting! The book was a extremely copy of Lord of The Rings. It even has a character that is half-elf and half-human.Just like Aragorn! In the book, it has a group of warriors, and they call themselves the ""companions"". Just like The Fellowship in Lord of The Rings. I suggest people to read The Lord of The Rings before THIS! !"
2,late,"Hello,Not happy: I paid for expedited service, but the book arrived too late. However, another item ordered at the same time (a phone) did arrive on time, also with expedited service."
2,Mediocre,Nothing to write home about - in any of the movies. Sadly disappointed. Save your money and buy the classics.
4,Great CD,It's a great Ramones cover album...it's nice to hear great ramones songs (and there are a lot of lesser known ones on here) with some good production behind it and the Huntingtons do it the best. I would give a five but they don't put enough of their own spin on any of the songs.
1,drivel,"the ramones are great. i love them. this sounds just like the ramones... only without edge, character, and style. they tried way too hard to sound like the ramones. id much rather listen to the actual ramones versions.don't waste your time or money. maybe someday these guys will learn to sound like themselves and cash in on their own songs.there is a newer tribute CD if you must listen to a tribute which i would recommend-- 'we're a happy family'. the songs were covered in the style of the band covering them."
5,Not Christmas without the Chipmunk Christmas,"This is an awsome CD. I am 21 years old and have been listening to the Chipmunks since before I was walking. Even now at 21 years old, every year in late November after Thanksgiving and I put up my Chirstmas tree, the Chipmunk Christmas is always playing. It's not Christmas without some Chipmunk Christmas music.I know that some reviews were saying that their copies of Christmas with the Chipmunks Vol 2 has different songs on theirs. With my CD, all the songs listed in the product description are the same as on mine. They are all great songs and helps get you into the Christmas spirit."
2,Elliston,The listing for this product was misleading.It lead one to believe they would receive more than one item while only one of each arrives.
5,The second cd is just mind-blowing,"I knew about this cd came out in germany a while back but it wasn't until yesterday that i found out it was being imported into the united states.After i saw that it came with the 2nd disc that the imported versions also had I had no choice but to get itI started to listen to the 1st cd in the car on the way home, and during some errands. It seemed ok, more pop rock then trance but at least it was a change of style for atb.When i got home i popped the 2nd cd into the computerAfter the 1st 2 tracks, i am mesmorized just by listening to this. No words can describe how relaxing this isIf you like soft chillout ambient music without vocals then i would suggest getting the trilogy cd just for the 2nd cd since its the price of one single cd"
2,ATB has failed,"The last good artist release from ATB is No Silence. While I like the musical composition here on Trilogy, the lyrical content and choice of vocalists is horrendous...totally ruins what could have been a decent album. Most of the time the vocals are pitchy, which just kills the experience. This is very sad coming from an artist that I used to have a lot of respect for in the early 2000's. I guess I'll stick with his remixes for now."
3,"Right, not as good as the past",aside from a few songs on this album most of the songs just fade into the backround and are not particularly interesting
4,"ATB's new sounds, and then some.","This is definitely a high-flyer for ATB. It reminds me very much of the Two Worlds album, with the first CD being mainly techno-y/pop songs and the second CD being a great ambient mix. I'm not much of a fan of Heather Nova, and there's something about the featured single, ""Renegade"" that doesn't sound right, but dedicated ATB fans will like the new sounds, especially if you can't find quite the same kind of ambient that only ATB has. I would say it's no Movin' Melodies, or Two Worlds for that matter, but it's definitely worth the money. I've loved and listened to ATB for 6 years and I'm impressed that he can come out with a refreshingly new two-disc set after being in the game this long."
2,Disappointing,"This collection is not a great effort. If you are expecting the ATB we have all come to know and love (like 9PM...TILL I COME) DO NOT buy this album. I couldn't find any trance here at all. The first CD (it is a double CD)is basically straight ahead ""pop"" music. There are a few good tracks, but nothing to get excited about). The female vocalist is lame, the guys are pretty good. The second CD is generic atmospheric music with waaaaaaaay too much piano. Overall not what I was expecting. I wouldn't buy this (I wish I hadn't)."
1,ATB - Trilogy ... totally rubbish,"I've been listening to ATB for a while now and this is by far his worst album yet. New album I thought? Cool, it'll be as good as the last couple (except Two Worlds, which wasn't so good).Compared to his earlier releases like No Silence this doesn't even compare. The first half of Trilogy CD1 is ""ok"" at best - listenable but only if you want to go to sleep. The second half of CD1 isn't even worth playing - same deal with CD2 although you'd only want to play that if you're already asleep.The whole thing is slow, dreamy & boring. Should've guessed by the name of the track called ""9am"" instead of ""9pm"" ..."
3,Not original recording.,"Re-recorded in stero. Well recorded... but not what I was looking for. Sam Cooke would be impressed with Dobie's version of ""What a Wonderfull World"" though."
1,Boring,"A serious snooze fest. Of course, if you are a huge Kim Newman fan, you'll be pleased; literally every other story in the book is one. If you must read this book, check it out from the library; at least that way you won't be wasting your money."
2,Just so-so,"This book was something of a let down. The stories were a little dry. I never got that nice chill that I get when I read a good spooky book. Most of the characters in the stories are Sherlock Holmes want-to-be's. But they try to hard, aren't that clever, and most of the spooks come out of the Scooby Doo stories.Don't spend the money, and if you do, buy it used."
3,it was good not outstanding,this was ok not outstanding but good i will kill time on long trips with the kids and when you need have me time
5,Cribb at last,I've waited for years for the Cribb series to appear. This is about half of the episodes made by Granada. Cribb is the ultimate down-to-earth policeman with the perfect assistant in Constable Thackery. I hope the next set doesn't take as long as the first one.
5,Marx Brothers At The Movies,"Still have original paperback version of this great book. Each chapter covers details and behind the scenes stories of each of the films the team made, from The Coconuts to Love Happy.Very well done, with a good mix of pictures. I'd recommend it highly."
1,Never received after months of waiting,"I ordered this and the outlet covers for my kitchen in mid April. In mid May I received a tracking number from the company but, when you check the USPS tracking service they still have not received the package for delivery. I have emailed the company numberous times with no response. I have tried calling but, their voice mail system is full and will not accept any more calls. Beware of this company!!!"
2,An excellent guitarist performing weak material,"Gil Parris can play, but this music is bland. Try Blue Thumb instead."
3,Not as nice in person!,"Ok the dog is cute, the quality for the cost of this item is "" Just ok"" tips over easily, and one of the eyes has a defect to it. This also was what I noticed on another dog from this company.( Quality controll seems to be lacking here) I keep comming back for more though!!Go figure!!. So far the Husky is the best.Followed by the Jack Russell, and Westie..."
4,Great dog,"The dog that arrived did not look exactly like this picture which is why I gave it 4 stars. It's a wonderful, realistic dog. This is not a cuddly soft stuffed animal. We purchased this for an older child and realism was more important to us then being cuddly. Very happy and would recommend to others."
5,A wonderful gift!,I was very pleasantly surprised at the quality and the size of this plush dog.It looks so realistic! My little girl just loves it!
5,From transmission systems to networking!,"Great book! I've been working in transmission systems and networking for more than seven years now, and I've never found a book which had both subjects together. If your are planning to give some classes or seminars, this book is a very good outline and in-depth info source."
5,An Enterntaining and Feisty Anthology,"AutoBioDiversity is an entertaining and feisty anthology of essays culled from the pages of ZYZZYVA in honor of the journal's twentieth anniversary. In his introduction (introductions are his forte), editor Howard Junker notes that he purposely avoided including ""the usual suspects"" (other than the celebrated Phil Levine) in ""keeping with my essential commitment: to mine the slush pile in order to give new voices a chance."" Junker should be proud of this anthology. He put these writers into print, some for the first time. These diverse voices tell us in their own words what it is to be them. And because of their eloquence, we do walk in their shoes for a short but exhilarating while. What a magnificent way to celebrate a twentieth anniversary. [The full version of this review first appeared in The Elegant Variation.]"
2,"it depends on the definition of ""heavy duty""","I ordered four of these light fixtures for my mid-century ranch house because I thought that the style was perfect for the era of the house. The description of the fixture as ""heavy duty"" is a bit misleading. Two of the fixtures arrived damaged- the walls of the cylinder are thin and they were crushed. One of the damaged lights also had a dent in its top edge. Given the quality, I am left thinking that I overpaid by about $20 per fixture. And for those of you with an eye for detail, the interior of the cylinder is black, not white as in the photo. In the end, I still really like the look of the fixtures, including the powder coat finish, I just expected better quality because of how the product was described!"
4,Progress Lighting provides a good product,Material arrived on time and in good condition. Product was exactly as described and was installed and works just as it should. Looks good too. Durable for outdoor use.
5,Plug it in and go!,"I bought this product so that I could connect my satellite receivers to the internet since I didn't have a phone line. I just took it out of the box, plugged it in, and it's worked ever since!! Super easy!"
1,Trendnet Ethernet adapter,"Product was shipped on time, works fine for connection to my TV. However, customer service for Trendnet is zero. The unit would not take the password supplied in the box and customer Trendnet service never responded to my inquiry. I just gave up."
5,Dish Network life saver,"Terrific! I bought this after I had been through 3 Dish Network Vip722 receivers with modems that had gone bad. I purchased ONE of the TRENDnet 85Mbps Powerline Adapters for three receivers. There is no need to buy one for each one of your receivers because the Powerline Home Plug compatibility is built into the receiver. So for all of you people that are tired of bad receiver modems or have no home phone, for less than $50.00 this is your answer."
2,"Gotta be on the same circuit breaker, else it's hosed...","The Trendnet manual does make a passing mention about this major issue:Like all powerline networking products, this requires that the access point (I purchased Trendnet's wireless powerline access point along with this product) be on the same cicruit breaker. Mine was not, so I get a dismal 1.05 mbps speed to the AP. Not catastrophic, but not good either.Think about this: you want an access point when your router's range is insufficient. Which means, you have a large area to cover. Whenever you have large areas to cover, it's rarely the case that the point farthest from your router, might happen to be on the same electrical breaker.In sum, powerline adapters are really not great at what their primary application is supposed to be: to help cover distant parts of you house/office/building...However, if you happen to have the two parts (router and the access point) on the same electrical breaker, then great, go for it!"
4,TRENDnet Powerline Fast Ethernet Adapter,"The product does exactly what it is designed to do and it does it very well. There is one weakness. Being that it cannot be connected thru an AC power line surge protector ... well, if there is a power line surge then poof ... the unit is quickly destroyed. This is especially true in Florida where lightening induced surges and prevalent during the summer months."
1,ripped off by techdepot,I ordered this product 64mb smartmedia. They sent me 32mb smartmedia. will never shop amazon again. The distributor was techdepot (an office depot co.). LATTER AMAZON!!!!
4,Darn good,"Tracy Bateman is having a really bad day. His farm is going to pot, his wife has left again, his dog is dying and although he won't admit it, he's on a fast track to alcoholism. And then his ex-best friend, Kevin calls and offers him a job. Tracy and Kevin have an intense love/hate relationship and it's mostly hate these days. Kevin is a charmer but he's also a liar, schemer and on occasion he smuggles drugs. Before you know it Tracy is right in the middle of a really bad situation and if he can't sober up long enough to fight his way out of it he and his wife could end up dead.Madison Smartt Bell has written a thriling book. The background descriptions of New York and Rome are fantastic and there isn't one wasted or cliched character in the whole story. I think this is one of the best of the Hard Case series."
1,I've enjoyed every Hard Case Crime book except this one,"I've read a lot of Hard Case Crime books. Some are vintage 1950s classics of the hard-boiled genre, while others are new published works from some of today's hottest authors. The classics are laced with subdued violence and implied sexuality, while some of the newer books are full of swearing, violence and sex. And, I've enjoyed all of them until now.STRAIGHT CUT by Madison Smartt Bell is a Hard Case Crime book that I just can recommend. It really is a long, meandering mess, and even as I read the final pages, I really didn't quite know for sure what was going on. Tracy seems to be in some sort of love triangle with his wife Lauren and best friend Kevin. As a film editor, he goes to Italy for a job where he gets tangled up in some kind of drug deal.The purpose of this review is simple. If you like Hard Case Crime books, then keep reading them. Just don't choose this one."
4,Another really good book by M S Bell.,"Great plot, really liked it (according to my notes from 1996). Not as good as ""ten indians"" or ""year of silence"" but still, quite spellbinding."
4,Wonderful,"This is a delightful tale of two pugs, the different paths their lives lead them, and how they end up together once again. It's a wonderful story that they really should republish."
3,cute and seewt,"altough i don,t own pugs. they are my fave breed of dog this book is so great. it is really really short but its still charming you really can picture the liiitle pugs running around. i defently think it should be repulblished it makes a good compaion piece too clara: the pug who ruled my life."
1,What the heck is this crap?,"If I wanted an entire dialogue from a movie played over a song I was listening to, I would turn the TV on! Bryan Erickson is a dork. The best moods are created when everything is done in a subtle way and the ability isnt being milked for all it's worth with some goth moron squeezing the udder in your face. Even Bill Leeb would think this is crap!"
2,Fun with Cheese,"I believe Velvet Acid Christ has to be one of the worst sampling bands I have ever heard in my life (I doubt I will ever get over the ""Engage"" song, with all those start trek samples) and they don't let down here, as always you will find the most common movie samples from the biggest movies you can think of.I will admit the music has grown some, it is better than any of the previous cds. As a DJ I do play ""Fun with Drugs"" and every now and then if its early enough I play ""Decypher"".As a music fan I would recommend skipping this CD, as a DJ I would say buy the CD if you have some extra spending money as ""Fun with Drugs"" does good on the dance floor and does get requested from time to time."
4,A good industrial album that's definetly worth a listen,"I'm not really a deticated fan of VAC, but from what I've heard so far, Fun With Knives is probably their best album. The beats range from slow-paced and trance-like to fast and violent throughout, and the many samples mixed in with the songs provide extra visualization to the dark theme of the album. Fans of bands like :wumpscut:, Nine Inch Nails, and even Funker Vogt will find at least something about Fun With Knives to appreciate. The only real drawback is that the last couple of tracks seem less inspired than the rest."
3,Buhhhhhhhhh.... It's OK.,"Standard Front Line Assembly-ish dance fodder from Bryan Ericson aka Disease Factory. There are a few standout tracks such as The Dark Inside Me, Icon, Fun With Knives and Slut, but for the most part it floats by without making much of an impression. Recommended if you like: Funker Vogt, Front Line Assembly, X Marks The Pedwalk"
3,Techno-industrial for teenagers...,"Of course, Fun With Knives is not bad (an album with a real razor blade inside cannot be bad...). Lots of dirty synth melodies and perverted dancy beats as we like it... But I couldn't find such creepy evil distorted dancefloor-killers like ""bsat2"" or ""the dead"" on Calling Ov The Dead. Everything seems a bit too well-known or too disco-like for my taste. And the best tracks were already contained on the single CD, Fun w/ Drugs... So... Sorry dudes, maybe next time."
4,Jo is a tom boy,"I was'nt really into burst angel but this was good, monica rial did a nice job voice acting jo but this was good."
5,goog soul artist,i chose this after reading that bobby wrote songas that the rolling stones did and i like all his music
2,It's OK,"I feel bad giving it two stars. It is a good book as a primer introducing one to the subject of divine healing and it does have a few enlightening points. However, I just expected more, that is, more depth into the subject."
4,NOT a kid's show,"I'll be honest, I didn't really read much about this show ahead-of-time. I read the general synopsis and went ahead and bought it because it sounded interesting. Most animes are suggestive and have sexy anime characters, but they're usually clothed. Lots of full-on nudity in this show, so don't buy this for kids.The plot is pretty good, kind of predictable and silly, but I really enjoyed it. The drawing was decent although the blotching at the beginning was disconcerting, and the characters as a whole have enough personality to make the show enjoyable. The guy who does the voice for the main character is probably my least favorite because he comes off as entirely too dramatic, but the other characters' voices make up for it. If you like a light-hearted, fun anime where one wave of a sword blows people's clothes off this one is worth watching."
4,If you like fan Service well here ya go,"This Anime is full of fun, You get some of Bloddy Violance, Alot of Nudity and ""Adult situations"" AKA Fan Service.That being said you can realy follow the story even though there is a lot of Sexual Situations, The action keeps you watching.If your a Samurai Anime fan you should pick this up it is fun and enjoyable to watch and it is one you can watch over and over again.This is also not your typical Samurai anime I wont spoil anything but you will not be disapointed.Due to Violance, Blood, Cursing and ""Nudity"" this is not for children. This is what I thought of a almost tasteless anime but you gotta watch it for your self..."
5,A classic revisioned....,"The characters and plot are classic Anime with a harem of beauties and warring ninja clans - but the artwork and presentation was innovative and fresh with echoes of Hokusai. Classic Japanese images and landscapes are married with Bladerunner like futurism. Not quite as dark as Oshii's Ghost in a Shell, but certainly worth the investment. I would count this among my top three faves: Black Lagoon, Ghost in the shell, and Samurai Girls."
4,For the True Sports Fan,My son is a huge Patriots fan. We got him these pencils and he loved them. They looked exactly like they did in the picture. What more can you say about pencils?
4,"Not the best Mapfumo album, but ...","... that's like saying: ""Not the best Brandenburg concerto.""If you don't own any Thomas Mapfumo albums, select another one for your first (you can't go wrong with ""Chimurenga Forever: The Best Of..."").If you DO already own one or more of his albums, all you need to know is that this album is almost as good as the others."
1,This is not (the) Johnny Mathis!!,"BEWARE!!! Amazon, this is not Johnny Mathis! This is an imitator so how is it that his photograph is on one of Johnny's supposed to be ligitimate items for sale?"
5,Whast is Christmas without the Chipmunks?!,Took it to my church Christmas dinner and young and old got a kick out of it! Worth every penny.
2,SLOW! Do not purchase!,"Bought this because I needed a reader for my large 8GB and 32GB CF cards for my Canon 5d Mark II. This reader is crazy slow - it takes about half an hour to transfer 1 gb.DO NOT BUY unless you have unyielding patience. For my needs, while traveling I need a reader that I can quickly upload to my laptop without losing a lot of battery power. With this reader, a full 32 GB card would take over 10 hours! Be sure to buy something that is USB 2.0!"
1,So Slooooooow,"I am a photo student and I only wanted a simple card reader to take raw images from a compact flash card into my computer. My school has a lexar card reader so I thought this would be good as well, but this seemed to be not the case.At first, all seemed well. I inserted the card and the folder came up instantly. I then tried to copy less than 100 raw files into my computer, which is actually less than usual. Usually, it takes about a minute or so, never more than 5. However, it says that it will take 45 minutes! Right at this moment I am STILL uploading the files, and I have 25 minutes to go.If it is meant to take raw files from a CF card, then it is way to slow and completely inefficient. After I am done uploading the files, eventually, I will return it and buy a better card reader."
4,A fun mystery,"Fans of Ellis Peters's Inspector George Felse mystery series (the series she wrote before her more famous Brother Cadfael mysteries) will be very pleased with this book. Instead of George Felse, the hero of this story is George's son Dominic, who fans of the series have watched growing from a precocious adolescent to a teenager, and now to a very intelligent young man. On a trip with friends from university, Dominic stumbles accross a death which, although it was ruled an accident, may not have been so accidental after all. Not a little captivated by Tossa, the charming step-daughter of the dead man, he begins to investigate. The result is a clever, engaging mystery/suspense tale that will charm fans of the traditional British mystery."
4,swingin',"ok, so it's kitsch and synthetic. Now that's been said for the umpteenth time can everybody just shut up and listen? ""Luxury"" refers to the bright and shiny, the disposable, the plastic, and the delights therein. It pops and crackles, but can just as easily bloom into something more substantial: the last track, Mr Fantasy's Love, begins as a squelchy, ticky-tack synth novelty, but by its end has transformed into an acapella string quartet that meshes the quaint with the heartfelt. The disco cover of Eurythmics' ""There Must Be An Angel"" is fabulously ethereal, and ""Lotto"" grabs you by your wide lapels and gives you a good shakedown. Fun music, and more conventionally melodic (and probably longer lasting) than much of Pizzicato Five."
3,"Don't Be Fooled By ""Theme of Luxury""","Because this is an obscure album in an obscure genre, most listeners are probably attracted to this album after hearing ""Theme of Luxury,"" which was featured in a recent car commercial. ""Theme"" is a 3-minute acid-jazz masterpiece, one-half Vince Guaraldi on speed (frantic but melodic piano, deep but swinging percussion) and one-half latter day Copeland. The rest of the album, however, is so different that it might as well be a different artist. Think of hip-hop/dance music that samples '50s lounge albums. ""He Became a Beatnik"" and ""You Must Learn All Night Long"" contain some funky Moby-does-jazz elements, and make this disc an interesting (even enjoyable) listen, but don't be fooled by ""Theme of Luxury."""
4,"Good stuff, Maynard.","Not as good as the self-titled ""Fantastic Plastic Machine"" album, but good nonetheless. The second track (...Angel...), is hypnotic; worth buying the CD for, in my opinion. If you like Towa Tei and smooth beats, you'll probably like this one."
4,A very energetic and engaging effort.,"Having never actually heard much of their first cd, I really had no idea what they would sound like. What I quickly discoverd was that the music on the disc was all very uplifting and pleasing to the ear. As some may call it, ""ear candy,"" I found it to be a good, solid effort from start to finish. In a time where so many bands sound the same, it's certainly refreshing to listen to music that is unique. If music is supposed to get you emotionally involved, purchase this cd."
2,Spare Me - What a Bore,"Snore. Yeah, it's chock full of ear-candy. And sure it's affectionately done. I listened a couple of times and was compelled by none of it. Perhaps it's the conspicuous lack of tension. Or maybe it's just an impeccably crafted ode to the most disposable which fails to transcend its source material. In any event, this ain't 5-star quality work."
2,Not what I thought.....,"This Luxury disc really fails to excite me. When I heard the first track ""Theme of Luxury"", I got excited and thought I was in for a real treat. Now that one(Track 1) I can play over and over. Then the second track, ""There must be an angel"" had promise, it was cool... However, after that... The bottom fell out! Aside from Bossa for Jackie, which mysteriously sounds like a track from his previous CD. The rest of them are mediocre at best. It seems as if he concentrated just on making a multitude of tracks besides focusing on quality. Even for fans of the genre, I'd have to say pass on this one, unless you are collecting. It's nothing you haven't heard before or nothing that is a must hear."
1,Like Hell!,"Just because you said umpteenth in attempting to dismiss my comments, I'm cutting my award of stars in half. One star! So there.You did absolutely nothing to convince me that this merits anything more than a cautionary post."
4,Kid heros.,"If you like crime movies with kid protagonists (The Window, The Hostage, The Client, Playing Dangerous, Home Alone) this one is about average compared to those. After his cop-father is framed and imprisoned, a boy and his two buds find a cell phone by a hotel swimming pool, and it's owner gets murdered before they can return it. They know there's an important message but have to crack the password to find out what it's about. In the mean time shady characters are calling the phone and trying to get it, gradually getting closer.It's not as serious or suspenseful as The Window or The Client, but more appropriate for children; yet not as funny as Home Alone - and not meant to be. It's well made with good acting and a story that holds together, resulting in a suspense film for the whole family."
5,The Bible for Edison Phonograph Collectors,"This is really an excellent compilation, with photos, of every model cylinder phonograph that Edison produced from 1877-1929. There is a detailed history, year by year, model by model, and even accessories are included. It is truly the best book on the subject. If you have any questions on restoration of these machines, the best resource is by Eric Reiss, ""The Compleat Talking Machine Book"", but if you are looking for an in-depth survey of the electric and spring-wind machines and inventors, this is the book. If you have any questions about your phonograph, talking doll, coin-operated examples, etc., just email allenamet@aol.com. And for identifying every wax cylinder, there is ""Edison Cylinder Records, 1889-1912."""
5,Fabulous after thirty years,"I read this the first time when it was first published in the 1970's, but, after re-reading it, I really didn't get the message. I got it this time. If I were to list the five best books I've read, this would be near the top of that list."
5,Review of Music for Chameleons by Truman Capote,"I had a faded copy of Capote's, Music for Chameleon's years ago and enjoyed it thoroughly, as I am enjoying re-reading the stories. They are honest, slightly humorous, deep, and just enjoyable to read."
4,Handcarved Coffins is the only one worth reading,"Capote had pretty much destroyed himself by the time this volume was first published, still Handcarved Coffins is an extremely powerful piece of writing and worth getting."
3,add me to the group,"I use to review CDs and Fossil was just one in a long-running batch of Warner's freebies (much appreciated, by the way). I've gone through piles of crap over the years and every once in awhile one of these toss-offs, that the record company doesn't believe in, really, but puts out -- or put out -- anyway, drills down into the head. I really have always liked the song ""Moon"" and it resides on a favored mix tape. I'm pausing from a massive cleanup of ye old bachelor pad and there, under a dust bunny clump, was my Fossil CD. I blew off the coating, polished and can't wait to put it back in rotation. Fossil is starting to live up to its name and I have done the excavation. Strange world. . . . Hey, for a penny, give it a shot."
4,Worth Digging Up,"Near as I can tell, outside of a couple of EPs that featured some of the same material, this eponymous 1995 release was it for Fossil. That's unfortunate, because they showed real smart-pop, alternative promise, and lead vocalist Bob O'Gureck had a heck of a voice and range. These are tightly crafted little numbers ready-made for humming, with just the right balance of production gloss and garage sensibility, lush harmonies and melodic sweep. Another sad resident of the ""Shame It's Out-of-Print"" File. ""My fiancée carries a gun""...Love it."
3,This is for Japanese,"If you buy it at Amazon.co.jp , you need 50000yen.But if you buy it at Amazon.com , you need 3200yen. (in 2011/Oct.)50000yen : 3200yen ... Which is profitable?[[[Notes]]] This animation uses multi languages for example Chinese and English etc.But this BD hasn't Japanese subtitle or stand-in of it.If you wanna understand all story , you have to display English sub , and you need translates it by yourself.Maybe you need English as same as a junior high school level."
2,mm....,"I didn't use it as much. It didn't help tremendously but it does have the process of resolving some of the study problems. I don't regret having bought it though because I feel like anything helps with this course. However, don't expect a whole lot of information on how to solve problems beyond the strategies (which aren't that great) already given by the companion text book."
4,Gift,Gave as a Christmas gift to my neices who are 3 and 2 years of age. They loved singing happy birthday.
3,Love Melissa and Doug toys,"This is the cutest birthday present, kids can celebrate their birthday all year. Two wishes for this company...that their toys weren't priced so high and that they still made them in the US. I now look at the tag and if I'm lucky enough for it to be made in the US I buy it, if not I pass."
5,Happy Birthday!,"This toy is great for 3 and 4 year olds who love to play birthday party. My 2 daughters love to set up parties all over our house. When I got this cake for my daughter, we 'celebrated' everyone's birthday. This toy definitely allows the child to use their imagination."
2,Very Disappointed,"I bought this toy for my daughter's 5th birthday. By the end of the day, red paint had chipped off the cake platter and the velcro was pulling away from the sides of the cake slices. I thought my daughter and her 6-year-old sister would have a lot more fun with this toy. They love playing pretend house and store with their plastic foods, and they love having parties with their stuffed animals. They haven't played with this since the birthday. Also, I was disappointed that the wood tray didn't come with some sort of lid, even a plastic one. This toy was a bummer."
4,Great toy but paint chips easily.,"My kids love it. They use it all the time. I eat cake practically all day, if you know I mean. It is a great toy and can be educational to teach fractions and counting. Bad thing is that it is dropped often so the paint chips easily and the wood bends. If you don't mind having less than perfect looking toys I think that this toy is worth it."
5,An instant success!,"I got this for my 2 and 1/2 year old daughter because she was singing happy birthday to everything, and making pretend cakes. This toy was an instant success. She loves decorating the cake differently, blowing out the candles, serving the cake, and watching everyone 'eat and enjoy' her creations! She had a little trouble cutting the pieces when it was new (the velcro was too sticky), but now that the velcro has been used a little, it is easier to cut, and she still has a ball playing with it. I would highly recommend this toy!"
5,Love Velco Melissa and Doug Products!,"Who would have thought that you could velco things together, and let kids get the ""real"" experience of making sandwiches, cutting vegetables, or in this case decorating and then dividing up a birthday cake with candles and toppings. Of course, Melissa and Doug. I'm a huge fan of their products anyway. We already have the vegetables/fruits. That went over huge with all our kids. Similarly, the birthday cake has been a hit with toddlers and little kids alike. Would definitely buy more of the velcro/cutting toys. Great for a gift too!"
4,About what I expected and my son enjoys it,"I was torn about ordering this toy. But it's arrived and my two year old has had lots of fun with it already (and is currently playing with it in my lap). I like that it has a tray to store and carry everything. One of the candles arrived with the flame detached already (a simple fix with glue). Some of the the decorations were showing wear within a half hour of gentle play. It's not super noticeable and isn't detracting from my son's enjoyment.Overall, this is about what I've come to expect from an inexpensive wooden toy. I could have spent more and got an heirloom quality toy, but he'll enjoy this one for a couple of years and it will probably be around for several more years after that though it will look a little worse for wear by then.I don't usually get Melissa and Doug toys because I like to support small crafters or make his toys myself. But this fit the current need just fine and was within my budget."
4,"S,. Ortega",Great toy. Kept my cousin busy for hours. Very durable and even comes with it's own storage box. Kids can be creative with several types of designs which are all included. I would highly recommend this.
4,M & D Make your own Birthday Party Cake,My 3-yr. old grandson had fun decorating the wooden cake with wooden jelly beans and serving the cake pieces with play ice cream. Toy is of limited educational value--except that it helps develop fine motor skills and engages some creativity.
4,Fun with food,"Most of Melissa & Doug toys are durable wooden toys but this set is not as durable as the others. We have had this toy for about three or four months and the red wooden serving platter has a number of marks on it. The other pieces are holding up much better. My girls still have tons of fun, but it is something to consider when buying this item."
3,Where's the Cover?,"Great Toy. Great Puzzle. Great Developmental Value. Great Construction.WITHOUT ANY TYPE OF COVER!!!!!!Melissa & Doug constructed a great wooden and Velcro toy. It will give any child hours of fun while nurturing skills they need for their proper development. What is the purpose though, for constructing a toy so solidly of wood and yet provide no cover to hold the pieces in place!? I don't know.I rated this product with only three stars overall AND for its durability because a toy/puzzle with pieces just begging to be lost should be seriously pondered before purchasing."
5,Wonderful gift!,"I bought the Birthday Party Birthday Cake for my three year old niece. My sister said that she plays with it for hours every day and that she throws parties for her stuffed animals, their cat and her little brother. Based on her reaction, I would definitely recommend this product."
4,Birthday Pary Cake Toy,"My 4 year old loves this toy. She has shown more interest in this toy than in most of her other toys. My only fear is the paint since it was made in China. I suspect it has been painted with leaded paint, but I don't know for sure, so I just make sure she doesn't put any of the pieces in her mouth. Everything about it is cute and pretty. She loves bringing me pieces of cake several times a day. I would give it 100% rating if I felt comfortable about the paint."
3,Um.. 50/50 here....,"I like Melissa and Doug products. I bought THIS as my son's birthday is coming and he loved this at the library. It didn't seem to carry over at home. THERE IS NO PLASTIC LID. All the pieces fall out ALL the time. It's cute, but let your kids play with it at someone else's house.. and save your money on a better M&D; product. Even if it had a lid, it would be better!!Novelty wore after after about 10 minutes. Oh well. In the cupboard it goes.( I took this to church with me, for the preschool class. NOT ONE CHILD PLAYED WITH IT OR SHOWED ANY INTEREST. )"
4,Sturdy,"I got this for my son on my daughter's birthday so he would have a present also. He likes serving birthday cake. Paint is on well and I have no problems with it, although I wish it had a cover for storage."
5,"Happy, Happy, Happy!","I am a fan of all the Melissa and Doug products, so I just had to purchase this for my toddlers. It's a great addition to their play kitchen, and they love to use their imagination to ""bake"" us a birthday cake. They even sing for us! The product is very durable, and packs away nicely. If you have any pets that shed, the velcro on each piece of the birthday cake may double as a magnet. We have a bit of dog hair on ours. Nonetheless, we've been very delighted with this product, and it continues to make our kids happy, happy, happy."
2,Made in China,"I was a huge fan of Melissa and Doug products. I went in to buy this set at a local toy store and was saddened to see the Made in China label- in fact all the products that were in that particular store by Melissa and Doug were made in China. What bothered me about that fact was that they market themselves as USA made and that clearly isn't the fact anymore.I chose not to buy it anymore- particularly with the amount of red paint on this toy food product. Now they do say they test and test and safety test.But as a parent, I chose to not buy it anymore because of my concerns about product safety from China.Sad to say I will no longer be buying Melissa and Doug- the stuff is adorable I just can't be guaranteed of it's safety anymore."
5,Birthday fun!,"We bought this for our daughter's 3rd birthday. She absolutely loved it, and has since received several other Melissa & Doug food sets (slice and decorate cookies, decorate cupcakes, pizza party). She has tons of plastic food (which she also loves to play with), but these wooden sets are much better quality and provide more realistic play. It's been almost 2 years since she's received this and it's just as much fun now. She has birthday parties for her baby dolls all the time."
4,Grandchildren love it!,My grandchildren helped to select the Birthday Party Cake and enjoy playing with it at my house. Just wish it had a lid to keep all the parts in.
5,My preschoolers love this!,"I bought this for my Sunday School class, 3 years old through Kindergarden. They all absolutely love the Melissa and Doug toys. It really helps them use their imaginations, and the toys are very durable."
5,Melissa & Doug Birthday Party Birthday Cake,I got this set and the Ice Cream Parlor Set set for my 4 yr old niece for her birthday. Her Mom said she loves them and has a lot of fun playing with them. I thought they were adorable and couldn't decide which one to get so I got both.
5,luv it,My 4 and 2.5 year-old girls love this toy. They have lots of fun pretending to bake the cake and serve it to their friends.
5,"Indeed, a classic","Those who enjoy Steeleye Span, Albion Band, the New St. George, and their ilk will love this album. The performers are something of an English folk all-star band, many of whom have performed with Albion and Steeleye. The tunes are traditional, the arrangements electric, but respectfully so, and sometimes electrifying even after 25 years."
3,Not very good,"..Being an avid Morris Dancer, I perchased this CD to go home and have a few practises of Morris Dancing. To my disappointment, it is apparant that no morris dancers were present at the time of recording as the musicians were just playing the tunes as if a K-tel ""20 Morris Hits"" sort of combilation CD, which was typical in the early 70's when this recording was made. However some tracks sounded live as if there was a morris dancer/morris dancing teams present which I practised to, this giving me a 3 star rating for this CD. Apart from this, this is a very good colection of Morris tunes which has not been matched so far to the present day. If B'Witched from Ireland can come up with some good Irish jigs then surely Eliza Carthy can dish something - Girl Power Morrissy - and carry Morris dancing into the new millineum !!!"
2,More Richard Thompson PLEASE,"A boring, unremarkable set of songs from the quintessential English folk artist of the late sixties and early seventies. Richard Thompson, who recently was voted # 19 best guitarist in a Rolling Stone poll, is virtually a non-factor. His guitar is barely audible, which is a major mistake, making the music dull and unrewarding. Don't get me wrong there are some moments in here but they are far and few between."
3,Persistent Disparity,This book does a good job at adressing the widening gap among various groups across the country. It is good for anyone concerned with people and inequality in the world. It allows you to step out of your current world and see the bigger picture. The research and statics seem very thorough. The biggest criticism that I have is the lack of inclusion of all minorities. The focus seems to be black and white issues leaving out all others. It does have some information on male female inequalities which are good.
5,Payment Deferred - Forester's first published novel,Payment deferred is a superbly written crime novel. The main charachter is well developed and the dark plot leads to the excellent final twist. Truely a milestone in crime fiction this book was unfortunatly overshadowed by Agatha Christie's 'Murder of Roger Ackroyd ' published the same year. In my opinion this book is second only to ' The general ' as forester's best work and shows that Hornblower is only a small part of the man's literary achievments.
4,"A concise morality tale, well-told","Compact story that provides insight into the guilty mind. A man beset by debt makes a decision that puts enough capital in his way to make a killing on the market. But his new wealth is useless as he battles to keep the world from finding out his original crime.Well-paced and written with a pleasant sense of economy, this book is well worth a look (it's one I've re-read several times now). The movie made from the book (starring Charles Laughton) is also worth watching"
1,Makes Damage Worse,"This product will not fix your disc, I tried to fix a damaged CD and it only made the problem worse. I ended up throwing away the CD and the SkipDoctor. This is a poorly designed and manufactured product that does not work, I wish someone would have told me this before I spent money on it."
5,It works but it's not a miracle-worker,"We have used our disk doctor for about three years now and are very pleased with the results. We have salvaged more than 5 Playstation games that got abused by my teenage son (who leaves them lying around the room, out of their cases). I figure that I'm $150 ahead of the game, despite the cost of the resurfacing wheels.Remember that it works by removing a single layer of plastic (and the scratches in that layer) on the disk. If your scratches are deeper, you may have to use it a couple of times. If your scratches penetrate to the layer where the data are stored, then you are out of luck and need to buy a new CD/DVD/game.But for about 80% of the problem disks out there, it really works great!"
2,"When it worked, it worked fairly decently","It doesn't make discs worse. And it doesn't fix every possible scratch. Some people here think it'll fix severely damaged discs. It is intended only for reasonable damage.However, I spent $49 for the motorized version at Best Buy. It worked and I'd give it about 9 out of 10 rating scale on fixing the library's badly scratched discs. But a year later (maybe less!), it appears as if the internal gears are stripped. Apparently the gears inside are plastic and don't last long. Unfort., there's not much choice on CD scratch repair machines to choose from. I am forced to have to buy the manual version now, or go back to what I was using before - a drill-powered buffing wheel and car finish buffing compound."
3,Don't dispair skip Doctor is here,I have used it several times now..Yes it leaves marks on your disk but don't let it get you down..They put a buffing cloth with the kit and remember to use lots of the liquid thats with it..Take your time and the cd will play like new..Remember to buff well...Of course it wont fix your cd's if the scratches are in the label portion..
1,WHAT A DISSAPOINTMENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,The worst part is that I totally ruined a one-of a-kind DVD! This product should be discontinued. It does more harm than good. I have not being able to fix one single CD or DVD. In fact the product has just added more scratches and made my cd's worse. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. Get a new DVD or CD. It will be less expensive!
1,Complete Waste of $!!!,"Before the CD doctor treatment, my CD's skipped once every two seconds. After a few resolutions, they skip once every ten. No improvement. I am returning this crappy product and getting my money back."
1,Useless,"The SkipDoctor ruined any discs i used it on, despite my reading every word in the manual and following any bit of advice i could get from reviews on this site."
2,It's barely worth watching...unless you're a Britney fan,"There's nothing really special about this film. I'm surprised it made it to movie theaters instead of just being a made for tv VH1 or MTV movie which is what it should have been. Its not entirely Britney's fault though. I think if she had a better script and if they used better actors, I think their acting abilities would rub off on her and help her become a better actress. Instead they used two other girls that we don't care about and that can't act and made the movie even more ickier. Still...there are WORSE movies out there which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of only one. I'm not anti-britney because I love some of her music, but this is definitely just a video rental (if you like Britney) and not worth buying."
1,IF U HAVE TROUBLE SLEEPING WATCH THIS MOVIE,THIS MOVIE IS A WASTE OF MONEY TIME AND THE ACTOR BRITNEY SPEARS [word] OF COURSE ALL OF BRITNEY SPEARS PRODUCTS ARE A WASTE OF MONEY BECAUSE A MONKEY HAS MORE TALTENT THAN HER
3,Actually decent,"I rented this DVD simply for the Spears-in-panties-singing-Madonna opening scene, however I decided I might just watch the whole damn thing. Surprise! Spears can act! However, the movie is very predictable. It has constant cliches, and the script is pathetic. However, Spears does a pretty good job playing a smart girl. That's a damn big stretch. The most cheesy thing in the whole movie is in the first 10 minutes, when any normal girl would have taken her clothes off and gotten ""banged"" (edited for Amazon version), she gets all moral and says she doesn't want to do it... kudos to her mother, he succeeded. Also, the fact that Jamie-Lynn plays the young Lucy is greeeat."
1,This movie made me CRY more then A walk to remember...,"god it was soOo LONG, it took 1 hour+ of my time. ... I went to see if britney could out act mandy... um that didn't happen, what happen was she made herself look like a joke to mandy' acting skills. I wasn't a fan of either britney or mandy but after AWTR i really like mandy... anywayz back to the movie... the reason it made money was because of britney' fans and the other half was made of non-britney lovers and people who just wanted to see if she can act. I only gave this movie 1 star because that was the lowest, if only there was a no stars rate."
1,movie with no plot,"This movie was horribly edited and directed. There is no plot and Ms. Spears attempts to steal the movie with her ""acting""....this movie clearly displays that she sadly lacks that talent. The other actors are far better then Spears, which is a shame. The lead should have gone to someone with at least a little talent. Do not go to see this movie, unless your objective is to cringe and walk out about 20 minutes after the film starts..."
4,She s a Lucky. She s a Star,"I know I know. A lot of people don't like this movie. And in some way I do understand them. Of course it isn't a masterpiece, it won't become all-time classics, it won't get any Oscar (but who really knows, maybe. . . but it is completely different story), it isn't intelligent art-house picture.YES. But what do U want? It is just different.It is cute, funny, sometimes really touching story about 3girls&1boy_ridingincaracrosstheUSA. Well. It will be more correct to say that this movie is about character of Britney. She is the center of this story. And this movie is worth to be watched only because of her performance which is really beautiful.This film is that one which will be understood only by appropriate audience: teenagers who like such kind of stories AND of course fans of BRITNEY. Somebody like me...."
1,Horrible!,"This is one of the WORST movies I've EVER seen! Horrible story, horrible plot, horrible music, horrible acting!! Don't rent this movie, or buy it. If you want to see GOOD drama movies with AMAZING singers in movies, I recommend Jewel's movie ""Ride with the Devil"" and Mandy Moore's movie ""A Walk to Remember"" instead of this waste of money."
2,not appropriate for kids,"I took my young daughter to see this movie and was so disappointed. The numerous adult themes in this movie was inappropriate for my daughter and what was expected to turn out to be a mother-daughter bonding did not materialize. This movie was horrible and strongly encourage parents to read a careful synopsis of the movie before going. This movie raises issue like rape, alcoholism, etc. that is inappropriate for young children."
1,My friends and I went to see crossroads,"The acting was horrible, the singing was horrible, we just thought this movie was too long boring alot of the time, and we all agreed that glitter was better than this, a whole lot better."
1,Yuck!!,"My friend told me she rented ""Crossroads"" for out slumber party. I said ""Yay! I love that movie!"" which I DO, the thing is I thought that she meant the movie called Crossroads with Ralph Macchio in it. I was in for quite a surprise when Britney's eerie grinning face popped up on the screen. At any rate, I did watch the movie and to put it bluntly, it sucked like a vacuum cleaner. It was bad, it made my IQ drop five points, you shouldn't run away screaming if someone tries to make you watch it."
1,WHAT MORE DO I HAVE TO SAY?,"I'm so glad that people have enough sense to see how [bad] this is.Britney Spears can't sing so what made her think that she can act! This movie is a joke.Bad acting.Corny,predictible,laughable script.Bad direction.Bad singing.Bad everything.But what do you expect this is Britney Spears!! And as we all know anything involving Britney Spears is surely going to tacky,corny,dumb,and forgettable.Great campy movie next to ""Glitter""."
2,2.5 Stars :Not the Best But Not The Worst,"Britney Spears is not the best actress ever but she's not the worst compared to Mariah Carey in Glitter.The actors on this film aren't that bad,it's just that the movie SUCKS!!!!!Whoever wrote the story must have been lazy enough to realize that no one likes these kinds of movies anymore!!!Me being a straight fan and her numba 1 fan wanted to try this movie out.But I wasn't at all impressed.And I'll be honest since I'm a true fan unlike all these fake fans that say this movie is great,it SUCKS @$$!!!!!!!!!!!!!I gave this 2.5 stars ONLY because the actors weren't that bad.Britney Spears should star in a horror flick just like Paris Hilton(House of Wax) and Destiny's Childs Kelly Rowland (Freddy vs. Jason)did.Yeah maybe a horror movie would do because let's be real people,DRAMA just ain't for Ms.Britney Spears."
2,Always the mmmm....ahhh........she's never unsexy.....,"I don't care for this movie...it wasn't garbage......my g/f asked me to watch it...it WAS cute...okay...Why cant Britney ever cover up her derier, or belly? Always trying to look like she's ready for SEX.I wish that the first scene of her bedroom, her underwear had major streakmarks on it....sick of her always making herself look so...mmm....ahhh....more.......who cares if shes trying to market herself......cant she ""market"" her smile,? She is pretty! Do i need to see her in tight clothes all the time? Boy, Britney.....unconfident...you need to show that to be noticed? Sellout."
1,A word of warning for parents,"This movie has quite a few problems, not the least of which is confusion over what's it's core audience will be. the movie deals with very adult issues (including sex and underage drinking), but because Britney Spear's main audience is preteens or people not much older this movie should be handled with caution.Next the british press has already reviewed the film and there reviews are iffy at best. Everything from the plot to the aforementioned star's acting ability have been attacked, for that matter it is also difficult to find any review with something positive about the film."
1,Do yourself a favor..........,"and buy the 1986 film with the same title. Not only is it a better story, it's full of excellent music, and has better musicians in it (Steve Vai)"
1,Yuck,"Since she can't act, I hoped shed at least look hot. Boy, was I wrong. What a waste of time and money."
3,Crossroads,"I thought Britney Spears did ok for a singer suddenly turned actress. Most parts of the movie I think she over dramatizes what she's saying. She sings in the movie... mostly lip sync. That would be ok if she could move her mouth to the same words that are playing on the tape. I did, however, like the plot and how everything turned out. It was a bit different from all of your other ""teen movies"". Overall, if you're bored one night and want to see a movie with your girlfriends, Crossroads is a good pick."
1,It made me nervous,"I should have known when the guy at the ticket counter said, ""Are you sure you want to do this?"" to my friends and me that we were in over our heads. It was the only movie in town and so we went for a laugh.I have only walked out of one other movie, ""Armageddon"" but managed to stick with this one, maybe because it was only about 70 minutes long. It is like one huge commercial!! No, seriously. Pepsi, Wet Seal and Brit's record company all got together and tried to think of the best way to exploit Britney and her movie. Whoa, it was weird. Oh well, she is hot, but the movie is utterly embarassing to intelligent humans.I have a feeling the only kids who will enjoy this are the ones who saw ""Pearl Harbor"" 65 times!!!! BEN AFFLECK IS SOOOOOOOOOO HOT!!! OMIGOD OMIGOD. scary."
2,Would have been a great movie BUT ...,Come on you have to be kidding right britney b-movie girl a actress PLEASE! The only place that girl belongs is on a dog food commerical. The story line was great everyone else in the movie was great I liked it even tho my sister drag me to it. But the only thing in it I did not like was britney she totally killed the mood of the movie. I gave it 2 stars one for the guy the other for the story. And i'd give it one more if you never put britney in another movie!
3,Britney CAN ACT,"This movie wasn't my favorite. It was one of the movies that really didn't have a distinct story. Personally I can feel for her character Lucy and what she's going through but not a lot of people will be able to. It's a fun girls night out film and that's all. Britney can act, but her girl co-stars cannot. Watch it if you have nothing else to do."
1,Britney Spears a Role Model?? I don't think so!,"Britney Spears is a role model to so many childern. Yet in her movie ""Crossroads"" Britney supports driking, date-rape, permarital sex, out-right disobedience, etc. If I had childern I would not let my childern go watch this movie. This movie supports the falling morals of our nation. I think we need to encourage our childern to go to clean,family movies. If we let our childern keep watching movies with hated, drinking, and sex our youth will not get better, but worse."
2,A Bland movie that will not entertain you..but will bore you,"It really was not that good, but I was really looking forward to it!! And when I saw it, all I could do is try to like it...and as you can see, it didn't help much. But Anson Mount and Tamra Davis's performance was great, true actors and actresses, but Britney Spears!! ... Her crying scene was hideous, looked like a 4 year old trying to cry. What a [dumb] storyline too...."
1,Find a better movie to watch!,"There are good movies out there. There is absolutely no reason for you to partake of this piece of trash, marketed to the Americans that the entertainment industry is in the process of rendering imbecilic. Find a better movie than this to watch! Given the quality of this one, that's about the simplest request I could make."
2,~Nice storyline- actors not so good~,"I'm not a Britney hater so hear me out :-)The storyline was cute but the actors were so clumsy and fake with their lines in certain scenes-especially Spears. The girl can dance that's for sure but acting is better left to the professionals.The DVD extras contained nothing but ""Britney Spears-THE SINGER"" type of extras.It was just not what a good movie should be. Yes I admit I watched it the whole way through because it held my attention to a point but this is not what it could have been."
1,Slow and boring,"I rented this video out of curiosity and I wish I didn't. It was a total waste of money. It was boring and slow paced that I couldn't finish watching, I was falling asleep. Britney Spears did a horrible job acting, she was very phony. It is so typical that she would end up dancing and singing (which she cant do either) in the movie (ALA glitter). Don't waste your time and money on this piece of garbage. It is not worth it, I think I lost a few brain cells watching it."
1,This movie could never score 4 stars,"It is more than clear that Britney cannot act, she shouls stay with music (already losing popularity). This movie also has no plot and it is only a propaganda for her new cd"
3,Absolutely Awesome!,"Even though i am a Britney fan and it makes me kind of biased, i have to say that i loved CROSSROADS! It was a great debut film for Britney and i can't wait to see what she has in stores for us next!"
3,great movie with so so acting,"I Went To See This In Theaters Not Knowing What To Expect From...Britney Spears Acting In A Movie. I Hate Britney But Admit It's A Good Movie If You're A Teen With Problems. This Movie Bases Itself On Real Life Problems Including Teen Preganancy , And Rape. This Movie Is Dramatized But Very Good. It Teaches Teens What Not To Do."
2,A Twinkie and Starburst Review,"First, we would just like to say that yes we did watch the movie, and we're not just slamming Britney. Okay, let's all face it though, she can't act. And although she preaches high morals, she can't seem to keep her clothes on! (Practice what you preach, even if you're acting, or you're still setting a bad example!)"
1,Mom's beware!,"This is not a movie for your 10-13 year old unless you are ready to talk to her about sex, premaritial, teenage sex, that is, drugs, drinking, rape, teenage pregnancy, running away from home, dressing sexy to get what you want.... It was a huge disappointment. I know Brittany wants to break away from the younger fans but what she is doing instead is misguiding those younger fans terribly while not gaining any respect with the older scene."
1,Dissapointed,Was very dissapointed with this DVD. It arrived in the package scratched. The DVD was not in it's holder.
4,Go Britney!,"I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie. I wasn't sure if the story would be any good, but it was. Britney isn't that bad of an actress too. Everyone else was pretty good in this film as well. I mostly enjoyed how the story line went. It's about a girl's path to finding her dreams (a singing career of course) and building a stronger friendship with her two friends despite all of their differences. Through all the issues these girls face, they stay strong and become independent and smarter people. The only thing I would've changed about this movie is how Lucy (Britney Spears)had to lose her virginity in this movie. In all it was a truly deep and inspirational film."

1,this movie was a complete waist of time,"this movie was so stupid. why is it getting such high rattings. it suckes.it's about 3 girls who unite as friends by going to CA. thrilling huh not really.the characters were very poor as well.britney spears(lucy)tyran manning(mimi,i cant stand her.she is so ugly)and the okay one was zoe saldana(kit).this movie was so depressing that i really threw it away.do not recommend"
1,It's so bad it's good,"You've gotta love Britney Spears, but this movie was pretty terrible. I had to see this movie on a red-eye flight because I couldn't sleep and I needed something to distract me. I probably would have had more fun staring at the back of the seat in front of me. The plot was very stupid and the acting was pretty horrible. However, it was such a bad movie, that it was actually kind of entertaining. Someone had to work really hard to make it this bad, and I think this person deserves some major credit"
1,Good Try,"I won't write a review in which I tear apart Britney Spears, but I have to admit that this was not the best movie in the world. Sometimes Britney came off very convincing and other times it seemed as though she was trying way too hard, especially in the dramatic scenes.Some of the things that occured seemed a little unrealistic and only happened because it was a Britney Spears movie (i.e. the bar scene). I think that Britney should have left her singing and skin-bearing persona at the door and really tried to delve into the character of Lucy. We hear Britney on the radio all the time, we don't need to hear her singing in a movie as well.Fans of Britney Spears will love this movie because there's plenty of her performing and being sweet and innocent. Others, however, will probably want to skip this film."
1,Don't waste your money,"It's Britney Spears acting, what can I say? Basically, this movie serves as a vehicle for Spears to take her clothes off. I mean, the first glance we get of her, she's lip-synching in her bra and underwear. Where did Daddy's good little girl, as she supposedly is in the film, get the sexy pink lingerie she proudly models when she has sex for the first time with her nerdy boyfriend?All in all, if your a Britney fan, you'll definetly like this as it consist of her jumping around in no clothes and warbling like a duck as she usually does."
1,one of the worst movies i have ever seen,"this movie is BAD!!!!!!!!!! because it is unrealsitic and britney cannot act maddona is a better actress than she is. This movie is not apporiate for her younger fans at all because it deals with sex, miscarriage, and drinking. Also it is such a take off of the movie boys on the side. I laughed though the whole movie and the part i laughed sooo hard at was her poem . I'm sure britney fans will enjoy it but if you Hate Britney like i do i would'nt recommend it at all but if you want to make fun of her than i would suggest seeing it."
5,Crossing a great line,"Britney Spears stars in this excellent film debut. I love her because she has a feel good feeling and so does this film. I can't beleive why so many people slagged this film off. Any way it starts with Lucy-a teenage nerd who is a school boffin, she meetes up with her ex-best friends and they decide to go on a road trip together. Britney wanting to see her mum for the first time, Kit wanting to see her boyfriend and Mimi wanting a record deal. So without any money and a broken car, Lucy and her friends are stuck, so who can sing? Lucy and she does, winning loads of cash and getting the money to pay for the car, she carrys her jorney on, Learning her mom don't want her, Kit's boyfriend has cheated on her and MiMi can't sing.So that's the main storyline the rest of the film iS up to you to see.It's one of the best film I've seen and I can tell you It will be yours"
1,EW!,"Crossroads is quite possibly the most pathetic movie I've ever seen. I am only reviewing this in an attempt to bring the average number of stars down. I don't know how anyone can like this movie! I mean Britney Spears's inability to stay in character throughout the whole movie was really obvious and annoying. I don't know how anyone can think that this movie teaches morals. I mean, it's not at all realistic that a girl can go off and get in a car with a strange man without being taken advantage of or killed. And that whole premaritial sex thing...But it isn't only the immorality of the movie, but the annoyingly predictable plot that made it so awful. It was the stupidest movie I've ever seen.Oh, and that part when Britney reads her insightful poetry and it's her song lyrics was so stupid that I couldn't help but laughing out loud."
2,worse than nothing,"This movie was a waste of time, energy, and money. It should never have been released. Britney may have played a silly young receptionist on a recent tv episode and appeared to do well but that is also a back to back comparison of insane britney and a step back up for her. I'm glad she's doing better, but let's face it, the girl can't sing worth a damn and she certainly could not act her way out of a paper bag when Crossroads was made. She might do better now in an insipid role like the ""Mother"" episode. I bought Crossroads from an amazon seller several years ago for 1 cent plus shipping, and it was a waste of the 1 cent and certainly of the shipping. I tried to give it away but nobody would take it so I finally tossed it in the trash."
4,Britney Spers in Crossroads,"I REALLY liked Britney Spears in Crossroads because her character, Lucy was really cool and smart.It was a good movie! I am 11 and a really big Britney Spears fan! But it was a great movie and i cant wait until it comes out on video!Some parts were really slow moving, but other wise it was terrific!"
5,Britney Can Act.,"Britney Spears has done it again with her new album 'Britney' which includes the fist single from the soundtrack 'Crossroads' 'I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman.' Britney plays a girl named ""Lucy' who is a goody-goody. She obeys her father, played by Dan Ackroyd. She and her friends decide that since they are graduated and moving on with their lives, they need to have one more trip together. Britney or 'Lucy' wants to find her mother again. This film has some new-commers and some who have played in the film 'Center Stage.' 'Crossroads' is directed by a talented director, Tamra Davis, who has directed films with Adam Sandler and Bridgette Wilson. She has proved that she doesn't care what kind of reviews this film gets. Britney makes a difference and proves a pop singer can act. 'Crossroads' looks like a good film. Go see it! It comes out February 15, 2002!"
3,Average teen movie- Good reminder to have a sleep-over,"It's hard to really rate this movie. Compared to teen movies, it is quite good. Actually, it was better then i expected, but it wasn't great. It's a good movie to watch at a sleep-over. Enough said."
4,A ALL AROUND GOOD MOVIE,"""CROSSROADS"", featuring mega pop star, Britney Spears was actually a good movie. Altough many people were saying she couldn't act, she actually showed that she could. Now shes not the worlds greatest, but they all start out that way. She also gets help from her fellow costars. The movie itself is an all around good film,that many girls can relate to. It's fun, and anybody can watch it. Now, if all you males out there aren't for that kind of stuff, you still have Britney Spears, too watch and drewl over, and 2 other good looking chicks.So check it out."
3,My kind of movie.,"....But don't let this bother you, the film is sweet and nice. When Brit appears in her underwear and starts to sing Madonna's song you start to laugh...Then the storie goes. It's a tipical teen movie, about girl friends that just forget that they are friends, but a strange thing lead them to the same way, and music keep them together.They pass by some problems solve them, though.Whoever tells you the film is bad, don't believe, 'cause it's pure prejudice. The cast did well. Brit fails some times, but she's fine. Maybe people are just afraid since somebody said that the film was bad. There are some nice scenes and scenes that you can sing with.If I were you I would wacth it but it's better if you do this on the afternoon, because this movie wouldn't fit in your night schedule."
4,Awesome!,Came super fast in the mail! The wrapper was falling off the DVD case but nothing was wrong with the case or DVD!! :)
5,"NEW, HOT, FUNNY, & A GOTTA SEE DVD!!!","crossroads the movie is one of the best dvd's around!!! on the dvd it contains more than 3 hours of new & exciting footage!!! like britney spears music videos, 7 never seen before sences, ""the making"", and so much more!! you just have to buy it!! it's the perfect movie. it has laughing, crying, fighting, fliting, romance, singing, dancing, fasion, heartbreaks, and so much more! (in this movie anyway) i'm telling you it's a gotta see dvd!!! ... i rate it 5+ stars!!!!!!!! wow!! ..."
1,not a good movie...,"This movie, is well...not good at all. I think Britney is okay and all, but she should have not agreed to do this movie. She's not a bad actress, but this movie is SOO typical. Imagine all the typical movie concepts, (prom night, road trips, a shy girl liking a ""rebel"" dude), and you get Crossroads. I do not recommend this movie..."
5,"It's good people, get over it!","Britney may be a pop star, but this movie has nothing to do with her music career. So what if some of her songs are in it...get over it. This movie is about real teen issues, that change people, that people that are teens go through and people that have been teens have maybe gone through. This is not another teen movie, it has meaning. Britney is a great actress, she's won awards for her performance. So PEOPLE, stop being sore thumbs & see the movie. It's good, it's got a great cast, a great plot...The DVD is 5 hours long, it rocks. Case closed."
1,An Attrocity of Gargantuan Proportions,"We all know that singers(yes I use that word lightly here) should not make movies. After seeing Glitter with Mariah Carey I was positve that there could not be a worse movie made. I was wrong. Dead wrong. Crossroads stands for everything that is wrong with our country and this world. All I could wish for the entire movie was a Thelma and Louise ending of driving off the cliff in a convertible. This wish first occurred during the opening credits. I was even willing to sacrifice myself and drive the car off for them because then my children and future grandchildren would never have to hear Britney Spear's squeaky voice that sounds more like an Amazon Red headed parrot in heat than a millionaire pop star. Please people, do not buy this movie. The only reason to buy it would be to collect every copy and burn them all in hopes that Crossroads could be erased from our memories and DVD players forever."
3,MST3K Fans Rejoice -- Rifftrax is Here!,"Among the finest Britney Spears movies ever made, Crossroads* tells the story of a high school graduate who drives to L.A. Not very exciting on paper, but up on the big screen, it's a drive-to-L.A.-stravaganza! Fueled by today's exciting pop hits, Crossroads is sure to connect with the new ""youth"" market we've been hearing so much about lately. Featuring knock-out performances by Dan Aykroyd (My Girl 2) and Kim Cattrall (Turk 182!) and featuring the chart busting hits of newcomers Mystikal and *Nsync (prounounced NUHS-ink), Crossroads is Federline-free fun for the whole family. Oh, and it makes for a hilarious RiffTrax.*Not the Crossroads where the Karate Kid (Ralph Macchio) challenges Satan (The Author of All Lies) to a blues guitar contest."
3,Not as bad as I thought it would be,"I rented this movie one night with some friends expecting to get a good laugh (a la Glitter). I was surprised to see this movie was much better than I had expected. Britney Spears is the weakest amongst the actors, but she does an adequate job playing the cliched character of beautiful yet brainy Lucy. Taryn Manning and Zoe Zaldana are actually highlights of the film playing Kit (the beautiful engaged friend) and Mimi (the white trash pregnant friend) respectively. It was too bad the movie couldn't focus more on those 2 as opposed to Lucy and her roamnce with Ben. The movie also would have been much better if there weren't so many ""excuses"" to feature Britney Spears singing in the movie."
2,cheese anyone?,"I went to go see this movie because, to be completely honest, I was curious. After Justin Timberlake's HORRIFYING stab at acting, I had wondered if Britney would follow suit.Her preformance wasn't as Vomit-inducing as Justin's, and I give her credit because this was probably her first real stab at acting. BUT MY GOD. THAT STORY LINE!!! I got out of the theatre with I thought: ""I just paid [money] to see a 2hr after-school special. what a rip. oh well, at least Anson Mount is a hottie.""Given that this is Britney's first major role in a movie and that I wasn't expecting much to begin with (b/c of precedence set by Justin), I decided to cut her some slack. Not everyone is an actor, but with a little work (and a better story line, preferrably one she doesn't come up with) I think that Britney can become decent actor.Britney Spears get two stars for her valiant (yet VERY cheesy) movie acting debut, and one star for Anson because of above mentioned reason."
1,it is always smart to focus on what you do best,"Britney is a great singer. I only hope she'd keep to her singing, and not dabble into something that can only detract from her brilliant career.This movie is a waste of precious time. The story is a flop, and the acting is way too predictable. If you don't have better things to do with both your time and money, or if you are a die-hard fan of Britney's, you may not mind this tripe called a movie. For the rest of us however, we'll have to look elsewhere."
4,Crossroads,"In my opinion I think it was a good movie. Espically for young girls and girls tht are only living with one of their parents. But, it was sad that her mom didn't want to see her and totally forgot about her, and a the mom had a new family ,was married and everything. There was one part where I think was wrong because Britney had a boyfriend and he wanted to take her virginty and she didn't want to so her boyfriend had broke up with her."
1,Not Since Glitter has there been something so horrible.,"If you are the 1% of movie watchers that liked Glitter, this is a sure bet. Another horrible movie from the year the diva's made their acting starts. If you think Britney Spears is hot, watch it. If you expect a good movie, with a good story line, and good acting, skip it."
4,Good Effort for First Movie,"This movie wasn't as good as I thought it was going to be, but it also wasn't as bad as a lot of people say it is. Britney does a good job acting. She is an actress. Trust me, I have seen bad actors and Brit is not one of them. The movie was slow at times and I wish it would have explored Lucy's relationship/meeting with her mother more (Britney plays Lucy). There were a lot of opportunities for Brit to be in her underwear (more than necessary) and for her to sing. However, I did want to hear her sing. I think the writer and director have to be held accountable for the problems in this film. I did not like the in your face product placement. Lucy and her friends are from Georgia where Coca Cola rules, yet they are drinking Pepsi products and Lucy washes her hair with Herbal Essences--one of Brit's sponsors. All in all, I think it was a good movie and shows that Britney has a future on the big screen."
1,GAG!,"There's a reason why aspirins exist.After seeing this (I had nothing better to do), I reached for a bottle of Tylenol.I thought that this movie was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I've never liked Britney Spears, and I never will, and seeing this movie made it even worse! She can't act at all, and the story line lacked...well, everything. Personally, she needs to stick to something she's good at, and it's definitely not acting and singing."
1,"Lousy dialog, bad acting.","I don't blame the actors for the bad acting...they didn't have a good script to work with. This movie looked sort of cute and it started off sort of cute, but ended up being a dud. It was about the worst movie I saw this year...it's a close runner with Vanilla Sky."
3,Much better than I thought,"I'm not a pop music fan, and not a Britney fan, so I'm surprised at how much I liked this movie. Most of the acting was cheesy, the plot was cheesier, but still, I liked it. I thought Britney performed well, which shouldn't be surprising because I think much of her pop star persona is an act anyway. But despite what I think of her in real life, she was so cute in this movie! The story is very predictable and the ""real issues"" nothing new, but still entertaining. I hated the audition scene though, she's so clearly lip synching! It's a movie for goodness sake, you can do a retake if you mess up! Would have also liked some more substance to the scene with her mother. But all in all, it's a good rent if you're female and you find teen movies a guilty pleasure!"
4,I fairly enjoyed it,"First of all, I want to say that I'm not a Britney Spears fan, but she did surprised me with this movie.This is her debut movie, and she appeared very natural and convincing in her role. She tested out her dramatic skills with good results.I was surprised also 'cause the movie touched certain topics like teen pregnancy, rape, fidelity, and at first I thought the movies was going to be all about the music.There were parts that were just simply for fun, but were handled really good, like the car-ride sing-along.On the other hand, the only part that wasn't convincing was her confrontation with her mother, 'cause we didn't got to see it, and I think that scene could have shown Britney's potential as a dramatic actress.Overall, to my surprise, a good movie"
4,Britney and Crossroads,This is really a good movie. Well I only saw for Britney Spears! I love her! But I got into this movie so much. I mean I'm only 11 years old but hey the movie is woth it. It only has a little bit of curing and a small little love seen. But all it shows is them taking off their shirts. Then thats it! I started crying in this movie! You laugh and you cry. I know I'm gonna buy it the day it comes out.
1,Poo = Crossroads,"I saw two guys kissing once in the park, that was the gayest thing I had ever seen.....Until I saw CrossRoads."
3,It's actully good when you get past Britney,Ok all those people that hate Bristney Spears get over your selfs and if you want to see this movie watch it if not dont but dont judge it if you havent seen it. I actually enjoyed this film and would recomand it to people who like feel good movies adn espesailly for teenagers. The story is sweet and inocent a groip of friends on a cross country trip. I liked it becouse it shows life in early 2000. It will be fun watching it in 20 years and saying to your kids Britney Spears was the it thing and that's what people did. The acting was good you cant expent much from this movie. Overall you cant expect much but it's enjoyable.
2,Horrible!!!!!,I went to go see Crossroads the weekend it came out. I was coming in the movie with an open mind because I have heard good and bad things about this move. A bunch of my friends went to see it with me and we were all disappointed. Crossroads was such a boring movie!!! It is really short and doesn't have any plot. You can just watch the first 10 minutes of it and predict the rest of the movie. Most importantly their was no climax. Why waste time and money on a movie that has no twist??? This was one of the wrost movies I have seen in a long time.
3,It's ok,"Britney can act, but she was the only one in the movie that could. The storyline for this was a bit unrealistic and corny.But then if you like Britney you will enjoy it."
5,Fun Movie,"This is a movie that critics took WAY too seriously, it's a movie that is what it is, a fun movie that is easy to watch and is mindless fun. It's enjoyable, Britney is not as bad of an actress as people say, they only say it because it's Britney and people like to take any shot they can at her because she's rich, beautiful, and has it all. I'd recomend it if you're looking for a fun, light film. If you're looking for a serious drama, then this isn't for you."
3,actually 3 and a half..,this movie wasn't as bad as i thought it would be. Brittany spears isn't a bad actress and was actually comvincing at times. The storyline was good though. kit and mimi were awesome at their roles.. so.. not a bad movie.. who knows? maybe i'll even rent it again
3,"Not the best, not the worst","If you would buy this DVD for anything, buy it for all the extras the DVD comes with, like the commentary, music videos, karaoke, deleted scenes, editing the ""I'm Not a Girl"" music vides (cool), and the making of Crossroads.This movie was okay...predictable at times, but I was surprised that Britney Spears could act half as good as she did in this movie. There are times when you cringe at the cheesy scenes, but there are other times that you actually laugh or cry. So watch the movie and decide for yourself if you like the movie--because you either love it or you don't."
3,Cute Movie,I like this movie! I watched and fell in love with this movie when i first come out and every now and then i get a bug to rewatch it. Those girlie movies just suck you in and you just have to keep coming back to it!
1,WHAT?,"Why is this so expensive?! I don't think that this movie is worth $50.00 at all. Yes, This just crazy, why would anybod want to buy a two hour movie that is over $20. I am actually extremely disapointed."
2,unintentually humorous,"I would have given the book 1 star, except all the implausibilities & mistakes started making me laugh. The main characters are always making such idiotic choices that it's a wonder they're still alive. And not just because there's a killer on the loose.To name one thing out of many: what kind of FBI office doesn't have field people on call, even on Thanksgiving? The little museum is staffed that day, but FBI field agents can't be brought in?? And how does the Thanksgiving turkey get thawed instantly?I MUST add one quote: ""It's like finding a straw in a haystack,"" Cortez said tersely as he stared intently ahead. If you remove the seed head from hay, you get straw, so it's not difficult at all, is it?"
3,Before Sunrise,"Phoebe Keller's heart held a long buried passion for Jeremiah Cortez, and he for her. Yet, that did not stop him from breaking her heart, sending her into a diseasterous relationship and tearing them apart for years. When again they meet, she needs his protection. A recent archeological find has resulted in murder. Now Phoebe is in danger, and Cortez is her only hope to stay alive. Artifacts are not all that resurfaces. Crossing cultural lines and personal rules, these two reconnect on many levels. Yet, undercutting their romance is the threat of danger and the taboos they fear to break.*** Rather than her standard older hero, younger heroine romance, Ms. Palmer's protatgonists are of disimiliar backgrounds. Though she does break from her norm somewhat, her fans should still find it pleasant to read. ***Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer."
2,Not well researched!,"The romance of this was fairly well. But this writer usually has her hero worry about the age difference. She is early twenties. If he has been in the military at the end of the Vietnam war, he would probably be in his late 40's. Also, real FBI agents don't get lay people that involved in an ongoing case, and almost get them killed, for romance sake. And, if you are out in the snow for that long, in such flimsy attire, you won't instantly be interested in romance, and worry about going to a crime scene! And anyone who is being stalked by a killer, who goes out alone to prune roses, which do not bloom in winter anyway, is an absolute moron! I adore romance thrown in with a good police procedural, but only if it is believeable and well researched.As another reviewer said about a previous novel by this writer - please, Ms Palmer! Find a different formula. They break up, she gets hurt, he comes running - same old, same old."
4,"Same old style, but really entertaining book.","This book is the usual Diana Palmer writing. I thought that there was a lot of romance and action. It wasn't boring in any parts. In most all her books, I end up liking the secondary man better than the lead, (in this case it is Jeramiah vs. Drake), I found myself rooting for Phoebe to give Drake a chance, but no that didn't happen. I loved the talk about forensics and burial grounds, and lost treasures or artifacts. That was entertaining! Good mystery on the villian. This book had me guessing of at least 3 different people. Usually, you can guess right away, but not in this book. I think that Jeramiah's reasons for staying away from Phoebe all those years wasn't a very good one. A family tragedy, yes, but how he handled it, no. I would say that if you like Diana Palmer's writing. Then, you would like this book."
2,"Oh, Diana...","'Before Sunrise' was, sadly, quite a disappointment. I've read a lot of Diana Palmer's books and usually I love the formulaic tough, slightly misogynist man vs. younger, sometimes TSTL but gusty woman. This one, however, I had to force myself to finish. These two were made out of cardboard, no depth whatsoever. I think perhaps someone forgot to 'insert personality traits HERE'. Diana... time to fire your assistant cos s/he's doing a faff job and get yourself a good one..."
4,Excellent Read,"I really enjoyed this author. The mix of mystery, humor and romance are perfect. She writes in a style similar to Janet Evanovich, whom I also enjoy. I am looking forward to reading more by Palmer."
2,Seems to have been sitting around ...,"Waiting to be published since the mid 1990s. The problem is that this book starts in 1994, and finishes up 3 years later (in 1997). Which could explain the discrepancy between the male lead's stated age and the age he should be if this was set in 2005. Anyway, the issues I have with this book is much like those put forth by other readers: it's dated, formulaic, and just ridiculous in parts. A timepass read, but look into JD Robb, Patricia Cornwell, or Kathy Reichs for a ""police procedural with romance"", not Diana Palmer."
3,So-So,"Cortez was fine, goodlooking, smart, and all that, and Phoebe was great, although I don't understand why D.P. likes such an age difference between her characters (it's believable in past centuries because it was so common, but not sure about present day).I was starting to get annoyed with these two kissing passionately, then stopping, over and over again.The actual story wasn't bad. I live in NC and find Native American history fascinating.But like many of D.P.'s books, (which I've complained about before), the dialogue is so formal, it doesn't seem at all how someone would talk."
5,Even a beginner can do it.,Great information with step by step instructions. Sue makes it so easy to understand the different types of paints available on the market and which brands are the easiest to work with. The instruction is detailed and even a beginner can do it. I'm looking forward to making more of my own hand painted fabrics!!
2,Surprised by the positive reviews,"This book covers all the basic fabric painting techniques, but the resulting fabrics are muddy looking and uninspired. I'm glad I borrowed this from the library instead of buying it. There are many better book choices."
3,Easy to use but...............,"This product was easy enough to use with pictues being easily transported over to the program however there are not many embellishments or backgrounds. You can download more from the website provided by the manufacter for $5.00 or more. You can upload pictures and albums to the Memory Mixer site if you do not have the capacity at home to print out your pages. There is not a full range of designs either. My son plays baseball and there is not one baseball design in here, (but a few for basketball and soccer). All in all, easy to use but I wish it would have come with more pages and designs."
5,Classical Polka!,"The brave lads from Denton, Texas are at it again with anothertip-top collection of exhilarating musical journeys, this timeconcentrating on the western classical ouvre. Most of the 14familiar themes are done up polka-style, but there's also disco, pedal-to-the-metal rock, and other styles sprinkled into the mix.The piece-de-resistance of this CD is the ""William Tell Overture"", rendered in a incredibly joyful and grandChicago-style polka arrangement, with irresistable chugging accordian and, as always, fantastic horn work from Jeffrey Barnes and Danny O'Brien. I saw Brave Combo perform in Chicago just last Saturday and this was the last tune they played - it could be their set-closer for many years to come. Long live Brave Combo and polka music!"
1,Don't waste your time unless you want to copy photos from the 1980's,"As a professional photographer, I have come to love and adore many of the products released by Amhearst Media that pertain to my line of work. This book is by far the biggest disappointment I have made in the purchasing of published materials in the last 6-7 years. The photos being presented for examples with which to draw inspiration feel and appear as though they are about 30 years in the past. I applaud the book for its safe use of babies as models. There aren't any ideas in the book that would cause a fauxtog to endanger a child by doing something stupid in the name of copy-catting the work a professional spent hours accomplishing in photoshop. This book is severely outdated, save your money and buy a book on lighting or a new tripod."
4,My first,"The first RT album I heard and purchased. I was impressed enough to go back and pick up everything that came before...and have continued to buy everything that has come since. Way underrated by critics...including RT himself, whose feelings about the album is understandably colored by his experiences. Worth many repeated listenings.(Aside: If you're ever looking for cheap humor read the end of the year best-of lists over the past 20 years. Most critics have a pisspoor track record. Yes they are worse than you think.)"
4,Strong Comeback By Once Mighty Band,"'Creatures' marks the return to prominence of the legendary though somewhat faded band Xyxmox/Clan of Xymox. They started with the ""Clan of"" tag making very dark, very Goth music. They began combining more electronics and crafting more accessible music; at that time they dropped the long name and went with ""Xymox"". The first effort with the new name, 'Twist of Shadows', was masterful. Subsequent releases were not as the band basically sold out to pop, techno, or the flavor of the moment. They lost nearly all of their fans appropriately so.After a long hiatus, they re-emerged with the original name intact. More importantly, the original sound was back too. 'Creatures' is a very strong Goth effort hearkening back to their early days. Standouts include ""Jasmine and Rose"" and ""Consolation""."
4,Thank God its not another pop album!,"In the beginning, I thought this Xymox CD was a Sisters of Mercy CD--the vocals sounded SO similar. Compared to albums like ""Metamorphosis,"" this was a breath of fresh air. The cuts tend to be on the slow side, but I was glad that Xymox was trying to recapture its original, more serious sound."
2,why goth sucks,"Once upon a time, Clan of Xymox used to be a unique and interesting dark electro-pop band; now they're satisfied with sounding like every other two-bit goth band out there [if you'd have told me that most of these songs were by Love Like Blood, I'd have believed it]. The lead singer has such a wonderful voice. It's a shame he feels he needs to hide it behind the requisite Andrew Eldritch growl. This is the reason goth sucks: yes, Bauhaus was a good band; yes, Sisters of Mercy was a good band; but there can be so much *more*, and there used to be, at least, in Clan of Xymox. When every new band only strives for mediocrity and knocking off one or two good bands from fifteen or twenty years ago, there's something wrong with the genre. Can you say stagnation, boys and girls?"
3,xymox,"This CD is representative of mediocre goth rock. It features a baritone vocalist invoking the macabre lyrics over a persistent percussion and heavily reverberated guitar with ocassional female sirens to fill the upper registers. If you are interested in music with a good beat that is easy to dance to, or if you are interested in goth rock, this CD may be interesting to you."
3,not up to potential,"Not as good as ""Hidden Faces"", their last CD, and no where near the synthpop stuff in the late 80's, early 90's. I keep waiting for Xymox to surpass the masterpiece ""Medusa"" from the mid 80's, but I may be in for a long wait. Some of the tracks are great Gothic gems, with a good mixture of guitars/keyboards. Other tracks, however, are not worthy of really a brilliant band. I am a big fan and only give the CD 3 stars.John Kroesche"
5,I love Ashleigh!!,This is the best Ashleigh book ever! I loved Ashleigh and Stardust. Stardust reminds me of my horse when I first got her. Ashleigh is funny and I felt sorry for her when bad things happened. This is Joanna Campbell's best book!!!!
2,Delayed over and over to the point of obsolescence,I had this book preordered for about two years before it finally came out AFTER Bryce 5 shipped. You're better off getting a cheap copy of Real World Bryce 3 and waiting for Susan to put out RW Bryce 5... after Bryce 6 ships.A big thumbs down for being out of date due to extreme author lag.
1,Awful!,"The tool-heavy approach to this software makes it very difficult to actually do anything with the software. I had hoped to come away with more than just a rudimentary knowledge of the product, but after several days of frustration, I gave up!"
4,This book is a lot more than the manual,"I'm an occasional Brycer. It's among my favourite software. It has one of the nicest computer user interface, both intertaining and efficient (I think that software interface must be pleasant. And Bryce's is). With Bryce, you produce wonderful landscape in no time. But when you want better control on the software, you need more. This book takes you a lot further than the basic manual. Not just by its comparison of Mac/Win behavior, but by its numerous advises, tests, things to look at, and its simple, entertaining language. I had Real World Bryce 2 and I did not hesitate a second to buy this new Edition. I wouldn't say that it adds a lot compare to the previous release. But if you haven't any Bryce book, look no further. That's the book you want."
5,Best-Loved Hymns,"Short and Sweet....These two artists are a dynamic duo - listening to these beautiful old hymns, you'd think you were already in heaven."
5,there grrrrrreat!,"Being from Atlanta i first heard 6X play on the local college station WRAS 88.5. Granted they weren't really the style of music i listened to at the time i was blown away when i picked the cd up. I can only discribe it as ""fun"" music without being annoying as most ""fun"" music has a habit of being.I was lucky enough to catch them live a couple of times and they were just as impressive live as on their cd. They're broke up now i believe so you won't be seeing their show but pick up this cd and their sophomore release ""Thunder Bomb"". You won't be disappointed... unless you suck of course.^_^"
5,Great song,I hear this all the time as background music. Finally I can turn it up properly. Somehow I missed this song growing up. The distinctive rhythm shows up in other songs.
3,my sharona,enjoyed the c/d. the shipment was done well and I even received a thank you note from the shipper. Something you don't see anymore.
3,french music with brazilian accent,"The songs are well chosen, and you get traditional french songs with a little of brazilian feeling, what makes them specially great. Good for relaxing and dreaming about the next trip to France."
2,Late,Took longer than expected to arrive. I paid extra to have the product arrive 2 days ago and Im still waiting.
1,This book is HORRIBLE!,"This is the WORST book I've ever seen. The authors assume that calculus and differential equations are the second nature to the readers and use complicated mathmatical derivations without any explanation. Furthermore, the topics covered in this book are just too broad and disorganized. After reading a chapter, I wonder, ""what is this chapter about?""Don't buy this book--the only reason that I bought this book is because we use this text book in our class. And only after one term, I am thinking about buying another text. This book is an absolute waste of money."
2,"Decent Text, HORRIBLE SOLN manual","The textbook is okay. The book features a lot of connections to biochemistry, which is where the world is going so that's good. The formula are listed at the end of the book, but their implementation isn't always clear from reading the book.The book also makes you look up a lot of values on tables for the equations .... It's a bit of a pain.The Solutions manual, however, was conceived in the eye of the PChem Devil. The manual features wanton plug and chug of equations, without showing which equations to use. Its methodology for some questions is confusing and, worse still, some of the answers are wrong. Whoever wrote this exam must have a brain tumor that's corrupting their knowledge of Pchem, because I've never seen a worse answer guide."
1,Text book,"I never got the book. It is a good thing I emailed and requested it wasn't sent because I was pretty much forgotten about. The book was out of stock, but no one thought to mention that to me, even though I paid. To their credit however, after contacting them I got a full refund that I received promptly"
1,Prepare to buy suplementary text,"This book is packed with information!!!... now good luck trying to sort through it all. The book is not organized very well, and in deriving some of the equations, they fail to explain how they reached the next step. For the part on Thermodynamics, they brush over some parts that I thought would be important in understanding the whole picture. If you already understand Biophysical Chemistry, this book could be for you, but if it is your first time learning the material, I would try another text."
1,A really confusing text,"This book is not intended for first time learner or a person who wants to study in depth about P-Chem or Bio-P-Chem.If it were not due to uc berkeley's requirement, I would NEVER buy this.The text is lacking of derivations. Easy problems are made to be too complicated. I had to refer to my physics book in order to do the problems.I would not recommend anyone to buy this."
3,good info but it definitely needed more....,"as a former exotic dancer, i bought this dvd to see what it was about. i liked it but i felt Method Man or who ever should have definitely visited more clubs & did more research. Atlanta was the best covered city (as far as strip clubs) they covered Strokers & Magic City which are the 2 hottest clubs in Atlanta. however this video gave los angeles strip clubs no justice at all. they didn't even mention the main black club's in los angeles: Rons Barbary Coast, First King or Starz yet they had 3 very odd looking girls in a hotel to represent l.a. This video should have at the very least visited strip clubs in l.a. somewhere.i felt like there was a time issue (the dvd is only 72 min.) & this documentary was rushed to dvd. i hope there will be a part 2 or at least someone else will do a better documentary on the 'strip game'."
1,Lacked anything interesting....,"Curiosity itself will make you want to check this out. Ok, well I watched and here are a few thingsPros: It's about strippersCons: Most men when they walk in a strip club should have the notion that under most circumstances we are not getting laid and she is there for the money. Methodman only reiterated that fact, with no real insight to the lives of these strippers. Brief interviews with the strippers never really allows you to make a connection, they overall film was forgettable. The quality was pretty harsh. The filming and audio in the club at times was horrible. I'm not sure there was one ""real"" point to the film. It almost seems that Method and crew were more interested in smoking dope than really trying their hand at a documentary. If you can get it for free, by all means. Otherwise use the money and tip a stripper"
1,Total and utter garbage -- buy Airwolf Themes from MP3 Downloads section,"Total and utter waste of dollars. Do NOT NOT NOT NOT NOT NOT buy this trash, but visit Amazon's MP3 DOWNLOADS section and buy the newly-remastered official AIRWOLF THEMES 2CD Soundtrack instead. It's the real deal!"
1,Misleading...,"Such a shame that there are individuals out there who have such a lack of confidence in their work or product that they feel they must resort to deception.AVOID this trash, it isn't what it says it is. There is a website for the official Airwolf soundtrack. They sold out, but indicated there would be more. It, thankfully, IS the real thing. If you're interested go to http://www.airwolfthemes.com/"
1,Rip Off,"If you're expecting a soundtrack recording you'll be sorry you bought this. It is nothing but a techno dance re-mix. And its not even the long version of the Airwolf theme. It just repeats the main opening theme, then a 1 min. drum solo, then back to the open again. And each track sounds almost identical. The only difference is that one track starts out with the drum solo. If you want dance music, fine. You want the soundtrack you're out of luck. Last I heard E-Bay had one go for over $400."
1,"Terrible. AIRWOLF THEMES 2CD is the real deal, not this","The whole reason the official ""Airwolf Themes 2CD Soundtrack"" exists is because of this trash. The WonderWeapon has *nothing* to do with the episodic music used in the original CBS series; 'Airwolf Themes' on the other hand is the real deal as it has involvement by the original composer Sylvester Levay and creator, Don Bellisario.Just type 'Airwolf' into Google and you'll find the official Airwolf Themes Soundtrack site and links to be able to buy AAC/MP3/WMA downloads on Apple iTunes Stores, Pinnacle-Digital, Napster and others. A new sequel Airwolf Themes soundtrack will be released in late 2008. Forget about 'The Blunderweapon', save your money and get the real thing."
1,Pretty Lame,This CD was not at all what I expected. Instead of taking this ground breaking music.. all we get is a kind of techno pop garbage.Do NOT waste your money!
1,altered art=kaka,The changes to the original artists' work on this album cause significant loss to the music quality. What a disappointment!
3,Good spread of popular Latin songs,"If you're one of those Latin song buffs, you might want to check this album out. It has a wide spread of Latin songs ranging from ""La Bamba"" to ""Mas Que Nada"". A good mix of ever popular songs and forgotten one."
1,Don't be sucked in by the title!,"This is not a PARTY album. That would be a collection of songs that make people want to feel festive, get up and dance, or otherwise celebrate. What this album is is a collection of popular to semi popular to rarely heard of ""latin"" tunes. Very few will make you want to get up and dance, or party much at all. Although there are some decent artists mixed in, the album, taken as a whole, is a yawn. This is not the ""best party album in the world, ever"", not even a FAIR party album. There's WAY better music out there for a party!"
3,fun party album,"Most of it is dancable,but I don't think you can get up with it on Light my fire. My favorite is Funky Nassau,that cut alone is worth the price of the whole cd."
4,Very pretty wreath!,I really like this wreath and glad I purchased it.It looks so lovely on our front door for the holidays!
3,Corporate Authors?,"While the book is alright and up to Weldon's usual standards, I'm appalled that she was paid by Bulgari to mention their line of jewellry and whatnot in her book. Read the book, count how many times ""Bulgari"" is mentioned, and then feel free to research these claims on the web. It's sick, and it's a disgrace to see a story developed because of a paid endorsement. Commercial endorsements are everywhere now - can we at least keep books as the last bastion of non-commercial thought?!"
3,"Song selection is great, but recording is fair.","I was quite disappointed that Ryko would put out something that sounds like an amateur recorded it. With that in mind, maybe this was the only recording of this wonderful concert. The song selection is outstanding, however, highlighting Kanda's greatest hits. But again, the flat recording and lack of audience presence on the disk distracts from the harmonious event that happened that day in Central Park. If you are a fan, though, it is definitely worth a listen for its historical charm."
4,A Showcase for Soukous Guitar,"For me, this album is Kanda Bongo Man showcasing guitarist Nene Tshakou. And that's where Kanda's credits lie. This live show is a lead guitar issue. The singer acts as an ""animateur"" paving the ground for the showdown of the plectrist. Tshakou adds electricity to this session with his own solos, while preceding them with the original phrases Diblo Dibala played on studio recordings of most of the tunes on the CD. It's definitely dance music. If you're not prompted to dance by Kanda's calls (Twende! Twende! which in English would roughly translate into Come on! Come on!), you'll most certainly shake your body to Tshakou's compelling licks, which take on special intensity with the trademark repetition of soukous guitarists: Tshakou will repeat a combination of two licks for 30 seconds! Listen to him."
3,Always a favorite.,"Little Anthony and the Imperials have always been a favorite group to me. During the Doo-Wop era, they were one of the top groups. This Cd is best for the casual fan. There are more extensive collections out there for those who want more, but if you just want the hits this will do nicely."
4,Great,This is a great CD with all the memorable songs of the Imperials and listening to Litte Anthony's unique voice.
5,gets better every time you listen to it,"I have been a Marillion fan since the very begining in 1981 and Brave in my opinion has to go down as one of their best.There is something new every time you listen to it,a mixture of darks and lights.You have to give it a few listens and then it will grab you and never let go The closing Great Escape is Marillions finest hour and will blow you away"
2,The last review is pretty accurate,"Many Marillion fans consider this to be among the band's best work, if not THE best, but I cannot understand why. The CD has a few bright spots, but is mostly bland and lifeless. I was a Marillion fan until this was released, although recently I picked up Marillion.com, which is much better IMO."
2,Vocals sink this one.,This is the most progressive recording by Marillion since Fish's departure. In spite of the considerable talents of the musicians within the band this recording suffers considerably due to the poor performance of Steve Hogarth the vocalist. When he restrains himself his vocals are listenable but seem out of place within the context of prog-rock. When he cuts loose he is in danger of sounding a fair bit like the Jon Bon Jovi's of the world. He over-emotes and leaves the music sounded as dated as an 80's era hair band. Marillion really need to consider a change in the vocalist's chair. Hogarth just doesn't cut it. Return to Fish era Marillion or turn to the Flower Kings or Transatlantic. Save your money and give this one a pass..Simon
2,Boring,"I tried like hell to like this album, as many internet prog fans rave about it, but after multiple listenings, I have now declared this album a total and complete dud. It is just boring. It is hard to believe that with all of the great unknown prog bands that Marillion is one of the more known ones. Lesser known prog bands like The Flower Kings and Spock's Beard blow them out of the water. Do not waste your money on this unless you want music to put you to sleep. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is that I give Marillion credit for trying to keep the prog name alive. They just happened to fail miserably in their attempt."
4,Must have...,"All these reviews point to many aspects of this album...good or bad. Plain and simple, this album is a triumph. Musically, it is deeply textured and diverse, creating an atmosphere of sound that paints a vivid backdrop for the theme. Vocally, Hogarth hits home. He delivers the lyrical content with a true balance of emotion and power. There are some parts that could be removed without missing them...but not enough to detract from the over all strenght of the album. If you didn't see it in the initial Marillion albums with Hogarth, then this album, by far, punctuates the fact that this band is capable of so much more, leaving Fish behind."
4,Brave indeed.,"I am taken aback by the two previous posts. Boring? I think not. Perhaps the concept threw them. The album is atmospheric and Pink Floydesque. There are hard rocking tunes on the disc too though. Give this a shot AFTER buying Misplaced Childhood, Script for a jester's tear, or Clutching @ straws. Good listening!"
5,"Beautiful, powerful, emotional...a sonic masterpiece","This album is best described by lead singer Steve Hogarth...""Brave is like a Christmas cake...full of many layers that reveal themselves gradually...listen to it loud with the lights off...it will improve your chances of hearing the ghosts""..."
5,What a Musical Masterpiece.,"Concept albums are curse words to the music world today. Or so they say. Most people would say who cares, as long as the album is good. Well, Brave is not good, it is a total MASTERPIECE. The album will make rock, make you think, and make you cry. The whole album is a storyline about a girl with a rough childhood and attempts suicide. The music of the album fits the lyrics like a glove. This is lyrically Marillion's best work. Put your headphones on and listen to this with lyric booklet in front of you. Listen to the stand outs like the pulsating rocker Hard as love (definitly a song to get your frustrations out.), to the beauty and fanfare of the song Great Escape, and the beauty of Made Again, along with the other great songs on this album. you will be hooked onthis album after the first listen. ENJOY!"
3,Almost,"This album had a sense of greatness to it. What I like about Marillion is that they're a 70's sounding band. Unfortunately on this album it's almost as if they tried too hard to make an epic album.Interestingly, they spent alot of time recording (re-recording?) the album- see the liner notes. Finally, I think the lead vocalist could shut up once in awhile-ala U2. The band has alot to offer instrumentally."
2,Great CD.. poor quality control,"I really like this CD, have been a fan of Marillion for a long time. But EMI did a poor job on quality control when it came to the liner notes. The covers (front and back, and inside front and back) are correct, but the inside pages containing the lyrics or not for Brave, they are for Holidays in Eden. I thought this was a fluke.. but got a second one and it had the same problem. Not sure ow wide spread this problem is, I have been unable to get an answer. So if not having the proper liner notes is not a problem get this one..if not having the proper liner notes is a problem beware when ordering. But get this if you are a Marillion fan."
3,A bit slower,"Nice although a bit slower than the studio work. The version of Broad Daylight is not as catchy, but still good."
2,Frustrating...,"Although Dragon's Treasure showed a great deal of promise, and the third book might be worth the read, it fell short in a great many places for me. Pro's were 1) not an overly long read; 2) character building was very real; 3) beautiful writing style I enjoyed. Con's: 1) No single main character. The story, told from the perspectives of a few instead of many would of been more effective. 2) Random violence that, although building depth in characters, was yucky to read through. 3) The sexual relationship between the Dragon Lord and his male singer was weird for me. I was in no way prepared when it cropped up in the middle."
4,The Gazebo in the Maze and Yukon Affair,"The first episode is another best from the first season of Man from UNCLE. Gazebo in the Maze Affair is about a man, Emery Partridge who lures Illya and Napoleon to his place to have revenge on when UNCLE had foiled one of his plans to control his own country in South America. The second episode is the Yukon affair, where Partridge returns, this time working for THRUSH to obtain a very rare and heavy metal in the Yukon area. Illya and Napoleon are sent to stop his plans. The first episode is lots of fun with lots of Illya, but the Yukon affair, though very funny, has a very weak plot."
3,From b/w to color,This exemplifies the direction the show took from magnificent monochrome to crazy color. It starts out acceptable and ends poorly. Strong to weak. This one makes me hesitant to buy pro tapes.
2,Not the best,This isn't one of the high points in the UNCLE series. The titular computer doesn't act as much more than a McGuffin and the plot is so thin that the writers had to desperately pad out Napoleon Solo walking across a courtyard to fill in screen time. This one needed wither another subplot to carry it or having the producer throw up his hands and change the format to half an hour.
3,not for me,"They are lightweight and soft leather with a flexible sole. However, there was something about the way they fit my feet that didn't work for me. There is nothing unusual about my feet (no surgery or conditions). I tried normal width first and they were too narrow. Although I don't normally order ""wide,"" I tried it. Still not right. Also, I thought the length ran large, and nobody mentioned that. I normally wear a 6.5, but needed a 6. I returned them all and am trying a new style. The price would've been right if they were a perfect fit, otherwise not worth it."
3,nurse mates slip ons,"The shoes ran a little smaller and so I had to exchange them to a half size bigger. I did not have any problems with the exchange. The shoe is a wide, but still feels a bit snug, but at least it fits better now. I am not sure I would buy this brand again. I well have to wear it for a couple of months to see how it performs."
5,Great supportive shoe!,"This is my 2nd time ordering these shoes. The shoes are well made, and long lasting. I feel like I am wearing house slippers when I wear these shoes yet they are supportive to my high arch. The shoes seem to run true to size. They are of good quality and long lasting. i highly recommend these shoes for those of us who do a lot of standing and/or walking."
2,Not sure what all the hype is about,The Nurse Mates were very nice looking and lightweight as described. But I felt they lacked arch support. I stand in one spot for eight hours a day and even after wearing these my feet and back ached at the end of the day. These just didn't cut it for me. :-(
1,wear off leather,"I have had my shoes for 2 weeks, I work in a school lunchroom and the white leather is already cracking and the white paint is coming off.If you have to do anything in water like mop these are not the shoes for you."
5,A must for all nurses and nursing students in the clnical area,This is a must have item for all nurses and nursing students in the clinical area. they are extremely comfortable and durable.They ease the weight off your feet so that after a long day the bottom of your feet does not feel sore. Received the item in record time. I am totally satisfied with the service from shoeline
2,ok...for awhile,"I've had these shoes for a little over a year. They were ok for about the first year. I used to work 10-12 hour days with no real issues with the shoes or pain in my heels/feet. Now I'm working 8 hour days as a nurse and my heels/feet hurt when I get home. These shoes seem to lack the side support you can get with laced shoes. I am at a loss for what to do...I like the protection of the slip on shoe, but I like the support of a laced shoe..."
1,nurse mate shoes,"I purchased the shoes in June and I had to buy a new pair of work shoes already and it's only October. The shoes were a real dissapointment. They were no better than shoes from Payless shoes. Do not recomment at all.I am a waitress an on my feet all day, so I was expecting better from nurse mates."
1,Bad customer service!!!!!!,"This company is a rip off and has bad customer service!!!!!! I bought some nurse mate Bryars a few weeks ago and when I got them I noticed a strong rubber smell, which I thought eventually would go away. After a few weeks, the smell was so strong that my co workers were noticing the smell. I was so embarrassed!! I tried the shoe powders and inserts but still nothing could make the smell go away. So I called nurse mates and they said the shoes were defective and that they would be happy to exchange them. Well I get a phone call stating that they found no smell and I could BUY new ones if I wanted to! Are you kidding me!? Numerous amounts of people told me they smelled really bad and all of a sudden they don't!? I was told they have a guarantee but apparently not. I will never be buying from nurse mates again, I'm better off without the nasty smelly shoes!!!!"
3,One was worn,One of the shoes already had creases in it from wear when the package arrived. Other than that they are alright.
4,MY SHOES,"I work in a restaurant every day need walking shoes for me, is very important, this pair of shoes, very lightweight, very comfortable."
2,Leather wore off 2 hours into shift!,"I have trouble finding shoes that are wide enough, but was please to slip these shoes on with ease when they first arrived. I was two hours into my shift when I looked down and saw the leather was already wearing off. I'm not picky with appearances and since I have a hard time finding shoes wide enough I ignored the issue. I've been wearing these shoes for two weeks now and my feet are still not used to them and I come home with sore feet and ankles."
2,Nurse mates dove shoes,"For me, these shoes were not good at all. the look is nice but the fit is totally uncomfortable. It's unfortunate as I do need a comfortable shoes for my job."
4,Where is ocean in motion?,"Great disk but...How can you have a greatest hits disk without Jon's first hit with the JBA? Where is ""Ocean in motion""? Maybe it's me. Having grown up in the Boston area I have been a Jon Butcher fan since the late 70's early 80's. I just wish this one song had been included."
5,Wonderful Release!,"A fantastic CD that captures the many facets of this talented singer/songwriter/guitar wizard. Ranging from hard rock to romantic, Butcher is a socio-intellectual messenger who powers the message home with vocals, guitar licks, and arrangements that won't quit! Great musicians abound on these tracks. Highly recommended for blues fans as well as arena rock heads!Bring back the Jon Butcher Axis. I want to see these guys live."
4,Another great 80s band that seemingly came from nowhere,"The Jon Butcher Axis was yet another band that seemed to come out of nowhere to give the world a great song then fall off the edge of the earth. The Axis recorded four albums in the 80s (of which Stare at the Sun is far and away the best) before Jon Butcher--for a time heralded as rock's next great guitarist--released his solo debut, Pictures from the Front, in 1989. For me, ""Don't Say Goodnight"" will always be a special song from a special time."
5,Serious workout,Get Ripped! with Jari Love: Get Ripped & ChiseledThis is a great workout for anyone who is serious about getting in shape. I highly recommend any of Jari's DVD's. Get Ripped 1000 is my favorite but I do them all to change it up. If you do her tapes 3 times a week as she suggests you WILL see results but you do have to work for them.
2,good music bad vinyl,i think i already reviewed this record i love the music of fairport convention and have been looking for this album for awhile but when i recieved it the first tracks on both sides(a&b) were defective due to what appeared to be a manufacturing defect which rendered them unplayable the record was returned and the money was refunded end of story
3,Disappointing,"After ""What We Did on our Holidays,"" this album felt like a let-down to me. Both Percy's Song and A Sailor's Life are good songs but go on way, way, WAY too long. Talk about repetitive. ""Si Tu Dois Partir"" also falls into the ""too long"" category.There are true gems on this album -- especially ""Who Knows Where The Time Goes,"" which is a timeless classic. But there are also mediocre songs. The Dylan covers are nowhere near as great as something like ""I'll Keep It With Mine.""However, this is worth buying if only for ""Autopsy"" and ""Who Knows Where The Time Goes."""
1,Terrible interpretation of the drug,"This was more of a horror movie and is not what the actual drug ""ecstasy"" does to a person. This director/producer obviously has never done the drug or did not research it very well."
3,Product is exactly as described,"The product is exactly as described, but what I found is that in reality it sounds a lot more user friendly than it really is. I found that I only even looked through it a few times. Flash cards really would have been more ideal because instead of folding or tearing the page corners you could just set the words aside once you learned them."
4,Well... I cant come up witha title...,"As a guy with a strange taste of music I can still find french rap the probably best rap in the world. I like such artists as Black Uhuru and almost all djungel reagge with all from Bob Marley to Sizzla. Iam, Fonky Family, Ntm, Manau... I am part french so i understand most of the lyrics... Its good music for a younger generation.... GOOD BYE !"
2,This does nothing for me,"In the world of English folk, this is supposed to be a landmark album. I like Steleye Span, Richard Thompson, Nick Drake and the Strawbs but I do not like this. It is too weird and has nothing in common with conventional popular music.This is way too English, way too folkie (in a middle ages/minstrel way!) and not aligned with any aspect of conventional rock and roll. I listened to it once, put it away and have not touched it in 5 years.You know when you go to one of those ""Renaissance fairs"", drink and have a great time. This is for the eccentric people that act in the Renaissance fairs."
5,One of the most WONDERFUL albums OF ALL TIME !!!!!!,"Hangman's Beautiful daughter by Mike Heron & Robin Williamson is capable of putting happiness & sunlight into your deepest inner self. A Very Cellular Song is nothiing short of true MAGIC !!! It conveys the essence of the cycles of life from birth through death & beyond. a fascinating metamorphises which is rarely found in a musical format. since it's release in 1968 this album has never left the sales charts !!!! If you want to own one of the most magically beautiful musical collections of all time, make sure that "" Hangman's Beautiful Daughter"" is in your collection."
5,The leader in Autism,"I will keep it short...This book contains the most up to date information currently available on Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).It is not an easy read, but if you are a student, professional, or a parent who wants the background, the studies, the experiments, the techniques, etc than this is for you.Bottom Line...Any professional working with ASD should have this book in their library to use as a reference and guide"
4,Timeless collection from a master,"There can be no question about Art Blakey's contribution to Jazz. He is among a handful of drummers that helped bring about a quantum leap foward in jazz drumming. This collection is a timeless display of Blakey's signature combination of power, finesse, and intensity. It features many of the established and up and coming members of his bands over the years performing signature Blakey tunes. A ""must have""."
2,Unprofessional Production,"I have to wonder if many of the other reviews were written by friends of the dance group which made this video. The instruction is decent, and the dancers talented. However, most of the time is spent on inane, unscripted chatter and incredibly repetitive pitches for another video produced by the same group. Makes watching the video so annoying I mute it. Might have given it 3 stars, but am trying to counterbalance the apparent over-rating."
2,Im a real breakdancer and i say DONT BUY THIS,"Ok well i watched previews of the dvd and it has moves such asTHE MOONWALKTHE WOPTHE BUTTERFLYTHE HERLEM SHAKETHE James Brownthe mc hammer dance.... I am a real breakdancer and as far as im aware this isnt breakdancing (bboying) at all, This should dvd shud be renamedIt is meant to be a breakdance instructional, And it doesnt even teach you simple moves like the toprock,uprock, or floatsIf your looking for a good breakdance dvd buy breakdance step by stepyou want to know the truth, ??This guy is not a real bboy, and he doesnt know more than 3 breakdance moves , and 4 of his moves are actually hip hop moves and the rest are all made up by him to fill in the gaps, He made up atleast 13 of the moves, AND IT SAYS BREAKDANCE, I dont even use three quarters of his moves he teaches THIS DVD IS ""STUPID"" , Im telling the truth"
3,"Bad, yet funny, instructional","Most of these are not Bboy moves! The turtle, windmill, baby freeze, and coffee grinder are the only bboy moves on the dvd. The rest are old school dances like the cabbage patch. C'mon!>:(Watch the 4 bboy segments on Youtube and buy ""Breakdance Step by Step"" instead. Or the ""How to Breakdance"" series by Mike Garcia aka Breaker.This is a funny DVD until you think about the $27 wasted."
1,The reviews are fakes done by the producers!,"The majority of moves on this dvd are not bboy moves. I know these guys and they are ripping you off. Do not purchase this dvd. The Elastic Illusion company made up all these reviews (except the negative ones!). In fact, I suspect if Amazon checked the IP addresses of the reviews, they would find them mostly done from just a couple computers."
5,Step aside Fred! Move over Marvin...,All I have to say is that Montrell Darrett has created gospel perfection with this album. I loved it when i first heard it years ago and I'm loving it still. How refreshing to have the right kinda music with the right kinda beats and THE RIGHT SPIRIT! Amen!
2,2 stars,"i loved listening to darrett,every since he sang with john p. kee & commissioned. he has the most natural feel for funk & soul that i've heard since david hollister. although this album dealt with serious issues - i was a bit un-inspired. i really liked ""sorry"" and ""free"", but it was almost like he was a different artist."
1,lawncare,"Not what I expected, too smaill but mayve I didn't read the discription closely anyway not good for what I wanted to use it for."
3,a little disapointed,My 3 years old is crazy about any books or DVD that feature princesses or barbies so I was very happy to find something interactive featuring her favorite heroines. But I didn't quite get the success I was expecting. Utilization is simple enough for a 3 year old and esthetic satisfactory but I find most of the games short and boring and my daughter very seldom ask to play with it.
2,kind of boring,"My 3 yr old daughter loves princesses, and so was quite excited to try this. But she is pretty bored and unchallenged by this book"
1,Couldn't use it,Should have specified that the book can only be used with the leappad system. Bought it as a present and the child does not have one.
5,Mystery play come mystery novel,"This is one novel, I couldn't put down and finished in a little over a day. Hill has a great style. It was been sometime that I novel had me reaching for a dictionary to look up definitions. The Yorkshire dialect was just perfect.The characters are well drawn and the plot winds in on itself just enough. I am looking forward to reading other Reginald Hill novels."
5,Great device even for first time Blackberry user,"I've never used a Blackberry before, but found this device to be fantastic. The green and red buttons perform the same familiar functions as my old cell phone, but the nifty screen and easy interface makes it better than a smartphone. I had been told it would be difficult to use a Blackberry, and was a bit intimidated by this, but I found that the functions became second nature very quickly. Overall, a great device!"
4,much improved over 7100t,"I have a 7100t but have been thinking about upgrading to the 8700g. After trying it out at the local T-Mobile store, I was pretty impressed.Pros: Big, gorgeous screen. Full QWERTY keyboard. Phone is much more responsive and web page renders much faster (compared to 7100t). Scratch-resistant plastic. E-mail fully synchronized with Yahoo and Gmail accounts.Cons: Big, gorgeous screen sucks battery dry in no time. The T-Mobile salesperson said theirs lasts about a day. Phone is quite large. The QWERTY keyboard makes it hard to dial a number by letter, e.g. 1-866-IDOLS-01. Also the keys are kinda small.So I was impressed, but not enough to switch yet. Heard Samsung is coming out w/ a clamshell Blackberry phone. I can wait..."
3,"rating would be higher, if it weren't for hidden Activation Fee (beware!)","Beware! There is a $35.00 ""one time activation fee"" that will appear on your first bill.I've done my best to find any mention of this fee (billed by T-Mobile) on this order page, or any other documentation. No such luck.As far as the phone:5 stars for being an amazing device (they don't call it ""Crackberry"" for nothing).4 stars for service coverage (my experience around Seattle - Seattle is perfect, outlying areas are sketchy. You may have better/worse luck - be sure to check your coverage maps first)-1 star for the hidden activation fee!"
1,BEWARE - CONTRACT IS LONGER,"They state that you have to have service for at least 181 days. However, when you add the phone and select the type of service you want, the next page is how much you'll have to pay and to add additional services. On this page it says ""T-Mobile 2 Year Contract""This is bad trick, stay away!!!"
3,Must include warning....or bracing for a class action,"This is my first Blackberry. It is beautiful. But it needs a huge warning from its maker. The rolling weel is not good for your thumb. Had I read 'my' review before, I would be at least careful in using it, at least by changing hands and fingers.In any case, a second problem is that you can't dial numbers from 'mnemonics', such as 1-800-dominos because it does not have a standard phone dialpad.A third problem seems to be that it does not delete messages from Blackberry even if I delete them from my email account, which results in a LOT of unnecessary rolling everytime you check email.Unfortunately, of all the phones I ever had, this is the most annoying. I sent a feedback to RIM and mentioned the thumb and requested that I be called back sans a response.Good luck!"
1,Defective device,The Blackberry I received was defective and unrepairable. I learned that when I took it to TMobile for help getting my email set up when I was not able to. The good news news is how easy Amazon made it for me to return the Blackberry and how quickly they credited the full amount including shipping back to my cc. That deserves 5 stars!
2,not much drawing instruction,"The first thing Betty Edwards tells us (in the preface): she was not trained as an educator. Consequently, she met with great frustration trying to teach her high school students to draw. What did she do? Write a long-winded, theoretical book about why it is so hard to teach people to draw.You are, perhaps, a person who has tried to draw but felt frustrated because you have not gotten good training or instruction.Option 1: use this book = spend a lot of time reading, not much time drawing, end up with lots of excuses why drawing is so hard.Option 2: use Keys to Drawing by Bert Dodson (a skilled instructor) = read a little, draw a lot, watch your skills grow, feel happy doing what you love to do, forget drawing was once difficult and frightening."
5,Fast service,Thanks for the great service. The book arrived in new condition as promised and quickly. Thank you.
2,HOW COME KINDLE VERSION DISAPEARED,"I was going to get the kindle version. I downloaded the sample, but when i wanted to bought the full book, it wasn't available anymore."
3,Only for the untalented...,"Okay, first let me say that this is an okay book only for those who are not an artist or just starting. I had this as a text book(drawing course for graphic design major in a small tech/bus school), and being I've been drawing since I could hold a writing utensil I found it slightly insulting, especially being in a graphic design course. It's really only for the untalented, along yes, I did get something from it the grids...but that's it."
1,Great Book,"I'm enjoying going through the exercises, and I plan to take a week long class using this book soon. I would HIGHLY recommend it!"
4,Drawing review,"Very good book, but the first couple of chapters a bit repetitive and I could have done without so much of the science. Other than that, the work and descriptions of how to ""get into the zone"" is very good. For any beginning artist I would recommend this book, o the older editions."
5,Great Book,"This is a really great book! The exercises are great, and there is lots of interesting information. I definitely recommend this book for anyone who wants to learn how to draw!"
4,The New Drawing On The Right Side Of The Brain,"I was disappointed at first, but after I followed instructions in the book, it really improved my drawings. My drawings are so good it looks like someone else did them,"
4,Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"While this is a great book, realize that you will be doing a great deal of reading to learn how to draw."
4,Change Your Approach To Drawing! Recommended,"My wife and I have taken art lessons for a few years and have advanced from crude sketches to frameable drawings. We augmented our professional lessons with ""The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain"", and we both saw a marked improvement in the quality of our work.The best way to describe the central theme is ""disassociation"". Stop thinking about what you are drawing in terms of words (""Left Brain"") and start breaking them down into shapes (""Right Brain""). The techniques and instructions in the book get you to start thinking correctly when looking at your subject. It sounds somewhat silly, but it really does work.My only real complaint is that the writing is a little wordy and the same results could have been achieved in fewer pages, but this in no way detracts from the value of this excellent book.Highly recommended!"
5,Excellent,Excellent for people who think they can't draw. YOU CAN!!! It's a skill that you can learn and this book can help to give you the confidence to know how to start.
