3,Good,The shredder was bought and used maybe twice. Stored in closet for about a month and didnt work when tried.Seller said they bought it from a store and cannot issue refund or replacement. I had to eat almost 50 dollars =(

Who's next I wonder.If you have yet to read Jayes series here is the list so farDouble Image - AfterImage - Shadow Image and this one Immortal Image. Excellent and they are keepers.
2,Scientific Interactive Planetarium,"This toy was recommended for children between 5 - 12 years old. I bought it for my grandson, who just turned 5. The toy was quite boring and way too advanced for a 5 year old - even one as interested in Space and planets as this one. I would NOT recommend it for anyone."
4,Good bang for the buck..,"This is a real value. For this price you can't go wrong. We bought it to take on vacation for use in the car and at home as a portable DVD player to be used in the kid's rooms and basement.The 6"" picture quality OK, not the best but i was not expecting that.The playback on a TV is good too much better than I expected. If the kids break this, it is not like i am out [....] Buy it..you'll like it!!"
4,"Solid product, few glitches","I've had this player for about 2 weeks now and overall have found it to be very good. The picture is great, and the features are good. The built in speakers could have been better but they do the job. The main problems I've had has been with it's ability to overheat if it's not on a solid well ventilated surface, also the picture skips at the slightest vibration. The thing is loaded with cautions and warnings saying that just about anything will void the warrenty or cause it to melt down. Overall, it does the job and the price is unbeatable. I would reccommend this unit to someone who is looking for something bare bones and is on a budget."
1,Further News,"After much effort Audiovox finally agree to replace the DVD player...however it arrived not in the original container (Is it a rebuilt one being passed off as new?) and missing the cord that connects the power converter to the wall as well as the RCA plug cables that connect it to the TV...I have no way of knowing if it works and have asked if they would be so kind as to send cables...The front plate is falling off, but I can live with it that since it appears to be just a cosmetic issue...Also I don't know why but in the box was the paper work for a return of a MVP 200 package (mobile VCR unit which wouldn't play)...it was installed by Columbus Car Audio for a Ms. Aimee Novak of Westerville Ohio...Why I have this paperwork, may expalin why my paperwork was missing when I sent mine in...It appears as if Quality Control is maintaining the standard I have come to expect."
1,You get what you pay for,"When portable CD players came out, we had problems with pausing. The slightest twinge caused mine to pause. I kept mine in the family room when I first tested it and it still paused. I am returning mine because of this and the monitor did not work. If I buy another one I am going to go higher quality and look for one that can take a few bumps."
2,Hate it,"I bought this DVD player about a month ago and have been cursed with skipping and freezing. Sometimes it even cut back to the beginning of the DVD. The only reason it got 2 stars was because of the features it has. Believe you me Audiovox willbe getting a nasty gram from me. Word to the wise, find another DVD player."
1,Problems galore,"The idea behind a piece of portable equipment is ... Are you listening Audivox?... PORTABILITY! The mechanism in this thing is so sensitive?/delicate?/fragile! that it mistracks at the slightest jarring. I have actually had to send the thing back to the USA to have it repaired. You would think that a product designed to be portable would be a bit more rugged.Even after having it repaired, it continues to flatly refuse to play some DVDs while others seem to work fine. As for design, it is the portable equivalent of an orthopaedic shoe, occasionally functional but always very chunky and clunky.For overseas buyers, take note that according to the people I spoke to at Audivox, it is also impossible to make the thing multi-regional.A thoroughly disappointing product."
3,the big bulky one,i bought this dvd player and as soon as i took it out of the box it was much bigger than what i thought it looked like. but i put in my movie and it froze up. i tap it and it started back up and than froze again. so i called the manufacture 800 number and they told me even though i bought it on line used... i can send it back under the manufature warrenty. and that made me happy. so as long as it wooks when i get it . I'll be ahead of the game for the price =) Well i just got my player back and they gave me a brand new unit. Thats what i call customer service with a smile =)
1,Not a Reliable Product,"My son bought the Audiovox DVD1500 portable DVD player in early November 2001. He doesn't use it very much and takes good care of it. He even has a padded bag where he stores it when not in use. We have had to send this product back to Audiovox in New York twice; Nov 26, 2001 and Mar 18, 2002 at our expense...The first time the DVD player would not play at all, which Audiovox was prompt ( approximately 3 weeks) in sending us a new DVD player, and the second time because the picture would not show up on the portable screen, although we could hear the sound. Audiovox promptly (within about 3 weeks) returned the DVD player to as with a note that they could not find anything wrong, but they cleaned it. It currently is working, but I would rather have received a refund the second time. Buyer beware."
1,TERRIBLE,"It is very rare to be able to play a dvd the whole way through. Inevitably, at a peak moment in the movie, it will freeze and skip. Once that starts happening, forget it. It will never recover, so the only option is to shut it down. Even then, good luck in getting it going again. I am not sure why it skips. At first I thought it was due to movement, but seems to be able to take movement for the most part, and will skip even when perfectly still. I have also tried cleaning the discs, but that doesn't seem to help. I have decided that it is because this player is a piece of junk. It is so frustrating trying to watch something and have it act up for no apparent reason. I have been tempted to toss the thing against the wall many times. If you are in the market for a portable dvd player, DO NOT BUY THIS ONE. Buy a laptop or a more reliable portable dvd player instead. We won this dvd player from a technology conference, so the only comfort we have is that it was free."
2,Clunky and poor resolution,"Got this item excitedly (price and specs) and opened it to find it had a defective pixel in the screen. I also noticed the resolution was poor (lots of pixelation-like artifacts) and the thing was just big and clunky.Not recommended for those that were looking for a bargain, but could afford a little more."
4,fiercely performed Bruckner is here,"This Urania Bruckner CD is the same recording as of newly remastered ""Testament"" CD(printed as 1949. 14th march). The sound quality is little worse than the ""Testament"" CD. But the performance has Furtwangler's intensity and strength. Very good performance and the sound quality is good enough to enjoy."
2,Distorted Adagio,"Very good performance, but adagio of the third movement is little bit disappointing because the sound quality doesn't represent the beauty of the strings. The sound is somewhat distorted. The other movements are good."
3,"Hip, Funky, Background Music","I guess I won't earn too many votes here, but I have to side more with the detractors than the boosters. Yes, the combination of Motown/Muscle Shoals-inflected bass, snappy drums, cool retro-organ, and slinky, post-fusion guitar is a pleasing one. But after hearing the CD once or twice, the novelty of the sound wears off and you start wondering what the actual point is. The melodies and solos are neither exciting nor particularly memorable. The emotional content stays at the same level from one track to the next. The instrumentation never varies. Such a format is probably great for party background music, but it doesn't provide much interest for attentive listening.By the way, if you want to hear cool, Sixties pop/jazz with a danceable beat, try to dig up an old Billy Larkin And The Delegates record, or even Lee Morgan's ""The Sidewinder."" Those guys will show you how it's done."
3,"Good, but barely average for Sco","This is a good album, though a few of the tracks are fairly uninspired. Not sure why it's so highly praised. I think MMW freaks are more into it than Sco freaks. I'm a Sco freak, and to my ears, he's recorded much better albums. (Hand Jive, Groove Elation, Uberjam, Up All Night, Bump). MMW's music is a bit too diffuse for me; I don't have the patience to wait around for them to get inspired. Scofield's music is much more focused and disciplined, even when he's ""jamming."" Neither his writing nor his playing on this album are up to his usual standards."
5,"This album is so good, it's ridiculous.","The very few bad reviews of this album are absurd. I have been grooving to and studying these tunes since the day the album came out. There is a deluge of ideas, soul, interplay and images pouring out throughout this gritty CD. These cats never settles and they still nailed stuff in one or two takes. Everytime I've played this album and someone was within earshot it's ""Wow! Who is this? This is hot."" Scofield is a genius and I do not use that term lightly. Get A Go GO."
3,"Good, but not great","MMW are nice additions to Sco's guitar, but they tend to, well... wander. This a jazzy record, with lots empty space between the notes, one to snap your fingers and bob your head to. Pleasant enough, but not as groovin' as ""Bump,"" the CD that followed. (Disclosure: I did buy ""Bump"" first, so that undoubtedly influenced my perception of this record.)"
3,Not a good as I hoped it'd be,"Sometimes combining two big jazz players (or a player and a group) can result in something great. Think Thelonious Monk & John Coltrane. Ornette Coleman & Pat Metheny. This disc is an example, though, of 1 + 1 = 1 1/2. While John Scofield is his usual impeccable self, MM&W holds back too much. The songs are all written by Scofield, so I imagine MM&W couldn't adapt to his tunes. Maybe they shouldn't have spent more time together developing a good groove. At any rate, there are good songs, ""Hottentot"" (a few different groups cover Hottentot in shows found on the Live Music Archive), ""Jeep on 35"", ""Green Tea"", ""Chank"" & ""Boozer"". All in all, though, it's just not very inspiring to listen to."
4,this will not disappoint!,"Sco working with the ultimate backing band, and do they ever lay it down. Stellar playing and these guys are all about POCKET. MMW and Scofield compliment each other so well on this album, never stepping on each other or getting in the way. Songs like Hottentot, Green Tea, Chank and the title track groove in a huge way and are perfect examples of what this album is all about."
5,If you like MMW you'll love this album! as well as Scofield,"those of you who are fans of MMW, will find this to be as good as one of their own, and probably consider this their ""new album"". But, this is in fact John Scofields new album, and it is awesome! It is definately the return of Scofield. He is larger than life on this album. All the tunes were written by him and he could not have picked a better back up than MMW. They fit in this album like a freakin glove. and boy do they fit with Scofield. not only do they fully participate in this album, they excenuate Scofields new style. Buy this album . you wont be disappointed. Even if you dont like Scofield, you will like this one. If you like MMW you will love this album!!"
4,Amazing Chemistry Here,"This is more than a nice little album, MMW & Scofield gel perfectly together. After a few listens you will soon find yourself sad this is not an actual ""touring band."" I won't mention high points of the album in this review as it's a lot more fun to discover them yourself. 3.26.02"
1,TOTALLY BORING,"I THINK HE HAD ALL HIS FRIENDS TO REVIEW THIS DISC HOW CAN SO MANY ACTUALLY FIND THIS SO GOOD OF A CD,I HAVE HEARD TEENAGERS PLAY WITH MORE STYLE, THIS ALBUMS REALLY BITES, BE WISE DON'T LISTEN TO ALL THOSE 5 STAR RATINGS, BUY CARLTON, RITENOUR,OR ANYONE THAT HAS ANY STYLE AT ALL, THIS IS REALLY A TRUE PEACE OF GARBAGE"
3,Sharp Nine Festival,"An enjoyable but somewhat repetitious foray into jazz-funk land. If you're familiar with the sharp-nine chord, that will tell you everything you need to know about this recording and its feel. For me, it became refreshing on the rare cuts where a different harmonic pallette was used. I got the sense that most of the tunes were throw-aways that may have been concocted on the fly. Nothing too wrong with that (see Kind of Blue), but if you're looking for something more, look elsewhere. Good party record, though."
3,"A Fun, Funky Album","Scofield and MM&W turn in a fun, refined, and funky performance which is guarante ed to get you tapping your feet. However, hardcore jazz guitar aficionados may wish to che ck out some of Sco's earlier disks for some more substantial axework.

2,boring and old fashioned,"Sorry to disappoint you Scofield fans, but this album gives me a good reason not to start buying his albums. The music is in the era of very early Jimi Hendrix recordings, except of course Hendrix could express himself a hundred times better than Scofield on the guitar. My second thought is that Larry Carlton has played these kinds of sounds producing incredible guitaring, whereas Scofield seems so uncomfortable trying to get through each piece. He sounded like a novice improvising poorly, and didn't seem to really get into the groove of the tunes. In conclusion, either Scofield should not be playing this kind of music or else he is not as good as everyone seems to be telling me. Ritenour, Carlton, Coryell etc would blow Scofield away if they played on this album. Sorry folks."
5,Holy S**t! This is sonic bliss!,"This album really changed my life. I had been wallowing in a sea of musical mediocrity and then I heard this disc! I had almost lost hope in music-kind. The only way this album won't affect you is if you're deaf and have no soul whatsoever. Otherwise, you're gonna be getting groovelicous. Medeski, Martin, and Wood are a perfect match for John Scofield's soulful and almost crying guitar riffs, which you can tell he's holding back to the point of pain! When he lets go, watch out! He'll send a chill up your spine and then bathe you in funk! What an absolute pleasure! - Carl Franklin"
4,Groovy,Just got this based on a friend's recommendation - great listening and wonderful addition to my music collection.
2,Not matching item,"Item arrived, did not fit the car wiring.Tried to send it back but have to pay certified mail which cost more than the item.Did not bother to send back.Vendor should have provide a return labelThis is real customer service."
1,Show But No Go,"This multi-tool set is really pretty, but it is all show and no go. The tools are so heavy and clunky that they are difficult to use. The jig saw has an extra button on the power head that makes it very difficult to use. You actually have to push a button with both hands to get it to work. All of the tools are very noisy and require ear protection to use. The batteries have a very short life and a very long charging time. If you accidentally leave them on the charger it will distroy them. I bought this set for my son for Christmas, but the little elves that built it were obviously not tool makers. I'm sending the whole mess back. No more Black and Decker for me!"
1,no power,"this tool has no power. the jigsaw is only vertical movement so it only cuts thin things with any speed, so it drains the power when up against anthing substantial."
2,Old-Tech,"As you can see, the other reviews date all the way back to 2000, which tells you that this product was designed a long time ago compared to other cordless tools and batteries available today. This set was, in it's prime, pretty good. I bought it for my mom for Xmas 2001 (which has only been used a couple of times,) and bought one for myself (to replace my Ryobi 12v) a year laterOne of my (2) batteries became very aenemic after a year, and the other one's pretty much shot now. For light household use, the driver's pretty much average for a 12v, but the saw and sander eat up the poor capacity NiCD's pretty quick. Forget about replacing the batteries, too, since they are the same capacity as the originals, and about $50 a pop! I may share in some of the blame for the relatively short life of the batteries, because the charger has no trickle or shut-off feature, and who can remmber to remove them from the charger in a timely fashion every time?I saw a MUCH newer B"
4,Great value tool,"I have used this tool to help build a large extention to our house and have found it to be a great unit. I have screwed ~75 roofing screws through galvinised iron roofing on 1 charge. The saw was a very pleasant surprise it cuts faster than expected even through tin. The sander appears to work well but I have only used it for a small job. You should not compare the saw to 500+ watt pendulum saws, but the convenience of no cord is superb and it does feature a roller guide.In Australia it comes with a one hour charger that works well, and as a bonus the drill and saw work (suprisingly well) with older 9.6 volt B&D; batteries."
3,Small Jobs Made Pretty Easy,"The main things I don't like about this tool are, the lack of a high torque setting and the jig saw is really short on power.It is pretty descent for thin wood such as 1/4 plywood.If you don't want to buy alot of tools this one is an excellent choice to have."
1,"Great on features, Terrible on work","What an extremely disappointing device. The drill works well, the sander works great, the saw is fast -- But......with a freshly-charged (4-hours) battery, all I was able to do was screw 3 screws, saw a 1x3 pine board in half (3 inches), drill 4 5/16"" holes, and could not finish sanding one side of the 1x3x12 INCH pine board.Total run time somewhere around 5-7 minutes!!!!!There is no way that you could consider using this tool on anything but the most elementary of touch-up projects.This tool is a joke, only for [high cost] I am not laughing."
3,"Pretty, but pretty unnecessary","A decent ep introducing the uninitiated into The Album Leaf's mellow and melodic world of guitar-driven instrumentals. Most of these five tracks do not particularly stand out, offering instead an accessible overview of the Triztesa frontman's dreamy and slightly challenging musical world."
2,"OK, but not as elegant as I'd hoped.","The band looks a bit plastic - like and the face is rather plain stainless steel. Sturdy, basic watch and works fine, but spend a little more if you're looking for classic, simple elegance, something more upscale."
5,What the Englishman says plus ...,.. saw THE CAT (from Joy house) live at a Schifrin concert in the Philamonic in Cologne. Took the roof off! This album is one of my 'most-played'.
4,Pretty good phone if I can say myself,"This is an excellent Cellphone/walkmanIf you're looking for look, don't look any further. If you like technology, with good functionality and an excellent walkman then this is it.Pros:*Has pretty much everything you can possibly (Bluetooth 2.0, 2mp camera, Infrared port,back light, video calling,usb connection)*Great screen with an outstanding resolutionCons:*At the beginning you can sometimes press the walkman button by mistake, but after a while you get used to it.*If you want to press the power button sometimes you may slide the phone down by mistake since the slider doesn't present much resistance.This is a great cell phone with a lot of good features, but its a little too wide for my taste. If you can look past those little design mistakes, then you'll have a cellphone in your hands."
4,Tastes like greens suppose to taste...,"I like it, but i don't see any energy levels goes up after i drink it. I don't get enought veggies, so must supplement with this extra green powder.!I can't drink it with water, only with organic unprocessed apple juice, because its clear and tastes pleasant, otherwise it tastes awful, but its good for you :) CHEERS !"
1,Nothing New,"This is that kind of books where you will find the same things you can find in a lot of painting books. How to mix the colours, the paper categories. I thin is a waste of time, and of course of money."
3,Season 4? I Think Not!,"I see that some of us have noticed that this is not really the complete fourth season but is infact only fourteen episodes out of twenty six. There is another episode missing by the way, it's the Halloween episode ""All Hallow's Thieves"" which is supposed to be the second episode on disk one. Counting the ten episodes that come before these, ""All Hallow's Thieves"" and ""The Ninja Tribunal"" this set is missing twelve episodes all together. As far as I'm concerned this set is a rip off and I sincerely hope Funimation will re-release season four correctly (ie Season 4 Part 1 of 2 and Season 4 Part 2 of 2)later on down the line or I'll give them a drop kick they'll never forget. This is why I only gave it three stars, good show but lousy compilation for this DVD set. All in all you're better off waiting a little while to see if it gets a proper release."
3,Not the entire season...,"This is kinda deceptive... This is not the entire season, only part of it. It's just 14 random episodes out of the 26 episode season. Good show, but this product is deceiving... Not the whole season. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
3,Season 4,"Good quality video but it miss about the 10 firsts episodes of the season 4. I don't know why, I have search a little on internet and it's just like if they had never been put on a DVD. But there is still more then the half of the season on the DVD."
5,TMNT,This dvd box set is easily one of the best purchases I've made on Amazon.com as watching these videos brought me back to my childhood. The picture quality and sound are much better than the original VHS tapes and you can spend a whole day watching these classic episodes.
1,Very Very Traditional,"So traditional you can hear crowds in the backround, children crying and farm animals in the backround! Not what I though it would be."
2,I echo all Gheorghiu's critics,"Eileen Farrell, Renata Tebaldi, Leontyne Price, Martina Arroyo, Josephine Barstow. What do all these talented sopranos have in common? They are all true Verdian spintos. Angela Gheorghiu does not belong in their exalted company. She may be, one day in the far future, an equal to Renata Scotto and Mirella Freni, but definitely not equal to the aforementioned Verdians. She has a light lyric soprano that is pleasant to listen to, but she does not have a spinto voice. She perhaps could pull off Gilda and Desdemona in the opera house. However, she should not under any circumstances tackle Elisabetta, the two Leonoras (one of which she has already sung), Ada, Amelia, and Elvira. Gheorghiu is a lovely singer of light Puccini roles and French lyric ones. She should stick to that repertory."
3,A style to question,"As an incident described in Cecilia Bartoli's biography ""Cinderella and company"" suggests, Georghiu and her husband want to clear the cobwebs off Italian opera. They want to take away all the 1950s glitter from the sound and just have something fresh and clean. As much as I promote the discovery of new ways to express things musically in the 21st century, I have not gotten used to Georghiu's approach. This CD goes in a different direction than the seasoned opera listener expects it to. Chailly provides a clean accompaniment, even if the orchestra is not the Vienna Philharmonic or the London Symphony. This is not the definitive Verdi collection, but keep an eye on Angela Georghiu."
1,One of the worst Verdi recitals in history!!!,"Angela Gheorghiu has a small voice. She should not be tackling these great spinto arias that Verdi wrote. Her voice is just too small and weak. Her ""Pace, pace mio Dio"" is underweight vocally. There was some digital fakery going on in ""O patria mia"". Shame on this Rumanian whoreslatch for resorting to studio tricks in order to ""sing"" the high C. This guttersnipe singing Verdi spinto arias is like Maria Callas trying to act funny or Rita Streich singing Brünnhilde's Immolation Scene from ""Die Götterdämmerung"". It's like Callas trying to get through the Mad Scene cadenza from ""Lucia di Lammermoor"" without expiring or at least, embarrassing herself."
1,Why???,"Why does Gheorghiu try to sing something that obviously she can't sing? I think she tried to approach to these new rols on her way, but with the worst results.Her Gilda sounds as she was married with children and a dog. What kind of Gilda is that?. Of course a fantasy (almost a nightmare).FOr instance, I think the way how she approached to the Leonoras and Aida, it's good.I like Gheorghiu's voice, but it looks as her worst enemy has choosen her repertoire for this CD. The same thing happens with her new CD. Again, her enemy told her she is able to sing colarotura repertoire."
3,Every soprano wants to sing Verdi,"Ms. Gheorgiu has a beautiful lyric voice which exhibits great technique and is pleasant to listen when used effectively. Some of the selections in this cd are not suited to her voice, however. She is not a dramatic soprano and her interpretation of some of the Verdi arias shows it. Her interpretation sounds too studied and detached, almost clinical."
3,Non-stick coating completely breaks down,"I'm very satisfied with the pot's functionality. No complaints about how it works. My only problem is the eventual breakdown and leaching of the non-stick coating on the hot plate into my water. After much use, mineral deposits start to develop in the pot, especially on the hot plate. These deposits and routine cleaning (along with normal upward pressure from the boiling water) have caused the coating to flake and more-or-less disintegrate. I am not a fanatic about Teflon-like coatings, but I do not find this acceptable. I did some research and found that the coating is supposed to be non-toxic and pass harmlessly through the digestive tract. I still am not thrilled about ingesting the particles, which seems unavoidable using this brand. I do not know what the other brands feature, but in your search for hot pots you might want to take this into consideration. I purchased my pot in February and used it regularly for tea and coffee."
4,"Boils water quick, no other frills.","This little Hot Pot definitely does what it says on the tin, and little else. It boils water in a snap, making me cup of French Press coffee very quickly in the morning. As for safety features, there really are none. It's definitely a single use appliance, but it's easy to use and gets the job done. I've had mine for a few years and I'm upgrading so I can get a cordless model. After having this in my home for a while, I can't imagine NOT having an electric kettle at my fingertips. Definitely MUCH faster than boiling water on the stove, and it allows me to keep all of my burners free if I'm cooking at the same time. Four stars for lack of safety features, although I've never had a problem with safety."
2,big dissappointment!,"This hot pot does not make water taste like plastic, but it does leak! after only a few weeks of use (in an office setting) it started to leak between the pitcher and the heating element. Now it pours water all over the place. I would save yourself the trouble and opt for a better, possible metal option. It only got 2 *s because when it worked, it worked well."
2,"No On/Off switch, no automatic Shut Off","It is a poore design, boils water fast, but not safe, you have do not forget to unplug it every time you use it."
3,Good value for money but mind the gap!,"I purchased this product in the mistaken belief that it was a kettle; i.e. that it boils water and then turns off. It doesn't. It boils water, and any other liquid one cares to put in it, but then maintains the temperature at a given level.To that extent the product is very good value for money.It has no visible heating elements so scale is not a problem and it looks nice. As a hot pot, the only drawback I can find is that a gap develops between the back of the lid and the handle when pouring liquid. This, of course, means that steam can escape and provide a nasty shock by scalding one's hand; nothing fatal, just a little annoying. The other annoyance is that there is no ""Off"" switch, which means that I have to take the plug out when I have finished using it. However, for [the price] I can't really complain too much."
4,Takes a beating,"I have been using this product several times a day- almost daily- for extended periods of time and it has worked like a champ. The only reasons I didn't give it five stars is because: 1. The spout tends to dribble down the side a bit when you go to pour it out - maybe it's just me, but I don't feel I should have to experiment in finding the ""optimal pouring angle"". 2. When I go to turn the tempurature down to the off position I will not only hear a click (no problem) but will see a flash through the water container. While I have been hit by house current before (and worse) I really don't consider it a hobby so this has me a little anxious. Maybe some other user can provide information to see if this is common with this unit or not."
2,Not very safe!,"This hot pot was the only (!!!) kind of electric tea kettle available anywhere locally (checked WalMart, KMart, Big Lots, Hall's Hardware, and the grocery stores).What I strongly dislike about the pot is the fact that it doesn't switch off automatically once its content has reached the boiling point. It also doesn't have an off switch, so make sure you unplug it after every use!Another safety hazard is the lid: I have scalded myself several times because I hadn't put it on exactly right and hot steam was coming out of a small opening right where you put your thumb. It would be much better if this pot had a flip-top.I wish I had done some research and purchased a kettle online!"
5,A Master among Masters,"Thanks for the ""heads up"" folkie Kay. There are only 2 or 3 songs here not included on Thonon's ""Trafic d'Influences"" album, which, for what it's worth, is my personal favorite, even surpassing all of the very fine albums from Ad Vielle Que Pourra. These guys swing that traditional folk music like no one since the early Red Clay Ramblers. These 2 groups are,in my humble opinion, beyond category."
5,Nice carry straps,"These are quality carry straps for the $$$. No regrets with the purchase!Feed 'em, Bleed 'em and Eat 'em!"
5,From South Florida to Florence Italy,"I was browsing for my first time on Amazon.com and I was extremely happy to see that Gary Clark CD is now available through this great medium. Some time ago, I bought several copies of ""Simply Grand"" after a Gary Clark live performance in Boca Raton Florida. I have taken some to my hometown, Florence Italy. My family and friends here and in Florence, love artistic musical expressions of high level. Gary Clark does just that. ""Speak Softly Love"" is powerful, moving and original. It sets the tempo for superb and exquisitely arranged performance."
5,great mood music,Great songs! I put the CD in and listen to it all day long. Great dining music! Love every single song on the CD. A must buy!
1,Simply NOT grand...,"I was sold on Phillip Scott's review and thought this would be great, it's horrible, there is no jazz content here, just plain easy listening music. This is ok for elevator music or to be oplayed as background ,usic in shopping ceners, but not much else is going on here. The only reason I'm writing this review is so the next person like me(a true jazz fan), won't get burnt. I'm stuck with this and two other of his cd's becasue nobody else was brave enough to tell it like it is. Gary's an easy listening pianist just like Davis Osborne, in the liberace tradition... If you like over the top liberace style paino go for it, if you think Kenny G is jazz, fo for it, if you have muscial integrity and like sophistocated jazz with touches of improviation or creativity stay the heck away from this cd or any of Gary's cd's, your lookin' in the wrong palce. Sorry Phillip I disagree with you very strongly, now I understand what kind of musical level you are on."
2,Better then aromatherepy???,"I don't know abaout that I love my aromatherepy, of course I only take a bubble bath with scented candles while listening to Enya, after I've gone to see my psychic advisor and looked onto my chrystal ball. Voodoo hooddooo mumbo jumbo....Actually that was all just a joke, aromatherepy is for loosers and so is this music..."
5,This gift was a hit!,My daughter was thrilled with this gift and I was thrilled that it got to me in time for Christmas. Good service!
4,Love The Mentalist,"I love this show, so this review is bound to be biased. It's a good ensemble-type show. I like the secondary characters as well as the mains. The dialogue is well written, and supports development of and interaction between characters. It's very light on forensic information, but there are plenty of shows that cover the bases on the science of crime-solving. The Mentalist sports a more unique method of figuring out who done it. That plus the perfect blend of drama, suspense, plenty of humour, good writing and wonderful acting makes The Mentalist one of the best shows on television."
5,The Mentalist:The Complete Second Season,I have the first and second season's of the Mentalist and can hardly wait for the third season to come out. I keep watching on Amazon so I can preorder the third season. Wonderful show!
2,Solo la he visto en la TV,"La compré en pre-order, pero no ha salido, ni me ha llegado.La compré porque lo que vi en la tv me llamó la atención."
5,Awesome!,My granddaughters are huge fans of the Mentalist so this was a big hit with them as a Christmas gift!
1,Awful,I do not mind some of Iil Jon's songs but this one is awful. And that album cover? Are you kidding me? Watch me burn a black pride flag and the NAACP would be all over me. You burn a confederate flag and its cool? A lot of people died for that flag for reasons ignorant idiots like Lil Jon and the East Side Boyz would never understand. What a scumbag. Have some respect for other cultures and do some research before you go burning flags.
1,Here comes the black plague for hip hop!,"This is to lil jon, Crunk does not fit into any genre of music period! Please stop bitting off hip hop,to pass off your crap! How can people call it talent when you yell out a few phrases:What,Yeah,Okay,etc....?Lets not go there about the meaning or the message behind his crap.The beats are plain and annoying.Thanks to this buffoon,whose not that important anymore in the year 2009,we have retards doing the same crap that he started.LOL... Kinda sad,that lil jon thought Dave Chappelle was making a friendly joke about him in actuality, Dave was making fun of him of how much of a dumbass he is.P.S Don't support this scumbag called Lil Jon!"
1,WTF?,"I cannot explain how appalled I was while listening to this dribble. This is quite possibly the worst album I have heard in a long time. It is basically a little over an hour of screaming about absolutely nothing. The fact that all these no-talent fools do is yell out nonsense lyrics ON EVERY SINGLE SONG not only make this group atrocious but annoying. They would actually have to make improvements for me to call them amatuerish. The irony is with all the head-splitting yelling, you are actually bored to death because all they do is repeat themselves and seemingly say any explicit random thought that comes to mind. Please do not buy this album, so hopefully these idiots go away sooner than later."
1,Mindless garbage.,"I first heard of these annoying, no-talent posers about a year or so ago when lots of complete idiots kept on saying ""Bia, Bia!"" over and over again as if it was actually cool to say something as idiotic as that. It makes me wonder if they actually realize how stupid they sound?I know this really doesn't have anything to do with this album whatsoever, but why does it look like the guy is taking a big fat crap on the cover of this album? Could it be that he's really hinting to us that this album is nothing more than crap? Interesting..."
2,Annoying as [heck] !!!,"Plain and simple, this album [stinks]. I admit the beats was o.k, he wasn't.Every song he said the same thing. It was very annoying. He kept on yellin, thats not how you are supposed to rap. matter of fact he wasn't even rapping at all."
4,Great,"This is a pretty good rap cd. Most of the songs are good, but some are bad. Anyone who enjoys listening to rap should go and buy this, you most likely will not be dissapointed, I wasn't."
4,Blackberry Knows Best,"Lil Jon and the Eastside Boyz new cd is off-the-chain!My Favorite sond is,Nothins Free along with others.Iread some of your comments and alot of you made someOff-the-Topic comments.Whether you know it or not theyare representing their true color.You might think differentjust b\c you represent different,but that don't give someof you the right to call their music a piece of junk."
1,Racist Garbage.,"Yet another in the long line of racist hip hop artists who's racism is ignored by the music media.If a country band were to make a CD cover that disrespected black culture the way they disrespect ours on this one it would be all over MTV, VH1, Rolling Stone Exc. Exc. People are being killed ...Murdered by thug criminals simply for displaying a symbol of their culture (a confederate flag)and bands like LiL Jon only encourage this."
1,awful,"i am a fan of hip hop. this is not hip hop. this is just a buncha garbage that could've been though up by anyone. not only does it sound terrible, but its the least origional thing ive ever heard and has no talent whatsoever put into it. making music is a great thing. this is an abuse o that art. i have no bias against dirty south hip hop...although im into east coast mostly, but this is trash, and they add onto it by waving around the confederate flag. where is this going and why"
1,You eatin off hip hop and I hope you choke onthe gimmick!!!!!!!!,"When are we gonna start boycotting this bubble gum pop bull S%%T! Lil john is one of the worst emtertainers on this earth. His flow is rough and terrible and he wastes beats on a regular basis. I guess all of the zombies and sheep won't appreciate me dissing this retarded muppet but someone has to stand up and say something. This album is a just like a vicious string of herpes infecting the youth of many nations. We need some hip hop penicillin like KRS ONE, Mos Def, and kweli"
4,Definitely Crunked Up,"This album is definitely crunked up as lil john and his boys bring some tight beats. The first four tracks on the cd really got me going. lil john's lyrics are no better than average, though, but the beats will get u hyped up. guest appearances by too short, eightball, 3-six mafia, and ludacris add in much needed lyrical support."
1,How can people listen to this garbage?,"I do like hip hop, but this stuff is just beyond atrocious. I am a fan of underground hip hop, and I can now see why I quit listening to mainstream rap. This crap is just...ugh, it's WAAAAAAAY too repetitive, absolutely nothing lyrically, and the beats are just, oh my god lol, this is the lamest music I've heard in a long time. Lil' Jon is an absolute disgrace to the hip hop world."
4,Nice for a 4 1/2 Great disc,"This is my Favorite Lil Jon CD of the 3 that I have heard. There are some nice songs on here. They are more roudy then they are dancing to but they have nice beats. I remember when ""Bia Bia"" came out in December 2000 and stayed around until April of 2002. The First single was ""I like dem Girlz"" which was Lil Jon's ode to big ole butts.Better then his new albums because they do not have the same F*** you attitude."
1,not for sensitive ears,i dont know about all of you but i have very delicate ears and i was listening to the radio when lil john and his downsouth east side boys came on. the base was so loud it shook me out of my seat and almost gave me a heart attack! this is way too loud people. lil john should think about the people with sensitive ears and not just about himself all the time.also it appears to me that lil john is promoting hate crimes to young children by looking at his album cover. i do not think this is a very good idea for him to be doing.i heard lil john has a song called put yo hood up. well i agree he should put his hood up because he should be ashamed of all the hate crimes and damage to peoples ears he has caused.
2,Broken After One Month of Use,"I bought this gift for my parents, and they absolutely loved it until it broke after a month of use. They used it to massage their feet every night before going to bed, so there wasn't excessive or abusive use. Consider your options before purchasing this massager."
1,It was great then nothing,This product worked great @ first. Then just stopped. 30 day refund policy. errrIt worked so good I ordered another one for my mother. Expensive and defective.
2,There are better ways to waste money,"If you want to blow off few hundered dollars on a product that you won't use after few days, this is it. It joins a long list of disappointing products I have bought and never used after few times.This vibrator is harsh on your feet and creates lot of frictional heat and irritation on the foot. I tried rubbing vegetable oil on my feet before using this product. That helped little.But, after using this few times I didn't see any worthwhile benefit. Now it is gathering dust in my garage along with my stationary bike."
1,do not buy this,"this an awful appliance. water drips during the steam mode, the device won't shut off unless you unplug it or wait one hour for ""auto-off"". the resevoir has a tedious cap that can only be filled when the iron is around an 87 degree angle, not quite horizonal. the grip is too small for larger hands, and it drags across clothes like a 2x4."
4,I liked this iron but --,"I got almost four years of good use from this iron before it died. I'm a quilter, and the iron was used for a couple hours almost every day. No problems with drips. My only quibble was that you have to unplug it to turn it off. I need a new one and can't decide whether to get another one of these or not."
1,terrible,My iron also drips water out of the bottom and soaks my clothes before I can even get them ironed. I am highly irritated that I spent extra money for a product that claims to be wonderful and actually sucks.
1,Save your money,"Save your money, this iron isn't worth it. It leaks, it doesn't get hot enough, and it gets out wrinkles about as efficiently as a hairdryer would. It worked marginally well for just under a year, then it completely died. I don't even need to turn it on for water to leak out when I fill it up. If I turn the steam on I have a lake on my ironing board within 5 seconds."
1,Totally worthless iron,"The only wonderful thing about this iron is its light weight...the main reason I bought it. It drowns your clothes and the ironing board. You cannot wear the clothes after steaming. DO NOT, DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT buy this so-called iron! It doesn't deserve even one star, but rating system forces it."
5,Best iron for the price,"Having used many models of steam irons over the last 60 years, I found that this model was very good. The Stainless Steel plate is far better that the coated model over the long haul, as the coating will wear away in time, at least in my own experience. The price was light as was the steam iron. A pleasure in both instances."
5,Swiss Diamond Pan Cover,"I bought an 11-inch Swiss Diamond fry pan at a local ""gourmet"" store that claimed it didn't come with a lid. And that they had none available that fit it. This seemed strange so I was delighted I could locate the lid through Amazon. My order was fulfilled promptly and the lid fits perfectly."
5,Nice Lid,"My brother ordered the Swiss Diamond Skillet for my birthday a few years ago, but didn't get me the lid. So I ordered this lid and it fit perfectly, and is nicely constructed. It's nice to be able to see thru it when cooking also! I would recommend it if you have the Swiss Diamond skillet that it fits. I actually have a Circulon wok/skillet that it fits too, so it does double duty. I love it!"
3,"Good, but hops about too much for me","This tape does a very nice job of showing some background information on Caesar and the battle tactics of Alesia, but disappointed me by not presenting the material in chronological order. It skips from modern Alesia back to battle tactics to Caesar's growth as a commander, to the Gallic Wars and back. My students found it unfocused and a bit difficult to follow and to stay engaged in."
2,The worst customer service!,"I realize that nothing is perfect. For $60 I don't expect RTX to be an Industrial tool. I did however expected it to work longer than 15 minutes! After the second use, the chuck lock failed and I had to use a small screw driver to unlock the chuck. After the 5th use, the speed controller failed. It started to hiccup while working. The sixth time I went to use the tool, it seized and smoke came out of it! Total life of this unit was about 15 minutes. I bought it more than 60 days ago so the retailer will not exchange it. I have written to Black and Decker through their web site several times. I have not heard anything from them. I realize, I may have a lemon. Not having any information from the manufacturer is the worst part. I am buying a second one now. This time I am going with Dremel. Lemon or no lemon, I am very dissatisfied with the customer service at Black and Decker."
4,Works Great until you need a new chuck,"My B&D has performed flawlessly for a couple of years. I have used it to cut all kinds of stuff. My only problem is when trying to get a new chuck. Mine is worn out on the inside and it is difficult to tighten. All the dealers I've been to, even those who sell B&D tools, only sell Dremel accessories. For most accessories this works fine, but the Dremel chucks are threaded differently than B&D and they are NOT interchangeable. For that reason alone I would not get a B&D."
1,Get a Dremmel instead!,"Plugged it in...it died after 30 seconds. I sent it back and got a Dremmel instead...much, much better!"
4,SFBA's other serial killer.,"No surpise that Graysmith's sophomore true crime book (his first being Zodiac) would be about the Trailside Killer. I remember his rampage well, having spent my entire life in the San Francisco Bay Area. Although not quite as well written, it still is a fascinating look at San Francisco's ""other"" serial killer."
4,great for the price,"I bought this juicer after reading all the reviews because it looked like a good product for the money. It's quite, easy to clean and does the job. But I figure if I'm going to be doing this for awhile I wanted something that gets more of the juice out of your produce, because it does leave a lot in the pulp. I've bought another juicer but I'm sure my son-in-law will love this one because it's free!"
3,Slightly Messy,"Well, either 2 or 3 stars. Toss up.I bought this to help juice fruit for jelly-making, so I am not juicing just one glass or two to drink, but quite a bit.I don't mind juicing in batches (like one runs a food processor) and I will continue to use this machine from time to time, but boy, even with doing only a little bit of fruit at a time and then rinsing it out repeatedly, it still makes a mess inside the outer housing. Too bad.For the price, I guess it's OK, but I would not suggest that a friend purchase it, even for drinking-juicing."
2,Great Until It Stopped Working,"I purchased this product about 1 year ago. I did not juice every day and sometimes I did not juice for a few months. I made a cup of a juice about 1 week ago and the juicer seemed to not want to start. I checked to make sure that I had all the parts in place and tried again. This time it did start. I tried it this morning and it won't start at all. I am sure it is the juicer because I have tried different outlets and taken it apart and put it back together multiple times. :( Up until now I thought this was a great juicer @ a great price. However, now that it has stopped working after almost one year of on again off again juicing seems like a short lifespan for a $40-50 juicer."
2,So Difficult to use,"cons :I spend a lot of time trying to get the pieces to lock so I can use it. it's ALWAYS a fight.the leftover pulp is soaking wet = wasteful.there is a lot of juice left over in the machinethe feed hole is pretty smallmessy/awkward to get pulp out of pulp collectorlots of difficult cleanup = time consuming.The electric cord is on one side of the machine -- always the opposite side of where my electric socket is.pros:makes nice juiceinexpensivefastnoise level is tolerableI get the grater basket clean pretty easily with a dishwashing brush. But cleanup is pretty awful especially with soaking wet pulp and all the juice left in the basket. No such thing as a quick juicing before work -- you'll be spending 10 mins trying to get it to lock in place then 20 mins trying to clean up.overall, I find this machine difficult to work with. I am so tired of fighting with it."
1,Not a good Juicer-----,I have been juicing for a very long time. Our old Juiceman finally is not wroking properly after about 15 years- however the juice from that is still way more dry than the one from this juicer. The liquid pours out the top and when you pull the plunger back to put in new fruits and its sprays juice everywhere. The pulp catcher is way to small and the strainer gets clogged very easily. Its a disaster. I used it twice and boxed it back up for return. It is made out of very cheap flimsy plastic. If you are looking for a sturdy juicer to use for years if you are a serious juicer- this is NOT it.
2,Very Inefficent,"Received this item and put it through some trial runs - apples, grapes, mangoes, strawberries, and blueberries. On all items, there was a large waste of juice. It did virtually nothing to the mango, and left large unprocessed chunks on the others. Other reviews talked about wet pulp, but I thought it would be minor. I would say 10-15% of the juice remained in pulp in most cases, and 90% with the mango. Like I said, a lot of large chunks of fruit were in the pulp bin unprocessed. Based on other reviews, we thought this might be adequate for our use, and the low price helped. However, the waste will far outweigh the low cost. We are returning this juicer and will upgrade."
4,"Easy to Use, Quick Clean-Up, Good Looks & Solid Construction","Since purchasing this extractor 6 weeks ago, I have used this on a daily basis. Ease of clean-up was critical in the selection process and I haven't been disappointed. Aesthetically, this machine looks nice on the kitchen counter and the stainless steel cup eliminates any worries about ending up with yellowed, stained plastic parts.If you're interested in making primarily OJ, this may not be the right juicer for you, though. If you're juicing strictly oranges, you'll have to empty out the pulp basket after 2 oranges. Any more than two and this is the one scenario that will make this juicer leak. I have found that by alternating oranges with apples or carrots, I can juice 6+ oranges in one session.Fortunately, our local discount club started selling these for 1/2 of retail so I got a great deal. Regardless, this would have been an excellent purchase."
5,Like This Juicer,I was pleased with this juicer. It is smart looking with the stainless steel and juices won't stain it. Easy to use but by far the huge plus is it is easy to clean. It actually took less than five minutes to clean. Does a good job extracting the juice. I recommend it.
1,Poor extraction of Juice...lots of pulp,"Bought the Jex328 Waring Pro. This machine works well except that the juice is full of pulp. I have to use a strainer to remove the excess pulp before I can enjoy the juice. I am now looking for another juicer...and as this is the first time I am using a Waring, should I stick with the brand or search somewhere else."
3,"OK, if you don't juice greens","This is my first juicer, and it generally does OK with larger fruits and vegetables such as apples, carrots, beets, etc. But when it comes to juicing greens, all you'll get from 2 cups of spinach is a few drops of juice. It seems to leave an awful lot of pulp behind in general. To be clear, I am not the kind of person who expects a $50 product to do the work of a $150 item, so I'm not complaining too much; if I had to do it all over again, though, I would simply pony up the dough for a more expensive, better juicer. On the plus side, it is pretty quiet and easy to clean. Bottom line is if you can afford it, buy something more powerful that'll leave less pulp behind and yield more juice."
2,"Nice looking, Inefficient","I've had many juice extractors before and this one defenitely looks better than most of them and is reasonably priced. Unfortunately it is an extremely, i mean extremely inefficient machine. The pulp it leaves is not just wet, it is soaking with juice. Even lightly squeezing that pulp with hand produces a lot of juice, which this machine could not collect. It is no wonder it happens though, just take a look at the extractor mechanism and the first think that comes to mind is ""hm, this must miss a lot of juice"" and indeed it does. I would return it if I could and get a better machine, as I am paying almost twise as much for produce for the same amount of juice. The only question I have is who writes all those reports praising how good a machine this is, probably Warring itself.Do not buy this machine, look for something else, you can hardly do worse."
4,Great juicer for the price,"Pros: Easy and fast to cleanNo stains - steel cupLooks nice on counter and doesn't take up alot of spaceDon't have to cut up carrots in small piecesDoesn't take long to make a cup of juiceCons: Get a larger brush to clean the strainerI've had juice man juicer and it was so hard to clean and the plastic would stain, so I never wanted to keep it out on the counter because it looked stained.This juicer has a 400watt motor. I'm usually in a hurry in the morning. So I don't want to spend hours cutting and cleaning a juicer, yet I like to have fresh juice every morning. I'm happy with juicer for the great price."
3,Watch out.. not a citrus juicer!,"First of all, let me say that what it does juice, it does well. But I couldn't find any obvious indicators that this juicer was not designed to juice citrus products until I got the 4th page of the manual.I decided to keep it and use it anyway and it does work on citrus if you peel it, but it's pretty frothy. Apple juice however is done to perfection!Overall, nice looking, powerful model that is running a little bit of false advertising in my opinion."
2,Jammin' Juice from a Leaky Loser,"I bought my boyfriend this juicer and he rushed to the grocery store to buy fresh fruits. We bought some very yummy oranges and okay apples from Fairway. Very excited to make this juice. We had to spend a bit of time chopping the fruits to fit into the narrow shute. The machine itself was very easy to use. Just put in the fruit and turn the motor on. However, as it was making juice, it splattered all over the place and drips of juice began to leak out of the seam of the front panel. We took the machine apart to make sure we assembled it correctly -- we had. The design is severely flawed. Quite disappointed. Now we're on line checking out other brands.... However messy this rumbling machine, the juice, as mentioned above, was JAMMIN'!"
4,Good juicer for great price,I read other reviews and agree with them for the most part. It was also my first juicer so I didn't want to spend a whole lot until I could see that I would use one regularly. Turns out that I use it pretty much every day. It does leave a few chunks but not so much that I feel wasteful. It only takes a few minutes to clean. I am very happy with this product.
3,an ok juicer,"There is a lot of juice left in the pulp collector. I feel that we are wasting money on veges and fruits because we are not getting the most juice out of them and having to use more than is needed to get a full glass of juice. Overall, this juicer is great for the occasional juicing but for everyday juicing we plan on purchasing a better juicer."
2,It works but not well.,We purchased this juicer about 5 years ago; we had it about two years before it killed over. It does work and the price is affordable but you get what you pay for as the more often true than not saying goes. It is quite loud and you do not get much juice from it. Cleaning it was OK. We have upgraded to the Breville BJE200XL.
1,Get an older model...,I really can't understand why usually newer products aren't as good as older ones.What's wrong with the older design of an aextractor that will eject the pulp to a removable container?Why do I have to open the unit and take it apart just to clear the pulp?Buttom line: If you plan to juice more than a few carrots for you morning juice - forget about this usit.
2,Looks nice but very messy!,"Just bought this juicer at the local Lowes. After one use, it's going back.It's a nice looking unit, but out of the juicers I've tried it is one of the messiest.The lid doesn't seal well and pulp ends up getting on everything within a 3 foot radius of where you are working.There is also no dedicated pulp ""bin"" like some other units. The pulp just ends up in the area around the juicing screen. This is fine, but there are a lot of little nooks and cranies to clean here. Also, the pulp builds up very quickly.I juiced half a pineapple, one apple, and 3 oranges. I got about 20oz or so of juice. After this, the unit was packed full of pulp and required cleaning.I would not recommend this unit at all for folks without a garbage disposal (it's the only way to get it clean)."
1,One of the worst,"Weak, very hard to clean and messy. Total waste of money. I own it for a couple of months and looking to replace it. The only good thing about this product is design. Is is pretty cool. If you're looking to decorate you kitchen and not going to make any juice, go ahead and buy it, otherwise pass it on."
3,Great juicer for the price,"I bought the Waring Pro Professional Juice Extractor JEX328 to use when I visit the USA. I originally wanted to buy L'Equip Mini Pulp Ejector Juicer, an excellent juicer that I use at home in the UK, but it was a bit pricey so I found a reconditioned Waring at a very good price on the internet. (approx. $25).Pros: Sturdy / easy to use / comes with spout cleaner and its own jug which the L'Equip does notCons: Bit noisy / quite large and cumbersome / takes longer to clean than the L'Equip / lower yield than the L'Equip and some chunks of fruit and vegetables found in waste basket / pusher tends to stick sometimesAlthough I definitely notice a difference between the two machines, I enjoy using the Waring, and consider it a very good juicer for the price I paid."
1,Waste of Money- Waring Pro Juicer JEX328,This Waring Pro JEX328 is IMO a waste of money. As I should have remembered you get what you pay for. There's still lots of juice left in with the pulp and large pieces of whatever it is you are juicing .... in the pulp container. It's in my Goodwill box right now though I shouldn't wish it on anyone else.
2,Inefficient,"I bought this item because of the price and high ratings it received on Amazon. When I got it though, I used it and realized that it was leaving behind a LOT of pulp that was still VERY juicy. My final verdict is that I should have shelled out the extra $$ up front because in the long run, it'll cost me in wasted fruit.Overall I'm disappointed."
2,Too weak. Have to cut up fruits and vegies real small,"This juicer is very disappointing. The feed chute is very narrow so I had to cut up my fruits and vegetables real small. I had to use a lot of muscle just to push a carrot down the chute. I hardly got any juice out of my carrots. I had a breville juicer that I gave away to my sister that didn't require too much pushing, plus it squeezed out a lot more juice. This juicer also leaves big junks of fruits in the pulp container, and the pulp is very wet. Not an efficient juicer at all. I gave it 2 stars intead of 0 or 1 because it's not very noisy, plus it does work, if you're willing to spend lots of preparation time to chop up the fruits, or use some muscles to push down the chute, and waste a lot of good juice. I'll be going through the trouble of returning it."
3,Looks better than it performs,"This looks like a higher end unit, with its metal base and stainless shell and cup, but as they say, beauty is skin deep.I use this primarily for making carrot juice. Performance-wise the pulp receptacle fills quickly and is rather soggy due to the mediocre extraction efficiency. It is certainly better than some of the lower end units on the market but not worth the $79 price here. You can find it at Costco for $49.Happy juicing"
1,Looks great . . . but isn't.,"I got sucked into buying this by its appearance of ""industrial strength."" It has been a big, big disappointment. Cleaning is easy on the non-rotating parts--just rinse them right after using. The mesh rotating thing is an entirely different matter. It's an absolute b*tch to get it clean, even right after juicing. Waring supplies a cleaning brush (another reason I bought this machine), but it is a joke. It's useless, repeat, USELESS, for cleaning the mesh. The only worthwhile thing about this juicer(?) is the stainless steel cup that comes with it, and that's not worth what the juicer costs.It's junk. Don't waste your money. Spend more and get better."
1,Not a good juicer!,I bought this juicer a couple of a years ago and it wasn't good at all. It wouldn't juice anything correctly. I gave it away and didn't buy one for a while. So recently I just bought the Breville BJE200XL 700-Watt Compact Juice Fountain and it's AMAZING!!!!! Now this is what I call a juicer at an affordable price. It juices perfectly! I've had it for 3 days now and used it a couple of times and it's amazing. I don't recommend the Waring JEX328 at all.
2,Messy and wasteful,Easier and healthier to eat a fresh apple or carrot. Purchased theWaring JEX328 Health Juice Extractorjuicer after researching for best operation at a moderate cost. Tried a variety of fruits and vegetables and wound up with a fraction of juice and a ton of pulp. The lid is tricky to use and the juicer itself is very loud. Save your $$ and stick to fresh fruits and veggies instead.
3,First Juicer,"This was my first Juicer, so I have nothing to compare it to, however prepare to spend a fair amount of time cleaning it after each use (you need a brush)"
3,"Yes, it leaves a lot of left over veggies/fruit skin+","I've had this for quite sometime now... Very true what other reviewers have mentioned good machine but not great. Leaves a lot of extract (hence, ""extractor"")from the fruits/vegetables and does leave the juice froth like, at times. I will get a juicer which blends and liquifies all the fruit/veg. so NOTHING is wasted... when funds become available. :)Happy juicing!"
5,Waring Juicer,"Excellent product ... this is my 2nd (I wore the 1st one out after 5 years). Gets daily use(3 or 4x per day), is somewhat of a hassle to clean but worth the effort."
1,"Too light, overheats","I was hoping to use this juicer for making apple cider. The results are disapointing as the juice is sludgy, the pulp is wet, and you can only get about a pint out of it before it gets too hot. I estimate that I only got about half as much juice as I would have with a real cider press."
1,Broke the first day!,"The first day I put the brand new juicer together it broke! It started leaking all over the place, the plastic broke off, and it's junk!"
4,Excellent for the price!,"I bought this juicer, after reading other reviews knowing that you get what you pay for and expecting a so-so juicer. I used it for the first time last night. I did an apple, pear and carrot combo. The juicer would be 5 stars except that it is pretty loud. I got a very good juice yield from the fruit, and did not have any issue with leaking. It was very easy to clean and all the removable parts can go in the dishwasher if you like (I prefer just hot water and soap). I plan to use this daily, and hope it is just as good 6 months from now. If I have any complaints about the machine I will write another review but so far I am very happy with it. I should also mention it is a perfect size to keep on my counter top (not huge like other machines) and the rubber feet on the bottom are effective at keeping it from moving."
4,"Functional juicer, good price.","This juicer served me well. Cleaning was easier than it has been with some other juicers I've tried. However, really try to follow the cleaning instructions. I washed it several times in the lower dishwasher shelf and it caused the sizing to change - I was no longer able to fit the pieces together. So, hand washing recommended or top shelf only. This was a great juicer! Affordable, too."
4,Good value for the price,"Recommended by a friend, this low cost juicer does an adequate job. We are first time juicers and did not want to spend a lot of money on our first machine. Tends to let pieces of some vegetables pass into the pulp container (beets, carrots) and does not thoroughly juice softer fruits (pear, kiwi). I run those through a second time. Overall, a good entry level juicer."
4,QUICK & EASY!,"This juicer is super simple to use and best of all VERY easy to clean ! We have a old champion juicer that is complicated and inconvenient for everyday juicing, but the Waring is small enough to leave out for everyday use."
3,Not as good as the juiceman,The machine is louder than I expected after reading reviews. The opening to insert fruit and vegies is not as large as I expected and have had to slice even small apples multiple times to fit. The juice basket is difficult to clean unless placed in the dishwasher which is a pain if you juice more than once a day and only run the dishwasher twice a week.
4,A Great Juicer,"I don't know what happened with some of the reviewers - every morning since my juicer arrived, I've been preparing a drink with a red beet, a green apple, four carrots and four celery sticks. The juicer handles them all happily, the pulp is quite dry, and the whole thing appears to be efficient and simple to use. I do clean the components completely after each use, but I can't see any sign of the problems some people have reported.All in all, I am very happy with this juicer."
1,PULPY AND WASTEFUL,"Motor sounds great, but juices are kinda pulpy.Plus the accumulated pulps have plenty of juice in them.The pulp should be somewhat dry with no juice comming out when squeezed, hence 1 star rating."
2,Nice looking but very inefficient!!,"I got this juicer as my wedding present back in June. I was very excited to use it. However, it did not meet my expectations at all. It leaves pulp with lots of juice still in it. I tried carrots and celery sticks. This Waring juicer leaves some chunks of my veggies. What a waste! I planned to use it on the daily basis, but it is a pain to clean. Yes, the parts do come out easily, but the cleaning is a big mess. It takes me a long time to clean after each juicing session, especially the mesh. Juicing is healthy, but I would recommend another machine."
4,"Not the best,but-----------------!","When I purchased the, WARING JUICER EXTRACTOR, for my wife, I was relying totally on all the reviews that I could find. She tried the unit and was impressed. My job was to clean it and I was impressed on how easy it was to clean. The April issue ""RACHAEL RAY"" ranked her top 5 JUICERS, WARING was #3. My wife saw this and just said,""You did good""! We know that there are other Juicers that might be better but,for the price it's great."
3,"not bad, but not very good.","For what it costs, this isn't terrible, but it is VERY noisy, and the pulp still has plenty juice remaining. Cleanup isn't very difficult, except for the filter mesh."
5,Waring Health Juice Extractor,"Excellent Product!!! Priced well below most others. Love the brushed-chrome/black finish. Easy to operate, easy to care/clean up. Had a Juiceman/Jr. for number of years - it was hard to clean and did not have the larger capacity that the waring does for fruits/veggies. Also, did not have the motor power this waring has. Not to mention this is much less in price. OVERALL AWESOME PRODUCT!!! Gave one as present to friend - and my sister just bought one -"
4,Good Reliable Juicer/Extractor,"This is the first time I've ever used a juicer/extractor. Using it primarily as a juice extractor. Handles apples, grapes, tangerines, oranges, pineapple well. Love the idea of enjoying REAL fruit juice without additives & preservatives. This is what REAL fruit juice looks like. You'll be surprised the difference in taste between extracted apple juice and the stuff they sell at stores (very, very different). It does take A LOT of fruit to make not even 32 ounces of juice. I watched a few YouTube videos on juicing and learned a lot. It's fun to experiment with the fruit combinations. And then I collect the fruit waste and give it to my outdoor tortoise. Nothing is wasted :-) This is a good juicer/extractor. And the price is right."
2,Juices great....cleans awful.,"This was a great high speed juicer. But, Its a bear to clean. I see that someone said with the right brush you could clean out the stainless steel film in a minute...I apparently never found the right brush. After I used this for about 3 months I gave it away due to how hard it is to clean. Do yourself a favour and get a Breven or a Champion."
3,Great juicer for the price,"I bought the Waring Pro Professional Juice Extractor JEX328 to use when I visit the USA. I originally wanted to buy L'Equip Mini Pulp Ejector Juicer, an excellent juicer that I use at home in the UK, but it was a bit pricey so I found a reconditioned Waring at a very good price on the internet (approx. $25).Pros: sturdy / easy to use / comes with spout cleaner and its own jug which the L'Equip does notCons: Bit noisy / quite large and cumbersome / takes longer to clean than the L'Equip / lower yield than the L'Equip and some chunks of fruit and vegetables found in waste basket / pusher tends to stick sometimesAlthough I definitely notice a difference between the two machines, I enjoy using the Waring, and consider it a good juicer for the price I paid."
4,Good Juicer,This is my first juicer so was not sure what to expect. It's very easy to use and clean - and being stainless steel it looks pretty decent on the countertop so I keep it out so it's ready to go each day.
4,Great juicer for the price,"I really like this juicer, and you can't beat the price (~$52 in April 2010). It's actually a bit quieter than other juicers I've had in the past. Very easy to assemble and take apart for cleaning. The pulp collector does fill up quickly when juicing carrots, but as other reviewers have noted, it's a ten second process to clean out and you're back to juicing :) The stainless steel cup is nice and doesn't stain, but makes it difficult to measure, so I usually use a measuring cup.All in all, great juicer, I'd buy it again :)"
1,Very disappointed!,"I had this juicer for about 2 months when the ""lock"" started giving me trouble, then wouldn't lock at all. It will not work without locking. The inside is a cheap plastic, although the outer stainless steel is nice looking. The juicer did not juice well, the pulp still retained lots of juice, being very moist. Would I but this product again? Never!"
3,Price vs Reliability,"I purchased the Breville Juicer a few years ago and ended giving it to a good friend (big mistake). So the other day I dashed out and purchased this. For the money it does what it should. HOWEVER..there is aalot of foam left in the finished product and alot of wet pulp is left behind in the machine. With the Breville the pulp is very dry and there is minimal foam....and clean up is easy peasy.I plan to take it back and just purchase either another Breville or Omega as I plan to continue juicing for a more healthy lifestyle. I don't believe you have to go completely raw or vegan or even vegetarian to reap the benefits of juicing. Just cut back on the take aways and junk food and incorporate juicing and you'll be amazed at how wonderful you look and feel.It takes years off of you, inside and out."
3,My first juicer....,"I didn't want a super expensive one since I wasn't planning on being a heavy juicer [after juicing...I think I'm convinced to juice everyday!]So this was the perfect price and it seemed to have a lot of great reviews.Unfortunately...after three days of use, the amount of juice lessens and there was A LOT of juice left in the pulp catcher.I've cleaned it well so I don't know if things just get stuck or what's wrong...but if it keeps leaving a lot of juice like this, I may have to return it...or get it replaced"
3,Ok for a first juicer,"This is a decent first juicer or if you are not sure if you will continue with juicing and want to try it. There is a problem with the plunger sticking and you have to cut up larger fruits and veggies to make them fit in the chute. It is rather noisy. It does not juice berries and some veggies, such as lettuce, well. The one thing I like about it is I can clean it in about one minute and it does go in the dishwasher, except for the centrifuge basket, which needs to be scrubbed with a brush. It is also very compact, so you can travel with it easy and there are only three parts to remove."
3,Waring JEX328 Health Juice Extractor,"I have buy this and return it after 2-3 use, I would say this is a nice juicer provided you only want to make less than 30 oz of juice, if you make more than this amount the pulp become too big and you have to clean the container before you continue, If you don't, some juice will leak from the top. Secondary the size is big, look like a waste basket on your countertop. Finally I get the Braun, althought it is not as powerful but it solve the waste problem and cheaper too."
4,CarolW,"This is a fine juicer. It performs very well. Since the top pieces are removable, it makes clean up easy. I had a Champion juicer and I found it hard to clean. I read all the reviews for the Waring juicer and several of the other juicers and this one sounded like the best buy for the money. Waring made the first blender so I put my trust in the Waring name and purchased this model. So far, I am pleased with my purchase."
1,Beware!,"After 1 month of use, my juicer broke down. It simply would not start up.I took it to a Waring Pro service center, and they fixed it for free. After a couple more uses, the EXACT same thing happened AGAIN. It just wouldn't turn on any more.Luckily, Amazon let me return the item.I will be looking for a DIFFERENT juicer now."
3,Does what it needs to but just not for me.,"I loved the delicious drinks this juicer made and it worked really well. I had no mechanical issues for the month I used it for kale, spinach, carrot, cucumber, celery, apple, and cranberry drinks I was making. It was just way to much time for me to clean after I had made my drink . I guess I'm sticking to my blend and go smoothies from my personal blender."
4,Great Inexpensive Juicer,"As someone new to ""juicing"" I had hoped to find a juicer that was easy to use and easy to clean. This juicer exceeded my expectations for both. It juices items easily, the components seem sturdy, and its easy to disassemble, clean and reassemble. I've used it almost daily since I got it. My only ""complaint"" is the size of the feed tube. It's a little small, in my opinion, since I sometime need to split the thick end of a carrot to get it into the tube. Overall - I'm very pleased with this juicer."
4,juicer,"Works very well and easy to clean. The only thing that is a little bit of a pain is cleaning the round metal piece, but that is the only reason I did not rate this a 5 star."
4,Great Design and Price but Extracting Juice is Only Average,"I have had this juicer for over one year, using it about 4 times per week.Assembly: 5/5 stars - With only 6 parts (base, blade, pulp catcher, cover, cup and plunger), the design of this centrifugal juicer is its best feature. It also has a reasonable length power cord.Cleaning: 5/5 stars - Again, with only 6 parts, cleaning a juicer doesn't get much easier. For the blade, I use a nail brush.Operation: 5/5 stars - Flip the switch on, drop in your item and insert the plunger.Safety: 5/5 stars - The blade doesn't spin unless the cover is firmly in place.Juicing: 3/5 stars - I juice vegetables exclusively and unless I have a dull blade, ending up with dry pulp will take more than one run through the juicer.Value: 5/5 stars - Despite my average juicing rating, this juicer was designed for ease of use, so it won't just be sitting on a countertop gathering dust. Getting your money's worth with this juicer will be easy to do."
5,luv this product!!,"This is my first juicer and I love it ! I use it every evening, finding it very easy to clean. The chute (where the produce is put) is smaller than other juicers, so you have to cut up your ingredients. That is part of the fun - even my kids get involved."
3,Quality - Motore stopped working after 2 weeks,"First two weeks of use I was very excited for the value I was getting. Then It stopped working. I am now dealing with the company 'Waring' to return or get it repaired. I seem to be running into brick wall or get a 'run around'. I might as well forget this whole night mare. So watch out, buy it from a store so you can return it if required. I will update this review if and when I get the product fixed."
4,So easy & delicious!!!,My 1st juicer! It does a great job juicing. It is quick and easy to work as well as clean! Does seem to be a lot of pulp so I do not know how that compares but we mix the leftover pulp in with our dog's food (when it is food he can have) and he loves it and I feel I am not wasting too much! Glad I purchased this product! So happy!
2,Not up to Standard,"This is my 3rd juicer, and I was very disappointed. Because there is not a separate large capacity pulp collector, you have to open the juicer and remove the pulp if you want to make the full 32 oz the contaner holds. While juicing, the plunger would get ""sucked"" into the feeder tube and was very hard to pull out, and pieces of the pulp would fly out. Based on my previous experience, I also felt the juice yield was much lower. It was very noisy and I did not find it easy to clean at all."
3,ok juicer,"This juicer is not perfect but does the job.The Pros: fast juicing, easy assembly, easy cleanup, the juicer disassembles quickly and you don't have to put the whole juicer into the sink as some of the reviews mention. just read the instructions on how to take it apart.The cons: The juice splashes some while flowing into the cup. Nothing major, but it is a bit annoying. The way the pulp is collected makes it difficult to re-juice the pulp. It doesn't just everything completely. I keep finding big chunks of fruit or veggies unjuiced, even after putting it through the juicer again.I was expecting something better but for now this one will do."
4,Good juicer!,"I am pretty happy with this juicer. Its reasonably priced, not very noisy, works for fruits/veggies, easy to clean. The only issue i see is this product cannot be used for citrus fruits. And little bit of fruit juice remains in the pulp though."
3,great for the frasier fan,"if you are a frasier fan, this book is a wonderful behind the scenes guide to your favorite show."
4,Includes a song that 'changed my life'!,"As a June fan, there's lots to choose from, and as others have noted, this one is an experiment in folk/jazz. If you don't like that idea, go to the definitive collection, etc., as a starting off point.Having said that, there's a folk song on here - I'll put my ship in order - that is as good as anything that June has done, and since it's not on the definitive collection, you just may need to get this one!Used, it's an outstanding bargin; full price...you decide."
3,+ 1/2 stars...The Orchestral Arrangements Are Hit and Miss,"I first encountered June Tabor when she teamed up with Maddy Prior for 1976's SILLY SISTERS. This was one of my favorite Celtic albums of the period. While June Tabor remains one of the finest vocalists of the British folk music scene, unfortunately A QUIET EYE is not a traditional folk album--there's not a fiddle or guitar in sight. Instead Tabor works with the horn-laden Creative Jazz Orchestra and musical arranger/pianist Huw Warren.Standout tracks include the cover of Richard Thompson's ""Pharaoh"" and the a capella reading of ""The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face."" The one track where the orchestral backing works well is the closing 8-minute-plus medley. ""The Water is Wide"" provides a subdued piano backing to Tabor's ethereal vocal. ""St. Agnes"" is a lovely instrumental. The medley closes with another haunting vocal over a droning horn on ""Jeannie and Jamie."" [Running time: 58:54] RECOMMENDED"
5,An Excellent Eye!,"June Tabor's latest release ""A Quiet Eye"", proves faithful to a high artistic legacy. A treasured and gifted singer, Tabor's impeccable style and phrasing lends much depth to the arrangements guided by the Creative Jazz Orchestra. With a somewhat different approach from that of her past efforts, the slight and tasteful tinge of ""chamber-jazz"" adds just the right elements to such strong moments as ""I Will Put My Ship in Order"", ""Waltzing's For Dreamers"" and ""The Water is Wide."" The latter, a magically sparse adaptation of the classic song, showcases Tabor's gift for a soulful and balanced vocalese. I highly recommend this tasteful recording as a welcome addition to June Tabor's standard setting archive."
2,would help to be british,"There is a genre of English folk music that has never made it very well here in the colonies.The musicianship is stunning,the voices great but somehow it doesnt make it. Think of Bert Jansch,John REnbourn,Pentangle and the derivatives thereof.Maybe its because we never had Chaucer or Wordsworth or the Battle of Britain....whatever we dont have the historical vision. June Tabor is very nice but I think if I had grown up in the Lake District I would feel more into it. Its sooo British,songs about England,King Edward VII....to be fair theres also Richard Thompson(but speaking of being sooo British). Ms Tabor has a very nice very proper voice and if you are a Brit you may just love it.....one other thing tho'..i really dont think the voice and songs go well with the accompaniment of the Creative Jazz Orchestra....wd work better with John Renbourn"
5,Great,Got just what i ordered. On time and in great condition. Sometimes when you order these compolations the plastic insert loses its stickyness to the inside of the box. i just used some glue and everything was perfect again.
2,Buddha Bar Lover and collector,"Must say, the cd dubbed 'Paris' would have fitted a title 'Calcutta'As for the 'New York' cd, well, that's more like a disco run.Seems as if BUDDHA BAR series has lost it's sophistication.What ever happened to the different cultural feels world wide?Non-the-less, I can't say I dislike the two cds, it's just not BUDDHA BAR anymore. GEORGE V RECORDS GET BACK ON TRACK!!"
5,Great Grinder for the PRICE!!!!!,"Just got this grinder, and I am building a homemade 18 ft. car hauling trailer. Was waiting for this to come in, and when it arrived, I put it to some heavy duty use for about four straight hr's. This grinder handles great, with good balance, and a lot of speed to go along with it. I would recomend this for anyone that needs to do some heavy, or light grinding.Be sure to have a good set of goggle's and gloves when useing this grinder, it puts out a lot of sparks, and metal shaveings when in use........ BE SAFE......."
3,Soccer Goa; Set,"Nice for practcing if left put together. A REAL pain-in-the-XX to take apart, box, then put back up frequently!"
3,Comes apart.,"The size is right, but it won't stay together.You will have to use Duck Tape or small screws to keep it together when in use."
1,Do not Buy!,I just bought two of these and both sets arrived with parts missing. A waste of money and a waste of time.
3,I am mostly satisfied with the product.,"Overall it fit great though in one section the glue had come off and exposed the string that is inside. I did not think it would make a difference, but it did. The product fit perfectly except that section where there is a 1/4"" gap. That section was at the end. I had already spent over an hour installing it. So regrettably I did not take it off and send it back. So inspect it BEFORE installation! Other than that it's wonderful."
3,"ehh, I don't know","I bought this stuff, and analyzed the guaranteed nutrients. They have pro-grade turf fertilizer at a big box that comes with 50lbs for about 25 bucks with similar analysis and micronutrients. There may be some intangibles that I am unaware of, but I doubt this is any better. This is not even 10% of 50 lbs (4 lbs) I typically have used Milorganite in the past, which is basically just Nitrogen, to fertilize trees and they have always done very well. You never usually need phosphorus anyway (the middle number) Using a good well balanced turf fertilizer with similar ratios (NOT SCOTTS) and micronutrients, I believe, will harbor the same results.This was only enough to fertilize three 20' palms with a half dose, one time. I just had them installed a few weeks ago and wanted a good fertilizer to apply at a half rate to keep them healthy. I couldn't justify spending 20 bucks per tree every 3 months or so."
3,"good, but long","I really enjoyed the romance part of the story. There was a lot of action throughout. My only issue is that the political and historical parts tend to be way long. If that's your thing, you'll love it. Otherwise, it might take a little effort to get through it. Good book overall."
4,Enjoyed this book very much,I wasn't sure when I ordered this book but was very surprised that I enjoyed it as much as I did.
3,Its ok,This book drew me in at the beginning but lost me half way through. I actually considered not finishing which is something I never do. The book is a little long winded and although the ending finished strong I almost didn't name it there.
5,"Typo errors, but excellent read","While I certainly concur with the other reviewers that there are several typographical errors (presumably from converting the book to kindle format), I didn't find them to be overly distracting. My rating reflects the book itself - full of interesting characters and a dynamic storyline. One of my usual complaints with romances is that you can tell from the first few pages how the book will eventually end, but here it was not the case. I stayed up later than I should have finishing it!"
1,Could be used in a concentration camp,"This CD causes actual physical pain when listened to. Words cannot properly describe how absolutely horrific this is. It may well be the worst combination of sound ever pressed to CD. Fieldy's solo ""album"" is even worse than those of the band he comes from. Avoid this abomination at all cost unless you're a self-mutilator or something."
1,Fieldy's Dream = My Nightmare,"Ok, first off, let's clear one thing up: I listened to this album with my mind as wide open as I could possibly get it. Korn are one of my favorite bands and I didn't want to hate anything that a member of the band does. But when I listened to this CD, my first reaction was to laugh, and then it turned to sobbing. What was in Fieldy's head that made him think this CD was good? No offense but come on, this CD really stinks! I can't imagine anyone actually enjoying this CD on a regular basis. The production is great and some of the beats are as well, but the downfall of this album is truly Fieldy's lame lyrics and his very annoying voice. Add the two together and you get a tragedy from every perspective. If you are looking for some great rap/hip-hop albums, I recommend Wu-Tang's ""Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers),"" Outkast's ""Stankonia,"" Ice Cube's ""The Predator,"" Cypress Hill's ""Black Sunday"" and Dr. Dre's ""The Chronic"" and ""The Chronic 2001."""
1,OH... MY... GOD!,"This album is just too perfect. I mean, even if I would have plotted for months I never could have scripted this any better. The bass player from Korn, you know the short dude with pony tails who does that disgusting nu metal bob up and down thing all day, put out a solo rap record. This has to be heard to truly realize how bad it is. It's the closest thing I've found to actual audio diarrhea, you'll be begging for a Limp Bizkit remix record."
2,Should have stuck with Korn,"I am a big fan of Korn, and I will be the first to admit that Fieldy really sucks on this album. His talent is much more needed in Korn and I don't think he really deserves a rap career. The ONLY reason I am giving this two stars is because of the song with Jonathan Davis (Just For Now). Other than that, no self respecting Korn fan should buy this...unless your an avid collector of Korn items (like myself)."
1,horrible ...,"In what's obviously a cry for help, Korn's Fieldy throws us this mess of what seems to be a deperate attempt to be seen as ""hard"". It's full of self boasting ""I smoke pot and therefore that makes me cool"" bravado. No,you disturbed little man, what makes one cool is being themselves which is obviously what you aren't doing. This album is a great way to alienate Korn fans and make them either laugh at the stupidity of this album or make the rest of Korn just plain kick him out for this embarrassment.It's too bad Fieldy went for such an ego filled album. He's obviously got talent (playing all the instruments by himself, but the ""I'm a gangster"" pose approach just doesn't work for him. This cd should be avoided at all costs. Get the new Korn album instead where the music is much, much better"
2,ummm...,"Haven't really heard too much off this one, but it don't look good.... please fieldy, we don't need another Durst... if he throws on a red cap n uses words like ""ill"" or phrases like ""he-said she-said"" in everyday lingo, i think it's time Korn throws him out."
5,A great book with all the facts!,This account of the lives of the infamous Belle and Pearl Starr is wonderful reading. Phillip W. Steele has done a great job of giving the reader the facts while making it very interesting reading. I enjoyed this book.
4,belle starr,"This book, one of many on this complex western frontier personality, adds previously unknown discussed details of her life. The writer presents her in a more favorable light than I would, in view of the fact that one of my ancestors arrested her on several occasions when he was a deputy United States marshal. I view her from the law and order side. The writer views her as a human being but does not acknowledge her real criminal tendencies which were numerous. If she lived in this century, she would be in prison for a long time. But it is a very interesting book, nonetheless."
3,Reasonable for beginners,Those just beginning to use Dreamweaver will find the format and content quite good. Also good quick startup with some of the version 4 capabilities for the more advanced user if you've got the $s. Of little use for the more advanced user.
3,"Good Approach, covers the basics, but too many mistakes!","I am quite a fan of the Skills & Drills books, but this one seems to have been put together too hastily. When learning a brand new tool (like Dreamweaver), it is important that the book describe exactly what the student should be seeing on their computer screen. If this doesn't happen, you can spend quite a bit of time trying to decide whether the book has a mistake, or whether or not you made one. From the very beginning, where you need to work with files from non-existent directories on the included CD-ROM, to the widespread use of [Command][S] (rather than [Ctrl][S]), I was constantly having to go over things to make sure that it wasn't me that was making the mistakes.That said, I do find the approach of the Skills & Drills books in general to be very effective for the beginner. I'd recommend this book, but would caution the user to beware of the kinds of mistakes mentioned above."
5,Simply the Best Book there is on Dreamweaver 4!!!,"This is simply the best and the most comprehensive book available on Dreamweaver 4. The user manual accompanying the software did leave a lot to desire for but this book does not. Each and every feature of the software has been covered and the accompanying CD is a definite Plus.The chapters on Forms, Tables and Layers, Frames, and Code View, Styles and Behaviors are amazingly good and clearly explain the powerful dynamics of Dreamweaver 4 through well designed and easy to do exercises. Mr.Kevin Siegel has taken extra efforts to clearly explain some of the lesser known but very powerful features like Image Maps and Library which other books seem to ignore.Whether you are new to Dreamweaver or a veteran, this book surely belongs on your bookshelf both as a learning tool and a reference guide."
3,Streetwise Dublin map,"There're so many free & more legible maps available in Dublin that this map isn't really necessary unless one ventures outside of the immediate city centre or needs to find locations that aren't major attractions. The lack of eye-level street signage (Americans train your eyes to look to the 2nd story of corner bldgs for street signs in the city centre!)is a problem that not even the map can overcome, esp outside of the city centre. Few Dubliners kniow the names of streets & navigate instead by landmarks, so directions freely given by the Irish aren't always helpful. Grab as many of those free maps as you can! Taking 1 of the hop-on-hop-off bus tours early in your stay is really the best way to get oriented to what is really a very accessible, navigable, & interesting city."
4,Very good tool,"We have used other of the Streetwise Maps for areas of Europe and the United Kingdom. They are complete, sturdy with the laminate covering and easy to use. I look for these maps for any of the areas that we travel to."
2,not as useful as the map of edinburgh,"2/3rds of one side is taken up with a street index, which we didn't use. that leaves a reasonable sized central city map on the remaining 1/3. the other side covers too large an area, and the print is too small to be useful.we have bought streetwise maps before, and been pleased. some are better than others, however."
2,Dublin Map,"Didn't use it much while in Dublin. OK for preplanning, but too bulky and difficult to carry. Used free paper maps available from Irish tourist Bureau. Wouldn't recommend buying it in retrospect."
4,Great,This map was very helpful. What would have been more helpfull is if someone told me the street names are on the sides of the buildings/houses. It took me 3 days to figure that one out. I had fun getting lost though.
1,Horrible Quality Control,"Up until recently, I had been using his food exclusively, but after several disturbing incidents I have switched brands. In the last few months have found cardboard, hair, and a bug in three separate varieties of Merrick dog and cat food. When I found the cardboard, I contacted the company with my findings and they apologized and mailed me a coupon. Since then, I have found hair in two varieties of dog food and the final straw last week was opening a can of cat food to find a dead fly right on the top of the food. There is no way that this food is being produced in a human facility. The quality is appalling -- especially at these prices. I have spent thousands on Merrick pet foods, but they have lost my business forever."
3,It's a toaster- whadya want?,"The Proctor Silex 22445 works fine. It's a reliable, unobtrusive kitchen device. It's somewhat hard to clean, but, to be fair, no worse than average.It toasts evenly, and it's pretty affordable. It's a toaster- whaddya want?"
4,Better than season 1,"If you like Gordon Ramsay; you will enjoy the series and it does improve with age. Seasons 2 and 3 are more diverse and interesting than Season 1. Just a note for expatriates (like myself). Though one of the benefits of living abroad is avoiding much of the daily 'trash' TV, it does mean that you may not be familiar with many of the 'celebrities' who guest on the show. (It is interesting to watch these 'celebs' who are unknown to you as, stripped of their fame, you can evaluate these personalities and their talents objectively. Almost without exception, their only virtue appears to be their celeb status and most have no entertainment value or visible talent at all.) Fortunately, their appearances tend to be brief and it's a DVD; you can always fast forward."
5,Great,"This card works great, just make sure you grab the latest drivers from creative's website or you'll run into many issues!"
1,Very poor construction,"I live in south florida and needed a Generator box, not a lot of them on the market so I was happy that I found one. After putting it together I was very disapointed, it was very week,no strength, I would be suprised if it stayed together in a strong thunderstorm, forget a hurricane itwould be in a million little pieces. sent it back for refund"
1,"This unit is not safe,Please don't waste your money","I can't even give this unit 1 star,but i had to so this review would show up.Your just asking for problems if you purchase this.First,It's not safe to run your generator in it.You can store your generator in it,but just can't run it in this unit.The shed will end up melting away.Second,The price is way out of line.I purchased the shed ""GS2500"" for $219.00 at Homedepot.I then purchased a Gable Vent fan (comes with a thermostat which you need)$72.00,8-4"" mini louvers $22.00,20""x20""Gable Vent Shutter $43.00,one roll of Reflective Insulation $24.00, sheet metal for the back to protect it from the exhaust and to protect the floor under the generator,some screws, washers and aluminum tape about $20.00.I did it for around $400.00 complete and it's much safer.I added images of what i did to mine.Photo's aren't that great,but should give you an idea"
2,Mind-boggling - truly mind-boggling,"""Beautiful?"" ""Beautiful?"" It truly boggles my mind that anyone could lavish such encomiums on such a forgettable album. If you're an aging Kenny G fan with little use for any sort of invention or cleverness from your pianists, then I guess you could do worse. If you're looking to be challenged, entertained, or brought to any sort of emotional fulfillment, however, I strongly suggest you look elsewhere."
5,Simply Grand,"I heard ""All The Things You Are"" playing ""live"" as I entered the exclusive gift shop in Boca Raton, Florida. I immediately went over to the pianist, Gary Clark, and listened while he finished the selection. It has been one of my favorite pieces to hear on the piano for years! Mr. Clark showed my his CD, Simply Grand and asked me to select another choice to hear. I selected All I Ask Of You and he played it simply grand! I purchased the CD on the spot and all 10 selections have provided my husband and me with many hours of dinner music for us to enjoy alone or when we are entertaining! All 10 selections are fabulous!"
3,Super Reader,"I didn't find this book as much fun as the first one.Zachary Nixion Johnson has problems in quadruplicate, in the form of four super powered sisters. One of them going the crazed evil super villain route.He has a bit of a computer issue, as well.All this means that his enhancer bracelets and other gadgets get a fair bit more of a workout in this book."
3,tighten,"The product is nice but it seems not tight,it is difficult to tighten strongly because the tool moves a lot."
5,Best protection,"I like this lock for two reasons. 1) The ""key"" pattern being around the circumference of the nut is stronger. The other popular design has the key on the face of the nut. That style defaces often, leaving you unable to remove your wheel(s). 2) It's common for thieves to ""bash"" an undersized socket or special tool onto locking lug nuts, giving them enough grip to untighten them. This lug nut's outer sleeve makes that almost impossible."
2,A successful design?,"I just received these and pulled one out of the package and went to my tool chest and I CAN fit a socket easily into the area where a tuner key splined lug nut is housed in the middle of the sleeved lock. Of course what this means is that the purpose of the exterior guard that will spin and therefore protect the thief from hammering on an undersized socket onto splined the lug nut is useless and in fact, as I see it, it may even provide a handy guide for the under sized socket hammering! No doubt the interior splined lug is keyed to the enclosed socket that fits inside the sleeve, but essentially it's no different than any other uniquely keyed splined lug, only heavier because of the added useless sleeve. I suppose it's good in case the thief uses vise grips. For that I will give it a couple of stars."
1,Amazon has the size wrong,"Amazon says that these will fit my 2009 Honda Pilot, but they don't. Gorilla's own guide shows that the right size is 14x1.5, which I've confirmed online. Will see if Amazon will agree to accept these back at their expense."
1,False Advertising - Sizing for Car Model is incorrect.,"Gorilla Automotive 61631 Acorn Guard Locks (12mm x 1.50"" Thread Size) - Pack of 4- False Advertising, Does not fit BMW. Product chart for Model of Car is incorrect. After ordering these online, I tried to put these on my car and was unable to figure it out. I then took my car to the Mechanic and he said these parts do not fit my BMW. So now me and my friends are stuck with these because 30 days has passed and it is too late to return. HOW DOES AMAZON GET AWAY WITH FALSE ADVERTISING PRODUCT MODEL SPECIFICATIONS?"
3,unique design,"Unique design, looks difficult to break thru to steal your wheels. Looks great on my rims...only issue I have is the key, I think they are all the same?? as I bought 2 sets of these wheel locks...very surprised to find them keyed alike."
4,Check for fitment...,"I bought these for my '99 Corvette and they were too long to fit under the center cap of the stock wheels, so I put 'em on my truck and they're great. If your vehicle incorporates any kind of hub cap, check for clearance."
2,Unusual approach to wheel locks,Not the usual style for securing anti-theft locks on wheels. The wheel nut pivets/moves on a collar (which is meant to defeat anyone trying to get it off conventionally). Not sure this approach is wise for wet or wintery climates. Crucial not to lose the wrench extension needed to attach to such locks.
3,Paper cost exceeds Mouse cost after 5 purchases,"I wish I'd read the posts warning about the cost of the paper before I bought the Mouse. It's a very useful little tool, and it's easy to think of uses for it. Unfortunately, each use means a trip to the store for paper or pads. The paper is horribly expensive, and it's not feasible to substitute for it. I've used my Mouse on only about a dozen minor projects over the last year but have easily spent 3X the original cost of the unit on paper and pads."
3,Battle for the Huertgen Florest.,I don't believe Mr. Astor's account of the Huertgen Forest campaign flows as well as his Blood Dimmed Tide book about the Battle of the Bulge. I have read and also written about this campaign and find Mr. Astor's book authentic and reliable in its facts. It can be used as a source book to other writers.
3,Good...but misses the mark.,"This book certainly provides the reader with an understanding of the front-line soldier during the Battle for the Huertgen. However, Mr. Astor fails to provide a larger context in which this struggle can be understood. I had difficulty understanding how the local village battles related to one another or to the Corps or Army level for example.The oral history is good but the ""big picture"" is missing."
3,"Good Oral History, Old Arguments.","The strength of Gerald Astor's book lies in his oral history narrative. As a work of history, however, Astor breaks no new ground. The standard arguments: the Roer River Dams should have been the American's prime objective; the Hurtgen Forest should have been avoided; the American numerical advantage, armor and air supremacy were nullified in the confines of the forest, are repeated once again in Astor's work. Astor tries to represent as many units that took part in the fighting as possible. Good oral history, no new analysis."
3,Great Stitch Reference Book,"Bought this book because I wanted a stitch reference for making not just afghans, but smaller throws. This book shows 101 stitches and has the ""multiple"" factored in so you can pick a stitch you like, and adjust it accordingly for a size right for you."
5,Another good book,"101 patterns for my fingers to work. I think the book is a plus to my crochet library. I have used some of the patterns and have no problem following along.The patterns are a crocheters delight, from easy to challenging. And with the correct colors, the patters can be beautiful."
4,Lovely,"What a dream. I don't profess to liking everything Pat Metheny has done, or to having listened to everything that Marc Johnson has done, but this is lovely. If you can't drift away to the sounds of Porch Swing then you just don't get it."
3,What the Ventures might sound like ...,"... if they went to Berklee and started their careers at 40.This is a relaxed, comfortable, if unchallenging listen from two of the top guitar players of the age and a bassist who can (and has before) fronted a two guitar line up (Marc Johnson's Bass Desires -- check it out, Frisell and Scofield -- twice the music and twice the kick as that presented here)It's good music, but I expected more."
3,Sounds good,"3 1/2Interesting assemblage from the talented bassist provides calming progressions for thought, occasionally stumbling through questionable pacing and underwhelming chemistry, but more often providing insightful counterpoint to traditional trajectory by stretching into folksier realms."
3,It's only good if you're a Hebrew speaker learning English,"For every Hebrew word, they helpfully give you an English one. For every English word, they unhelpfully give you many Hebrew words with no explanation to distinguish the choices. Between the ""English to Hebrew"" and ""Hebrew to English"" sections of the dictionary there is a section explaining English grammar to native Hebrew speakers.I assume this is an excellent book if you are trying to learn English, but it is next to useless for going the other way."
3,Oxford Dictionary: English-Hebrew/Hebrew-English by Yaakov Levy,"I would have liked a larger font and, it would be great also, if the dictionary gave the gender of all nouns. Otherwise, this is a functional reference."
3,"Nice, but disproportionate English-Hebrew section","I agree with the previous reviewer who wrote that the writers of this dictionary had the Israeli native learning English in mind when creating it.Pros:-Vowel dots throughout-Wide range of subjectsCons:-English-Hebrew section way larger compared to the Hebrew-English-English section has quite a lot of abbreviations, for example FYI, without giving the reader the key in English (in this case, for example 'for your information')-English section lacks many country and ethnic names-No Hebrew grammar explanation (only that of English)-Print size sometimes seems too small to read comfortably-This edition is more than 10 years old by now, therefore you can't find recently popularized terms in it (like 'cell phone' or 'global warming')Overall it's good, but could have been better made and needs to be updated."
3,Great dictionary but print too tiny to read,"This is a wonderful dictionary, with a lot of usage examples and conveniently includes both Hebrew-English and English-Hebrew. However, the Hebrew print is teeny tiny. I need a magnifying glass to read it, and I'm only 49! Older readers will have a hard time with it."
4,oxford hebrew dictionary review,"A good dictionary, But only if you are hebrew speaking this is not for beginners in the hebrew language. But good if you know how to read and speak hebrew."
3,Arrived in fair shape,"I received the correct item in excellent time; however, although it was packaged well, the book corners were crimped and bent and the spine of the book was coming unglued making this a book that will fall apart with very little use."
5,Thumbs Up!,Excellent for beginners as well as a review for those with a little knowledge. Also able to download video charts and support materials. Highly recommend!
3,"Good, but missed the mark","Agreeing with another critic of the book, I have to say Thayer's treatment of the material was certainly more thorough. Solomon interjects too much modern psychoanalytical interpretation into accounts, trying to form a pattern for some of Beethoven's actions, particularly with his nephew Karl. Far too much material about Beethoven's music is missing - the stories about his struggles with publishers, including Beethoven's joke he played by telling one that his latest quartet was taken from pilferings of other works, when he had promised him something completely new. It's not a particularly bad read, although I must admit that far too often I was reaching for the dictionary (give the thesaurus a rest, Mr. Solomon). As an introduction into the life of Beethoven, not bad. As the definitive biography of one of the world's most revered composers, I don't think so."
2,Not Really,"Not really a biography, more a lengthy attempt to psychoanalyze the composer. Surprisingly little about his actual life. BUT such things as a whole chapter about Solomon's guess (all ""Beethoven Scholars"" have one) as to the identity of the Immortal Beloved, to whom Beethoven wrote (but may not have mailed) an ardent love letter -- then no real attempt to make this supposed relationship relevant to the man's life and work. More fuzzy stuff about Beethoven's attempt to become guardian of his nephew. Spare me.If this is the ""definative biography of Beethoven,"" lord help us."
2,Beethoven: Down the Garden Path....Again,"One would think a revised edition would correct the errors of the past, but here is an exception. Most of the mistranslations, misinformation, and inaccuracies of the original book have been carried over into this version. Although soundly criticized by mainly European scholars, this book continues to dazzle American academicians who have never bothered to double-check the primary source material from which quotes have been taken. Truncated quotes, misquotes, and half-truths support theories which the information in original form would have easily shown as false. The psychoanalyses included are ludicrous and often based on misrepresentations of facts. A strong caveat to all readers."
2,Too much pseudo-psychoanalysis,"A generally interesting, and presumably authoritative, narrative of Beethoven's life and music is too often de-railed by whole chapters of amateurish, armchair Freudian psychoanalysis. It is further side-tracked by the long-winded pursuit or trivia [for example, an entire chapter (40 pages) of stuffy prose evaluates alternative theories on ""who was his `immortal beloved'"" -- who cares? her identity is irrelevant].The New York Times Book Review may think this is ""a landmark of Beethovian scholarship and interpretation"", but in my view, the narrative frequently suffers from a rather pompous style of pseudo-academic writing. A good edit is clearly warranted. Not really recommended."
5,Sun Ra--The Soulful Madman Genius,"We all know that Sun Ra was a visionary of the caliber of Charles Mingus or Mozart. He considered himself not a creator of music, but a medium trough which eternal sounds and feelings flowed. High points of his fumbling but enlightening experiments abound on this box set, and I consider it the most accessible collection released to date for the uninitiated listener."
4,Botched production,"This box set offers examples for any kind of music that Sun Ra and his Arkestra made. Unfortunately, the liner notes are full of orthographical mistakes, the cover illustration is horrible and the sound quality often is the same. It's a bit very expensive for that. But if you focus on the music, it's worth buying."
2,Terrible sound quality,"This might be great material, but who can tell? The sound quality is so bad that you can hardly distinguish one instrument from another."
4,Hair Cutting Book,"This is a fairly good book, with some very good instruction, but I felt that the person who provided the illustrations could have done a way better job, or could have at least found someone to do better drawings than this. Other than that, a good text."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"This book is not ""advanced"", and the techniques are not those that professionals use! A disappointment!"
2,Knob comes loose,"Would you want a glass lid where the knob you hold can come loose? The head of the bolt that screws into the knob does not have a flat head or Philips head, so you can't truly get a tight fit with the knob. The knob comes loose every time I use the lid."
2,Had issues,"When we ordered our Swiss Diamond Set the 10"" lid was broken (not ordered from Amazon), ordered a replacement from Amazon and it too came broken - didn't even have to open the box to hear it. Called Amazon immediately sent a new one but this one was also defective, the handle spins in its place and the little vent feature doesn't really work because of this, not that it does much anyway. Otherwise the products from this company seem solid."
1,Incorrect Size,"I hate to rate a product one star due to logistics, but I don't want anyone else to waste time like I am. The product I received when I ordered this is only 8"" (20cm) in diameter, not 10"" (24cm) as described. I returned the first thinking it was a shipping error, but the replacement is the same size. In fact it is identical to an 8"" (20cm) lid I already have.Interestingly, this product is the only one that does not specify the metric measurement (24cm) in its title. I mention that because the European manufacturer deals in metric, so the metric measurement (24cm) is more accurate than the approximate English units (10 inches)."
1,No Item and No Refund equals theft,"I payed for a typewriter and after months no typewriter. I have made many attempts to have my money given back and RefurbExpress has not done so. They seem to be trying to dodge their legal responsibilities. If you are reading this review I say beware of trusting RefurbExpress. Their actions have demonstrated their dishonest business practices. As for RefurbExpress, If my purchase amount is returned I will add another review stating that you have done so. Until then I will continue to pursue reconciliation of theft."
1,Not worth the shipping cost,"This ""typewriter"" comes ready for the scrap heap new out of the box! The keys must be pounded for them to strike the paper and then they usually don't lay back down. The ribbon bunches up and the return arm flops around. The carriage moves sluggishly in a jerky fashion as the keys strike the platen. It cannot type in a straight line and it is noisy and smells like used ""3 in 1 oil""."
4,Handy,This is very easy on the eyes. I was impressed with how useful the information can be. Also there artwork by Robin Wood in the book to enjoy.Worth a peek
4,If you do a lot of Tarot you will like this,"I cast a lot of spells with Tarot before reading this book (like instead of using my wand, I used my Tarot), and I thought this book was totally cool. It works really well, and it is easy to understand for those who just started working with Tarot, maybe a little ""harder"" for those who have used Tarot a lot before. But if you really want to get into the Tarot this is a great book to start out with."
3,Okay for those just starting to learn Tarot,"If you're just starting to learn about the Tarot, this book Tarot Spells will give you an interesting new avenue to explore. Each spell is basically a progressive layout designed to provoke your subconscious into the action necassary for magick. More experienced Tarot readers and studenst will find the spells a bit tricky. The interpretations of the cards used here are the most basic ones. So, if you use Elemental Dignities or the Kaballah (I use both) the spells can actually seem to be opposed to the stated goal. The best advice for the advanced cartomanticist is to use the book as a framework for developing more nuanced layouts. This way, your subconscious won't rebel when you give it conflicting instructions. Recomended primarily for beginners. For iimediate and advanced levels only if they wish to use the book as a framwork, not as a grimior."
1,Ethics?,"A good collection of simple spells. However, I'm only giving it a star. It briefly discusses ""Ethics"". Yet it offers spells such as ""TO WIN THE LOVE OF A *CERTAIN* PERSON""? I see this sort of spell as putting a straightjacket on another's free will. Is this the kind of spell I'd want someone to cast on me? Hell, NO! Use your best judgement."
4,"A slow moving book, but still very full of powerful emotion.","In The Queen of Everything, high school junior Jordan MacKenzie has many problems including her dysfunctional family, her strange school life, and an annoying boy named Kale who just keeps following her. This book starts out a little slow, but after a little while, it becomes hard to put down. The plot line is amazing and very well thought out, and the characters are very realistic and true to life. This book has very true emotions and it will have the reader laughing and crying right along with Jordan as she discovers life's lessons."
3,not the best but not bad,"its not the best book i have ever read but its definately not the worst. i agree with the teacher (i am a teen) that said the author tries too hard to describe something but once i got used to it, it was a good book. it took me a while to get into the book -about 70 pages. after that i didnt want to put it down cuz i wanted to find out what happened to jordan."
1,The Queen of Everything,"Very slow, TOO MANY WORDS!! The book does not grab your attention. I do not understand Jordan's relationship with Kale, it is a non-relationship. It did help me fall asleep."
3,Okay Book,"This book had a great beginning, but the ending definately failed. This is a good book to read if you're really into this genre or desperate. I did, however, think that the plot was a very oringal idea."
1,You are what you eat...,"This review is geared toward parents who monitor what their kids read...My 13 year old daughter checked this out because it was on her A/R reading list. I thought by the cover art and the title itself, that the book was worthy of my inspection. I did a speed read through this book and was disgusted with it. I realize kids passively hear and see ""mature themes"" everywhere and this is why this type of material doesn't come into our home. This book has lots of profanity, detailed teenage sex (including the main character losing her virginity), murder, adultery, and plenty of good old teenage hatred toward everyone over the age of 29.That said I realize not everyone shares our tenets of living. This book is typical of what you would see in an R rated teen movie. If you allow your kids to watch R rated movies, then this book would be allowed I'm sure. For anyone seriously trying to raise their children with christian values, there are far better choices out there."
1,Queen of Everything,...Exactly what is the message to be learned from this for young teens? I couldn't find it. The adult relationships were too callous and manipulative - decided not to put on my 14 year old's list of preferred reading.
2,not so good,"When i installed it, it worked fine for about 4 months then it just gave out. Needless to say the warrenty was over with so I couldn't return it."
4,The Burmese Harp,"For some inexplicable reason, Amazon has removed the rate-movie feature from the main product page. One must now write a review in order to rate a movie and generate recommendations. This is not a review, but merely a means to allow me to rate this movie and improve my recommendations. If you are as annoyed by this new ""feature"" as I am, please register your protest w/ Amazon help."
3,The burmese harp,"This movie is a very interesting look into Buddhism. however this movie tend to dwell from specific reality of the religion such as the time it takes for enlightenment and the true facts of the religion. It's however very foreshadowing in regards to the use of the music. Before reviewing this flim, i would recommand opening a book on the basics of the religion."
5,"SUPERB, SMART, INFECTIOUS","What a great surprise! This record displays the talents of Dave Schools (Widepread Panic)& Layng Martine III (Bill Laswell). These two have really nailed it here---->tight electronic grooves mixed with organic touches that blend together to form a really unbelievable record. The production is first class, the packaging is fantastic and overall a phenomenal debut from Slang. Guests include: DXT(the dude that did Rocket), Pete Droge, Lori Carson, members of Viperhouse and more. Highly recommended for lovers of all types of music including--electronic, drum n' bass, ambient, funk, jam, pop---it's all over the place, but seamless."
4,If it is being moisturized that you seek...,"If it is being moisturized that you seek...This stuff is great. To be honest, I didn't like the smell of this item at first. It had a strange odor. I thought this strange considering it was fragrance free... but either way I am over it now. No moisturizer compares to how well it works. The smell has either gone away or I got used to it. Even if it was still there, I'd use it."
5,Great Stuff,No this lotion does not smell like Bath and Body works and yes it is a little pricey but it works great. I originally purchased this due to a diet program that required fragrance free and this is the best lotion out there fragrance free. Love it.
5,Fragrance free option for those that need it,"Many fragrances irritate my skin which also happens to be quite dry in the fall/winter. Curel's fragrance free lotion is the perfect product for me. The lotion itself is quality and keeps my skin hydrated all day. It is no too thick, greasy, or oily. In fact, it is the quickest to soak in of any lotion I've ever used. I put some on my neck, back, and shoulders each morning and it is fully soaked in and dry in just a few minutes. The lotion is not scentless (it has a very subtle 'clean' smell a bit like soap) but since there are no added fragrances it's perfect for someone allergic to fragrance, or a man who doesn't want to smell like flowers or fruit. I fall into both categories."
2,"Great music YES, great quality NO","Without a doubt I love the music on this Captian Rock collection, but come on, with all the technology available, how hard can it be to remaster/restore the music in at least acceptable quality?I bought this cd for replacing my own recordings on tape and original vinyl, only to find out that even my 20 years old tapes are in better shape than this cd. Oke, the dub-version of the ""Return of Captain Rock"" sound fine, but the (only 3:58 long) vocal version sounds like something played on My first Sony...To make this long story short, a great collection with a very, very poor soundquality and not worth your hard earned bucks!"
2,"Great music, but not great sound quality!","I have fond memories of Captain Rock's music, and it's nice to support the old school artists and see compilations like this, but I can't help feeling a little ripped off in this case. As mentioned in a couple of the other reviews, the sound quality is very poor and you can hear clicks and pops in places, so it's probably been recorded from vinyl.Cosmic Glide (Captain Rock's first release) is missing, and Cosmic Blast and Return Of Captain Rock aren't the full length mixes you'll find on the 12""s.What could have easily been a 5 star CD is only getting 2 stars from me, which is a real shame."
2,Major Disappointment! :(,"I am in total agreement with 'Raveric' on the quality. If you listen carefully you can hear the odd pop n' click and this tell me this album is nothing more than ripped off vinyl and released on cd. I was really looking forward to this cd but my electro mp3 collection sounds far superior. Why oh why did they give us the short (less than 4min) version of 'return of captain rock' but give us the FULL instrumental version??? This cd doesn't even include 'cosmic glide'. Thankfully i have a pretty good mp3 of the 12"" but it would of been nice to have it included.Now if only someone out there would release a double/triple cd set of full 12"" versions of all the classic electro with studio quality!"
5,"Sweet ""Pres""ents for your ears!","While Charlie Parker seemed to blow and wail with an exuberance that was nothing short of explosive, Lester Young blew soft and eloquently with an effortless rhythm that was nothing short of soft sweet flowing brilliance. The ""Pres"" perhaps made his biggest impression on Lady ""Day"" and his formative years with Count Basie and the interplay between him and Billie Holiday are historical jazz footnotes. Always a cool cat, never explosive, his art is a joy to listen to, and this collection is a nice start!"
4,6 DECK DEALING SHOE AND DISCARD HOLDER,"I HAVEN'T USED IT YET,BUT FOR THE PRICE I THINK I DID GOOD.I WAS HOPING THE ACRYLIC MATERIAL WOULD'VE BEEN THICKER,BUT IT SHOULD HOLD UP OK.I DO RECOMMEND IT."
1,DO NOT BUY! Terrible quality and bad customer serivce!,"I bought this item expecting to get what is described. In the pictures it shows this product and states below the picture that it has 6 decks of cards and a cut card. I did not receive these cards, and when I emailed them to inquire as to why I did not get the cards I received a nonsensical email telling me that due to the fact that the ""inventory is constantly changing"" they could not send me any cards... WHAT?!? In my opinion that is what is called FALSE ADVERTISEMENT which is illegal... Also the weighted ramp that holds pressure on the cards was very poorly made and would not even move. Please take my word and don't go through the hassle of buying this product. You WILL regret it."
1,False Advertisement,"I also bought this item expecting to get what was shown. In the pictures, it clearly shows six decks of cards and this is what I was expecting to receive. When I did not receive them, I called the customer care line to inquire as to why I did not get the cards. The representative was EXTREMELY rude and told me that she is sorry ""I never read the description before buying."" I told her ""I did, but the picture stated otherwise."" Then she tried to hang up on me while I was talking. I was BLOWN away at the LACK of customer care! In my opinion, that is what is called FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!!!! I WILL NEVER ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY EVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!"
1,package didn't include a discard holder :(,"Unfortunatly, the package didn't include a discard holder :(which was pretty important. Unfortunatly, my son didn't unwrap/open the box until xmas so we both were disappointed."
5,Exactly What I Expected and More,"I expected a 6 deck shoe and a discard holder. The actual shoe isn't top quality but I didn't pay for a top of the line shoe. The shoe is great for what it is and works well for practicing dealing. The discard holder is exactly what you'll see in any casino.With the shoe and holder I also received 6 low quality decks and a low quality cut card. I wasn't expecting the decks or cut card because it wasn't in the product description. I won't be using either the decks or the cut card because I use bee cards and a better cut card, but it is still nice to receive free stuff you weren't expecting.All together you definitely get your money's worth with this package in my opinion."
3,not sure if it is the book or i chose incorrectly,"was looking for a book with the basics and would focus on only that. this book wasted alot of paper with art. i can make and find my own patterns and ideas, i just need instruction and hints on how to finish a project."
3,nice but to small to read,"i bought this as a chrismas gift for my mother ,but product not correct size .i expected 16mm but when came stated size was 11mm .had to keep trying different angles to try to read charm."
3,It's okay...,"So far, not overly impressed with this product. Unless I use a lot of it, there's no improvement in my tangled hair. And even when I use a lot, I have found it not to do much. My hair does tangle easily, but it's not overly thick or curly or anything. I have found better luck with It's a Miracle detangler. But it is more expensive."
5,Love It,"Great product and actually works as promised, I highly recommend this product to anyone who's hair breaks easily or has a tender head."
3,Black Relaxed Hair,I tried this on my hair after I washed it and it didnt really detangle my hair. However I used this on my dog and it worked really good. I will try it again on my hair and hopefully have better results
3,Helped,"I have very long thick wavy hair and it tangles very easily so I bought this hoping it would help. It helped me, But It worked bout the same as the other stuff I have got before."
1,No help at all,"Great price, but you get what you pay for. For 3$ I got a bottle of water. Fortunately I was able to pick up some Miracle 7 leave in conditioner that worked a whole lot better than this stuff, which is going in the trash. I have no idea why people love this company, I'm guessing for the cheap-o prices, but it doesn't do anything for me."
3,Can you say SLIP?,"I used this product while going through my transition from relaxed to natural hair. My hair would tangle after washing/condintioning as the two textures of hair tried to kill each other. It worked, plain and simple. You don't have to use a riducules amount to get the job done either so this size bottle goes a long way. The only thing I would change is the smell. It's not the nicest in the world for me and the smell tends to linger for a while after it's been used. That would be the only Con I would have about it."
5,"4.5, A Gem!","I adore this detangler! I tend to put this on my damp hair and gently rake with a tooth comb for better results. I did it once on dry hair and it made my hair a little sticky. If you are afraid of cones you may not want to get this since the second ingredient involved is dimethicone it's something to keep in mind. Overall, I'm pleased with how manageable my hair became with the product."
3,Full Force -,This album is worth it if you are a collector and want all of there albums ever made but I would wait on this one and buy the other greatest hits album put out on Thump Records. Much better........
2,Very Dissapointed,"Being a fan of Full Force from back in the day, I was very dissapointed with the new album. Over half of the album is either hits they did themselfs or produced. Except for Float on With Us, there is no reason to buy this album."
1,OMG THIS THING STINKS!!,I BOUGHT THIS THINKING I WOULD ACTUALLY GET A GREEN CONTROLLER BUT I GOT A BROKEN PURPLE ONE! I DIDN'T GET THE TV HOOKUP THING! AND THE FREE GAMES YOU GAVE ME WITH IT DID NOT WORK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! E-mail me when you decide to give me a refund.
1,WARNING: DO NOT BUY THIS EDITION,The PE exam was recently updated to include a Construction Section. This edition does not cover this material. Future editions will. Kaplan's review book has the construction section already.
5,alot of information,terrific resource book. I read that it should help with PE exam. Will find out. Too much information though. Bought one for FE - passed it.
4,Needs update for April 08 Exam and beyond,"This book has a lot of information. If you look hard neough, you can find almost anything in it. The problem is there is so much stuff in there, that you need to spend a LOT of time with the book prior to the test figuring out where it all is. I would not even consider taking the PE exam without this book.BUT, with the changes to the April 08 exam, the book is not enough for the morning anymore. The topic areas have been rearranged, which is no big deal- some things in traffic are now in geotech, but you can still find them. The problem is the book doesn't have construction in it. I'm sure there will be an 11th edition that will change all that, but until then, you'll need additional material to get through that section of the exam."
5,Good so far,"Good for reviewing for the PE exam, very comprehensive. Note: I haven't taken the exam yet."
2,something's changed,nice & soft I bought a pair 7 years ago they finally wore out but the new socks seem different they're just as soft & great for a work out but they shrunk even on low & now they're too small
2,Nothing compared to Wigwam Men's Cool-Lite Mid Hiker Pro Quarter Socks,"Picked up a single pair of Wigwam Men's Cool-Lite Mid Hiker Pro Quarter Socks based on their reviews, and totally loved them. Thought I might be able to sneak by with cheaper ones within the same brand, and gave these a shot. Nope! Smaller, stiffer, and worse in about every possible way. Relative to typical socks from the Gap or whatever, I would also put these behind. Skip these, splurge on the Cool-Lite Mid Hiker Pro. Trust me!"
5,amazon/wigwam socks,I purchased [2] packs for my husband and he LOVES-THEM!!..they are high-quality and comfortable to wear...lowest cost on the planet...and delivered free to our home by amazon..what more could you want!!
3,Too Many Piano-Only Tracks,"I will be brief. I don't like hearing the piano by itself. Many of the tracks had no bass/drums rhythm section so they were not what I liked.Also, I like Jazz music that swings, and some of the songs did not swing.But the man is an outstanding player and I could hear the classical influence in his playing in that not all of the songs had ""swing"" but were still very musical, highly technical, and fast. I would say that sometimes his music is just too fast for my tastes, and I feel it reaches a point to where it is not as melodic. I like melodic music.In the future, I will make sure I sample the CD to ensure the song selections are more what I want to hear. I much prefer his later work, ""Bud Powell in Paris."" He plays slower, with a rhythm section that was quite good, the sound quality was better although it was recorded live and there is background noise that can be annoying - including what I assume are Powell's humming along with his playing."
3,Tricky album without Tricky,"Imagine you take one of Tricky's second album and replace the singers with people who sound rather similar, that is like Tricky, Martina, plus also singers from Massive Attack. You'd pretty much end up with this album. The music is VERY similar to Tricky's second album, that is dark and moody and sometimes a bit too repetetive. Even the lyrics borrow heavily from Tricky. And the whole thing appeared on Tricky's record label. Bottom line: If you like Tricky's second album, you will like this one, too."
3,"Baby Namboos, The - Ancoats 2 Zambia","So, the Baby Namboos' first album, Ancoats2Zambia appears on Tricky's Durban Poison label and has Tricky put in a guest appearance. If you said that they were simply Tricky-lite, that'd only be half true. Sure, there's the same paranoid trip-hop feeling (reminiscent of Maxinquaye and Pre-Millennium Tension), the wounded little girl delivery by Aurora Borealis (reminiscent of Martina Topley-Bird's vocals), and the harshly-whispered rhyme (reminiscent of Tricky himself). But there's a little more levity here than on Tricky's work, and that's what separates them. Listen to the near hopefulness in the music on ""Provoked."" There's some nice break action on ""Trials and Tribulations."" While Ancoats2Zambia deserves a listen (especially for the Geoff Barrow and Dillinja remixes), there's nothing here that hasn't been done better by Tricky or Terranova."
3,"Great Chew Treat, but Too Expensive","If these didn't cost so much, I would buy them more regularly. This is one of the very few chew treats that actually last long enough to require dedicated chewing, but they cost too much to but regularly. So, they're a treat when I can find them on enough discount to warrant the shipping costs."
3,Battery runs down quickly,"This saw is lightweight and easy to operate, but it only works well for a limited amount of time (10-15 min) because the battery runs down quickly. The recharge time is then several hours. If you have to do many repetitive cuts in the same day, and time is of the essence, I would select a different saw."
2,Battery Eater,"I have had experience similar to other users. I'm cutting up a few small plum trees, 6 to 8 inches in diameter at the base an smaller higher up.The fire storm battery didn't last 10 minutes for me. Instructions were ambiguous. One page says ""Charge battery for 3 hours before first use."" Another page says ""After normal usage, your power pack shuld be fully charged in 3 to 6 hors. If the power pack is run-down completely, it may take up to 6 hours to become fully charged. Your power pack was sent from the factory in an uncharged condition. Before attempting to use it, it must be charged for at least 6 hours.""I returned one saw to my local Black & Decker dealer. Their tool salesman thought the saw should provide better than 10 minutes service and replaced the saw no questions. The second saw provided the same story. After over 6 hours charging time the batery indicated 17.3 volts. After about 10 minuts cutting the battery was down to 13.3 volts."
2,battery life sucks,"like the compact weight but the battery even though rated 14.4 volts lasts less than 10 minutes of normal use, had to special order to get replacement batteries, would strongly suggest a better quality tool (de walt etc.) for other than a hobby user"
4,Very good saw,"This is one of the best saws for the price. It works as good as any others I've used and it's handy because the batteries will also fit into my De Walt 14.4 drill. The only complaint is that the De Walt batteries don't fit in the saw very well, and come out really hard once you get them in. The quick attatch for the blades is nice also. Again, you can't beat it for the price."
1,Getz tries his hand at 12-tone Big Band,"Although Stan Getz was probably the greatest lyric saxophonist ever, he was not content to sit on his laurels, and he was always experimenting with new forms.On this CD he plays with a Big Band trying to fit into noisy 12-tone originals pieces. The result is an unlistenable disaster.For a much better CD of Getz improvising with Orchestra, Try ""FOCUS"" on Verve, 20Bit.Stan would not allow this recording be released during his life."
4,"awesome sounds, but poor lyrics",I love teh latin sounds on this cd. An excellent band. I feel the whole latin flavor throughout the whole cd. The lyrics on the other hand are pretty poor. They are lame and don't go too much with the music. I think the cd would have been even much better without the lyrics at all!! But the sounds are really great!
4,Looking Backwards with Affection,"This is by no means the perfect novel. Nevertheless Walter Allen tries to write the english suburban working/lower-middle class world seen from inside the head of a non-heroic, not particularly brilliant, but lively and engaged British working man whose life runs from about 1870 to 1960. For anybody who comes from that kind of background this book communicates immediately. Allen's success is remarkable. I once leant the book to my own father in whom it provoked a lively flood of memories. Many more famous novels by better known authors do a worse job than this one."
2,Not exactly what I expected.,"I was replacing an old pair of m-frames I used to wear in the military, and the pictures looked pretty similar. Unfortunately, the lens I received when I got them didn't really match the picture. The lenses had a little more radical design and were much bigger than my old lens. I know that the larger lenses offer more safety for the wearer, but they're just goofy big.After reading other comments, it looks like I'm not the only one that got the wrong pair. Going to return them in the mean-time. Hope this helps."
3,todays Oakley M Frame into yesterdays frame,I had an old pair of M frame Oakleys that the lens broke on and the company said they discontinued that style but if you buy this lens you can trim the tabs with a wire cutter that fit it into the frame and they will work! For $75 it sure beats buying a expense new pair. The Lens was shipped in a few days and boxed up well.
2,Not worth it!,I Have had this style of Oakleys for over 10 years! I about got the Maui Jims Polarized glasses...Boy did I make a mistake! I dont notice much difference between my black iridium and these. I would NOT buy these again!
3,A disappointment.,"I picked up the new compilation eagerly, awaiting some furious punk. The first track by Rancid is definately a keeper, but other than that, there are three songs that are worth playing more than a dozen times: The Mighty Mighty Bosstones' ""Providence Is..."", The Vandals' hilarious ""S.W.M."" (it steals the album!) and No Use For A Name's ""Enjoy The Silence"". The rest is filler. Nothing particularly bad, except for The Bouncing Souls and Buck-o-Nine's shameful numbers.The 1998 Warped comp was much better. It had varied musical styles and infinitely listenable tunes from Bad Religion, NoFX, Bosstones, etc. Pick it up and avoid this one."
4,AFI owns this comp,Well I have to say that AFI made this comp worth buying. A Winters Tale incorporates everything about AFI that is great. Tsunami Bomb also has a strong showing and Bigwig had an awesome song. Rancids effort was sub par but they make up for it in their real albums
4,Great stuff,"I'm pretty annoyed that I'm missing the warped tour but despite the anger I decided to bring on more sadness and buy this CD. I was very delighted, thus making me very unhappy. Oh well. The cool thing is, all except a few songs are unreleased, and while that could just mean ""songs that weren't good enough for the album"" they're all great (some better than others but they're all different artists). Unfortunately, this CD is all punk, which I love but it would be interesting if they put in some of the reggae bands and stuff. Still, this is a great compilation CD wether you go or not"
1,Not what I expected,"I got this rose water to put in my tea. There is very little fragrance, if any, an no taste. I am very disappointed in this product. I doubt it would make a difference if you use it for baking or anything else"
5,Great Book,"I loved this book. Part of the reason i did was because Stanley Edwards Jr. actually came into our 8th grade class to talk to us. He was the father of our World History teacher. His story on paper is great but hearing him in person was even more amazing. The book i dont think says this, but he died last year right before or right after the book was finished. At least his story will live on."
5,Like talking to an old friend,"Probably 20 years ago now I read Joyce Maynard's column in the paper. Our lives paralleled in a lot of ways. All these years later I found her book detailing the every day lives of a mom and her 3 kids. Ms. Maynard is a true talent to take such a mundane subject and make it fun and interesting reading. Its not deep to drag you down, just a good light read. Since it was written so long ago it now brings back memories of raising my kids. The toys she mentions her kids playing with are in many cases not around any more, but I remember my kids having them. I think women with kids between 20 and 30 and also young moms in the midst of raising their kids will enjoy this book."
3,good for light use; develops leaks pretty soon,"This is a good blender for light use. We use it relatively heavily - almost daily. It started developing leaks in just a few months. changing the gasket seal didn't help. Other than that, it was able to blend/grind nicely. many many speed options which is great. So, it's probably worth if you use only lightly."
5,This is awesome,"I know thwt the following is said, and I quote ""Old school psychedelic warriors dish out some heavy duty proto metal blues rock that is guaranteed to fry your brain. Lovers of crazed all out guitar solos, this is your stop.""I'm very happy that this was my first stop when I discovered ""Stoner Rock"" - A definition that came up when I ""yet again"" was divin' into the psychedelic music of the late 60's and early 70's. This band is a shure hit........ Seek it out for yourself!"
4,Diamond in the rough,"I heard some of their music by chance and was surprised that I had not heard of them before. I wish that I had, 'cause I think I would have gotten into them when I was younger. Well better late then never."
5,US MAP,"I was looking simply for a good sized, detailed map of the just United States, so we could ""map"" out places we've been, and places we'd like to see. All the other maps I saw were either too involved, meaning it had things in addition to the states, too small, or too expensive for a simple plan. I found this map that I purchased perfect for what I had in mind."
5,Chosen by Nicholas Payton,"I love the concept behind Verve's ""Ultimate"" series. They've asked current, major musicians to compile ""The Best of"" recordings of historically famous players. For example, all of the tunes on this recording were chosen by Nicholas Payton. They've done such a good job of it that I'm trying to collect the entire ""Ultimate"" series.I've listened to a lot of Clifford Brown. This is by far my favorite CD of all of them. It's got a few familiar tunes but it also has some which I had never hear Clifford play before - like his version of Star Dust. It's absolutely beautiful."
2,Lackluster Brooke Shields,"No one in his or her right mind would purchase this recording after hearing the Donna Murphy revival. While I actually have a lot of respect for Brooke Shields as a comic and ""pop"" dramatic actress, I was extremely disappointed with her acting and singing on this recording. All one needs to do is play the Brooke Shields CONGA directly followed by the Donna Murphy CONGA and let one's ears be the judge. This album is a waste of money."
3,Good Piece but...,"This show is nice, very broadway. The music is nice, lyrics fun, and whole show a nice piece. It isn't something I would listen to over and over which is why it's only getting three stars, but it isn't something that I won't play from time to time. Of the two recordings I have (this one and the 2003 revival) there are MINISCULE differences, but I would say the 2003 revival is the better of the two (and cheaper). I like Donna Murphy's character over Brooke Shields. Good CD for collectors and new broadway listners alike. Fav Song: ""Conga"""
1,"Many ""Wrong Notes"" in this rag","Although Brooke Shields recived positive reviews in her run as Ruth in Wonderful Town I was VERY VERY disapointed with this recording, I think it is just verry simpal Brooke Shields is no Donna Murphy. Considering that Brooke Shields isn't one of our better vocalists, it is still a load of crap. Beyond Shields' and Wills' vocals, the rest of the recording remains the same as it was with Murphy and Westfeldt. Several tracks are untouched from the 2004 edition; these include the overture, ""Christopher Street,"" ""Pass the Football,"" ""A Quiet Girl,"" ""Ballet at the Village Vortex,"" almost all of ""My Darlin' Eileen,"" and, but for a spoken line or two, ""Conquering New York"" and ""What a Waste.""BUY THE ONE WITH DONNA MURPHY- A REAL BROADWAY STAR"
1,Exploded into a million bits - JUNK,"Obviously, this glass lid cannot take the heat, for when I removed it from the heat, it instantly exploded into thousands of bits.What I was preparing had to be dumped, since it was full of glass, glass everywhere.Junk, pure and simple. Check the warranty on the lids...N o W A R R A N T Y o n L I D Sso, there you have it.Maybe a nice all-metal hubcap from a '64 beetle will fit."
2,Pretentious And Ultimately A Bore,Sorry to disagree with so many here but I really wanted to enjoy this. I've read other works by the author that I thought were very good and I believe he is a very talented and thoughtful writer.In this book his reflections on his travels seemed joyless and trite. His interpretations of the artists and what they were conveying through their work didn't always seem to ring true to me. I kept reading hoping this would get better but I was disappointed. When he describes places he visits the people who inhabit them are strangely absent from his reflections. As a frequent solo traveler I believe you don't know a place unless you know at least something of it's people but the author seems to avoid human contact as much as possible to indulge in his intellectual fantasies about the meaning of the most trivial details. I think traveling with him would be a bore. Sorry but in my opinion this is a classic case of missing the forest for the trees.
2,"One half interesting, the other half excruciating","I somewhat enjoyed Mr. de Botton's philosophical meanderings of past thinkers, poets, artists, etc on the subject of travel. But I sure as hell would never travel with the guy! What a geek this guy is! Describing his travels to the Bahamas where he gets into a fight with his significant other over dessert was bad enough. But by the time I got to the passage about how he was afraid to dine alone in such an amazing and vibrant city as Madrid, lest he be mocked by the locals, it was too much for me to read on. His credibility as a travel writer is gone. I am now trying to sell my copy on this site. Maybe I'll attempt to read his book on Proust someday."
1,Is anyone at Amazon paying attention?,"There were at least 80 typographical errors in the text. This author is brilliant, but the Kindle-garbled version ruined the experience for me. (Also, the electronic version was more expensive than the paperback.)"
3,An ok book,"I love to travel, but this book just didn't inspire me as I hoped it would. I thought it was well written, but what was written was kind of boring. I often found my mind wandering to my ""to do list"" instead of to places to visit.I think the book tried to hard to tell me what the travel experience is like, through other people's experiences."
4,How to see,"In this small book de Botton explores many aspects of travel - why do we do it? what do we get out of it? He explores our expectations, our motives (the search for the exotic, curiosity), and what we are likely to realise from the endeavour.He explores the way different perspectives from different places and different people (especially artists) can freshen our view of the 'mundane', imbuing it with an exoticness we may have lost the sense to perceive. Lewis Carroll put it this way: `We lose half the pleasure we might have in Life, by not really attending'.Key people in the book include Huysmans, Hopper, Flaubert, von Humboldt, Wordsworth, van Gogh, Ruskin, Xavier de Maistre and, of course, de Botton!!other recommendations:'Against Nature' - JK Huysmans'Dark Star Safari' - Paul Theroux'Afoot in England' - WH Hudson'Travels in South America' - Charles Waterton'Sylvie and Bruno' - Lewis Carroll"
2,Feeble,"If you want your travels informed by head-up-the-wazoo literary pretension, this milquetoast is your man. Excerpt: ""The result was a rich green foliage in an almost perfect circle, like an archetypal tree drawn by a child."" No matter where this guy goes, he harks back only to his library and museum-dwelling. There is a dearth of first-person social interaction described in any locale of which he writes. Read travel books instead by those who can soak up the local color, and interact with real people, and be transformed by the experience. This guy could ruin any trip."
1,A Review Worth Reviewing,"I wanted to point possible purchasers of this book to a fantastic review in the London Review of Books August 22, 2002. Christopher Tayler has some powerful insights into the author's style and motivation."
1,The Art of Travel,"This book was a tiring read. I struggled to get through it. Only one chapter was remotely interesting and thought provoking. The rest was self serving drivel. If you need a book to put you to sleep on a plane or train, this could be it."
5,The Perspective of a Former Peace Corps Volunteer,"I served in the Peace Corps while Norm Rush was Co-Director of Peace Corps/ Botswana. Norm's book is an excellent protrayal of volunteers and other expatriates. Moreover, it is a terrific read. Although it is ""fiction,"" I recognized all the characters as being ""real."" Nevertheless, although the book does ring true, it is not a complete portrayal of Peace Corps Volunteers and volunteers from other countries. What Norm doesn't decribe, probably because they are less interesting from a novelist's perspective, are the many volunteers who did their best to learn Setswana (the national language), who did their best to succeed in the culture, and who worked hard every day. Norm's book is excellent, and although fiction, it is an accurate protrayal of expat/ volunteer life, but it is not their whole story."
4,Skip Mating... Read this,"I tried to read Mating when I was a Peace Corps volunteer in Botswana, but like everyone else I knew, had to put it down because it was such rubbish. When I came back to the US, I was amazed and enthralled with Whites, a collection of lucid and often funny short stories. Mating has little or no foundation in reality (even some of the Setswana words he uses are incorrect or don't exist). Whites is a telling portrayal of expatriate life in Gaborone as it was in the late seventies and early eighties. Even though I lived in Gaborone from '95-'97, some of the stories still rang true to me. Don't waste your time on Mating, this is the book to read."
3,Disappointing. Probably much more interesting if you have been an expat in Botswana.....,"I, too, have been a Peace Corps Volunteer and an ex-pat (although in Latin America, not in Africa), and I approached this book with the hope of finding nuanced and insightful stories about the ex-pat life in general. Unfortunately this book fell far short of this goal, and I suspect that nearly all of the glowing reviews of this book were written by friends or associates of the author. (Indeed, some of the reviewers reveal such a connection with Mr. Rush.) Mr. Rush's stories suggest ""earnest amateur author"" throughout.Undoubtedly Mr. Rush witnessed the behaviors and conditions that can make ex-pat life a fascinating study, but his writing -- especially his characters overdrawn to the point of caricature -- reveals the immense gulf between the ability to observe, which many of us are capable of, and the ability to express artfully, an ability mastered by very few."
4,very cute,"this ring is a very cute ring. the only problem i have with it is, the petals catch on to some of my clothing. Still very cute and good value."
5,Madeline doll is just adorable!,My daughter smiles at Madeline every time she sees her and she loves to hold her. This Madeline doll is the perfect size for my daughter to enjoy - and I must admit that mom enjoy's Madeline too. I have loved the Madeline books since I was a little girl and I am thrilled to get my daughter the Madeline doll.
2,Didn't live up to my expectation,"The ideas represented in the book is good and may probably work very well in an assembly line environment. But the authors, being from a production/assembly line environment, doesn't make it very obvious how it will work in a service environment or an ""unusual"" environment like mining. It therefore has limited application. Having said that though, some good ideas can be taken from the book. I also expected a lot more professional presentation from a book like this. There are huge amounts of typo's and one sometimes need to first figure out what the real numbers of the figures are that the text refers to. It also reads very difficult, with a lot of information given in one sentence."
4,Best Indoor Volleyball Made,"I've been playing volleyball for 30 years and coaching for 20 years. The moment I was introduced to the Tach SV5W there was no turning back. It is the best volleyball made for serious volleyball players. Until two years ago it would have been a 5-star ball but the SV-5WC (color) balls have been hit and miss. Of 12 new balls I had to return 2 due to defects. Tachikara has a great return policy but one ball, after 3 returns, never was quite right.But it's not stopping me from ordering 12 more this season!"
5,best indoor volleyball,"For the indoor leagues I play in, this is the de facto ball that is used in every match we play. I know that there are a few other balls that also are popular, but this one is big for city indoor leagues in northern california. Setters in particular love this ball. I think the ball used to be softer, so a little break in period may be required to soften it up."
2,Defective balls,I bought the ball from Amazon.com. It's really excellent ball to play with until I saw the leather start peeling on several spots within 2 months of the purchase. I contacted Tachikara to get replacement and it cost me $15 to ship it back. I just got NEW replacement 3 days ago (it took 1 month for inspection and shipping) and was doubt with the quality by looking at the assembly. I inflated the ball carefully following the instruction. I've been using for 2 days and now the ball is leaking on the valve. I don't want to spend another extra $15 to ship it back. It's really poor quality made for such a famous brand. I'm really out of luck.
3,Good ball but not as soft as I wanted.,This is a good ball but is a little harder than I wanted. It has softened up some with more use though. I love the way it looks though.
4,Nice Ball,"I think that this a very nice ball to play with... The main criticism I have heard about it is it's durability and since I've only had it a short time i cannot comment to that regard... But feel, weight, and play-ability are all great in my opinion. Also, for those who don't like really heavy feeling balls, weight-wise, this is the ball for you."
5,One of the best volleyballs out there!,I'm so glad I was able to strike such a good deal on Amazon with this high quality volleyball.
1,Make sure you get what your order,The Volleyball I received was not even a Tachikara ball. It is frustrating to find out significantly later that what I ordered last year for a Christmas present was not what they received. How did I find out... They asked for the same thing last year cause they didn't get what they wanted last year.
1,Went completely flat in a few hours.,"A few hours after filling it up it was completely flat. Unfortunately, I missed the return window, which was only 1 month. I must be a slow learner, since I received this same model of ball last year for Christmas, and the same thing happened. I had figured Tachikara is reputable company and my first flat ball had to be a fluke. Nope. I got the exact same ball with the exact same results. I wetted the surface of both balls, and both of them had air leaking out of nearly every seam. Don't waste your time and your money. You will have a high probability of getting a flat ball right out of the box."
2,Hard to Inflate,"The ball comes deflated, so you need a pump to inflate it. I inflated it so that it was semi-hard, but when I tried bouncing it, it didn't bounce well. Also, if you pump up the ball enough so that it doesn't feel flat, and compress quite a lot if you press into it, it is a lot heavier than normal balls. The ball looses air very quickly. I don't know if the ball is bad, or if I am inflating it incorrectly, but instructions are not included with the ball."
4,The Ultimate Pipe Book,I have not read this book was hoping for lots of photos. But it appears quite informative. The Ultimate Pipe Book is the top reference guide for pipe smoking enthusiast.
5,Great book for new AND seasoned pipe smokers,"After reading the reviews for both this and Mr. Hacker's 21st Century ""update"", I purchased both books and was not disappointed. There are some duplications, but they are two different books. The portions that are duplicated between them are worth re-reading anyway. Mr. Hacker does a fantastic job at bringing in just the right amount of detail to keep the book entertaining and moving. As a fairly new pipe smoker, I purchased the book to learn more about the hobby. I found that I didn't want to put it down and appreciated all the information Mr. Hacker had put in the book."
3,Cute Tablecloth weights,"The tablecloth weights are nice quality and pretty heavy. If you have a lot of wind, you may want to double up and get 2 sets. The only thing is that the clips are not stainless so they do put some rust on your tablecloth. All in all a good purchase."
5,Heavy - Pretty Table Weights,"I have other sets of table weights and wanted something spring/summery to use. I ordered these and used them all spring and summer. To avoid rust, I sprayed them with a clear rust prohibitive spray so I didn't have to worry about bringing them in when it rains. Very happy with product and they shipped promptly."
5,Couple of sets,I got a coupke of sets from these as a gift. The were very durable and heavy. Very nice detailing and function.
5,Great Tablecloth Weights,"I bought this as a gift for a friend. She needed it, so I bought it for her. She really liked it. They are very heavy and when the 'Santa Ana winds' blow in Southern California, her tablecloth won't blow away with them!"
5,Just what I wanted!,"These tablecloth weights are wonderful!!! heavy enough to keep a stiff breeze at bay, attractive enough to win compliments!"
5,What are you waiting for buy it now,"...This cd will bring a smile to your lips, a samba in your hips, and a swoon in all the chicks!!! lousy poetry I know but an awesome CD!"
5,Most upbeat album ever?,"I love this CD. It just keeps on getting better with time. It is just a shame that 99% of people will never heard these tremendous songs. I counted 10/16 songs on this CD I give a 10 rating to. What is great is the other songs are good as well. There is not a lemon on the bunch which is unusual for these compilation albums. I cannot recommend this highly enough. If you managed to somehow discover this CD and are reading these reviews, you will like this CD. A must buy. It is impossible to be depressed when listening to this."
4,NIKE VS LOIN CLOTH,This fast paced easy read about a typical Joe Blow hurled back in time to deal with life in Stone Age America kept my interest from word one all the way through to the unexpected tongue in cheek ending. I enjoyed the contrast presented between modern and ancient man; each with lessons to teach and learn. Knowledge or experience; which is more valuable for survival in 200AD? YOU DECIDE!
2,Fast read,"I immensely enjoy time travel genre, and Mr. Steele Gray carries off the concept fairly plausibly. However, the book in general lacks rich descriptions of the prehistoric time into which the hero is stranded. Mark, the hero, never really encounters any serious danger through out the entire book, making the book rather unexciting. Compared to Diana Gabaldon's ""Outlander"", another time travel novel, ""Survivor"" was flat and uncomplicated."
3,"Starts fast, gets slow, then picks up the pace..","Starting fast, at the very beginning of the book, Mark is taken by lightening back to prehistoric times. He begins to wander, looking for civilization, and the pace stays pretty brisk and he encounters one trouble after another. I thought the pace of the book slowed though, as his endless trek dragged on and on with pretty much the same fears and thoughts being repeated. Then Mark meets up with Um-See, and the book takes off again. I think Mr. Gray did a decent job at portraying the thoughts and actions of this tribe of people. The ""communication with the present"" part of the ending should have been left out. It contributed nothing and somehow made what Mark accomplished with Um-See's tribe seem less important. All in all, still not a bad read."
1,Wrong Prices,My name is Bill Levy.The price of $72 is not correct. It lists for $24.95.Please give the correct price for the book and the cassette and why isn't it in audio cd in the 21 st century?Bill Levy
1,bland,"This is a really, really bad album. I've seen this band live and have listened to this album and I can safely say this is really bad ""jazz"", if you can even call it that. Stick with Coltrane."
2,Not adequate !,"I was disappointed with the quality of this heater, it produced very little forced air and did not heat the room that way I hoped. Not usually typical with Delonghi products to not be efficient."
1,Total Garbage!,"Save your money... this heater is NOT safe at all. It actually gets very hot to the touch, emits some type of chemical smell when first used, and did not warm my living room at all. To top it all, the quality of this heater is very poor. I returned it and bought a Vornado whole-room vortex heater-- which stays cool AND heats the entire living room perfectly (for the same price)."
4,It gets the job done,I bought this heater last year for my bedroom. It keeps everything nice and toasty in there. Good room (midsize) heater. Would buy again!
3,Good enough isn't really good enough,"Abbado would have been more successful in these incidental pieces if he conducted with more flair. The Berlin Phil. sounds gorgeous, as does DG's engineering. But Abbado had already done a good enough job with each piece for Sony, where these works were more fittingly paired with the symmphonies rather than standing alone. The Tempest is one of his least inspired tone poem-like works, and Abbado shows only moderate interest in either the Marche Slave or Romeo and Juliet.Oddly, he gets most fired up over the most bedraggled warhorse here, the 1812 Over., which receives the full birtuoso treatment, all guns blazing (actually, no guns, only percussion). I supose the marketing people at DG wanted to update some of Karajan's pop material, but I don't see these just good-enough performances reaching a wide audience."
3,Expendable,"Expendable is a rebirth of old school video games, it's simple, easy to pick up and entertaining. You run and kill, pick up cool stuff to help you kill more, kill with a friend, kill with cheats, kill with customized controls, kill with EXCELENT graphics! Have while killing mindless droves of enemies!"
3,westerns,"This movie was fair, but it lack the action and drama the actors gave it there best, but it was not good enough,"
2,Don't even think about it,I was disappointed of the visual quality of this dvd. Also the scenario and the cinematography is way too bad to watch this film. I don't recommend you to buy it. The only good thing is its cheap price...
1,"Possibly the worst, most boring movie ever made","Wooden acting, dull dialogue and hopelessly padded this maybe the worst movie ever made. It is almost in the so-bad-it's-good category but too dull for that.By way of example a scene of the characters traveling back in time is 5 MINUTE montage of stock footage from World War II, Civil War and Roman movies. 5 MINUTES!There's more techno-babble than you'd get in a year of Star Trek and worse special effects than early Dr Who.I only saw it because it was on the flip side of a copy of Things to Come. Please, please don't watch it, even as a joke, just stay away."
2,"El Cheapo, but still entertaining...",This old movie used to play at the drive-in and at 4 movie special showing at different theaters. These were fun movies to watch and for 35 to 75 cents for a showing...they were great.What can i say....I still like this movie cause mostof the equipment they use is now antiques...and the charactersand the story are still very much watchable.Grab your rocking chair and enjoy...
3,Journey to the Center of Time - Review of DVD,"I was excited when I saw this ""B"" classic from the 1960s. This movie is probably PD now and this DVD is only fair picture quality and color. I assume this had 16mm pre-print material. If you like the movie and don't mind fairly poor quality, check it out."
2,An Imitation,"Journey to the Center of Time more then liberally borrows the idea and most of the script from an earlier movie, ""the Time Travelers"" (1964) Including the future leaders name Vanni vs Vanno. There are only minor changes and infact it uses footage from the ealrier work to depict a starship that is being pepared to leave the earth with the last surviors of the civilization. Although the original is a bit hokey, by todays standards, it was the original and has a cameo by Forrest Ackerman, the ultimate fan and the man who coined the term ""Sci-Fi"". If you like grade ""B"" science fiction and enjoy doing your own version of MST3K, this is then a movie to watch, otherwise..."
1,"don't buy, money waste, forget it",terrible sound and video quality. i could not watch it far than first 20 minutes. on the same level as most of the Alpha Video [...] made 8-16 mm transfers which simply belong to a waste bin if you have at least 1 star of self-respect.
5,Classic nes mario,"When i first played this game i thought it would be different but i was wrong. At first i was kind of mad then i thought this is kind of fun. it was the original nes series (which i have) plus a new one called the lost levels. Since i have the three on the nes i knew everything about them so i beat them in about three months. However the lost levels was new so i had a little trouble at first untill i beat it. They have great graphics. They changed them so they look much better then the original. The sound also changed and is better then the original but it is still the same background and music. I loved the new save feature on it. Later i dicoverd that the same super mario 1,2,and 3 came out on the GBA. They have the same graphics and sound as all stars but they come in seperate packs called super mario advance. Now u can have the original series on the go!! This is a great game."
5,can't beat this!,"This game contains a mixture of all the super mario games. It's a really good game. My favorite one on here is Super Mario Bros 3. It's a good game with decent graphics. My second favorite is the second mario land game. I think they have a racing game on here. It's a really good buy because it has about 4 or 5 different games in this cartridge. Worth your money! Every day after school when I was a kid I would always play this game. It is very addicting. If you still have a working super nitendo system in your house, and you don't have this game, buy it! It is very addicting so if you have more self control than me, you should definitley buy this. Best super nitendo game ever!!!! A truly must buy if you still have a super nitendo."
5,I Wish They Made This For GAMECUBE!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is one of the funnest games ever. I am 27, and Super Mario Bros. for NES was the first video game I can remember playing at home. It is still the best if you ask me. I wish that they would make this game for GameCube and include Super Mario Brothers for Super Nintendo as well. I know that you can get most of the old Mario games for GameBoy, but I would rather play them on my other system (on the Big-Screen) in the living room. Great Game!!!!!! Hope they decide to re-release."
5,What a great mario collection,"All four games the same one's from regular NES now on Super NES all in one tape.Mario Bros 1 (3/5)-which was better on super NES it's the one that started it all.Mario Bros 2 (2/5)-it was different from the mario games you get to pick stuff out of the ground it could be a big man magic potion or throw turnops. A flying heart is what you have to grab for an extra life.Mario Bros 3 (5/5)-my favorite on. I love going to all the lands I don't need a wistle to skip a land I can beat all of Kopas kids still the wonds and change the princes back to normal. My favortie land it ""Dark Land""Mario Bros 4: Lost Levels (4/5)-it someting similar to the first mario game cause it has the same settings but it defentaly makes the first on look like your going through basic training and boyscout can past the first one. If you can beat Lost Levels your the man."
5,Take one step and then again..let's do the mario !,"I was 12 years old when Super Mario All Stars hit the shelves and I'm sure I screamed and cried and begged until the brand new copy was in my hands, ready to slam it into my Super Nintendo (yes, I was THAT kid) Fast forward 18 years and as a 30 year old, I yearn for my youth. I purchased a Super Nintendo clone and knew I must get my hands on Super Mario All Stars once more.The game is exactly how i remember it...awesome! You can play all of your favorite NES mario games without swapping cartridges or blowing into the system to make it work. I could spend hours squashing koopas and saving that ungrateful princess!"
5,any of these games alone would have made me buy this,the mario brother's series from nes was awesome i especially loved mario 2 and 3. the graphics have been updated which can be a good thing but really i liked the older graphics but this game was great
4,Dandy if you don't want to use an old NES.,"I traded this game and the person I traded it to got ripped off by himself and gave Zelda: A Link to the Past and Illusion of Gaia. If you have a NES and all of these games, I don't reccomend it. If you're in it for The Lost Levels and haven't gotten Super Mario Bros DX it may be useful. The good thing is you can save your progress because you can't really beat these in one sitting and all of the games are compiled together. The graphics are improved but what old school gamer cares about graphics? The SNES controller is nice though and gives better control. If you have a SNES and don't want a NES this is great but if you have a NES and all of these games rent it first if you find someone who still has the SNES classics. I personally feel its overrated in a way."
3,Fun games Broken controls,The game had 4 games but the controls were slippery and caused me to die way too much i would recommend this to people who are very skilled at mario
3,Super Mario,My kids ages 5 and 3 really enjoy this game. Why buy a new system when you can have the classics? This is great for younger kids.
5,Super Mario All-Stars,Mario All-Stars is one of the best games ever made and I was so excited to find it for a good deal on Amazon. The used copy is in perfect condition. Thanks!
2,A mixed bag...,"I purchased this set for my 2-year old twins that love to help clean up in the kitchen. The mop broke almost immediately because the handle is made of plastic and snapped in half. The dust pan and hand broom were made well, hard plastic. I wish the broom and mop handles were made of metal or even wood (like a real broom). The plastic on both are very flimsy and cheap. There are also ""fake"" boxes for gloves and soap. These are empty and just used for show.. my children just ripped them up. The apron is made of hard plastic and has short flimsy ties. I wouldn't recommend this toy regardless of age group."
1,Not a Good Idea,"My son received this as a gift for his 2nd birthday. Almost immediately after opening the box, the mop handle broke in half. About 20 minutes later the broom was broken as well. After only playing with this toy a few times the only parts still in good condition are the hand broom, dust pan, and dusting mits. However, my son does not like the way the mits fit him and does not use them. I have seen other cleaning play sets that are much sturdier for similar price. I would not recommend this toy to anyone."
4,wonderful,"0i ordered this cleaning set for my daughter and she really enjoys it. the dirt devil logo makes each piece seem so authentic. her 3- year old aunt really took a shine to it, and even took the dustmop home with her. we only wish that she would have asked us first if she could have it."
1,narrow minded,"I looked forward to reading this book and was so disappointed with it. I found the author's attitude to be quite narrowminded. I was particularly offended by his comments on whether animals feel pain or not, and his argument that for the greater good it was OK to continue with animal experimentation left me feeling nothing but distate for his ideas."
3,Still in black and white,"I searched your site for a Lone Ranger DVD or video that would be colorized. When I ordered this item, I thought I read that it was ""in color"". That was my mistake. So my grandson, who doesn't have a clue about black and white TV, was very disappointed. The adults were disappointed because it took so long to get our purchase. It was coming from here in our state and it took 2 weeks to get it."
1,eeewwwooo! worst golf game ever,Donot buy this game. the outside looks are good but apart from that the playability of the game su.. the AI is ridiculous and laughable. stick to TW 99 if you are a real golf fan. It is a total waste of money.
5,raw is tiger,this game haseverything and anything you need to enjoy a great golf season or just playing in the masters the creat a golfer is the coolest and this is definetly the best golf game ever u must buy this one
3,An Enthusiastic Pep Talk,"Not my favorite Campolo book, but worth a re-read. Short chapters lead to a lot of topic introduction...but not much development. This leads to a fever pitch pacing: the book's intent is to get you excited. Seize life! Do something! Experience things more fully! A good reminder to shake you out of the doldrums.My favorite section, as usual, dealt with living more simply. His advice on page 223 regarding a christian standard of life is an articulate rendering of that which I'm trying to already do: stick to a standard of living...resisting the urge to 'grow' as the income does.This book has something for everyone...and would make a good small-group book, as the chapters are short, no punches are pulled, and there's bound to be some lively discussion."
2,Glass cracked from heat of light,"This is one of two fans I purchased from Minka-air and I have mixed feelings:Pro: overall nice quality, nice design, very easy fan blade installationCon: the glass dome cracked after about an hour of use, it was very hot when I removed it. (I will be contacting the seller to see how they resolve this and increase/decrease my rating accordingly) Also, there should be a manual switch for the fan direction change: on the other unit I bought it is stuck in the reverse direction and cannot be changed. Very annoying."
2,Truth is more interesting than this fiction...,"Mr. Paul has taken one of the most spectacular murder scandals in American history and made it the background for the story of a fictional young reporter breaking into the press world of Jacksonian New York. However, in the process he has fictionalized the murder of Helen Jewett and presented a preposterous ending which has nothing to do with the real facts of the true historical events. I would recommend reading ""The Murder of Helen Jewett,"" by Patricia Cline Cohen, which, while a non-fiction book, is an incredible piece of detective work and far more suspenseful and fascinating than this rather bland piece of detective fiction by Mr. Paul."
3,Very Interesting History Book,"For serious history lovers, especially those interested in social history, this book is excellent. Very detailed, and for me it explained why my mother cooked the way she did. (All convenience foods!)."
3,Too much political agenda,"When Shapiro sticks to the subject matter of the title of the book, she shines, as she did in Perfection Salad. That part of the book is interesting, witty and well researched. However, she loses focus often, wandering into race relations, NAACP politics and feminism. While these are admirable topics that need to be addressed, their inclusion in this book seems like filler to plump up the page count. It's forced. Shapiro seems to devote as much space to Betty Friedan as to Julia Child. If you want to read about the 1950's in general, seek out David Halberstam's eponymous book.This book was a disappointment after Perfection Salad."
2,I was very disappointed.,"I thought I would LOVE this book -- I love to cook and to read about the food and cooking industries -- but I really found it boring and hard to get through. The only parts that were worthwhile were the sections on Julia Child and on the evolution of Betty Crocker. But I thought Shapiro went on WAY too long about Poppy Cannon, with too much biographical data that really didn't have anything to do with Cannon's work or her influence on cooking. Too much of the book just seemed to be laundry lists of yucky-sounding '50s recipes and failed products by the food industry. And I thought her efforts in the final chapter to draw similarities between Betty Friedan and Julia Child were bizarre. That made no sense to me at all, and it seemed to me that she only did that to end the book on a provocative, pseudo-political note. I can't help thinking the glowing reviews of this book that appeared in the media were chiefly a result of Shapiro having a lot of good connections."
2,Ridiculously small,"2"" is much smaller in real life than you picture this thing being. Pretty much worthless due to it's tiny size. Oh well."
5,Excellent campfire grill!,"This campfire grill is easy to set up, well constructed, versatile, and easy to use. We use it on every camping trip. Sometimes we cook food directly on the grate & sometimes we use it to place a small cast iron pan over the fire. I agree with other reviewers that the travel bag is a bit cheap, but that is a minor issue for us."
5,A must have!,"Excellent design and manufacturing quality, it will last a lifetime. Great for camping and ""anywhere"" grilling when you get the new charcoal pan that is now available from the manufacturer (not on Amazon yet). This makes it a stand alone grilling system you can use most anywhere, and it fits in the bag too. I love it, and also have their ""Rebel"" smaller grill system for grilling for two (available from Amazon)."
5,Campfire Grill,This is a must for anyone that camps! Used it several times now and no issues with food rolling off the sides or sticking.
1,Lighthouses and lifesaving are not mentioned.,I believe the book I ordered was about lighthouses and not book of pictures of old homes in Maine.Please let me know if I received the book I ordered.Did anyone read my review!!!! I ordered Lighthouses and Life Saving Along the Massachusetts Coast and you sent me The Kennebunks in season. It is not the book that is terrible but your service!!!!!!Please respond with how you are going to correct your problem.
4,Put a cork in it,"It is just what I expected, a fun wine stopper. I bought them for stocking stuffers. Perfect!"
1,Save your money,"This program is THE most user UNfriendly software I've ever seen. The manual was essentially worthless and skipped many important basic points. The tutorial was un-doable. I eventually tossed it aside in frustration and tried to go it alone with the menus. However, the menus are not intuitive and few buttons have mouseovers to tell you what the icons (some undecipherable) mean. This is an exercise in sheer frustration. Old-fashioned pencil and paper beat this program any day. Save your money."
2,not so good,"my wife, Rachel, used it alot, and i mean alot! she makes lots of choc chip cookies every day after dinner 4 desert. 3 or 4 days later, she told me that something was wrong. it turned out to be the smart mix or whatever it was. it kept taking away power so it burned up the motor. we were about to get another but i decided to get a refund instead. so she bought another and she still has it so i am enjoying her cookies!lol"
3,"Not great, but good","Okay, this is not a great one, but it is certainly a good anthology. Unfortunately, some tales feel slapped together or inserted for name value. The inclusion of Peter Straub's unfinished story is the worst offender. But some of the other well-known authors acquit themselves reasonably well and a couple fresh names (such as up-and-comer Darren Godfrey) are clearly marvelously talented. I guess if I had purchased the hardcover I'd be a little annoyed, but is it worth your time and money in paperback? Sure!"
1,"Deserves zero stars; awful, terrible writing","I have been a lifetime fan of horror fiction, and bought this book hoping to read works by the greatest in the field. Well, if these ""writers"" are the best, God help us all. None of the stories I read were either entertaining or even scary in the slightest. They were, however, drab, depressing, and incredibly vague. The absolute worst was ""In the Window"", about a man who rapes a little boy. The story made me want to go out and find the main character and deal justice on him, instead of frightening me. The other stories were in the same vein. This book is just awful; don't waste your money."
2,sort of a mediocre mystery / soap opera,"Boy, what a disappointment. I was expecting a cool, L.A.-based mystery novel that would be rich in atmosphere and suspense. But what I got was a half-cooked mystery with much, MUCH TOO MUCH, personal love details about the main character (a gay insurance investigator). It all became jumbled, tawdry, and almost comical in a bad way. This book simply didn't work for me on any level.Bottom line: what should have been a slick mystery turned out to be a quasi-homoerotic mess. Not recommended."
2,Disappointing,"I really like his other stuff, but found this to be surprisingly badly done. The singers weren't much nor the songs. I do like an srtist attempting to try really different things, and I like the genre he was examining, but the album just doesn't make it."
4,Some good ideas,I found this book interesting because it helps me to see ways that a crisis can benefit an organization. Hurst pulls together ideas from a number of different places to show that leadership must take on new habits when crisis hits.
1,Pile of Junk,"DO NOT BUY THIS!! This is a warning.. I can't believe they charge 40 bucks for this heap of junk.. Not only can you get a better cd player that plays MP3 files with a better anti skip for the same price or cheaper.. but the cost on batteries is outstanding for this thing. It burns through batteries faster than ANYTHING i've ever seen before.. Two batters last 30 min- 1 1/2 hours in this thing (Name brand.. brand new).. Stay away from it.. save your money.. get something nicer, with MP3 support.. and ofcourse, longer battery lifetime. Keep your eyes out for something that list battery life in the specs.. you always know you're on the right track that way."
4,Good Selections by Another Guitar Virtuoso,"George Benson selected these songs and he is well qualified to do so.A number of them reflect the 'bosa nova' work that Benson himself produced for a time (see his albums ""The George Benson Cookbook"" and ""The Shape of Things to Come"").Very nice fare from top to bottom, with a number of classic works played out on the guitar with great flair.A recommended introduction to the artist."
5,Talib,"Well, I've never heard this cd B/4but I'm sure it's good cd, B/cause this boy was in a great group with alot of talent. I never knew he had a solo cd and that I know I'll buy it."
1,Unauthorized Biography - Tabloid Journalism At Best,"It's really hard to know what is fact and what the author made up when reading this book. As a big fan of Faith's, I'm really sorry I helped pad this guy's pockets by buying this book. He sensationalized episodes in her life to the point that I got totally disgusted with the book. Also, he apparently does not like her husband, Tim McGraw, at all because he certainly spends plenty of time giving a one sided view of the legal troubles for Tim brought about by an overzealous sheriff and his deputies. Keep in mind that this is an unauthorized biography, and Faith was not interviewed for the book. He's trying to sell copies, so therefore, he's bound to stretch the truth repeatedly. In my opinion, he more than stretched it at times, he just made it up as he went along."
5,Proud Contributor!! Thank you James L. Dickerson,"Hello:James L. Dickerson gave me the honour of a lifetime. He included a small contribution of my thoughts in this book about Faith Hill.I bought the book to read it truly from end to end, but not because of my name in it, but for the story of Faith's life and her road to stardom.I thoroughly enjoyed it and found I couldn't put it down once I began. For all of Faith's fans, do yourself a favour and buy this book. You'll be very glad you did. It also makes a wonderful gift for the ""Queen of Country""!!!Thank you James.Diana E. LeBlancMemramcook, NBCanada"
5,"Great Photos, Great Stories, and CHER GREAT OVERALL","This book was great. Going over the life of one of world's favorite people...CHER. The collection of photos and stories of the icon was awesome. I love the book and I can't put it down, cause it's so good."
4,"Cher, the Celebrity","This is a great overview of Cher's Celebrity Career. Lots and lots of great photos. Answers to all the gossipy questions that have been floating around for years! I also purchased the Elton John Scrapbook, and it is much better only because there was a section on his music, describing the songs and circumstances with each of his albums. The Cher Scrapbook could have benefited with a musical section similar to that. Overall, very entertaining."
2,Vendor is selling expired Ink Cartridges,The Cartridges I received are from Puerto Rico and expired in 2005! These are 8 years old! The two I opened are working but for how long?
3,Super light 5-ply wood,"I bought this to compare with 5-ply baltic birch plywood which I purchased earlier. The 1/4 inch poplar is a 5-ply plywood which is great and is substantially lighter weight than the birch. In and of itself, it's great stuff - seems sturdy enough and structurally flat. However, with that said, there were a few small voids in the inner plies which could spell disaster under the wrong circumstances. Also, poplar is very soft (which is why it's so light) so it doesn't make a good alternative to the baltic birch which is denser and by definition should have no voids. But if you're looking for a lightweight, easy to cut, soft plywood, this is the ticket!"
1,Hate the company....,"I ordered the DVD, Star of Midnight, starring William Powell from Italy with the implication I would be able to view the DVD on my TV in the USA. The product was delivered but is not available for viewing on any brand of DVD player I haved tried due to ""region code error"". There is no opportunity to change the region code to make viewing possible. I wasted the time (several weeks shipping time) and money for a product I am not able to use in the USA. I would not order from this company if you live in the USA."
5,Ginger and Bill,"I love any movie with Ginger Rogers in it. William Powell just adds a plus.An old film, but well done. I recommend it."
4,Time Capsule,"This limited edition double-album, released in early 2002 is just perfect for anyone discovering Barbra Streisand for the first time. It's also perfect for the die-hard fan who wants to hear their favorites in remastered form. Spanning more than thirty years, these tracks show an artist who refuses to let time affect the spirit and convicton of her singing. If you've known any of her songs at least by ear, chances are it's here."
5,The Essential Barbra Streisand was Just What I Wanted,The album is a little old a little new. I thoroghly enjoy it and it is just right for singing down the highway. It is a lovely mix of her first music with her new music; it is exquisite. Barbra fans will love it!!
2,AnotherGreatestHitsCollection?Enough Is Enough,"Maybe its not Barbra Streisand's idea to have another Greatest hits package,but her record company.These are hard times for alot of people out there.We want new music,not songs we already have on so many greatest hits CDs from Streisand.The 2 new songs,""Someday My Prince will come,"" and the fantastic,""You'll never walk alone,"" would have been a great single CD to raise money for the children who lost there parents from the tragic events of 9-11.I guess money is the name of the game,but ""Enough is Enough,"" I'm not buying this."
5,Musical Pictures....with Emotion!,"Barbra Streisand has to be one of, if not the greatest voices of the past century and she doesn't seem to be losing her edge! With her interpretations of songs, if you close your eyes, you can see vividly, what she is conveying using her magical fine-tuned instrument! She sings with full emotion in every note! You not only feel it, you see it! Her last two CDs, A Love Like Ours and Christmas Memories, both show she's already making a new stand in the current century! Bravo!"
5,A 40-Year Celebration with Barbra,"""Mem'ries, light the corners of my mind..."" Listening to this 2-CD set brings back so many memories. The heart and soul that Barbra brings to these songs is, of course, equalled by that voice, a rare gift from God. Year after year, note after note, hit after hit. Here we have an unparalleled artist in all her glory. I couldn't begin to single out selections from these 40 songs. I will say the first song on Disc 1 represents a rising phenomenon, and the last song on Disc 2 defines a superstar with a social conscience. And, everything in between is quite magical...with superb remastering. Essential indeed."
4,A beautiful selection.,"This compilation spans throughout her career.I love disc two, the Yentl songs hold a special place in my heart... When Barbara sings you can experience her lyrics, feel what is in her heart."
2,"Same ol' Babs (or ""comin' around again"")","After listening to this album, I feel that one would have to be like the title of her movie (Nuts) to purchase it. This album offers nothing new. Babs, like many entertainers today, is just trying to make a quick buck on material she has already sold to her more than loyal fans. I love Babs, but I expected more."
2,is this the best???,"i'm not really a barbra fan.i haven't kept track of her singing career.but i like her songs.however this album disappointed me.considering this is a double-disc cd and barbra streisand produced it herself.i felt like there were lots of songs missing in this album while a lot of songs should have been taken out from this collection.i'm happy though that her trademark songs like people,the way we were,evergreen,etc,are together in this collection.but where are the other songs that ""made"" her? like:it must be youif i loved youif i couldno matter what happenstwo peopleif i never met youwith one more look at youall of my lifeand many many more???really disappointing.i particularly hate a sleeping bee.when i heard that i said...what is this song doing here???anyways,my point is,i hope some tracks that aren't as superb as the songs i mentioned missing should've been replaced.so this collection for me is a very incomplete compilation of the artist.not an essential collection."
2,OH PULEZZE,"Barbra Striesand is an enigma for me. When she first hit the scene in NY she was a marvelous singer, The albums up to and including PEOPLE were tremendous with a little affectation other than her natural style. Then she went Hollywood and it was all downhill from there. She has the pipes still but she abuses them with such over the top singing that she is totally unlistenable. I am really sorry for the Streisand fans who adore her, but truthfully she stinks. Other than the BROADWAY ALBUM which was a throwback to an earlier style, she sings terrible songs;the worst pap imaginable this side of Tom Jones.I'm sorry but I have Dinah Washington and Ella and Frank on the CD carosel along with Diana Krall and giving this CD to my aunt who adores her, but Aunt Clara please be fowarned put the ear plugs on, the CD transfer is painful."
2,ok,"I was some what dissapointed in this c d. I like her music she belts out, not the very slow kind. I purched it for the song evergreen, as that was my wedding song. Most of the music is very slow and monitoned."
4,May be Essential but certainly not complete.,"You've read all the reviews, you know most of the songs, so just as with Olivia Newton-John's Essential Collection, the next question is always ""Hey, where is ...?"" So here goes... ""Hey where is 'Songbird', 'Superman', 'Eyes of Laura Mars', etc. I always wonder why these Essential Collections do not AT LEAST contain all of the songs originally included in Greatest Hits compilations. For those looking for the few perks of songs ('Someday My Prince Will Come', 'You'll Never Walk Alone') that you may not already have this is a good one. But, c'mon, a TRUE Barbra Streisand fan already has the entire homemade ""Box"" set collecting all of her wonderful CD's throughout the year. This CD does free up some space on the 100 disc player though! :-) Larry"
4,"A very good ""Best Of""... Even when missing some great perfomances of BS!","This compilation is really an ""Essential"" one from the extraordinary Barbra Streisand. However, I would have voted for including her wonderful performance of ""Memory"" from Broadway mega-hit CATS. In spite of that, this collection of BS hits is quite good, the booklet provides very essential information and the sound quality is excellent."
5,MEMORIES MEMORIES MEMORIES,GET RID OF ALL YOUR OTHER CD'S THIS IS THE ONLY ONE TO OWN.... IT COVERS ALL HER OTHER CD'S... SUCH MEMORIES WHAT A GREAT TIME JUST SIT BACK AND LISTEN TO HER VOICE.... HOW IT HAS CHANGED OVER THE YEARS.... THIS IS A MUST OWN.....
3,Workable..,I've had a hard time finding a sun hat online for my infant son and finally settled on this one. This hat (0-6mths) is big for my son and he has a big head for 2mths! I have to tie the velcro ties instead of press them (too much room left for baby's head). No way a newborn could ever wear this. The color came as described: light blue. It's lightweight and non-stuffy; perfect for warm/hot weather. Lots of coverage too-- front and back which is wonderful! I plan to keep this and will continue to use till his head grows into it (also buying addtl. hats that will fit better for now as well).
4,Great sun hat,"I bought this sun hat for my 11 month old and it fits great plus its excellent sun coverage for face, neck and ears. Didn't use the velcro for the face (it was too small). My son didn't try to take it off so its comfortable."
3,Nice cap but some issues,This is a nice cap and worked well for our 2.5 month old while we visited Grand Canyon and Vegas in peak August summer. The cap is good but the clip at the back which is used to tighten the cap sits right behind the babys head. So if you have a baby who cannot raise his head yet or sits in an inclined position on the car seat most of the day then the clip right at the back of the head can be an issue. Otherwise it is a great cap for a good price.
3,okay for price,"i have a hard time keeping my 9 month old in this hat...it is like it blocks his vision or something and he always takes it off. once i get it on his head I have a hard time securing it tight enough that he can't get it off, where as those bucket hats just have the one velcro strap and he can't get that off..not sure what the deal is here. I love the idea of this hat and the shape and color, but it just didn't work for us."
4,Good Sun Hat,This gives me peace of mind knowing that my son's head and neck is protected from harmful uv rays. It sometimes block his view bc it moves around a lil bit but workable. I would buy it again for when he's older.
1,wrong sizes delivered,"I love this product that is why I ordered 4 pcs. 2 pcs to my daughter and another 2 as a gift to friends. Unfortunately I received wrong sizes. On the packaging there was the correct size (6-18 month), but the product itself was smaller (0-6 month).As I ordered the products to Europe it would be too expensive to send them back or order new items. So I am unhappy with this story..."
1,"Where is the hat, anyway and is it made of gold? It must weigh a ton for the price to send it.",I ordered this hat for my new grandson about ten days ago and IT HAS NOT ARRIVED PLus the postage and handling are equal to the price making it way to expensive in my opinion. Wish I knew where it is since it was not at his house for valentines day. I am sad.
4,stayed on baby's head!,"this is the only hat that will stay on my 1 year old's head for longer than 5 seconds. you can adjust the size around the head quite a lot, plus the chin strap is long and sturdy. she tried to pull it off, but couldn't very easily and so gave up trying and forgot about it being on her head most of the time."
4,Works as intended.,"Comfortable, waterproof.....if only my daughter would let us put it on her! It is lightweight, well made, and UV proof. What more could you ask for?"
3,great but runs big!,I loved this hat for my little girl (although she hated it!) :) It was slightly large however. So soft and not stiff at all!
5,It's perfect. This is what you are looking for.,"It fits right, is adjustable, and covers from all angles. That was most important to me. The fact that it looks better than any other baby sun hat I've ever seen was icing on the cake. You're done looking for baby hats - get this one!"
2,OLDER REMASTER,"This is the same remaster that Graham Nash supervised in the early 90's, that is available on the current domestic Atlantic CD.However, as Rhino is just commencing a 2006 reissue/remaster campaign of the entire catalog, it would be a waste of money to buy the current domestic CD,and a double-waste to pay that much more for this import."
1,tear up the intestines,"I have a dachshund in the veterinary hospital after giving him one of these. He chewed the corner of the bone and it splintered and tore up his intestines. I showed the ""rib in a blanket"" to the vet and she was appalled that these are being offered to dogs."
2,for my 300zx,fits perfect. The only thing I hate about it is the 4 little slot holes in the back. Was it really necessary? That drops it down by 3 stars.
1,does not fit 87 toyota pickup,"this product was not even close to fitting in any way in my 87 Toyota pickup, complete bs, do not buy this product unless you are dumb"
1,It's just a hand mixer really.,"I just received this as a gift. I make cakes for people all the time and thought having a second one would cut down on dish washing in between orders. It will not work for me. The beaters don't do all the way to the bottom, and that is what makes the bowl spin. I also have a sunbeam stand mixer and that one works great! This one will be going back to the store and be replaced with something else for sure. I don't want a had mixer that takes up so much space, because that's all I would be able to use it for. The bowl is also 10% smaller then my other stand mixer's bowl. I'm sure this is one of those cases where you get what you paid for......the thought was there, I'm happy my relative tried to help me out as far as my cake business goes, but I wish we could have checked it out of the box before making the purchase."
4,clean/compact design,"the mixer stand is a nice compact size and cuts down on the clutter feeling. it's cute.i used it to cream butter this morning, did a nice job of it.only complaint, i ordered new and was sent an open box item.the manual mentions 'wire beater' and 'twisted wire' attachments, but then says on select models. this isn't the selected model."
2,Just OK,"I bought this at Walmart for $17 last week, just wanted to try a mixer before spending $200 for Kitchenaid. I don't recommend for anyone, but it is little better than a hand mixer. Most of the times you need to lift the bowl so that mixer mixes evenly."
1,Too weak for bread dough,"I have to agree with the review ""Awful"". I recently got this as a gift. Since it came with dough hooks I used it to knead my bread dough. The mixer did a fine job for nearly 5 minutes. Then it started to struggle and smoke started coming out of it.It is nice to have an inexpensive stand mixer, but I wouldn't recommend using it for anything but cake batter. Throw away the dough hooks, they will only kill it."
2,Piece of Junk,"I got this for Christmas a year ago and I was really looking forward to using it because I really like to cook. Wow.. was I ever disappointed. This thing is a piece of junk. The cord gets in the way all the time, you can smell the motor when you've been using it heavily and it's so lightweight, you have to be really careful that it doesn't slide off the counter. Spend the money on a good mixer.. this one just doesn't cut it."
1,Awful,"I loved this thing when I first got it. It did what it was supposed to do, but I burned it out in about two weeks after using it maybe ten times. I only have one speed left(slow) so now it is little more than useless."
2,Disappointed,I bought the mixer as a Christmas gift and I was very disappointed in the quality of the mixer. It is so light weight and flimsy that it does not do a good job with something as simple as a cake mix. The beaters do not touch the bottom of the bowl and you have to keep using a spoon to get it to mix good. Might work ok as a hand mixer but not on the stand. I read all the other reviews and still bought it against my better judgement.
1,hamilton beach mixer,I do not like this mixer. The bowl does not turn. I have to turn it manually. The low speed is not really low. It is definitely a Deluxe mixer. I would rather have a plain old hand mixer than this thing.
3,Good for light duty...,"I bought this mixer with the intent of using it for all mixing needs including batters, cookie doughs and bread doughs mostly because it was basically one of the only ones that I could afford. It is great for cake batters and things you need whipped, like egg whites and creams...you'll have to stir a bit throughout because the beaters don't reach the bottom of the bowl, but mostly that's ok. I tried to make bread dough once and the machine shot a spark, smoke came out and the motor stopped. So, don't use this for any dough that is stiff. The hand mixer is very difficult and awkward to remove from the base, don't even try to do it while it's operating. Nice bowl though, I'm still using it even though the mixer is in the trash."
2,bowl doesn't turn,"I was dissapointed in this mixer because the bowl does not turn while you mix, which to me is the point of having a stand mixer. I didnn't want to spend a lot on an expensive mixer plus most of the large ones do not have a removeable head which I like. But the last mixer of similar quality I owned the bowl would turn while you mix and to me this is an important feature. I am sending it back."
4,My daughter's wish,I bought this for my daughter and she says she really enjoys it. It is easy to use and to clean. It doesn't take up the entire counterspace. I only wish it hadn't come UPS it took longer than I would have liked for it to get to her.
5,Mom loves it.,I brought this for my mom and she loves it. She said it works great. She said the bowl is heavy but that was not a big deal to her. she said it mixed her cake batter thoroughly and completely.
1,Unsatisfied customer.,"I did not rate this product because I am totally dissatisfied with it. When I pushed the button to let the hand mixer down, it flopped and caught my little finger in the hinge and I had 1/4 in. blood blister on my little finger for almost 2 weeks. It was very painful and I had to continue working to make my holiday cookies and cakes. It is no more than a hand mixer on a stand. The hand mixer is too heavy to use alone. The beaters are about an inch from the bottom of the bowl; therefore, you have to continually use a spatula to move the ingredients to make them mix properly. I have a HB hand mixer that is identical to the one that came with the stand mixer but is light weight and I like and use it a lot. The stand mixer did not live up to my expectations. I will return it for a full refund."
2,Okay Blender,The blender had to be shipped back to Hamilton Beach for repairs. We had the blender expire while making cookies. This was only the third time we had used the blender. The previous complaints were avoid similar models and go with a more powerful blender such as the 64695. I would have preferred just purchasing a kitchenaid to start with. Tech support is good - we are awaiting the replacement model.
2,Wasted Money,"I wear myself out scraping down the sides when I use this as a Stand Mixer. I already have a nicer hand mixer. I didn't read reviews ... it was an impulse buy off-line.I'm now shopping for a REAL stand mixer ... this was just wasted money.I give it 2 stars only because of the price here on Amazon, which is MUCH less than what I paid for it."
4,Perfect Mixer for My Needs,"I love to bake, and this mixer has been perfect for my needs. I don't mind scraping the food from the side of the bowl (shouldn't you do that, anyways?) and feed it into the beaters. The price point is great and love that it combines a stand mixer with a hand mixer. I have never had an issue with it sliding across the counter. The beaters are extremely easy to pop out, and mounting and dismounting the mixer into the stand is also really fast once you learn how to do it. I would highly recommend it."
1,Crappy - better to save money for another one,"Hamilton Beach Hand and Stand Mixer - 64695I got this because I wanted a stand mixer for all my baking. However, after just three uses, the motor blew and a burnt smell was wafting through the kitchen. Even when it was working, it did not get to the very bottom and I had to constantly scrape the sides to get the mix down. The rotating feature did not do very well.The time that it blew, I was mixing a double batch of sugar cookies. It could not handle even that soft mix, luckily I never tried to make bread with it....I checked the site and it's hard to even get it serviced because you need the receipt and I did not have that still since it's been over 6 months. I think I will stay away from Hamilton Beach products in the future."
4,"Concise, well-written, informative","This book is fairly short and thus isn't intended to be the definitive book about Jews in Islamicate societies, but nevertheless, the Jews of Islam does provide a good introduction to anyone who wishes to know about the Jews on the other side of the Mediterranean.I wouldn't characterize Lewis as believing that Islam is just an outgrowth of Judaism, but it is true that theologically, Islam and Judaism are very similar. Indeed, the two religions have much more in common with each other than either has with Christianity. The two religions are also share a fusion between faith and law, something that Christianity, due to Paul, does not share.Finally, perhaps what is best about Lewis, aside from his clear style, is his rigid definitions before embarkation. For instance, what is Islam? Islam is the equivalent of Christianity, Christiandom, and secular law."
2,"DJ TIESTO ""MUSICAL JOURNEY"" continues but the visuals of this DVD are no so good work by cameras",This DVD has great music to listen to but the movement of camera's is just too much its not focused on DJ Tiesto or the fan it moves every other second its too damn much so i would recommend not to buy this DVD to be honest with you its not worth itThank you
2,Quite good,"This ""Tisto In Concert"" dvd is great, but.... the first one has been the greatest made. This dvd is very unconfortable because:- The scene edition is very f%&($!%""$&% up xD, jejeje, if you see it, you'll get tired of the eyes, very very unconfortable.- Almost all the tracks mixed in this dvd are from Tisto, I know, I know, this sounds kind of stupid, but when you see a dj, you also want to hear new stuff from other people... Like in the first tiesto in concert, that he only mixed like 8 or 9 songs of him and the others where from someone else, so, you know what type of artist you like.I personaly like the first one... this one is very unconfortable..."
3,A three-hour long music video,"Part A)*The music will fu#@$*g blow your mind.*You will know why people love Tiesto so much (vibrant spirit).*The production is of a grand scale.*I wish I was there, so would you.Part B)*The editing is Schizophrenic (to say the least).*Visually distracting and uncomfortable (you might get sick if you had something to eat earlier).*A three hour long music video.*Try to get your dvd on an MP3 format, if you can, then enjoy the awesome music and throw the dvd away.4.5 stars for the music1.5 stars for scene editing"
3,tiesto in concert 2,well...its a dvd on a DJ performing to a lot of people in a concert lots of lights and they show people having some fun... they dont show you the inside of the club for squat
2,Excellent Mix - Horrible Editing,Watch this with your eyes closed!!! The music is great but the video editing is too fast and out of focus. I could not even finish watching this. Very disappointing. Everybody send an email to Black Hole requesting to re-edit this trash. Please!
5,Excellent a must buy,"I'll be brief, Definitely this production is very different than the first one, same format but much better. I thought that it would be more of the same but this one is a blast... A++++"
1,90% of VIDEO DOES NOT MATCH MUSIC.,"The very Best of the DJ Tiesto REAL LIVE Show is the amazing synchronization between the music and the show (lights, fireworks, etc.) This DVD is TOTALLY unsync; and doesn't make justice to the real thing. The real thing is just amazing. The DVD version is just BAD; VERY BAD. More than disappointed I hate the moment when I made my decision to bought this DVD. REALY BAD !!!"
2,Interesting tracks but poor audio quality,"The tracks are interesting, however the audio quality is rather poor (compared to Tiesto's released CDs). The camera flies around in all kinds of angles making it very distracting and somewhat difficult to watch. I could forgive this if the audio quality was superb, but it simply isn't, so I honestly can't recommend this to anyone."
4,Superb,"Amazing production, fantastic track selection, horrible editing. Fantastic 3+ hours of euphoric trance. Break out the pills...."
5,The Gold Standard,"Ella is the gold standard for all female singers. She has the range of a classical singer, the soul of a blues singer, and the improvisational skills and phrasing of a jazz artist. If you want to begin a lifelong love affair with this great artist, this CD is the place to start."
5,Mighty Macs.,Movie was very good and uplifting and shows what a person can do by going after a dream and putting your heart and soul into it. We really like movies that are based on a true life story.
3,Just a review,"The movie was really good, but the connection speed was awfull to watch it with.That is all I have to say."
5,Worth watching Mighty Macs,"Great story of perseverance in the face of huge obstacles such as lack of funding, lack of interest from community. Portrayal of stay-at-home wives a bit overdone. Delightful touches of humor."
5,Feel Good Movie,Always heard and read the story of the Immaculata College Mighty Macs NCAA National Championship. It was well done as this is based on a true story and I know it was panned by some critics. Not sure what they were reviewing. But this is a wonderful movie for the whole family to see. If your a coach for any sport get the your team to watch this movie. It will pump you up!
4,Great movie,"A kid I coached had a small bit part in this movie, but my real motivation was because I grew up going to Cathy Rush camps.. and love her."
5,Great Movie!,Inspirational with comedy thrown in for a bonus. A heartwarming true story of perseverence and determination. Good for the whole family.
5,cinco estrellas muito bem!!!,"i watch this over and over, its a phenominal performance by a leading star of brasil, ivette sangalo. fabulous crowd participation and great and energetic performances by those on stage. an absolute must see with special guests performing alongside ivette throughout the entire show, including daniella mercury, magareth menezes, gilberto gil, etc.. i encourage everyone to watch this who is interested in brasil music and musicians. i cant say enough, i enjoy this so much"
5,if you like ivete sangalo this is a must have!,"A superb dvd in every way.It really is an amazing show id say a visual delight It is professionally filmed and includes all her hits and is full of high energy, glamour,and spectacular outfits - you'll feel that youre a member of the audience.A must buy!!"
2,Hated it,"Honestly, I could not wait until I finished reading this book. And it wasn't because it was really good; it was mostly because I found it horrible. I mean the main character Jan puts herself down because her best friend is named an ""It Girl"" in this major magazine but she walks around thinking that she's pretty much irresistible to all guys. When I got to the end, I was pretty much not surprised by the ending. I mean don't get me wrong, some of the stuff in this novel was actually pretty funny but I just couldn't stand how one moment she would be conceited and have these out of the world scenes play in her mind and then the next minute she's thinks she's better than everyone else. Jan's character seems so one dimensional. Her best friend and her love interest seem to have more depth. Personally I didn't really like the novel but maybe it's just me? Anyway overall I give this novel 2.5 out of 5 paws."
5,I looooved this book!,Confessions of a Not-It Girl was a REALLY good book. I loved the story and sometimes I was even laughing out loud! It's a REALLY good book! Read it!
4,One of my favorites!!!!,"I love this book. Throughout the book you will hit slow sopts, like in most books. But it's great. The ending is well worth the wait. I recommend this book for people 13 and over. There are some things that go on in this book, that I don't believe are for everyone's eyes to read. But if you're a teenager you will totally relate to this book, and love it. You'll jump up for joy when you are done reading it."
2,Thank you... try again,"Even though I think I am well beyond the years of reading teenage drama queen books... AMAZON recommended this book to me, so I thought why not give it a try. There were a few lines or thoughts that were funny, but it didn't pull me away from the fact that this is your average teen book... (You know where the girl has this huge crush on a guy and she is just waiting the entire novel to see if he feels the same...) The ending was too pretty and predictable for my taste.... but then again like I said I don't think this book was written for me. Hopefully, like Jennifer Hubert said, Kantor will do better in the future."
3,"Good writing style...cliche, uninspired plot.","Melissa Kantor writes well. She is clever and sarcastic. But the book's plot is pretty weak, and the ending is about as cliche as you can get.I think if Melissa Kantor tackles the world of twenty-to-thirty-something characters, she will do well, especially if she adds a few interesting subplots and/or turns of events.All in all, it was a decent teen novel -- I'd have given it 4 stars if I was still a teen myself (I'm 29)."
4,"An excellent work, even WITH maddeningly small pictures !!!!","M. Higaonna's work is a high quality technical manual of an Okinawan Martial Art known as Goju-ryu Kara-te. Higaonna's book is one of a VERY few which are of sufficent quality that it COULD temporarily assist a practitioner (or someone merely curious re: Gojuryu Karate's technique (of a very popular exercise: Sanchin Kata) until a teacher can be found. The ONLY problem with the book is two fold. 90% of the book is photos, postage stamp sized photos ! Publishing Insanity !!! Secondly, the book is written in english, and yet at CRITICAL points in its description slips into Japanese. Un-necessary & poorly planned in this readers opinion."
4,Good book!,"I have read this book, it definitely helps for making rapid application with Designer 2000 as match with the title and helpful for the beginners. I am looking forward for similar book for Designer V.2.1.1"
5,nice 4 shot side saddle,"I ordered this a few days ago for my Mossberg 500 field/security shotgun. I opted for the 4 shot side saddle over the 6 shot for reduced weight and because I didn't want to have to modify the forend to be able to fit the 6 shot on there. It went on super easy. The directions weren't as clear to me as they apparently were to some of the other reviewers, but I figured it out quickly and had it installed in less than 10 minutes. The longest part was finding a socket and nut driver to tighten up the nut at the last step. All in all, it was a very easy process. I think one reviewer marked it down because he said that having it on there slightly hinders your ability to quickly find the action release switch above the trigger. I don't know how that could happen unless you mount it upside down because it's no where close to interfering on mine. I'm happy with my purchase."
4,a ittle tight,Have this installe don my mossberg 500 it was a little tight at first but after removing ammo and reloading in them a few times they lossen up to make it easier.
2,Incomplete,"Side saddle came very fast and I was very excited to install it. One big problem though, it came with none of the hardware, just the saddle itself. After finding out that it would need to be removed for every cleaning, I'm kinda glad I wasn't able to install it. Just get a buttstock shell holder from Allen company and save $20+ dollars."
3,Missing part,The nut sent with the 10-32 bolt was too small.. Now I'm stuck with tracking one down. Not a big deal but still its annoying when you pay for something new that doesn't come with all of the right parts
3,wrong nut with unit,Had to call Lyman to get the correct 10-32 nut sent. an 8-32 was in the package and it would not fit the through bolt for the Mossberg 500. long wait on the phone with Lyman. they are supposd to send the correct nut
1,no mounting screws,"came with directions as well as side saddle, but no mounting hardware, very disapointing. Obviously should have them in the package but none were included."
4,Perfect fit on Moss 500,"Arrived quickly, priced great, install was a breeze and feels sturdy as hell! Other people have recommended 5 or 6 shell carriers, but I feel they may interfere with overall shooting/handling. Would repurchase."
2,A Smart Girl's Guide to Boys,"My daughter is 11, but having skipped a couple grades, she is in 8th grade with 13 and 14 year olds. Most everything in the book I have already taught her or she has discussed with me as topics around school among her peers. This topic and book needs updating to real world circumstances."
1,WHAT KINDS OF STANDARDS FOR OUR GIRLS?,"This book made its way into our ten-year-old's backpack - apparently given to her by a pair of older girls.Are we the only parents to believe that this type of material is completely inappropriate for young girls? What kind of standards are we suggesting - that kissing and boyfriends are appropriate at this age? How many parents have to parent teenage mothers before someone takes a stand for wholesome and meaningful content and role modeling?We have as strong a relationship as parents could have with their children. We take the time to eat dinner together, engage in family activities like hiking together, so we may be considered the exception to the rule. It's hard to believe that no one else feels as we do: that the material contained in this book is for early teens, not younger - and at minimum as one other poster said, be read with your daughter.You decide."
5,Great Book,"I'm 12 and i think this is a great book for ages 10 and up. (Some say 7 and up, but I don't think 7 year-old's crushes are that ""intense"" and they don't really have boyfriends.) But anyway, I'm just telling what age group this book should really be."
5,appropriate information,My then 10 year old daughter wanted this book long before I felt she was old enough. I allowed my sister to purchase the book from the American Girl Chicago store since she was visiting the city and give it to my daughter for her 11th birthday. It has good information to keep my daughter happy without too much information. American Girl has a good way of addressing issues for girls without giving information that is best coming from parents. Another great AG publication. I think we have them all!
5,My girl would not put it down!,"I have an excellent 2-way communication with my daughter, especially when it comes to boy talk. Nevertheless, I believe it is not a bad idea at all for her to hear and consider what others have to say. It may make it a lot less uncomfortable for other moms and daughters to refer to this book and have someone else bring up a situation...I highly recommend it!"
5,the Best,I have owned this book for years.........and decided to give it to my son as a gift because he roams Arizona. He was so thrilled with the book and its contents.It's incomparable for historic Arizona research.
4,Great little magnets,"These magnets were strong despite their small size. There is a little ""magnet dust"" on them, but nothing that a quick wipe with a damp paper towel can't take care of. I have had these for a couple of years now and they still work great."
3,Sound is good but the hiss just gets irritating,"This is my first surround sound system and I was impressed with the quality of the sound. However, there is a very annoying hiss that the speakers create which gets very irritating. Especially when you are watching a movie and there is a silent scene, the hiss really starts to bother you."
2,didn't last,"Like others that have reviewed this. I have the same speaker set, and while they started off fine, soon developed a hiss, and other noise issues. Now the center channel and sub don't work at all."
2,"Started off good, but didn't last","I got a good deal on these at Fry's over a year ago and enjoyed them immensely until just recently. At first they sounded great but have in the past few weeks developed a crackling noise from the center and front left speakers. I produce music and need something better, that will last. You may fare better, but I'm going to be looking elsewhere next, perhaps Klipsch."
4,Soaring Excellence,"This is a very thorough book on an amazing architect. Calatrava is a highly original architect and most of his work is nothing short of breathtaking. The photography in this book really captures the magic of his sculptures. That is what his buildings really are; great works of art. This book covers his work in detail and the text is informative. I appreciated that a model of the station at the World Trade Center site is included, one really hopes it gets build just as designed. I highly recommend this book to anyone intersted in great architecture, this man is a singular talent."
3,Decent treatment of purchasing practises and theory.,"Easy to read, shamefully out of date in terms of technology, great overview of basics...best suitable for operations/supply chain novices. Totally American focused and centred."
3,Okay,These were not as sharp as I had hoped. They are better for indoor pruning or light outdoor pruning.
3,Watch out,"These shears clip stems fine, but the orange safety slide doesn't work, and the blades open up when not in use. I've tried putting a rubber band around the handles to keep them together, and that usually helps. But I wouldn't have bought these shears if I'd known about the safety problem."
5,Fiskar Bypass,"Received it in good time, it's doing the job it's made for. I would order another one, but not at this time since I have a new one on hand. Thanks Tom"
1,Probably used one,"It looks like we had received used one. Since it is just pruner, did not bother to return or contact customer care."
1,Doesn't Work With Mac; Junky Headset,Instructions says it works with Mac but it doesn't. No drivers; not even on manufacturer site. Tried the headset and it is absolute junk. Can't say anything more about the base unit as I never got that far.
2,buyer beware-2 floyd songs & irrelevant filler,"i guess the interviews are relevant, by the fact that they are indeed from the 60's. that's about it. you get to hear julie christie, michael caine, david hockney, and jagger talk about their feelings. i knew that the floyd performed only two songs, but i did expect to see 'the floyd' during these performances. it's more like a music video, with occasional shots of the band. a time capsule of history i agree, but if you're going to release a dvd and call it a 'pink floyd' dvd, have more than 28 and a half minutes of the band (shown sporadically), and some meaningless interviews to round it out to an hour. just another example of using the 'pink floyd' name to sell a dvd. should have known better when 'rolling stone' gave it a good review. 2 stars cause it's syd barrett even if you don't get to see very much of him. (or the rest of the band for that matter) very disappointing."
1,Copyright,This game was & is a complete ripoff off Dragonball. The show got canceled & and creators got sued. Why own a game like this anyway.
4,Kids love it,My children have this game and love to play it. My neice likes to barrow it. So I am going to get it for her for Christmas.My son would play it for hours if I let him. He is playing it as I write this.
5,Extemely enjoyable. Something new to the gospel scene,I have enjoyed this CD ememcely. It's is so refreshing to finally here something new and innovative in the gosple world. He brings a new flava to gospel that everyone should experience. His latin beats help the spirit move within you.
4,Great !,"I bought the CD to replace my worn-out cassette tape, and I was pleased to find it has one more track -- Adelaide's Lament -- which I enjoyed. Nice to have another comic song to balance out the love songs. She brings out the beauty of these lovely tunes."
4,An Original Broadway Diva,"Check out the harmonica on the smooth ""Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man"". Stevie Wonder does the honors, as Streisand's lovely voice caresses the lyrics. Another good one is ""Putting It Together"" which is interpersed with her frustrations at convincing others to get behind her making an album. Very nice collection of songs."
2,Insipid & Disappointing,This album was especially disappointing since I have been a Streisand fan for many years. I still recall how electrifying her early albums were in the 60s. I played them so much I wore them out. On this album Barbara gives a lackluster performance. She goes through the motions but any emotion is gone. One gets the sense that she is just doing a job to make money and all the passion and love for her work are gone. She just does not get into the songs the way she did when she was younger. This current album is all technique but the spark is gone. It actually sounds more like elevator music than something you would intentionally listen to. The arrangements are insipid and she seems to misunderstand the meaning of the lyrics. The selection from West Side Story comes across like an upbeat children's lullaby. Barbara is just out of synch with the composers' intentions. In this album she blew it and the whole experience is disappointing.
3,That's entertainment.,"The girl has talent! Not a sing-a-long unless you're as talented as she is. Anyway, it's fun to listen to while you're driving."
3,Pretty Good But Short,"I liked this cd pretty good. Barbra's vocals are great, the song selection is great, but the album seems to be a tad short maybe I'm use to those longer albums afterall this album was rleased when albums were not as long anyway back in the 80's when vinyl was the way to release music. I gave it three stars because even though its great its not her very best album.But I do reccommend it. Its a good album."
5,Broadway album,Loved this ! Nobody can do Broadway songs like Barbara. It has songs we have loved for years and now my grand daughter has discovered her music and i bought this for her.
1,"THIS CD HAS THE RIGHT VOICE, BUT THE WRONG SONGS.....","I have many Barbra cds and have enjoyed them a lot over the years. This particular cd is not one of my favorites. Let me explain! Why in the world artists try to record songs that most people don't rally like or enjoy is a mystery to me. This time Barbra recorded a lot of fairly new hits from broadway, but these songs are not what i would call the ""back bone"" of broadway. They don't have the strong melodys that the older songs have. I wish Barbra would record the big hits of thePorters, Berlins, Rodgers', and Kerns. These songs really have good melody lines.Recommendation: I can not recommend this cd."
1,DON'T get it,"Barbabra Steesand is way overrated, she dosn't have the chops nor the emotion to sing good standards, and she doesn't know how to pick songs either, I just can't get into this, or any streisandd"
1,"Amateur music, amateur ensemble, excellent singer","I'm not sure this music deserves a CD: not interesting, often boring, it's a second class repertoire. Anyway, it could be interesting, but the ensemble doesn't help: ""ill-tempered cello"", harpsichord without phantasy, honest fiddlers. The solo harpsichord pieces are a tribute to boredom.But - Roberta Invernizzi is a very good singer, always ""intonata"", deeply expressive. I suggest to look for CDs of this intelligent Italian singer (I own Neapolitan music with Capella di Turchini, quite good), but not this.If you want to discover new musics, try this CD - if you want music for your ears, avoid. it."
5,INDOOR GRILL,LOVED IT. EVERYTHING IT SAID IT WAS. GREAT COOKING STEAKS. JUST LIKE AN OUTDOOR GRILL ONLY FOR INSIDE ON THE COUNTER!
2,DON'T BUY IF YOU WANT LADIES WATCH!!!,"Ridiculously large....wish I'd paid more attention to the reviews. Was looking for a waterproof watch to wear snorkeling/swimming on vacation, this is NOT IT!!!"
1,Didn't like,"I bought this and wore for 2 weeks...it's really flashy and FAKE looking...it looks really inexpensive, or VERY young, something teenagers would wear. I ended up going and buying a GUESS men's watch with no crystals and I love it! I would suggest this watch to anyone who loves bling and flashy..."
1,Horrible looking watch,"Looks like it should belong on Jay Z or Snoop Doggy dog, disgusting watch,Flavor flav wouldnt even wear this watch."
3,Too big!,"This is a beautiful watch, but if you have a small wrist, it is HUGE. Had to return it because of the size. If you like the oversized look, you will love this watch."
4,little big but nice,yes the watch is a little larger than other watches but once i got it altered and wore it omg!! its really really nice... i loved the packing... it comes in a very nice pouch... i;m in love with it
3,HUGE watch,I guess if thats what style you want then its good but defiantly too big for me or my mom. returned it no problem.
4,BIG WATCH BUT WORTH THE PRICE,"I was looking for a silver that would suite my style until I came upon this watch. I didn't realize how huge this watch is, this watch is not a womans watch its a unisex watch. The face is very big and heavy and it doesn't fit a small wrist and it has to be adjusted. The watch is pretty don't get me wrong but I'm a little disappointed with my purchase."
5,"can't take the eyes off it!!!,","this is a beautiful watch, I love it! and really, people can't take the eyes off it...it is incredibly nice! CAUTION, if you're petite this may look very big, as it is bigger than it seems to be in the picture, but it surely is a great buy!"
3,Probably wouldn't have purchased if I could have seen it in person,"From someone who prefers large faced watches, I can vouch that this watch IS indeed large; not only the face but the band too. The appearance borders masculine. I think I will like it better during cooler weather when paired with sweaters and long sleeve shirts. It's a decent watch--just be prepared for the size b/c it really resembles a man's watch in that respect. If I had seen this watch locally, I doubt I would have purchased it for the $109 price. Also, I had to have approx 3 links removed by a jeweler to get a good fit; I have small wrists."
5,Guess Watch,I ordered the watch as a gift. It looked exactly as pictured and the receipient of the watch loved it.
4,Beautful Watch,"The watch is beautiful. Bought it as a Birthday gift to someone. I only wish it came in a hard case box and not in a pouch. Other than that, the watch looks very nice!"
4,Aus Crawl Greatest Hits,"This is a great CD, it contains all their top hits and more,and is very rare now. This item is no longer available in Australia."
5,The Conclusion,"This second box set is at least as well done as the first, although the plot isn't quite as compelling as in Vol. 1. The end also seemed a little hasty, but that certainly wasn't enough to drag down such an incredible series..."
3,Japanese opening/ending credits?,"hi,can anyone who own this let me know if it has the Japanese opening/ending credits? how about the Japanese title cards? thanks"
4,Death Note Box Set 2,This was bought to give as a gift.It has not been given yet.So I have no idea if it is great or not.
5,Light continues to slip into darkness,"I was very pleased with the quality of the box set. The packaging is solid and the performance of the disc's is of high quality. I watch my anime on a PS3. If you know the story, Light will continue his path into the abyss of darkness. In my opinion, the second set is by far the most exciting and has many surprises. This is one of the best anime series I have ever watched and I know you will enjoy it."
4,Awesome DVD,"I got both Box Set 1 and 2 for my boyfriend for christmas, and we absolutely love it! The qaulity is wonderful and it is in English as well as Japanese, so you don't have to read subtitles =] If you are looking for a great storyline and easy to watch anime, I definitely suggest DeathNote =]"
5,Great ending to a masterpiece,"Death Note is one of my favorite animes, it's genius as far as I'm concerned. Some may say that the story isn't as good in this volume because of certain characters dying and being replaced, but I feel like it still maintained the quality of excellence that started in volume 1. Bottom line, if you're a fan of anime, or even just a fan of psychological thrillers, check out Death Note immediately."
5,A great ending to a great series,"I won't spoil anything with this comment (other than that this is the final season of Death Note). Death Note came on the air when Bleach was taking a break to dub the Japanese version. I was upset when Bleach went off and didn't want anything to do with this new ""Death Note."" I decided to watch since there was nothing else on TV at 11pm on Saturdays. This show is very interesting, and disturbing in its own way. It makes you think whether killing bad people is a sin or a heroic deed.This season starts out slow (after the time skip, which should've been the real start of this season) but then it gets back on track like season one. The end is interesting (but kind of obvious). The show is a little violent for younger audiences (especially the finale) but is a MUST-SEE for anyone who thinks they can handle a psychological thriller of a show."
5,perfect,This product was in perfect condition. Couldn't ask for a better quality item. Not a single thing wrong with it.
5,DeathNote 2 - Enjoy it!,"At this point, the storyline keeps me going. I can tell though the creator tried to milk it a little. It's still entertaining and you can only imagine the what Light Yagami is going to experience as the story concludes."
5,Impressive as always,"The Death Note season 2 box set is a great way to complete the Death Note collection. Although the special features on the last disc aren't anything particularly exciting, they are amusing at times. They're only a bonus, anyway. The real reason to buy this is to complete one of the best and most faithful animes around."
5,Great Beginner Book,The goaltender is the most neglected position on the hockey team. The rationale may be coaches not knowing where to start. Patrick Roys' former mentor Francois Allaire offers a structured program that takes away the guess work involved. The coach follows the program in progression with a purpose instead of just keeping the goalies busy or having them face a barrage of unproductive shots.
1,Poor,I am so glad that you contacted me about my recent order. Until this point in time I have been satisfied with all of purchases from your company. This time the CD's that I ordered for my preschool class are of poor quality. This one skips and has a huge oval marking on the back side of it where it is obviously damaged. The Disney disk also skips. My book the Busy Spider is so tiny my kids can not see the pictures. Very poor quality and misleading information from your company is making me rethink my opinion of buying online. I will in the future purchase from on site only.Thank you the opportunity to vent.Linda Ross
5,Great book,My sister recommended this book and I was uncertain as to how helpful it would be. I am so thankful I listened to her and bought it. It's helpful yet practical. I'm glad I bought it.
2,"Dad, If you only knew",A light weight reminder of important things a growing daughter needs to see in and feel from her Dad.
5,Creative and extremely intuitive about the period,"The Alchemist is a wonderful novel with insite into the 16th Century. It brings you to another dimension in time and takes you on a roller coaster ride through the period. The turmoil of these times is deeply felt and makes you appreciate the true essence of Life. It reminds you of what Giordano Bruno went through when speaking up for what he believed during a time when certain truths were unspeakable. Surfice it to say, ""I thought this book was inspirational, to say the least."" Take a chance and experience a reading adventure!"
3,Good funtional pilllow but.....,Have never been able to compress it down to size it was when delivered. No way to adjust firmness like you can with Thermorest pads.
5,SWEET SO SWEET,AWESOME IS THE ESSENCE OF THIS PRODUCT. NOTHING COMPARES TO HOW IT MAKES MY HAIR FEEL WITH JUST A DAB. THIS IS VERY SILKY SMOOTH.
5,Basics in Folk Art & Tole by Joyce Howard,"As a fan of Joyce Howard's art work, I was very pleased to find this book. It is in great condition and a great addition to my collection of her works.Unlike many of the painting books published today, there is very little color instruction in the book; however, the 7 patterns contained within are well worth the price."
2,"Good Product, Poor Shipping","The dash kit was exactly what I needed, it fit perfectly and seems to be holding quite well, despite the fact that it arrived pretty beat up. the plastic tabs were bent and the mounting holes were almost fallen off. I used it anyway because I didn't want to go through the hastle of returning it and waiting for a new one to arrive. I would give the Product a 4 star rating, but the seller a 1. If you can find somewhere else to find it, I'd say go for it."
5,Saturn Din Mount,I purchashed this dash kit to convert the factory 2 din mounted stereo to a single din set up. The fit was spot on and it was very easy to install. Highly recommended.
5,"The Pan is Spectacular. Tough, easy-to-clean, and cooks consistently.","I have been looking for non-stick frying pans that utilize cast aluminum. If you've ever cooked with cast aluminum, you'll agree with me that it's the only way to cook. On top of that, it's difficult to find frying pans with glass lids and plastic handles. Other items I've looked at expect you to cover the pan with a dinner plate while holding the handle with an oven mitt.I was in heaven when I found these and am in heaven when I'm cooking. No burnt food. No weird hotspots. No sticking. No burnt hands when pouring out grease. And no peeling teflon. Then I found out about the lifetime warranty.Need I say more???"
4,giant hammock!,"the hammock is huge. I just need to get used to it, its the lay sideways across kind."
1,monster bike mens standard,"Fun, novel, attention getting bike. Cheap hardware put together with indeifferance. That sums it up, dont buy this unless you are handy. I love it, its fun, but it required a bit of work to make it usuable, and some reinvention to make ""OK"". Im a large guy, and it suits me, kids love and its like being a bike celebrity on the bike path. Everything but the frame needed to be tightened or replaced with better parts. Its a very expensive piece for what you get, however, no one else makes a frame or wheels anything like it. Be prepared to love/hate it."
1,not much here,"I was mostly disappointed in this small phamplet. This 30 page book of use and maintenance, half dedicated to chainsaws, spends two of them on sharpenening chainsaw blades, and the author actually reveals that he's never gotten the ""courage"" to attempt to sharpen his own.If you are an experienced sawsman looking for those little extra maintenance pointers and hints, you won't find them here.If you have never picked up an axe or chainsaw, ask a buddy for help."
5,axes and chainsaws,"This booklet starts out with a bit of a history lesson. It then goes on to talk about the care and uses of axes, and of both bow and chain type of saws. There is even a chapter on how to safely fell a tree."
2,This is really a lodging/dining guide to 12 semi-random cities,"As an avid endurance athlete myself I was hoping this book would capture the ""soul"" of the 12 marathons presented in this book. For the Boston marathon, for example, the author captures none of the excitement when seeing the Citgo sign for the first time, the deafening cheers as you pass Wellesly College, and being treated like a celebrity all weekend.The author shares little to none of her personal account with the 12 marathons covered in this book. Indeed the author herself claims she has only run 7 marathons and doesn't mention which of the 12 she's personally experienced.This book is more of a sterile dining/lodging guide to 12 semi-random cities rather than a book about 12 marathon experiences."
3,"Good, but different!","I hate to admit it, but I have to somewhat agree with staticwithabeat, who reviewed this album as a one star album. After many 6 hour car trips, I've decided it seems as though there's less work put into the music in this album, it almost feels raw in some ways. The album is not as dark as their other two. If this sounds like what you're looking for, more power to you. Just don't expect to get another album like Music for the Jilted Generation or The Fat of the Land. The album is a very different style for Prodigy. Personally, I tend to listen to the other two albums more often."
1,Are these the same guys who made Fat of the Land????,"This album is so horribly repetitive and uncool, it just makes me sick. It's just the same thing over and over again - ultra-fast, scrambly drum loop and squeaky, cartoonish sound samples and vocals.When I heard the song 'Charly', I got about 1 minute into the song before I couldn't stand it any longer and had to take the CD out of the tray. This is possibly the worst song of any type I have ever listened to.There are a few listenable songs on the first CD, the second CD is not even worth keeping as a coaster - Pop it into the microwave the first chance you get.I would recommend avoiding this CD. Buy Fat of the Land (great album), and leave it at that. If you absolutely can't get enough of Prodigy, then get Music for the Jilted Generation (decent album). Prodigy has some great songs, but they sure aren't here. Don't listen to these other reviews - This is one experience you'll want to pass on."
2,ZZZZZZZZZZZZ,"Been there, done that. But unfortunately this is the reality of today's music and today's gullible consumer (myself included). Bands lightly remix their stuff, mostly just dragging it out to seven minutes as opposed to just four, package it up and ship it out. So much for originality and creativeness. To quote the Who, ""I won't get fooled again."""
1,Are these the same guys who made Fat of the Land????,"This album is so horribly repetitive and uncool, it just makes me sick. It's just the same thing over and over again - ultra-fast, scrambly drum loop and squeaky, cartoonish sound samples and vocals.When I heard the song 'Charly', I wanted to put a gun in my mouth - Prodigy at it's lowest.There are a few listenable songs on the first CD, the second CD is not even worth keeping as a coaster - Pop it into the microwave the first chance you get.I would recommend avoiding this CD. Buy Fat of the Land (great album), and leave it at that. If you can't get enough of Prodigy, then get Music for the Jilted Generation (good album). Prodigy has some great songs, but they sure as hell aren't here. Don't listen to these other reviews - This is one experience you'll want to pass on."
4,RE-RELEASE OF THE PRODIGY'S FIRST ALBUM WITH BONUS CD,"This is The Prodigy's first album, originally released in 1992. So, it's bound to sound different to those of you used to Fat of the Land. The bonus CD features remixes and tracks that are available on the singles, so if you have been an avid follower of The Prodigy from the begginning and have the singles (like me) then you would have no reason to buy this. However, if you lack the singles, and/or you do not have the Experience album, then this is a must buy. I give this four stars because, at the end of the day, it's a fantastic album, and the bonus CD is a must-have for anyone who has only just jumped onto the Prodigy bandwagon."
3,Buy Experience first,"The Prodigy's Experience cd was released in 1992, and was a GREAT album, however, the expanded half of this cd is not as great, although there may be some ""rare"" remixes on cd 2, they are still not impressive. Fat of The Land fans most likely wouldn't like this cd, because up until Music For The Jilted Generation (another unreal cd), The Prodigy was good. Then Fat of The Land came around, and well, although Laim put out some intense, driving and complex beats and kicks, it was too main stream. (Not to put down good old Laim, from 91' til' 95, maybe 96, he put out some great stuff, he was a skilled artist, and still is). So, go buy Experience, and Jilted Gen., and any other of their early singles first, it well be worth Your money"
5,White Mountain Boots Are The Best,The quality and comfort of the boots were excellent. Usually when you get a pair of boots you have to break them in or they hurt your feet for the first couple of times. I do a lot of walking and these boots felt great from the moment I put them on.
4,Good stuff,If you like the blues and you like hearing an electric guitar rip it up playing the blues than you should buy this album.
5,A Must Read For ANYONE Wanting to Succeed in NW Marketing,Network Marketing For Dummies is loaded with great information. Dr. John Hayes Ph.D has written 17 books on sales and marketing and is an industry expert on franchising.75% of the Fortune 100 Companies utilize Zig Ziglar's sales and motivational training and Zig has trained over One Million Network Marketers.Network Marketing is known as The People's Franchise and don't forget the *M* Word...Marketing. Putting Dr. John Hayes and Zig Ziglar together in this book makes it a winner.James Davis featured in Upline Journal's 4-98 issue
4,A lot of good information!,"Zig Ziglar has out done himself once again in coming out with this great book on Network Marketing. I am a great fan of Zig's sales and motivational tools and this book is no exception. The book covers an in-depth look at compensation plans, handling customers, being a leader, etc. The only true flaw is that this book lacks the insight on informing new recruits of the MLM pitfalls they are bound to encounter. It also skips over the exact ""how-to""'s of handling objections and doing presentations. Plus this book is not ""simple"" enough or easy to ""duplicate"" for the new recruit. It's just too long!. If you're looking for a book that covers the essentials of ""how"" to succeed in MLM, may I suggest: ""Your First Year in Network Markting"" by Mark and Rene Reid Yarnell, instead.Bottom Line: Don't get me wrong, this is a great book for people who want to know about Network Marketing, and with just a little fine tuning, would be the best book ever!.I hope this was helpful to you."
2,A Book That Teaches One To Sell,"Albeit the fact that Zig Ziglar's own MLM bit the dust, this book is great for those who would like to learn how to retail their MLM products.Also this book does NOT cover much about the pitfalls one is bound to encounter in network marketing.James LeongAuthor of ""MLM Persuasion Mastery:How Master Networkers Change Beliefsand Behavior"""
5,"Excitement, Thrilling & Informative!!","D.L.Tanner's ""Track of the Bigfoot"" is the one to get!This book is one of the best buys in years for me. The character development is superb!Cryptids are the beasts Cryptozoologist seek out, hidden animals we've all heard about, may fear, but still many of us wish to someday encounter.I must thank Jerry D. Coleman's ""Strange Highways"" non-fiction Cryptozoology / Paranormal book for getting me hooked on this stuff and so glad I then picked up ""Track of the Bigfoot""!Great book Mr. Tanner, a roller coaster read of excitement!"
2,"Good idea, needs finess","I love anything Cryptid so had to give this book a shot. I really enjoyed the story line but that wasn't enough. The main character was just irritating. How could such a wimp decide to hunt for Cryptids? My biggest peeve is the authors insistence that I cannot remember what I read a few pages before. I don't need a constant reminder that someone is a 'conspiracy theorist' or any of the other often repeated phrases from this book. This book has potential, it just isn't there yet."
5,Beats jogging,"This is my first rebounder so I can't compare with others on the market. However, as an engineer I can report that the quality of the product is first class. Google ""EWOT"" (exercising with oxygen therapy), buy a rebounder and an oxygen concentrator and prepare to be dazzled with immediate results. Fifteen minutes at 10 liters/min. is all it takes to transform your health."
2,Karaoke Box Set Disappointing,I just received my box set and really expected to have the graphics since it said CD+Graphics on the cover. Nothing plays on my computer which means I can't use this at church. Where is the information regarding what this product actually is? I was hoping to help our praise team since we don't have instruments right now but don't think this will work. Here's the warning.
2,Why are there vocals?,Hello. I was not expecting to hear vocals throughout the entire song since this is supposed to be a karaoke cd. Am I doing something wrong?
2,disappointing.,I ordered these disks to add some Christian music to my karaoke collection. The song selection was very good and so was the quality of the music. I was very disappointed to find there were voices on almost every track. I sent them back and received a prompt refund.
5,Required Reading in Psychology Courses,"WALLED IN, by Robert Connor, was a very interesting read, particularly from a psychological perspective. The group dynamics of this ""fanatical"" organization, including mind control techniques such as superiority to the rest of the world (as relates to their ""infallible"" position), peer pressure, and fear of ""eternal damnation"", are common to many ""cults"" who choose to withdraw from main stream society to follow a charismatic leader.For the author to be able to write such an insightful biography after such an upbringing, and to self-motivate through the toughest schools in the country following his departure from ""Saint Benedict's Center"" is a tribute to the human ability to transcend the certain eventuality of the fires of hell to pursue such materialist goals.Submitted by Barney Fife's brother."
5,great party album,"Purchased this double CD set shortly after it came out - have listened to it quite often. Like the series ""Just the Best,"" these are a great series of songs from various artists popular in Europe. Great mix of styles, artists, and sounds. New stuff, remakes of old favorites, almost everything on it is great. Wish these songs would hit the charts here in the States. Great for a party, or just listening to on your own. Highly recommended for anyone who is tired of listening to the ""same old, same old"" on the radio."
4,"Bright, helpful insights","Everyone who is the parent of a girl or who was once a girl herself--or who simply wishes girls well--can gain insights from this intelligent book. Author Deborah O'Keefe is a fine role model for little girls who want to grow into accomplishment. She provides readers with an entertaining, solid, and useful survey of books written for girls: She explores the ways that these books teach girls how to behave and think. In the past, the subtle (and not so subtle) messages of books for girls usually tried to persuade little girls to grow into compliant women who accepted second-class citizenship. The good news is that more recent books often provide girls with role models who encourage them to grow up to be fully realized, first-class citizens. Another benefit of this book is that it can sharpen our awareness of the hidden messages in any book we read and of the impact books have on who we are."
2,"Elizabeth, Jane and Jo are still models for us all","This book was a boring rehash of half-baked so-called feminist literary perspective, which insults great women writers of the past and discourages anything like dissent in women writers today. If Deborah O'Keefe lives to be 100, she will never be worth the dust on Jane Austin's shoes or the frill on Charlotte Bronte's petticoat or the ink on Lousia Alcott's apron. Elizabeth Bennet, Jane Eyre and Jo March are smart, strong, and morally good. I suspect it is the last of these qualities that upsets Ms. O'Keefe. Why is it that some people find the idea of being ""good"" so threatening? For most of us, being good is a virtue to be admired in both girls and boys. As for reading, check out the article by Gina Dalfong ""Where Has Jane Eyre Gone?"" in the June 25 Weekly Standard. By the way, I was a charter subscriber to Ms. Magazine but dropped it because the fiction was so dreadful..."
1,Makes a great doorstop,"The reason I gave this book 1 star is because there is nothing smaller. The CD contains the same stuff you can download from Borland's web site. In fact, the book is a compilation of help screens, tutorials, and published sample applications. Borland's help is obscure at best. Taking the SAME data and putting it in print doesn't make it clear, just heavy. My particular interest was in their implementation of OpenGL. The description says ""discover the latest in multi-media techniques with OpenGL"". One paragraph that mentions two examples on the CD rom (The same two examples that you get for free with the eval version).Don't waste your money."
1,Having several difficulties reading this book,I am reading through this book and have experienced the followingissues:1. The CD does not contain the examples that the authorrefers to in the book. Chapter 2 refers to a debugexample on the CD and Chapter 3 refers to a DragDropproject. Both these projects do not exist on the CD. I hadto stop and write a review at this point where I am onlyin Chapter 3... 2. Many sections in the book are not organized and leavethe reader totally confused. Chapter 3 explains aboutframes... I had to skip that section as I could notunderstand anything. A constructive example would bemuch better.I am somewhat disappointed with the publisherDaniel
4,Wonderful illustration,I would not suggest this book for informational content. I would definately suggest it if you are looking for some great examples of Art Deco and how you can use Deco pieces in an interior. This book has fabulous illustrations.
2,Art deco by Young Mi Kim,"Book is great but was delivered scratched beyond acceptable conditions for used book. Was authorised to return it, but shipment cost is worthless. So I just keep it as it is!"
3,Simple & Helpful,"This is a simple little book that introduces mental and spiritual practices athat one can apply in your daily life for a variety of issues. Even if you don't experience profound changes in your life condition, you will know an improved feeling about life. The teachings provided help one to experience a greater sense of control. This is a nice little book, be you a newbie to such things or an experienced ritualist. It does not require you to join some coven or temple, but provides the tool you need for an enhanced experience of life."
2,Basic occult manual on simple mental spells.,"Universal Mind is a simple book that goes over simple occult principles and explains topics like reading your future from dominos, playing cards, talking to people in their dreams, color healing, healthy eating, and a few other topics. Nothing ground breaking, but still a nice little book for people interested in occult aspects."
2,Much too american for the Canadian Social Worker,"I purchased this very expensive, yet thin paperback text for a social policy University course. The book is well written, but the perspectives are so American that I question the usefulness for a Canadian student of the subject.The text is certainly updated, including a lot of glowing statistics about work-for-welfare programmes. The authors also use the words ""unwed mother"" and ""Out of wedlock"". These terms were thankfully exiled from the common social work language about 20 years ago, on this side of the border.Oh yes and let's not forget the glowing stats,for abstinence- only sex education. Don't get me wrong there are lots of perspectives offered in the text but I'm accustomed to social work texts which approach material from a Social Work values perspective, which does not usually give a lot of ink to conservatives."
4,Fact and Fiction,"2006: The Chautauqua Rising is an interesting mix of fact and fiction. Al Gore is projected into the White House and many characters are thinly veiled public figures. This was cleverly written as a ""who-done-it"" and romantic thriller, but the author did a magnificent job focusing on some important personal rights issues of our day that could evolve into much more serious issues by the year 2006. Independents and libertarians will love this book."
1,Yet another must read for the the right wing fringe,"If you liked the Turner Diaries and Hunter, check this one out. At least Cashill knows sentence structure if nothing else. Yet another in the redneck, racist, ""Oh my God, the liberals are ruining our nation"" genre. Simplistic, predictable and well worth skipping."
5,"Fascinating, informative, hightly readable and entertaining.","John Butler has presented a fascinating, informative, highly readable, and entertaining story of the rise and fall of the American Merchant Marine. While written from the perspective of an insider, the author never talks down to the reader, nor overwhelms the reader with needless detail. He presents the material in a calm and even-handed way, and hold the reader's attention throughout."
4,This is a history book,"This is one of the more comprehensive narratives on the US Merchant Marine. It is particularly interesiting in its detail on the East Coast origins of the craft. It also tells the sad story of communist involvement in the maritime unions that lead to the virtual demise of American international maritime shipping, and its eventual outsourcing."
1,Train Wreck,"This book is very disturbing on so many levels. As satire I would have rated it 5 stars, but since it obviously reflects (perceived) real life experiences, it reads as an autobiographical case study in psychopathology. This book is worth reading for insights into narcissism and self-delusion. I didn't know whether to laugh or cry, or maybe both. I hope this was a cathartic experience for Mr. Mills. For me, it was like watching a train wreck, only with very bad poetry. If you want to feel better about your own life, read this book."
5,"Wierd little anime... But oh, so cute!","I had heard of Battle Athletes Toshoyden before, (Original Japanese name) way back in 1996,but have never seen it.I have to say it was well worth the wait, although I found it a bit wierd for them to be using a Saturn IV launch vehicle in the 50th century.My only disapointment was that the discs only contain a meazly 2 episodes per disc. This could have been a much better series if they had crammed all 6 episodes onto one disc. This would have been a little more {money}, but far less of a waste.If nothing else, I reccomend these discs for the beauty of the anime alone.I found a lot of Star Trek , The Outer Limits, and a whole lot of Tenchi in here. All and all, a great little anime!"
5,A light-hearted anime with a twist...,"The last in the OVA series Battle Athletes, Go!, provided both the much anticipated conclusion of the Cosmic Beauty Competition and the answers to some of the problems presented in the first two installments. The story centers around Akari and her chums as they compete for the most coveted of all titles, Cosmic Beauty ooooo...eeee...aaaaah. By this time it's really down to three contestants, Akari, Kris(her friend) and Lahrri(the defending champ). There are some twists and turns mainly involving the religion involved with athletics and the (...lets say tense) relationship between Kris, Lahrri and the evil Mylandah. The ending is fitting for the series and is actually very unexpected, well it was for me anyway. It gets 5 shiny gold stars!"
4,"Great OVA, excellent english dub","This is a fun athletic theme ova that presents a lot of the characters who can be seen in the tv series ""Battle Athletes Victory"". This series does have some situations that are inappropriate for children, but otherwise is very entertaining. This ova only shows one segment of the battle athletes story. If you want the entire story spread over 26 episodes, seeBattle Athletes Victory, Vol. 1: TrainingBattle Athletes Victory #2: Doubt and ConflictBattle Athletes Victory #3: Tragedy & TriumphBattle Athletes Victory, Vol. 4: Spaceward Ho!Battle Athletes Victory, Vol. 5: No Looking BackBattle Athletes Victory, Vol. 6: WillpowerBattle Athletes Victory, Vol. 7: The Last DanceBattle Athletes Victory, Vol. 8: Human Race."
2,Nice for a while,"Its nice until the paint begins to wear off and yellow residue is all over your pants, shirt, furniture and just anywhere with 20 feet of this thing. I would not buy again. Comfortable but thats all it had going for it."
4,Let This One Grow On You -- It's Beautiful.,"On the latest Trailer Bride release, Melissa Swingle leads her band on a midnight ride across a moonlit plain. Swingle is a talented multi-instrumentalist and songwriter who can spin a fine yarn (""Jesco""), break open a heart (""Bird Feet Feelings""), and paint an evocative picture (""Wilderness"").Her appealing melodies are delivered in a unique country style, often with a cartoonish lilt to her voice - like she's shrugging off both the pain and humor in her lyrics. And it's perfectly hitched to some fine musicianship, well-produced but keeping some raw edges. Moody without being dirgy, High Seas makes you want to keep riding 'til the sun comes up.(A version of this review was published in Venus Zine. These words are owned by their author and posted here legally.)"
5,Great Book,This was a real good book. Can't wait for the Fourth Book Kiss the Night Goodbye. Keep up the good work.
4,garlic roaster review,"The garlic roaster is exactly what I expected. It is easy to use and the garlic turns out wonderfully. The only downfall I can see is that if you purchase heads of garlic that are too large, they will not fit neatly into the roaster."
5,Doctor for real,"This book will never be out dated. Whatever changes there are to mankind or their golfing equipment,John Jacobs covers all contingencies. I refer to this 'Bible' when I am in trouble on the course. Simple and effective."
4,The Stone Rolls Away,"The last in the triumvirate of Mott's classic glitter rock albums, ""Hoople"" finds the boys near the top of their game. Although missing the higher number of standouts found on ""Mott"" and ""All The Young Dudes,"" tracks such as ""Crash Street Kidds,"" the Watt's sung ""Born Late '58"" rock-out sideways. ""Roll Away The Stone,"" and ""Marionette"" suffer only from excessive production; Hunter knew this was the end, and wanted to make every track resonate like a cabaret version of ""Rock 'n' Roll Suicide."""
4,A Simpler Time,"Back before rock music got boring, bands of the Glam era made some interesting albums. Ian Hunter and his ""Hoople"" were at the forefront."
5,No wonder it was game of the year!,"This will keep you glued to the computer screen. There's just something about this game that keeps your interest. Perhaps it's the feeling that you run threw one, continueous world. The fact that there is actually a storyline that you can fallow threw until the end. The ""what will happen next"" feeling really keeps you going in this game. Unlike it's other shoot-em-up counterparts (Quake, for instance), this will keep your interest because you aren't playing levels, your playing a world."
4,A Debut Worth Noting.,"David Francis has written a stark, beautifully textured novel reminiscent of Cormac McCarthy. His understated and minimilist prose masterfully conveys his characters emotions with grace and humanity. A simple, haunting story of loss, love, and family."
3,Needs better packaging.,"When I got this the clips on the top were broken, it was packaged very loosely, it would have helped if it was in a smaller box, and packaged better. But used a little super glue and fixed it. Fits great in a 94 silverado."
2,1994 Chevy Dash Kit,"The piece fits as promised but the color is a little off. Not that bad. I don't even notice it anymore. The vents are not as good as the original ones. They remain in the down facing position all the time. If you adjust them to blow upwards, they just fall back down."
2,Dash kit,"Did not receive vents for the dash kit or clips. Vents are shown in the picture but did not arive with the kit. Most kits all have clips to install them, this kit had no clips"
2,Nice,"This is a very nice product. Was easy to install. Disappointed that it didnt come with the air vents, as it appears to in the picture, which is the only reason im giving this such a low rating."
3,Metra 99-3000G Dash Kit For Chevy/GMc 88-94 (Gray),"The dash kit fits the slots available in my '94 Chevy Silverado Pickup. The slot available for the after market stereo is perfect for the cage on my Sony XPlod. I rated it 3 starts because it just doesn't feel that secure to me. The top clips fit snuggly but the bottom doesn't have a clip. It is just a straight piece of the molding that fits in the bottom slot of the dash board. If I were trying to rip myself off all I would have to do is life up hard and it would pop out. I fixed it by buying a plastic molding anchor, but the product should have come with this piece instead of me having to purchase it after the fact."
2,This video should be titled....,"""We Pirated a Few Exhibitions from the 80's and Passed it off as a Video"" They basically pasted together some exhibitions from competitions and the Champions on Ice tour and sold it as a video. It's like finding an old tape in the attic with some mediocre skating on it. If you're into nostalgia for the 80's though, you might enjoy this tape. However, its definitley over-priced."
4,Nice Video !,I have been into figure skating for years now and always try to catch anything I can find on TV. This video is loaded with some seriously good skating and Katarina was beautiful. The quality of the video and sound is very good.
1,Waste of Money,"Video production was a D minus quality in terms of lighting, sound, focusing. The skaters were good but the focusing was blurred in many instances and there were few close-ups. Don't waste your money."
4,Really nice blend of fast and slow titles,"A REALLY nice addition to any collection and if you like this type of music, by all means GET THIS!The only reason it is not a 5 is because I ""ruined"" myself by listening to his best of CD too much! :) If you have ""best of"" then by all means get this, if you don't - get that CD, see if you like his style - THEN get this one!The first two songs are what it is all about:Birdsong is a fast flirty ride - just like a bird flying - you can almost feel it! while ""Distant thunder"" is the perfect blend of styles - very slow and sweeping that makes him perfect to listen to!I would say this is a worthy addition to your collection.Jim"
3,The book was okay,"I just finished reading this book. At first I thought it was really good, but I found it harder to get into towards the end. It seemed to drag on awhile, but overall it was good and had a lot of good stuff on themes. If you have to do a book report, this would be a good book to do it on."
5,great family music,"Today's music has to much cussing and violence their songs have meaning such as ""A random act of Senseless Kindness"" and I enjoy listening to the music when I am going to sleep it is relaxing and fun to listen to such as ""Uncle Hickory's General Store"" G"
5,Absolutely Terriffic!!!!!!!!!!!!,"These guys are very talented. Their CD is outstanding. It brings a new look into Country, but with that old country twist. The guys are really HOT too!!! If you are a true country fan, I recomend it 100%."
5,The Greatest CD and Boy Band I have ever heard in my life!,"This is my favorite CD. I got it for my birthday and I don't listen to anything else except 98degrees. But SSF is my favorite! If any of you guys are reading this, I want you to know that I think I am your biggest fan and have been ever since I heard the song ""Randon Act..."" My VERY fave song is ""I'm there"" or ""Uncle Henry's General Store"" that is cool too. I love you guys and this CD!!!!!!!"
5,"Finally, a group to take Alabama's place (Someday)","We love these guys! Their first video out on CMT ""A Random Act of Senseless Kindness is a smash with all the country fans we know in Oklahoma City. The message is so topical and heart-warming for these scary days...hopefully the good message will spread. SSS sings their hearts out, and that's what we want. Keep up the good work! More videos, more music, please!"
1,GREAT MUSIC,"Yeah, great music if all of your taste is in your mouth. I have a hard time telling these guys musically apart from N'sync. I'm sure they think they're the next Oak Ridge Boys though. This watered down, overproduced Nashville sound is getting a little hackneyed. Just cruise through the country music hall of fame if you need some musical ideas. If that's not possible do the next best thing a just buy a Robbie Fulks CD."
3,The Other Woman's Life is Greener?,"Terrified, Sharon escapes from her abusive husband and finds a new home in Seattle. Her sense of security is soon shattered by shadowy figures lurking in the dark, eerie phone calls, and a series of near fatal mishaps. Although not a white knuckle thriller, Another Life is an engaging mystery."
3,Not a bad yolk nor an omelette...,"Here's a pretty cool old-school RPG adventure with some decent 3D action thrown in for good measure. It's not as good as, say, Square Soft's offerings on Playstation, but it's pretty good nonetheless. E.G.G. offers a unique quest with 3D battle sequences, and it remains a treat to play, even if it gets a little boring in parts. Don't be thrown off by its weird name or its old-school 2-D appearance, because you'll find plenty to enjoy here if RPG is your thing. It'll get slaughtered the second Time Stalkers and Eternal Arkadia arrive, though...old-school can only last so long. At least the Easter Bunny didn't show up anywhere in the game. Pretty good stuff."
3,umm,If you are in real need of a role playing game there you go.Otherwise there are better out there on the 16 bit Nintendo the game looks great the story lacked the hooks to pull me into the game and some of the areas in the game where very how do i put this GRRR! The bosses looked awesome i'll give them a 5.The reviveing enemys was GRR! I guess what i'm saying is buy it ONLY if u really need a role playing game to hold u over untill a better one comes along...won't be a long wait i'll tell you that.
3,Alot Better Than Expected,"E.G.G. is a pretty decent game. This is the first RPG that I have played for Dreamcast, and I am for the most part satisfied. The graphics are good, not exceptional, but good. The game play is terrific for a playstation, but I expected a little more out of the dreamcast after all the hype. If you are looking for a good solid RPG for the dreamcast I suggest you check it out."
1,Waste of Money,i bought this game because ign gave it 8/10. I ill now think twice before buying on thier reviews. The Control in this game is the worst i have ever seen. The art is so-so. the sprite animation is pure crap. save your money don't buy this game
1,This game is stupid!,"Not only has this game have a stupid name, but the story line is stupid too. I just can't get into a game where you play I guy wondering around in an EGG shaped armor suit. The graphics weren't all that impressive. Needless to say I played the game for a few hours hoping it would get better, which it didn't, and now it just sitting collecting dust."
1,what a waste,I saw this on a TV show that was rating eyelash curlers and bought it. I feel so silly. What an absolute waste of money. It's at Goodwill now
1,poor quality,"The eyelash curler would not anchor down, I tried all sorts of angles to get it to anchor down so that it would heat - no luck. I then tried to hold it down but couldn't tell when it was hot enough or too hot. After trying for a week, it quit working completely - I sent it back. This is very expensive for a tool that is junk."
2,Heated Evelash Curling System,This did not curl my lashes like I thought. My lashes are stiff and this item did not work at all.
5,Great case,"I really like this case. This is the first case I've bought for my iPhone and the only reason I bought it is for the headphone storage. But the rubbery material is nice to make it easier to hold my phone. The headphone storage is great. It does add to the width, but shouldn't that be expected? I still have no problem comfortably keeping it in my pocket. Most buttons are easy to access though the silence switch is a little more trouble. As others mention it won't fit in the dock with the case (is there any case that would fit in the dock? The iPhone fits in so snugly, I doubt it.) This isn't a problem for me, I just plug the phone in without the dock. Some might want to use the dock to stand up the phone so this issue might be an annoyance."
4,Good idea...,"The iphone is a pretty darn expensive cell phone, and it requires more than the usual protective case in my opinion. This ""jam jacket"" provides a cushioned shell for the iphone, and is made of pretty strong rubber material. It protects the phone from making contact with the ground if you drop it. The corners are especially strong.Is this fool proof? No, but I'd MUCH rather have this case on my iphone if I dropped it."
4,"Cool case, love the cable management","I have an old 1G iPhone and I've been looking around for a few years for a good case. This case is great! It's very modern looking and provides moderate protection for your device. The coolest part is the cable managment. I always have my earbuds with me, as I use my iPhone as my primary iPod as well. When I'm done listening to music it's nice to have a convenient compact place to store my earbuds and cables. It's a tad bit bulky, but overall I'm pleased with my new case."
2,Design flaws,"At first I really dug this case. It's got the holder for the ear phones, it's got a good grip so that it doesn't slip out of pockets and such but as time went on I found the case very frustrating. I noticed that I was having problems with my cheek setting off buttons while on calls. I thought it was a phone flaw but when I took the phone into Apple they actually said it was the case. Because the case covers the top portion of the phone near the light sensors as the case loses it's elasticity that sensor gets covered and the phone doesn't realize it's up to your ear and the screen doesn't lock.So...kuddos for the headphone holder but a pain in terms of phone usage."
3,could be better,The one very annoying problem with this jacket is it somehow presses the mute button while talking. Other than that it is ok.
2,1 month of use,a better design would have included a reinforced opening for the volume control--this part ripped on me after a month of use. now i have to buy another case.
1,Does not fit 1G or 2G,"On the screen this case looks like it will work. However .. BE AWARE. I have a 1G and 2G and This case DOES NOT fit either of them correctly.The case is very very thin and does not fit snugly. It is very loose and almost falls off on it's own. I would return it, but it will cost me almost as much in shipping as it did to purchase."
2,Kinda Useless,"I was hugely disappointed upon seeing this protective cover. It really isn't protective and is somwhat flimsy. The picture looks much nicer than it really is in person.The cable management is a pre-fabricated rubber loop that sorta looks like the cable loop on your vacuum (but much smaller). I haven't used it but I guess it does the job its supposed to. However, it takes alot of space and my iphone doesn't stay in my holster now. I'm tempted to cut the darn thing off. This is definitely not a keeper."
2,very poor cutouts and awkward cable management,"Keep looking; there's better out there. It's a basic rubber jacket with no frills. It covers the front-facing camera and makes that unusable. The cutouts are off by too large a margin - either the wrong size cutouts or misaligned with the phone controls. The mold to wrap and hold wired earbuds is just silly. Firstly, only the original Apple ear buds fit properly. Secondly, the wires and buds are not protected from snagging or kinking. I'm going to return this purchase. Ceap price for low quality. This time, you get what you pay for."
2,cover with a bump,The back has a rubber bump to wind the cord of the ear piece around. Gets caught up on things so it's kinda annoying.
2,poor voice quality results,The voice quality deteriorates as a result of using this case cover on my iPhone. I am not satisfied with the purchase.
4,Worked fine,This product works fine. It holds headphones as long as they are one specific style... Ive dropped my ipod a couple times with it and had no problems.
3,meh.,"I love the way my iPod fits, looks and feels. I just wish the slot for headphones could actually hold headphones. The slot is a tad too small and the ear bud part of my brand new SkullCandy headphones came off. On the bright the bright side, I cant loose my iPod and the channel fits the cable still works for wrapping the cables. Def worth the $4."
4,Not Advised for 3gs but advised for everything else,"I got the case for my sister and my father who both have the iphone. My sister has the 3gs and my dad has the 3g. It works just fine on the 3g, but on the 3gs it covers up the sensor that disabled buttons on the screen if the phone is up to your ear, and your cheek can hit buttons which can mute the call or hang up on you. If you get for the 3gs be prepared to cut out a little slot so that the sensor can detect your face to disable the touch screen."
3,Seems to be an inferior copy of a Jam Jacket,"I ordered this case and I have to say that while it does look like a Jam Jacket (even down to the little ""DLO"" logo) I suspect that it is actually a knock off copy of the real product.The silicone in this case is a bit looser than what I have seen before and the cut outs for the openings are a bit off center from where they should be. All in all it would probably be worth the extra $$$ to order the real thing in a sealed retail package from DLO."
4,Not for 3GS but still love it!,This is not for the 3GS. Since they moved the sleep sensors the cover covers up the main sensor so when you put your face up to it the phone doesnt sleep while talking. I do love it and hoe they redesign it soon.
4,Great Case,"I bought this case because my friend had it, and I totally loved it.Pro's:______1. Amazing grip around phone2. Provides protection.3. Headphones Never Tangled.Con's_____1. About a week after use with the headphone managment, My headphones got stuck..and when I finally got them out, the case tore my headphone in half.2. Grippy area around phone screen is very flimsy.3. Lint GRABBER. (I find myself cleaning the case twice a week)For 8 bucks,it's a good case.Provided the protection I need,and it's extremly durable."
2,I pass...,"First off...I love The Residents, but never seen them on video before, so i was so excited about this being my first dvd of them.I was a little bit dissapointed, not by the show itself, nor the music, nor the interpretation or the sound quality, but for the takes. It was shot in the stage, while the band is playing (ok, an original idea, but the whole show?) so it gets a little pain to watch it and not get the idea of not seen anything. Just Don't like it.For sure i will buy another of their DVDs soon, i know they are a lot better. But for my, this was a waste."
2,Not very Norse,"This book is okay for someone not into Asatru or wanting to study Norse magick. The author concentrates too heavily on ""tree-hugging"" concepts and there is too much comparison to Oriental and Native American traditions. If you want a book on Runes from someone who knows, I suggest ""Runelore"" by Edred Thorsson."
1,Sone parts are just so WRONG,"Every time he talked about ""Native American runes"" I had to laugh. There's no such thing! I'll rely on the other reviewer for what is wrong about Meadows' view of Norse runes, but for the native ones Meadows is just making it completely up. Call this book fantasy or fiction for those parts dealing with native beliefs, because he sure should not be taken for the truth there."
2,OK product,I thought this would be an animated movie of the stories of the Prophets but it's just children telling the story which makes it much less attractive & doesn't retain the attention of young children.
1,Too shallow,"This book is very small and inflated with pictures of colorful aquarium fishes that have nothing to do with the subject. The most important, it covers only FRESHWATER live foods and while it does give you a brief description of culturing techniques I am sure it will leave you asking for more details. I strongly recommend another book, ""Culturing Live Foods"" by Michael R. Hellweg that gives ten times more information and covers both freshwater and saltwater organisms, different culturing techniques for the same food (basic and advanced, better and worse) and is real pleasure to read. As for this book, it's a likely candidate to become a fire starter for my fireplace next winter."
2,Just about enough informantion,If you are new to live fish food culture then this one is a good introduction to their culture.
1,Basic Foods.,"I felt that this book was ,altogether, too basic. It discussed only the most coomon food sources for a hobbyist. I was left wanting for more. It is a very small, very limited resource. It does discuss how to culture a few types of live foods, but I have found the same information in several other aquarium books, in their fish food sections. Your better off buying an aquarium encyclopedia, with a section on live foods."
1,"Great Music, Record Company Ripping Of Artist","Like the last reviewer, I agree this album has great music and is worthy of listening. But what isn't obvious is what is behind the release of this music. A few years ago the record label abruptly cancelled Cracker's recording contract. Now that same record company that turned it's back on this great band is trying to cash in on Cracker's loyal following. In great Cracker fashion, the band released it's own Greatest Hits album the same day. It's called Cracker Greatest Hits Redux and the proceeds of this album don't go in the pockets of the greedy recording company. If you like Cracker and want a compilation, buy Garage d'Or or Greatest Hits Redux."
2,Booo... Virgin Records!!!!!,"As Jason Kellner said, this collection is pointless. Only the die-hards that already have the originals can tell the difference between these and ""Redux"". And with a fine previous compilation like ""Garage D'Or"", what WOULD be the point? Perhaps the shameless milking of a band that Virgin Records didn't see fit to promote properly to begin with? As an average Joe, would you rather see Virgin get your dime than the artist? If you must choose, buy ""Redux"". PEACE!!!"
2,Redundant and Unnecessary,"If you want a Cracker ""Greatest Hits"", get Garage D'Or instead.If you're a big fan and want to support the band, get ""Greatest Hits Redux"".BTW, word is that a new album is coming this summer."
1,Don't buy this album!,"Buy Cracker's greatest hits redux, available on amazon or crakersoul.comthe newly redone versions of the songs are excellent, the six string is crisp, the guitarwork is amazing. These songs sound excellent reworked after years of touring. support the ARTIST!"
2,If onl I could get this into my beloved cat...,"This may well be a miracle product, but who knows as I cannot get my FIV+ fuzzy guy to touch any food that has this on it. There's no way to even sneak the tiniest amount into him...so...will never know if it works or not. Darn. Expensive lesson."
5,Recieved quickly,We recieved this product very quickly and love it! My cats don't mind at all that it's added in their food.
5,Wonderful Sunday school material.,I teach our adult class of mixed ages and gender. We have been using Twelve Extraordinary Women: and enjoying it very much. I would recommend this wonderful book for any small group study. Not only is it very informitve but also generates excelent group discussion.
5,Extraordinary Book !!,"This book has taught me so much about women of the Bible, a subject that is rarely touched on in the Church. It reminds us that behind every great man there was a great woman to teach. I have given several programs in our study groups using this book. I highly recommend it."
1,Not ecumenical,"Several of us bought this book for a women's bible study. Our group is made up of many denominations and we celebrate our ecumenical fellowship. We have studied Beth Moore and other authors with great success. This book, however, was very offensive to our Catholic audience. There is no way in knowing the experience the author has had with the Catholic Church, or where he is getting his facts but it is not a true or favorible translation. His opinions were offensive and incorrect, especially the chapter on Mary. It surpised all of us that such prejudices still exist in the Christian genre, but we quickly found out they do. Thanks to Lifeway Christian Bookstore, we were able to return all the books purchased and start over with something more ecumenically friendly."
5,12 extraordinary women,This is a book were studing in Sunday school and its a great book on the women in the Bible
2,MacArthur's bias is clear,"From the moment I discovered that he had crammed the lives of Mary and Martha into a single chapter, I knew much mischief was afoot. Cannot the Mother of God be given her own chapter? Was her life truly that second rate?Or, can this be chalked up to the common Protestant approach to the discussion of Mary... don't. It will sound too, too, Catholic. Ewwww!I once read a book by an elderly and faithful Evangelical who opined that he cannot ever recall hearing a sermon on the Blessed Virgin in all of his decades of worship. I guess this embarrassing and insulting phenomenon is alive and well in the Evanelical book writing world too.What a crying shame."
5,wisdom...,"I'm still reading it...and we have a group, here in Dominican Republic, for studying it...We have found so much wisdom and integrity on how the author interpret some stories of God...This have been amazing for my life, and for my spiritual maturity...Blessings!"
2,Women of the Bible are always worth studying.,"John MacArthur presents women of the Bible in an easy-to-ready manner and I appreciate the depth of each presentation. However, our group of ladies was critical thinkers and if there were instances when speculation occurred on the author's part or if he interpreted the Scripture with a certain slant, we were able to compare those thoughts against the Word and determine for ourselves what the Truth truly was/is. A book can guide, as did ""12 Extraordinary Women"", but the Bible still is the ultimate study guide. The Bible is where life-changing verses can penetrate the heart and change lives."
3,from male point of view,"This is a great book! John MacArthur is a wonderful well researched author. I'm learning a lot about the women of the Bible. As an FYI it is written by a man with a man's persepctive. As a woman there were moments it was hard to connect. Not at the top of my list for a woman's Bible study, but still well worth buying."
1,Very Disappointing,"I have led numerous Bible studies, and this book has been a real disappointment. The writing lacks balance, is often disorganized, and even has an ""anti-women"" tone to it. I find myself having to work all week to plan our study, to supplement what he's written. I would not recommend this book."
5,"Twelve Extraordinary Women: How God Shaped Women of the Bible, and what He Wants to Do with You","This book is well written and looks at the lives of these 12 women. The author has delved into their backgound, the times surrounding their life, and why these women were so extraordinary. He shows us how these women were women of faith in God, what principals they lived by, and how we can certainly look to them as an example of Godly women."
1,Not recommended,"This book is COMPLETELY based on opinion. I would not recommend it to anyone. In the chapter on Mary the author goes into a completely unnecessary rant about Catholicism, which I found incredibly offensive. It seems the author just wishes to push his closed minded agenda with this book, which is really unfortunate as I was looking so forward to reading it."
2,A Decent Start on Women of the Bible,"MacArthur's book is suitable for light reading and simple discussion. However, I would not suggest this book if you are looking for a deeper and in-depth study concerning the theology of women. MacArthur is well accepted and intellectual no doubt, but this book failed to reach its potential. Little historical background, cultural context, or word studies of scripture are taken into consideration to support his views. The mere fact that he only lists two sources weakens his liability on such a heavy topic."
1,Anti-female slant,"I teach an adult Sunday school class of varied ages and backgrounds. We had wanted to study the women of the Bible. I looked in a variety of places for such a book, and was pleased to find this one, which seemed to take a scholarly view of the topic. Not so. We find this book hopelessly chauvinistic. But worse, the author does no real research into the women he selected; he simply gives us his interpretation of what little information exists in scripture. In the chapter on Mary (mother of Jesus) he totally ignores Mary's development as a true follower of her son, and instead goes into a rant about the Catholic worship of Mary. I will say that the book has provoked a lot of critical thinking on our part, because we are so angered by the author's version that we are forced to scrutinize the scripture for evidence to build our own view of each woman."
4,Excellent Book,I was looking for the book 12 ordinary men and came upon this. I love books on cd so I can listen while I drive. It was an excellent book and I learned a lot about the strengths and weaknesses of the women of the bible. I would highly recommend it. I have been sharing it with my friends.
4,Twelve Extraordinary Women,A women's study group that I was attending used this book to show different attributes of women of the Bible and how they aren't so different from women today. We face some of the same issues.
4,Super looking pitcher,"This is a great looking pitcher. I've heard that this line of products chips easily, but I haven't had any problem so far."
3,Nice product with porcelain defects,"Everything is good, except that I have found some porcelain defects on the surface: couple of red/black dots not matching the color pattern."
3,Excellent Serving Piece,"Even though the dinnerware has received bad reviews, I bought a few serving/entertainment pieces from the Napoli line. Perhaps because I don't use them every day my opinion is different. They look great and serve my only purpose, which is to display food at the dinner table and the occasional dinner party. I have had no problems with the entertainment pieces. I take really good care of them knowing they are so fragile. I bought them because they truly look beautiful and knew ahead of time they would be used occasionally."
4,ghost writer rocks my socks,ghost writer is my 3rd favourite tv show with futurama and the simpsons. i like watching them solve clews. i give it a 4 because some epsiodes are boring but the magority are good. i espsaily like the one where thay try to get into a comic book and have their comic adventure with stoopdude.-kiran ps you cant find the last 2 epsidoeds of the sieries the other epsiodes cost 395$. sorry for all the mispels
3,Ghostwriter's Youngest,"The DVD is amazing. I've watched episodes from ""Who Burned Down Brinker's Store"" to ""The Slime Monster"" each day for the past three months and have yet to get sick of them. Sure enough, I haven't been doing my homework (I'm getting a D in geometry :) ) but my sleuthing skills have increased tenfold. Anyway this message is just to touch base with all you other Ghostwriter youngster fans. Unbelievable? Believe it.-Sally"
3,Good Intermediate commentary,Martin's commentary on the Thessalonian letters is decent. He accounts for the background situation as it intersects the text as well as structural elements without boring the reader. The thing I like is that this presentation is different from other commentaries on Thessalonians. Pastors and Bible students will find this an enjoyable and helpful commentary.
5,Should cost more,This is a must read. I cannot imagine anyone not getting some valuable wisdom from this book. Should sell for WAY MORE!
2,Promo piece for their other business - in a nutshell.,"This book gives you basic info on how to conduct business - that's available gratis. Chapter 7 was a major dissapointment. If they weren't willing to share their secrets, then why write a book? Oh, I know...because there's more...an insidious way of promoting their ""other"" company.Nice try, but I can see right thru this weak marketing effort.I returned my book to Borders. Keep your receipt, as you will be dissapointed with their banal Ginsuism."
1,There is no wisdom in Ginsu,Save your money - look for wisdom elsewhere. This book was a thorough disappointment. But wait there's more...no there isn't.
4,This Is IT!,"Dream... what else, that hasn't been said, is there to say about Dream? This Is Me is a great song! I recommend it to anybody! This single is what you will want to listen to over and over and over...again. You've heard the song probably so you know what this is and that it's what you want. Personally, 'This Is Me' or the remixes are one of the best pop songs off the moment! So be sure to get Dream's single OR album. Both sound awesome!"
4,This Maxi Single Needs Work!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Well I Love The Dream Song This Is Me, But It's Not On This Single, But It's Cool Cause I Have The Whole Dream CD. And I Thought A Maxi Single Has Like 6 OR 7 Songs Not 4, And It Should Have Had The Video To This Is Me REMIX Or At Least The Original Video.... But Nothing.... Here Are The Full Track List....This Is Me - REMIX (Feat. Kain & P.Diddy) (4:38)This Is Me - Mike Rizzo's Hyper Mix (3:32)This Is Me - Urban Remix (4:19)He Loves U Not - REMIX (Feat G. Dep & P.Diddy) (3:48)Well The First 2 Songs Are The Best The 3rd Track Is Kinda Slow Like A Slow Version.. He Loves U Not REMIX Is The Same REMIX From There Album...... All In All It's Alright But Not The Best...."
4,Great Season,I like how Booth & Brennan are starting a family and doing things that a normal couple do together and showing the problems this ensues.
2,The only sub-par season.,"I loveBones. However, perhaps because of Emily's pregnancy and delivery, the series seemed subdued and sub-par in all areas."
1,Undownloadable,I am very upset with amazon. I bought this and was unable to view it on my amazon fire. I tried contacting them 3 times nothing was resolved and I did not get my money back. Finally I tried my computer it worked but I did not buy it to watch on my computer. Now I hesitate to buy videos from axon knowing they may not be playable on my amazon fire
3,Losing its charm,"I was a huge fan of Bones when it originally aired. I've read the books this series is based upon, I work with ""squints"" and I thought the writing was spot on, especially the cultural conflict between the scientists and the ordinary joe, i.e., Booth. The original seasons creatively worked through those conflicts and demonstrated how a team can be formed from this kind of diversity. However, this season has become a characture of that original season. The characters who had grown are regressing. Bones is becoming every negative quality that can occur with an over inflated ego and it is not pleasant to watch. She's superior, hypercompetitive and she doesn't seem to realize that everyone has both strengths and weaknesses -- including her. If the writing doesn't somehow curb this trend I won't want to be around her and I sure won't tune in to watch."
1,Repeated pixelation,When you pay for HD you shouldn't get repeated pixelation. Poor quality.When you pay fot HD you shouldn't get repeated pixelation poor quality.
4,"Bones, The Gunk in the Garage","I loved the ""The Gunk in the Garage. You just can't go wrong with Bones. I love the show and hate it when it doesn't show on Mondays due to the baseball games.I can't wait for new shows and hope they get to the serial killer again. Love the cast and would recommend it to other fans, or people who haven't watched Bones. I have been a bones fan for over six years.Love the baby, and how the show ends with a segment of bones and booth in their home having great moments."
1,Awesome show - Lousy Amazon Delivery,Love the show but hate having to wait until 3:30 am EST Wednesday morning to get a download of a show that airs on Monday night. Apple always has it the next morning. Get with the program Amazon.
5,BONES/SEASON 8,BONES IS ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVORITE TELEVISION SERIES RUNNING AT THIS TIME. I OWN THE PREVIOUS SEVEN SEASONS ON DVD AND LIKE TO REWATCH THEM. I LOVE ALL THE CHARACTERS AND THEIR RELATIONSHIPS.
5,love Bones,I cannot believe how much i've come to love this show but i am so glad i've discovered it - caught up to 8th season in 2 weeks!
2,It used to be a good show,"In the past seasons, the crime investigations were generally entertaining and the personal side stories were interesting. This year the crime investigations for the most part are still fairly good but the personal side stories have become a much larger part of the show and the only word that I can think of the describe their actions is silly."
4,Season 8 of Bones delivers!,I thoroughly enjoy Bones and Season 8 did not let me down.I'm not yet through all the extra features on the DVDs but they are always fun.
4,very enjoyable,We really enjoy watching these. Bones is one of our favorite tv shows so it is a joy to be able to catch up on missed episodes on our own time.
1,Bad video Quality .....,Many blurry images and it wasnt worth renting it - Need some best quality video that we can enjoy .
1,Commercials?!,WHY am I paying to watch commercials both before & after the show?! Iam NOT going to continue paying for these shows with commercials! I have a very limited amount of internet and these stupid commercials take up a valued portion! STOP MAKING US PAY FOR COMMERICIALS!!!!
3,Adds Bite,I pay for the episodes so I don't have to watch adds why does fox think they can advertise and that we have to take it I won't be buying any more episodes until they remove the adds.
5,Still the BEST :),"They are still going strong! This is a series that will go down in TV history! What a team, what exciting and enthralling episodes and story lines!"
5,Great Show,My teenage granddaughters love this show. My wife and I enjoy sitting and watching it with them. Great show for all.
3,lost its sexual tension,I can't explain it. As soon as they finally end up living in the same house with a baby... it's too much like real life and not as great as the other seasons. And somehow Bones seems kind of dumber. I dunno. But I don't think I wanted to see the petty arguments of a mama and baby daddy as much as I liked the philosophical and semantic debates of a scientist and a fbi agent. Being shacked up and acting like an old married couple is not nearly as interesting. I canceled my subscription after 3 shows.
1,jumped the shark.,that's all i can say. didn't they already play out this evil genius has it in for bones plot? ugh.
5,The Future in the Past,Good ending that leaves the story arc in play with both Palaunt and Agent Flin. We can see both of them in future cybernatic battles.
1,Psychics? Ghosts? This is supposed to be about science. And PAYING FOR ADS!?,"I'm done with Bones.Season 7 and 8 have consistently been deteriorating.Bones (the character) became a caricature of herself.Keeping only the stereotypical portions of herself and losing all actual scientific objectivity.Ghost in the Machine was the last straw.The entire episode is 'from the perspective of a camera in a skull'.That's not ""maybe it's a ghost"", that's ""it's a ghost"".The science has been deteriorating.Their treatment of hackers is even worse than in movies.The characters act as is necessary for the plot instead of growing or being consistent.Also.. starting in Season 8 I believe.What the hell is going on with us PAYING FOR ADS?"
3,Slowing down,"Seasons 1-6, I'd give this series 5 stars easy.Granted you had to turn your brain off on certain aspects of it, but the shows in general were crafted quite well, if unbelievable. The characters were likeable and the series took chance; many of those chances I didn't really agree on, but still it moved the plot forward.I mean seriously malware delivered as a fractal pattern etched on the end of a bone that is scanned in and causes a whole data centers fans to shut down?I'm lucky to get a 2D object scanned in at 300 dpi, let alone have the scanning software trigger some sort of data center cascade.This last series, isn't bad per se, but seems like they are coasting quite a bit. Humor isn't quite there, plot lines are of the single episode variety (no season wide big bad).I still watch it, hopefully, but to date, mildly entertaining at best."
3,Not up to par,"I am a fervent fan of Bones. This season has been shallow compared with previous ones. I always watch seasons multiple times, so maybe this one gets better after the disappointment wears off. I suspect the problem is poor writing because the acting is top quality. The most recent episode as of this writing, ""The Ghost in the Machine"" is wretched. I felt sorry for the cast."
5,'Bones' back to good storytelling,"I have been a ""Bones"" fan from the get-go, but thought last year was less than par. This year the writing has improved and the writers are successfully navigating the Bones-Booth relationship. No mean feat. Often when the lead characters finally get together, a TV show seems to lose it's zeal, but this season is refreshingly lively. I've come to accept the increased grossness that marred last season -- not sure if I'm getting used to it, or it's been toned downed a tad.Just happy to report the writing has improved, as it has this season on another show I watch, ""Castle."" I'm a fan of several BBC shows and was despairing that the American writers weren't producing quality, but I'm feeling better now."
5,BONES IS AWESOME,This episode had a quick download and great picture quality. Bones is an absolutely incredible show that I am entirely hooked on. The characters and premise of the show are addicting--Emily Deschanel and David Boreanaz are an amazing pair. BONES IS THE BEST SHOW ON TELEVISION
5,"This is the ""perfect campfire grill!""","I also have their 18"" round version for family camping. This size is perfect for the two of us and works great."
3,Big House; Not a big deal.,"This is a very compelling story of the career path of someone in the penal system. It has several good accounts and some characters are pretty well defined, however, it reads like a childrens' book."
1,One man's skewed opinion,"As someone who has conducted psychiatric assessments in California's supermax, Level IV (of IV) prisons, of inmates with mental health disorders preparing to parole, I was seriously underwhelmed by this minimilistic, even meager portrayal of ""life"" on the inside. If you want ""real life,"" go to http://oig.ca.gov/ and download the report of the murder of Corrections Officer Manuel Gonzalez (right-hand column). Now that is ""life"" in the big house. Games, maipulations, yeah, yeah. Bruton is wise enough not to disclose the reality. For that, read R.D. Hare's ""Without Conscience,"" and you'll wished you had skipped Bruton."
3,"Just an ""OK"" read.","If you've watched any of the prison documentaries on TV, then you can save yourself a lot of time by not reading this book. If you're just curious about prison life and are looking for an inside look at what goes on, then this book will educate and enlighten you.The most troubling part of the book to me is the high regard that the author has for himself. I've lost track of how many times he pats himself on the back for the running the cleanest, safest, best organized, and best run prisons in the country. He takes shots at other states and other prisons and then holds himself up as the model warden who blends the right amount of supermax discipline with the knowledge of knowing when the convicts need a break.It was interesting but at the same time I quickly tired of hearing just how terrific a warden the author was back in the day. He reminds of something I heard an old NBA basketball player say. ""The older I get the better I was."""
5,Finding manifestations of holiness in earthly things,"Written by Timothy Liu, editor of ""Word of Mouth: An Anthology of Gay American Poetry"", Hard Evidence is a unique and original collection of free-form verse concerning such matters as finding manifestations of holiness in earthly things, gay sexuality, and the cruel legacy of the virus that causes AIDS. Hard evidence is eye-opening, thought-provoking poetry that flows from page to page, almost as if all part of one grand poem. Binoculars left in the backseat/of your car. Tread marks leading/to a flattened toad with flies/crawling over it. Those pagodas/in the distance somehow made/a difference - joss sticks stuck/in giant urns burnishing in the air."
4,Lovely addition to traditional tableware,This makes a wonderful addition to my other Spode Judaica pieces. Can be used for bread as well as other items with trivet removed.Shipping left a lot to be desired. First piece came totally smashed!
4,Tonga & Samoa in one book,I used the Moon guidebook to Tonga and Samoa during a 3 1/2 week trip to the South Pacific in early 2001. I found the book very useful because it covers Tonga and Samoa in one condensed book. There are enough details to travel on both island groups for a couple of weeks and not missing information in this great guidebook. The book is still quite accurate there is enough details for each spot you will visit on your trip. In general this book has helped me a lot to find my way around the islands with detailed maps and a wide range of unbiased information.
1,Not as good as Lonely Planet...,"I bought this and the Lonely Planet Samoa book just before visiting the South Pacific and I have to say that this book gives a completly misleading picture of Samoa and it's people.With stories of how you'll be stoned by children while walking though a village, having your rental car vandalised and being ripped off by local taxi drivers (to quote just 3 examples), it is quite obivously written with the paranoid American tourist in mind.Buy the Lonely Planet guide instead."
5,A True Classic,"I bought this book over 25 years ago and consider it a true classic. Trends may come and go, but the sophisticated and timeless style featured in the traditional section has inspired me again and again. Particularly helpful are the sections on historical furniture styles and space planning. Just what you would expect from the New York Times."
2,extremely dry,"The book moves through so many people so quickly that it is difficult to follow what is being talked about. The names are unfamiliar, the places are unfamiliar; and the maps often don't name the areas being mentioned. The font is extremely small and eye strain is also a problem. This type of material is what makes history unpalatable. I have discovered since leaving school that history is fascinating, but one needs to be able to learn about the times, the people and the places. Just dates and events, with people never being fleshed out is extremely boring. I was very disappointed in these books."
2,To be used with great caution,"This, the second of a two-volume work, ought to have been a standard history of the Ottoman Empire; it falls far short of expectations, however, due to the very large number of simple factual errors it contains, as well as the authors' bias toward nationalist Turkish interpreations of the recent past. This imbalance consistently permeates the book, wherein the authors seem to see themselves as having to ""defend"" the Ottomans against their critics, and is most extreme in the treatment of the Armenian Genocide. (The vehemence seen in some of the reviews below evidences the strong and partisan passions that beset this issue; while the authors' language is more temperate than that of some of the reviewers, they are not much more objective.)This book, long awaited by Ottomanists, proved to be rather an embarrassment to the field when it appeared. Readers should be aware that it is both unreliable and very partisan."
2,It's Not Worth $99,"It consists of a series of wooden tableaus, mostly filmed inside a huge warehouse. It was all Gance could afford.The actor playing Napoleon lacks the passion of the man.The best role and scene is Orson Wells as Robert Fulton pushing a steam-powered troop carrier but Napoleon is thinking of hot air balloons instead.The ""battle"" is fought mostly in the fog.Which about says it for the film.A shame, as Gance's 1926 ""Napoleon"" is a gem."
3,smaller than standard,"These are nice mugs, well made and I like the color and pattern a lot. However, I was surprised how SMALL they are, only about 9 oz. Don't be fooled by the shape. They hold more than a tea cup but less than a generic coffee mug."
4,One of two workbooks by Elizabeth Power that are easy to use,"This is one of the best books for people who have DID. Reasons being that the paragraphs are short, have lots of space for notes between them, was written in very short sections at a time so if you are switching a lot, it's easy to pick up where you left off when your alters are reading with you. Elizabeth Power really put a lot of thought into the making of this book and making it easy for those of us with DID to read and understand everything in it as well as being very easy to use as a workbook."
5,P-Town Series,"I read these out of order because I didn't know they were a series. I loved re-reading them in order, just to see how the main characters found each other in the beginning. Now their story means even more."
5,Radclyffe Hasn't Written a Bad Book,"I read this book for the first time in late 2003 and finished the paperback version last week to prepare for the next in the series to be released in 2005. I thoroughly enjoyed this sequel to Safe Harbor. Radclyffe takes the inexperienced, but faithful, Reese and the jilted Tory down the road of starting their own family. She also explores the relationship of the young lovers Brianna and Carre as they begin to cross over into adulthood. Radclyffe delivers turmoil, mystery, problems with pregnancy, relationship fears, and so much more. This book takes the reader on many emotional highs and lows, and is highly recommended by this reviewer."
3,dense and unfinished,"I had a lot of trouble understanding what was going on in this book. and when I got to the end, it didn't feel like the end. Tourmalyne's new trip to the Hinterlands awaits, as well as the strange developing relationship with Luna and whatever it was she actually wanted, which we never really find out.I do love her books, but I kept looking for a second book to go with this one because it just doesn't feel finished. It also never answers why the Basilisk attacked house Tormalyne in the first place. Like he just out of the blue without provocation did that? Yet he didn't seem to be that big a pscyho in the rest of the book?I'm going to give this three stars as just OK because it is an enjoyable read, but the Riddle Master of Hed was much better. Just my opinion of course."
5,Top of the line,"Having read the Riddlemaster trilogy through about 8 or 9 times, I was pleased to see that McKillip had written other books. This one is excellently written, and has a more cohesive plot than some of her works (e.g., Winter Rose and the Sorceress and the Cygnet). Although I don't think any of her books since the trilogy have approached the level of sheer delightfulness that the trilogy did, this one is worth reading, if for nothing else than the evocation of setting by pure wordskill."
3,"Interesting, but vague","When McKillip's at her best, she's pure magic. This book is not one of her best, but still holds enough of her quirky mysticism to capture a fan's attention. The basic plot will be familiar to McKillip fans: Rook Caladrius puzzles over the secret of his true identity while making astonishing music-- much like Morgon in her masterpiece ""The Riddlemaster of Hed,"" with some echoes from her one space opera, ""Fool's Run."" Unfortunately, the reader knows the solution to Rook's identity crisis before he even starts looking, so the quest lacks suspense. However, when a troop of musicians must write and perform an opera for a king they hate, McKillip gets a lot of fun out of playing with the twisted relationships between art and life, truth and fiction. For that alone, the book was worth reading."
4,Started and finished reading on the day I got it,"Song for the Basilisk may not be Patricia McKillip's best work, but nothing in this story let me down. I was drawn into the world she created from the first word. Her thrifty use of imagery always takes me by surprise, and this world was full of music all its own. I admit that I was surprised by the ending. While I was pleased to be surprised, some of the characters lacked depth, as if McKillip did not really know what to expect from the characters or she wasn't sure who the hero should be. Of course, I will be waiting for the next McKillip book! I liked this one but not as much as The Sorceress and the Cygnet or The Cygnet and the Firebird, which remain my favorites."
3,"Fine, not Great","The cover was gorgeous, such lovely eye candy from all 360 degrees. I really wanted to like the book, but I just couldn't swallow all the richly detailed texts and situations. Just like the cover, this book is way too detailed and tedious. Maybe next time."
1,What was she thinking?,"I have been reading fantasy for 50 years, and this was one of the worst. Flowery literary style simply doesn't compensate for a plodding plot. Using a basic change of character to resolve the plot conflict is so amateurish, I can't believe it got published. A very definite ""Save your money"""
5,A Joy To Listen To...,"With the combination of Skitch Henderson's musical adaptation's and Michael Maguire's voice, this is a CD worthy to be in your collection. Michael was in San Antonio last year with the San Antonio Symphony and proved his voice is right up there with therest of the great tenor's of today."
4,Magical Moments form Great Musicals,"Like Andrew Lloyd Webbers music very much, looking for the song from his birthday show that has the line ""I wish I knew"""
5,Awesome product,Bought this and give to my 90 lb lab mix who has a very course coat and sheds a lot. Began giving this product 2 weeks ago and have seen a HUGE difference! Shedding is cut by at least 50% and his coat is amazingly shiny and soft. Would highly recommend and will continue to use despite the product being a little pricey.
5,A good book,"I tried three different books for the TI-83/84 series, and this was the best. It features easy-to-follow, step-by-step instructions for much of what I needed to do for the pre-calculus class that I teach. I recommend this book."
3,Informative But Over-Priced,This is a well-written book if your interest is in calculus. It is over-priced for what it offers.
1,I disappointed by you taking away of my money with outt any reason,"regarding the above product I ordered it by mistake and requested to replace it by calculator and returned to your company right away and while I was waiting for the calculator you guys sent me back again the same book which I do not need it. According to this I called customer service and they told me to return it back again in order to refund my money.The result was taking the product and refuse to return my money (34.99) with out any reason .If you need to be loyal to your customer please do not cheat poor students' money. $34 is nothing for me, but very bad for you customer relation.According to what you did to me you will loose your customer in the long run. if you are genuin business men please refund my money"
4,Solid and readable,"Enjoyable collection of 10 books of letters written by Gaius Plinius Luci. The first nine are collections of personal letters, the last being a posthumous collection of letters written between Pliny and Emperor Trajan.Although I found little insight into the broader social strata of the Roman upper class of Pliny's time from these letters, they are for the most part an enjoyable look inside the mind and character of one of its more respectable members.The collections of personal letters can get a tad tedious at times, but the last book, containing the correspondence with Trajan, is consistently fascinating as we get a brief peek into the administrative machiniations between one of Rome's finest monarchs and a loyal agent."
4,Wonderful,"Having read the letters of Pliny in the original Latin, I picked up a copy of this book to enjoy at a lesiurely pace (and without the hassel of looking up every 15th word!). I could not have been more pleased with Radice's translation of the work. She brings his stories to life, while maintaining the nuances found in the Latin. Wonderful!!"
5,The Letters of Plinius Secundus,"A readable translation of the many letters of one of history's most famous letter writers, and also a good source on his eventful life. Caius Plinius Secundus had correspondence with many of the great men of his time, including Emperor Trajan and the historians Tacitus and Suetonius, and wrote of such fascinating topics as the Dacian Wars, Christians in his province of Bithynia, the excesses of the recently murdered Emperor Domitianus, and various obscure topics from hunting to an alleged haunted house in Greece. A great book for someone, who, like me, likes to read about the Romans from their own pens."
1,HIX,"There really isn't much to this film. Kurt plays an atheist sheriff (not that it played into the film) who is attempting to solve murders in a small river town. There really wasn't much acting, not much of a soundtrack and not much of a plot. At first I thought this was an attempt at a Christian slasher movie, but it really failed there too as the heavy religion aspect didn't play any kind of role.As a bad or campy film, it lacks there too. The dialouge was dry. I would say avoid at all costs.Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. $3.99 for a rental? They need to pay you to watch it. This should be out on some cheap sci-fi 12 pack."
4,Genres jump too drastically...,"This is made up of 19 tracks of outtakes, rarities & live stuff. Jason Ringenberg gives a couple of sentences of background info on each song. Some of the highlights are a live guitar duel in the true sense of the word between Warren Hodges & Link Wray...covers of Polk Salad Annie and Ruby, Don't Take Your Love To Town with the guitarist from The Georgia Satellites and there is a real tearjerker that's sung by Hodges' mom. As individual songs go, this disk is a great collection...but as an entire album it fails because the songs genres jump too drastically between mellow C&W weepers into live raunchy ""guitars on 11"" rockers. It was laid out chronologically but in this case it's too jarring. But it should sound great in my CD shuffler."
3,"Really three-and-a-half, but Amazon.com don't like half-stars, durn, 'Em!","Another very fine compilation ofB songs, sides, 'in-the-can' stuffand goofs as only this band can makethem sound good. Fine collectable,but look especially for EssentialJ& S! Pick Up on It!"
3,Basic Ambient,"I'm not going to waste your time here.This album has no 'boops' or 'beeps', no 808 snare hits.Do you like Brian Eno's 'Another Green World'? Tangerine Dream 'Phaedra'? Harold Budd? Woob?....this album is nowhere near as good as any of those artists or releases.Maybe A little too dependant on some of the 'New-Age' trappings (birds, crickets and waves ---yawn) a little heavy handed in it's instrumentation (could use at least some 'break-downs' and 'builds' to create at least a little tension) and frankly a little derivative (more similar to mid 80's subliminal 'self-help' cassettes than any mid 70's Eno.)BUT, it's a nice little slice of ambient, and not enough stuff like this is being produced by 'New Wave' artists....I still miss Vinces original Beeps and Boops with Depeche Mode, though."
4,Geat!,It is really great that this book is available online because it saved me a lot of time and money. It was either to buy this book online and read it off my phone or to go to the bookstore at my community college which is very far from my house. I'm glad that I chose this method of buying this book and I hope that other peers will look into doing this also to save them time and money as well.
3,Great Price,"Great movies, especially Shrek and Shrek 2. My 3 year-old son didn't care too much for Shrek The Third. Good price for all three movies."
5,great movies,"these movies are great, my son just loves them.They come in a nice box so they all stay together nicely."
1,Where's the Widescreen???,"Why on earth are they only offering these movies in full screen? Even if you don't have an HDTV you still want these in widescreen. I won't be buying any of the Shrek movies until a widescreen box set is available. Come on Dreamworks, get on it!!"
1,DO NOT BUY FROM THIS VENDOR,"I ordered this product for my son's birthday and it NEVER arrived! They willfully refunded me, however when I e-mailed them back asking them to overnight this product...no response. I reported to Amazon and hopefully noone elses child will be disapointed on their birthday."
4,Shrek Collection,Very good entertainment. Lots of fun for the cost of this set. I would rcommend this to all Shrek fans.
4,One and Only Love Album,"These are a couple of good cds. In fact one of the songs is stuck in my head right now. It wasn't exactly what I was looking for I wanted songs from the 70's, not necessarily love songs. But it appears Time Life has that market cornered because I couldn't find anything that really came close. But for love songs from then, this is great."
2,"Not history, but important","Historically speaking, this book deserves a rating of 1. ""The God of the Witches"" basically re-states the theories of ""Witch Cult in Modern Europe"" -- in a more extreme and dogmatic form. Murray's theories were conclusively debunked in the 1970's. Scholars demonstrated that she twisted and falsified evidence, that she ignored the vast majority of our data on historical Witchcraft. On the other hand, this book had a profound impact on modern Witchcraft (one might say a profoundly BAD impact, but that's another issue). So this is an important book to read if you want to understand the development of Wicca and modern Paganism. Just don't mistake it for history"
2,wishful thinking and misinformed,"Murray, like Gardner and Crowley, was one of those early eclectics about her study of the Old Religion. There is too much supposition and not enough factual basis for her conclusions on the development of the ""Witch God."" The first chapter, however, is a great read following the earliset depictions of the horned god. But the jump to stating that these depictions from all over Europe at varying times are linked to a single cohesive religion is tenuous. This is yet another case in which the author has made the facts fit her conception rather than objectively trying to make connections between the facts. This is the case, unfortunately, for almost all early expositors of witchcraft and the Old Religion. Read the more scholarly ""Triumph of the Moon"" by Ronald Hutton if you're looking for objectivity rather than charlatanism."
1,"Sorry, Miss Murray........","Unlike most of the reviewers here, I come from a different starting place. I knew Margaret Murray. She lived to be a hundred years old and died in 1963.It's a shame that she's known mostly now for her books on witches. She was an Egyptologist and did valuable work back in the late 1890's with Sir Matthew Finders Petrie.This book is not one of her best. She was cantankerous to say the least. She would agree with me, if she were able. Sorry, Margaret....."
2,Pass this one up completely!,Most of the sources are taken directly from the inquisitors. What other information contained is based more on conjecture than science as we know it. The book is a piece trapped by the historical conditions from which it emerged. While it may be on the reading list of many Wiccan teachers it should be known that this book serves more as a contrast of the ignorance and lack of accurate information available.
1,Hard to believe we're still discussing this,"Murray's book actually contains a statement to the effect of ""What reason would there have been for anyone to be accused of witchcraft other than that they were a witch?"" and its entire argument is based on testimonies extracted under torture by people who were using the _Malleus Maleficarum_ as a guide, and would not accept any answers except what the book told them to expect.The main reason to own this book today is for its place in the history of ideas about European Paganism."
1,What you'd expect,"I held out a slim hope that it might work because I wanted it to. It doesn't and I ended up doing it by eye just fine.If you need to make a large quanity of lumber and can't afford the 7K for a real set-up, don't think this is a good alternative."
2,Mine turned into a shrapnel bomb.,"My lid arrived with the knob as separate parts. It wouldn't stay tight in use. On my last try tightening it, the glass exploded into safety glass bits, leaving shrapnel wounds on my hand. I called the ""secret"" Amazon customer service number, and was given a refund without having to return the lid (I offered pictures of my sink and my hand). All in the first half hour since the box arrived. I'm still bleeding, but I have no desire to spend the evening at an emergency room.The pan looks great (I have to clean glass from my kitchen before I can try it), but I don't want a replacement lid; I could have been blinded.(Doesn't the two stars make you wonder what it would take to get a one star rating from me?)"
1,Total Concepts; Swiss Diamond Products,"Total Concepts is not an authorized retailer for Swiss Diamond products.The lid came without a knob ~ so what good is that?The lid itself is great ~ we had to go to the dealer in order to get a knob for it though.We would never order a product from Total Concepts again. Upon speaking to Total Concepts, they were utterly of NO HELP in helping us get the knob ..... which should have come with the original purchase."
5,Perfect fit,"I spent 2 hours looking all over town for a lid for my 12.5"" sautee pan with no luck. 5 minutes on the internet and it was on its way."
3,"Cute intro into the ""Simply"" series","Kane McDermott is an undercover detective who finds himself with the petty task of investigating Kayla's etiquette school for businessmen. It appears that it may actually be a house of ill repute. The attraction between the two is sizzling. Just when he determines that she may be innocent, evidence stacks against her and danger lurks around the corner. In order to protect her, he will have to come clean, which could destroy the fragile relationship.Phillips breezy story has great tension and her usual heated sensuality featuring incredible chemistry between the protagonists that'll keep the reader glued to the pages of this romance with light suspense. It is the best of the trilogy which also includes ""Simply Scandalous"" featuring her sister Cat and ""Simply Sensuous."""
2,Simply Crappy. A very poorly written book.,"I am an avid reader of all genre's including romance. This is by far the worst book I've read in a long time. The author tells, not shows, what is going on and has long bouts of meaningless and endlessly repeating thoughts between the dialog. A few times I had to go back a couple pages to remember what the previous character had said.The plot might be okay if it were executed well. It wasn't. There are a lot of fun easy reads out there. Books like this is what gets the Romance genre laughed at."
4,"""Are you going to Lucky Detective?""",Simply Sinful by Carly Phillips is clever quick read. Detective Kane McDermott is assigned to find out if Kayla Luck is running an escort service. Kayla Luck is a sweet trusting woman who decides to make Kane her first one nightstand. Everything goes wrong and Kane ends up moving in with Kayla to `protect her' from the bad guys. The next story of the series is 'Simply Scandalous' tells the story of Kayla's little sister Catherine.
5,Healing Book,"This book is a must for anyone wanting to live a good healthy lifestyle, with detailed questions to find out what foods are best for you. well wrapped and arrived very quickly. Thank you"
1,Never got it!,I never got this item! It keeps saying in transit!I want my money back or a replacement. Its been way over a month.Unreliable shipper.
3,Don't be fooled this is not the original artists,It is actually Easy Listening (Elevator Music) versions done by The Moonlight Moods Orchestra although they are good versions but for those that think you'll get the real songs you won't.I wonder why these sellers here are not noting that fact
3,Track Listing,"I'm not much in the way of the written word, but the track listing would probably be helpful in the consideration of this product.Disc 11. Return To Innocence - Enigma2. Only You - Praise3. Mike Oldfield - Sentinel4. Harry's Game - Clannad5. Brideshead Theme - Geoffrey Burgon6. Crocket's Theme - Jan Hammer7. Angelo Badalamenti - Twin Peaks8.

1,What a shame! What happened to Phil...,"Well.. let me say I am a huge fan of LA Guns. And I especially love Cocked & Loaded, one of the best records ever. The production is awesome, as well as the music and each note. Not even mentioning Phil Lewis voice, magic. Now, I understand they're no more main stream, so the production is tight. And I know that voice is a delicate instrument that loses so much over the years. But here you can really tell that he's not even trying.. many vocal parts are missing, and Ballad of Jane one octave below the original tone.. that's unacceptable to me. Too bad. I used to love them. Not worth the money, not even for a huge fan."
3,Cocked & ReLoaded,"Slap in the Face, Malaria, 17 Crash, and I'm Addicted are as good if not better then the orig, but the remander of this recording is not as good as Cocked & Loaded. Track down Cocked & Loaded and the Liberators CD instead if you can, Phils voice is much better on those recordings.This one and Black Beauties are not the best of the 3 Cleopatra releases. Given the choice go for Live! A Night On The Strip. Phils voice recovered on that CD and proves that he can take the test of time."
1,Shouldn't have been made,"There are a lot of songs out there that, when they are re-made, sound even better than the originals. Most groups that re-make their own songs should have stuck with the originals. Add this to that list. All of the songs from the original album are re-made. If you loved the original album, Cocked and Loaded, as I did, you will not like this album. The music itself is ok, although the tempo of the songs is slower, as if the entire band's age has caught up with them and they can't play as fast as they used to. The real problem is with Phil Lewis' voice. He simply can't hit the notes anymore, which is most evident in old favorite ""The Ballad Of Jayne"". It sounds like a bad country song. Buy this one at your own risk."
4,Seems like a great idea,I loved the orthaheel sandles that I got earlier and was looking forward to my new insoles so I could wear my dress shoes with the same comfort. I am not sure if it was my mistake or the listing didn't offer a size option but the insoles were too small. I have returned them to dealer and am waiting for an exchange. Even though they were too small for my shoes they seemed like they will be great in the right size.
2,Not what I expected,I have several orthaheel shoes and they give good relief to my arch and heel pain. I thought if I got the inserts I could use my other shoes. Not the case. This insole was soft and bendy it did not have the arch support that I need to be able to use my other shoes
5,Amazing,This was exactly what I wanted. My baby sister had one of these ever since she was born. But her current one was wearing out so I wanted to keep it in a glass case for memories. So I spent hours looking for an exact replica. Until I finally stumbled with you guys. Thank you guys so much!!! You made our Christmas even happier.
1,Misrepresented as a cover.,"It is not a cover, but more like a cutting board that sits on top the stove grate and is much higher than the surrounding area.must be stored when moving as it will fall off."
3,Ear force HPa .1 Surround Headphones 5 W Amp & Mic,-Bass response not very good-Rear surround sound not very good-Ear cup material will stick to your head and sometimes come off if you've been wearing the headphones a long time (very difficult to reattach)-Power knob is very phlimsy and sometimes comes off-Cord securing clamp broke during first use-Cord not very long
1,The worst product for 3D sound,"Luckily I learned about Sound Blaster's X-FI CSMSS 3D Headphone sound in time and cancelled my order before the headphones arrived. For about the same price you can get one of the industry's best sound cards (xtrememusic) and have real 3D sound including vertical sound in some of the newest games. It is amazing, don't buy 3D headphones, get a new sound card, update the drivers and you won't be disappointed. I am amazed at the realism everytime I play BF2."
2,Good for gaming,"I use these to play Battlefield 2 - I dont expect high quality sound from gaming headsets, the 5.1 channels let me hear directional sound which is very important in the fps world.The microphone is excellent - very good voice pickup without a lot of background noise pickup. People actually commented on the clarity of my voice over ts and in game voip.I gave them a two because they are damn uncomfortable for any kind of duration. I have to remove my glasses and I have to take off the headphones between games to get blood back in my ears. They must have designed them for the typical 12 year gaming boy. Dont they know geeks have big heads?? and we play games well into our middle age years??If you want good directional sound and you have a small head, these headphones will work for you. Right now I am searching for a comfortable replacement."
4,"Very good, after a slight adjustment","Paired with an X-Fi, these are fantastic. People who are complaining about these hurting...get 2 tissues, roll them up the long way, flatten them down just a bit, and you can slide them underneath the inside of the ear pads...problem solved. This adds a little extra cushion and saves you some headaches and takes about 30 seconds. I would buy these 10 times over once I did that. Great for gaming."
5,Good for the price,"These headphones sound goood. There was a bit of bass buzzing and distortion at higher volumes, but all that was solved with the purchase of a sound card. ON BOARD AUDIO BLOWS. If you really want these headphones to sound good you NEED to buy a sound card.As to the people who say they are painful to wear:I let these cling onto a tissue box when i wasn't using them (and overnight) for the first 5 days, and they do not hurt no longer! I can go for 5hrs and forget that I'm wearing them. They are a bit heavy at first, but you get used to it."
3,Five Star Sound In A 1 star Ear Pad,The Sound from the Turtle Beach Headseat is great and the mic is nice too. But I found the Lack of a Mute for the Mic a big over site. Also who ever picked the Cheep and Lacking of Earpad should be shot. After wearing the head set for 1 hour you start to get a sore ear from the speaker surface next to your ear. I have had $30.00 Head sets use better padding. For a company that makes sound cards and Head phones for Music they realy droped the Ball. I would have to say unless your going to buy a ear pad and Mod the headset your self Spend the extra money and get a better made set. You can look for mine on ebay.
4,"Good sound quality, poor design","My headset arrived with one of the ear cups off. It was extremely difficult to put on. This happened again a few days later. I really like the volume control, and the sound is good, but I can't really discern sound quality very well. For people with physically large heads, the earpieces don't swivel all the way, so the earpieces angle away from the ears, and don't create a seal around the ears. The mic windscreen does tend to fall off easily, and I have been putting the headphones on a tissue box all the time as another user suggested, but they still are uncomfortable after several hours of use. I have not tried the tissue in the earcups method. If you have a small head, it seems that these would be a great fit, provided the earcups stay on. It would be nice to be able to use them with out the online power. They are NOT MOBILE HEADPHONES!I am glad I bought them, however."
5,Seth Readers,"For Seth readers, this book, is most interesting, giveing more insite into Jane and Seth."
2,CAUTION !,"A previous review indicated these batteries were Rhino (a known and respected name) so I order them. Imagine my surprise when I open box to find ""Golden Dragon"" labeled chinese batteries, with a nice chinese / english warning label. My original battery (APC) weights in a 26.5 lbs, these weigh in at 20.8 lbs. Have to tell you something about the plates inside.It did install ok, and after charged, it shows correct voltage. I guess you get what you pay for. I am not hopeful of it making a year worth of service. YMMVPS. besides reuse of connectors, you will also need some double back tape to put cells together.. otherwise the fuse link can get stressed."
4,Quick Purchase,"Just bought this product and it arrived very fast. Haven't played with it just yet, but put it in my APC unit in hopes to get it up and running soon. Will update if I find troubles with the batteries. Note: Comes without the connectors, but well stated in the subject line - not big surprise there but very easy to reassemble using existing connectors."
1,not what I expected-- probably my fault,The tiles are difficult for smaller children to manipulate. It wasn't what I expected but would be good for older children. Probably my fault for not reading the suggested age.
1,[...] for refrigerator magnets?,"[...] for refrigerator magnets? That is what you get with this set, a thin piece of metal and thin-cheap refrigerator magnets. I really thought that the magnets would be more substantial. This is way overpriced at [...] and should be closer to $10."
1,sucks,this gun sucks i got it to day and i saw it shoot it go's about 10 feet this gun is the wors crapiest i have got so far don't get it.
5,great great great,"i got my set today. great shipping only 3 days, great price, great gun. it shoots hard(for a pistol). shoots pretty accurate within 50 feet. looks very cool, easy operate. great buy and I would recommend to anyone."
3,you get what you pay for,"the guns are of low grde plastic construction besides the fact that the gun must be cocked before every fire there is no safety in response to the question about the orange tip, the last 2 inches of the barrel is made of orange plastic,the clip's not bad it will hold about 15 rounds and accuracy is not bad for the price in short the gun looks and feels cheap the only real redeming factor to this is the price."
2,Decent Buy,"Initially a very good buy, however after only 3 days of very light use I had an internal piston head on one of the guns break while the gun was resting on a desk.... and I was in another room. For the look and price its a good buy but you get what you pay for in this case."
2,Bad guns- read story,"Im new to airsoft and wanted a couple pistols to screw around with friends with, and found these. i probably just expected too much out of them, being about $8 a gun you shouldnt expect too much. Well, me and a friend began shooting at each other, and the BBs curved largely to the left. Not just a little, but one of them made a near diagonal line to the left. They're really light (although expected with cheap guns) and have a really clumsy feel. They at least look kind of neat, and the plastic orange tip is mainly hidden by that attached compensator (looks only). I later bought a $30 gun at meijer and it shoots nearly twice as far, and shoots straight. These are just useful if you have too many people and not enough guns. Dont expect to win with these, unless you're fighting other people with the same thing. And on another note, my friend pushed down the magazine release and it snapped off. He wasnt pressing hard, it was just weak defective plastic."
3,Avoid Burger's book,"Burger's book is a poor buy, as Burger's analysis is weak. It is a book of polemic rather than philosophical depth and his writing is much poorer than either Clifford's or James's.Clifford's fundamental assumptions are circular - he states that ""it is wrong always, everywhere, and for anyone, to believe anything upon insufficient evidence"". However, he offers no evidence in support of this assertion, thus failing his own test.The thesis of foundationalism has been successfully refuted by Alvin Plantinga and others (see his ""Warranted Christian Belief""), but this essay still remains the archetype of the classical foundationalist approach."
5,Early Bergman is worthy of classic Bergman,These films though early works are worthy of the genius of Bergman and in many cases more accessible for the understanding of the classic Bergman themes: man's struggle with the anguishes of life.Recommended for the Bergman lover and those unacquainted with the poet of misery.
5,Eclipse Series One,"One of the more important figures of modern film, a gifted cinematic artist, Ingmar Bergman continued to venture into exciting narrative and thematic areas in his directorial career. Almost defining his own genre Bergman probed the heights and depth of human emotion. His work was influential on entire generations of filmmakers around the globe. His primary concerns crossed over from spiritual conflict while probing the fragility of the human psyche. Within this framework, he has crafted a body of work universally celebrated for its technical innovations while exploring the human condition. Bergman is quoted as saying ""No form of art goes (as far) beyond ordinary consciousness as film does, straight to our emotions, deep into the twilight room of the soul.""The previous reviewer is incorrect in that there will be no extras on Eclipse Series releases, but this is still an incredible deal. It is fully reviewed at DVDBeaver.RECOMMENDED!"
5,Just what I wanted.,"This bag is exactly as described, and exactly what I wanted: zippered and padded, with several carrying options. (There are handles and an adjustable shoulder strap like in the picture, plus backpack-style straps that can be tucked into a pocket when they aren't needed.) My 15-chord ChromaHarp fits into this bag perfectly."
5,Probably One of the 50 Greatest Recordings,"In case you know little about Katz: he is a pianist who ""compels attention"", who is ""technically brilliant and full of poetry"". A child prodigy admired even by Enescu and his piano teacher also taught Lipatti.Katz and Szeryng are "" ultimate Appolonian musicians; beauty of tone, immaculate phrasing, and careful obedience to the composer's indications took precedence over...flamboyant... and inflated egos.""I recommend this record for it's unsurpassed music plus poetry, from either or both instruments. Moreover, the record itself, in the conveyance of poetry and music of the highest order is as good as any modern recording. Not only is the recorded sound much much better than Thibaud/Cortot, in many a way, their playing is more overwhelming and certainly commands more attention! This definitely deserves 2 stars more than any collaboration between Szeryng/Rubinstein.Definitely one of the greatest and rarest heritage of human culture."
5,"Fantastic balance and Superb sound of both, piano & violin",It is a powerful and wonderful performance.
3,Just okay,"These are EE rated pads, so if you want immediate stops, look elsewhere. They do work for a daily driver, they are quiet and they bed in faster than other cheap semi-metallics I've used in the past. They feel great until the blue coating wears off (50-100 stops) and then they are just another cheap pad. After they have broken in though, they can engage ABS. Don't forget to flush your brakes when you replace your pads.I put pad quiet on 1 side, and none on the other, and I can't tell a difference between the sides."
2,"OVERATED, OVERATED, OVERATED!!!!!!!","I will admit to being very excited about seeing this movie. I had heard wonderful things about it and was excited about all the positive reviews. Boy, were they wrong. This is an overblown, self-indulgent attempt at social commentary. I do not think that it should surprise anyone that there are many racists in this country. I did not find controversy in this film. Trying to exploit an audience is there in abundance.The two stars that I give are for the performances. Ryan Phillipe and Terrence Howard steal the movie. Many of the other performances were very wooden and tired. This movie will no doubt end up on many end of the year top ten lists. But I urge those that are sceptical about this movie to STAY AWAY!!!"
4,IS RACISM THE FAD NOW???!!!,"Like most of the reviwers, it suprised me that Crash won the best awards from the Academy.The movie is GREAT but the subject is NOTHING NEW! and NOW MOST OF THE MOVIES HAVE TO INCLUDE THE RACISM SUBJECT!!! SOO THIS RACISM THING IS WAY TO REPETITIVE!!!!Not olny that: THERE IS TO MUCH ANNOYING DADDY' GIRL STUFF, the movie is WAY TO EDUCATIVE and LACKS ORIGINALITY.I put four stars because this film is very emotional and dramatic...also a social criticism but they can't always bring the same subject all over again. I know that the 9/11 thing was sadful but please! don't overtalk it!!Adios."
2,"Boring, stupid, unrealistic","Everything about this film screamed 'Please nominate me for an Oscar'. And I wasn't buying it. Everything in this movie bothered me. I never liked the 'connecting' type of movies because they almost never work, and this is no exception. It bored me and I was scoffing half the time. It really is absurd that this movie got som much recognition to begin with."
2,No subtlety at all,"I am completely at a loss why this movie won Best Picture. The concept of the film is great, but the execution of it is lacking. The plot is a complex one, interweaving many stories together to get one point across: racism is WRONG.I appreciate that the movie didn't just deal with one ethnicity's racial problems. However, I don't like how the characters were treated. They were one dimensional, just a figure to emphasize the racial tension of that particular ethnicity. The ""coincidences"" that connected each story were too cliched to be believable. And I find it difficult to believe the level of blatant racism that each person in their respective scenarios encountered.This film had so much potential, with its great cast and interesting concept. Too bad it had to beat us over the head with it."
1,"I've seen it done before, and better...much, much better","Interlocking stories, in L.A? Magnolia did it better. Racially-charged script? Spike Lee does it better. Formulaic, heavy-handed and utterly self-indulgent. This movie assumes you don't know that racism exists in America, and then treats you like an idiot for 1+ hours. The fact it won an Oscar goes to show that Hollywood continues to delude itself into believing they care about the parts of L.A. these millionaires would never go into. Crap. If I could give it zero stars, I would. Don't see, don't buy, RUN AWAY from this DVD.(I'm embarrassed Paul Haggis is Canadian.)"
4,a lesson to learn,I got the feeling from this story it was like an Aesop's fable. There was a lesson to be learned from this. Whether or not you want a lesson when you watch a movie is your choice. It is not believeable in the sense that a city as large as LA would connect such a small group of people with each other. It was an interesting and at times amusing story but it was also extremely sad. A lot happened in the movie that it really didn't allow the viewer's mind to drift even for a moment otherwise you would miss something. It is also a very American story. There are race issues all over the world but these specific stories were definitely aimed at the American viewer so from that point of view it shows non-Americans a slice of life in LA that usually is not shown in other places.
1,Vastly Overrated,"While the message of Crash is important, the film is a steady succession of having anvils dropped on your head.We get the message. This film treats its audience as if they are all idiots. It's downright insulting.From the hammy performances, to the ridiculous dialogue, to the ludicrous (no pun intended) storyline - this film shoves its message down your throat on a spoon. And believe me - you WILL gag on it."
3,I expected much more,"I bought this film because of the academy and was engaged upon my first viewing but not blown away. It's well acted, well written and very entertaining, but there is nothing absolutely nothing special about it. I have to say that after seeing it on DVD it does NOT hold up to repeat viewings, because of its simple plot and wooden characters."
1,Cynical and Depressing,"I was surprised this won best picture. It is well made, but presents a dark and overly cynical view of people. Everyone in this movie is an unpleasant stereotype: the bigot cop, the bitchy rich wife, the corrupt politician, the lazy black clinic worker, etc. The writers of this film seem to feel that people have no redeaming features."
1,waste of time,Tried to watch because of cast but only made it through about 10 minutes. Nothing but trashy language. Usually I enjoy movies with Sandra Bullock. Really sad that this won best picture.
3,CrAsH,"A classic movie of the year award winner, crash brings racism to the table and the views and antics of every races hate toward one another. with an all-star cast CrAsH is a must have for your DVD collection."
2,I have no respect for the Academy Awards.,"They have lost all credibility by giving the Best Picture award to ""Crash."" I agree with that reviewer who said that there was no plausible character development in ""Crash,"" including the Sandra Bullock character. And the ""coincidences"" in the movie were laughable.At this point, I really believe that the Golden Globes are much more reputable than the Academy Awards. At least the Golden Globes had the good sense to not even nominate ""Crash"" for Best Picture. Instead they nominated much more worthy candidates like ""Match Point,"" ""The Constant Gardener"" and ""A History of Violence."" If the Academy wasn't going to give the Best Picture award to ""Brokeback Mountain"" then it should've gone to one of those films instead. To tell you the truth, I felt ""Match Point"" and ""The Constant Gardener"" were even better than ""Brokeback Mountain."" But NOT ""Crash."""
5,Crash,Still one of the best movies I've seen. I really like movies that can incorporate several different vignettes into one common story at the end.
1,We get it already!,"Yes racism exists and what goes around comes around and all these big name stars get their name associated with a political issue no one could disagree with. They get to feel like they ""have done something good for the universe"". That's great. Life's hard enough as it is (at least for us non-stars), why do I want to pay watch this when I have to life it? Not entertainment to me"
1,Crashing ???,"What do you get if you crash together the black panthers, white supremacists, alkeda, and vatos? One of the worst racially charged movies ever made that assumes everyone is a blatant racist who mocks others . . . and your newest Academy Award for best picture???"
2,Good cast and acting but that's all.,"This is a movie that contains hate and a lot of racism. I did not get an epiphany from the plot, no extraordinary revelations, no new methods of dealing with racist situations, only talk and glorification of anger in the name of ""art"". Who needs it? Like Morgan Freeman states in his recent interview with Mike Wallace, ""...the reason we have so much racism is that we talk about it too much.""Good acting notwithstanding, more anger, more racism, more random violence in the name of ""art"" means megabucks for the actors, producers, etc. but no answers for the greater good of society. I, for one, have seen enough...I don't need to be reminded any longer that our society has a problem. The real problem is that we keep buying these movies."
4,The intersection of cultures,"This is a great story about the intersection of cultures in one city in one 36-hour period. It's actually a series of stories about ""a day in the life"" of the various otherwise unconnected characters, and how their ideas and attitudes about others and themselves play out in their daily interactions with people who are different from themselves. While highlighting some of the attitudes of the different characters and groups, it shows that racism and stereotypes are universal characteristics of human nature, rather than the problem of one or two specific groups. The film illustrates the binds created for some people because of those attitudes, and it also shows how those attitudes are either reinforced or altered by the enocunters we have with others in the world around us. Would like to have seen it go deeper into the motivations and ideas of some of the characters, but good film nonetheless. Makes one think!"
1,Worthless,"Crash, the winner of the best picture Oscar is, put quite simply, worthless. Basically some scenes thrown together of car crashes in LA and pretentious moralizing about racism. The characters (read caracatures) intertwine on the freeways of LA over race. A big step down for Don Cheadle whose excellent film Hotel Rwanda allowed his greatness as an actor to shine through. Sandra Bullock is annoying in everything she does and this is no exception. Most of the others here portray throwaway characters in unrealistic situations. Avoid this one like the plague."
2,not as great as some people make it sound,"I thought CRASH would be a great movie from all the hype I'd heard on it, but while I thought it was ok, it seemed pretty empty to me.CRASH is about racism of all kinds, not limited to just 'black and white', theres lots of cultural differences from all groups explored in this movie. But most of the problems the various characters encounter come from the fact that they're mostly just jackasses. They all act like idiots, and for the most part cause their own problems. Racism appears to get blamed for a lot of the bad events, which to me, seemed to be caused more by a lack of common courtesy/respect.There's a lot of good acting, but this movie is just basically a downer, and I don't know that it accurately represents a large portion of today's society."
1,pure propaganda,"This film attempts to convey that America is a cruel, immoral, despicable racist country. The director is too subjective and heavy-handed to be effective.I agree with other reviewers ... the makers of this film should learn that to make an effective propaganda film they need to be more subtle. It is unfathomable that this film won any kind of awards."
4,Good film; may be a bit over-rated!,"Don't get me wrong, I like this film. I do feel however that at times this film tries to come across as being real TOO HARD. I like the approach the director took in making this film, and I believe it had a very solid cast to work with, but at times the cast is what makes it seem a bit phony.The message the movie conveys is strong, and very well crafted, but at points seems a bit forced (creating tension at times, when in the real world, there would be none.) The cast as I mentioned is strong, but also a bit phony. For some reason, I find it hard to identify with the wealthy upper-class couple of Bullock and Fraser.Overall, it is a good film, and executed very well; but maybe its sold a bit more than it deserves."
1,"If it hadn't won the Oscar, I could gratefully forget about it completely","I'd give the movie itself 2 stars, for being contrived and shallow and ultimately only making one want to roll one's eyes. One star for then being overrated and unbelievably not only being nominated for Best Picture but actually winning (not to mention over 400 5 star ratings on here (?!). makes me ashamed to be an American. I have seen Brokeback Mountain as well, and while being a very heavy and depressing movie, it is far superior. A much more realistic interweaved vignette style film would be ""Brooklyn's Finest"". I didn't love that film either, but it isn't a hokey after school special at least."
2,Are they kidding me?,"I'm glad I didn't see this in the theater because I probably would have demanded my money back and the hours it took away from my life. The film is filled with so many whining, annoying, and unbelievable characters that I rolled my eyes five minutes into the film. The tv producer lets the guy who tried to hijack him go with just a warning? The lawyer and his wife complaining about ethnic people right there in front of the repairman? I'm sure the director had good intentions with this. I'm just trying to figure out what exactly they were."
3,"Overrated, Oversaturated","This movie was well talked about by nearly all of my friends, so one day I sat down with my girlfriend and watched it. In the first 20 minutes I said aloud ""Is this movie actually going to be ENTIRELY about racism?"" and lo and behold, twas indeed. If you are a person who is actually unaware of racism et cetera, educate yourself and watch this movie. Not worth buying, though. If you really want to see this just rent or borrow it.if however you live a life where you are knowledgeable about racism and don't need a Hollywood accompaniment exaggerating the happenings of every day life, my recommendation to you is: Pass. This isn't worth it. The content can't entertain, I only give it 3 stars for its related honesty and shock value as far as a movie. Are you really trying to watch a movie for honesty? Or are you simply trying to see something honestly good. If so, steer clear."
2,only skin deep,"Not a horrible movie, but I think its been overrated by many. It struck me as the brainchild of a liberal-minded filmmaker with no real profound experiences to base his ideas on. The dramatics are a bit over the top and the characters and situations just seemed false to me. As usual in Hollywood, everything gets boiled down to black vs white. All the other races seem to only be there for appearance's sake. I can't fathom how one could even suggest to be making a film about LA racial issues without giving the Hispanic experience a significant voice. And Asians only exist for a brief moment as a tool to make a black guy a hero (all while he's cracking the same stupid old asian jokes that are only okay to laugh at when a smartass young black guy is saying them). I found some aspects of the film interesting, but for the most part its just a good example of the hypocrisy, ignorance, and condescension of liberal Hollywood."
2,5 for great concept; 1 for horrible unbelievable dialogue,"5 for great concept (karma, interconnectedness of all people to one another); 1 for horrible unbelievable dialogue. The screenplay is incredible in the bad sense of the word. People don't talk like this. They don't say ""I hate you because you are __ (color)"" - they show racism through their acts.Whoever wrote this didn't understand they should show instead of putting every belief in words."
3,Round and Round,"This was a decent movie, but you will find it goes in a full circle. The ending starts the movie but right after the ""beginning"" the movie starts pretty slowly and has many obvious racism issues."
4,I enjoyed this movie,"I really enjoy story lines that separately introduce each character then unfold into how they are all connected. This is that kind of movie. Unfortunately, Amazon had poor playback quality at the time, and I ended up watching everything, except the first 20 minutes, on Netflix."
2,"Clever, overdone, annoying","The premise of our lives being intertwined is always interesting, if overused, but the interactions between the characters are overdone. Every character sports a gigantic, severly injured ego and seems ready to shoot or be shot at the drop of a hat. Every conversation is simply the prelude to a monumental, highly dramatic confrontation. This director must be on the edge. Maybe this was his stylistic intention, but it comes off as annoying and immature."
5,Eye opening,If you think you don't have any prejudices - watch Crash. It is an awesome look into the human mind.
1,Pseudo-important garbage for the simple minded popcorn muncher,"The interweaving storylines have been done many times before in film and to far greater effect.The dialogue is laugh-out-loud bad.The acting is alright, sometimes over the top - but with this shoddy material I can hardly hold it against the large cast.If you have a teeny tiny brain and need ideas handed to you on a silver platter, I recommend this film.If you are even slightly intelligent, I wouldn't bother."
4,"So real, so true.","This movie is about us, human beings. It's so realistic, and illustrates our everyday lives so naturally.Empty, hopeless feelings of people in Los Angeles, typical urban life, conflict in between rich and poor, characteristics of all types of nationalities, and justice and crime, non-stop actions and excitements....all of which are well blended throughout the movie so that kept my attention.If you like the movie ""Lost in Translation"" or ""The Matrix"", you'll love this movie!"
1,I should have read the reviews,"Let me see. I made it all of 9:32 minutes before I had to turn this pile of race-baiting trash off. I am sick and tired of putting up with all of the Hollywierd PC propaganda and the sniveling blacks. You aren't slaves anymore, except to the government welfare system. GET OVER IT and grow up."
3,could have been better,Okay I read a lot of reviews about this movie since it won so many academy awards. I kept an open mind but found this movie to lack to many things to make it as good as they said it was. First off their were memorable parts that were ruined pretty much by a following scene. I found almost all the scenes were way over the top and almost unbelievable. Typical for Hollywood but sadly this was worse than usual. Nothing stood true to life or felt even remotely realistic which I got the impression this was sort of what the director was shooting for.I'm sorry but their were far better movies dealing with race relations and shooted for a more positive message than what this movie tried to do.
1,How,"How did this win Best Picture? I rolled my eyes at least once a minute. Horrible writing. Maybe the acting was good, but everything else was too distracting for it to make a difference, or for me to even notice."
1,Too Much Vulger Language,"Never finished watching it. I could see the plot developing, but it just wasn't interesting enough. Maybe it gets better later on."
1,Bad acting and reinforces racial stereotypes,I thought it was poorly acted and did more to reinforce racial stereotypes then question and bring to light racism in America. I think it would have had more of an impact if 90% of the characters were not racist charictures
1,Bad,"Everyone seems to be a racist to these movie writers. A very cynical view of life in everyday LA. Even redemption is portrayed as fleeting. Good acting, but a bad movie with a terrible message."
4,Surprising High Quality,"Scrip-to casting- to fulfillment...a hard to watch, but stimulating and on time. Racism, sexism, and violent portrayal of human interactions in extreme situations (to most of us)."
5,"An awesome movie on a real problem in America, racism!","Crash is a great movie about race problems in the US. This movie has the great Matt Dillon and Sandra Bullock. This movie deserved the Oscar and if people hate this movie, I guess they haven't seen Boyz N the Hood and Juice as well which are also great movies. This movie is a must-see and if you choose Brokeback Mountain over this you will be bird feed!"
3,Crash good not great,"Crash is a good movie - not great.Everyone in the movie tends to emote whatever they are feeling at the time, damn be the consequences. Everyone is hair-triggered.In real life people tend to be self conscious, careful, and somewhat held back even when upset.In real life when someone flies off the handle others around them tend to stand back, observe, and not get sucked in.The one character in the movie that doesn't lash out - the man who's daughter was shot at - should have lashed out. In real life the shooter would have been beaten senseless.Thus the movie is carefully crafted to yank the viewers chainsat strategic points, manipulating the results counter to our expectations.When a movie maker hanks my chain I know it's just a movie and I leave the experience unsatisfied. Kim"
5,"So much happens, you almost have to see it more than once...","I've never seen a movie which not only addresses racism so completely and from so many angles, but also manages to tie many separate stories together perfectly, without being confusing or unrealistic.Relevant and eye-opening, yet full of edge-of-your-seat action. I believe people of all ages, cultures and backgrounds can both enjoy and benefit from seeing this movie."
4,Not Oscar worthy,"After all the hype, I finally got a chance to see CRASH. Yes, the acting was good. The story was also very good, but lets face it, CRASH had nothing new to tell us. It was the same old story about racism. I'm not saying these things don't still happen, because I know they do. The scene where Matt Dillon saved the life of the woman he'd previously molested was very touching, and the reason I gave the movie four stars. But even that scene couldn't induce me to give it five stars. I am glad I watched it, and would probably watch it again, but I don't believe it deserved the Best Picture Oscar."
1,A Total Crock,"What a total crock of pure unadulterated doggy doo!!!!! This movie has no decernable plot. It's supposedly about white racism in Los Angles but all I saw was black racism toward whites. The movie supposedly stars Sandra Bullock, however, she is only seen four times, for a total of maybe 10 minutes during the entire movie. She must be getting hard up for parts. I didn't recognize any of the other so called actors or actresses. Don't waste your money on this movie."
4,"PROVOCATIVE FILM REMINISCENT OF ""GRAND CANYON""","While I thoroughly enjoyed this film, I found stark similarities with the 1992 film ""Grand Canyon"" directed by Lawrence Kasdan....1) Both films are set in Los Angeles2) Both feature a racially diverse ensemble cast3) Both films share a central theme of racial prejudice and the inevitable results4) Both films share a directorial ""stylized"" vision of events, shot in a very similar look5) the pacing of both films very similar..."
2,totally contrived,"Total overkill. How often do we need to be beaten over the head with scene after scene of racism? How contrived is it that the characters in every scene somehow are related to the characters in the next scene, previous scene and in the end, everyone is affected by everyones actions. Yeah, I understand that that is the point of the movie but the coincidences were a little convienient. This thing plays like a made for tv movie. Also, Sandra Bullock is so absolutely awful in this movie. Just like every other movie she is in."
1,Brokeback Mountain (Better Film),"I can't believe Crash one out to Brokeback Mountain, I'll never pay attention to awards any longer."
5,who is this guy below me?,"I don't know what your problem is but I also watched Crash, and found it to be very real. You've never been walking down the street and something uncomfortable comes along and you cringe. The ""f-word"" is a common word. People say it often. Therefore it makes sense in this film. If you watch the ROCK with Sean Connery you'll hear the F-word a bunch more and then you'll probably die from shock that people actually speak like that.back to the film. Crash was a powerful film and totally deserved to win best picture. I found myself shocked at the attrocities of human nature, and the fact that most of this takes place near me made it even more real. A very powerful and visceral experience I recommend at least renting this film to see what all the hoopla is about."
5,CRASH WAS DEFINETELY THE BEST FILM OF 2006,CRASH was definetely the best film of 2006 and you need to see a therapist if you are not convinced.A GREAT MOVIE BY A MILE.
5,Forget Brokeback Mountain...see Crash...,"Forget Brokeback Mountain. Never have I been subjected to 2 hours and 30 minutes of torture. Watching this movie was a serious improvement. This movie actually has a plot, and while it not be very strong, it is extremely emotional and a little bit scary. Nothing makes me happyier to know that movie got best picture over BM, so watch this and forget Brokeback Mountain, the worst movie of 2005. Also highly reccomended is King Kong, another movie that actually deserved awards..."
2,"Over rated movie, Oscar win ??? no competition !!!","Wow , having just watched this movie last night on DVD, I was blown away by the lack of substance in this movie... I was expecting to come away with deep feelings about race and class and instead came away feeling robbed and cheated !!! I feel the whole story was weak, What the heck was Don Cheadle doing ??? I love him as an actor , but he was given nothing to work with in this movie..and while i'm at it ,, what the hell was the point of Sandra Bullocks character ?? i supposed i'll be black balled for my review by other Amazon users but i feel strongly that this movie could never compete with a Shawshank Redemption which didn't win the Oscar 12 years ago..."
1,Ineffective Propaganda Film,"This film is an attempt to propagandize about how racist America is. But it is too unreal and heavy-handed to be effective. You would have to live in another country or be a politically correct, brainwashed zombie to be able to watch this flick and nod your head.The makers of this film should learn that, in order to make an effective propaganda film, they should be more subtle. It is easier to fool and manipulate people that way. When you try to hit the viewer over the head with a sledgehammer, as the makers of this film have done, only the most ignorant of viewers will be so enamoured of the movie as to give it a five star rating at Amazon."
2,"silly & pretentious twiddle, but arent we significant?","overrated and overwrought, but i guess the academy felt very good about itself in voting this obvious piece of relevance the best picture oscar that ""brokeback"" deserved. i figured out every twist and turn long before it happened, and i am tired of los angeles as a character; when the film noir guys were doing it 60 years back, it was creative -- now its just silly. strong performances in support of a cloddish script raised it from one star to two."
1,Rubbish !,"Despite good acting performances this film deserves NONE of the accolades it received.... it's basically RUBBISH for the simple sake of trying to be controversial.Forget racial tension issues... all the characters in this film deserve what happens to them NOT because of the supposed ""deep racial expose"" reasons the film is supposed to be so praised for representing.... instead they deserve the misfortune they receive due to erratic stupid behaviourm, being hot-headed, mouthy and emotional instead of logical and composed.They all create their own problems mostly due to poor manners and behaviour independent of racial identity."
2,"Certainly not ""Best Picture""...","The overbearing problem with this film is the dialogue - almost ALL lines in the screenplay are packed with a racial slur or over-the-top prejudice - so much so that gone is any identification with the characters whatsoever. Gone also is any sympathy for virtually all characters. I never felt engaged.I see the intent of the structure of this film, but I thought the entire second half was incoherent and, as a result of a sequence of unrelated scenes, I felt like this movie ended 7 times before the credits actually began to roll.The strength of this film is it's ability to highlight chance, karma, fate, etc playing a part in one's life. However, it just didn't quite work for me. I've seen better cinematic explorations of racial issues, most of them without the big-name actors to cameo, distract, and deliver such poor dialogue in this mediocre film."
2,Mediocre,"A thoroughly mediocre film about the prevalence of racism at all levels of modern-day urban society. The film stretches credulity to the breaking point with its densely packed coincidences. The film abandons any pretense of subtlety and instead opts for a more overt, hammer upon the head technique.A disappointing choice for best picture, especially with respect to its co-nominees."
1,"Terrible, Simply Terrible","This is absolutely the worst movie I have seen, but mostly because the only reason that compelled me to rent this DVD is because of the Oscar's award it earned.Terrible, I can't believe I wasted my time on this junk"
3,my two cents,"Just had one short comment about the film:As a woman, I disliked how the movie dealt with the sexual assault of the African-American woman by the racist police officer. I thought the movie took that way too lightly. The officer was portrayed as a savior later in the film and was never held accountable for what he did, which disturbed me. Just my opinion."
3,Movie: Flawless - Blu-Ray: Debatable,"I cannot fault this movie and I class it as a piece of cinematic history.This movie hit nerves that I didn't know existed, it is a movie that everyone should see. I own the DVD versions of the movie and I obviously wanted the Blu-Ray edition for my collection. After comparing this to other titles I was disappointed by the quality of the picture on this particular disc. Whether this was because of poor encoding, transfer, master etc or the fact that it was one of the first generation Blu-Ray discs to be released I don't know. The sound was good even though not in PCM 5.1, (it has an amazingly haunting soundtrack) - however that aside this movie is NOT to be missed. 3 stars for the Blu-Ray Disc and 5 stars for the movie."
2,Crash,I am not sure what I thought this movie was going to be like but i was very disappointed in it. I thought it was very harsh. and i realize that was probably because he was portraying real life situations that make it even more disturbing to watch.
2,Hard to watch all the way through,Not sure why I watched it all the way to the end - it's like one long train wreck that you want to turn away from and can't seem to do it.
3,My review of Crash,"The movie was different, but it was interesting. I thought the use of the F-bomb was too much throughout the movie. I would have given it 4 stars except for that."
3,okay movie,"lots of language, mutliple plots overral good movie, not great or a must see. Sandra bullock has much better movies"
1,Not good at all,Terrible movie. Not at all one that I would recommend to any body anywhere. I wish I had never watched it.
2,crash disappointment,I had expected from a movie with Sandra Bullock in it. I kept waiting for it to pick up. disappointed
3,manipulative trash,"I can appreciate any film that attempts to explore racism in america. I can't, however, suspend my disbelief enough to swallow this manipulative attempt to make me feel something for these characters. Each character, unintentionally, i believe, ends up being its own stereotype. That, combined with the ridiculous string of coincidences that tie the whole story together make me feel like inserting my finger to the depths of my throat. I cant believe so many people bought this drivel. This movie was like a ""very special episode"" of the much better movie it could have been. If mcdonalds commercials with grandparents having special moments with their grandkids touch you, so will this film. Capote was a million times better and should have won best picture. this film is trash."
5,thought from the shadow side of the mind!,"Yes! granted we are in the 21st centrey,but a lot of individuals in this country and around the world still hold hidden racial expectation of people of different ethnicity from there own.When a white person sees a black person somewhere in the background of their thoughts the ""N"" word whispers!Or when a black individual sees a white person the word ""CRACKER"" whispers in the background!How about when u see a miidle eastern person nothing whispers in the background of your mind!Honesty is hard when it comes to racism."
1,Crash,"I rented this DVD a few days ago and had no intention of writing a review because I figured I had wasted enough time on this joke of a movie. However, I watched the Academy Awards tonight and I'm sick. How this movie won best picture is something I will never understand. This movie reminded me of a later day version of All In The Family, minus the actors and the comedy. Within the first hour of putting the DVD into the player, I was falling asleep. I stopped the player and started the film again,from the beginning, when I woke up. I kept watching this film thinking something exciting was going to happen. The only thing exciting were the closing credits. Boring is not the word for this film. I can give my honest opinions as to why this film was picked as best picture but I will keep them to myself. I will say this, I have no intention of watching these awards shows again. If they wish to make a statement then they can do it on their own time. I have better things to do for over 3 hours."
1,Waste of my time,"This movie made me think how far Hollywood has to go to appear to have some substance and be intouch with reality. This contrived social flick is supposed to get people talking about race and social conflict. Forget it. I thought the whole conflct-race-religion delimma, as superficial as it was, failed to deliver anything worth the price of the DVD. Superficial, silly, and predictable. I will give it a one star as I could clean my office and go through my files and not miss a beat in the movie.Sorry, I just did not find this movie worthy of my time, let alone an award. However, my office is cleaner."
2,"Depressing, Frustrating, Watch if you have no faith in humanity","I rented this movie because it was on both Ebert and Roepers top 10 of the year list. I thought the story was terrible. It has all the mis-communications typical of a ""Three's Company"" episode. Every race, occupation, and persons of different economic positions are shown in the worst possible light. I know people aren't this stupid and cruel. The academy should not reward this foolishness..."
2,Please don't fall for the hype,"This movie makes some nice moral points but overall it is boring, tedious, the dialogue is unreal, and you will need to fast forward through numerous scenes. The movie hits you with a sledgehammer that all of Los Angeles or maybe even the USA is angry, racist, isolated, etc. A lighter touch might have made it more pallable."
3,Good - yes Great - no Best Picture - just kidding,"This is a good movie, interesting and acted well (mostly). As a best picture, there's no way. I'm not sold on BBM (give me Good Night and Good Luck) but there's no way can Crash be considered as the best of 2005. The story line was predictable and plodding and way more full of coincidence than meaning. The speeches were more like lectures delivered in a beginning script writing class. Still can't understand why the writing oscar as well. Check out how Crash is rated on rottentomatoes and metacritics and see if it holds up as the best picture. And the music absolutely stunk - easily the worst of the year."
4,Amazing,"This movie touches up on a lot of stereotypes in today's society. Crash tackles racism in many different forms. The actors are right on point. Each character is brilliantly acted. The scripting is okay...however...it does get a little repetitive after a while. That seems to be the movie's biggest flaw. Otherwise, it's a great film. Highly recommended :)"
2,Mimics 'Right Thing' in LA. But Like 'Right Thing'...,"...it provokes but does not necessarily offer solutions. There may not be any. One thing to it's merit is that Crash touches upon the great interconnectiveness of all peoples with it's storyline and mood. The acting is okay, but anyone given this provocative, bombastic script could look like a decent actor. I prefer the movie Traffic (also starring Cheadle), which it also references, to this."
1,Amazingly horrible film,"Talk about a melodramatic pile of drivel.Crash is a completely trite, contrived, overtly racist movie where the characters are caricatures of racial stereotyping at its finest. This movie drives the point home, so far home it went down the toilet and into the septic tank.""Racism is bad.""Yes, we all know that, but after watching this film your racist way of thinking might not be subdued. No, in fact it might grow and make you become more racist; which is NOT what this movie's message is about.Also, this movie tries so hard to pull at our heartstrings, but if you're able to defy its attempts, you'll see that Crash is nothing more than a poorly-made film with no redeeming factors whatsoever."
5,This hit to close to home.,"I loved to whole set up and feel of this movie. The acting was just great. Even Sandra Bullock (ok actress) did some of the best acting she has ever done. The movie truly deserved every award it won. I may not know the pain of a [...] cowboy, but I do know the pain of being a woman of color."
1,Are You Kidding Me?,"Every year there's a film that critics fall all over for no apparent reason. It was Mystic River in 2004, and Crash is that film for 2005. Fake, contrived, and at times just plain ridiculous - with sometimes laughable performances from a grossly overrated cast (Bullock in particular). It's pretty hard to understand how anyone could buy this schlock...- cRAIG"
1,SICK MOVIE THAT MERITS ZERO STARS!!,"This is another ""realistic"" depiction of the depravity of society. I want to be entertained...not have ""real life"" thrown in my face. I get enough of it every day! This movie is sick, sick, sick, sick, sick!!"
2,"Love the Movie, Not happy with the Quality","The movie is great, but the second time I took it out of the case, it cracked. The case has a firm grip and the light weight CD, split on one side easily. So I own it but I can't watch again."
1,Overhyped garbage,"I'll keep this short and to the point. I was told by numerous people that I had to see this film(?). What a waste of time. This is not Magnolia, Short Cuts, or Pulp Fiction. I truly hated this movie. There are many other fine films out there that portray rascism and hatred in a much more realistic and heartbreaking way."
1,Too Crazy to Take Seriously,This movie is really far out. I have never seen dialogue that is so unrealistic. How stupid can people be to be able to take such a film seriously?
1,NICE TRY BUT ULTIMATELY PHONY,"The writers get away with murder in this contrived bit of racial political incorrectness. They use every racial epithet possible in a attempt to show how NON MELTING the pot is in Los Angeles (And America in General). Good acting almost saves this film but the coincidences are unbelieveable and Thandie Newton( A superb actress) can't save a totally riduclous scene in which she is trapped in a burning car and screaming ""Dont touch me"",the phoniest scene in an pretentious film that falls far short of its goals. The fact that is lost the Oscar to ""Brokeback Moutain"" is something future generations will ponder and probably laugh about."
1,SOOO overrated...,"Here's the best way to express my feelings about this ridiculously overrated movie. A quote from LA Weekly film critic Scott Foundas writing for Slate.com:""Welcome to the best movie of the year for people who like to say, 'A lot of my best friends are black.'""Don't buy this dvd. Buy 13 Conversations About One Thing. It's the same general idea, but with some sense and subtlety. Crash has neither and just delights in racial epithets. Congratulations, Paul Haggis, you know a lot of dirty words. Too bad you can't write above a fifth-grade level."
2,We're All Racists???? Who Knew???!!!,"To judge by this movie, everybody but Hollywood. Crash reminded me of nothing so much as American Beauty, a beautiful to look at, urgently made, and ultimately empty piece of work. Yes, the acting is fine; yes, the intercutting between characters works; yes, some of the dialogue is entertaining (e.g. when the hijack duo banter about hockey and the Staples Center) but it's all using a sledgehammer and stock characters and emotions to make the point -- again and again and again -- that racism is alive and well in the 21st century. This is news?Jon Stewart jibed that Hollywood is out of touch. Despite George Clooney's riposte, Crash and its Oscar validates Stewart's point -- the Academy awards itself for bravely discovering what is old news to every other sentient being, implying in the moralizing that Hollywood itself is different. The ugly squabble about who gets producer credit for Crash nicely exposes that conceit."
3,Uninspired and self-indulgent,"Racism is alive. But you probably already knew that. If you didn't, well then Crash is fantastic. But if you'd rather not be lectured at for 1+ hours about it, skip this flick. It's uninspired. It yells at the viewer rather than trying to SHOW the viewer its message. Instead of imparting its theme through subtle metaphor, the director chooses to browbeat the audience. The plot is utterly predictable.Despite its shortcomings, though, the structure of the movie is a good concept. I've always enjoyed when multiple plot lines overlap (e.g., Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels). Terrence Howard also turns in a fantastic performance, making his character into one of the few that is more than a cardboard cut-out.Entertaining, maybe. Great? Far from it.If you're looking for a good, intellectually stimulating Oscar picture, try Good Night and Good Luck. Sure, it browbeats the audience with anti-McCarthyism, but then again...the message isn't really about McCarthyism anyway."
1,Do the Right thing and don't waste your time with this movie.,"Instead go buy DO THE RIGHT THING, a film by Spike Lee so you can see a film that deals with these same themes in a far more powerful and impactful way. It won't make you feel good, it won't make you pat yourselfon the back for going to see it, and it won't make you proudly proclaim to your one black friend that you went to see it. Its a film that sparks real conversation not heavy handed sympathy."
4,Wow,This movie pushes every button possible. And the way it all comes full circle is simply amazing. I like the story. I like the acting. I like the characters. I hate the hate!
5,Will make you open minded,"I really enjoyed Crash and how intertwined seemingly unrelated people can become through one simple incident. The main point of the story is that racism is bad, but it never hurts to reminded, especially with how well it is done in this film. If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and watch it."
3,Rental Only,"It's a fine movie but doesn't hold up well on repeated viewings. Dialogue at times is clunky and awkward, it can be very heavy-handed in its treatment of racism. Stay away if you are allergic to a petulant Sandra Bullock"
1,Too Unreal to be Taken Seriously,"This film is perhaps the worst movie ever to win an Academy Award for ""Best Film."" It comes across more like a parody of a politically correct propaganda film, but the problem is that the Canadian film-maker meant this to be taken seriously. (Why couldn't he stay in his native country if he hates ours so much?)"
1,Director's Cut re-issue is non-sense,"Lions Gate really wanted to release a new Director's Cut with only 3 minutes of extra reel, didn't they? As a moviegoer who has admired Crash for what it was, I have to say that the marketing push has gotten over the top. This DVD is worth it if you didn't purchase the first copy, but let me tell you that this product is a complete waste of money for those unfortunate fans who think they are getting a full-package deal with this new, ""you-have-to-get-it"" DVD that they call Director's Cut, but really is just the same DVD case with a few changes wrapped in a new cover. I'm not impressed."
1,Crash and burn,"Let me preface this by saying that even though I wasn't moved at all when I first rented this movie, I gave it another chance by renting it again. I'm sorry to say I was even more put off by it the second time around. I read somewhere that if you really want to see an accurate depiction of racism in America, turn your eyes to the footage from the devastation of Katrina. I truly believe that. ""Crash"" played it safe, it was riddled with clichés, and quite frankly, it was highly unbelievable by any stretch of the imagination. That it was given an Academy Award for Best Picture is a joke -- every other picture in that category deserved it over ""Crash,"" including some that were not even nominated. I think the cinematography was wonderful, and the score was haunting, but Oscar or no Oscar, it is anything but a classic. Ultimately, it's not even a good movie."
1,"""....And the Oscar goes to.........'Crap'!...er....'Crash'!""","I think previous (negative) reviews have said it all. While the film is ambitious in scope, well-shot, intricately staged...nicely lit, it ultimately fails to communicate anything except the screenwriter's and director's stilted, unevolved, often sophomoric understanding of race relations.I think I showed remarkable restraint in not walking out of the theater when in one of the opening scenes we were bombarded with the most brain-dead, too-stupid-to-even-be-called-insulting derogatory racial stereotypes I have been exposed to since the 7th grade. Really, a police detective making fun of a Chinese woman's inability to pronounce her ""L's"" and ""R's""? Wow, if that passes for deep commentary on 21st Century race relations I guess I had learned all I needed to know about the topic around time I had to get used to a school day without recesses."
1,Don't Waste Your Time or Money,"This film is, without question, one of the most ridiculously contrived messes ever made. It was carefully populated with a ""diverse"" selection of characters in a manner that could be considered quaint if done by a (very) young child but is instead an embarrassment to everyone involved. Regarding the coincidences of the same two people crossing each other's paths in a city as large and populous as LA . . . the filmmakers must be kidding. If you turn on your television and select channels at random, you can bet that the first (and indeed any) movie that you find will be less insulting to one's intelligence than Crash."
1,THROW THIS MOVIE IN THE GARBAGE CAN!,"Bought this movie since, supposedly, it is the Oscar winner, and can I just say YUCK! It cultivate NO human emotion, just a series of disturbing actions. It is the worst movie I have seen this year. THROW THIS MOVIE AWAY! No one ever want to see it again."
5,required viewing for cops,"I teach in a police academy and I had the new recruits watch this film. Not only is it an outstanding film but delivers a powerful message. All too often we forget how our actions impact other people and how our prejudices guide us. This film brings that into focus and leaves the viewer examing their own prejudices and viewpoints.Message aside, the film is well done and the acting is outstanding. It should be required viewing for all new police recruits as well as all of soceity."
1,"Crash - great story, lousy blu ray",The story line of Crash is fantastic and the acting is very good. It takes several viewings to get the intricacies of the story and well worth the repitition. We have this on DVD and love it. I am adding blu rays to my collection for what I consider exceptional movies. I am very disappointed in the quality of this blu ray. The sound is out of synch with the picture - enough to toss it right away. But even more disturbing is it is not 1080p quality - the DVD looks better on my blu ray than this does. Guess they are getting funding from this poor one to produce the true blu ray version - reminds me of the early DVDs that were just remakes from the VHS tapes.
5,There is a Chinaman under the car,"This is the best movie i saw in 2005. Great writing, directing, acting, fast paced and intelligent.We are not who we think we are, black is not different from white, there are laws of life that an alert soul may recognize and follow - or not, sez the film. No stereotypes here, just imperfect people caught in situations that you and me have been and will be caught in in the future. How will we respond? Who are we anyway? That split second will tell."
4,WOW,"What a great movie....nothing like I have ever seen.This Movie totally will get you thinking about your own life and how you percieve people, and how we judge people by their apperances....(don't judge a book by its cover!!!)"
5,(CRASH) Total Trash,"This is a complete waste of time and the worst peice of politically correct propaganda garbage you will ever see. If this has any semblance of reality to life in L.A. It's no wonder California is Bankrupt. If you can get through 10 minutes of this film you deserve a medal of some kind, or a Labotomy. I gave it 5 Stars but it deserves a less than zero."
5,Must See,"This movie has a very good plot, it has alot of character that don't seem to go together but in the end it all makes sense. It will grip you heart and keep you on the edge of your seat."
1,"crash, indeed","When this film won 'best picture' I nearly fell out of my chair. How could a movie so badly written, so unoriginal, so contrived, so obnoxiously acted, win over ""Brokeback Mountain"" or ""Munich""? If you want to see an excellent film on racial tensions and predjudice, see ""Grand Canyon"", not this drivel."
4,"Modern Day ""Its a Wonderful Life""","The movie starts off with ""Its a Wonderful Life"" on a movie marquee above characters heads as they stroll down the sidewalk so you sort of know what to expect. Still the movie is very interesting and very well acted, many fine performances by an eclectic cast, highly recommend."
4,Good movie,"What a cast! My wife and I watched this movie together, and she found it kinda hard to follow. I found it quite worth the effort. Loved how all of the pieces fit together in the end."
3,confusing movie,"bunch of convoluted actions put together. If this is Los Angeles, glad I don't have to do anything with it, LOL."
5,MOST AMAZING,"THIS Movie I think all people in America should see. THIS MOVIE WAS SO EMOTIONAL THAT I WALKED OUT BECAUSE THIS hit home with me because I as an AFRICAN AMERICAN I HAVE EXPERIENCED THOSE SITUATIONS IN THE MOVIE. This movie made me SAD, MAD AND IT MADE ME CRY. TO THINK THAT THIS IS THE 21ST CENTURY AND THIS STILL HAPPENS IS APPALLING. THIS IS A MUST SEE MOVIE....OH YEA I DID GO BACK AND FINISH WATCHING THE MOVIE.Greg Lassiterwww.misguidedproduction.com"
1,A quick review of the DIRECTOR'S CUT.,"I have seen this new ""Director's Cut"" and it is only THREE minutes longer than the original. I can't even tell you what the difference was.I liked this movie, but this re-release is just plain greedy on the part of the studio.And shame on Antonio Villaraigosa for letting a studio buy our city for a day to promote this rip-off.ONE STAR!"
2,So Lost. I don't get it.,Just watched this movie and I am totally lost. I figured all these characters would eventually be connected at some point. But the ending seemed to be thrown together at the last minute.I can't believe this film won the Best Picture Oscar. Had to be guilt on Academy's part.
1,Crash is trash!,"Reasons why this movie sucks:1) Didn't get Asian accents right - Gave Koreans Chinese accents. This is like depicting French people with Italian accents.2) Horrible, cheesy dialogue.3) Devoid of gay cowboys.4) New age music accompanying slo-mo scenes.5) Condescending and preachy.6) Annoying characters."
1,"SICK, SICK, SICK!!!!!","I agree that this was a sick movie. But then Hollywood is a sick town, anyhow. To think that it won Best Picture only proves that the Oscars are just a bunch of political hoopla....if this is this year's best picture, I'd hate to see the runner's up!!"
5,Crashing Through,"There are few movies in life that are ""experiences""~ where the audience does not walk out of the theater, but staggers out. ""Crash"" is one of those rare gems that always haunts the imagination, because it does crash into all of us. I had no desire to watch this film, but relented simply because it won the Oscar. I saw every other movie nominated that year, and none come close to ""Crash"": it is a story of race, redemption, anger, awareness, and ultimately, the neighborhoods we live in. In the slightest of roles, Tony Danza captures the gritty reality of race expectations. His minor role is a snapshot of the other players in the film (Sandra Bullock as a snotty bitch?? Beautifully played....)This film not only should bask in the glory of the Oscar, but move onto AFI's top 100 movies of all time. Yeah, it's that good."
3,Crash,"I went back and forth about giving ""Crash"" a 3 or 4-star rating (wish there was a 3.5 rating), but eventually went with the 3 simple because I didn't think this film lived up to its hype. That being said, I think ALL the actors in the movie did an incredible job, it was story the lost it for me. All character's lives and interactions are related to one another (similar to ""Love Actually""). Ryan Phillipe is wonderful and I wish he'd do more movies. Terrence Howard lives up to his hype as well and Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges makes a surprising debut. While I thought there were better movies made in 2005, I certainly would have given ""Crash"" the Oscar over the other nominees. I am sure I am one of the few people who didn't give this movie a 4 or 5 star rating, but still I recommend that you see this movie, if not buy it. For me I think this movie was just over-hyped for my expectations."
2,I'm glad they made it,"It's surprising to see Hollywood make a film in which racism is the major theme. That the movie simplifies the topic and relies mostly on insane coincidence and two dimensional characters to tell the story is not surprising. Here's the movie: Character 1 screams a racial epithet. Character 2 screams a racial epithet back. Through some ridiculous happenstance the character is either redeemed or has something terrible happen to them. At the end everything is solved and wrapped up nicely. The only piece of illuminating information in the film is that Los Angeles is the most hateful city on the planet, and everyone there is extremely upfront and confrontational with their prejudices and hatred of the other races around them. I just hope the success of the film leads to more movies that deal with racism in a more realistic way, and that are actually thought provoking and humane."
5,Collision Course of Prejudice,"""Crash"" puts you in an uncomfortable position that you just can't adjust, with prejudice in the driver's seat. It's the most realistic movie I've seen in a long time and that is a sad fact for Americans. The movie depicts biases so accurately and without any sugarcoating, that I now require it at Rutgers for my ""Culture and Crime"" class, during the race and crime segment."
3,Watched it for a class,My son had to watch this film for a class. The film makes a good point about prejudice and stereotypes. There is a lesson to be learning. I don't think all the cursing was needed though.
2,Crash Review,I chose this rating because it is not a full screen showing. It is very difficult to view widescreen! Purchasers should be informed before making the purchase!
5,timely delivery,"Amazon is the best place to order from for your every need. My item arrived by the promised date which was just in time for Christmas. I trust the merchandise sold on Amazon as it has always been of good quality and the prices are the best. For me, there is no better place to shop."
2,Blah!,"I never really knew what the movie was about. I didn't see the movie when it came out, didn't see it before the awards show. We borrowed it to watch and I didn't like it. I guess the story line was good, because of the fact that that is exactly how the world is with people judging others because of their race, where they come from etc..I won't ever watch the movie again. The movie is different stories of different people. Sandra Bullock has hers, Matt Dillon has his etc..Just not a movie to put in and watch over again. Just a one timer!"
2,Too Much Work,"If you are one of those people that really likes to work hard at trying to follow a movie, then this one is for you. It tracks about a dozen different storylines involving about two or three dozen different characters, back and forth across an impossible to order collection of timelines and all of that is supposed to come together in the end to make a sensible movie with a singular and logical plot. Personally, I don't like those kinds of movies so I gave up on this one after the first half hour. Tedious, boring and exceptionally disordered. Good luck......"
1,Hated it,"I am sorry but I am not into racism. I could not believe that Sandra Bullock even played in it. This movie was so stupid it is unreal. A cop trying to rape a woman in front of her husband, and then he had to tell her the next day or two when she was in a wreck that she needs to trust him. Ryan thinking a black boy was trying to kill him, shot the boy who was trying to show him something that they both have. He was a cop in the show and what he should have done was tell the boy he was a cop when he picked the boy up hitching a ride. Brandon was just to high class for my taste. He needs to stick w/ comedies. That is his strong suit. There is quite a few other big names but the bottom line rent it first before you buy it. I really wish I would had done that. I don't think it was worth my money."
3,"statement on racism, predjudice & assumptions","If you are looking for a thought provoking movie to illustrate the assumptions we make based on race and background, this is it!! If you are looking for entertainment, action or great story-telling, keep shopping. I really liked this movie because of the realization and understanding it gave me about gender, race and predjudice."
5,"Jean: ""I am angry all the time... and I don't know why.""","CRASH is one HECK of a Christmas film! It's also the very first movie shot and set in Los Angeles to win a Best Picture Oscar.It features a fine ensemble cast in a multi-layered story that's bursting with anger, hatred, resentment, suspicion, prejudice and violence. With all that darkness, there's still more than one miracle here. Not easy to watch, but infinitely rewarding. Highest recommendation.Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.(8.0) Crash (USA/Germany-2004) - Sandra Bullock/Don Cheadle/Tony Danza/Matt Dillon/Jennifer Esposito/Brendan Fraser"
4,Terrific premise and performances,"What a great movie this almost was. For the first 60 minutes, this movie was riveting, powerful, and believable. The last 50 some minutes, well, it turns a little bit Hollywood. Haggis doesn't completely sell out, but he takes some of the heat off, and as a result the believability factor drops just enough for it to not deserve five stars. Matt Dillon and Don Cheadle are at the top of their games, as is Michael Pena and the young girl who plays his daughter. But Sandra Bullock seems uncomfortable in a supporting role, and Brendan Fraser is a bit invisible as the politically ambitious DA. Definitely worth seeing. Belongs in the Grand Canyon catalog."
1,"Movie not that great, I would rather watch something else!!!","First of all, I thought it was a rip off of something that Quintin Tarintino would do. Some story lines of the characters had closer and some didn't. It was movie on ""ist"" showing; Racist, Sexist, etc. In reality it just showed stupidity. The movie showed one side of a character wanting you to hate them, and then later they show a better side. Until you see what I mean in the movie, I don't know what what the director had in mind if he wanted you to like of dislike certain people. This is my opinion on the movie, it wasn't a favorite for me."
1,Crash,"What a confusing flick! It may all come together in the end, but not in a way that I understand. How could this ever win over ""Brokeback Mountain""? Brokeback is so much better in everyway and probably would have won the Oscar if it weren't for the Academy's fear of backlash (which obviously isn't happening)."
1,"""Brokeback Mountain"" is a better movie","The people at the voting Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences hate homosexuals and are too timid to award Ang Lee's fearless love epic, ""Brokeback Mountain,"" the Best Picture Oscar. To cover up their homophobic attitudes while maintaining a PC image, they voted for ""Crash,"" a condescending, self-important ""commentary"" on racism that has NO appreciation for subtlety. It's lightweight melodrama for phony liberals. The Academy should be ashamed of itself for awarding such garbage. Do the right thing and wait for ""Brokeback"" to hit DVD."
1,"IT'S ONLY ME, BUT:",GOD THIS WAS AN AWFULL MOVIE. I KEPT WATCHING IT HOPING IT GOT BETTER AS IT WON SO MANY ACADEMY AWARDS. IT DID NOT. A STORY ABOUT 5 DIFFERENT CRASH SCENES AND HOW THE PEOPLE REACT ALL IN THE SAME NIGHT. A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY. JM
3,Well made entertaining but overall questionable,"This movie was entertaining and well made. I have to give it that. Though it leaves me and my fellow viewer with the question ""Does this movie make a point that personal responsibility is second to enviromental influences?"" You are to feel sorry for the gangbanger whose a car jacker or the racist cop because no matter what they do its not thier fault. Big PC copout movie."
4,Good Movie,"This was a great film that took a deep look at the racism, steriotypes and misconceptions that suround us everywhere. The fear of others and the fear of the unknown show that, although different on the outside, people are more similar than they thought. The steriotypes and racism is not going to go away, but if that is the foundation for someone's actions and beliefs, then it will make for some messy situations. As for how the film was set up, the characters have individual lives and stories that blended together brilliantly. It shows how everyone is self concerned and never thinks or don't care that their actions will affect others."
4,"Overall good, but a little exaggerated",The story line was good and the meshing of lives was done well. We rented this since many people recommended it. We felt it was a little too exaggerated in some parts (things that would not likely occur to that extreme) which made the movie a little unbelievable.
3,Crazy Movie,"Crash is a crazy movie. There were several different stories that came together somehow in the end. It was confusing in the beginning, but once you figure out that the title is 'Crash' for a reason, the pieces all sort of come together.There are a lot of famous actors in the movie, so I thought it was going to be horrible. But I was wrong. I always believed that when a bunch of good actors were put in the same movie, it tends to [...]. Well, at least I used to think so.It was definitely worth watching.Candice B.[...]"
5,Great Movie!,"This really is a great movie that everyone living in the 21st century should watch. Race relations, not only in Los Angeles, but all over the world effect our daily lives and this movie show's it as raw and real as is the world we live in. Great actors, combined with a true to life story makes for one spectacular movie. I highly recommend it."
3,defocusing the big theme,Many good (decent) actors were casted for no reason. that'd be nice if the director cut or extended version is released to show the further details. Kinda disappointed.
5,bedazzled,"A man, whose a little on the goofy side, makes a deal with the devil. If Elizabeth Hurly was the devil, I think there'd be a lot of men wanting to go to hel"
4,Good but not an uplifter,A good story about the stereotypes in our society with great acting but definitely don't watch if you are looking for a feel good movie.
5,great movie,"This movie has so many messages about racism--how it happens and and how we deal with it--and the sometimes crippling ways that we respond to the situations and people in our lives. This is my second time watching it. I think that I could watch it 3 or 4 more times and get some news insight each time. It's a hard movie to watch, but it's a great movie."
4,Exhilirating plot,"Very Much Liked How it unfolded. It Kept One guessing on how it would tie in.Got an emotional rise on the race issue. F.E.A.R. False Evidence Appearing Real Syndrome Exercised.I.E. One was really there in the scene because of justified F.E.A.R. to similar misperceived racial confrontation.The Blank Bullets. Well, Wow! How a story to a little girl expresses and culminates the Law. The Law of Attraction."
4,crash,pretty good movie.hesitated once lots of good actors. was a good choice. wouln't watch it again. was first movie. thanks
4,It was a good movie,"I enjoyed the plot- the twists and the turns, and I'd watch it again. I'm glad I chose this title."
1,unnecessarily stereotypical,"The real challange for a story like this would have been to convey the same message WITHOUT extreme, almost cartoon-unbelievable, stereotypes. This movie will provoke much positive sentiment, but what it really represents is a challange to filmmakers to create more subtle less insulting messages about everyday social problems."
5,One Out of Four,"Not since White Man's Burden has a film hit this hard. Writer/director Paul Haggis captures the current state of racism with biting elegance, and no one is left unscathed. The most amazing thing about this film is how the characters' emotions are captured: fear and insecurity; you can see the sadness in their eyes. This film is not trying to tell us anything new about racism in our society, it is pointing out the obvious. Often times the best remedy in avocating change is to ask a question: ""What will you do?"" There have been four good movies released in 2005 so far, and this is one of them."
1,"This is Not Even a Movie, THIS IS A DISASTER","Okay, I know that the director probably had good intentions filming this picture, trying to address issues of racism and everything, but for God's sake, WELCOME TO THE 21ST CENTURY when, if I am not mistaken, the idea of racism is no longer tolerated. So this movie is not bold, or revolutionary at all. In fact, the disturbing scenes this movie is filled with just leaves me want to vomit. This movie is a total disaster, and the Oscar board must be blind to pick this as the Best Pictures winner."
1,This movie made me fall asleep!,Not a great movie just very boring. I wanted to watch this really bad because it got nominated for an Oscar but when I rented it I fell asleep after watching it for 20 minutes. Brokeback Mountain is better in my opinion. Crash was just too slow. Don't see this movie!
1,Crash is a Disappointing Film,"Crash tries in too heavy-handed a manner its attempt to interweave various plots with the themes of race relations and stereotype bias.Instead of making a profound statement, the film is a skirting, shallow view of race, actually bringing down the characters in the movie to the level of cut-outs or stereotypes themselves.Insipid and banal. Don't waste your valuable time if you like to think and not be shown."
2,Nice for Premium Cable,"""Crash"" is a simplistic, exaggerated, and manipulative piece of film making. It's no wonder that Lion's Gate immediately started casting the TV series soon as they bought the distribution rights. It's a feel good ""aren't we bad?"" movie striving for importance with mediocre performances by some of the leads including Sandra Bullock."
2,Ehh...,"Having seen ""Crash"" when it was first released, I didn't like it. It seemed contrived and obvious - hardly the stuff of life-changing films.However, after the Academy Awards, I decided to give it another shot. And again, I was not impressed.""Crash"" still comes across as a stretch - a movie so concerned with having something to say that it ultimately says nothing."
2,Terrible...,"I definitely agree with the last reviewer - this movie was horrendous. The first time I watched it I barely got through the first 30 minutes. It felt like someone's thesis on race relations in the United States. In an attempt to create the most unlikely of situations to prove that race is not as black and white as it may seem, the writer tried to create scenes that were too artificial and too distilled to be of substance. The ensemble cast was a talented bunch, but poorly used. The performances in general may be the only redeeming thing about a movie that seems like it was written by a college freshman trying to impress his film professor."
2,Lot of hype little worth,"This movie was an over acted melodramatic exercise in hollywood self stroking. plotlines were predictable, and all but one characters were lacking in humanity. By the middle of the movie I was praying for some on to nuke LA so I wouldn't have to suffer through the rest of this pretentious piece of garbage. The only reason it won oscars was because it was the only nominee accually filmed in LA, and everyone knows hollywood love to stroke itself(SEE WE STILL MAKE THE BEST)even though most of the best movies of the past several years have been made elsewhere"
2,"""Crash"" is exactly what this movie needs to do!","Sorry folx, but I thought this movie was CORN-YYYY!!!A lot of this stuff just isn't beleivable. Too many wild and unlikely coincidences. Ludacris and Lorenz Tate, after all their complaints about being stereotyped as gangbangers in a white neighborhood, go on and carjack a white couple and run over an Asian man? (Then Luda goes on to deal in the Asian slave traffic! WHAAT?)The racist cop (Matt Dillon) who molests a Black lady (Thandie Newton) in front of her husband ""coincidentally"" saves her from a gas fire!?The husband in question (Terrance Howard) ""coincidentally"" runs into one of the same cops after Ludacris tries to rob him?The Iraqui man goes out gunning after the Hispanic locksmith who he feels cheated him-knowingly with a BLANK PISTOL?I could go on and on. No need to give away the ending. But this movie, in spite of it's lofty and noble intentions, winds up being best described in two words-the first being ""BULL!"""
2,Me and Craig,"Sorry folks, but l have to agree with the reviewer Craig on this one: this film is so contrived, l had difficulty not turning it off about 3/4 of the way thru.Much of the acting was overdone, but no wonder: the movie dealt with a gloomy treatise and stock characters ..very few of whom l could identify with, much less care about. To me, it's just another film well-received by critics because it was artsy, pedantic, foreboding, glum, and with yet more sociological and psychological messages. Enough already! lf l want something educational, l'll take a college couse, thank you!"
1,"Ludacris is sexy, but this movie didn't deserve the Oscar.","I was not feeling this movie AT ALL. I didn't care about the characters or what happened to them because I was so bored with the story. I can't believe this raggedy sermon of a movie beat ""Brokeback Mountain"" at the Oscars. However, Ludacris and Larenz Tate looked PHYNE, but not even they could redeem this stinker. Thumbs down."
5,One of the years greatest movies,"This is a very touching movie. I recommend this movie to anyone because it is something we can all relate to no matter what our ethnic background is. This movie has several award winning performances and yet not one of these actors stands out above the rest. With all the big names, I wouldn't call anyone the lead star of the movie because they are all secondary to the movies powerful theme."
5,Amazing movie,"This was simply one of the best film's I have experienced in years. Elegant, and skillfully written, this character driven drama examines race relations through interconnecting lives over a period of one day in Los Angeles.It gave an honest look, and sometimes unsettling on how people deal with each other based on skin color, however there are moments of hope and triumph that balance it all out. Highly recommend seeing this movie."
2,Crash,"I had read a lot of good reviews about this movie, but as I watched it I lost interest and became very confused and found this hard to follow. I had brought this for my collection,in all honestly would give it away. It took me some time to hunt this one down and would not recomend this to anyone, even if it was free."
2,Not my favorite Sandra Bullock,"I just couldn't get into this movie. I never felt like it had a real ending, and I felt very down. If it had been developed differently, and there had been some resolution other than when the shop owner thought he shot the little girl, I might be analyzing it differently. It had some fabulous moments, don't misunderstand this commentary. And I am ever so greatful for my prime membership and I didn't have to pay for it."
1,crash me!!,The movie dragged the whole time. It had a promising plot just a very slow movie where you anticipated what was gonna happen.
2,After School Special,"Crash is an 'After School Special' with a Hollywood movie budget. There is a moral at the end of the story and you just might learn something when it is done. That is, the movie watching public is very hungry for easily digestible TV scripted pabulum. Like a very similar movie Magnolia (with the same contrived, sappy music video ending), the formula of the story is a many short vignettes of intertwined lives. Every story is perfectly crafted to exact a cheap emotional response. Corruption, Racism, Greed, all the hot button topics are touched upon to provoke you. If that was not enough, every character is an easily detected stereotype. Which is confusing when the message of the movie is people are more complex than two-dimensional automatons. With these type of 'message movies"" all the characters have an epiphany by the end for better or worse. Like an ABC 'After School Special' it doesn't get more complex than that."
3,Need a Scorepad,This movie was OK; there were just so many different story lines going that it was hard to keep them all straight. I'm glad I didn't pay to see it on the big screen.
1,Skip it.,"The movie is pretentious and overrated. The topic has been cover over and over again in movies, and much better by the way. Skip it."
3,Interesting... yes. Best picture? no way.,"This is a movie that tried really really hard. It wanted to be deep. It wanted to have meaning. It wanted to show something new, and it wanted to be controversial. Well... it almost worked. Kind of. The only problem was, this film has no soul. Yes, we can recognize the prejudice and racial tensions, but no matter how ""in your face"" this film is (or tries to be), it never really makes you care. It somehow won a best picture, which is (in my opinion at least) more of a condemnation of the rest of the films released this year than an acclamation of this one. ""Crash"" was interesting, but very contrived, and it doesn't bring anything to the table that hasn't been covered before, and better, by other films. It's one that I watched once, and have no incentive or inclination to ever sit through again."
3,Good but certainly nothing great about it.,"This was a good movie, offered a few different little plots and kept my interest. However I don't see how anyone could give this 5 stars. There's nothing great about it. The fact it won some awards shows how poor the choices were. There was one gut wrenching scene though with the guy's little girl, I won't say what though. Otherwise it was just kind of so-so. Sandra Bullock was weak and Matt Dillon played a decent cop and I don't know what Cheadle was doing. This was just a movie with some good bits and pieces but nothing great."
3,Trying too hard,"There is a great movie here somewhere. Unfortunately it fails to deliver. The story is worthy and the characters (there are about a dozen main ones) are all believable. The problem is that all these characters interlink and the basic message of the film, which is about racism, is hammered home over and over until I was fed up with being lectured to....Worse still I hated the irratating music which droned on in the background. Don't get me wrong its still a pretty good movie and there are some fine performances from various actors and actresses, but it could have been so much better."
3,Oscar winner? Overrated,"Crash is a good movie. it has some spectacular acting in Matt Dillion and Thandie Newton. A really surprising performance from Sandra Bullock as well, who knew she could do more than romantic comedies?Basically the story ask some hard questions about out attitdues and beilfes about race, the prblem is they are the sterotypical questions, and the answers they come to are too pat.It's a good movie and I reccomend seeing it, but it doesn't live up to the hype."
1,Crash and BURN!,"Over the top. Typical, showing the worse of the worse. Watching this movie one would think I should fear all the people around my complex who are of a different race! JUST RIDICULOUS THIS MOVIE."
1,The Academy will pay DEARLY for their mistake!,"I almost had a meltdown when I saw Jack Nicholson announce that ""Crash"" won for Best Picture at the Oscars. I was hurt, angry, betrayed, violated and completely floored that this poorly executed commentary on race relations would knock ""Brokeback Mountain"" from the Top Prize. Wake up, America! You're being pandered to, and you don't even know it! This movie is unrealistic, with laughably bad dialogue and a ""Magnolia""-like plot. Plus, did they really need to cast 500 people for this movie? Jeez, no wonder why host John Stewart said to the Oscar audience ""Raise your hand if you're NOT in 'Crash.'"" The Academy may be laughing now, but they will pay DEARLY for rewarding the wrong movie for Best Picture. We smart people know deep down in our hearts that ""Brokeback Mountain"" is the better film. Wait til THAT film hits DVD; sales will be through the roof."
1,A Piece of Trash,"Yes, I am one of the small but loyal people who absolutely hated Crash.Just to make sure you understand me, I hated Crash....with a vengeance.As I black(and female) young adult who has grown up in an amazingly diverse area, I was completely disgusted by Crash's depiction of race. Not only did it simplify race into the most stereotypical issues, it belittled the audience by being pretentious and self righteous.Crash isn't anything new and it's anything but special. If you enjoy movies that completely miss the point of racial differences (but thinks it hits it right on the mark) watch Crash. When you're ready to see a great movie about discrimination, go watch American History X or another movie that is worthy of its praise."
1,CRASH IS TRASH!!,"This is the type of ""sick"" movie that has never appealed to me. It is another example of the trash that Hollywood has become. My gosh, every other word in this movie is the ""F"" word. Is this what we want to see?? We get enough of this in the real world without having it thrown at us!!!! The only reason I saw this movie was because I was out in fellowship one night with friends and we went to the movies (something I hardly ever do). I cannot believe this piece of garbage won Best Picture. Its another sorry example of the state of our culture, the monstrosity is has become and where, unfortunately we are headed...to hell in a hand basket!!"
1,OSCAR TRAVESTY,This is the worst film EVER to win the Best picture Oscar. All the win shows is that Hollywood is filled with a bunch of Homophobes. CRASH is TRASH!
2,Bloated,"Oh please. An inferior Amorresperros, 21 Grams, Do the Right Thing wannabe is what we have here.The writers of this piece of garbage were obviously trying hard to be gritty and controversial by confronting racial tensions in the USA, but instead came off as unbelievably trite, glossy and overdone.The acting is overdone, the dialougue amateur, the characters exaggerated...the list goes on. How this won the most prestigious film award has me baffeled.If you are willing to look beyond all that, the film can be entertaining, but Oscar-worthy? Please..."
2,too loud,"When the background music completely overpowers the dialogue, you may as well turn it off. The background music was piercing and I needed to have the remote in hand to keep adjusting the volume. Not everyone has perfect hearing and shows with overwhelming background music are becoming the norm. A shame because otherwise I could have enjoyed Crash."
1,"Hollywood tries serious social comment, and Crashes","Not even Quentin Tarantino conspiring with Robert Altman could make this nasty, meretricious, one-note little film about racism in L.A. I could put up with the outrageous string of coincidences presented as plausible if there were some honest point being made, but the film traffics in the very stereotypes that perpetuate racism--the black carjackers, the Mexican maid, the Mideastern would-be assassin. It's also offensive in its blanket indictment--we're all racists, equally guilty--and loads the dice mercilessly to make that altogether false point. But to discuss the point of view of the film is to do it too much credit. The fine cast should all be embarrassed to have served up this swill."
1,A B C Anything But Crash,"Wow - this has to down as one, if not the worst Best Picture winners ever. To think that there were far more deserving films last year that deserved the top honors. The four other films nominated along with the non nominated Match Point, Syriana, A History of Violence, The Constant Gardner, Mysterious Skin, Walk the Line. From the opening line ""No one touches any more - that's why we crash in to each other just so we can feel something"" - god make me puke to the final sitcom like fender bender scene. If the Academy did want to award Brokeback Mountain there were plenty of other worthy films. Many of the one star reviewers said pretty much what needed to be said about this film. The heavy handiness, silly dialogue, bad acting, etc. It also felt very dated - could have had more impact if would have been released after the Rodney King incident."
2,"Like everything else in celebrityhood, this has been done before","Crash might be helpful to all the six-year-olds who might not fully grasp the myriad complexities of race and racism. For the rest of us, however, it's more than a little elementary (racism is more than skin deep, oh my!!). And like all things race in America, it must not, it cannot, receive even a teeny weeny speck of negative criticism. Anyone who does not automatically exclaim, ""EVERYONE SHOULD SEE THIS MOVIE!!"" is automatically branded a racist, when in fact this film inadvertently celebrates robot racism (""white-people-bad-black-people-bad""). It's all so exhausting.I further dump on the movie and most of its reviewers for not giving a big ol' credit to films that were obviously deeply influential: Grand Canyon and Falling Down, to name two. With more subtlety, I see a failed attempt to co-opt the art and rhythm of P.T. Anderson in this reel.Can't we just all generate some new ideas?"
4,a Good Film,"this Film works on several levels because it stays with it's theme of dealing with Racism which is not mentioned near enough in modern day Film,Tv,etc....I Applaud the Film-makers behind this Project for speaking on a subject that should be talked about daily.this film tackles Race-Relations&Impacts so many various lives.a good film that will make you thnk.the Cast complimented One another really well in this film."
4,Great cast,"Great movie and a great cast. short stories beautifuly told. Matt Dillon is maginficient, Sondra Bullock is terrific as well."
3,its ok.,Not much of a plot. Somewhat true. Nothing kept me on the edge of my seat.Nothing suprising. It's ok. Would only recommend as a last resort
1,Not worth the time,Typical Hollywood portrayel of racism. The movie is slow and the white people are the bad guys for the most part. This movie is definitely not worth the time.
5,excellent,"So many real life story lines that tie together. Excellent acting throughout. Makes you think, you will not be disappointed."
2,"makes ""Do the Right Thing"" look understated","Unrealistic story and unrealistic dialogue can work in a more stylized or surreal piece. The suspension of reality still works. But Crash, a seemingly more naturalistic film about the malignant effects of racism, such elements become distracting, and ultimately sabotage the effort. Haggis is high-minded here, but his lack of subtlety is self-defeating, making the film predictable in parts and preposterous in others. Good performances by Matt Dillon and Terrence Howard are wasted in this film that wants us to believe that, in a city of 4.5 million, such unrelated stories would happen to intersect so seemlessly. Only in a Seinfeld episode."
2,Disappointed by the quality of the picture,"The movie itself is great proven by Oscar awards. However the picture quality of this blu-ray disc is not better than the DVD. While I was watching it, I had to check the case to make sure I was watching a blu-ray disc and even pulled out a disc from the player to see the blu-ray logo on the disc. If it is a blu-ray, it should have superior picture quality than the dvd and this Crash blu-ray apparently does not. I watched this movie on a 120 inch screen, so I could easily point out the quality problem. Lionsgate needs to do a better job next time."
5,Glad I didn't see this at the theater...,"If I had seen Crash with a theater of people, I would have made a complete fool of myself. I screamed - loud. I've seen some reviews: ""cliches,"" ""saw it all coming,"" but what I saw were people in situations that are often too real because of misunderstandings and perceptions based on sterotypes, the media and what we experience in our lives every day. By the end of the movie, most characters seemed to have learned something about themselves. Maybe viewers will learn something as well. That, above all things, is what I got from this film."
1,"""Brokeback Mountain"" is obviously the better film.","What self-respecting critic of classic cinema would DARE give this higher than one star? ""Crash"" was written and directed by liberals who want to look ""progressive"" and ""hip."" Sorry, not convinced. If you really believe this was the best film of 2006 then you need to see a therapist."
2,I Was Bored,"I know that this movie has done very well critically and commerically, but I found it both preachy and boring.Racism is ugly and despicable, no question about it. But the last thing I want is some ""holier than thou"" Hollywood filmmaker trying to hit me over the head with his politically correct message.On the plus side, the film is shot well, with attention to atmosphere, etc. But please, if you're looking to be entertained or even challenged, look elsewhere."
5,Best film of the year...,"And the academy award winner for best film is...not Brockback mountain. I was afraid, really. I'm not against homosexual propaganda, but enough is enough. It's really good to see a movie that simply tells stories about..life. the actors are awesome. Great part for Matt Dillon and Don cheadle as usual. My favourite scenes are when matt Dillon saves the lady on the freeway accident (no respect for her 30min before this scene) and when the man from the drugstore lose his mind and wants to kill a poor guy and shot his daughter instead. but i talk to much. Just see this movie. two thumbs up."
2,"Ugh, ok, whatever","The movie was interesting to watch, but I think only a small portion of the population is this racist, I mean, seriously. It was also annoying to see how a person's attitude changed unbelievably from the beginning of the movie to the end. There wasn't any real conclusion either. We just get a glimpse into the lives of these people and that's it, no ending."
3,Average,"Funny thing about this little movie is that when watching it I thought it played like a pilot of a TV series on cable. Well guess what's in the works?Anyway the first time I saw this in theatres I was impressed. But the next time it didn't hold up as well. Things ended a little too neat. The story elements were a little too convenient. The characters were too self-aware in the way they talked and interacted. I still thought the editing was good. If only some of the dialogue could be edited it would have been better. There was a little too much ""tell"" and not enough ""show"" about the underlining consequences of prejudice (which is internal) and discrimination (which is external). The performances varied from individual with the standouts being Thadie Newton, Terrence Howard, and Matt Dillon. Some may find certain scenes moving and others may see it as manipulative. Due to the divisiveness of opinions I would recommend renting before you buy if you want to see it."
2,Well-made but annoying to watch,"This is a very well-made film but what of it? Anyone who has enough free time from the real world of stressful race relations to watch a movie that portrays those same race relations jacked up with plenty of manipulative, adrenaline pumped-up histrionics is welcome to this movie. This was done before (more hysterically) with ""Do The Right Thing"" and in the book (more intelligently and cynically), ""Bonfire of Vanities."" Rather than change my views on race, this only confirmed to me that multi-culturalism does not work and that we either are going to have to move toward mono-culturalism or we will quietly move into geographical/economic isolation from each other. This movie showed that it is nothing but a fantasy that hundreds of cultures can co-exist without misunderstandings and suspicions boiling up into violence. Ironically, the movie argues against itself as it shows that the problem is so widespread and profound that tensions are absolutely inevitable."
3,Too Preachy,"The story line was interesting enough that we didn't shut it off BUT it was so preachy that at the end we regretted watching it. If you want to be ""schooled"" then this is your movie but, personally I watch movies to escape, have fun and forget the day. You get the for about 45 minutes but, then the lessons begin and it gets annoying. To be honest it was a little predictable too but, whatever.... I don't always mind if I already know the ending if it's done well."
1,"Way over the top, totally unrealistic and unbelievable","this movie is so unbelievable and unrealistic. The writers know absolutely nothing about racism and discrimination in the real world. How in the world did this move even get nominated for best pic by the academy, let alone win?? Oh yeah, the academy voters don't watch the movies. jeez, this movie is pathetic."
2,Nothing monumental but entertaining.,"With all the buzz I had heard about this movie, coupled with the fairly impressive cast, I must admit that I wasn't overly impressed. The movie was entertaining but I certainly didn't feel that it warrants the credit being attributed to it. I certainly didn't need to see this movie to encompass all it entails. Everyone is racist. Racism, contrary to popular belief, is not a white vs. minorities issue. Further into the movie, I thought the connection that Matt Dillon's character had with the black woman was cheezy and way too predictable. What also didn't impress me is how, in the end, it reverts back to the white man being the ""bad guy"" (boy you don't see that in Hollywood do you???). Worthy of a Friday night rental but it's not likely one I'd wish to own."
4,A Relevant and Uncomfortable Theme,"It's easier to hide our heads in the sand than to watch this movie. The main theme deals with people's prejudices and racism which isn't the simplest of subjects. It's easier to just pass this film by than to challenge ourselves to confront our prejudices.The main characters in the film end up with intertwined lives in the course of a day. People they may not have met in the normal routine of things, but people they'll need when chaos ensues.If not the best movie, it at least got me to thinking about something still prevalent in this day and age. Racism and prejudice are alive and well, we're just much better at being subtle about it."
5,Interesting Film,"When I saw this movie in theatres, I was truly blown away by the heavy subject matter that the film deals with. It tells the story of how everyone's lives intertwine and that we all have certain biases, whether we choose to acknowledge them or not. After you see it, you want to talk about it, it prompts you to stop and think about your own personal life. Amazing."
4,You'll not get away with discrimination,"This movie is great. I have never seen any movie with discrimination before. After i finished watch this movie, i was surprise who much it feel to be discriminated by other and they didn't know who you are. In this movie, it showed all kind of discrimination such color skin, nationalities, and stereotype. In the real world, discrimination would never change. I hope that any one who watched this movie could think about discrimination and take it more seriously. I will be very disappointed if i did not watch this movie."
2,Racial tension overload!,"why why why why why why why why why why whyHello, I love multi-culturalism, and this is not it. not Oscar caliber. So disappointing!Watch Hustle & Flow instead.And, yes, I do think we miss being touched. But, no, we don't crash into each other because of it."
1,Good Movie Bad Bluray,"This is a warning, dont buy this movie not for the plot itself, just for the bad bad quality of the bluray picture, I cant believe they even bother to clean the grains in the movie, is the worst bluray movie i've ever seen, nevertheless this is one of my favorite movies of all the time"
2,"Not the best, but not the worst, either","I would recommend renting this movie before you buy it. It does have a great cast, however."
5,a movie long overdue,"I won't take up too much of your time with a long synopsis of this movie, but I will tell you that it was incredible. I strongly disagree with anyone who believed the racism in this movie was overexaggerated, because I assure you it wasn't. It was an up-to-date, theatrical representation of the current racial climate in this country. Being an African-American, I appreciated the realism dealing with not only racism against blacks, but against latinos and middle easterners as well. I could also appreciate the fact that the movie showed the human side to each every one of its characters, including the white ones. It was by no means a one sided picture. In the end, I strongly recommend this movie to anyone living in America who gives a damn about whats really going on in the society they live in."
4,Makes You Think,"I almost walked out of Crash at the beginning. But I stayed, and in the end I really appreciated the movie.This is not mindless entertainment. It is meant to make you think about prejudice and how we treat other people. It does this in a very serious and depressing manner.Crash will give you something to think about."
