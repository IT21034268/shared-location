2,just go on you tube,I gave this as a gift to a daddy to be and it did not meet expectations. The concept is cute but the novelty of it is not worth the money. You might as well be reading a book. Save yourself the money and just go on you tube or google how to videos on baby care and you'll be set.
2,Good for beginners,Bought this racket based on the description. It doesn't even come close. Good for beginning players. Hard to loop the ball as the rubber doesn't have much grip.
2,tennis paddle,"Item arrived on time and it is of a good quality. I am fully satisfied with this paddle, it has a nice grip"
1,bad seller,seller kept me waiting for 10 days and then says the item is no longer available. he might have sold it at a higher price elsewhere.
1,Not worth the price,"I am not a table tennis expert player but still I must tell this item is not really worth the price. My friend bought a racquet for less than $7, which is better than this product.Do more research and I am sure you can get a better one for the same price."
3,Didn't work right for me,"This card looked great, however, it didn't work right on my Palm Tungsten T. It was slow, and the speech didn't come out right. I'm sure if you had a newer Palm it would work great."
1,Doesn't work on my T|X,Palm Speaking Language Translator (P10936U)I bought this product in december 2007 and till today didn'n succeed in making it to work on my Palm Tungsten T|X
2,"Slow, Terrible Quality","This is a very poor product. The audio sounds like the early 1980s computer/robot voice sound (you sure aren't going to learn how to pronounce a foreign word with this product!). I've found no volume control (it's very loud when you use ear buds). The program itself takes over ten seconds to load. Then there are further delays as it loads the data as you use it. There is plenty of screen space, they could have displayed the word in all five languages easily instead of having to switch languages and find the word again."
1,Worse than useless.,I bought this for my Palm Lifedrive specifically for a trip to France. I wanted to be able to hear word pronunciations. The sound quality was the worst I ever heard from a computer generated voice system and completely unintelligible. Then to make matters worse PC Universe charged me a restocking fee for an item that did not work. Plus they did not process my refund until I called to inquire about it. This was my first and last purchase from PC Universe.
5,This is a hit,"I have a small Jack Russel, so this is hilarious to watch him carry it around. So far he hasn't torn out the squeakers, but it's been less that a week. Seems to be a favorite."
1,Not worth your money .....,I bought two of these for my great pyrenees/boarder collie puppy. He had the stuffing out of the first one in about an hour. The second one followed rather quickly. He does love carrying them around .... so if you don't mind stuffing being trailed all over the house ..............
4,old times,Great authors. I read this book to my kids and now reading to my grandkids. All my kids were excited that these will be back in the house.
2,Beware,"Beware. If purchasing 'The Berenstain Bears and The Spooky Old Tree *with audio cassette' from owlsbooks, they are NOT selling the book advertised. They are actually selling a later reprint that does NOT have the audio cassette. Save some money and just by the modern copy for about half the price."
5,I read this one over and over to my students,"This is a wonderful book which has all the elements children love... suspense, spooky things, independence and at the end, delivery to safety. How my students love to read or be read this book! I use this with children who have speech and language delays. It subliminally, in the form of delightful spookiness, teaches prediction, simple sentence forms, and vocabulary. We make comparisons between monsters and the spooky old tree, which looks a lot like a monster, with beady ""eyes"", hands to grab little children and an opening that looks like a mouth.When my own children were little, they delighted in this book and played a game where they tried to climb over their own Great Sleeping Bear (Daddy), who would roar and chase them. Shrieks of laughter!!"
5,A Classic,"This is one of our favorite books. My kids want it read over and over. They also enjoy ""shivering"" along with the bears throughout the story. This is definitely a classic that we never tire of."
4,"Funny, just a bit scary","This is one of the earlier Berenstain Bear books, and it shows. The bears are less stylized and cutesy than the bears in the newer books, and the story is halfway between an early reader and the newer, longer read-alouds they do now.It's a cute little story about three cubs going out with a light, a stick, and a rope to explore. Of course, they lose all three items and run screaming home to mom - and with good reason, that spooky old tree is *really* spooky.There are only a few words per page, with a basic vocabulary, so it's great for early readers."
4,The Berenstain Bears andf the Spooky Old Tree,Great book for young readers. Easy to read and understand.
5,Great book for preschoolers,"This book was a Halloween gift for my 3 year old grandson. Within a day (we read it many times) he was able to ""read it"" to me. He took it to school and the teacher let him ""read it"" to his class for sharing! This was a hit, simple and entertaining."
3,a dry introduction to boogie woogie,"Like the 'real' Hanon, this book is little more than a very inclusive array of exercises. I suppose that religious attention to doing them would improve one's skills, but it is a very 'dry' way to approach boogie woogie piano. One would be better served to obtain (or 'sound out') the music for some tunes and learn by actually playing the music itself. By its very nature, boogie woogie piano is built on repetition and patterns...the tunes themselves can serve as both technique-builders and repertiore."
2,CWB???,"This Album Just Shows That If You Got MONEY Haystak Will Be Your Buddy!He'll Make A Album With Anyone & When It Don't Sell It Will Be Out Of Print!Dutch Thought He Could Get Haystak On A Whole Album & Make A Million But It Takes Hard Work Not Features!The Best Part About This Cd Is Stak & Lex,Dutch The So Called Great Is The Worst Part Of The CD!Not To Mention He's Trying To Jump On That CWB Band Wagon That Is starting To Become Something like a ICP Juggalo Show!Add It To Your Haystak Collection If You Must But Don't Spend Ya Hard Earned Money!"
1,Such a disappointment,"I had high hopes for this book. However the title is about the smartest thing about this piece. Perhaps I'm not the part of the target audience for this book. Unfortunately I felt Zevin was pushing too hard to be funny and it just didn't work out. I'm sure he's a funny guy in real life, but as far as I'm concerned, his writing needs a lot of work."
5,Great book!,"As a twenty-something, I read this book and found hilarious some of the things he refers to that were totally cool to do (dumpster dive for furniture) that wouldn't pass at a later age. Or also not being able to stay out late and party, or things that sounded totally boring are actually enjoyable at a later age. Very funny!"
2,Not that funny,"I was hoping to find my next David Sedaris, but alas I did not. Reading these stories, the only thing that kept coming to mind was ""this guy is trying way too hard to be funny."" I myself am a late twenty something, struggling with many of the same things Zevin MENTIONS - but there is never a climax, never a conclusion, just rambling and unfunny rambling at that. He often speaks of not being able to fix anything around the house, in fact there is an entire chapter on that, however it has NOTHING to do with growing up, no realizations, and NO FUNNIES! I finished the book but simply felt annoyed for doing so."
2,Didn't like,"This is the first book I have ever stopped reading in the middle of. It didn't keep me interested, and wasn't as funny as I thought it was going to be. Maybe it's just not a book for females."
5,I too suffer from the Peter Pan complex....,Dan Zevin is articulate and incredibly insightful in addressing the awful realization that we all must grow up one day....or at least pretend until science finds a cure for this terrible ailment. He has a natural flair for storytelling and finding the humor in the seemingly mundane chores of every day life. This book fabulous! It's a quick read and leaves you wanting more! Buy it for yourself! Buy it for all your uncool friends!
5,Funny!,"Have a great laugh with Dan Z. These stories are extremely funny. His life has been much ""cooler"" than mine has, for sure! I read this when it was released several years ago and recently skimmed it again. Light and easy read to get done over a weekend."
2,"slow for the money, expensive","We've used this at our small business office since November.I don't think I've ever hated a printer as much.Although it is pricey, it is way slow. Maybe 40s per page and 10-20s to turn over the page to print the other side. You read that right - if we get more than a page a minute out we are doing good. The only way to get acceptable speed is to go to draft mode and turn off double sided printing. Not what you expect in a $300 printer.The other thing we hate about it is that the cartridges are now coded so that remanufactured cartridges won't work. (It works by expiration date - a cartridge old enough to have been used up and re-filled gets rejected by the printer. I wonder what happens if you are unfortunate enough to buy a new cartridge that has been stockpiled somewhere.)Overall, I have to believe there are better choices. Of our three printers, I only use this one when I really want double-sided."
2,"I'm a Beginner, But Not Stupid! This is Not As Simple as Promised","Iv'e been playing with this for a couple of hours at a time, so I don't throw my computer housing it out the window. This version should be much simpler for people who want to record & easily playback on mp3's or windows media player. Proper file extensions to play outside of the cakewalk program itself seem to be the holy grail in achievment if I had nothing better to do with time. Simple, easy pfffft I think not."
2,Is that a lie?,"Cakewalk""s advertisement saying something like..."" no experience needed to operate this software..."" is, in my mind, mis-leading at least and a down right lie at most. I've had it now for about three weeks, work on it most days, usually in the middle of the night so I can really concentrate on it, and still cant get anything out of it.All I wanted was some backing tracks for my acoustic guitar work...blues, pop, country....so far nothing and I am thinking about giving up.I can operate a computer but this skill has nothing to do with this most confusing piece of junk I have ever seen.BEWARE...unless your a recording engineer you probably will be disapointed."
3,Good beginning tool,"I needed to buy this product for an online class I was taking, and finished every project that I had to do using this software. I know this is not the top of the line software, but it was great learning some basic tutorials and concepts. When I went to Best Buy to ask for it, the guys there looked at me twice, basically wondering why I was purchasing such an inferior product.For the price, however, compared to some of the other music software they had, I did not mind. The interface can be improved A LOT, as it was difficult in the beginning to figure out what I was doing. The tutorials are ok, but I wish there were video tutorials for some of the lessons and more of the terms were defined for those who are not experts already"
2,Outdated,"Black Moses was first published nearly 50 years ago. It was based on a masters thesis and for years was the only book available on Marcus Garvey. Since the 1970s several new books on Garvey have appeared, most notably Race First by Tony Martin. These more recent books are much better researched and incorporate a lot of new sources that Cronon was unaware of or did not have access to. These include Garvey's newspaper, the Negro World and various governmenrt records in the US National Archives. It simply is no longer possible to get a really accurate view of Marcus Garvey from Cronon's now woefully out of date work. It served its purpose but should now give way to better books."
3,not that much powerful,"I guess I was looking for something more powerful. Get the job done to clean small objects (like dishes, etc) but does not get the job done really well if you need to scrub title, bacth tub, etc"
3,PKS1150 B&D,"It is a simple design, functional, effective and quite useful.I would have preferred their old B&D; batteries to the new ones they require."
3,"starts out like your average usa movie, but by the end, it's a real movie.","I gotta be honest, I should have given this a 4/5, but it a 3.5, and I had to go with the 3. Still, this movie is not a martial arts movie, except in the realism sense. It's sort of like the ufc style, but definitely still looks like movie martial arts. Better fight scenes than sy rocky, but won't live up to any of the good chinese martial artists out there.Still a movie that is worth watching at least a few times."
2,Missing disc,I purchased this DVD/CD set from Amazon as a gift for my partner for Christmas. When it arrived we found it was missing a disc from the set. How do i go about getting a replacement copy?
4,An eye opener,"The lowly state and status of women in India was shocking to encounter in this novel, evoking sympathy, compassion, anger even. This is a complex, fascinating novel, which packs many punches."
4,The Ashram,"The Ashram was written by my oncologist, who grew up in India. This novel is beautifully written, with lovely descriptions of the countryside and mountains. The story is a mix of romance, adventure, Eastern spirituality, and mystery woven into a fascinating whole. The somewhat stilted language adds to the flavor of India. Towards the conclusion, it was so inspirational and emotional that I was moved to tears."
1,Horribly put together and certainly not durable for a preschooler,"Assembly of this toy is incredibly difficult as the ramp pieces are hard to connect. My son usually had the thing in a dozen pieces after 5 minutes of play. Attaching the ramp without instructions was another puzzling exercise in futility.This toy is also not easy to pack up back in its carrying case. Lots of cheap, hard-to-assemble pieces and a tendency to fall apart make this toy a stinker."
4,Better,"This Thomas Take-Along toy was a much better purchase than the last couple of toys from the same company. This toy seems to be better built, better thought out and a LOT more durable. Recently I was losing faith in the Learning Curve toys, but this is more sturdy like earlier efforts. I hope the company realized they were going too cheapy on last couple of Thomas toys. This one I would recommend."
3,clut Classic,"This film does take some time and thought..It was done in an aera when scary movies were not as intense as the Exocist are today..But its good entainment and at the right price,with great on time delivery."
3,what happened to student nurses?,"some boxed set. it excludes the first film that started the series, student nurses. quality is WAY better last student teachers/student nurses boxed set though. guess us corman fans have to take what we can get. the price was right at least"
1,Murky water,"Jack Fish starts off with a good premise, but it doesn't pan out. There's lots of promising characters and concepts, but they never come together.The novel falls short because Jack is a passive character. He's nowhere near as compelling or funny as the weird characters he meets along the way.Some of the weirdness is a lot of fun, while other elements seem forced.At its worst, the book reads like the first draft of an author's first novel. What's supposed to be a ""love letter"" to New York feels empty (It's 2005 and the author has characters using tokens instead of Metrocards. Small detail, but it's an example of the little things that don't work in this flawed novel.)"
4,Queen into cop,not beleiveable plot.stars from dance hall queen were bad guys in one movie than they become good guys in third world cop.
1,THIRD WORLD BLAXPLOITATION HERE!,"This movie was a waste of celluloid and my time!! The actors need shooling, and the cop needs lessons in walking in heels if he's gonna portray a prostitute. Who did the makeup here, Marilyn Manson? The drug shoot-outs practically had me rollin' in the aisles, and if you look closely you see bullet explosions from the victim's chests! A third world blaxploitation masterpiece!! Buy the CD and light-up a blunt instead!"
3,Its aiight!,"Third World cop seeks to extend the legacy of the 1970's cult classic ""The Harder They Come"". Fast forward to the late 1990's Kingston and the bad guys and heroes may look the same but the game remains the same. We're still looking to get over and this film certainly tries."
4,a must for dancehall fans,"if you love dancehall this movie has a bit of a surprise for you. ninjaman, elephantman, nitty kutchie, boom dandemite, harry toddler, and cutty ranks all have roles in this movie; which is a cop versus gun dealer type flick. the dvd is full screen and shot in cheap video format, but it still shines despite these flaws. the soundtrack is very good despite containing no tracks from the aforementioned artists. i wonder if this is what ninjaman has been doing lately, because he does have quite a substantial role in this flick, and doesn't do bad at all at the acting thing...."
2,Dreadful adaptation of a good detective story,"To P.D. James devotees: skip this one. Marsden makes an adequate Dalgleish but this awful plot adaptation is an insult to P. D. James and should have left him clueless.The setting has been changed from an upscale London psychiatric clinic to an isolated island sanitorium and the cast of suspects focuses more on the inmates than on the interesting idiosycrasies of the professional staff.I was disappointed with the first Dalgleish adaptation, Cover Her Face, and this one is far, far worse. Only the efforts of the cast gives it my second star."
4,SoLA is not SoLO Scriptura!,"Keith Mathison has written, perhaps, the best book thus far on Sola Scriptura. The best parts are his conceptual framework that isolates the simplistic SoLO Scriptura embarassingly common in much of Evangelicalism -- from far more credible and histoic Sola Scripture. Secondly, Mathison at least partly deals with historic Traditions' place especially the Roman Catholic view. Too bad there was not more contrasting interaction with Orthodoxy's view of the content/substance and place of Holy Tradition. For that, go to Robert Aritaki's Orthodoxy-Reformed Bridge blog for some excellent (mostly) discussion here: [...] Hopefully, Mr. Mathison will update the book in a few years to make it a five star! Nevertheless, very good book...especially with Aritaki's Part #1 of #4 reviewed here: [...]"
5,This system works well,"I bought this, because like everyone else here, so that I can have good ice and drinking water dispensed from my fridge. It works great, but it is true that the unit is noisy. I am currently working on a solution for this, and if I find one, I will post a video review on here. I still think this unit is worth the money, despite the noise."
1,zero stars,"A few people mentioned that the recipes are hard to follow and the ingredients cost $$$. I did end up spending a couple hundred dollars to buy some of those carrier and essential oils, and herbs. Guess what.. They don't work. I mean.. how can you mix 16 oz of water with 1/2 teaspoon of beeswax and get creamy texture in the end? You dont! (ask me how i know). Forget about all the essential oils you put in there and have to throw away the whole mixture. None of those recipes i tried produced any desirable effect. What a waste of money! I do believe in natural beauty products, but it seems the author never actually tried her own recipes."
2,Interesting but...,"Kind of got the idea of what to do, but found the recipes somewhat hard to follow. Find some of the information confusing as if there's too much of it. The basics of the book is good but it could have been presented in a more simplistic manner."
5,one of the best of natural cosmetics,"The recipes in this book reflect the author's obviously considerable knowledge in herbalism, cosmetic and natural product chemistry and aromatherapy. All the recipes I've tried unerringly result in fabulous, professional-looking products that do what they say they will do. I am also very grateful for the generosity of the herbalists who shared their treasured recipes and health tips in this book. It's good to know that there are so many giving people out there. Even though I already know a fair amount about herbs (for a sort of advanced amateur, that is), I learned quite a bit from reading Ms. Falconi's little herbal at the end of the book (she focuses on the cosmetic applications of herbs) and the resource list is invaluable! I appreciate her efforts and the efforts of all the contributors. This is an important book in my library (and kitchen!)"
5,Packed with wonderful formulas!,"I purchased this book about a month ago and still flip through its pages very often. What I love about it is that it has a lot of recipes/formulas for every skin and hair type, including mature and baby skin. The basic ingredients are quite easy to find if you have access to a good herb store, or can be ordered through Internet-based herb stores. I have tried many formulas, including her version of herb and clay scrubs, masks and hair vinegars. Nothing has disappointed me so far, this book is a goldmine for anyone interested in making and using fresh, natural products! Go ahead and have fun!"
5,Recipes Galore,"This book is overflowing with recipes and choices. And unlike other natural cosmetics books that give recipes by type, ie. creams, scrubs, ect.., this book lists recipes according to body sections--The Joy of Facial Care; Lip, Mouth and Tooth Care; Beautiful Hair/Healthy Scalp, ect.. whcih I find extremely useful when looking to find a formula for a certain body part.Also, this book has chapters entitled ""Especially for Men"" and ""Especially for Teens"" two topics that are rarely addressed in other cosmetics books. All-in-all, I believe that ""Earthly Bodies"" is a well written, I got my moneys worth type of book."
4,"limited and repetitive, but still a lovely book","In general this book is lovely to look at and read. It promotes a spirit of healthy beauty (of course) and wholeness, which is relaxing to read. There are little drawings of plants scattered throughout and the book is generally well-organized. However, I found the recipes for oily skin fairly limited, especially having made my own concoctions before. For instance, there is no mention (that I've found) of using diluted glycerin as a moisturizer on oily skin, and one recipe even calls for beeswax -- hello, pimples! Another easy recipe that was neglected is to dissolve aspirin in 70% isopropyl alcohol to dot on blemishes (maybe not ""herbal based"" enough for this book, but it's cheap & effective). There is some repetition in this book where recipes are listed in multiple sections -- that's not necessarily bad, except I already found them limited. Recommended for beginners and those with sensitive, dry skin looking for natural products."
5,This book has a lot of recipes,I bought this book based on the reviews that I read before buying it. The reviews are true. There are many recipes in this book and there is so much information in the book. Well worth what I paid for it.
4,Rereading the stories of the Old Testament has never been show much fun!,"Ronald Hendel has done a great service to general readership of modern biblical academics. This book is very readable, and provides numerous insights into new ways of reading the Old Testament academically. What role does ones memory play in telling, writing, and transmitting the stories told in the Bible? Hendel does a tremendous job of incorporating modern ideas of memory into the transmission of the biblical accounts. To the orthodox believer this book will come across as heretical, to the über radical this book will not go far enough in negating a literalist interpretation, and to the middle of the road believer it will be very interesting read. That's where I find myself. What a wonderful book. Well-bound, good paper quality, a worthy buy, and a worthier read. Highly recommended."
3,Nothing like the picture,"in the picture, it looks as though it has a durable finish, however it is only painted black. Not textured like the picture shows. also the shackle is not red on the one end. i've had it for a few months, and it works great, be sure to buy a good lock if you plan on keeping it on all the time, these things tend to ""walk off"" quite often if they aren't."
1,Made in China,"I'm picky when it comes to spending my money and so I don't buy products made in China if I can help it. Not when there is an American made option.For the price of this item, you can get an American made Warn receiver shackle.If being made in China doesn't matter to you then you can still save money by buying this very same Chinese made receiver shackle under another brand name."
5,Must-read for parents and teachers of SI dysfunctional kids,"If you are a parent or a teacher of a child with bewildering or inconsistant behavior problems, this book explains comprehensively and clearly the ofen conflicting symptoms of children with SI dysfunction. Most exciting is the hope that children can now be diagnosed at an early age so they can begin OT therapy when it has a chance to be its most effective. Also exciting is the knowledge that there are many simple things that parents and teachers can do at home and in the classroom to improve the functioning of SI kids. I have reccomended this book to dozens of parents who have come back to buy copies for their child's teacher. The book contains an excellent resources guide, too! P.S. Carol Kranowitz does a fabulous job presenting about SI dysfunction at professional workshops. See her if you have the chance."
3,Was there important content cut out of it?,"I was very disappointed with the content of this video, after being so positively impacted by the same book. I don't think that I would have been able to grasp the occupational therapy concepts presented in the video without having first read the book. Hoping for a summary of the book to share with collegues and other parents, I am hesitant to pass this video along because the content is sketchy and does not flow nearly as well as the book. It felt like some of the author's presentation was cut out. Invest in the book first."
5,You've tried it all to no avail- now read this !,"I have a child whom no label seems to fit. He's not quite this, seems a lot like that, but none of the extensive testing had given us any answers. ""He can do it if he wants to, he just won't."" That was the diagnosis of school, therapists, etc- the educational and medical community was certain my child was just not motivated. Trouble was, I KNEW how much he wanted to succeed- how badly he wanted to fit in and get along. Then I read 'The Out of Sync Child"". It was him ! This book carries real life examples and real life solutions. You may not be at your wit's end - but don't wait until you are. It's not just for professionals, it's written for parents as well- and I wish I'd read it years ago."
1,"I'm Dysfunctional, You're Disfunctional","I'm sure that there are children with such extreme examples of this ""disorder"" that education, therapy, etc. are terrifically valuable things.But a reading of this book suggests that instead of treating disorders, the authors have simply helped invent a new one. Does your kids love water? He's got SID! Does he hate water? Then he's got SID! Other indications that your child may be suffering: ""He may feel seesick in cars or elevators...he may crave fast and spinning movement, such as swinging, rocking, twirling and riding merry-go-rounds...he may enjoy getting into upside-down positions and be a daredevil...he may be anxious when tipped off balance...""I could go on. But my point is that EVERY TODDLER IN THE WORLD would exhibit enough symptoms to be diagnosed with SID in a heartbeat. This approach so invalidates the ""disorder"" that the kids out there who are truly suffering could become marginalized by what seems like over-eager pop psychology."
1,Scam,"This book may be helpful to some parents but I found it to be very contradicting. Why do pediatric nuerologists and some pshyciatrists not buy into the theory of sensory integration dysfunction. I took my son to occupational therapy and it was the worst thing I've ever done (and the place we took him was supposed to be the ""very best"" in the field). Reading this book made me feel as though it was not ok for my child to have any differences. I truly believe it's just an excuse to use children as guinea pigs and give parents a placebo effect of therapy."
3,Not for parents of pre-school children-Good for older,"While the book was informative, it did not relate to pre-school children. Parents who are fortunate to have their children diagnosed early will have to get information elsewhere. Most of the children in the book where over five years old. Not much use for younger children. If your child is having problems in school, this book may be of help to you."
4,A great starting point to learn more about sensory issues,This book is an excellent place to start if you think your child's challenging behavior results from more than just a difficult temperament. It will help you isolate aspects of your child's behavior that might indicate that there is an underlying sensory dysfunction. Then you can use that information to get help from a qualified practitioner.
1,No scientific basis,"Although parts of this book were, at times, helpful I found that there were contradictions (ie/ too hyper vs not hyper enough = SID, kids who didn't like to swing or who really liked to swing were both considered to have SID). People should be cautioned that there is NO scientific basis for brushing, joint compressions, swinging etc in terms of helping children with these reported issues. Children often get multiple therapies concurrently so to say this is the magic one would be presumptuous to say the least. It is concerning when all of the problems a child has is simplified into a diagnosis that only OTs seem to give out. We tried it with our child and it did not make any difference at all."
5,The Out of Sinc Child,This is the best book. I was writing a book about my son who has SI Dysfunction. He is 23 years old now. I was in Barnes and Noble looking for another book when I found this. I was blown away. I never knew there was a book like this. I could have really used this book when Marcus was little. It is so wonderful. I opened it and started reading about my son. My book is called What's Wrong With My Child? Struggling With Sensory Integration Dysfunction. It is only a mother's story of how my child coped with this thing. It is not meant to be a book like Carol Stock Kranowitz's. Her book is wonderful. Anyone who has any questions about their child who has SI Dysfunction. This book is it. Shelly R. Wilson
5,Disney needs to see these stories....,"With all the hoopla about the Star Wars buyout by Disney and the impending films, it would be easy to refer to the Thrawn trilogy for story ideas. But Star Wars tales gives a collection of stories ranging across the spectrum and--the visuals are stunning. ""Extinction"" would have translated beautifully to a live-action sequence. I think the writers need to look at the visual mediums to see what imaginations are out there. If nothing else, we might avoid another Jar-Jar."
2,Only one good story for the most part,"I was disappointed with this graphic novel. There was only really one good story, I thought and one comical one. The rest were just weird and made me think they were outside the Star Wars universe (though one can clearly see they used creatures familiar to that universe). But the whole feeling to the majority of the stories were so outside my field of Star Wars enjoyment. I'm glad I was able to get this used for a decent price because I would have been upset if I paid full price for it."
3,enjoyable read with my son,"At 224 this is a large comic. Since Dark horse has had trouble producing comics with good binding I was concerned about this offering. The one I have is OK, but these were made in china, where the binding problems exist. The older ones made in Canada were OK.It was fun to read some of these with my son. For most people I think they will consider these to be 2 to 3 stars in quality, I'll round up to 3 since my son enjoyed them."
1,This is the worst book I've ever read,"This book is the worst book that I've ever read on computer programming. Although I appreciate the concepts presented in the book, when you try to read the examples, you will end up in an infinite loop rereading the text because the book is very wordy and the algorithms aren't explained in simple plain English.The diagrams are misplaced.

3,Is this really Titanium??,A nice watch! Time will tell how good this is :-) This watch is about twice as heavy as my other Seiko Titanium watch with the same mechanism. Check it out in a store before buying. I suspect that the watch case is not Titanium.
3,Color not nearly as blue as picture,"This watch is a beautiful watch, and my second Kinetic from Sieko. However, it will be mistaken by many as a black face in any light. I have looked at it discriminately in sunlight, with an Ott-Lite, fluorescent, and standard home lighting. There is a deep blue cast in the perfectly right combination of light and viewing angle. But most times it will be mistaken as a black face since no one will look closely enough."
4,Beautiful watch,The only thing is this watch doesn't do right is keep the date it seems. This is a beautiful watch! My husband absolutely loved that he never had to change the battery in it. He was extremely happy with the gift!
5,I knew...,"First grade. I'll keep his name private; let's call him ""Keith"". All the girls were playing inside, all the boys went outside. It was cold, it was wet, it was miserable. I so totally wanted to be outside, because Keith was outside. I had absolutely no clue what the other boys were doing, building a fort, playing soldier, lobbing pine cone grenades at each other, didn't make any sense at all to me, but it didn't matter, because Keith was there. Even then, at that extemely young age, I knew that I ""wanted"" him, knew that he wouldn't understand, knew that the other boys wouldn't understand, knew that I had to keep it to myself. I let myself get ""killed"" with a pine cone grenade, just so I could lie there, lifeless, watching Keith lead his forces to victory. Keith won the battle... and my heart. I knew. I was gay."
3,A little something,"Not entirely what I expected, but I thought that it was a good book. Great stories about people's knowing. The short tales that the people gave were welcoming and allowed us, the reader, into their life for a split second."
4,a bit old,"maybe its because i am a early twentie something kind of guy, but i thought that most of the articles and quotes in here were a bit old a lot of the things were over my head, refering to childhood in the 60 and 70's or earlier i think that that is great and needs to be out there but there should be a sequal of more recent events if you are in the age group that grew up during that tiem you will love it. the images were great"
2,Interesting coffee table book,"This was a great book filled with small quotes and short reality checks from various personalities. I liked it, but I thought it would be more of a compilation of stories and experiences. So, I think it is a good conversation starter or coffee table book in the appropriate living room."
2,Average book,"Ok. I did not like this book that much but it has some good information inside. It just felt like a cheap knockoff of ""How to make 1000 a minute"" yet it still had some fresh sections. If you only want one book on negotiation, pass on this one. If you already have 1000 a minute and want more info, get ""What color is your parachute""?If you got both and want more info, this one fits the bill. I give it a generous 2 stars because it has some ok tips and a very excellent chapter 9 ""Lessons learned from job applicants and employers"".That chapter along with the rest of the mediocre book, make for an average rating 2.5 out of five on a VERY generous scale. In fact on a non generous scale I would probably rate this a 1.If you still want this book, I'll sell you mine at half price."
1,worth it?,negotiating to yes it much better. Written by academics without real experience negotiating.
4,Kept me interested,"We learned ""who dunnit"" very soon into the story. However, the whys and hows were unraveled very slowly as the complexities of the characters was revealed. I found it hard to put the book down and came to respect Decker. In this book, the family angle was downplayed and the detective story progressed on its own with the majority of the focus on the actual solution of the ""crimes."" I recommend it."
2,I felt let down...,"I thought the author would tie up the loose ends at the conclusion of this story. I was wrong.Who really killed Cheryl? What happened to that steriod-popping friend of hers and Chris'? How did Terry expect to hide her pregnancy from Chris? What happened to the other men on the Cheryl videos? Did anyone actually see the Cheryl videos, or was Decker just bluffing? What actually went down when Decker got the promotion to Lt? Why didn't a tenacious copy like Decker follow-up on the ""leads"" that pointed to Chris as his uncle's hit man?I've liked the other Decker books, but this one fell short for me. There were just too many unanswered questions."
4,Scary,"I must admit, the beginning pages of the book really threw me off. I guess that is why I had to continue reading the book. It's a major thriller. Reading about how capable Chris Whitman was to commit murder scared me terribly. He was so passive, unreadable, and there was something about how she described his eyes that gave me the shivers and hoped that I would never meet a man like that in real life. Not only because I would be terrified by him, but because I, like Terry, might fall for him. To Terry he was sweet and innocent, making her believe that his every move was calm and soothing. Really he was a cold blooded murderer and the son of a Mafia leader. Being so open with Terry about his life only made her fall for him more and seduced her into believing he could do no harm. That he was a victim of his fathers, rather uncles, horrific life. Only that Chris left out his victims of his very own murders. But as they say, once a killer, always a killer."
3,"Strong characters, weak plot","Like many detective stories, the lives of the leading characters have taken center stage, while the plot is merely a background upon which to tell their story. Readers who have been following the series since its early days will be pleased. Those picking it up for the first time will be disappointed."
5,Faye Kellerman Justice,"The Faye Kellerman Peter Decker series is quite fascinating. With Faye's writing you can see the countryside, feel the inflicted pain, taste the food and somewhat understand the religion. I found the Chris Whitman quite mysterious and wicked and was glad to see this man of mystery showed up later in the series. You can read the Faye Kellerman books as a stand alone, which is what I was doing before I knew it was a series or you can follow the series. After I read a couple completely out of order I went back and started reading the entire series. Peter Decker, his work peers and his family are always a great read when you want to spend some time reading a book."
1,Justice,"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. I could not finish it, which is something I never do. It was sophomoric, poorly written, and I could not have cared less about the characters. My first and last try with Faye Kellerman and her inability to tell a compelling story with worthy characters."
1,One of Kellerman's worst!,"Kellerman's earliest Decker/Lazarus novels were different enough in character and plot to be a refreshing addition to the mystery genre. ""Justice"" reads as if it were thrown together by a hack writer. The characters are unbelievably bad, especially the teenagers. Kids that age do not engage in such ludicrous dialogue. I'm also disappointed in the degeneration of the Decker and Lazarus characters as the series goes on. Peter Decker gets crankier and less interesting, while Rina Lazarus becomes a boring drudge. Kellerman seems to have merely been fulfilling an obligation to crank out a book for her publisher with this drivel."
2,Disappointing,"The next person who reads this book should keep track of how many times the phrase ""He blew out air"" is used. . . This is my first Faye Kellerman and my last."
4,I wish there were a sequel.......,"I'm 15 years old and an avid fan of the Rina and Peter mystery series. I just finished reading Justice and I was slightly irritated at the ending, I wonder if (with enough fan mail) Mrs. Kellerman would write a sequel so we could find out what happens with Terry and Chris and their baby. Will he find out and get revenge? Will she ever tell the child who his/her's father is? I am in agony and I can't even go on to the next book in the series because I wonder what's gonna happen to terry."
4,what really happens at prom night ?,"Having read this book I still don't know what the main theme was. Is it a love story, a crime novel which follows a serial killer, a disturbing look on how teens spend their time on prom night, an inside look into a mafia family, or just a chilling detective story?Nevermind, it's up to detective Peter Decker to unravel the complex murder of a girl that was strangled on prom night. There is a nice balance between action and suspense(multiple murders) and the private life of Peter Decker when he talks to his wife Rina Lazarus about his hard and difficult life as a LAPD detective. This gives us a little time to relax, before the suspense starts all over again.Faye Kellerman is also great in describing Jewish rituals, which is interesting if you don't know anything about the Jewish religion. Another case for Peter Decker to solve, hopefully many will follow !"
5,JUSTICE - AWESOME book!,"I just read Justice and thought it was a GREAT book-it is probably my new favorite. I think that the ending was disappointing though (how Chris and Terry ended up), and I wish that Chris and Terry had gotten back together. The entire story was very well written and never boring, not a typical murder story. I wish that Ms. Kellerman would write a sequel to Justice because the characters were interesting...and I want to know what happens! I think a sequel would be great also because the end of Justice was a huge cliffhanger, leaving me dying to find out what is going to happen! Again, this was an EXCELLENT book!!! It's too good to describe in words - you just have to read it!"
5,amazing,"This sound is aboriginal psychedelia, how amazing that someone created such a multilayered and transcendental track from the mouth harp. far out, 5 stars man....dig the substrate"
3,Nice Deluxe Kit - But Perhaps Too Nice For Some...,"While this is a very nice digital pen kit, I must agree with the previous reviewer. Now that I have two digital pens to go with my Adesso Cyberpad, I'm more likely to need a new dummy cartridge or new ink cartridges next. I would like to see a smaller, lower cost kit available containing perhaps two ink cartridges and one dummy cartridge without the pen, battery, and tweezers.I have one pen loaded with a dummy cartridge and one pen loaded with an ink cartridge, which is ideal for me. Both are kept with my Adesso tablet so unlikely to get lost."
3,Decent,"This is a beginner's racket, good for developing strokes. However it is not for the very experienced player. It has decent spin, low speed, and the weight distribution is quite poor. I used it for a month, then sold it and purchased a custom racket. If you are looking to play recreationally this is a great racket, but if you are serious and want to play on a competitive level this may be a good racket to develop your game. THIS IS NOT A COMPETITION RACKET, SIMPLY NOT GOOD ENOUGH."
2,Good Racket but it is built terribely,The racket is good but it is not built to last. I used the racket a lot for a few weeks and then the paddle snapped. If you are a player who plays hard DO NOT get this racket.
5,Worked well for the past 6 month,"Pros: Seems to hold up, even with daily use. Adjustable to fit my 5'5"" frame/shoulder. Relatively inexpensive. Comfortable.Cons: None so far."
3,Do not get if you are short like me,Well the thing is the shoulder pad first of all does not fit on a 3/4 size violin. Which I use right now. I bought it because of all the good reviews. but it does not fit me. The height is really big so if you have a small neck also like me i would choose a smaller rest. Its pretty good overall.
4,Good,"This shoulder rest couldn't have taken more than two dollars to manufacture, and it's selling for thirty dollars. This is one of the best shoulder rests, but I think prices for shoulder rests are generally high and this should be closer to $15 or $20.It's basically a strip of foam attached to a moderately thick strip of metal with legs. The foam is nice and firm, the leg sleeves are coarse rubber, and it doesn't grip very well, but it never falls off because of the good design. It allows me to play with the violin more to the left and nearly parallel to the angle of my body. The Fom shoulder rest I had before couldn't stay on my shoulder for fifteen minutes, and it could not support me. I have a long neck, and other shoulder rests like Kun and Fom don't work for me."
2,For a tall neck!,"I never thought about my neck length until I got this shoulder rest. I don't know if I have a short neck or what, but this is for a longer neck than mine. It took me awhile just to figure out how to fit it to my violin. (not very user-friendly) I was starting to think it was for a viola in spite of it saying it should fit 3/4 - 4/4. After much experimentation, I got it to fit my 4/4 and it will barely stay on my daughter's 1/2 size, so it does have a good size range once you figure it out. However, to get it short enough for my neck, it ended up scratching the back of my violin - not pleased about that! I never did get it adjusted good enough to be comfortable for me. I called the company & they had great customer service. I was able to get a full refund without any problems or hassle."
2,be careful,"First off, let me say that I am trying to get back into the violin after a long absence, so I do not have a lot of experience with shoulder rests.I have tried all manner of positions for this shoulder rest and it simply has not worked for me. I realized after purchasing this shoulder rest that I might have been better served with the Wolf Forte Secundo, which looks like it has more positioning possibilities. Or, with a simple foam rest, which is much cheaper.The pad is not as soft as it looks in the picture. The plate is not quite as malleable as I had hoped. The clasping feet tend to fall off of the violin when I try more extreme positions.I think the product is over-priced. Don't get me wrong - it is decent and has held up under my manipulations. But at $29 I thought it would be softer, sturdier, and more malleable."
1,don't waste your money,"Don't waste your money buying this item. A regular baby play pen is a lot cheaper and works a lot better. This item is almost impossible to put up and down, and good luck getting the company to stand behind their product."
3,Great pictures of long-forgotten events and decent writing,"This book has great photos of long-forgotten events, many from the ""Golden Age"" of publicity stunts. It also has some decent writing about the stunts themselves and a not-bad bibliography. If you have an interest in the subject of publicity stunts, I would say ""Get it!"""
5,Great Practical Book for Raising Children.,This is a very practical book on how to raise children. Should be read by all parents.
1,Don't buy it!,"I haven't read this book, but I speak from experience as one of the children he helped rear at a Christian school. He's a nut, very holier than thou, strict, and left generations of students with emotional scars from ""growing up STORMER'S way."" If you have doubts check out message boards on Facebook like ""the REAL Faith Christian Academy"" and ""I survived Faith Christian Academy."""
1,WARNING: John Birch Society Nuttiness,"All books written by members of the conspiracy-addled John Birch Society ought to come with a warning label. Using God's name to peddle this nuttiness violates the Third Commandment. But, hey, if you want your kids to grow up somewhere way to the political right of Jerry Falwell and Alan Keyes, then you might just like this offering from the author of ""None Dare Call It Treason."""
2,.Not what I expected,I purchased Romance in Venice as I wanted some authentic Italian background music for a picture slide show.To me it is a little amateurish & not what I expected from reading reviews of others.
2,"Great plug, bad rebate.","I ordered four of these for my Honda, and they work great. However, I wasn't impressed with the ""rebate"" that is ""offered"" by Bosch. I sent in the forms with the correct UPC several months ago, and just recently received a letter stating they couldn't honor it with hardly any explanation given. I am decently sure I followed the instructions correctly.Here's a genius idea: If you don't want to give out a rebate, don't offer it. I'm not impressed by the bait-and-switch, and next time I'll probably buy from another company."
3,"Item is Great, Customer Service / Rebate GIMMICK SCAM !!","Keeping this review short..I bought these spark plugs a few weeks ago for my bmw 325i.Why did I chose Bosch over NGK? because of the rebate.. ""Too Good to be true""So I bought the plugs. Installed it. Nothing special.But before I even install this. I did the rebate first..After a month. I got a Postcard/letter saying that the rebate is invalid?????So I wrote back again. and now they are asking for the UPC. so I gave them a copy of the UPC from amazon.They said that it is invalid.. WTF????I dont know what's going on with this Rebate Scam.If you are planning to buy this plugs only because of the savings that you will get from the rebate. FORGET IT!buy a set from your local parts store would be better.\"
5,so far so good,"no noticeable power gains in the 99 maxima, but i didn't have to gap the plugs. that's a plus. i plan on changing the fuel filter which has never been done. hopefully, there'll be some noticeable power or mpg improvement."
1,terrible!!,I bought these for my BMW X3 and at least one was bad. I ended up going to the dealer and paying $600 for replacement of plugs and engine damage caused by them. DO NOT BUY BOSCH SPARK PLUGS IF YOU VALUE YOUR CAR. BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK
1,Slice of Fruitcake Mixed with Nut Shells,"If you like fruitcake and don't mind chipping a tooth on nut shells buried into this thing, this snack bar is for you. I tried this out based on the number of positive reviews and feel compelled to even things out a bit. I didn't much like the taste or texture of this bar, although I didn't think it was too sweet. You can definitely taste the dried apples and a bit of cranberry which is good, but it needs something else. And it could use something less - I've only eaten three of these bars so far, but two of them had nut shell fragments in them. I'm not fond of biting into something that can't be chewed (at least not by human teeth). Feed this one to the bears."
1,"Katana - Slim, but Cheap","I bought the Katana because I wanted a slim phone that slid into my uniform pocket easily, it accomplished this. But after a few months the hinge was loose and I noticed it lacked the features that some of the cheaper phones offered. I can do without features, but a flip phone that doesn't stay shut after a few months of normal use is not worth the money in my opinion."
4,bad battery,"Just wanted to enter this quick review incase it will help anyone else with the same problem. About 3 months after purchase the unit wouldn't power up unless I popped the battery out and then put it back in. Once powered up the battery appeared to be fully charged and it worked just fine so I didn't suspect the battery as the problem but it was. I replace the battery with one bought from an Amazon retailer. Now the phone works fine.As far as the other features; reception is good, camera is what you would expect. I am happy with it. If you want a lot of ringtones you might want to consider something else because I believe the only way to get new ones is buy them from Sprint."
4,Sprint Katana,"The sprint katana is a great phone, my only complaint is that the phone has a horrible selection of preset ringers, games, screen savers, and ringtones. Also the camera is not the best i've ever seen, but not bad.O and by the way the charger does get in the way when plugged in and talking.P.S. The phone CAN be set to level 8 AND vibrate at the same time!"
4,FInally a decent Sprint phone,"In my opinion, Sprint has not been keeping up with the trends in cell phone popularity. I think every single sprint phone is a ""flip"" phone. Every other carrier has come up with new ultraslim, slider/single phones. At least, the Katana is keeping up with the motorola ""Razor"" by offering a similar product. The features and functions are all pretty standard stuff. Worth noting is that this phone is ""blue tooth"" enabled. But shouldn't they all be?Overall, good phone."
3,Poor instructions,"Just got my Katana today, and am unhappy at the moment. The instruction manual is poor. I am trying to download ringtones, but the manual only gives instructions for Sprint's rip-off ringtones that only last 90 days. I can't figure out how to get it to work with other sites and the instruction manual doesn't give a hint. The preloaded rings are awful.As others have reported, there's no vibration + ringtone at most volume levels and the power cord is not convenient. Nor is the head set which requires a separate connector in addition to the head set wire (the blue tooth headset was out of my price range)."
2,Bad battery,"My biggest complaint with this phone is the battery. We have owned two of these phones for about 8 months and neither phone can hold it's charge for even 48 hours...never had this problem with any other phone before. The battery was even replaced once and after about a month it no longer held it's charge.This phone is uncomfortable to hold and does not flip open easily. There is a several second delay once the phone does open, so 'hello' is always cut off. It also picks up breathing sounds you don't even know you're making and drives the listener on the other end crazy."
1,USED MERCHANDISE SOLD AS NEW,"PURCHASED THESE SO CALLED HP CARTRIDGES NEW IN MAR 2012...JUST NOW NEEDED TO USE AND WHEN OPENED FROM FACTORY PACKAGE, THE CARTRIDGE OBVIOUSLY HAD BEEN USED, PACKAGE WAS OPEN ON THE INSIDE AND THE PROTECTIVE TAPE WAS MISSING FROM THE CARTRIDGE. UNIT WOULD NOT PRINT AT ALL, SO OBVIOUSLY HAD BEEN USED UP.WHAT A RIP-OFF...NOW CANNOT GET IT REPLACED!!!!!"
5,HP 59 Gray Photo Ink Cartridge,"I haven't actually used the cartridge yet, but anticipate that it will be just fine."
3,Antenna only has 14' of coax and no coax connector,"I have not had the antenna connected to the radio yet so I won't know how well it does till boating season, however I was disappointed it only has 14.5 feet of coax and did not come with a connector to attach to the radio. A local radio shop wanted $25 to install the connector. I got a local ham to do it for $15. A previous antenna had about 25 foot of coax and had a connector alread installed. I hope I can route the coax and make it work with only 14.5 foot of coax"
1,THE ITEM CAME CRACKED,THE ITEM CAME WITH 2 CRACKS IT WOULD OF COST ME MORE TO HAVE IT SHIPPED BACK SO I JUST GLUED AND PATCHED THE ITEM. WILL NOT ORDER AGAIN FOR AMAZON. Shakespeare 5101 Centennial White 8' VHF Marine Antenna
3,"Same book, different edition, different title","If your looking for other editions of this book, you should know that the authors/publisher keeps changing its title. The 4th edition of this book was published in 1991 under the title of ""Optical Eletronics"" and the 6th edition of this book published in 2006 under the titlePhotonics: Optical Electronics in Modern Communications (The Oxford Series in Electrical and Computer Engineering). All editions are essentially the same, with modifications to the material at the end."
1,Rehashed mediocrity.,"Same old, same old. This is more or less Qauntum Electronics in (yet) another cover. Yariv is a lousy presenter. The materials in this book are never really difficult. The reader, however, may have trouble following it from time to time just because it's poorly organized and presented. Make no mistake, optical electronics is no quantum field theory, and you should be able to pick it up over the time you spend over the commode. Rather than impeding your learning by battling the style of this book, do yourself a favor and get one of the several better alternatives already out there."
1,Disappointing,Nothing new. There are much better books on fasting. This one is not thorough or backed up by enough research.
4,Thorough history,"Wennersten's history was required reading for an English course I was taking on local landscapes and culture of the Chesapeake Bay, and initially, I had a difficult time getting into this book. The tone seemed overly ponderous and the language a bit stiff. However, as I continued to read, I became impressed with Wennersten's scholarship. He drew together tons of sources, provided a balanced view, and actually supported his own conclusions. The chapter on the oyster wars was particularly enjoyable, and the one on more modern environmental damage very eye-opening. I'm sure my jaw dropped open at least a couple of times.In the end, I donated my copy to the Penn State University library, believing that it should be available to anyone searching for information on the environmental history of the Chesapeake. Not a casual read, definitely, but Wennersten should be proud of what he put together."
4,Make You Think,The book catches you in the first paragraph. It was interesting to see how all the characters were woven together. Nothing is quite what it seems. It will take you an emotional rollercoaster. The only negative was Reverand Wright. What happened to him in the end?
1,NEVER get this product from the seller Avalon Hair Product!!!,"I have been using this product for the past 5 years and must say that it is an excellent product. However, NEVER get this from this seller. First of all, they sent completely wrong items, not to mention they were sent more than a week later than the nexpected date and even the ones they sent were completely damaged. when I contacted with them about it, they were not responsive at all for a long time, then when they did, it was the rudest possible. Those damaged items are still sitting in my apartment, but this seller is doing absolutely nothing about what to do next. I just cannot believe that Amazon is dealing with somebody like this seller...."
1,"A lame, unecessary book.","My two cents.The publisher wants you to think, in buying this title you'll have no need for nine other books to help you get the most out of Word 2007. That's cover puffery. There aren't any books out there on ""Inserting Bits and Pieces"" or ""Word's Brave New World"" or ""Mailings.""Worse, Word 2007 for Dummies is an extremely poor substitute for Microsoft's online help and Word's developers blogs. Have you visited those sites recently? Talk about fast, authoritative 'get in, get out' solutions.Finally, the Dummies trade dress; cheap paper; and lowbrow, patronizing tone is really tiresome. For comprehensive reference, there are much better books from Que and Microsoft."
2,Not Helpful!,I usually like dummie books but this one isn't very helpful. I need to format papers for school and I am still lost.
5,"Charanga , la Salsa mejor , bailable solamente con cubana.","Quieres que te charangeo mami - en cheque o effectivo. The best from Cuba together with ""Te pone la cabeza mala / Marcando la distancia / Yo no me parezco a nadie / Con la conciencia tranquila / De buena fe""."
1,A clunker,This device did not work properly from the get-go. It fails to hold a channel for more than a minute before the audio dissolves to noise. Sending it to the next station meets with the same result. It was a total waste of money.
2,"Works, but not as advertised",CONS: The product description says that it will remember the last track played. On my 4G memory this is important because if not then I would have to press the advance button through hundreds of songs to get to the one I want. The unit worked when I received it but did not remember the track! I was very disappointed and what's worse is I was on day 12 of a 7 day return policy!PROS: The price is good. The unit plays well. The sound is clear however on my truck sound system there was an underlying hiss present on all songs and on all stations. This hiss is not normally present on CD's played through the sound system. I did not notice this hiss present on my Lexus sound system. The overall fidelity was good but not great.I cannot use this because of the memory issue. I would not recommend this unit to anyone because of this.
2,Not Good,This FM Trasmitter is not satisfactory. The volume is not of high quality and not loud enough. I already had the Port Authority 2 FM Transmitter. That is far better than this product.Remote is also useless.It might be useful if you play USB. Haven't tried that though.Very dissapointed.
5,Extremely good product. I love it.,"The player that i received first did not remember the last played track and did not play in alphabetical order, though it was playing well. I wrote a mail to the seller. He said ""I dont like my customers to be unhappy"" and offered to send a free replacement. He sent the replacement in 3 days time as promised. The replaced one plays extremely well in alphabetical order and remembers last track it played. Above all, the quality of the FM transmitter is excellent. It is very worth for the amount i paid."
3,OK product not great though...,"I bought this product based on the reviews and thought it would work very well without any interference with the other FM stations being broadcast.I tuned and set this up for channels where there was no FM broadcast, as this would be the best way to reduce any interference. Although the product works fine and the sound output is good, there was a constant hissing sound in the background which is unlike any CD player.Though I would recommend this player to anyone who wants a nice FM transmitter at this price, i think its good price. But i would suggest that they check all the FM frequencies available on the product with the local FM station frequencies and match atleast one or two channels without any interference or crossover."
2,Great Device not very durable,"This little baby did just what I needed it to. The sound isnt crystal clear perfect, but it plays as well as a radio station. The remote is GREAT! But, the construction was poor and it started coming apart when changing flash drives. It also had trouble maintaining the station. It became very frustrating. With better construction this would have been awesome (and likely would have cost more...so you get what you pay for). Good product for about 2 months. It plays better in some car stereos than others. Worth having, but only as a temporary fix. Don't plan on months and months of use."
2,not value for money,The measurement & weight given in the site doesnt match with actual. It is considerably less in size compared to what is mentioned and weight also lower. No great deal
1,"Poor quality, plain and simple!","We've owned this faucet for four years now and have had multiple issues with this unit. First, the soap dispenser's material started to deteriorate inside the canister and clogged the dispenser. We tried to remedy the problem, but the material just kept flaking and shedding; mixing with the soap, so we were unable to keep it fixed. Second, the sprayers second setting stopped working and shoots water in every direction. Third, the plastic sheath under the sprayer broke and continually comes off.I've yet to contact PF about the problems, but plan to tomorrow. I hear they have pretty good customer service, so we shall see. I'll come back and report what I find."
2,looks good works bad,"I'm looking because I have this faucet in a house about 7 years old. The soap dispenser broke a year ago. When using the spray feature, you do have to turn the water all the way off to go back to stream. And the final kicker, the handle is leaking somewhere and I don't know were. I called the company and they were not familiar with the symptoms I gave (leaking somewhere up high and then dripping down into my cabinet. They thought it would be a part in the handle but also was surprised my water continued to come out of the faucet without loss of pressure. So for $25 I could buy a part that may or may not fix the problem. I chose to look for a new faucet. It looks good and other than the spray thing worked good when it worked."
4,The best kitchen faucet I've seen,"This faucet is by far the nicest and most functional I've ever used (mine is now about 2 years old). The pull out sprayer is amazingly useful and really handy. After 2 years, no drips, no problems. I would have given it 5 stars except for 2 things: the included soap dispenser dribbles for days after you use it (and I've had it replaced once) and the sprayer is somewhat awkward because once you set it to spray, you have to turn off the water to stop spray and go back to a stream.I'd still buy it again in a minute."
2,Quality & Design Issues,"I should have paid more attention to other people's comments. As others stated in their reviews, the faucet turns itself off unless it is wide open. This will drive you mad. I removed the handle and tightened the compression nut as much as I dared, but still the problem persisted. I have now had the set installed for a year and I guess enough deposits have built up internally that the self turn-off problem has subsided. The soap dispenser stopped working about 2 months ago. I found the the tiny hole at the tip seemed to be internally lined with plastic and was constricted. I used a 1/16"" drill and carefully drilled through the tip. This corrected the problem (at least for now). This set is expensive and should work better for the amount of money. Also, the extreme high rise of the faucet leads to horrible splashing problems."
5,Beautiful,"We saw this faucet in a local store, and loved the look of it .. way too high priced in the hardware store, but found it sub $200 here at Amazon.com .. beautiful faucet!"
3,Turns itself off,"I have also experienced the ""falling handle"" problem with this model. While it is sleek and seems otherwise well-built, unless the faucet is all the way on (up), the handle will eventually fall down and turn the flow off. This is particularly true with the hot water."
2,Poor Long-Term Durability,"We've had one of these for about five years. After about a year, the handle started falling off. We finally got it to stay on by glueing the handle on with GE Silicone II. Next, the rubber cover for the spray control on the pull-out started falling off. We finally gave up and left it off. It's still sitting in a drawer by the sink. Now the control assembly is leaking under the sink (all connections are secure--a plumber confirmed the control assembly is the problem). Now we have to decide whether to repair or replace. We're reluctant to repair it,because we have had so much trouble with it."
4,excellent,"Its worth to pay $39.99 and my son really enjoying with this item. shipping was on time, while my son playing with power game his mind is active to achieve highest score he's very happy with his score/ points. which makes me feel comfortable that he's not bothering me, i evaluate this game an excellent for children above 5+."
5,Jamieson opens the door of,"Packaging the presidency is the most complete and accurate book about presidential advertising and communication of the period ending with the 1992 presidential election. Sometimes humorous, sometimes cynical, Kathleen Jamieson takes us in a travel back in time within the intricacies of political communication strategies. This is the best book that I have ever read on this subject. This book was recommended to me by another Presidency specialist, Stephen J. Wayne, when I was studying at Georgetown: this book is really a must read! Thanks Kathleen and thanks Professor Wayne."
2,More of a dictionary.,"If you're looking for a basic dictionary to tell you what certain words are then this might be what you want, although if you are a true southerner then you'll already know what all of these words are anyway. I was looking for origins for these terms and phrases and this book doesn not offer that information."
4,"""Jazz Etudes""","Don't throw away your old Hanon! This book is not tied to the successfull formula of the origional Hanon. It replaces the repetition and drill-like nature with a set of short, progressive jazz studies. But while initially misled by the title, I find this different approach successfull. With little explanation or theory I've been able to progress significantly just by working my way through the book -- moving on to the next exercise as soon as I feel comfortable with the last. For those of us who feel a little like a fish out of water in Jazz, this is a great way to learn to breathe air."
1,don't waste your money!,"This book reminds me of one of those low budget horror movies. The writing is pretty elementary and undeveloped. However, I had just finished reading a novel by Dan Simmons and I guess that didn't help. If you enjoy Dean Koontz, Robert McCammon, Stephen King, and Dan Simmons then this book will probably be a disappointment."
1,F-A-K-E,This product is not authentic. You can tell from the box in the picture. You shouldn't put MAC on products that are not actually from MAC. You probably bought this from some factory on eBay for like 4 bucks.
4,Great Rythm on every song.,"La Charanga Habanera provides a rythm rich Cuban music. This CD is great to improve my mood when I don't feel happy.Regretfully all music arrangements are the identical (Chorus I, Song words, Chorus II, Chorus III, Chorus IV)."
5,Silky Smooth Sailing,"Soul & BossaLisa Ono is Japan's most famous bossa singer, who was born in Brazil. With her silky smooth brazilian style vocal, this CD filled with American Oldies from the 60's to the 80's, yet Lisa has transformed them into her own unique bossa nova sound.I have to say that this CD is a must for all bossa nova fans to collect."
3,Good cups Bad deal,"These cups fit the bill perfectly for what they are, just the right size, comfortable in the hand and the grip feature helps smaller hands keep on it.Too bad that for the same amount of cups I can spend $24 (before tax) at my local walmart to purchase this many."
5,We love this book,WE love this book. Keeps us laughing. We are glad we got it. We also ordered one for a firend for his birthday and he loves it also.
2,Bad customer service,"I ordered these strings for my business. After waiting and waiting I called the company Musicians Friend. They told me they no longer carried the strings. Period. No ""sorry for the inconvienance or we'll send you out something simular or gee did we cause your business inconveniance?"" When I asked if they had something simular I could buy I was told, ""we have lots of strings you'll just have to go on line and look."" Which is what I had done before. I might as well buy lottery tickets, at least then I know the odds of getting what I paid for."
2,Let's Go Austria and Switz-a big step down,"I've been a budget traveler in Europe for 20 years, and have always relied on the ""Let's Go"" books to take me not only to the well-known spots cheaply, but point out some places I might not otherwise have seen. This edition of Let's Go made me wish I hadn't left my '00 edition in the train station when I left. It devotes a miniscule # of pages to Switzerland, and lists almost no side trips or off the beaten path sites. The restaurant and accomodations reviews seem likely accurate but superficial, and the numbers of places reviewed has dropped by about 50% in my estimate. Also missing are several former great spots, like La Chaux de Fonds, and its watch museum(probably the most interesting and well-set up museum in Switz), and the Museum of Art and History in Geneva itself. I'd recommend ""The Rough Guide to Switz"" instead. It has the kind of detail that the older editions had, especially if you want to see the real Switzerland."
2,"Expect stomatch upset and a cloying, gritty sweetness","The positives: tastes like chocolate milk, has a lot of good quality calories.The negatives: powder does not dissolve well at all and stays clumped -- tends to float first (so top of liquid is full of powder and denser than at the bottom of the glass) and then sink so that you can't drink it all. Overly sweet. Causes a lot of intestinal gas.I've stopped drinking mine. This is for serious body builders with iron stomachs only."
5,Read this Book,The Navarre series are absolutely a must for anyone wanting to gain a better understanding of the Gospels and other parts of the Bible. It breaks down each passage and provides the Latin text as well. Although the average reader may not understand Latin its inclusion makes it very interesting and educational as well. Excellent reference for Biblical study.
1,No stars for this book,"As a public librarian who is also in charge of ordering and circulating children's books, I was horrified when I previewed this book. I would never put this book on our library shelves. Even though perhaps the hidden point of the book is to decide who is the actual ""beast"" in the story, the point does not come across and the young reader stands a good chance of being traumatized by reading this book."
3,Generally helpful for trip planning,"If you expect to be able to drive all over Spain with this atlas alone, you will be disappointed. I bought this primarily to help plan a driving trip across Northern Spain, and in conjunction with the GPS we got with our rental car, had virtually no trouble getting anywhere. There just isn't enough city detail. Word up: you should not plan to navigate to your hotel in Bilbao with anything less than directions from your hotel because even the GPS is useless there (too much construction).The pages are not particularly heavy or laminated, so this book is definitely for grownups - a certain delicacy is required when moving between maps so that you don't tear anything.All that said, I didn't tear any of the pages, I'm glad I bought it and would do it again."
1,Unreliable,"We purchased the first PDR-M25 on 5/16. It lasted for 31 days, and then it would not turn on. Toshiba exchanged it for another camera (same model). When the replacement came, it would NOT take a picture when it first came out of the box. Then it took a few pictures, and then seized up again and the shutter button would not work. Toshiba sent another camera, same model, and it lasted 61 days before it refused to focus properly and the flash got out of sync with the shutter. I am awaiting camera #4, as Toshiba refused to send my money back."
1,This piece of junk died on me,"Usually, I have good experiences with Toshiba's products. For example, I have a Toshiba DVD player that I am very happy with. However, this digital camera was a disappointment in almost every aspect. A minor gripe was the short battery life, but that's a very common problem with digital cameras in general. Major problem #1: This camera has a VERY hard time focusing in low-light situations. Unless you're in a brightly lit room or outside on a sunny day, your pictures stand a good chance of being out of focus. Major problem #2: I owned this camera less than six months when it refused to recognize the existence of batteries. I tried many different types of fresh batteries, but it says they're all dead. Now I have to look into getting warranty service. If I had it to do over, I would have invested a little more in a higher-quality camera (and a brand other than Toshiba). You really do get what you pay for when it comes to digital cameras."
1,don't bother,"I am so relieved to see other bad reviews about this camera. This camera was given to me as a gift, but I have never liked it. The picture quality is awful and it is bulky and hard to handle. There are a few ways to get around some of the problems, but they too time consuming when you just want a camera to take a few great candid shots. Life is too short to use a poorly designed camera.It has nothing to do with knowing how to use a camera.All previous reviewers have said everything else that needs to be said."
1,PDR-M25,Camera broke after only 1 year of use. The zoom quit working. I agree about the poor indoor or low light photos. If the batteries were not new and the expensive kind it would not take good photos. I got a cannon wide zoom now and there is no comparison.
3,Good for the money,"This camera is of medium size, medium resolution (2.2mp) and medium quality (the flash cover fell off - who would have thought?). It has cool 3x optical zoom. It eats batteries up like candy, but I bought rechargeable, longer lasting ones so its not such a problem. Its lens cap doesn't stay on.The low down: if you want a camera the takes beautiful pictures, spend... more on a fancy newer model with 3.2 or higher resolution.If you want a camera that is cost effective and records memories and does all the same stuff as any other digital camera (it even has some special settings which I haven't investigated much, like shutter speed) in only very slightly imperfect 2D form, buy this one used and be careful with the lense and flash cover (though it's absence doesn't seem to affect performance)."
1,Waste of money,"This was my first digital camera and I spent my hard earned money on it. Picture quality indoors was very poor, outside was ok. Downloads were easy and fast. Battery life was a joke,it would never be consistant on how long they would last a day or two weeks..I used rechargable ones from the start and had two kinds it never made a difference.Now after 6 mo the camera will not recognize the charged battery at all.I have tried every thing new batteries 3 kinds and still nothing . So basically I have a useless camera,tech support at Toshiba is worthless and no one will work on the camera around here..they tell me to throw it away and buy something other than Toshiba.Great! Well that finished me with ever buying a Toshiba product again and you can be sure I will tell EVERYONE I know, that they need to look elsewhere for a better company and product."
1,Model PD3300 Digital Camera,"I have owned serveral Toshiba products ie TV-VCR-DVD player; This is my first digital camera. This camera is the most aggrevating electronic piece of junk I have ever owned. I have called Toshiba service (a waste of time) switched to other S/D cards and batteries.The camera works when it wants to, quits when it wants to, and doesn't work most of the time. When my $3600.00 Cinama series TV had a problem they sent someone to fix it; a few hundred for one of their cameras wont even get you a return call if you have a question. I am now the proud owner of a Fuji S3100 (great camera)which I purchase from Amazon.com(which is a good company to deal with) the PD3300 sets on my desk as a paper weight and reminder to never buy something with the Toshiba name on it. I hope I saved you some grief and money. Sincerely [...]"
2,Batteries eaten four at a time rapidly,"It does everything it's supposed to do but all you'll do is change the batteries. Moreover the battery symbol on the camera goes from ""full"" to ""empty"" with no warning. Someone else said it but I'll repeat...a battery HOG."
2,Disappointing,"I was so happy when this book was over. I'm a big fan of Connie Mason but this book was not one of her best reads it had potential but just didn't make it for me. I got so tired of the author mentioning belle's leg, okay we know it's ""lame"" as it was mention over and over again. Belle not trusting Casey was wearing me OUT. Get this one from a friend or the library."
4,The Toy Tree,I thought this book was great. It really got into the mind of child driven by a demon. The details were awesome. But i do not think a book is ever perfect so i gave it a 4.
2,Campy thriller,Michael Gough plays a zoo owner who uses his animals to kill anyone who threatens the future of his business. This is a pretty mediocre movie other than a couple of amusing scenes where Gough gets to address his lounging big cats as if they were humans listening to Shakespeare--otherwise this is slow moving and not very suspenseful.
4,TESTIFY!!!,"Excellent product. wish it came with a carrying case but, those are easy to find.Comes with one remote test dongle so, be sure to get the add on packages if you really want to use this product for more than cable testing...Also, really lightens the mood of a job site during testing to be able to get it out and start preachin' about TESTIFY!!! hehehe"
5,Its Great!!,"This CDG is great. It exactly what I needed, for a party of 13 year old kids! They all liked the music!!"
4,making better use of social services,"The motivating idea is the Prometheus Principle, where citizens are persuaded to make full use of social workers and others. It addresses a widespread problem, where resources are available, especially in terms of such workers, but people who really need these services do not fully partake of them.The context is quite varied. One chapter looks into the rights of medical patients. While another chapter discusses the classroom scenario. And yet another chapter bruits the use of subjects in psychological research, and the rights that they have."
5,breathtaking,Incredibly heartwarming! Please purchase this film and you will amazed amazed at how you can gather tips and ideals of how to overcome disappointment. Take the bad and turn it into Good.
3,I still haven't seen this movie yet,I was the one who asked if Brandy was in this but I guess she isn't though I was bumbed
4,3 1/2 Stars I really enjoyed this series,"I have read all of this series now and I have enjoyed all of them. Good romance, not much sex to speak of but a good basic medieval romance series. Every story had a different base and it was great to have characters from the previous stories show up for one reason or another. If you are not looking for erotic romance but just a nice simple romance then this series might be for you? Sweet easy to read love stories with some really good characters along with a few bad ones of course."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE,This pedometer is horrible! It is not sensitive enough so it only counts about half the steps you take! Buy something that actually works!
4,Good sensitivity in measuring steps,"I have had several pedometers, and know that getting the steps to calibrate correctly can be difficult. This one was very easy and very accurate. I walk outdoors and on a treadmill. When I count my steps to see if they match what records it is always within a couple and no more than 10 steps different. (I count 100 steps) It is important to wear the pedometer on the waist band of your pants over the middle of the thigh. I have found it does not count steps if it is tight against my body, such as if I am shoveling snow. For a walk in the snow it works, but the tiny steps of shoveling or the fact that it is tight to my body with my heavy clothes, it does not count my activity as well. Still I have been happy with it for regular daily wear.I did drop it though and the plastic broke so it does not flip down anymore. It just comes off and snaps back on. It did not come with the tie on to avoid this from happening."
2,broke the second day I used it,"Although this product is easy to use, it broke the second day I used it. I found that the device would not stay closed and does not count the steps you take unless it is closed properly. I'm now on line looking for another pedometer."
4,Great motivation!!!!,"This pedometer works really well!! I aim for 10,000 steps a day and have found that it is quite accurate and easy to read. The controls are simple to use as well. Overall, I would recommend this product for hassle-free walks!!"
1,Overpriced and only for running,"After participating in a program at the office that encouraged us to walk by giving us pedometers and record sheets, I was addicted and bought this one after the program was over. Bad choice. (It does have a reset button, far left - hold it down for 3 seconds. The instruction are inside the background card of the bubble packaging that has sketchy instructions on the back, I had to call the company to find this out) It only measures acuratly while running. The pendulum is heavy and not very responsive. I wore it side by side with the program pedometer and found it only measured 1/3 of the steps. It worked best when hooked to my bra but the unattractive bulge was not tolerable. Running, it was more accurate.If all this doesn't phase you, buy it at Walmart - Less then 1/2 the price even with tax, not counting the horrendous shipping charge (from this partner of amazon store, no super saver here) and you can return it easy."
2,Sportline quality dropping,"Buyer beware on this item. I've been using these little Sportlines for about 5 years now with pretty good results. Good enough to justify the price. I recently bought two more to replace units I'd damaged or lost, or that simply quit working. Both new units were defective. The mechanical side failed on one - was frozen and would not move. The other unit counted about one step of every 5. The seller took them back with no problem, but save yourself some grief and buy a better unit. These are made in China now, and live up to China's reputation for producing low-quality goods with little or no quality control."
2,so-so,"Owned (2) Sportline 345 Electric for nearly 12 years, but probably only used them a couple weeks in the beginning. Then lost interest. Put away in storage. Brought back out to use in 10,000 step Challenge at work. Besides the batteries needing replaced, which were not of a common size, one failed the second day after bringing out of storage. It might be due to wearing during 1 hour of volleyball. The other is still working after day 4. It too was used during volleyball."
4,Great pedometer!,"I was skeptical at first. This is my first pedometer, and the only reason I had never bought one before is because I had heard from many friends that they can be difficult to calibrate. But I found that calibrating this model was a snap.The Sportline 345 is relatively basic. It tracks steps, distance, and calories, and it has a clock. It does not have the capability to save your data over several days, so you just have to reset each time you want to use it.The clip keeps it relatively secure on my waistband, but I have two boys under the age of 2, and they have a habit of pulling or knocking the device off. Fortunately it stills runs perfectly even after many bounces on the floor.One word of advice ... shop around. I bought this model and found other Sportline pedometers for a LOT less money at a major discount department store. The price here is pretty much the only reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 5."
1,pedometer,"A piece of ""you know what"". It doesn't have a reset button, so the only way I could figure out to reset it everyday was to open the case on the back and take out the battery then put it back in, after a couple of days of doing this, the pedulum stopped working. So, buy a better model. I know I'm going to."
1,Just doesn't work!,This pedometer seemed to have all of the features I wanted but that isn't important if it won't do what it is suppose to do. It does not register your steps. Most of the time it just stays on a number. Save your money and look else where for a better pedometer.
2,Concerned about potency after shipping,"""Culturelle must not exceed 75 degrees Fahrenheit."" That's on the box. The box guarantees potency only if those instructions are followed.We all know trucks can get hot inside. So I've tried to get this product shipped to me in cold pack. Several vendors have refused, saying, ""we ship it in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations.""So I called the manufacturer. They said it was safe to ship by ordinary means. But how do they know? When I asked for written proof, they had none. Then I learned that they had acquired this product, and the original manufacturer used to ship it in cold pack. So I am concerned.After shipping, does the guarantee of potency on the box mean anything? How would I know if this product were heat damaged? Is it going on a reputation that it no longer lives up to?"
2,not what I expected,"Its not at all what I hoped for, I have been taking this faithfully since I recieved it and yet nothing has happened to to take care of my constipation"
1,Useless,"I have taken this for an entire month and there has been no improvement in my health. Maybe it will work for you, but it doesn't cure anything, and definately not IBS."
2,Very Dissapointed with the CD,"I purchased the book a week ago, with the intention of sharpening my math skills via the 4 sample tests provided on the CD-Rom. I have now taken 3 of the 4 math tests and have found over half a dozen errors, such as problems that are missing the correct answer, repeat answers, and answers that the computer thinks are right but are actually wrong. When I plop down $20+ I expect something that has been carefully edited and free of mistakes. The book might be great, I haven't had time to look through it, but the CD is very dissapointing. To do over again I would buy a good ACT book, minus the crudy CD, for half the price. Once I find the receipt I am going to get my money back."
4,Has everything I need in one bottle.,"My dr. recommended this supplement for me 3 yrs ago for when I was sick with possibly CFS. I had to quit my job due to extreme fatigue among other problems. It seemed to help me along with other supplements I was taking to get better. I tried to find other supplements like this one, but couldn't find one that had everything this supplement had, so I came back to this one. I don't 'do' powders or liquids so that's why I chose the capsules. Although it is expensive, you can find it cheaper if you look around on Amazon."
5,Great!,"This one is sexy and touching. I like all kinds of romance. Everything from Lindsey to Feehan. A true test for me is does it keep you turning pages and hoping it will never end. I put Susan Grant way up on my list of favorite authors such as Howard, Brown, Rogers and many others including my latest Fun, sexy read, ""Anything, My Love"" by Cynthia Simmons. The romance you want the heros you'll love."
5,A FABULOUS READ,"I found this TT to be absolutely delightful! Not only was thisromance satisfying, but it was extremely well-written andwell-crafted. (I'd been put off by poorly written time travels in the past.) For this reason, Grant has joined my small list of ""must-buys."" The characters were vivid, and elicited the exact emotion I'm sure the author intended: love, hate, tenderness, compassion, and revenge.Sadly, I almost didn't buy this book, based on June's review below. June, you were not misled. Whether you enjoy a book or not is a matter of taste. If you were expecting 400 pages of bickering crowned by the Big Misunderstanding (judging by your five-star reviews), I can see why you were disappointed. This is a grown-up romance, you see, a wonderful surprise from an author I'd never heard of, but whom I'm certain will make a wonderful name for herself in the future. Her next book looks equally intriguing. I shall look forward to it."
3,A satisfying read,"Overall, I enjoyed this book. It grabs your attention from the beginning and does a fairly decent job of holding it. I liked both of the romantic characters, and I enjoyed the fact that the woman, Carly, had some of the objects from her time still on her possession when she went back in time. That helped to add more intrigue to the story and keep it fresh. I also appreciated the fact that Carly acted like what she was, a modern day woman -- even though she found herself in the past. And more importantly, Andrew didn't seem to mind her ""different"" ways at all.Despite all that is likeable about this book, it wasn't the best romance novel I've ever read. While the characters liked each other, I didn't feel that ""electricity"" between them that I like in such stories. Because of this, the book wasn't as good as I had expected from the reviews. But nonetheless, it is a good story and it is worth reading."
5,Great Beach Book!,"This one wasn't too deep, but it was _highly_ entertaining cover to cover: nice love story, great characters, and a surprise ending on top of that.Warning: it opens with a plane crash. Read that part on the ground not in the air. Otherwise head to the beach and ENJOY!"
3,Gift Book,"It came on time, it was new as advertised, it was not much money. I had read a ebook version earlier and it was good, but the best part was the last part of the book."
4,An Excellent Read!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I admit I'll never look at mangoes in quite the same way! I very much cared about the characters and what happened to them. The ending came as quite a surprise and I loved the resolution. The pace was fast and never slowed for me. I would have prefered the book to be even longer, but I suppose that's because I didn't want it to end!"
3,Mild time-travel romance,"This was Susan Grant's debut and I could tell. I read both her books in the '2176' series and CONTACT and I enjoyed this author, so after reading this I could see how much she has improved in her writing over the years.ONCE A PIRATE is a time-travel romance with a weak heroine who is suppose to be a fighter pilot during present times. She is the center of a bitter feud in the past between our hero, Andrew Spencer, and Richard, the Duke of Westridge. Hence, the reason she travels in time.Besides our milk-toast heroine I found the story lacking that important tension/chemistry that is needed in a good romance. The plot was simple and after finishing the story I wondered if I could have used my time doing other things."
3,ok read,I bought this book because of all the good reviews. I can't say I enjoyed it as much as other people but it was cute and ok although I was unable to finish the book.
2,Not what I expected,"I read some of the wonderful reviews posted here and I purchased Once A Pirate. I was highly disappointed. Weak, simpering, characters give me a headache. I would also expect Andrew, who is the leader of the Pirate Ship, to not have such upstanding, prudish, traits. poor Characterization is a huge disappointment, but then again, maybe it's just me."
5,Big Help,This cd set is an excellent tool. It is easy to follow and breaks Torts down step by step. If you are an auditory learn this set is invaluable.
5,Great mixes!!!,"Tarkan is the most awesome turkish artist. I highly recommend you this CD, it is great, specially the Ozinga Disco Mix. Excelent rhytms and wonderful voice of our Tarkan on this CD and the others of him!."
4,A collection of explanations and inspirations,"Mathematicians may be extraordinary thinkers, but they occasionally have something inspirational or profound to say as well, and many of those sayings have been collected in this book. It is clear that the author considers this a labor of love, as the amount of research that had to be done to put this book together must have been very substantial. The quotes are organized into categories such as ""the creative process in mathematics"", ""mathematics and the arts"", ""about mathematicians"", ""anecdotes and humor"" and ""mathematics education."" This makes it much easier to find a quote where the point coincides with the one you want to make.If there was ever a mathematics book designed for browsing, it is this one. Find a copy and spend some time looking through it. It is an effort well spent."
5,gormet bites,"Such fun recipes! Not difficult, but tasty and they present beautifully. So glad I bought it!! Sometimes you just want to have fun with your food, THIS is the book for that!!"
5,Gone too soon,"I really enjoyed the change in venue for LAW & ORDER when they began an LA spinoff. The lawyers and police had a decidedly west coast flair and the sets were pure LA. I really like that NBC was venturing into TNT territory explored in their THE CLOSER, and I thought the cast had real potential to gell, but it didn't happen fast enough to net enough viewers, apparently. However, the series worked for me---especially bringing Alfred Molina on board frist among the lawyers then back on the street.The plots were intriguing, not immediately solvable, and again, had that west coast vibe.All good things must come to an end, but I look forward to getting this set when it become available and will enjoy seeing the episodes again and again."
3,Not L&O NYC,"I thought the partner detective, Rex, removed from the series in a drive-by shooting was very good. I thought the weakness was in the DAs. Anyway fine quality image, nice packaging, pretty good stories, and glad I have this in the long line of L&O spin offs."
3,It's okay...,"I am one of the most avid lovers of Law and Order so I thought I would give this a try. I gave it a fair chance but in the end I must say, I'll just have to stick with the others. I see why it didn't last that long during its premiere season. I was totally shocked when they killed the most handsome character off in the first few shows... that was a heartbreak and I almost didn't watch the other shows. But I did and still wonder why. The switching up of the roles was odd and the plots were okay. In my opinion, it was not on L&O caliber. But oh well... it was worth a shot!"
3,playa rae sucks,Fade Dogg and Gemini are two of my favorite rappers but the songs that neither of them where on brought the quality of the whole album down.
3,Perfect Pre-Teen TV,"I bought this for my 11 year old daughter-who loves Joe Jonas. This was perfect for her. I am not a Jonas fan and do not feel they are great actors or singers, but this is perfect for the audience they are aiming for the pre-teen to teen girls. I like to sit down with my daughter when she is watching Tv so I am aware of what she is getting exposed to. Their music is tolerable, their acting is sometime cringeworthy, but also tolerabel for us parents. All in all for the group it is geared to. Very good. For us mothers--tolerable."
3,purchase of Jonas,I am happy with the dvd but I was disappointed because there was no sleeve over the box or the magnets that was suppose to come with it. I had bought this one before for a niece and it had the sleeve and the magnets so I was expecting the same.
4,Endearing and Funny,If you missed this series on Disney it's worth a view. I was impressed with how well these young musicians handled the slap stick comedy.
1,Editorial Review?,"""More cool it does not go?"" Sometimes Google Translate doesn't work as well as we would like. I haven't watched it. The Editorial Review just amuzed me. Caveat emptor."
2,Not her best work,generally a big fan of Cara Black but this latest is a big mound of material searching for a decent editor. Even for a big fan its a slog. I think that there is a fine book buried in the text but whomever is claiming to be the editor of this book should be fired - it's a mess. Second Draft (maybe) but ready for publication it is not!
5,The best way to teach drawing I've ever seen!,"I was thrilled when I received my copies of Steve Barr's books. His approach to teaching the art of drawing cartoons is fantastic! From the beginning, he points out that there are ""No Rules!"". I love this approach for teaching children, and also for ""big kids"" like myself! People of all ages will learn a lot from his books, and have so much fun along the way. Each book shows step-by-step ways to accomplish adorable cartoons. I highly recommend this book to parents with budding artists, and to schools for their art classes!"
3,Cute & Fun,"Cute and fun artwork, and easy to duplicate even for children. My only gripe on this book is that it is VERY short, so I guess you get what you pay for, plus there is very little overview or explanation to help you draw anything other than what is pictured in the book. If you just want to draw the images they have, its a great start to get a hold on the concepts but you would definitely need a more advanced book almost right off the bat."
5,Don't know why this is out of print!,This is a fantastic cookbook for quick meals that don't require lots of expensive ingredients. Most of my cookbooks require you to buy lots of spices or fresh herbs or other ingredients that I will never use again. This cookbook is full of delicious recipes that mostly use staples from your kitchen and that kids and a picky husband will actually eat! I love it.
4,Different take on Wonder Woman,"I have always been a Wonder Woman fan since the comics so I was excited for theanimated version. The story is this - Ares, God of War, has escaped from hisimprisonment on Themyscira and Hippolyta, the Queen of the Amazons, must send achampion to get him back. Hippolyta holds a contest and the champion will becomeWonder Woman. However Diana, Hippolyta's daughter wants to be the champion, buther mother has forbidden it. So she disguises herself and wins. As Wonder Woman,Diana goes to Man's World with the help of Steve Trevor, a man who has crashed onthe all-woman isle.Excellent voice casting and a decent retelling of how Wonder Woman came to be.However that being said, this is a revision of the Wonder Woman story, not theone told in the comics. I would read the comics too. The basic elements of thestory are there. It's PG-13. There is a little violence and suggestive material.I would suggest this for teens rather than for children."
3,It could've been much better.,"I like Greek mythology. I like Wonderwoman. But, I think something went wrong here. We see a bunch of clay (Diana) to defeat a God, Ares!!! I remember the DC Universe reconstruction after Crisis on Infinite Earths, and, on my opinion, the best character stories after this event was Wonderwoman, but, even there, she couldn't defeat Ares, only make him to see the truth, but, on this animated movie, I consider the God of War was clearly underpowered, as even Hypollyta defeats him too. Not a big antagonist, I think. But, the animation quality in inquestionable: perfect from the beggining. The problem is the leak of a little good sense here."
2,Disappointmet!,I waited for a couple months and finally got Wonder Women. Wow what a disappointment. I was expecting so much more like how George Perez told the story. I'm not selling this movie I will give it away.....see ya!
5,Best of the DC animated movies,"With the exception of the terrible ""Public Enemies"" I generally feel DCs animated original films are fantastic. However none shines brighter than Wonder Woman. This film is simply brilliant. The cast, animation, the story are all in perfect form. A must own. Before, Wonder Woman was just another good character in the DC's line-up of heroes; however this movie has made me a fan of the amazon princess. Keeping my fingers crossed for a second one."
3,Writing could have been better,"First, I will confess that I purchased the movie not knowing it was PG-13 so consequently I have not shown it to my superhero-worshipping preschooler yet. I however, being a superhero-worshipping adult, did watch it. I thought the story was good but the issue I have is with some of the writing. I do not know if the writers/producers knew they would have a PG-13 so they wrote the sex jokes to justify that or they just wrote the story and it ended up warranting the rating. The war violence/blood was probably the reason behind the rating so I don't know why the sexual (esp. breast) jokes were needed at all - I am not a prude - they were just dumb and did not add anything to the story. As some others have noted the character of Steve Trevors was poorly written with his attitudes on women straight out of the 40s or 50s and his improbable superhuman strength and fighting skills that could match WW's for a time."
2,Blunder Woman....,"Unlike the other recent offerings from DC, this one was definitely the weakest of the series. In future I will just enjoy her in JLU where she shines, sorry.ROBOTRON"
4,Who dosen't like Wonder Woman,"This was bought as a gift for a true wonder woman fanatic, and she just loved it."
3,"Good movie, not all features work outside of US","The movie was very enoyable, with good voice performances and animation. The story was respectful to previous versions of the origin, but has been updated in a way that was appropriate for the character.Only complaint is that the digital version intended for iphones and ipods is not available to customers outside of the US and Canada.."
2,Apparently in the minority,"I was so excited to see that a WW movie was coming out as I am a big fan and I love Justice League. I was shocked an appalled over and over by how terribly they treated the characters in this. Steve Trevor was portrayed as a sexist pig-which WW ends up falling for? What a joke! The comments and adolescent behaviors continue through the entire movie! Even a comment about how much he likes her ""rack""! He sees Amazons playing and splashing naked in a paddling pool--why are they not portrayed as doing something strong and athletic? Then, when they save the world, a presidential aid calls them a bunch of supermodels??I only gave it two stars for a couple of cool battle scenes and for the portrayal of Hippolyta, who truly is the example this WW should have been. Very disappointed, Hollywood!"
3,Wonder Why,"Male bashing brought to new heights. OK, so it wasn't quite that bad but with all this time it would have been better to demonstrate more of a background of why the extreme response. Of course the male character was written to be pretty ineffectual and yet generally insufferable. I was hoping a 2009 remake might be a bit more ballanced."
5,"maybe i'm a just geek, but...","i long anticipated this wonder woman animated flick and i must say, it did not disappoint. the story is solid as both an origin and the first part of what could be several sequels. it really lays the ground work to leave you thirsty for more! the highlight for me was definitely nathan fillion as steve t. he brought just the right amount of humor. of course, that the story was co-written by gail simone is a help. she had the best run of birds of prey comics i have ever read. i expect a lot of action from a wonder woman feature and this had more than i hoped for with its bullets, beheadings and, of course, babes. ""keri russell as wonder woman..."" was never the beginning of a sentence i thought i would say, but i must admit, she pulled it off. and kudos need to be given to both virginia madsen and rosario dawson. this flick is a must for any ww or dc fan."
2,Underwelming,The fact that wonder woman falls in love with a chauvinist pig really throws off the story. I think it would had more purpose if they would have ended as friends.
2,It's a man's world baby!,"Yes - the animation is nicely done & all but I had to give this dvd only 2 stars - because SEXIST REMARKS ARE NEVER OK. If Steve Trevor was not in this movie then it would've got 4 stars-easily. When he makes comments about Wonder Woman's breasts, like, ""She's got a nice rack!"" makes you wanna cringe. I was hoping he'd get killed off in the end but instead he ends up kissing Diana. WHY-must every strong woman need a man to ""balance"" off her warrior like qualities? Why can Diana just save the world but she needs a sexist love interest to reassure viewers that she's a ""real"" woman. Is anyone else as offended as I am? It doesn't matter if the animation is high quality, the script - sucks."
5,Woman Wonderful,"George Perez should be so proud. This animated retelling of Wonder Woman's origins and her first adventure into man's world is a rich tapestry of mythology, sisterhood and feminine mystique. There is tragedy, passion, faith and triumph. While some of the themes are very adult, my eight year old really enjoyed seeing a female, powerful hero which Wonder Woman has always represented. You can see more of a lengthier review about the film here: http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/1545777/wonder_woman_2009.html?cat=40But if you're on the fence and you're a fan of the Wonder Woman comic, buy this -- it really is exceptionally well done and respectful of her myth and legend."
5,Wonder Woman Review,"The animation was very good. The storyline explaining her origin was well written. I would recommend this DVD to anyone! However, this IS NOT a cartoon for children! There are some battle scenes that are ONLY APPROPRIATE FOR ADULTS!"
4,Neat little movie - not for children,Surprisingly good cast and script. Some great lines. Enjoyable to watch. Fighting scenes would not be appropriate for younger viewers.
4,Wonder Woman,"The hero we have all been waiting for, Wonder Woman. She is powerful and the cartoon format is maintained. Just good fun."
5,Wonder Woman,"Great movie! It was interesting & fun to see some of the backstory behind Wonder Woman's entry into ""Man's World"". I wish DC did more movies or stories about her instead of always focusing on the men."
3,1st one produced static. but sounds good,"bought this for a modest step up in vocal tracks for home recording on my 24 bit neo 2488.Ive been using the mxl990. mic would be great for the price if it wasnt defective. used it forabout 30 minutes before crackling and static started. had to go back to the 990 until all of thereturn and warranty is taken care of. i still recommend the mic though. it is hotter than the 990in its highs, but with good compression, power amp and eq the result is well worth the money."
4,Good Mic,"You get what you pay for with anything in most cases, but this mic is pretty high quality for only $100. It has a very clear and up front sound to it. Its great for recording vocals. Better than the MXL 2001 that I have and much better than the Blue Snowball which are both the same price."
1,Faulty Mic,Unfortunately China does not have the best quality control. This Mic does not work. Make sure that you check this mic upon arrival. There is a chance that this mic may not work. I got burned on this purchase because I didn't check if it worked when I got it right away. Hopefully you will have better luck than I did.
5,looks amazing,It arrived in amzing condition and i am currently using it for my podcasts. Love the vintage look and varity of uses.
5,Best Microphone Ive bought.,it cam in the mail kind of late but it was worth the wait. it has good weight to it. it sounds very clear.And its at a low price
1,Might be a good mic but...,Unfortunately I haven't been able to use it. The company shipped either a mismanufactured or flat out wrong mic clip. They finally responded with them being out of stock go talk to amazon. Uhhhggg. I bought a shock mount. If that shows up functional and as advertised I will let you know about the actual mic. I don't mean to take out my frustration with the vendor on the product.
2,the most dissapointing movie I have seen,"to start off, I love the musicians involved with this movie. they are all really creative and I love the material. Sadly enough none of them can act, and who ever wrote this wrote a better 60 synopsis for the trailer, than the whole movie.then there are the the messed up sex scenes with clay. i have never beeen skiddish about that sort of stuff, but sitting there watchiong a piece of cley shoved into a clay vagina for 5 minutes made me feel dirty or something.not what I thoughtt, great idea though"
3,great film shame it didn't work on the dvd,"the film was fantastic, and my brother who I bought it for loved, but because I live in the UK, it wouldn't work on my DVD player (wrong regional code), so we've had to alter a laptop so we can watch it on there which I wish I'd have been warned about.But again great film!"
1,Worst movie ever,"I don't care how punk rock this film is. I love punk and I'm a fan of Tim Armstrong and AFI. However, this film is the worst thing I've ever paid to see. I was at the San Francisco premiere and it was nice meeting everyone involved in the movie. When it came to watching the movie itself, I was completely disappointed. I like indie films, stupid humor, and the concept of DIY as much as the next person. However, this film was just done in such poor taste. The editing is terrible. The story is hard to follow. There's almost nothing I like about the movie. The only real funny part is hearing Davey Havok of A.F.I. be the voice of the gay hairstylist. Other than that, I wouldn't recommend that anyone buy this. Try to borrow it from someone else if you can help it. It's not worth $21.99. To be honest, I'd give it less than 1 star if I could but that's the lowest that the rating will go."
2,"Not for everyone. In fact, not for very many people at all.","This movie is only for people who have so many cult-classics, that they need something new.When a work of art shocks with the intention of teaching a lesson, it can shine. When it shocks with the intention of shocking, it loses all artisic value. The majority of the shock in Live Freaky, Die Freaky is just there to shock.I did give it two stars though, so I have to justify that. I think that the premise of this movie was a good starting point for what could have been a brilliant, if not corny and bloody cult classic. It just didn't deliver.There are a few people who will enjoy the movie. I'm not critisizing them. They will enjoy it for the punk voices (that's what had me interested), and the silliness. There's nothing wrong with that."
4,live freaky die freaky makes me go a big rubbery one,this movie is the best claymation movie i've ever seen if you like the show robot chicken you'll love this
4,really freaky,its like ruldolph the red nose reindeer on crack it's messed up not to bad but not that good if you like really weird movies go for it will be a cult classic I'll give it a B-rating
3,live freaky die freaky,"the 3 stars i gave this film were for billie joe's voicework.the film itself isnt anything you can watch more than once, not because it's too weird or anything, but simply because the editing job is absolutely terrible.the film is a great concept, but it just drags along because of some poor voiceovers and the choppy editing.considering this took like four years to finish, john roecker could have definately done better.billie joe, however, does a great job, and the behind the scenes feature on his night of recording lines was a real plus.if his name wasn't attached, you probably wouldn't know it was him. i don't recognize him at first, and that's coming from a long-time fan of his bands.all in all, its worth a watch once, but borrow it from someone before deciding to purchase it."
4,freaky & funny,"i wasn't sure what to expect, the video was a little strange at first but it was funny and i liked a different band members who did the voices!"
1,made for retarded teenage punks,"Okay, first off the bat, I saw an article on this and I couldn't wait to see it. A guy in the future finds a copy of Helter Skelter and thinks that Charlie ""Hanson"" is the messiah? Funny s**t right? And then the rest of it in clay-mation? Right On! Then I see it and reality sets in. The clay-mation is terrible. The worst quality ever seen. Those old holiday specials are better than this. The voices are dubbed horribly, and most of the voices are more annoying than children doing a school project. The script is bad, flat out bad. Every line is meant to sound vile and obscene, and make the characters saying them sound stupid. But really... they just sound stupid. Being obscene for the sake of being obscene is nothing more than a kid learning how to curse and getting it wrong.Huge dissapointment. You want to see/hear offensive and politically incorrect? Try Aristocrats or Jesus is Magic."
5,It Works.,"I bought this book many years ago when I was a college student looking for answers. I must admit, I was drawn in by the ""Made Easy"" part of the title. Well, words can never describe the effect this book has had on my life. It opened the door to the world of God and miracles. Thanks Jack."
4,"Interesting, Different, Well worth the read","This book is absolutely not what I envisioned when I ordered it.So I was wrong. Happily wrong. This book is full of surprises. It takes a fresh, unique look at a subject swamped with archaic mumbo-jumbo."
2,[...]!,"[...] I stuck with the book to the bitter end at which time I threw it away. If you are college age or younger you may find some new ideas here. If you are looking for some sort of cohesive set of ideas or a way of getting ""from here to there"" with any magical act you will be disappointed. In fact, if you are looking for a decent definition of ""memetics"" you will be disappointed. This book rambles and in the end, sadly says nothing. I will say though that I am 45 years old and have read a lot all of my life, if you are young your experience with this book may differ. What will not differ is the incoherent presentation of an unrelated set of tired ideas."
4,Great Ideas,"Very unusual and definitely will effect your views on magic and how it can be done. It is mostly geared towards writers, artists or people capable of putting things into public view. He gives you the means to create mental ""viruses"" which infect the minds of others and change brain programming. Very useful if you have a way to diseminate work into a public forum.It is also useful as a means of seeing how people get programmed and offers a way to get a measure of your mind un-programmed as well as giving you the chance of what you will re-program your mind with."
2,rather don't buy it,"I've bought it here and I don't have it for a long time, but already now I see many bad features which I don't like. batery is very bad-about 4 hours of listening and eventhough I have model without wifi.Playing only mp3,m4p and that's all. believe us with a lower rate."
2,sansa and yahoo,"do not buy this product(the sandisk sansa connect)for yahoo discontinued its music subsciption service in mid 2008,the wireless part was discontined for this product,only accessable by pc. what a waste of time and money."
1,DO NOT BUY Sansa Connect,Please do yourself a favor and DO NOT BUY this product. It does not work properly. It will not sync with Windows Media Player. The Yahoo! internet radio will not work after Summer 2008 because Yahoo! has pulled their contract. It is a rather useless device.
4,Good but NO WiFi,"Bought this for my son and it works well with Rhapsody-to-Go which is a fantastic service and has/is absorbing Yahoo Music. Only works with a USB and not via WiFi and understand from Rhapsody that there are no plans to add WiFi. (Only WiFi player is the expensive Haier Ibiza) Nevertheless for the (discounted) price it is worth it. (Sandisk website says it has ben ""discontinued"")"
1,Don't buy! Yahoo Music is shutting down!,"This device is tied to Yahoo Music, and Yahoo music is shutting down, so this thing is worthless. Buy an iPod."
4,MP3 Player,Given to my daughter who understands electronics (unlike myself). She is very pleased with the item. Says worth more than I paid for it. Plays well and sound is very clear. Controls easy to use.
4,Be careful!!,"Hi, the player work perfect, music easy to transpose, and good quality sound, but if you're buying fot he Wi-Fi, dont botter, Sandisk/Sansa, took away this feature, and here on amazon, still assure that it has Wi-Fi. Be careful."
3,Almost a great device,"The Sansa Connect was ""almost"" a great device. It is okay, has a decent UI. The Wifi options are a bit tough because you need accounts for them with the services.I would have liked wifi sync and direct podcast support. It would have been so easy to include.So, neat concept, pretty good device -- no major complaints other than it falls short of what it could have been.And, it looks like the line is steering away from wifi-enabled devices. I'm disappointed."
1,Dissappointing Tech support,"I bought this device about 3 months ago. Since then, the built-in speaker stopped working, and I have sound to the earphones on one channel only. I tried to contact tech support, but so far unsuccessful: The website provides a number to call, but it always says that ""all circuits are busy"". I also sent an email, but no response. Unless they improve their support I cannot recommend these devices."
2,Below expectations,"This devices has failed to meet my expectations.It looks like developers of this player think that have know better then me how do I want to listen my music. To start with it will work only Windows machine, moreover they force you to install Yahoo software on you computer.Unfortunately this soft is full of bugs and constantly crashes, that drives me crazy.There is not reason why they can't just allow to connect this player to the USB port and copy over all folders together with on move of a mose. No! You need to install Yahoo ""Junk boox"", then copy folder by folder from your computer to ""Junk box"", then copy folder by folder from one window of this program to another.Generally I am very disappointed and I am returning it"
1,Could have been the Killer MP3 Player of 2008!,"Why Sansa tied this product to Yahoo is beyond me. If they had made this player generic so it play through any WiFi connection, it would have made it the best MP3 Player on the market. I have been looking for a Wireless MP3 Player that I can connect to my stereo systems (house, car, boat) and play whatever songs I have on it. Can you imagine if you could do that and download songs wirelessly from your PC, Notebook!"
1,Very poor product,"I bought this during thanksgiving day sale. I loved the fact that this player has Wi-Fi and expandable, using the microSD slot. But none that matters if the player never goes off! Yes, for whatever reasons, after a couple of on/off, downloading a song or two, the player would not power off, it got stuck in the welcome screen. Since it does not have a detacheable battery, I had no choice but to return the item to Amazon. Wish Sandisk had paid more attention to product quality."
2,"No support for wireless ""N"" yet","Was purchased primarily for wi-fi found out it will not work with ""N"" but should work with the older versions...... so I wait...support was excelent!"
2,Hardware Problems,"First let me say that overall, this is not a bad mp3 player. The internet radio is a great feature (especially when you aren't willing to pay for premium services like satellite radio). The menu transitions seemed to lag a bit, but that could be resolved with future firmware updates.However, I rated this for two stars because of unreliable hardware. The first one I had would overheat and shutdown when it was playing and charging with a car adapter. After a days use it also started to turn itself on everytime the player was plugged in and lock up before it finished loading. If I plugged in the player while playing music, it would also lock up.I sent that back for a replacement, which had a nonfunctional volumn down button. If you really need WiFi capabilites, wait for something better to come along."
1,Don't buy this product it wont work after July,"Let me first say, I actually really like the Sansa Connect. I bought one about a month ago for use with the Yahoo Music Service and have really been liking it. I am giving this a 1 review simply because this product will become obsolete in a few months. All of the features using Yahoo Music will just go away when you are forced to transition to Rhapsody. Basically you will be left with an overpriced underpowered MP3 player with a wireless connection you cant do anything with. Do not purchase this product!!!!!"
3,"It stores, it plays.","This unit is great if you have access to WIFI all the time. I bought it to compliment my old Sansa E-260, which still works! I like the Yahoo music it streams, but unless you pay for the premium access the music starts to turn into re-runs, and can get old. I say it's okay because the sound is good, but not as great as other top line players. I use it mainly as an extreme elements, or work out player to keep from breaking my other expensive players. The Sansa's are pretty tough, and i like the ability to share music files with my other computers."
3,Yahoo Service to be discontinued,"FYI...Ive just learned that the Yahoo To Go service that is built into this device will be discontinued by Yahoo ""Mid 2008"". Other services like Rhapsody will stll be available but I believe you will need to connect to your PC via the USB instead of utilizing this items built in WiFi"
1,HP 38 ink cartridge,"Beware-just opened this cartridge to install (was not needed until now) and discovered that it arrived more than two years past its expiration date. HP excludes all warranties and service if installed out of date. I have written back to the vendor, but past my return window (let's see what their response will be). Suggest opening package on arrival to confirm expiration dates, then resealing in plastic bag. This product was mis-represented by the vendor and deserves no stars."
4,Great INK for your HP,"Pricey ink, but the cartridges produce vivid colors that LAST.And I have to admit, the cartridges to last a while compared to other brands I've used.All in all, I am please with it."
2,Really bad sound,"People will try and say that this recording comes in all of its mono (audio) glory, or something along those lines however, it's just plain bad audio recording and I was quite surprised they (Koch) didn't clean it up. Get all his other ""Little Darling"" recordings on Koch but skip this one. More frustrating than anything else."
1,Take This Poor Quality Recording And Shove It,"Terrible non-re-engineering; audio cut-outs; weird ""stereo"" pans; disorienting. Not worth it even for collectors and Paycheck devotees. The individual ""preview"" tracks don't show the flaws so I bought this with the expectation that I was going to get some rare gems instead of slop."
1,Instant disaster!,"I am a major Craig Sheffer fan. I have seen all his films and enjoyed them all...except for this one! I hate to say it, but it's pretty pathetic. It is the story of a filmmaker(Sheffer), the starlet he falls for(Chelsea Noble), and a spoiled actor(David Cassidy). After that point, I am not really sure what the movie is about at all! It does have a few funny moments, but on the whole not enough to make it worth the effort. Even Sheffer's acting ability could not salvage it. If you really need to see this film, wait for it to come on cable, or try and rent it. Otherwise, see one of Sheffer's numerous other films, there isn't a disappointment in the bunch."
3,Assembly nightmare.,Quality of the product is good for the price. Overall value is quite good. My only real complaint is the assembly required. The details of the item should indicate that total assembly is required. It took six hours for me to complete assembly and the instructions leave a great deal to be desired.
5,This closet cooler rocks,"I'm using this closet cooler in my media closet and it works very well. I was somewhat skeptical so I bought a thermometer/humidity sensor and put it in the closet first. I took readings for 7 days and then installed the closet cooler and took readings for an additional 7 days. I noticed a 15 degree drop in temperature and a 10 % drop in humidity. I highly recommend this product as it is a good way to reduce the overall heat and humidity in your media closet. The installation was what I expected, took a little bit of time but I wanted to make sure that I did the install right the first time."
4,You will look like a Heidi-ho in this outfit,"I bought this costume for an Oktoberfest party and had such a blast wearing it!It's a very cute costume and the fit was fine too. The little hearts are adorable. I bought a medium, which is generally the size I wear, and it fit fine. The only issue was it was incredibly short! But I'm pretty tall.It does come with a built in petticoat which is great. I actually wore another longer petticoat with my costume just to give me a little more coverage on my ba-donk-a-donk so I didn't show too much off if I needed to bend down.The material is a little stiff but not uncomfortable. All in all, it's a good purchase."
4,"An Oldie, but a Goodie","A very informative book, it's as timely now as when it was first published in 1968. In fact, may of the miracle cures which were touted in those days, and Mr. Perkinson handily dispatched in his book, are even more glaring in their inadequacy today."
5,Mouthpiece protector should be decorated,"I bought this for my son's Tuba Mouthpiece. He bought the mouthpiece himself for over $100, so he tries to take care of it, but he has still managed to drop it. The cover works great. He wasn't sure what the wing on it was for, so he decided to use it as an over large beak for a penguin. Painted as a Penguin, it doesn't get confused with others."
2,I was very dissapointed with this book!,"I wish that I had not even bought this book! Probably half of the free things in this book were free catalogs, and lots of them were just free hotlines! I definitely advise you not to waste your money on this book, unless you would like to find out about a bunch of catalogs that you can get for free, shouldn't all catalogs be free! I was very dissapointed with this book!"
2,Sub-Par Sound of Good Songs,"The sound is tinny and appears to come from inferior masters for all of the songs. If sound quality is of little importance to you, then the price may be right for you. Otherwise, buy these songs from a better label, like Rhino. My advice is to pass on this one."
2,"if u like strategic games, DO NOT get this game!!",i was sick and i played Open Season and i played (for 4 hours) and i beat it.Here's what i think:it is WAY too easy to taunt & scare hunters.i like games where you can explore and maybe find bonus points or new abilities.That is NOT that kind of game!!!
4,Fuuuuuuuuuunnnnnnnn!,"This game is great!I rented it from Hollywood video and it was worth it!If you are roaring at one hunter separately from others it is soooooo easy,but fun.However more then one hunter can be tough to beat but most hunters run when you sneak up and roar at them.Exept bear hunters and sometimes Shaw,the hunters run when you roar at them.You can play as Boog(the bear)and Elliot(the deer).Although it only took me 2 days to finish all 30 levels,it was so much fun.There are mini games you can unlock and upgrades you can get at""The Academy"".You can also throw Elliot where ever you like most of the time(even of cliffs)and all you have to do is call him back and he will come back.The thing I don't like about this game is sometimes when you are playing as Elliot,the hunters do a victory dance which I don't like.Besides that,this is a great game!"
1,"Sorry, so sad, but it doesn't work!","I was thrilled with this pedometer and wore it every day. Found that it added steps while driving, not wearing it in the car corrected that. After 3 weeks, it stopped working -- counted 2 steps one day, 5 the next. Changed battery and now I just have 00000 regardless! What a waste!"
2,Sportline not very reliable,"I managed to get about 50 days out of one of these before it died. By then the hinge was broken. I have also returned two to the store-one never worked, the other fell apart in a day."
1,Unreliable,"Does not work reliably. If you are looking for a pedometer, there are better ones out there, such as the Omron HJ-112, that do the job they are supposed to do."
1,Battery replacement challenge,"If the complaints about inaccuracy don't dissuade you, let me add another reason to reject this product. Battery replacement is enough of a hassle that you may want to smash the device to smithereens.A company is short-sighted to market a shoddy product. People tend to reject everything a company makes once they've had a bad experience. If I'm looking for a $100 heart rate watch, I'm sure not going to consider any products by Sportline."
1,Unreliable,"I wanted something simple. No calorie counters, no timers, no built in radio...just count my steps. The design of this product does exactly that, but not accurately. In one session, I can walk around the house, count my steps, check the counter and its pretty close. I can then go for a mile walk and it registers 600 steps (meaning each stride was roughly 9 ft...sorry, not possible). Upon taking some very long walks over several days and placing the device in different spots, I have not ever come close to the count I should have gotten...so I am very disappointed in the product and will be returning it. For the one thing it was supposed to do, it just doesn't do it's job."
1,Useless,"I also wanted just a basic ""count the steps"" type pedometer, so I bought one of these recently. It has proved to be totally useless as it will reset itself to 0 steps at seemingly random intervals. This makes my ""total"" for the day meaningless. Apparently only very light pressure is required on the reset button to activate it..."
3,Good product for the price,"These pedometers work well but not amazingly accurate. Though, I'm not sure how pedometers can get extremely accurate.Purchased about 30 of these for a work program. About 10 people came back with broken pedometers (ex. screens were faded or stopped counting steps altogether).It's a good start to see an estimate of how many steps you take throughout the day."
1,not for real money,I have had 3 330 units and now a 340 was given to me. The 330 Model was somewhat good but the Model 340 is a loser. Buy other's not Sportline.
1,didn't work at all!,"I purchased this pedometer because I didn't really want to spend much money, but I should have known better. With every step, there was clicking/ticking sounds which drove me nuts so I wouldn't wear it while walking around the office. It also didn't accurately count steps for me. I programed the stride length, per instructions and then tried to test the count. Sometimes 10 steps = 35 and other times only 4 or 5 steps. Plain and simple, it simply didn't work at all. I returned this and spent the extra cash on an Omron which worked beautifully! Was quiet, accurate, and simple to use."
3,Loved it......but it didn't last long!!!,"Basic pedometer which was pretty accurate. Wore it almost every day for a month, and it really encouraged me to be more active. Unfortunately I dropped it on to soft carpeted flooring and it no longer works! Should be a little bit sturdier, particularly as most people wear pedometers when working out."
1,Waste of Money,I wore the pedometer for two days during the same extended walk. The results were no where similar. Day three it stopped dead and hasn't worked since.
1,Disappointing! DON'T BUY THIS!,"Well, I wanted a simple pedometer. This is so simple that it doesn't work well at all. No bells, no whistles, no reliablilty. A couple friends also bought one, they are equally disappointed. I got what I paid for. It wa so inexpensive that it is not worth returning. It claims to self adjust for your steps. It doesn't seem to. I have tested it for 200 steps on 7 occassions and the steps ranged from 105 to 180. So, if you are on a 10,000 step program, you'll end up walking at least 12,000 which I guess is good. I also wear it biking as it counts ""pumps"" of the leg. Sometimes. Today O biked for 36 minutes and it came up with 174. Yesterday 24 minutes and 5027 was recorded. I have been vary careful to place it on my belt line at the place indicated to no avail."
2,You get your money's worth,"One day, I walk 12,000 + steps and the next day, I walk 5,000 steps -- SAME DISTANCE!! I walk to and from work and I don't know which to believe. Somewhere in the middle?Completely erratic counting: no rhyme or reason."
1,Totally Erratic,"I would definitely go with something else if you want a pedometer that actually counts your steps. Sometimes it seems to count about 1/3 of my steps, and sometimes closer to half. If it were consistent, capable of any precision at all, it would be usable. But since there's no way to accurately guess the number of steps walked based on the pedometer's count, it's essentially useless.I've tried counting my steps and then reading the meter, and I've tried walking known distances and then checking the count, and there's no consistency. I can walk the same course on consecutive days and this pedometer thinks I've gone 50% farther the second day as the first.I think the reviewer who commented that it's too cheap to bother to send back is on to something: Sportline can sell junk, and if it's not sold in a brick and mortar store, no one will bother to return it, and they profit."
1,not worth your money,"I've had 2 of these and while one was accurate for 3 days, the 2nd one I got in exchange for the first was doing the job for only 2 days.. even at a discounted price, it's not worth your time and money. Buy a more durable and reliable pedometer!"
3,pedometer,"Its ok low end pedometer. Doesnt give accurate readiug for the same distance walk but its still a point of reference.Not bad, not great"
1,Save your money,"I bought this pedometer yesterday because I wanted to try to walk 10,000 steps a day. It recorded false steps when I was driving, and then stopped recording real steps when I was half-way through a two-mile walk. At one point yesterday, it reset itself back to zero. What a disappointment!"
2,"Poor book, considering who wrote it.","I generally liked this book. It was well-written and is a very quick read.However, I do have some complaints. There are no footnotes on where the author found her quotes, only a thin bibliography of the author's sources. The last chapter on Alexandra Of Denmark and her sister Dagmar is, by far, the weakest chapter. It should have been titled ""Alexandra"", for it barely has anything on Princess Dagmar and her influence on Russia. She also gets her geneology mixed up.If you find this book at the library then I encourage you to pick it up and read it. Otherwise, don't waste your time or money in searching for this out-of-print book.The best thing that I can say of this book is that it will get you interested in its subjects. If you do wish to read more about royal subjects, then go to Frasers."
4,Pleasing vignettes,"I think that some of the reviewers have been a bit harsh on HRH and that she's presented a likeable, gossipy view of the temperaments and times of the ladies about whom she's written. I don't believe that she ever intended to give an in depth, political overview of the royal consorts...far from it! Even though one reviewer called it a ""lightweight"" book, I believe that it was the personal side of these women that the author wished to show, not their effect on the country's politics. Personally, I loved hearing about the fashions, customs and foibles of these princesses from past times and also loved to hear about their relationships with their husbands, children and families. So, it's all irrelevant to the workings of the various countries but, so what..it's an entertaining collage of personal facts about well known women and I for one, thoroughly enjoyed it!"
4,The Tahoe spray,"The spray is interesting in a way, it smells close to the AXE line but t has a certain distinct smell that is unique from the other cheap WALMART brands"
3,Misled,"Yep, the canopy is decent and easy to set up. I did it by myself in 1-1/2 hours. The ad on Amazon is totally misleading, though. The ad shows a picture of canopy and walls, but instead you must buy the walls seperately. Save yourself some $$ and go to PepBoys. It's less expensive for both walls and canopy, has a rebate offer and you save a bundle on shipping."
3,Wrong footed,"Unlike the image, the enclosure comes WITHOUT a top. To learn this at hindsight, was very disappointing. It's a pity because the material is O.K."
1,no FRAME,"Hello Amazon, thanks for the opportunity to evaluate my purchase. When I found the product on site, showed that the product was a garage full of car, which was what I was looking for and made the purchase when I received the product I realized I bought the canvas without the metal frame as shown in the box. So I'm decepicionado with the purchase and felt aggrieved."
5,Over fifty 'ecoshamanistic' practices from ceremonies to rituals and point the way to a lifestyle which supports these practices,"James Endredy's Ecoshamanism: Sacred Practices Of Unity Power & Earth Healing is for any who have wondered what shamanism is. Earth Education is here explained as a spiritual offshoot of environmentalism, and Shamanism blends spiritual perceptions with understanding of nature's cycles and connections between spirituality and the earth. Chapters do more than provide a philosophical and spiritual overview: they include over fifty 'ecoshamanistic' practices from ceremonies to rituals and point the way to a lifestyle which supports these practices."
5,"If you can find this CD, buy it!","First, a correction; the artist's name is actually WON Il. I came across my copy in a used CD store, and I'm so glad I picked it up.I don't know a whole lot about him, but according to the liner notes, ""Won Il is known as a Korean traditional musician to the public. Yes, he is a Korean traditional drummer, Piri (Korean flute) player and composer. But these are not enough to explain him."" Well, they certainly aren't. ""Asura"" features an extraordinary combination of instruments including electric guitar, djembe, Irish pipes, accordion, cello, and practically every kind of traditional and modern percussion you can think of. Some of the cuts are lively and jazzy, others are very sad and wistful, but they're all beautifully done and musically sophisticated. When I play this on my radio program I inevitably get listeners wanting to know what it is."
5,Gorgeous watch (Perpetual Calendar Watch #SNQ010),"I purchased this watch for my hubby for Christmas through an Amazon Marketplace vendor. I was impressed with the watch just seeing it online, but the blue face is even more gorgeous on my hubby's arm. The picture online doesn't do it justice, but another customer had photographed the watch on his own arm, which gave me a better idea of how nice a gift it would be. I am very pleased with this purchase, and my husband likes it very much."
1,Arrived broken...,"As soon as I got this, and was setting the time, one of the ""push buttons"" on the side popped off on to the floor, and it would not stay on the watch any longer. Extremely frustrating experience. Returned it and purchased a a no frills Timex that was easy to set time and date and haven't had a problem with it at 1/3 the price. I would not recommend recommend this product."
1,Replacing the battery costs $75!!!!!,"Do not buy this watch! No jeweler will replace the battery. Only Seiko will replace the battery. They charge $50-$75 to do so, and you have to ship it. That is why they are on a clearance sale. My battery lasted about 3-4 years. Whey you have to pay this much to replace a battery every 3-4 years, the watch is not worth it. In fact, at $99.99 it would have been smarter to throw away the watch and buy a new one rathter than replace the batter. Don't buy it, buy another brand."
1,Quality??,"I bought this watch in 2006,and it was my first Seiko in years. I figured I'd buy one good watch which will last years. How wrong I was. This watch is garbage. First the band broke and I found out that a replacement band is $75.00. Then the calendar displayed the date between the numbers. (Example: Bottom half of 14 and the top half of 15). Yesterday I took the watch into the jeweler to get a new battery. I tried to reset the calendar and the stem came out of the watch. After numerous attempts to put it back in, I went back to the jeweler. He was able to get the stem to stay, however, he said that I shouldn't try and reset the date, because the watch places the stem in neutral and will fall out again. I've owned a lot of watches over the years and it amazes me that my Casio watches, even the $20.00 one, works great and a watch I payed more than $150.00 for is broken. Never again."
1,Poor Quality,"After wearing this just a couple months, the watch would intermittently lose up to an hour every other few weeks. Be very concerned about the quality of this watch."
5,It's all here!,This new edition appears to answer practically all the questions that might be raised by the home/farm electrician who wants to follow updated Code requirements. Clear explanations are accompanied by useful diagrams.
5,perfect find,"Seriously, selling for 70$ at Barnes and Noble? I almost shot out a dozen eggs when I found it this cheap on Amazon.Thank You!!!"
5,Neice of a friend of Sonny Calhau,I read this book at my moms. We always try to keep up with anything and anyone that knew John Kennawell. It was a blessing to see that Michael had a picture of Sonny and my Uncle Johnny together. I will always remember that picture and know my mother has it. Someday I will have that same picture. Also I was glad that he put letters from mothers and others in this touching book.
4,Creative genius with color pictures!,"I have owned this book ( I hope it's the same one! ) since 1986. The pub date on this book says 1984, so the one you're reading about may be different....?Having grown up listening to the music of Yes, and staring with fascination at the jacket art, this book was literally snatched up as soon as I saw it!These two brothers are so creative and talented together as well a indivdually that I found it hard to read the text, rather that just look at the pictures!This is definately a must have ""coffee table book""!"
1,STAY FAR FAR AWAY,"I stumbled upon this collection at a flea market for $3. I feel like they should have paid me to take it off their hands! The frst indication that something was a-miss was the inclusion of The Dell's Oh What A Night. That is certainly not a disco song. I was attracted to it for the Eddie Floyd Knock On Wood (1990 Radio Re-Mix) and that is about the only song on the CD that is not painful to listen to. All the other tracks are horrid re-recordings by one or more members of the original group, so the liner notes say. The ""In The Navy"" version by The Village People is almost laughable as it's so bad. Stay Far Far Away from this CD."
1,False advertising -- not Kenmore brand,"I ordered this filter since it is advertised as a ""Kenmore"" product. The item that arrived was definitely not made by Kenmore and had a strange scent. Since I buy HEPA filters due to bad allergies the last thing I want is a scented filter. Do not purchase if you are looking for a brand-name, quality filter."
5,Vacuum Filters,Works fine and fits well at a fraction of the cost of the manufacturers replacement item. I highly recommend this item.
5,Kenmore Hepa Fitler #86889,Price was right and ordering is convenient. I will continue to purchase this product on line. yada yada yada yada
5,Just what we needed,Just what we needed to replace the dirty filter in our vacuum. I like the price too. . . .
5,replacement filter,as good as Sears and much cheaper they fit well and performed as well as the name brand if you want to save money by them here
5,Kenmore vacuum cleaner filters,"Great value, much cheaper than stores, fits great, works great! It is a nice way to freshen up a stinky vacuum cleaner"
4,finally received the entire order,"I placed the order of the filters for my sister and was waiting until she was satisfied before writing the review. The title says ""2 Kenmore Hepa Filter"" but only 1 filter per package arrived (ordered 3 pkgs). After several phone calls and a couple of weeks, the missing filters were finally received. Thank you."
4,Seems to work fine,Have only vacuumes a couple of times with the new filter. It seems to perform the same as the name-brand Kenmore product
4,Kenmore Hepa Filter,Filter is very close to the Sears Hepa filter. Fits the vacuum perfectly. This filter is quite a bit cheaper than the Sears product and their all made in China.
5,KENMORE HEPA FILTERS,THESE FILTERS ARE QUALITY FILTERS JUST LIKE THE VACUME BAGS & THE PRICE IS GREAT COMPARED TO SEARS & OTHER OFF BRAND FILTERS.
5,Value-priced alternative to Kenmore branded filters,"Seems to fit and work just as well as the Kenmore branded filters. I should point out, however, that my family has no asthmatic or allergic members, so I can't speak to air quality resulting from the filtration."
5,Great show that wasn't given time to find its audience.,"Great show that wasn't given time to find its audience. I thought building on the full length feature film was a great idea. They even feature a lot of similarities which tied in great for anyone who liked the movie. Ben Rappaport played the part of ""Mr Toad"" really well."
1,Thank you NBC for coming to your senses and cancelling this show.,"There is nothing fun or funny about outsourcing American jobs. I am open-minded, but to debut and continue to air this show during the worst bout of unemployment and poverty in my lifetime felt like a slap in the face."
5,"Highly enjoyable, even if a bit predictable and crude","This is a great show. Though after about half way through it, the show gets very sexual. If you can get by that, the show is still amazing with witty humor that will make almost anyone laugh. Some of the jokes do not translate well into the Indian culture, though it's awesome to see a tv show try it out. Many plot points can be figured out in the long run, but the jokes make me keep coming back, rewind and laugh again."
2,"You are better off getting the book specific to Excel, Word, etc.","This book is too general trying to crunch very basic how-to for the entire MS Office Suite. You will find better content and tips by purchasing each book that specializes each application separately (e.g., Teach Yourself Visually Excel, Teach Yourself Visually Word, Teach Yourself Visually Outlook, etc.)"
4,Teach Yourself Visually Microsoft Office 2007,Very informative. Good for new or experienced Office users. Recommend to help get started on Office 2007 as there are several updates in this edition. Handy to be able to refer to a book and it will walk you thru it step by step.
2,"It is just ""okay"".","I purchased this book as a way to help me get up to speed on Office 2007. I am not that computer savvy and I lost out on a job because of my poor computer skills. I thought this book might help with excel, power point, etc. It was too simplified in some respects. I found that I needed a lot more instruction than I was getting from this generalized book. I did like the visual style. I believe, it would have been better if I had purchased each manual separately rather than in one book like the Office 2007. For instance, I needed to brush up on ""excel"" so should have bought a book just for ""excel""."
5,great book,this book helped me with my college papers and I am glad that I purchased it.A nd I would let people know that this product is worth the money.
4,Great Gift For Undertaker,"Found this used, when looking for a gift for my father-in-law, who is a mortician. He really liked it, and I found it interesting as well. I only wish some photos were in color."
3,Disappointed little girl!,This child's flip phone is fine in all respects but one! It is advertized as being yellow. In fact the soft bag that holds the phone IS yellow but the phone itself is pink. This probably will not be a factor for most children but my granddaughter had been asking consistently for a YELLOW princess flip phone. She was very disappointed to discover that this phone is indeed pink!!!!
1,"out of the frying pan, into the fire","This book is the story of a Roman Catholic priest who left his ""church"". Before becoming a Christian, I was in the ""Church"" of Rome too, for over twenty years, so I was very excited to read the author's motives.Unfortunately, the author left one cult to enter another. Instead of challenging the Catholic ""church"" for its many heresies and blatant idolatry, Davis criticizes the church's ""outdated views"" and unwillingness to accept destructive higher criticism, which is a heresy every bit as bad as Catholic doctrine."
3,PLEIKU,"Not a bad book - I guess I was just expecting something different. I bought this after reading ""We Were Soldiers"" and hoped it would read the same. If you're looking for a Vietnam book, or a book about the beginning of the air cav, I recomend getting ""We Were Soldiers"" instead."
4,Good for training,"Decent quality leather for the price. Nice snap ends. Fit my Morgan nicely, definitely a value for the money. Chin strap a little short."
5,Small's whimsical pictures are perfectly suited to Sandburg,"This book is a satisfying follow-up to David Small's last twobooks, The Gardener & The Library. Though this is an old story its optimistic message suits Small's whimsical style beautifully. I'm thoroughly confused by the review in Kirkus that criticizes the repetitive nature of the names--this is part of Sandburg's poetic form--as well as the ""pointless"" nature of the Huckabuck family's travels, which is actually the whole point of the story. One must take a change in luck in stride, go out and find one's new fortune, and you may even find yourself back home having learned a thing or two. Cheers (& 5 stars) to the Huckabucks, Sandburg, and David Small."
5,One of the best!,"When my mom read this book to my sister and me, it had already entertained young readers for about 50 years. How lucky were we that this story had been preserved for the purpose of delighting us to the very core of our young beings? The idea of a popcorn farm catching fire was thoroughly thought provoking for an already thought-filled pre-schooler.When I recently purchased it for my own little girls, I must admit that I suffered a major disappointment. You see, the Huckabuck family has a pony faced daughter named, ""Pony Pony Huckabuck."" Unbeknownst to me (and in my honor) every single time that my mom read this book, that daughter became ""Joanie Joanie Huckabuck."" Now, I can't decide if I should be upset that Sandburg didn't really name one of his main characters for me, or that my mom re-named the ""PONY FACED"" child after me.In any case, I highly recommend this book to any parent who would like to share a very interesting story, told with interesting language, with their children."
2,Forget this one,"As a teacher who is developing an inter-disciplinary unit on popcorn, I was disappointed in this book. Spend your money on Corn Is Maize, The Popcorn Book, or even George Washington's Breakfast, all of which provide excellent background."
2,Mised my boat,"Didn't grab my interest.My rule of thumb is that if I stay bored for two or more chapters, it's not going to get any better. There are exceptions, but I'm happy with my rule."
1,Waste of money,"Parrot EASY-DRIVE auto Bluetooth adapter. Although not mentioned in the web site that I purchased it from, the product is no longer in production, and for a very good reason......it's junk. Paired up with cell phone OK, but the echoing and fade are so bad that it's next to impossible to communicate using it."
4,No tickets when on the phone,"It works great, people hear you and you hear them just like talking on a handset."
4,Billy Crawford - Big City,"I have been listening to this CD for a about three months and I really like it. This cd finds Billy trying to merge into a more R&B sound than his last disc, but the change seems very normal the first song I really feel in love with was ""GO Go"" which is a bonus track featuring Kelli from Liberty X it's a nice club song great vocals and production. Next was the song ""Magazine"" which would be a great single for america very u.s. sounding again great production and then a very nice ballad called ""the Jump off"" it has a kinda Justin timberlake/usher falsetto part to it that is amazing, and then the singles are featured here as well ""bright lights"" and ""Steamy Nights"" both have a R Kelly fiesta Remix sound to them although they were released first I think there are a lot better songs on the actual disc, and I don't know what the label was thinking. Overall it's a excellent disc filled with great performaces and Billy's wild style."
4,Very Good,"It must be good because I still can recall some of the scenes in the movie. Kristy looked mature though since her role in Duffy, the Vampire Slayer."
5,samyville,Live in the area of Sammyville. Enjoyed watching to see where each of the scenes were shot. A rather true to life story line of what I know of Sammy.
4,Fan of the Chase,"I have been waiting for this one to come out, and I am glad it did. I am more of sci-fi fan but Chase looks hot!! The story line will keep you guessing too. Its a must have for Chase fans! and fans of suspense.chuck2001"
3,Sierra Nevada Wildflowers,"I think this is a pretty good book for beginners, but for more advanced flower identification, this book is not that good. First, it is organized by color variation, and not by plant family. Also, there are many species of wildflowers that occur in the sierras that do not appear in this book.As an example to illustrate how this is a weakness, imagine the following sceanrio:If you found a yellow flower that was not in the book, you would have a hard time identifying it looking in the 'yellow' section of this book, because closely related species may not be yellow.The pictures, on the other hand, are very well done. The photos are closeups, and very bright. If you want a basic book this may be the one for you.Good luck!"
5,Excellent junior level astrophysics textbook,"This is a modern text in all ways. It's a massive tome with all of the extra information one might want (as a reference) along with code for working on software-based projects integrated with the class. As an instructor, it's hard for me to picture how to make this book much better (other than a simple update including a final move away from FORTRAN). The students generally come to appreciate it after dealing with the initially daunting thickness and weight of the book.Required physics background is first year introductory physics only. Math background only of high school level calculus. Some descriptive astronomy background might be nice, but that's easy enough in self-study or with the instructor adding some material in as the class progresses."
3,Good but too lengthy,"This book covers astrophysics at the advanced undergraduate level. However, I find that it is not appropriate for use as a textbook because of its length. It simply covers too much stuff and it is very difficult jumping chapters without losing some content necessary later in the book. This therefore confuses students. It is also very expensive."
4,REMIX,I am sooo happy to add the Remix of Jesus Can Work it out to my gospel collection! It is a must have. Try it you won't be sorry! Kudos and Blessings to Dr. Charles Hayes
5,From the Board Games Editor at BellaOnline.com,"""EXTREME"" is no joke.... these puzzles range from pretty tough to cursing-the-day-you-ever-started-doing-these-darn-things tough. Sudoku purists may not enjoy the puzzles that don't fit into the traditional 9x9 grid, but any sudoku-er who considers themselves unstumpable will thoroughly enjoy these puzzles.This book makes a great gift for your favorite sudoku fiend!"
4,This books makes Sudoku even more fun,"If you like Sudoku but the puzzles seem to be getting dull, try the variants in this book. Different sizes and arrangements make new puzzles out of an old game."
4,"Good, but so very short",You'll get excellent nuggets on how these designers think. I enjoyed the dvd quite a bit for that fact. But it was disconcerting how short the segments were. Just as you were getting into what the designer was conveying the segment would end. That is a disappointment after the engrossing nature of Helvetica's designer shorts (the extras)
3,"Pretty book, pretty useful","The Knopf guide may be the most beautiful guide to Provence currently in publication. Glorious pictures, excellent graphics and a good, glossy cover make it very decorative.The contents themselves are fair - Provence is a very large area to cover and, naturally, some places get shorter-shrift than others. Where the information exists, I found it to be accurate and the reviewers' ratings usually agreed with my opinions.I'd like to see a larger guide with more detail - particularly about smaller towns (not everybody who goes to Provence remains in Avignon or Aix) but, until one comes along, this is a decent buy."
4,simple stories that really grow on you,"My son received this book set as a gift when he was about eight months old. He is now 20 months and still enjoys these books. There is nothing remarkable about them, but we have to read at least 2 out of the 4 every night before he goes to bed. Bialosky's House is his favorite. ""Bialosky couldn't decide what color to paint his house..."" All his animal friends have their favorite colors and Bialosky's house ends up with interesting results. These books are colorfully illustrated and just the right size and weight for small hands."
3,Almost perfect..,"I love Amazon and buy a lot of things here, this hammock stand was not one of them, way over priced. I paid $90 from JCPenny for mine.Very heavy and well made, box came all torn up with steel showing up.Super easy to put together. Big BUT is when you try to sit in your hammock, steel frame shakes and moves around. We will try to put the holes and put big screws and see if that helps."
3,Hammock stand lets hammock sag too close to ground,"Purchased this hammock stand in Louisville, KY, at Home Depot this week (03-20-2012) for $99. Chains would have been helpful for hanging the hammock. The stand allows the hammock to sag very close to the base - within 6"". Will experiment with fixing this issue using s-hooks and chains. Otherwise appears to be sturdy enough if one is careful getting in and out, which is usually wise to do with a hammock anyway."
3,Decent alternative to two trees....,"Assembly of the stand was a snap. I think it took me 10min without looking at the directions. The stand seems to be heavy-duty; made with heavy gauge steel, and welds looks fairly substantial.Where I subtract stars is the 'feel' of the hammock when using the stand. Whereas when hanging your hammock between two sturdy trees you only get the smooth, relaxing swing of the hammock, with this stand you feel an up-and-down bouncing motion along with the swinging motion. The stand is very long (it has to be though) which allows for flexing, giving the up-and-down motion.Optimally, two trees will give a better overall feel, but if two aren't in the right spot or the right distance apart, then this stand is a decent alternative."
1,Hammock stand collapsed do not purchase,"We purchased the Pawleys Tri-Beam textured steel hammock stand and it arrived in good condition. It was easy to assemble, but I noticed that the connector was a compressed tube. Sure enough, the second time we used it, the stand collapsed and threw us on the ground. The connector failed and one of the arms is now sticking straight up in the air. This is a defective design - do not purchase this product."
4,Presto,I ordered this letter opener because I have not been able to find one that was this heavy and worked properly with out tearing the envelopes. I open several evelopes at work and was having a hard time with the letter openers that we had. This one slides down the envelope and I don't have to worry that it will snap.
4,Voices of Rwandan survivors,"Among the many books about the Rwandan genocide, this is one of the first to give priority to the words and feelings of Rwandans. The authors spent several months in the region shortly after the massacre interviewing many survivors. John Janzen is an anthropologist, and his scholarship is thorough. But much of the book is a collection of people's stories. The drawings by children of what they witnessed is particularly haunting. While of interest to scholars, this book includes many illustrations and is easily accessible to the general reader."
2,Needs an editor!!!,"This book, for all of Peter Russell's genetic knowledge, is atrocious. This book (Fourth Edition) is full of mistakes in practice problems, answers to those problems, and in figures and general lay out. I would suggest that the publishers hire some editors to review the final draft of the new edition because for the money I spent on this text, it is not worth it."
3,Good BUT...,"I was happy with the product until I learned that Nestle was one of the companies who contracted with Senomyx to use an aborted fetus, for their taste enhancing experiements. I've been boycotting all Kraft Foods, Cadbury, Nestle, Frito-Lay, Tostitos, other Pepsi products and any other products made by companies who purchased this research using the exploitation of this aborted human being."
5,Love this coffee creamer,This is my all time favorite coffee creamer. I LOVE cinnamon and there's just enough in this to make it delicious. I just wish they'd make more flavors mixed with cinnamon. (You guys listening?)
5,Coffee Mate Cin/Vanilla,This creamer substitute is a good thing to prevent boredom from the same old taste all the time.
5,BJ Port Orchard WA,I enjoy the taste of this coffee mate and Amazon is the only place I can find it to buy.
4,Sad book,This book is very sad to read. The poor woman's depression overwhelmed her so much that she couldn't see what an exciting and lucky life she actually had. It was very informative to me what depression does to someone's mind and way of thinking. I never realized the inherent pain they suffer
4,Hilarious,"Whenever I travel in Canada I catch this show. I've been checking periodically hoping it would come out on DVD and here it is! My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that I haven't actually watched each episode. If you want something laugh out loud funny, with a sexual twist here and there, give this show a chance! And for those of you that long to spend more time in Canada than is feasible, the show may help take a little edge off the longing of wanting to be north of the border."
4,Robson Arms,With the Discovery of Corner Gas I was looking for something else new to try. This shows subject matter was a little harsh at first but I stuck with it and still interesting to watch. Not for kids at all though. The stories are very good and seem real. I have plans on buying Season Two.
4,Delightfully Quirky,"A friend who shares my same penchant for quirky Canadian videos recommended Robson Arms. I loved it! I sent for all three seasons for myself and plan to give Season One as a Christmas stocking stuffer gift to my son.I must be jaded. I say this because I was constantly caught off-guard by the plot developments in this series. I loved the loony collection of residents, each with their own foibles, whose antics and idiosyncracies often elicited a guffaw of surprised delight.While it's true there's salty language, and both adult situations and sight-gags, it's somehow not offensive. While this is not a series a child should view, it's not something a child would be interested in because it's mostly over their heads.I watched Season One with a smile. Season Two has less of a smile factor, but it's necessary to understand Season Three, whose smile factor is right back up to par with Season One.The real tragedy is that this clever series ended at all."
3,The Roots of the series,"Season 2 is better than season 1, But season one has some great shows,but not all. It took season 2 to see the plots and cast develope into good shows week after week,More adult themes here than found in Corner Gas. Hank and Lacey(C.G.) are regular guests in Robson Arms,Brent & Wanda (C.G.) appear together in one episode."
1,Not worth it,"Robson Arms: The Complete First SeasonFirst heard of this because I am a fan of CORNER GAS series -- several actors are in both series. UNFORTUNATELY this series is NOT Corner Gas -- not really funny ""funny"" and defintely NOT for ""family (children)"" viewing. Was a different view of actors who are in both series but SORRY I PURCHASED --"
5,Megan Follows was great in this show !!!!!,Megan Follows was great in this show. I think this is one of the besttv shows she ever guest stared in ever.
3,Good survey book,"The profiles are not especially deep but they cover lots of artists, including some seldom reviewed elsewhere."
1,Dangerous yoga block,"This block is hollow inside and can easily break under some weight. I got my wrist cut while use the block to support my weight in yoga pose. My wrist is still trying to heal from the injury after more than a month. If you are looking for quality yoga block, make sure the block is solid and make of good material. Bamboo is way to sharp when it break."
2,Disappointed,"After reading the other reviews I was excited about my purchase. The block is smooth and true to size. However, during the first use I heard the block crack. After just three uses it broke."
3,"meh, its okay",It does what its supposed to but if you are using this for support rather than extend stretching it is not a good weight bearing product. I think mine is going to crack and send shards of bamboo into my hand every time i use it.
5,Nikon N75,"Great camera. I already own a digital Nikon DSLR but wanted to try the film experience and test what I have learned (and also what I have not) since I first grabbed my D80. This camera is very easy to use, lightweight."
5,excellent!!!,"item shipped exceptionally fast (ordered thursday morning got it saturday)! and the camera is in more than perfect condition. in all honesty, i feel like i underpaid for such a good quaity item. thanks so much!"
2,Film Transport has problems,"Put me down as another consumer that has had to send back his N75/F75. I received this camera new the other day. But, right out of the box it was broken. Seems on many of these models, when you try to load the film, it just backs it right in to the canister. The 75 is supposed to unwind the film to the end of the roll and then as you shoot, it winds it back up to the canister so that when you are done, the roll is completely in the canister. But, on mine, and many others, there must be a firmware bug. I'm waiting on a replacement now."
3,Decent Camera that has its problems,"I received the N75 as a birthday gift July '04 and have loved the many Nikon's I've owned and still even use my N8008. I liked the camera at first, as it is easy to use and produces very good photos. But after some light use (20 rolls of film) I noticed that it stopped allowing me to load film. Whenever I put the film in I get a load error and if I try it again, the film completed rewinds back into the case. I contacted Nikon about this and they have no clue, but told me to send it back and they will take a look at it. It is out of warranty and I know ill get billed so Im not sure if its worth sending back and paying over $100 to fix since I could completely replace it for a little over $200. If the camera works its good but I would steer away from the N75 and look at the other Nikon products."
3,nikon 25 mm camera-,"camera delivered as ordered. But it is only a fair camera, and I much prefer a digital model"
1,Cinnamon Stick tea,"This seller should use a mask, and a gun. I will never purchase anything from them again. I paid double the price, from this seller. Look closer, and you can find this product for way less."
1,Perfect to use it like toilet paper,"Hi, I am from Spain, and i Know more or less how everything work there, my boyfriend bought this book, and it was a completly crap, first the names of some areas are wrong, it is completly not updated, it says things like you can go to france and get another turist visa, Hello!!! we are now part of the European Union, so you don't need your passport to go to anyplace in Europe, and so you won't get a new turist visa, try to find any other book better that this and don't waste your money in this crapy book"
1,This Book is perfect for the trash,"Hi, I am from Spain, and i Know more or less how everything work there, my boyfriend bought this book, and it was a completly (...), first the names of some areas are wrong, it is completly not updated, it says things like you can go to france and get another turist visa, Hello!!! we are now part of the European Union, so you don't need your passport to go to anyplace in Europe, and so you won't get a new turist visa, try to find any other book better that this and don't waste your money in this (...) book"
3,Just scratches the surface,"I picked this up thinking it would be a detailed, comprehensive treatment that would lay out the reasons behind why nuclear strategy is what it is. Instead, I got a political science text that traces the history of nuclear strategy, but fails to lay it out. There's almost zero focus on the technical side of things and much actual analysis either. In fact, there's no real delving into strategy either - everything is merely presented, and not very well at that. The prose is dry and humorless - it is at best a broad overview of points of view held by various factions. Although I'm sure Freedman tried to present everything in an impartial and unbiased manner, it seems like he is dismissive of some issues, and places too much emphasis on others."
3,WHAT IS THIS???,"A ballad album marketed as a merengue album. Only four of the eleven songs are merengue and the rest are a couple of ballads and others bad enough for an amateour on a low budget film. The best songs are the merengues and ""Como Olvidar"" in ballad. The very worst songs are ""I Want To Have Fun"" and ""Me Gusta"". I guess now ""corillo"" is not a cool word to say anymore. Next time either make an album of mostly merengue and a seperate of mostly pop instead of a fusion of mess."
2,"Oh God Please, this cd needs Help..","I have always been an Olga Tanon fan, and have all her cds.. Latley she has left her Merengue Roots, and has tried Romantic Ballada, Flamencos, and yes even some Cumbias. But this cd can not compare to her other cds.. I found my self rewinding, looking for a song that would be catchy. But honestly every thing in this cd, would be expected from singers like Thalia, or Paulina Rubio.. This cd really disapointed me.. It is tropical, and yes dancible.. But they sound like show toons, something you would hear Iris Chacon sing, at a San Juan Hotel lounge.. Please give me a break, this is Olga Tanon at her worst."
5,La Reina de Merengue--Successful Yet Again,"Although Yo Por Ti may not be the most exciting of Olga's albums, it is certainly a beautiful mix of merengue and tropical beats that will get anyone dancing. It also may not be her most successful CD to date, but her strong and seductive voice comes through wonderfully, and she paints a beautiful romance story throughout the album. I think Olga fans throughout are pleased with this album, and I recommend any fan of Latin music to listen to this. Overlook its flaws and start dancing, becuase this Cd is still the high-quality Olga Tanon we all love. Viva Olga!!!!"
5,this is a great album,"With a new image, Olga returns with this new album. The cd has a variety of rhythms which keeps it from being a boring album of the same beats. It has merengue, bachata, guaguanco, salsa, and other blends of rhythms. The lyrics are at their best some very romantic and others that make you want to get up and dance. ""Tu te lo pierdes"" is one of most outstanding tracks. It rocks!! Other noticeable tracks include ""Como olvidar"", ""Yo por ti"",""Ahora soy mala"", ""Me gusta"", and ""Prohibido el Paso"". This is quite a versatile album which makes it very listeanble and enjoyable."
4,Olga leaves the dark ages.,"Great deliverance from her 1990's CD's, this is a very good prelude to ""Sobrevivir"". She's in very good form and the music is more versatile and better sung, if a little more pop. This is to be expected in this day and age. She has so much nonsense to compete with and here she delivers. Best Cuts: Tu Te Lo Pierdes, Como Olvidar (Balada), Pegaito, Mienteme, and Quiero Que Tu Me Quieras. Vocally she is in very good form and the material here is stronger then on previous recordings . I rate this a 4 star of 5"
1,water slide,This water slide apears alot bigger than it accually is .I have a two kids 7 and 4 and it was very hard for them to keep it still enough to accually get on .You have to tie it to something so it doesn't just float away.Overall it was a rip off.It intertained the kids for about 20 minutes.
3,Fun for a week but not all summer!!!,"The slide does work but it needs a lot of supervision. Its tricky to climb the slide but its fun once up there. You need to be careful that it does not drift to the pool edge as its easy to topple over. Our slide did spring a leak after a few days but it was easily fixed. If you want a bit of fun for a short time this is a good buy, if you want to enjoy it for any longer don't bother. the age range is small, too little and they can't climb up, too big and it becomes very unstable."
2,Fun but not heavy duty,After the first use it is already losing air. I don't think we popped it or put a hole in it. I have to pump it up every time we want to use it. I would go for the one that is a little more expensive and more heavy duty. It is just made of thin blow up material. A few years ago we bought the bigger one and it lasted for 1 1/2 summers. I think it only cost $20 more.
3,BEWARE!,"This is not a complete solutions manual.Included are worked, step by step solutions to only every other odd numbered question.Frankly, I thought I was purchasing a complete student study guide and solutions manual. I can do just as well with the internet for free, though with a bit more hassle."
5,Stores PSP 3000 unit and gear well,My son LOVES this travel/storage case - it holds the PSP 3000 game unit plus up to nine games - safe and secure - nice carrying strap options too!
3,Too big for what it can hold.,"This thing is simply too big (it's about a foot long) considering it can only hold three games and some memory cards. At this size there should've been room for a spare battery and earbuds. Logitech missed the mark on this one by focusing on some fancy strapping options and a useless plastic trim first rather than utility vs the competing $10 clamshell zip up cases that everyone else makes (which incidentally, can hold three games, an extra battery, memory cards and ear phones.)"
4,Songs of the Outback,As an avid fan of the show the music is the next best thing to seeing it. It is produced in Australia so we don't get to see enough episodes. That is why the the background songs are very endearing. It has a quality that is different than most and is hard to put it in a specific genre.
2,Fantastic,"When we bought the second volume of Mcleods Daughters I wasn't so sure that it would be as good as the first one but I was definatley wrong, there is such a mixture of happy songs and sad songs which brings back so many memories from the series. I can't wait for them to release another CD.If you are a fan of Mcleods and have not bought this then do you will have hours of endless memories from the series"
4,does the job,"yes this is nice, fragrance free. But my skin feels slightly dry again before I go to bed especially near the elbows - I apply it once again.After 2 months of use, my skin feels softer - this must be true for any body lotion :)It is little cheaper on amazon compared to retail stores."
1,New Lubriderm STINKS!,"I recently purchased some Lubriderm, Daily Moisture, ""fragrance free,"" to replace my empty bottle. The container said ""New Look,"" but it also smelled different--It smelled bad. It STINKS! I compared the ingredients, and sure enough--they changed. Even the old ""fragrance free"" had a smell, and a pleasant one at that. But the new stuff, ""fragrance free"" is not a pleasant smell. They had a good formula with the old stuff--""developed by doctors."" So why change it? Did the doctors change their minds? Maybe it works just as well, but please, Lubriderm: Change it back to the original."
4,"Good for dry skin, no oily feel, mild ""medicinal"" scent","After suffering from dry, scaly hands from the dry air of an office environment, this lotion is providing good relief. I did not try other brands, so I cannot give a comparison, but I can attest that my hands are smoother now and don't have that ""dry skin itchy"" feeling anymore.I also appreciate that the lotion doesn't leave much residue so it doesn't leave my keyboard and mouse an oily mess.My only gripe is the scent. The label states it is ""Fragrance Free"", which is true, but it does have a slight ""medicinal"" scent that I don't really like. Fortunately, it is not too strong and as long as you don't use too much lotion the scent isn't overpowering."
1,"""A Load of Crap"" by Phil Berger","Wow...The WORST example of not doing your homework I have ever seen. This book is the biggest load of crap I have ever seen. Let me say that not only does the guy not have ANY of his facts straight concerning Coach Knight, he does not care to get them straight. Example concerning non-incident between Coach Knight and student Kent Harvey ""Knight grabbing the kid and screaming profanities at him""...Did Phil not take the time to read the police report before writing this LIE into his book? The police dismissed the Harvey charge, the report says there were NO MARKS on the kids arm and 4 INDEPENDENT WITNESSES said Knight never raised his voice at the kid! Pathetic journalism....Does Phil write for the ENQUIRER in his spare time? He must since he acknowledges the local hack paper, the Star..... DONT BUY THIS CRAP."
3,An Interesting Story Beset by a Biased Storyteller...,"I read this book from the unbiased perspective of a college basketball fan looking to learn a little more about Bobby Knight, but Berger clearly didn't write it from an unbiased point-of-view.There were parts that were informative, and it was an interesting read, but Berger's anti-Knight bias came through on every page, sometimes in obvious ways, and sometimes subtley, like using the word ""claimed"" instead of ""said"" when quoting Knight.There were quite a few typos, misspelled words and grammatical errors, and they detracted from the book.If you're only going to read one book on Knight, read Feinstein's A Season on the Brink. But if you have a little more time on your hands, Berger's is still worth the read, typos, biases, and all."
2,Thrown together in a hurry!,"It's obvious that this book was put together pretty quickly in order to make a few bucks. Typos and spelling errors were evident. I don't suppose there will ever be a definitive Bob Knight book written. Knight wouldn't collaborate because it would have to show the total man, warts and all. And most writers probably wouldn't be interested in the good deeds he does behind the scenes for many people. The man was a tremendous coach but his complete story will probably never be told. Still, it was time for a change. The lust for winning created a Texas-sized ego in Indiana. It's just too bad he went out in much the same way as Woody Hayes."
3,Remote doesn't work with Windows Media Center,"Feels like I paid extra for a tuner with a remote, but then the remote doesn't work with Windows Media Center - only with the included Avermedia software (which isn't very good). If anyone knows how to get the remote working with WMC, please let me know. Thanks. Otherwise, it seems to work pretty well."
1,Composite inputs don't work,"I needed the composite imputs to work and they didn't. I sent the card back to Avermedia and they sent a second card with the same results. I tried the card on 3 different laptops 2 of them brand new and nothing worked. Avermedia suggested trying BeyondTV software instead, and that didn't work either. I spent many hours trying get this to work and I hope you don't make the same mistake."
2,RCBS Turret press not up to snuff !,"The unit has about .030 of play in the head and gives no prayer of any sort of bullet concentricity or repeat-ability. maybe a good option for the novice reloader, easy to use and conveniant all precision aside. A poor unit for precision reloading. As a 30 year fan of RCBS products and having owned most of there line I,m Disappointed ?Thomas Hindley"
3,Not up to the usual RCBS quality standard,"I have used the RCBS Rock Chucker single stage reloading press and it is a solid, quality piece of equipment. I thought that the RCBS product name would almost insure that any other RCBS product would be a top notch piece of equipment. That is not the case with the RCBS turret press. I found it to be crudely manufactured and just not up to the quality that I expected to find with RCBS. I should say that the turret press is a good piece of reloading equipment but if I were to do it again I would probably buy a Redding turret reloading press and save me the headache of dealing with something sub standard."
3,Not what I use to in bibles,This and others I have seem to lack what the old bibles use to have. There were tones of stuff missing and seemed for the most part a beginners guide for vista then a bible/reference manual for vista. I gave this one to a friend because I knew more then what was in it.
4,Windows Vista Bible by Alan Simpson,"I have another book by Alan Simpson the XP bible and it has helped me out numerous times so it was the first book I purchased when I was forced to switch to Vista. I think he writes in a clear easy to understand manner and everything is categorized in chapters and the index, for quick location.I don't find this a book one would read cover to cover but as a reference its indispensible. I find more answers through this than from any help program or asking others. The only reason I would not give it a five is because of its size, its a super thick full of information book but its cumbersome to keep on your desk or on your lap it wont stay open it has so many pages! Not really a complaint but I think perhaps a wire ring or coil binding might make it easier to deal with due to its size."
4,Excellent Product!,"I have been using this on my two large dogs in differing doses for two years. They are 80 and 120 lbs a piece, 8 & 10 years old. Before them I used it on my labrador that was able to walk and move until I put him to sleep at 17 years old. The key is start early and this is a great product to begin with and stick with."
1,Painful,"I bought this case from the Target store to take my machine to and from sewing class. I think the box said ""comfort grip handle"" or something like that (""comfort"" was in there somewhere). I think they made up the box on opposite day or something, because my hands were pink after carrying it for a short time. It's so cheaply made - very thin and unfinished. It's also very large for most machines. I lined mine with foam so it would not clunk around (I have a Brother model - which ever is the bestselling one on Amazon.) This machine is fine for storage purposes, but if you'll be doing a lot of transporting, I highly advise looking into something else. That's a lot of ranting for a sewing case!!"
3,Had much more potential,"This fit the movie very well, but stumbles as standalone music. Aside from the Titus controversy, most songs take too long to build up, then end when they are just getting interesting. Even the best songs don't flow very well, shifting tempos too abruptly. Three stars for the awesome To Victory and its remix, and to a lesser degree Fever Dream and Hot Gates. Some decent mood songs here as well, such as Tonight We Dine In Hell, but that's not why I bought this soundtrack. This well-done action movie's soundtrack should sound like action with a few pauses, not the other way around."
3,CD is awesome book not so much,"I bought this as a gift for my husband. He is very difficult to buy things for but he loved this movie. I spent the extra $$$ to get the collectors edition which is a nice hardbound book with stills from the movie. The cd was placed in a slot at the back of the book. No case and the book, though nice, does not justify the extra costs. Save your money and just buy the cd sounderack."
3,"Good, but not what I expected","Let me start this by warning anyone who's buying this to hear the loop from The Last Time which was used in The Verve's Bittersweet Symphony: The sweet string arrangement that starts the latter song is NOT part of this loop. I purchased this disc expecting to hear that pretty phrase somewhere in the song, but instead...well, I didn't. Somewhere, I even got the impression that the disc contained a sample of the loop they used for Bittersweet Symphony, but this is not the case.Not that this is a poor disc musically or sonically. Oldham created some very nice arrangements of these tunes and the mix sounds fine for 1966. The orchestra is augmented by drums and guitars and, in some ways, parts of the disc remind me of the song No Matter What Shape (Your Stomach's In) by the T-Bones, from that same year, only with strings and horns.Beyond that, all I can say is this in an OK album for what it offers, but it doesn't offer the loop I was expecting."
3,David Sinclair Whitaker did the orchestrations,I'm not a fan of The Rolling Stones. But I gotta confess that David Sinclair Whitaker took a piece of banal pop-crap called THE LAST TIME and transmogrified it into a masterpiece. And it incidentally contains the best-ever usage of tubular bells that I've ever heard in any piece of music.
3,Good but not worth the money..,"This item should be no more than $50. It does the job but a very Flimsy made item from china, go figure. Shop around..."
2,I regret spending this much money...,"A piece of the bar came bent, and I had to hammer it out and use pliers to change the shape so it would connect with another piece. The color coded instructions came printed out in black and white although it was quite easy to set up anyway...One piece doesn't align properly with the locking pieces. It wobbles like crazy even after adjusting the rubber pieces on the bottom. Overall? Unsatisfied."
4,Good!,"Though I have only used it once since it was delivered yesterday, I am very pleased so far. My only gripe is, the connections slip over each other and lock into place with a spring button locking clip. One of the connections didn't fit right, stripped the paint off, and is still difficult to slide in and out for space saving and storage when not in use. Still with that in mind it's a good buy and I probably just got a 1 in 100 bad one."
4,"Love it, great product!","Fast delivery and arrived without any damage.The assembly instructions could be improved upon because the picture they show is looking at it assembled from the bottom of the dip station.But, since the pieces are color coded that helps a lot even if the pic is confusing.It's well built, very sturdy and I get great range of motion and I'm 6'1"" 175 pounds. I can dip all the way down to my hands level with my pectorals, of course your knees are bent but even on a regular dip station in the gym I bend my knees.Oh and i like that I can disassemble it quickly if needed since it has push button locks. 4 stars because the instructions could be improved.Otherwise I really like this piece of equipment and I would recommend it to others."
3,"It's okay, should cost less","I would be happier if I paid $60. or $70. for this.It's basically a walker, like they sell for handicapped people. If I had thought of it, I could have bought a walker for about half the price of this.So...it works...but it's a little wobbly and a little pricey."
5,Works great,"Not sure why other reviewers were so critical. It works as a dip station and seems pretty solid/stable to me. As far as instructions, yes the piece of paper is a little puzzling at first. But, when you look at the color coded parts, common sense puts it together for you. I found this product through BodyRock.tv and am happy with this purchase.Other notes:- I am 5'10"" and the shorter height adjustment is perfect for me.- I am using this product on carpeted flooring.- I had no issues fitting pieces together during assembly. If anything, the connections have are not snug and have a bit of leeway. This may be a complaint for some, but once you position it correctly, it is stable."
2,Too costly and instable,"I was really anxious about the ""Ultimate Body Press"", but when it arrived and I assembled it, I was very disappointed. It is a very unstable construction and I had the impression that I did something wrong, but the construction itself is very weak and cheap.It works quite okay for me due to the lack of real alternatives, but it is a very disappointing product, considering that it cost about 100$.Wouldn't buy again."
4,Just what I expected,"Easy to assemble and take apart as advertised. Once connected there is a little wobble, but this goes away once your full body weight is added."
4,Good feels different from taller dip station,Good feels different from taller dip station but may just be use to taller but its goodGreat because manuverable
4,Great flexible product for home workouts,"I got mine during a promotion that included the extra accessories for hanging pushups.You can do many exercises with this including, but not limited to:> Pull ups (yes, you're supported by your legs, but you can elevate them and for advanced, can go into a ""pike"" position and use your full body weight)> Push ups (if you have the included accessory, they're great for narrow, wide, and alternating)> Dips - top is slightly tapered from front to back so you can do narrow dips or a bit wider. For more weight you can wear a weighted vest (I have a MiR)> Knee-raises (can add ankle weights)I really like how you can easily disassemble it and store it flat under a bed or in a closet.I keep it around so I have ""no excuses"" to exercise. Even if the weather sucks outside, you can do some effective exercises while watching TV instead of just sitting on the couch!"
1,Be Very Careful,"I've been doing dips for 20 years, and have never had a problem. The first thing I noticed about this device is that the bars are not parallel. I was concerned about that, and with good reason. After using this about 3 times (and I was already in great shape), I couldn't work out for about a week. After I felt better, I tried to do some dips and was in a lot of pain. A visit to an Ortho doc, along with an MRI showed that I had a complete rotator cuff tear in my left shoulder. Surgery followed, followed by 3 months of P.T., and 5 months later I'm finally able to do full pushups. I will never do dips again, that's for sure. Dips are a controversial exercise to begin with, so use your judgment when using this device."
2,I don't like it,"disappointing, poor packaging, the pieces were coming loose inside the box and can not bear the weight of the pieces so broke. instructions for assembly are very poor. armed after the team has a lot of vibration"
2,It's a decent dip bar.,"It's a decent dip bar, but it has some important drawbacks. For one, it is not as easily assembled or disassembled as one might think or as it may appear from the ads or website. Second, one may find oneself constantly adjusting the floor pads to maintain balance or levelness of the machine because if you don't it will rock back and forth to a small but noticeable degree. Third, the shipping & handling fee is a somewhat excessive (I know, it's not a necessity and I didn't need to buy it, but it's still annoying)."
3,it's okay,"Works fine, sturdy and gives me a way to do proper dips at home. Disappointed in the 'storage' method as you basically have to take it apart each time. From the images it looks more like it folds while staying in one piece, but that's not the case!"
3,Not as described,"The item is great; however, the joints do not fit well together. This means that I am unable to collapse it for storage."
2,Defective and uneven,"From reading the reviews I was pretty excited to get one. Once I received mine I put the unit together pretty easily. Took about two minutes, but once it was together I wondered why the unit was so uneven. I checked multiple times to make sure I didn't have any parts on backwards. After an hour I realized that one of the legs were slightly bent out of shape that made the whole unit crooked when put together. So disappointing, I was hoping to take this unit on vacation with me to stay in shape."
2,Poor Quality,Opened Packaged. Easy To assemble. Noticed that final product did not look like what it was suppose to be (Asymmetric). Returning ASAP. Going to get the Lebert Equalizer.
2,Unstable and not very functional...,"I bought this product because I'm a body weight exercise advocate. After using it I found it to be awkward and wobble way to much. So I bought the the RACK Pro and have never looked back, the rack is stable and way more versitle... There is no comparison between the two..."
3,Does the job but there are cheaper alternatives.,"This product works as advertised, but for the price and easy folding, I recommend this $20 item instead.Carex Dual Paddle Adult Folding Walker - Carex Dual Paddle Adult Folding Walker"
2,MEDIOCRE,"Good voices, lousy renditions.Others might like them, just not me.NINE MORE WORDS REQUIRED?THIS IS WHY I DO NOT REVIEW OFTEN,."
5,It doesn't get much better than this!,"If you're a fan of THREE MO', don't miss out! A great mixture of blues, opera, jazz, and a little bit of gospel at the end! These men are SO talented. Beware! You will find yourself getting up and dancing, too!"
5,The absolute best compilation of music,this is the best compilation of tenor voice and music. It's nothing short of awesome. I've have learned to appreciate Opera because of this CD. I also bought the DVD and it's better. Rodrick Dixon's voice is amazing and pure as is the counter tenor voice of Victor Cook. If you love great music this CD is a must have. The gospel medley is great also.
5,"Download it, SUPER!","These guys are great, super harmonies, voices to die for, realy cool mix of classical, Motown, musical theater and gospel!"
1,Christmas Window Candle with Suction Cup,The bulbs on these are not strong enough and most of the time the timer for on and off does not work properly. Big disappointment.
4,"Well built, and smooth operation.","Took 3 attempts to put together with pictures, I can't read German. Looks great and operates very nicely. Easy to adjust to different levels."
2,Well built with one major flaw...,"This rower seems to be well built and very sturdy. However, buyer beware, the design of this machine contains one major, VERY IMPORTANT flaw having to do with the resistance adjustment. The resistance is controlled by tightening knobs on the side of the machine at the bottom of each individual piston. Loosen the knob and you are able to move the bottom of the piston up (to increase the resistance) or down (to decrease the resistance). Regardless of how much I tighten each knob the resistance always loosens up during my workout. Sometimes one side will come loose before the other, producing an uneven workout. Eventually both sides loosen and the workout is much too easy.Which begs the question... Why didn't Kettler catch this problem during the testing phase of this product? I am extremely disappointed and would not recommend this product until Kettler comes out with a fix or different design with respect to the resistance adjustment."
4,Keeping in shape,"Easy to assemble. Heavy enough not to move on the floor when rowing. Good for a full body workout. Only drawback - display is in German, and uses the metric system."
3,Kettler Favorit Rowing Machine,"This rowing machine was fairly easy to assemble, however picturing the exact size of screws, nuts, bolts, etc. would be very helpful. The reason for 3 stars is the computer unit's lack of functionality. The directions for use are horrible and confusing. We still have not been able to get it to work properly. I emailed Kettler and they responded within 2-3 days. Unfortunately, their response was of no help. They said the computer unit automatically begins working when rowing begins and offered no other assistance. Numbers do appear at times, but the information displayed is inconsistent. The display doesn't automatically come on all the time, and the methods for using the unit's control buttons are not explained anywhere (including Kettler's email). Again, the rowing maching works great, but the computer stinks."
5,Get this rower!,"We bought this rower for our entire family to use (ages 11, 15 and 50.) It is easy and great to use and you will start to see results in a week or two. Good-bye to flabby arms and legs if you are over 50. Everyone, no matter what age will acquire more strength and definition. We use it while watching t.v. and the time just flies. It is a solidly built machine with a smooth movement. Easy to store upright and out of the way. Hint: notches and knobs where the handle ends and the piston meet is the point of adjustment, lower or raise from easy to more difficult."
3,computer works--sometimes,"Researched this rower and saw various people said the computer didnt work but rower was ok. Took a chance and that is exactly right. Half the time we use it the computer just sits there on temp and wont recognize machine is in use. Plug and unplug the computer to no avail, only pulling the battery makes it work. Then a time or two later when you go to use, it ignores you again!:( Also the writing on computer is in German so you have to learn which is which by location, unless you happen to read German! Rower itself gives a good workout, 4 stars. Computer sucks, 1 star so overall a 3!"
2,the smallest book on my coffee table,"it is my guests' favorite coffee table book, it is about nothing and everything. The next best thing would be to have the plans on CD so that when the need arises, its plug and print, cut out and VOILA."
1,Probably the most horrid book I ever tried to read,"This book was TERRIBLE! Thankfully it was free - I guess you truly do get what you pay for. I have few pet peeves, okay more than a few but.....1) How many times can you use the word ""peppermint"" per chapter? Answer: WAY too much. 2) Is her name spelled Sarah or Sara? Make up your mind. 3) Lots of dirty internal sex dialog with Sara(h) and then the word ""gosh""??? Puh-lease!! I could go on and on and on and on, but I want to rinse the bad taste of this book out of my brain. Avoid it, even though it is free."
1,"stinks, don't waste your money or your time if its free","I thought this book sounded like a good mystery type story with some added romance. Well, the mystery part wasn't bad based on where this man came from since he lost his memory and what happened to him. But, if you were hoping for some romance, forget it. This was the most disgusting book I've read. The author was so descriptive and coarse that she described the ""enormous cock"" right down to the shape and veins. There was constant crude language regarding the woman's ""pussy"" and more. I skipped over pages of crude, vulgar, and nothing more than porn in a book trying to just find out how the mystery played out. I'm glad I didn't pay 1 cent for this and am disgusted that I put any time into it. So, I rarely write reviews on books, but this one I felt was my duty to give a fair warning to those of you who like a little romance that this isn't it! The title makes it sound kind of innocent - lol!"
1,"Beware, it is not really a mytery.....","Took advantage of this free Kindle read thinking I was picking up a good mystery. This books was disgusting with the author's failed attempts at romance and lust. It is mainly graphic and unsexy descriptions of genitals, etc. It is more of a porn book and if you like that kind of read, this is it! Trite, unbelievable plot."
1,Peppermint Creek Inn,"I thought the description sounded like a good read. In all fairness, the beginning of the book gives a warning as to what the content might include, but of course, you don't get that until you get the book. I got this when it was free and before most of the reviews were written or I probably would have passed.That being said, I think the story would have been a decent mystery without all the extremely graphic sex. The first part of the book described what they wanted to do to each other and the second part they did it. So much that quite a few times I felt like I was reading porn. I'm not a prude but I kept wondering if all the descriptions were really necessary to tell the story.I found myself skipping some of it just to get to who the bad guys were. The whole amnesia and bad cops story without the graphic sex would have made this a good book."
5,A great set of tunes,"I heard an excerpt from this CD on NPR one morning...had to pull over and write down the artist. Ordered it at my first opportunity, and have enjoyed every listening moment. If you like jazz, this is a great choice!"
5,"Hayes ""Little Rock"" Carll","Love the sounds on this CD. Country, Rock, Blues , HC can to it all at the same time and make this old country boy feel at home. Can't wait for more."
4,Put this in your collection!!,"This album is a deserving purchase for any hipster that holds fast to his opinion that he / she knows the real deal. Very impressed. There is no need to partake in a detailed evaluation of the music on ""Little Rock"". I hold fast that competition is a sin within the art of music. To me, simple appreciation holds the candle to light the way, and this is truly an album to appreciate and enjoy. Enough said. Good luck Hayes."
3,Stuff from Spain,This cd is good not great. It is their first one so you can't expect much. It does have a lot of energy through most songs although it does sound like kiddie music.
4,Interesting treatment of the density matrix and Mandelstam variables,"Ziman's book addresses a number of topics associated with quantum field theory, including Feynman diagrams. It is not these topics that interested me in this book, however, as there are other books that address the same topics in QFT. My favorite part of this book was Ziman's discussion of the density matrix (sections 4.1-4.3, pp.94-101)--especially that he placed it in terms of the integral for the expectation value rather than solely in terms of bra/ket notation. I also liked the section (6.1) on relativistic kinematics that included Mandelstam diagrams (pp.203-207)."
2,"Not a book, more like a scrap book","Another self-published effort by Mr. Rosenberg that collects a jumble of original research about baseball star Cap Anson. Unnfortunately, Mr. Rosenberg then rambles on about the various newspaper stories and what Rosenberg calls ""captaining"" endlessly, and occasionally, incoherently. Anson certainly deserves better coverage than this odd publication provides."
5,The same old favorite.,"I doubt anyone will ever write better horse-stories than Walter Farley; kids love them, and I'd rate them equal to ""Treasure Island"" or ""The Jungle Book"" as far as entertainment value."
1,Hhmmmm.......,"Well, I didn't find this book of any consequence. It wasn't the best. Alec was depressing me, I couldn't finish the book! I could only get halfway through! I read most of the others and loved them! This one was,frankly, a disapointment."
1,Another bizarre weird plotline.,"Massive earthquakes rock the world and wreak destruction while fulfilling a Native American prophecy. Sounds like the plot from a bad movie, right? Actually it is the plot of Farley's 20th book in the Black Stallion series. After Pam's death, Alec flees with the Black west to Arizonia where a Native American tribe claims that he and his black horse are the sign that they have been looking for that the end of the world is near. This is probably the most bizarre book in the series. Besides being completely improbable, it never resolves Alec's feelings over the death of Pam. Instead it just throws him into another disaster that seem to characterize most of Farley's plot lines."
3,His Personal Troubles and Strain,"What you have to realize is his presonal strain is Pam's (The Black Stallion and the Girl) death, and riding strain, making it Hopeful Farm's financial strin in the long run. The funny thing is, when he flees West, he has NO RECOLLECTION WHATSOEVER of his putting the Black in trailer. Weird, huh?"
3,OK I guess,"Not one of his best books, as it goes way past melodramatic to downright silly in some parts.However, being a ghost/UFO-lover and horse lover at the same time I can appreciate the fact that Mr. Farley wasn't afraid of doing something different with a horse story.Still, if you want supernatural horse stories, pick up ""The Black Stallion's Ghost"" or ""The Island Stallion Races"". Or grab a copy of ""Horse Fantastic"". Much better stories and better writing, IMO."
2,Depressing,"If you like horror films, you'll probably like this book. I'm 15, and I've read a thousands of books, and sometimes I'd get a little depressed or sad if the book was really, really sad or depressing, but with this book!I was an emotional wreck. I was in an almost state of shock, depressed for several days, and felt all weird and creepy, and I guess dark, after I read the book. But yet no matter how much I wanted to put the book down, I couldn't. It was almost supernatural. I know he wrote it after his daughter Pam was killed in a car accident, and it was like everything he was feeling, he was able to put it in the book so that anyone who read would feel the same way."
4,Best Top Duster,"This cover looks and works great. It keeps your gear dry and clean. The only drawback is it DOES NOT work with the factory bows on. That wasn't the end of the world for me because I love the way it looks now, but its is wrong in the description."
2,Would not work with top bow in place.,"I purchased this as the Bestop web site indicates it will work with the top-bow in place. I found it impossible to fasten one side with the bow in place. It is extremely tight even with the bow not underneath it.I returned it since I often switch between safari, bikini, and full tops."
4,Useful product,Product works well especially if you do quite a bit of lifting however I only gave it 4 stars because the upper back doesn't provide as much support as if the shoulder blades were also supported.
5,i like it,"i may have the wrong size tho, i did measure myself hmm eventually i might buy a small and see if that will stay where i want it, i did put it on when i went out to do laundry and didnt feel the pain in my lower back at all it was great!!! so it will do wonderfully well if i get into a physical job."
2,Not worth it,I got this for posture more than back support - which I guess go together but this doesn't do anything for my posture. It's bulky and not very comfortable. I'm returning it.
2,A JFK Assination Researcher,"This book is very well written as you would expect from a well known author and playright such as Mr. Kirkwood, however it is very one sided as anyone who reads this with an open mind will notice. Upon researching this book I came across the information that Mr. Kirkwood wrote this book at the request of a friend to whom the book was dedicated, who was originally requested to do a positive report of the trial by Clay Shaw himself. This neutralized any information I read and made me consider it an interesting work of fiction."
3,pain reliever,"Bioflex Magnetic Elbow Wrap - Elbow Support WrapI purchased this for my husband who's elbow had been hurting for quite a while. We have used magnetic products before and appreciate their benefits. He wore it for a couple of days, his elbow felt better and he quit wearing it. I asked him why he quit. He said it doesn't bend so it's uncomfortable to work in. So he only wears it when he isn't working. The main thing is it helped his elbow stop hurting. It's hard to tell from the picture but this is all one piece of spongy material, with velcro tightening bands. I have magnetic wrist wraps that I wear when my wrists hurt and they also are not as flexible as I would like. But they are very therapeutic and quickly help my carpal tunnel."
5,This is how you get your license!,"Gordon West, WB6NOA, is the ONLY way to learn the material for your FCC Amateur Radio License. I'm already a Tech with General Theory Credit and am well on my way to Amateur Extra! See 'ya on the airwaves!"
5,"An enjoyable, truthful tale of the journey to becoming a vet","As an aspiring veterinarian, I was very moved by the story of what so many of us are facing throughout our education. No holds barred--some of the chapters are a little harder to read emotionally, but there is always an underlying element of the hard truth which comes with the profession. A VERY good read..."
2,"Loretta, Personally?","Didn't anyone else dislike Loretta Gage?I'm sure she didn't write this to win a popularity contest, but it was difficult for me to read the writings and thoughts of someone that turned me off shortly after I started reading.In fact, I have to admit that I only made it 3/4 of the way through the book.I wouldn't have her as my pets' vet or my friend."
5,Beautiful Watch,I was given this watch as a college graduation gift and it will be something well remembered. It has a simple design and it resembles the actual look of a watch while feeling like you are wearing a nice bracelet. It is a great momento for any occasion.
1,Not much better than the manual,"This video is fine if you can't bring yourself to read the owner's manual, but it doesn't add much more than that. And it has a diverse cast of characters to keep things interesting, but it's obvious only 1 person really knows what he's talking about. Not recommended."
4,Plant Bracket,"The plant bracket was received as expected and looked just like the photo. It was easy to install, sturdy and I like the butterfly accent."
3,diana..ever after,"While I consider myself a Diana expert and have read everything about her since 1981, I am always looking for a new insight or a new spin on things that are already public knowledge. I was pleased with the book but it reassembled many parts out of previous books to make this book. I was also disappointed to see a reference to a trip to Monte Carlo to pick out the supposed engagement ring, but anyone who has read the Trevor Rees-Jones' book knows that no such visit occured. I am also disappointed when the writer makes more of the summer romance then what it was, never taking into consideration the short length of time the 2 spent together and Diana's need to make another man jealous."
4,Very Soulful. Unrecognized recording,"I am a Motown recording collector, and to be honest I was not expecting much, but loved the recording. The Funk Brothers are consistent with their musicianship, but the surprise is Kiki Dee's vocals. The standouts are ""There Will Come The Day Between Sunday and Monday, the very moody ""Jimmy"" , ""Johnnie Raven"", which was later covered by The Supremes."
4,Good Product,"I have terribly sensitive skin. This product doesn't irritate it at all. It soothed the redness of my acne. My only complaint is the way it comes out. It's a very misty spray. It gets atomizes everywhere and gives me a tight feeling when I breath, so I hold my breath."
3,Pre-Holocaust Reality,"Nice music, nice performing and some food for modern listeners' thoughts as 65 years after Holocaust run away.This work is a bit long, probably."
5,Same Soul and Enegy with a new tune,"Once again doing a Great job, I hear their first Cd, great music, reggue, Ska, cumbia, salsa, rap. This people are super talent, Voices, trumpets, percussion,the whole deal.This new Cd come's with great new sound, it is tight and with tons of joy, Music that wants you to dance and chill and the same time.It is a 100% satisfaction if you are those that like Manu Chao, ozomatly, Mano Negra,La Juana production then you need to get this new cd."
3,A Sherlock Holmes book by any other name is still a Sherlock Holmes Book,"This book contains six Sherlock Holmes short stories. They are all ""okay"", as I am a Sherlock Holmes fan and enjoyed them simply because of that fact and not because they were well-written stories. If you are a Sherlock Holmes fan, yes, it is worth the time and money but if you aren't a fan or are new to the genre I would suggest another title, maybe something by Nicholas Meyer. And if you are looking for a 'different' Sherlock Holmes book I highly suggest ""Shadows Over Baker Street"". This is an anthology that mixes Sherlock Holmes with the darkness and horror of the stories of H.P. Lovecraft."
3,Rambling but fun for Sherlockians,"This book and the others from the Thomas three book series are fun for the lovers of Sherlock Holmes. Told by Watson, these are ""lost"" stories. The writing is a little rambling, but engaging."
2,Ok sound,"Compared to the Panasonic DJ Street models, these do not hold a candle to them. Much more fragile, thinner design and the sound is not as good; left side is staticky, would not buy again."
3,This CD is Nice..... But I like Jane Austen Companion Better,This CD is nice but not one that I will listen to often.The fact that you get to hear what music Jane Austen liked is quite amazing. When you think I'm listening to music that Jane Austen listened to over 200 years ago.However I'm not a great fan of Opera Music and that is probably why this CD is not one that I will listen to often.But if you like listening to Opera Music. You will like this CD.
1,Where is Mana'o Co.'s original cover of 96?,"This CD would easily rate a 5 star review, EXCEPT for that fact it lacks their original cover of Third World's ""96 Degrees in the Shade"". What in the world is going on with this?Mana'o does an excellent cover of that song, but what is on this album is NOT it. That re-mix is about the worst song I have ever heard. Why isn't their original cover of that song available?For that matter, why isn't their original album with that song available?Mana'o is a great band, but they MUST make their original version of 96 available. I refuse to buy the monstrous re-mix that is only available."
3,Not what I thought it would be,I find it to wordy and hard to follow. I am a poor reader and need a more direct approach to the direction for the actions required for the outcome you are looking for.
3,Excel 2007 for Dummies,I found this book to be extremely helpful. I appreciate the simple-language instruction it contains. It has saved me hours of trying to figure out some of the more complicated processes on my own.
2,not so good,A lot of info not needed. Hard to follow and not so good indexing and reference. I was disappointed. I'm too much of a dummy to follow it - it ain't easy. The help files in the program are much better with Excel 2010.
2,To much,"Way to much info. I need to know how to use excel, this book assumes that you already know the basics. In a word: overkill."
4,Excel,Learned this stuff a LONG time ago but had forgotten how I had set stuff up. Entered a new job and needed to set some new work sheets. The book really did what it said.
5,EXCEL 2007 FOR DUMMIES,ALOT FOR THE MONEY. EVERYTHING YOU WOULD WANT TO KNOW ABOUT EXCEL. SOME OF IT WAY OVER MY HEAD. MAYBE I'' LEARN IT THOUGH.
1,Did not find this book helpful,"This was the first ""...For Dummies"" book I've purchased, and I found it uniquely unhelpful. It's about a 700 page book full of baloney. Not a single thing about it was easy to understand or use - not even the Table of Contents."
2,Totally disappointed,"I guess I should've read the fine print more closely. When the description said ""mini"" it really meant it. These are so cute and I had great intentions to give them as a gift but they are soooo small that a normal adult really couldn't get much comfortable use out of them. Loved the colors and had no problems with shipping though. I thought I would've gotten more for my money from Tupperware brand."
4,THE DARE WAS...,"a bit dissapointing, I must admit. But worth reading because it was very surprising and very original. Very different. You won't be able to guess what was really going on, but that doesn't make up for how dissapointing the explanation was. However, it just goes to show how creative R.L.Stine can be and that's why I gave it four stars."
3,"Intresting, typical, fast, and easy book to read =)",This book was a pretty typical book where the popular jock (Dennis) ends up getting with the looser girl (Johanna) who isn't to pretty. But the book has a twist; Dennis only tries to get with her to try to kill the teacher he mortifies. I don't believe it's the best book I have ever read but it didn't put me to sleep.
2,It Was an R.L. Stine Flop,"The Dare is a regular Fear Street horror book. Nothing different than any other. Nothing was unusual, weird, creepy, scarier than any other. It was boring and I wouldn't recommend to anyone. It was surprising."
1,Did RL stine write this?,"Normally, I love fear street books, but this one was terrible! It was pointless, you couldn't relate to the character, it didn't make sense, and it was boring. There is no suspense in this book, and the main character is really weird. My advice: Don't buy it."
3,OK for the young budget traveler,"I bought this book, the Lonely Planet Spain, and Time Out Barcelona, and I would strongly recommend the Time Out guide instead of this book. I found the Lets Go book to be lacking all-around. It was good for a brief overview of Barcelona and what to do there befor we left, but once we arrived we never picked it up again...and we were inseparable from our Time Out book. The only time I would recommend the Lets Go book is if you will only be in Barcelona for a day or two."
1,Awful,"There is an old saying about not judging a book by its cover. That is not always true. Look at the cover of ""Jettison"" and you get an idea of what this book is like--cheap, derivative, shallow.This originally started out as a piece of ""fan fiction"" written by a Trekkie. It has all the flaws of that genre--impossible situations, flat characters, and fantasy heroics.It is a shallow, uninspiring book. Avoid it at all costs."
5,True craftsmanship,"What a beautiful display of true Architecture for Architectures' sake. Yeah, you may need a bit of $$ to personally afford buildings with this calibur of workmanship, but it will be well worth it and timeless. Builders and purchasers of todays' Suburb homes need to look to great works like these to realize the real issue of urban sprawl.Great book. Great photo's. Great ideas. Great craftmanship. Outstanding architecture."
2,"liked other flavors, not this one!","Too oily, did not like the flavor combination. Was not able to return after trying. Go for chocolate/rasberry!"
5,nutrients information,All the products in Grocery section should have the link to their nutrients information including calorie counts.
4,"fantastic, but chew carefully","I love these bars and will continue to buy them, but beware that they occasionally contain small pieces of cashew shell, which are as hard as rocks. Chew carefully."
2,Very strong chocolate flavor,"I saw these at a local health food shop and decided to give it a try since I wanted a dairy free chocolate bar. You certainly get the dark chocolate - very strong and bitter. I knew coconut was in there from the label, and from the shreds of it I could see in the bar but I really did not taste any coconut - the chocolate flavor overpowered it completely. The label says it contains almonds, but you don't taste that either. I was hoping for more of a harmonious blend of both chocolate and coconut. It certainly isn't sweet either."
3,Better flavor than the cashew bars,"These bars have a pasty consistancy and are greasy with a slightly off-taste (in my opinion). They are very sweet and are, indeed, filling so they are great in the car when trying to avoid fast-food but I only like them enough to use them as a last resort. Great ingredients though and probably very good for the body."
4,DELICIOUS!!!!!,"I was more than surprised when I started to eat this meal bar. It is absolutely delicious! It is 280 calories, which I think is high, but it is worth it. Have this coconut and chocolate bar as a dessert you won't feel guilty eating."
1,Just plain awful,"I can at least tolerate most foods, but these bars were so bad that I threw them away. Very disappointing."
1,so gross!,"I can't believe how gross these bars are! They sounded pretty good, and after reading the other reviews, I thought I'd give them a try. I sure wish I hadn't!!! Now I am stuck with a whole box, and I couldn't even gag one of them down. They have the worst aftertaste. It doesn't even taste like edible food. They are greasy and taste like vomit. Sorry to sound so dramatic, but I want to prevent you from making the same mistake I did and save you your money. Don't buy them!!!ps- is there anybody out there who actually likes them and wants to buy a case minus 1 off of me?! I'll sell them for cheap!! :0)"
1,"Another organic bar, but its HALF fat.","This bar has 265 calories and 135 from fat. I know, I know, its organic!! Sorry just because its organic and natural doesn't mean that it can be 50% fat and be good for you. If you like the taste fine, but be honest you're eating it for the taste, about the same calories and fat content as a Dove candy bar."
4,Good,"I like these, but I like the chocolate better(my favorite). I purchase them all the time at whole foods, I like getting a full box, but would love a variety pack."
5,Yummy,"I LOVE these. It didn't take long to go through the entire box. My son loves them too. These were, by far, our favorite. We also tried the raspberry chocolate (still really good) and the raisin chocolate (ok, but couldn't taste any raisin). I am here to buy more of these and try more flavors. If you are looking for raw bars, or just some healthy snacks, don't look any further. One more note, before going raw, I was a chocoholic, I thought for sure that I wouldn't like the one I got that didn't have chocolate, but I love it!!"
2,not so great. try larabars!,"i don't know how you can mess up coconut and chocolate, but they did. for the amount of fat and calories in these babies, they should taste a lot better. if you're really looking for delicious raw food bars, i prefer 'larabars.'"
4,RAW REVOLUTION - HAZELNUT,"THESE ARE DENSE BUT SOFT,CHEWY BARS THAT MAINLY CONSIST OF CHOCOLATE AND NUTS. THERE WILL BE AN OILY FEEL BECAUSE OF THE NUTS, BUT OUR FAMILY LOVES THESE AND THEY ARE A QUICK, HEALTHY SNACK THAT WE FEEL GOOD ABOUT EATING. CHILL FOR LESS OF AN OILY LOOK/FEEL."
2,only if you love dates,"I bought 3 ""flavors"" of these bars, but I can't tell them apart - they all just taste like dates. It's pretty bad when you can't tell spirulina from coconut!"
2,"They sent the wrong bars, and they were expired.... NICE!!!","I don't see any way to contact the shipper... So I have to say it in a review. They sent the Chocolate and Coconut bars which are NOT the Coconut Bliss Bars and they expired January 9th 2013... they were shipped out on January 28th 2013. Just be aware... I opened the box right away and threw it out, and ate a couple of bars before I realized it they were old. I have not gotten sick, but they don't taste good... plus they are not the right bars."
5,Delicious & thank god they're available on Amazon!,"Living in the Bay Area, I used to pick these up for lunch and snacktime from Whole Foods every single schoolday. They're nummy--taste just like chocolate and raspberries, not fake tasting, rich and savory--and my body feels better eating them than snacking on normal chocolate bars.I just recently moved to a rural area inequipped of a Whole Foods/store that carries vegan treats. THANK GOD I can order them here, and you know what, they're insanely cheaper by the box than by buying them two at a time every day. I've been snacking on them for a month, and there's still half a box left! They're especially good at quelling those pre-menstrual chocolate binges, and are better for you. They taste good, you'll feel good. Enjoy!"
2,Not the greatest,"I was hoping I would be a fan, but I had a hard time getting it down. It just wasn't what I expected. The chocolate taste was a little too powdered cocoa tasting and bitter."
3,Ok...,"I want to start this out by saying that I am not on any sort of vegetarian or raw food diet.These bars are ok. I have only had one but I noticed that as I got through them the taste seemed better.I did not find them excessively greasy but they are high in fat.I intended to use these as a meal replacement, as a natural alternative to the energy bars that are basically vitamin enriched candy bars that somehow don't taste as good and I am sure that that is what I will do.The one thing that keeps me from giving this item more stars is that it has an acidic aftertaste that reminds me of stomach acid and can make me a little queasy but not as bad as the regular energy bars."
3,Can't seem to enjoy these,"I was very disappointed with these bars. I wish I had not bought two boxes of these. I am generally not very picky about what I eat as far as taste goes and the ingredients all sounded good to me but somehow these bars are just not good. I hated to write a bad review for anything but I really can't eat these. I don't think I know anyone that I would even try to give them to. I tried these and the spirulina ones and both were equally unappealing. Maybe the chocolate ones might be ok, I don't know."
2,Coconut - Too darn fatty and greasy,"I have found the coconut to be too greasy. Coconut naturally has a high fat content but this bar is too greasy. I'm going to try to keep 'em in the fridge but I doubt it will be that great. I'm going to try to give them away to my friends, so in the end I recommend not buying this flavor."
4,alkali,"I have been a raw foodist for a few months now. I rather liked the taste of these bars, and I applaud the company for making nutritious food so convenient.However, I was disappointed that the cocoa is processed with alkali. This processing destroys most of the flavonols, which is what all the health studies that are based on raw cocoa rave about. If they used real quality beans that didn't need this processing, I would give this product 5 stars."
1,DISGUSTING!!,"Wow! I did not know that someone could make a business selling food that tastes so bad! No wonder these are called Raw Revolution... they taste revolting!!It seriously blows my mind that someone could make a food with chocolate and coconut that tastes so awful. The first taste is poor, at best. The mouth feel is grainy. And the aftertaste... wow thats nasty.I ordered these b\c they were on sale and I wanted to try organic raw food. Good thing that was a cheap lesson. Learn from my mistake. DONT BUY THIS!"
1,hated them,"I was expecting something that would taste good and have a good texture. Wrong on both accounts. My family hated them too. (didn't try it on the dog, though). Very disappointing. I'll stay with promax, cliff bars and power bars."
5,Classic American art,"I love this painting and I've gotten so many compliments on the poster. Great size- really adds to my dorm room. Great colors, interesting image, highly recommend."
1,Cheap packaging,"Great Poster; had about 20 kinks clearly visible due to the CHEAP packaging ( not a tube, but thin triangular cardboard............)NEVER EVER AGAIN................."
1,*pffffffffft* pllleaaase. I demand a back bone!,I got about half way threw this book and pitched it in the trash. The heroine has absolutly no back bone at all! She just does everything she is told to do even though it is compleatly unfair and well... mundane! I could get more action at the farmers market! I felt no chemistry at all between her and the main love intrest. On a good note the author seems to have a wonderful grasp on basic wrighting. The wrighting is fluent and descriptive.
4,Beautiful!,I love my ring! It was exactly what I was hoping for and it looks amazing with my engagement ring. I can't wait until I can wear it all the time. =)
5,Pretty and Dainty,"I love this ring. I got the yellow gold ring which has the white gold prongs. It is very sparkly and dainty which I like. It compliments my wedding set and doesn't compete with it. A great deal! Although, I bought it for $99.99 when it was on sale."
4,"slim, prestige and pretty","I received the package in Singapore ^^ two days after I placed the order.It is very beautiful; definitely worth the price @ $159. I love the spread of the seven diamonds which has a nice setting whenever I wear it.For men, it would be a wonderful gift for your girlfriend, wife or mother.For women, if you are looking for something with budget, this is great."
5,Sparkling and Beautiful,"My husband got me this ring in yellow gold for the holidays because I wanted something to go with my wedding ring. This ring is everything the other reviews say it is! It fits perfectly on my finger with my wedding ring, looks beautiful and the diamonds are well-set, well-faceted and very sparkly. I'm 5'3"" and it looks perfect.If you're looking for a smaller ring that makes a wonderful statement, I can't recommend this one enough :)"
4,Quite feminine and beautiful,"I found this ring to be what I expected from the image. It's quite nice and the stones are small, but not too small. Excellent ring to add to your wedding finger to help bring out the shimmer and compliment your already existing piece or wear on your right hand - which I do. It's light in weight, the stones are a little cloudy, but do catch sparkle. For the price it was a good investment. I may even buy another and wear them together!"
2,Not worth price paid,"Not worth the price paid. Its a nice ring but its too small, thin, and the quality can be found for less"
4,Beautiful!,I'm completely satisfied with this ring! It's even prettier in person than the picture online. It's very dainty and feminine.
3,It was ok..,"I recieved this ring from my boyfriend. It was nice, but the ring size was too big.. I sent back the ring."
3,its not bad for the price,"looks better in the picture than when you get it, different than the pictures that were submitted the diamonds are smaller and not very sparkly but for the price it is a nice ring"
4,Picky! Picky!,"This is the Bible of the picky stuff for French. This is an older edition, but it is still invaluable for the serious student of the language. It has exhaustive analysis of grammar to the point of polemic, but it really is the final word on many topics. I'd recommend the newest edition you can get, if you can stomach the price tag, since language does continue to evolve."
2,One of the Un-funniest books ever published,"Perhaps the concept is a bit thin to begin with--essentially, a book of unconnected jokes on pop culture from the fifties to the nineties. The humor here is barely college newspaper level, from cbeap wordplay (""Cabbage Patch Adults!"") to just plain obvious (Brittany Spears wearing a tube top that says ""ejaculate here""). Sending up pop-culture is a national pastime. You have to do a little better than this to warrant putting out a book."
2,Disappointed,"There was some hype about this book - it made it to a few 'Great New Books' Lists, so I was eager to read it. I haven't been able to finish it and have abandoned it for more interesting (captivating) works. The short stories are adequately written and could actually have been something if there was ever a purpose to the writing. They leave you scratching your head and saying, ""so, where's the end - what's the point?"" It did not hold my attention, I was not engaged by it, which is why it was shelved before finishing in favor of something else."
3,Not bad for his first try,"I found the storyline to be incredibly fascinating and original. The world of Tyr is easily imagined and believable due to the descriptive narration of the people and terrain. While there are grammatical and spelling errors, I fully understand that this book is self edited. This in no way detracts from the enjoyment of the book. Overall I would say it is an excellent read and an excellent first novel for a new writer. I look forward to watching him grow in his writing as he does in age. I feel strongly that the two will coincide and continue to improve. I recommend the book to all who love a good story and support first timers. I am quite certain that Steven Oliverez will be a writer to contend with in the future."
4,Escape to Tyr,"I usually focus on YA/Middle Grade novels, so it was delightful to cozy up with a fantasy book written for adults.The Elder Staves has solid world-building, believable characters (who you become invested in) and a suspensful plot that keeps the pages turning.If you're looking for an escape into a fantasy realm where saboteurs run rampant instead of unicorns - than this is a book for you."
4,The Elder Staves.... Steven Oliverez,"A great read! You won't want to put it down! A fantastic mix of fantasy and sci-fi and a touch of humor and romance as well! I look forward to more from Steven Oliverez.Lee Ann LeadbetterWindham, Maine USA"
2,It's OK,"I read a lot of sci-fi and fantasy and while the book was interesting, it didn't grab my attention. I found the plot a bit weak and the characters lacked dimension. I have read some of the author's short stories on his myspace and I enjoyed those a lot so I expected more from his novel. But he has talent and if he writes a second novel I will probably read it as well."
5,Story,"Yes, the book is self-published, and without the benifit of a mass of editors it does have its grammar issues. That aside, it's easily my favorite book this year, and it seems that many others enjoyed it every bit as much as I did. I'm betting that in a couple years this first edition will be a collector's item."
4,Great Book,This book was fun to read. It gets you wonderfully lost in another world full of interesting characters and action filled story. I'll definately look forward to Steven Oliverez's future books!
1,This Book is harder and more confusing than the test.,This book isn't accurate to the test. The math is much harder in this book than it was on my test. This book made me very nervous about my test and was not very helpful. The CD-ROM included is also disappointing and more of a bother than a help. Get a different CBEST book.
4,This book was good preparation,"This book completely prepared me for the CBEST.The reading comprehension section and the essay sectionwere completely accurate in comparision to the actual test.However, having just taken the exam, the math in the book is actuallya little harder. The book did make me nervous in that way - I foundthe math pretty hard and expected the exam to be the same. However,I am glad the math was harder than the actual test because it really prepared me. Not only that, it prepares you for the even HARDER math that is on the CSET, the next exam you must take to become a teacher in CA. Overall, a very good book."
3,racquet only one side,"this racquet is great, but you only can play with only one side? the other side just pure wood? I don't know if that how it suppose to be or not when I received it....but I'm a little bit confused if someone can answer this question?"
3,"RE:racquet only one side, June 27, 2006","I think that is for practicing only one kind of stroke with an instructor. Or if you want to play from one side, you can do that as well, but I don't think i would like that though. You might be able to get rubber for the other side from a table tennis club near you - they sometimes make rackets in store."
3,not as good as expected.,"the wood of the plate is as good as my old ""double happy"".the edge is so sharp and I had to ground that by myself before I can use it for more than 5 minutes."
1,An insult to B movie fan's,"To call this a movie is being way to generous and an insult to even the biggest B movie fan. It comes across as a bunch bored kids want to make their own slasher flick while Mom and Dad are away for the weekend.(Now for the film)It starts with a bunch of bored pretentious kids (20 year olds) welcoming a new member to their group, they start telling about their deepest fears, then one says to everyone leave for an hour so I can set up a skit for us to play. They return and granny (Rubber mask slasher) starts killing. The so called director of this (Made over the weekend home movie) tries to put an obvious twist at the end and of course there is another obvious twist to the twist.If you pay even a dime on this film you have paid way too much."
1,Product Did Not Fit 2010 Mazda 3 as Advertised,"I did not open or try to install this product until Jan 2013. By that time Amazon would not accept a return unless I paid return shipping. Do you know how much rotors weigh? Even though I never opened the box, their rules are 'must be opened and returned within thirty days'. I ended up buying replacements at NAPA. I will never order car parts from Amazon again."
5,Overview of Healing with Sounds with Practical Instructions,"The first part of the book provides an overview of toning and harmonics as practiced, mainly for the purposes of healing, in different cultures: Mayans, Native American Shamans, among Tibetan Monks; as well as use in different esoteric traditions - e.g. Kabbalah, Sufi chanting, Gregorian chanting, etc.This is followed by an entire section on balancing chakras with sound and suggestions for your own experiments with toning."
1,Pernicious nonsense: bad science and bad music.,"I am a musician and acoustician with decades of research in overtones and harmonic structure. My response to ""Healing Sounds"" is a bit like Will Rogers' remarks about President Herbert Hoover: ""It ain't what he don't know that bothers me -- it's what he knows for sure...that just ain't so."" Goldman knows a lot of stuff that just ain't so, and his faulty grasp of science in general and acoustics in particular makes this a regular cavalcade of foolish claims based on inadequate research and an inadequate concept of rigor. Wishful thinking, alas, never translates as science."
5,Excellent work...where's the next volume?,"This is an excellent piece written on the American Revolution in the southern colonies. And it begs a sequel.The book is very well written and includes details from some in-depth, original research. I also enjoyed the descriptions and maps of engagements that other books only mention in passing.If you have an interest in the fighting in the south during this war, don't miss this book."
2,Worst in the Series,"If you loved the first five movies of this series, you'll be disappointed with this one. It is awful. The action sequences are nothing like, or comparable with those in the other movies. If Itto Ogami used his sword a bit more rather than the guns in the baby cart, with unlimited ammunition no less, this would be a better film. Also, the story is very disjointed and extremely hard to follow, unlike the previous Lone Wolf and Cub movies. Very disappointed with this."
2,crappy poster wanna-be,"this in not an original poster, it is a copy of one. you can see the fold marks in the picture."
3,Quick ship and good customer service for hard to find item,"This is an unusual laptop brick -- the universal adapters do not work for the computers that need it. So I appreciated that the vendor shipped the very affordably priced item very promptly. Curiously when it arrived it did not work. I contacted the vendor and they offered to replace it immediately. However, when I tried it again the next day, it worked just fine and it has been good ever since."
2,Cheaper Toshiba replacement,"I bought this product several years ago to replace my wife's original cord for her laptop. The original AC adapter went bad after 3 years considering the abuse it went through in her last year of college. The original equipment from Toshiba cost over $80 at the time and this replacement seemed a viable option at the time of purchase. Sadly, this product did not last for more than 3 months. The outer insulation covering came separated from the housing and both sides and also at the outlet prong. I never returned the product because I needed this as a short-term fix at the time and have bought another laptop since then. The product served its purpose, but my recommendation is if you are planning to use this product do not use it where there is any stress put on the adapter. It will serve its purpose if you are the type of person who leaves your laptop set on you desk. Simply put, I got what I paid for at the time."
1,Cord insulation broke after less than one year,I have had this adapter for less than one year and the insulation on the power cord has broken in two places already. Clearly not very well made.
2,"Cord Pulled out, had to tape it up!","I ordered this AC Adapter for my Toshiba Qosmio Computer, since the cord had been damaged on our original adapter. The product works fine and is still working fine. However, the cord running from the box to the wall was not attached properly or maybe the material covering the cord is not flexible enough, for the covering pulled back, exposing the wires inside on both ends of the cord: where it attaches to the box and where the plug attaches to the cord. We have taped it up finally, after using it for a long time with the wires showing. But it works fine. Just looks bad now! I didn't think it worth the effort to send it back, as it works."
3,"Some lesser, some vintage Howard","True, while not a collection of Howard's very best, there's good stuff in here. ... And there are some good, but flawed pieces.Black Canaan - A story of back-woods blacks being led to rise up and kill a lot of back-woods whites, by an evil conjure man who seeks to make himself ""king,"" and his supernatural femme fatal assistant. Howard's racist streak is nowhere more apparent than here, which is ashame, since this is a truly well-crafted horror-adventure yarn. Lots of great atmosphere and creepy imagery.... And no one writes about ""the horrors of the pine-lands"" quite like Howard!"
5,Simply Excellent,"Veith can write with the best of the serious academics, yet his prose is never dull or tedious. Here, in a fairly brief volume, he simply, concisely, and energetically unpacks the fullness of the Gospel, tying it to its glorious past while applying it fully to the problems of today. Pastors, teachers, and other church workers will benefit from its reading while the average ""person in the pew"" or even ""enlightened enquirer"" stand to gain much from this book."
5,Easy to understand,Written by a lay person who frames the Lutheran theology and how it applies to our existence and our spirituality in an easy to understand manner.
5,Learning about Lutheran theology,"Excellent discussion of Lutheran theology from a profesor of English who takes us on his own spiritual journey that ends with Lutheranism. He favors a Missouri Synod approach, but his thoughts about faith and grace, redemption and sanctification helped me to put my Lutheran faith into perspective. Dr. Veith draws distinctions between Lutheran thinking and both ""evangelical"" and ""catholic"" views without being negative about them. I recommend this book to anyone who has questions about Lutheran beliefs who want an easy reading answer. The book is NOT a dogmatic treatise and is suitable for new believers. It could also be very useful for small group or catechetical instruction."
4,This CD is wicked!,"this builds on their debut ablum, but is more complete. great beats and melodies and georgeous vocals. a cocky, suggestive style that doesn't take itself too seriously. if you like any trip hop or drum and bass stuff you will really enjoy this excellent cd"
4,"quirkable, slamtastic funk","Yeah. oh yeah. Moloko. oh yeah. Moloko be the capital of the planet electro-funk. Don't be fooled by the single, cuz that isn't what moloko is all about. They have some hooks, but what they really got is some new wave soul. oh yeah. Flavor: Chutney refried beans (minus the cilantro)<<<you can't get this easily, but buy it import, and you will have reason to order more>>>"
1,Very soft rubber,The racket is very light and the rubber is very soft and feels very different from my previous ones. The rubber does not provide much spin either. Not recommended.
3,"My first pen racket, and I don't like it","I am a beginner pen style table tennis player. I wanted a pen style racket and this was the only one that was priced within my budget. After a few weeks of play, I went back to my old racket. The racket is too light and it takes a lot of force to hit the ball. Not the same rubber as advertised. Overall, not bad if you just want to try it, but it is not something you want to use regularly."
3,"Although it's not design for high skill players, it's good for beginner.","Although it's not design for high skill players, it's good for beginner. Especially, at this price."
5,I recommend this book.,"A very entertaining look at the history and personalities of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, at one time or another, home to 14 or more Nobel laureates. Learn how the Institute was created and how Einstein was recruited to be it's first member. Meet Godel, von Neumann, Dyson, Oppenheimer, Pauli, Witten and other luminaries up close and personal through their years at IAS, a place where these great minds have had no other duties or responsibilities than to explore new frontiers of thought and imagination. A very interesting look at the exotic, quirky, and sometimes downright nutty personalities of some of the greatest figures in science. A fast-paced read that I never found boring. Martin Gardner also gave it high praise."
3,A bit disappointed,"The title was very catchy, and with the photos of 4 geniuses - Einstein, Goedel, von Neumann, and Oppenheimer - on the cover one could be pardoned for having high expectations from the book.Not a bad read but this is just an average book, and reads more like a journalist trying to put together the best he can about the various esoteric topics (this was 1986) being worked on at IAS and the personalities. The topics are either too many or too short, and run abruptly from one to the next.A book of this kind, talking about an institution, should not cover too much about the topics themselves such as spin, fractals, superstrings, but focus more on how IAS has enabled the scientists to create such original things. Such a book should have many photographs of the building, rooms, people at work and also the personalities themselves. This book does not have a single photograph, beyond the cover photo, so it does not bring out the human element that well."
2,appallingly gushing and fawning,"I confess that I only read two chapters of this book before I decided that it was all that I could take.Yes, Princeton's IAS was a place where extremely talented scientists congregated. All the same, what I read of this book was almost pathetic in the degree that the author doesn't as much describe the scientists there as people, as make them out to be a variety of superheros who must be described in adulatory, even groveling terms, an insult to their memories. Nor did I learn anything new - either in terms of science or biography - from the chapters I read; even worse, it was clear to me which books some, if not many, of the passages came from.I wouldn't recommend this book."
4,music CD,"Bought this for my husband. Only place I could find Cowboy Copus ,it is an old country singer. He loved it."
4,Should have paid attention,This purchase would have been top quality had I paid attention when I placed my order and purchased the CD and not the cassette. I don't even have a cassette player in my house. I did find one so that I could listen to the songs I needed on this release. Otherwise this is a really great product.
3,vespa,lunapop generally is depressing but the vespa song (aka 50 special) kicks so much face as it is very snazzy. i would really like a vespa in case you feel the need to purchase one for me. thanks very much! vespas rock. too much rock for one hand!!!
2,A few decent songs,This CD set is collecting dust on a shelf somewhere. I listened to it twice. I'm glad it was recorded.
4,Very pleased and thankful,"I'd give this recording 3-1/2 stars. The music and lyrics are not perfect, and if this were a recording of an on-stage version, I'd question the casting of Faith Prince as the lead role. (Maybe it's just hard to escape the idea of Audrey Hepburn in that role.) But the music and lyrics, while not perfect, are intersting, with many interesting and successful moments; I find myself humming the songs hours later, without thinking about it. Definitely an addition at least for collectors of musicals."
1,Not so hot.,"This book is disappointing, it is hard to pinpoint but somehow this book defeats itself in its attempt to encourage reading. Maybe in the part about red hot eyebrows or later but whatever the case I would read this thoroughly before buying."
5,Dr. Suess Book,We bought the book for our youngest son. Dr Suess books are great for beginning readers. We bought several others as well.
5,Booze throws him down the slippery slope,"I love this movie as an adult. Tyrone Power always delivered strong performances and he was exactly what a Hollywood actor should be and was part of the reason that the old movies was a great movie environment to grow up in when the Seventies and Eighties in America were so stylistically appalling. The movie is dishy, way better than watching an episode of Intervention."
5,CARNY LIFE AS A SURREAL MORALITY TALE,"Tyrone Power was a beautiful man. Almost too beautiful. His casting as the lead geek (literally) in NIGHTMARE ALLEY is all the more daring because of the subject matter. The dark side -- was there ever a bright side? -- of carnival life visualized as a gothic, almost surreal, mindscape.The noirish elements are all here: The shadowy, alternate world; the ever-shifting morality; the desire for redemption but the selfish choices; the too-late discovery that there's no way out. And of course, the tough dame (Joan Blondell) that initially triggers the descent into hell. It's Power's best performance (here under director Edmund Goulding).There's a sometimes searing, honest perversity to this great morality tale about the traveling freak show in which we all reside."
2,A Really Creepy Film,"This is one of the darkest, most depressing and creepy films I have ever seen. After watching this, I almost wanted to take the dvd outside my house and set it on fire.However, it does seem to support very well the old (and true) saying that ""Booze is the Nuclear Weapon of the Devil""The characters portrayed in this movie are in serious need of Christ's Salvation"
1,"Very disappointing DVD....Good film, terrible quality","NIGHTMARE ALLEY is a neat and memorable film noir. One of Tyrone Power's most interesting performances. Unfortunately, it arrives on DVD in a fairly battered and grainy transfer that doesn't bode well for future Fox film noir releases. What a shame.Fox sat on their noirs for so long. Licensed some key titles out to other companies because they didn't care. I guess they woke up and smelled the coffee after Warner Bros. stellar Film Noir boxed set (of which another is heading our way in but a few weeks), but to release NIGHTMARE ALLEY in such shabby condition really insults the film and those who love it.Fox: Take a cue from Warner Bros. and Paramount (the two studios that do the best transfers) and get a better handle on your mastering.I'm really sorry I bought this. It's no better than what I recorded off the air."
4,If the censors could have shown the full story,"I am colored by my recollection of the original novel when I saw this again. Story contained adultery,hot sex, incest in the spiritualist scenes, murder, degradation, hallucinations and madness,and did not have a redemptive ending. Powers did a fine job in this movie for the scripting of that era. (I am amazed that Zanuck let him take off his tights and rapier after making Captain and Castile a so so adaptation.) I bet it was a battle to get the role and show he was a fairly good actor. It is worth watching as part of the noir history. Not the best. My personal best in the genre is still the film ""Brute Force,""which has some of the meanest streets before Quentin Tarantino was even a gleam in mom's eye..Alley is worth the cheap price."
5,One of the great classic films,"This was a very different role for Tyrone Power, and he handled it with perfection, proving his depth as an actor. Good movie, good cast."
1,Out of date,"It's a great idea, but I'm disappointed with this book. Half of the stores I attempted to visit during a recent trip through the Northwest were no longer in business or had moved."
4,Love or Loath Her you always find yourself listening,"one thing about Madonna then as now She has never been lost with words on People,Places,&things.She has always had something to say on everything&everyone.I applaud Her for being Herself no matter what.interesting quotes through the years from her."
5,Almost too nice....,"This sword was received as a Christmas present to complete a collection of Civil War reproductions. The etching on the blade is deep and sharp. The plating on the guard is smooth and lustrous. Over all, this sword far exceeds my expectations. For the price it can't be beat (I'm guessing at TWICE the price it can't be beat)."
2,Ho Hum,"This is one of the few books that I have read that I can honestly say I did not like at all. The characters were uninteresting, and the story was slow and senseless. The plodding pace had me stopping frequently to try and remember what I had just read. Since I read this book in 1990, I have made a concerted effort to avoid Lewitt's books."
1,awful,"I really wanted this machine to be a great basic sewing machine. Unfortunately it is being returned. The instructions are horrible and the illustrations are both blurry and confusing. I can only get the bobbin to work 1 out of 10 tries so after reading the instruction manual repeatedly, I am returning it.I guess you get what you pay for! This is a cheap machine, and it certainly isn't worth the effort trying to make it work!"
1,Negative,"I purchased my machine in 2005 and used it once shortly after I purchased it. I finally got it out to do some mending and hemming and it broke on the third item I sewed on it. The wheel on the right (designated as wheel on the diagram) has fallen apart. Really bad considering I had my Kenmore machine for 25 years, through making all the clothing for my four children, not to mention drapes, pillows, etc. and never had any problems. The cost to ship this machine back to the factory will cost almost as much as it will to buy another brand of sewing machine. I'm very disappointed."
2,Frustrated to no end....,"This machine was given to me second hand a few years ago. I have fought with it ever since. Thread will not stay threaded. Things are constantly getting jammed, and taking the bobbin in and out can be time consuming and confusing. Then today, it just stopped.... I have taken the machine apart, cleaned it, oiled it and done everything imaginable but nonetheless, though the light still comes on and the engine revs when you hit the pedal, nothing will move including the hand turner wheel.I am so upset! The manual is a joke, and 'shark' seems to have no internet presence where I can find help.So all in all, I am mostly upset that I'll have to purchase a new machine, though I'm excited to finally have something that works."
5,Rom Reaney's Mazatlan Connection,"I wish to spend a few months in this part of Mexico, Mazatlán, in winter. I's why I want to by this book"
3,good but pricey,its a great unit and made in the USA and i paid more for that just i know what is it and they would even make money at 50-60$ so a bit pricey but i would recommend it
2,"Works great, but that bag is a piece of $&!#","I've had two of these things now and both times it was the bag that went first. And it's useless as a vacuum without the bag. The zipper is WAY too flimsy for this application and it gives out almost immediately. And it's hard to find a replacement bag. If you do buy one, save the broken bag and send it back to them for a warranty repair and see if that works. For me, I'll look for a better brand."
2,BAD Mistake,"I bought this product recently and was so disappointed I threw it away without even trying to send it back. I used the blower vac two times and had to pull the start cord so many times I can,t even count. I have had about four blower-Vacs in the last twenty years and know how to use them.I thought Troy built made good products however I was mistaken. I almost had a heart attack trying to start this machine.Think twice before buying this product."
2,need some improvements,"I bought this because of the TroyBIlt name. The blower works fine and the vacuum does an o.k. job but the bag sucks! It doesn't hold very much and is impossible to empty. The unit is also quite heavy, after an hour of use my arms ache. If they could fix the bag issue it would be a much better product."
3,it works,"I bought this item for my husband. He however hates it. It is extremely big, and the bag inflates at the bottom, making this very hard to use!!!"
1,Don't buy this product,"I followed all the instructions. However, it would not start. I kept trying for several days but still nothing. I did get it to start but it only ran for about 5 minutes then stopped and would not start again.Very frustrating. Would not recommend this product or anything this company makes. Total waste of money. Will not purchased anything from this company again. I'm only giving it one star because it won't let me continue without at least one star."
1,Fagettabout it - buy another brand!!!!,"The EZ start system is worthless. It took 5 to 8 tries to get it started because it delivers such a weak spin. To top it off the EZ start system broke, rendering it useless at the beginning of the third season of use, less than 24 hours of total running time. Stay away from any EZ start type of system. Stick with the tried and true rope pull."
2,it didnt last for me,i thought to my self if this item would last for two months. It would pay for itself.I've used it 3 times now engine wont start!
1,Don't bother,"I purchased this from Amazon brand new but as soon as I saw the box I could tell this was anything but.It had been re-taped so many times (open and closed) and torn all over.First the vacuum attachment was missing. I decided to try it any way.Well, the blower sucks. You're better off getting a blower attachment for your weed trimmer. And the vacuum is useless. You have to hold it over a single leaf and hope that it will eventually gets vacuumed up. So don't worry about the bag being small. It will never get filled.It is heavier than most other dual blowers/vacuums. And most definitely the loudest one out there.The motor shacks violently. I was actually worried it might explode or something.I give up. Why can't someone make a good gas vac/blower?"
1,Run Away!,"Don't buy this! The collection bag is the size of a sandwich bag. The blower is pathetically powered, it barely moves the leaves in my lawn. And finally and most importantly, I used it 5 times and it's broken and Northern Tool says ""oh well to bad!"" I am out $150 and have nothing to show for it. Run away don't walk."
1,haven't gotten it yet,"I ordered this leaf blower for my husband as a Christmas present in the second week of November. The order was estimated to be delivered by November 30th and I paid over $16 for 2 day shipping. It is December 6th and the order is still somewhere in Illinois and I am in California. I would not suggest that anyone order this leaf blower as a Christmas gift unless they do not mind getting their package after the holidays. From other reviews this seems to be a good product, but I would not suggest ordering it if you are in a time crunch."
4,Good performer & customer service from Troy Bilt...,"This is a good item for around the yard. By no means a ""pro"" model but easy starter & the vaccum is integrated into the design, not just an add on.After a few months the zipper on the mulching collection bag blew out. (It should use a heavier zipper)I called Troy-Bilt and they quickly shipped me a new bag, no questions asked and it showed up at my door a couple days later. Nice to know that they at least stand behind their product."
4,A Good Information Source,"Majoring in Nursing helped me with deciding the steps to take to see if nursing would be a good career for me. I am currently trying to decide if I should change careers and the book covers nursing as a second career and the advantages and disadvantages to starting nursing at an older age. It also discusses steps to take before putting in all the time on a degree (such as volunteer work) to see if nursing is the kind of job you thought it would be. Details of the different educational paths to an RN are clearly discussed as well as the various types of jobs available in nursing and of course the many problems (insurance, etc)."
4,Great Overview For Career Research,This book is great for those considering nursing as a career. It gives an overview of many aspects of the profession from school requirements to dealing with problems. The best part of the book is the appendix which contains references to books and organizations.
5,"informative, brave, well written","I found this book to be exactly what I was looking for to explain the world of being an RN. The book very clearly states it is for those interested in becoming an RN. Janet covers what it means to be a nurse, skills, brief view of different types of nursing, education requirements, and social/patient activism. I read one of the reviews that said it was turned off by the politics in this book, but I feel that Katz appropriately addressed the need for advocacy both at the patient level as well as a policy level (health care system). If you're wondering 'should I become a nurse?' this book is a good way to help answer that question."
2,"Okay, but...","I quickly grew tired with the author's leftist political views, which she felt compelled to insert in nearly every chapter. And unions? She's all for them, and doesn't seem to understand that there are those that want nothing to do with them. Also, she completely negates those with ASN nursing degrees, relagating them to being slightly above NA's on the nursing food chain. No mention of LPN's at all.Which is disappointing, since I am enrolled in an LPN program, with a goal of becoming a PRN - the care I received at two Spokane hospitals (during the birth of my children) was the turning point of my interest in nursing."
3,Be careful playing all out,"This is a great paddle for making desperate shots. Shots from a distance take a little bit of uumph to get over the net, but its worth having those shots drop right over the net. For up close play its good at returning shots and having them go right where you want them.The one negative I have about this paddle is its extremely weak. I've only had it about a month and I've put several dents in it. The layers of maple cracked on one side and split apart after I hit the table once. So all i have to say is if you're a serious player you probably don't have to worry about hitting the table, but if you're an amateur enthusiast be careful of making wild shots because this isn't exactly the most durable of paddles lol."
1,Not for Serious Players,"ONLY thing good about this racket: the lowest priced Butterfly paddle available. Both rubber and paddle (mainly plywood) extremely weak. The ""Butterfly SHIDO"" name on handle is a cheap looking, removable sticker."
2,Episodes are cut,"I'm a big fan of this series, and I own the previous Blu-ray releases of the first 4 episodes. While this is called ""The Complete Collection,"" it's far from it. The original discs I have are all around 100 mins, while the episodes on this set are all 43:35. More than half the original episodes are gone in these new trimmed versions (please note that some of these episodes were originally 2 hours, and some were 1 hour, so not all are drastically trimmed). I'm so disappointed in Discovery."
2,"The not ""complete"" collection","Don't buy this version is not really complete! I watch the France, China and Italy documentary and there are not complete. The original versions of these documentaries are more than 100 min long. On this version they only last like 40 min!! I suggest buying each individually. Is not fair that they sell us a documentary that says ""complete collection"" on the cover when is not true."
2,Discovery Atlas Redux,"I agree with most of reviews here that these shows are heavily edited. I saw the Brazil Atlas and it was 2 hr on discovery channel with commerical. and if you look at the Brazil Atlas Blu-ray you'll see that it has the running time of 94 minutes too. i really like how the show look at different people of each country so that not only you learn about the country, but its people, culture, and ways of life.I like this show very much- i only got to see Brazil on TV so I dont know what else i miss with the rest of the shows.if you never seen this show, then you'll be amazed and love this series- especially in hi-def, but if you saw them before on tv or stand-alone dvd/blu-ray- you'll be very disappointed... you're missing more than half of the original show!"
5,"Beautiful, stunning series in HD; but the edits are deeply disappointing....","To those complaining that this edition features edited versions of the shows, you're absolutely right! At least four episodes (Italy, Australia, Brazil and China) are heavily edited. I own the original disks for those, and they each clock in at over 100 minutes. But in this new compilation of all the episodes, they are only about 44 minutes long. I'm not sure if the second season episodes (Japan, Mexico, Egypt, etc.) were also edited down to 44 minutes, or if they originally aired at that length.At any rate, it's horrible that Discovery is peddling half-episodes. The beauty of the Discovery Atlas series (beyond its stunning looks) is that it would really explore the lives of the country's inhabitants. You miss a lot of that depth when four or five storylines get truncated into 44 minutes..."
4,Great price = Perfect Small Size,"My daughter injured her knee dancing several years ago. She is very atheletic and plays a lot of sports. She needs to support her knee and have the flexibility to continue to play at her best. These knee supports are perfect for her needs. She is a small person 5'1"" 89 lbs and it is next to impossible to find small knee braces in the brick and mortar stores. We ordered here and got 2 braces for the price of one in a regular store and they actually FIT her. Perfect. She does wear out a brace in about a year from all the use but I see that as normal wear and tear and not as a manufacturing problem."
4,Great Knee Support,I wear these on both knees. I have one bad knee(ski injury and degenerative arthritis). These Futuro Knee Supports are comfortable for walking and running over uneven terrain. One downside; they do not breath well or dissipate moisture. I wore them during a marathon on gravel roads and my knees felt supported and did not get sore or ache during the event.
3,Somewhat provides relief; also made in Taiwan but not USA (as wrongly stated above),"I bought this product for my mother who has pain in her knee when she walks. This product supports the knee and seems to somewhat reduce the pain but, unsurprisingly, does not make it disappear.The quality of the product is good but please note that this knee support is made in Taiwan but not USA as wrongly stated in the product description; hope this misleading sentence will be corrected."
3,"Very cute, picture not accurate","This diaper bag looked adorable on Amazon, but when I received it I was pretty disappointed. The straps looked as though they were brown in the picture, but they turned out to be a faded black denim material. This changed the whole look of the bag for me, and I returned it. It was still a very cute bag, just not the style I was hoping for."
5,An excellent sourcebook,"This book is one of the best books put out by FASA. While there are the usual errors (likely caused by rushing), it is still a very good source of info. It is the perfect complement to the previous Field Manual, that of the Crusader Clans. If you have that book, this is a must-have. The illustrations are great, and the depth of info is engrossing."
4,New York-inspired gardening for everyone,"I agree that Paradise Found is very New York-centric, but I guess I thought that was the point: If you can grow it in a bucket on a terrace in sooty old NYC, you ought to be able to grow it anywhere. I found plenty of great ideas to apply to my desert garden in New Mexico, and didn't feel a bit slighted, geographically. (On the other hand, that Mason-Dixon thing IS a problem.) All-in-all a beautiful book with plenty of great design ideas and a few glaring glitches. Isn't it nice it was discounted?"
5,Very Fun Game For The Kids,My kids have a blast with this game. They like trying to find all of the coins and badges to complete the story. It is a cute game to watch my kids play because it is very kid appropriate all of the time and it has some very funny parts in it as well.
4,Kid was happily entertained for hours.,This was a birthday present for a 6 year old. He was extremely happy with the present and was entertained for hours.
3,"It's fun, but too much down time in between scenes.","I have had this game for a couple of days and after playing it, I have found out the likes and dislikes. The game is funny and somewhat challenging. The thing I don't like about the game is that, in between the different scenes, there is a lot of down time. It seems to take forever to load the next scene. The other thing is that there is a lot of talking by the characters before the scene starts. And you have to listen to this in order to get the information necessary to play the scene. I don't care for games like this. Overall I found the game to be an average one. If it was faster I would have scored it higher. The game would not be for younger ones who can't read yet, although the characters do tell you what to do. Good luck."
3,"so-so, wish it was longer.","Super cute.Even though I am an adult, I love kids games.BUT the game is so short. It took just a few short hours to complete."
2,"Seems fun, but a bit crude for younger ones","Played this game with my young son for a while. Seems like fun, but it wasn't long before I turned it off for the (very unnecessary) crude language it contains. Some of the tasks to complete are pretty difficult, taking me several times to win a race so we could advance. Overall I'd say skip it. It's not for younger kids, and the older kids probably won't be entertained by the basic game line."
3,good but repetitive,"I like the lessons. However, I feel that the introductions are too repetitive. This book has the same introduction to every lesson. They should be more geared towards the lessons."
3,Not as pictured,"This review is meant to give a more accurate description of the product.This cable is 21 ft. However, unlike what the picture shows, this cable is actually not angled. If you're looking for an angled cable, like I was, look elsewhere. I purchased the cable because I needed an angled cable, so I will be returning it.I took 2 stars off due the lack of detailed description and incorrect picture, causing me to spend $5 for the return. As far as performance of this specific cable, I wouldn't know. However, I have been using Monster Cables for years, and they are the most reliable and durable cables in the industry. Pure quality. Also, if you're already looking into Monster Cables, then you already know they make solid products."
2,bla,"This product is suposed to be a very good tool , in theory but unfortunately in rel life is not , the tool will thread fine up to 1' but as soon as you go higher than that the bracket that holds the entire machine will break like a toothpick , and the reason is ,the bracket is made of cast iron and cannot hold the stress created by the machine , bottom line CHEAP, CHEAP. I did not know that and i got a second one and payed 200 more , and and up the same way , now i've got two machines witch are useless ( cant be used without the bracket ), and had to buy the rigid one ( another 600$). Now you do the math."
2,sound quality very poor,"there are some great songs here - ""maintaining my cool"" may be my favorite Sonics number, but the sound quality of this dvd is inferior to my old record with the same content. A real disappointment."
3,Sonics Today,"It's great to see loyal fans from different parts of the country interested in the Sonics after all these years. I'll be sure and tell Dad since he doesn't have a computer, or use for one, they ""didn't need that stuff in the 60's""."
2,School Teacher,"I bought this book to teach a summer school class, hoping it would give me a ton of songs to teach grades 1 through 4. The majority of the songs were not really appropriate for children. There were a lot of suggestive phrases that I did not want to be responsible for teaching a first grader. I took only a few things from the book to use in my class."
1,more like a newsletter than a magazine--SO disappointed,"It took 4 months and multiple inquiries for the first issue to arrive. The June 2012 issue had 22 pages total. Seriously? For $32 a year, they dare to send a 22 page issue. The ""articles"" sound more like press releases from companies mentioned in them. There were 2 pages of recipes, again supplied by companies/trade associationsA total rip off. DO NOT order this. I am so disappointed--I listed this on my Amazon wishlist and received it as a gift. I hate that my friend wasted money on this crap."
3,Not Quite as Pictured,As a new pool owner we're thrilled with anything we can use in the pool. This float is good for sitting up and visiting with another person. It did bother me that it was not the same colors as pictured. The one pictured is much prettier...the one we received is a white and green so it really stands out instead of blending a bit with the pool water color.
1,for small people,"This float looked like a lot fun, however, it's very small. There is not much room for each occupant. Only our butts were in the water, we really could not relax in it. The float made us sit up bolt upright. Feet barely touching the water. The ""cooler"" is useless."
4,Good follow up,Good to see Kim was happy.Shonda got what she deserved.She should have thought about the way she got Malik.She couldn't possibly think it was gonna be all lovey dovey for the them.At first I didn't think Nadine's character fit.It took her so long to come in the picture.It's a good follow up to Got A Man. I'd Recommended it
2,Left me hanging...,"Maybe I should have read ""Got a Man"" first...but this book left much to be desired. And I was expecting just a bit more from Ms. Poole. The characters were like cardboard...and more could've been done with the storyline. And the end...well, let's just say a whole lot more could've been done with the end too.Definitely wasn't a ""page turner"", but it did give me something to occupy my time during the morning commute on the train. I've read other books by Ms. Poole...so I'm not giving up on her yet!"
1,A Forced Read,"How did this author become an Essence Bestseller???!!! I bought this book at Walmart for $2.97, to read while waiting on the books I ordered from Amazon. Needless to say, I want a refund. First of all, in the very first paragraph, she was repeating herself. This story reads like a 4th or 5th grader wrote it. What should be 1 sentence, is separated into 2 or 3 sentences. It doesn't flow, and it's all chopped up. I have been trying to force myself to read this book, but it's not happening. I read the 5 star reviews, and I'm trying to figure out what they read. Maybe the book will get better, but I doubt if I will find out. This is my first book by this author, and probably my last."
1,To Small,The screen is to small and if you are willing to spend and extra $50 then got to costco and get a 7in screen that plays real dvds. Dont get this junk that will be around for no more than 6 months
1,Misled Description on MINI dvd player,"I bought 2 of these dvd players for my nephews for Christmas. Very disappointed. Was not aware this was a MINI DVD. Hard to use. No instructions for playing regular movies, only scooby doo type cartoons are available in our local charlotte mall. Very Disapointed."
3,"Big clock, too much ""distressing/aging""","Wanted a nice large outdoor clock to hang in my screened in porch. I was specifically looking for one with a thermometer also. This clock is big, 2 feet across. The only thing I don't really care for is the faux ""aging"" or distressing. You don't see it real well in the picture but they try to give this (plastic) clock a worn or aged look and it doesn't really have a good effect. Other than that the clock uses a single double A battery and consequently because the hands of the clock are so big the battery doesn't last too long. A month maybe."
2,"Cool looking clock, but has some quality issues.","This clock looks great, but in the first year I had it, the ""temp"" function stopped working, and one of the hands fell off. My husband was able to take the back off the clock to repair it. However, the clock doesn't always keep good time, and the white ""face"" of the clock has warped somewhat. I'll need to replace this.......what use is a clock that doesn't keep good time.......and I won't be buying the same one."
3,not black,"specifically searched for a black clock...but this has that aged bronze thing going on, and even the numbers are brown. face is cream colored. not as pictured. if you like that kind of look, the clock is beautiful and priced well for it's large size."
2,Don't waste your time / $$$,"This ""book"" is really a compilation of fan-type magazine articles. Very, very thin, nothing in- depth here. Some good photos in a large format."
4,Torture you ears for fun!,"This is a great very brutal death metal album. If you want death metal similar to Origin or Mortician with solid Christian lyrics, look no further."
2,This ain't no Hanon,"I've now got both ""Blues Hanon""s and am disappointed with this one as well in it's own way (see review of the other). By contrast this one is not a Hanon at all by which I mean exercises in all keys each focusing on a specific technical problem, which at least the other one was in format.This book is more of an introduction to blues piano and has some material of possible value but the ""exercises"" are essentially a few written out songs that do (to the books credit) focus on a particular technical issue. The songs are in different keys but not even passing mention is made of how to turn them into multi-key exercises.I'm almost frustrated enough to create my own and I no doubt will create at least as subset for my own use now (...) I will get a little from each of these ""Hanons"" but I wouldn't recommend either if a ""Hanon"" is what you seek. This particular book can serve as an intro to blues piano for those in search of such."
5,about a lessons,I am very satisfied of this book.I am a pianist and i found everything what i need it to learn the basik of bluse.I have just one problem.I would like to order many book sheets from this webside.Is it posible to pay by cash on delivery and how?Thank you in advance.Sincerely yoursDori
2,A Whitewashed General History of the Vietnam War,"Lieutenant General Davidson (ret.) does a great job summarizing and analyzing the French war in IndoChina from 1946-1954, but fails miserably with the US campaign of 1965-1967 of which he was a part (as USMACV J-2, senior US intelligence officer in Vietnam). The author is a major apologist for General Westmoreland. Also, too much of the book centers on Washington politics rather than operational matters (which is a shame, he could have shed much light on the intelligence picture in the crucial 1967-8 campaigns). Davidson ignores the crucial Battle of Ap Bac in 1963, the Son Tay Raid, My Lai massacre and the participation of allies (ROK, Australia). The Crucial Tet campaign is glossed over - he never mentions the bloody Battle for Hue. The author is far too political and seems intent to present a white-washed ""history"". Maps are somewhat crude but plentiful and accurate."
5,Guidebook for the mind,"Excellent historical and cultural introduction to the fountainhead of civilization. Great information on self-conducted walks filled with photographs, dates and erudite summary. The perfect companion to the intelligent visitor, or even resident! The only drawback to this atypical guidebook is precisely that; to those looking for where to eat, and which nightclub to go, look at the LetsGo."
2,"Pretty and interesting, but not particularly useful","On a recent trip to Italy, we used four Knopf books (Italy, Venice, Rome and Florence). Each was lovely and beautifully illustrated. While they contained wonderful historic information they were pretty much useless for our travels. They contained little in the way of useful and practical information. I'll try Fodor's or others for future travels."
1,Garbage,"I guess you get what you pay for. It was advertised as ATA, no mention of SATA-only connection. I didn't mind buying a SATA adapter separately, I needed one anyway, but this new HD spun up for about a second, then completely died. Even though the price was good, it's not worth the shipping to send it back. If the company was legit, they would provide a replacement."
1,Not Labeled Correctly,This product was not labeled correctly. It is labeled on amazon as an ATA hard drive but when I recieved the package I found out that this hard drive was not an ATA after all it was really a SATA. They have different types of connections and any smart business would have thought to double check that for quality assurance purposes before letting it be sold to the public. I am dissappointed in the lack of quality assurance on the part of the company Mt Sac Student Book Sales.This might very well be a good hard drive but it was the wrong type. I ordered an ATA and not a SATA and to find out this fact only after I placed the order is BS.
4,"Good, but....","This is a fairly solid album and is very well done. BUT if you have Death to the Pixies than this album has little to add. A few tracks are notable such as ""Winter Long"" and ""Into the white"" Also some of the single versions are interesting to listen to, but not worth buying again for many repeated tracks. Instead of buying this, buy Death To The Pixies and go download Winter Long and Into the white of iTunes or something."
3,Defective CD,"The label 4AD has acknowledged that on these discs the beginning of the song ""Hey"" has been cut off. They plan on correcting this on future discs but have no plan to recall the defective discs that are already out there. Don't buy this disc until this has been corrected."
5,"Alternative music that is smoth but has a ""hard rock"" flare",I really enjoy the Pixies and I believe they are one of the many unappreciated artists in the music world. Their style is unmistakable and has the perfect blend of alternative and hard rock sounds!
5,Great band,"I don't have much to add. The Pixies are an awesome band and this is a nice representative sampling of their work. It's pretty easy to hear their influence in a lot of popular bands that came after them, namely Nirvana."
5,"you can't live without The Pixies, you just can't!","This is a great deal and a beautiful CD. The songs have the power to completely change your mood. Favorites: ""Where is My Mind,""--sad and gorgeous song! ""Monkey's gone to heaven,"" equally fantastic, ""Hey."" Anyway, this is pointless--I love just about every song. Get it and you'll get into it."
4,where is my...the happening?,"It's pretty much impossible to go wrong with any Pixies songs, but I must say it's imperative to go out and buy the albums, especially Bossanova because it was ridiculously slighted here. I can understand only putting 3 songs from that album on here (although I'd put 7), but I don't understand how they could have picked ""Dig for Fire"" over ""The Happening"" (which is far and away the best song of all time, I'd say. Well, maybe not far and away, but you know.) and ""Havalina"". Also, no ""River Euphrates"" and no ""Cactus"" from Surfer Rosa. Still, Pixies songs are Pixies songs, and this is a decent place to start, although any of the middle 3 albums would be just as good to start with (Surfer Rosa, Doolittle, Bossanova)."
2,Poor mastering on first song?,"Does noone else's copy of this cd have a very present static throughout the entire song ""Bone Machine""? I returned my first copy and the replacement has the same problem. The rest of the cd is great!"
3,Enjoyable but not fundamental,"I bought this album because I read a few ""best of"" lists from Pitchfork and Spin that listed the Pixies as one of the best bands of the late 80s and early 90s. I'd never heard their stuff, so I thought I better check it out.The album has a number of catchy songs and I'm happy I bought it, but the critical adulation seems misplaced. All the songs sound pretty much the same. Musically, the band strikes me as one more variation on a long history of stripped-down garage rock combos from the Violent Femmes, Gang of Four, X, the Ramones, all the way back to Buddy Holly. Lyrically, they're not going for much beyond sly disaffection. Download the MP3's for a few songs like ""Here Comes You Man"", ""This Monkey's Gone to Heaven"", and ""Gigantic"" and you'll pretty much understand the Pixies and their place in pop music."
1,"Started to Order This, But...","I started to order this. I really did. The Pixies ain't bad. I was also going to see them when they were coming to Israel this year. But then they cancelled, part of the 'cause du jour' of boycotting Israel. What a shame. Thousands would've come to see them perform...well, so much for that idea. And so much for me putting any money into Pixie pockets. Sad."
4,Best of Pixies' Best,"The only criticism that I would have about this album is that the Pixies don't need a ""best of"" album. Their albums are strong enough on their own that I would recommend purchasing Doolittle to get an introduction to their music. Then you won't have to question whether to buy another album due to purchasing the same songs twice."
5,Exploring the person beneath the director!,"Bergman's island is a haunting, incisive and accurate portrait of this reminded genius of cinema.Through three brilliant sections, Bergman confesses himself before the camera. He reveals unknown aspects, livings and anecdotes that surrounded and nurtured his huge and transcendental artistic legacy.A crucial testimonial of his immortal greatness and supreme conviction as artist and also as human being, including his own particular demons.Unmissable for those hard fans of the big cinema and new young directors."
2,title,Nothing special about this. If your going from XP to Vista only buy this if it is cheap. You will not learn much. Mine came from Smokey Mountain books (150 miles) at a slower than slow time. Stay away from this vendor!
5,One of the Best,"I think everyone will agree that there are tons of dog magazines out there but this one really stands out from the rest. The articles are about a wide range of interests and present different views on things. Anyone with an interest in dogs would really enjoy this. Some o;f the articles are a little more in depth and scientific than others that may just be simply informative or for fun. There are things that really make you think, about the world we're living in or the newest technology that is being developed to tell us new things about things we THOUGHT we knew."
1,Awful magazine,"I hate this magazine. It is so animal rights centered its ridiculous. They also appear to be anti balanced training and only pro purely positive. If thats what you like, great. Have at it. But I found this it to be irritating to read and fairly useless, and extremely expensive for what you get."
5,Magazine for real dog people.,"Bark magazine is great! It has stories about real dogs and real dog issues. I don't like some other dog magazines because they are aimed at breeders and are all about purebred dogs. Bark is for the everyday dog owner and lover. I volunteer as a foster home for dogs and this magazine helps me keep up on issues related to dogs, health problems, training methods and new products. I love it."
3,not timely,I ordered this magazine on February 5 and received the first issue on April 5. Unfortunately it was the February/March issue that I had already read. It was not helpful to read articles about Valentine's and see offers for things that had passed.
3,No comment,"Yes, I received the first issue, but I had already bought it over a month previously to receiving this issue (in other words, they sent me an old issue). I wrote to tell them to extend my subscription by one more issue and I didn't receive any response back. I subscribe to a lot of magazines and have subscribed to several for many years. When a relationship starts off this way, that would be enough reason for me not to resubscribe. And now I should have received the next issue, which is the current month issue, and I have not. The magazine is good, I would rate it 3 1/2 stars. The service gets 3 stars."
5,This Magazine isn't for PETA folks,"This magazine celebrates and explores the relationship between owners and their beloved dogs. You won't find anti dog-owning propaganda here, just articles about regular folks with their regular (often purebred) dogs. It's almost fashionable to own mutts these days but one dog is very different from another. One size does not suit all. I find it very refreshing that this magazine touts the very special reasons that different dog breeds were developed in the first place. I recommend this magazine to all who love dogs of any breed."
1,Frustrated with their customer service,"We received this magazine as a gift from my sister-in-law last year for Christmas. Well, we got a total of two issues and nothing else. When I went to their site see what the status of our subscription was, I was informed that there is a""credit hold"" on the subscription, even though my sister-in-law had already paid for a full year. Now they're saying that if we want the remaining issues, that WE need to pay $10. I don't understand the rationale behind this, and have received no response to emails asking if we are ever going to get our remaining issues. While I think that this magazine is interesting, I think that because of all the hassles, I will not renew this subscription and just chalk this up to a start-up magazine that doesn't know what they are doing."
4,Good Sturdy Machine,I have not had a problem with this machine yet but I have only done one project with it. The instructions are fairly good and have pictures to try and explain the steps. It is nice that it comes with a case because that will run you $20. The auto-thread is nice but the instructions were hard for me to understand. I found a website that had better instructions and I got it right away. I would recommend this to someone.
3,great up until now,"This machine served me well for about six months, but recently the top thread has been getting stuck in the bottom bobbin, jamming the whole machine. Upon doing some internet research, I discovered that this is a common problem with this model, but I was unable to find a solution. Like I said, I had no problems up until this point, and really liked the machine, but now I'll most likely be stuck paying an exorbitant fee to get it fixed."
4,Good Workout,"My husband and I purchase this after spending few weeks on the first power 90 dvd. The workout is almost the same as the first one,more repetition though and a little harder. I lost a few pounds with it (not so successful on my part) but my hubby lost about 40 lbs.He did follow the diet religiously though. I can say that this is a good workout for people who are starting to get back into shape."
4,Challenging every time!,"This workout is very challenging. It consists of sequenced basic cardio moves such as jumping jacks, various leg kicks, punches, etc. There is even a round of Power Yoga at the beginning, following stretches. You really break a sweat with this one! I find myself having to slow down and I am a fairly advanced exerciser. However, Tony Horton, the instructor, is a little annoying and has a way of mildly teasing the individuals doing the video along with him. I also find that this workout is so repetitive and boring that I couldn't bring myself to stick with the 90 day program. Ninety days of doing the same moves with no fun involved? I think I will stick with The Firm, but this workout is great when you want a little change once in a wihle. I would recommend for those that don't care about variety. I danced for years, so this is simply too basic for me."
4,Power 90 Sweat Cardio 3-4,"Although I successfully completed the P90X series, I was looking for other cardio routines instructed by Tony Horton. I decided to try Power 90's phase 2 (Sweat Cardio 3-4) and was not disappointed. It was made apparent to me that Tony's precursor to P90X is what gave that series its motivating edge. P90 Sweat Cardio 3-4 gets your heart pumping, burns 100s of calories and leaves your workout clothes quite soaked with sweat. Also, the workout time is only about 45 minutes and it fits great into my schedule. I'd recommend this DVD to anyone who wants an effective workout."
4,Love it,This is one dvd that will make you sweat I love it .I work with this one every other day it is great .
3,Hawkwind - 'In Your Area' (Griffin Music),"Since Griffin had come back in business,this was their first new release.A mix of new studio cuts,unreleased tunes and a few old songs performed live.Guest vocalist Capt. Rizz sings sort of a rap number ""Hawkwind In Your Area"" that is sandwiched between a decent version of ""Brainstorm"".A new song ""Rat Race"" is played in the middle of a modern day Hawkwind classic ""Love In Space"".Two long-lost Bob Calvert gems are here,the fantastic ""Aerospace Age Inferno"" and ""First Landing On Medusa""(actually it's a reworking of ""the Awakening"").I was decently impressed with most of the new tracks like ""Your Fantasy"",the tripping ""Hippy"" and ""Luxotica"".Founder Dave Brock and new guitarist Jerry Richards both display plenty of good keyboard work on this twelve track effort.Better than their disc that came out just before this title,'Distant Horizon'.Good space rock with last power.Check it out."
1,How the mighty are fallen,"What has Dave Brock done since about 1992? The answer - getting quite a number of people with very little talent into Hawkwind, taking them down the route of bad reggae, idiotic and illiterate raps filled with ecological/political cliches etc..this is not an album that will impress the serious Hawkwind fan, who prefers original musicians of quality to today's sad latecomersWell, this album has two high points, the beautiful instrumentals 'Prairie' and 'Diana Park', but suffers terribly from poor track indexing (some cuts run together -and I don't mean segueing).Come on Dave - get people of the quality of Simon House back into the group and start making real music again."
3,Another release from the definitive kings of spacerock.,"Another Hawkwind release. Just what you needed, eh? As per usual, there are some live tracks, some remakes of old tunes, rewriting of old tunes and plenty of new tunes. Space-pace rock with a touch of world-beat thrown in, oscillators spiralling like audio spacehips, and passages of psychedelia intersperse the compositions. I had the unfortunate pleasure of seeing their performance at the Strange Daze space rock fest in 1998 (the same line-up as this release), when Dave Brock and Ron Tree weren't allowed in the country. The rest of the band performed anyway and it became quite clear that without Brock's iron-fisted leadership, the rest of the band were nothing but filler (except Richard Chadwick's dynamite drumming). An expanded line-up does not always make a band better. IN YOUR AREA isn't bad, but it lacks the drive and cohesiveness of BUSINESS TRIP, ALIEN4 and their best of the 90's, ELECTRIC TEEPEE."
3,A very misleading cover art,"Crash Cinema is my favorite of the generics! They do put outlots of great kung fu films! But I do have to complain about thecover art of this release of Sorching Sun......! The cover artand back art is very misleading! The cover and back shows MingOr Ching or whatever soldiers running around and the same AngelaMao pose Crash uses on a couple of their other Mao releases! Nowwhen I look at something like this, I expect an epic like THEBLAZING TEMPLE, with great costoms and excellent fights! Butwhat I got is just another walk in the park kung fu film! Themovie wasn't bad by any means but I just wish the DVD designwasn't so misleading! Oh well life sux! The movie was ok!Nothing I haven't seen before but whatever! This Crash releaseis in widescreen with imbedded chinese/english subtitles inoriginal language! The picture is watchable with some bleeps andscratches but their hardly noticable!"
2,An all star kung fu cast in a very boring movie,"I usually don't care whether or not a kung fu movie has a good story, but the story is the reason I didn't like this movie. Everybody is looking for a map and it just doesn't make much sense. There are other parts to the story but it is mainly just mindless talking.I suggest just fast forwarding to the last 20 minutes. Dorian Tan, Lo Lieh, Roc Tien Peng, Angela Mao Ying, and Chang Yi all get to show off, and Chang Yi is the only one I felt got enough fighting time. He is on fire in the final fights and he is the only reason this movie is worth watching.2/5The picture quality on the Crash Cinema DVD starts out pretty bad but improves as the movie goes on."
2,Some good tips delivered in an agonizing format and tone,"I read about 1/3 of the book and frankly that was all I could stand of the format and tone of the book. While some of the tips are good, others just sound preachy. They are written in a very absolutist way without a detailed explanation of the author's viewpoint. While it might seem helpful to offer short, easily digestible tips, when you offer 125 of them they become pretty useless. For the number of tips, the author would have been better just to write in a normal book format and spend more time both filling in the blanks of why she believes in the recommended approaches and tying the tips together into broader themes and an overall strategy.There are some good morsels in the book, but the format and tone are too obnoxious for me to handle."
3,Still struggling to copy files to PC,"I recently purchased the Olympus VN-1000 after reading the earlier review that said you could copy files directly to your PC - I'm still trying, but no luck yet. For those of us who are not very tech-savvy, please note that it might actually be worth the extra money to purchase the model with direct USB connection!If anyone has suggestions for me and other potential buyers, please share!"
2,"Good sound, but I got tired of repairs","The sound quality of this device was perfectly acceptable--when it was working. After it refused to accept keyed commands, I sent it back for repair. Yes, it worked for awhile, but now it is not working again, giving weird beeps and refusing to record or play back. I am not hard on electronics, and I follow instructions. This was a real dud. I would send it back, but postage is getting so costly these days, it wouldn't be worth it. I am writing it off as a bad decision."
1,Better off with a rock and chisel,"I'm a professional writer. I perform phone interviews on a weekly basis and this little unit has been the bane of my existence since I bought it. No USB port to import files, extremely difficult-to-use controls, confusing file organization, unreliable operation and about 2 hours of recording time that goes by before you know it. A dud all the way around. Mine just broke down after a year of troubled use, and now I'm going to buy a Sony."
2,Disappointed in quality,"The first recorder I received had a damaged battery compartment door that would not close. As this came in a sealed factory package, I can only assume that this is indicative of Olympus quality. One month after placing my original order, I received the second recorder (retail vendor was very easy to work with, quickly responded to my email complaint). At least the door would close over the batteries on this one. If I had received this one first, I would have given the recorder 3 stars, but averages are averages (and I rounded up). The case is cheap plastic, not very durable. I have my doubts about long-term survivability.Way too complicated except for a techie. But using the basic record, playback, and erase functions are almost straightforward.I would not buy another one from Olympus."
4,Does the job,"I bought this recorder to record home improvement instructions for steps in the project farther down stream - It worked great - I have since used it for other meetings etc. The microphone is decent to my untrained ears - not full of static and noise, like my old microcassette used to be.Otherwise - decent functions, cheap, easy to use.Does seem to eat batteries though,"
3,Good recorder,"This is a standard digital voice recorder, nothing extraordinary about it, but reasonably priced. I bought it primarily to record lectures for school. It caught a lot of unnecessary sounds that seemed insignificant at the time of the lecture. However, I was fortunte to use the recorder to go back and re-listen to all the points I had missed the first time around. My best tip would be to keep the recorder close to the speaker and away from any distracting background noises.The only difficulty I came across with this product had to do with saving data onto it. I often found myself losing track of the older recorded lectures and saw my time limit on the recorder dwindle. Now I have only 4 hours of space, I dont know how since I thought I erased all data on it. I don't blame this fully on the recorder since I did not spend more than 10 seconds reading the instuction manual. So a little time reading it could have solved the problem...if only I can find it now."
5,does the job,"Works great. My screen is cracked due to my wife dropping a coffee mug on it. Batteries don't last as long I'd like, but hey, that's splitting hairs on a simple and very good voice recorder."
2,transferring files,"i'm going to give this 2 stars because of the misleading effect of the reviews, not because of the quality of the product. (sorry). to clarify, in order to transfer the files to your computer, you need to have a sound recorder on your computer. you have to plug the voice recorder into your computer's music jack and play the entire file while recording it with the sound recorder. you end up with the file on your computer, but it's a lot more trouble and time than uploading would be if it had PC connectivity."
2,No good,"It seems I have to get a new voice recorder, since this one has been frustrating me. Three problems. First, sound only comes out of one side of the headphones when they're attached to it, and I have tried multiple headphones so it's not the headphones problem. Secondly, it has now on two occasions spontaneously and unbeknownst to me stopped recording during the lectures I was trying to record, which I only realized later when trying to listen to the lectures. I've now lost a couple lectures of material and the money spent on this thing. Lastly, the batteries that came with it didn't last long. Maybe that was just a problem with those batteries in particular...I don't know since I'm not going to run down the new batteries I put in it because I'm not going to use this anymore. Finally I should say that the box mine came in said it was refurbished. This may or may not have made a difference. I don't know."
5,Sometimes you get more than you pay for,"Considering the price ($22 + $5 shipping), this thing is amazing. Small, long recording time, surprisingly good playback voice quality and adequate volume on its built-in speaker. Simple user interface; even my Luddite wife (who has trouble setting an alarm clock) was able to get it to record, play back and erase. The screen readout is easy to read though the button labels are hard to read without a magnifying glass. Fortunately there aren't many buttons to learn, so you won't need to read the labels after a few minutes of playing with it. It has a flimsy plastic case -- so try not to sit on it."
5,Excellent reminder,"This is an excellent product and very easy to use. It is user friendly. I would recommend this to everyone that has trouble remembering appointments,occasions, telephone numbers etc. It is a must have product."
2,dissapointing,"It is good, but i was dissapointed when the memory was full and I could not erase the lectures i had not listened and record the new ones."
1,Ticked off,"Just finished a review and ""Reviewed"" it. Could not change anything in the ""Review"". Did NOT want my name used. You provided no notice that it would be used nor any way to delete it! Thus, you have my last Amazon sales Review... ever!"
3,Great quality but poor instructions,"The digital recorder has a great quality and I suggest to anyone who wants one to get one. The only issue I had with the Olympus was when I tried to record on another folder, the machine would not record. It kept displaying the message ""Full"" and would not allow me to record. It promises 16 hours of recording but I could only get 4 hours. I had to erase important data to record new data. Again, great quality, poor features."
3,"Neat, but smaller than I imagined","This is a neat little solar system for the price. The photo is kind of misleading, the thing is less than two feet wide and not very bright. Makes a cute little night light though."
4,great visual,I bought this for use in my classroom. It is a good visual for talking about the solar system. My other motivation for purchasing this item was to keep the motion sensor from turning out the lights when my students are testing or when I'm alone and grading. I mounted it a foot away from the motion sensor and use the remote to turn it on when there isn't enough motion to keep the lights on. It works perfectly and since the motion is timed I don't have to remember to turn it off again. I could also see this being a great nightlight for a kids room. It could be left running while a child drifts off to sleep and using the remote a child could easily turn it on again if they are frightened or having trouble sleeping. With occasional use the batteries last about a year.
5,Idaho Exposed - 12 backcountry airstrips,"Maule owner/pilot and photographer/producer Kevin Griffin couldn't have chosen a better guide and backcountry pilot than Herb Milhorn to take the viewer deep into the challenging backcountry of Idaho's canyons. The flying and filming is fantastic with just the right amount of narrative from Milhorn. Excellent also that there are numerous warnings that this is not a training video and that proper mountain flying instruction and skill needs to be acquired before attempting to visit these locations. As a Maule owner myself, the only thing better would have been to utilize a Maule for the flying, but a Skywagon is a good second choice. Very speedy delivery. Can't wait until Utah is ""exposed""!"
4,"Fun video, amazing flying","I bought this for my dad (a pilot who has flown to some of the ""easier"" airports on this video). We got a real kick out of the host and pilot of this video. He's an extremely competent pilot, but sometimes hard to hear. It's an amazing video. He lands in places where it's hard to tell that there is even a runway. I would definitely recommend."
5,Outstanding!,Some jammers I have purchased in the past don't fit well and are thin material. These jammers are great fitting and strong material.
5,TYR Splice Jammer,"A very good jammer keeping me active at swimmingpool as well as the open sea. Comfort and smooth, giving a nice feeling!"
2,Battery Powered!!!!!,You get what you pay for with this product.This product is powered by a AA battery and is not recharged through the USB port (as I thought it did).It came via USPS in a brown envelope stamped with airmail postage from Hong Kong. It DID NOT come in a box or any packaging.
1,DONT buy this junk,You will be sorry! This is the biggest piece of cheap plastic. Very very hard to navigate to what you want.
5,Excellent,"Degrees is a compelling & timely book based upon the importance of what you believe & how the variance of such beliefs, even in the smallest of measures, can make an enormous difference in your ultimate direction & destination. Dr. Waite's latest work takes the reader through the journey of a lifetime by starting with the believer's ""magnetic north"" - the bible and Jesus - describing in great detail how they set the direction for the ultimate decisions in life. He then moves on to how we should live within the community of faith to being a moral compass in a world that lacks spiritual direction. This book has been called a must read by some of the foremost theologians and spiritual leaders in the nation."
5,Great entry level road bike,"I have had no problems with this bike since purchasing it. The only difficulty was that the instructions weren't the most detailed when assembling it. Took me a bit to figure out if I was putting the front brake on right. I would reccomend this bike to anyone looking into road bikes who doens't want to spend $700 or more on a road bike at a bike shop. I added a water cage, spare pump, and a light on the back. Slimed the tires too, which seems to have prevented any of the flats that some other reviewers have complained about. I am 5'9"" and it fits me fine."
5,very well,"i bought this bike recently. it is a great bike and rides real smooth compared to older road bikes. the parts seem high quality and their easy to adjust if needed especially the brake calipers. it took me just a little bit to put it together, but thats because i took my time. if you purchase this bike you will not be disappointed. i haven't rode a bike in years and one of the reasons was to get this bike was to help my diabetes. my first rode trip i was trying to take it easy and end up riding 14 miles. it felt really good i couldn't wait for my next ride."
4,bike,The Bike was a good price.Easy to assemble The only thing I would like to have known when I ordered it was the color.
4,Great bike for the price!,"No, this is not the best bike out there, but it's definitely the best bike for the price!"
2,Not What I Expected,"I had seen of lot of my comments in other reviews, but am nonetheless disappointed. For an item averaging above 4.5 stars, this bike does not meet expectations.The shifters are indeed in an awkward position, and the brakes are only in the lower handles, which is also annoying. Most reviewers comment on being at least 5'9"", and I'd add...don't buy this bike if you're 6' or taller. The petals and most of the time, my feet, hit the ground if you turn sharply.Furthermore, the gear range (14) isn't wide enough...the lower gear isn't enough to climb steep hills and the highest gear isn't enough to sustain pedaling once you have some real speed.Overall, I learned I shouldn't have been so cheap to buy a bike. If you want one, spring for the $400+ bike. The extra $200+ or so is well worth your happiness and willingness to ride the bike."
4,skinny wheels or not skinny wheels,im not actually writing a review but i have a question? are the wheels on this bike considered skinny because i want skinny wheels and im a starter in cycling so i dont know if the wheels on this bike are skinny so can someone please tell me if the wheels on this bike is skinny i would greatly appreciated thank you
4,Great bike for starters!,"So far so good, had it for about 1month and it has delivered good riding quality!"
4,Commuter and first road bike,"I was pleasantly surprised.I'm a college student and I use this bike to commute. It's a little heavy, so going up hills is pretty tough. I'm not a bike fanatic either so having a decent, affordable bike that I could get from point A to point B and maybe run around the university town with was crucial. This bike fit that criteria. This is a great ride, but once I get some money I might go for a better performance bike."
5,Really good road bike,I got this bike for $219.99 and let me tell you that I am really happy with this purchase. It took 30 min to put it together and I didn't have any problems. I really like this bike and I would recommended to everyone who wants to get a good and inexpensive road bike.
4,Great Entry Level Road Bike,"About 7 months ago I was getting into road biking and thought this bike would be a great start. I am 5 10 and this bike fit me pretty well. The frame is a bit longer than other road bikes, but you will not notice the difference if this is your first bike. I have put about 500 miles on this bike and have had very minimal problems. The biggest downfall to this bike would be the lack of a quick release skewer on the rear wheel. This bike is a bit heavier than a more expensive entry level road bike, but again, is a great bike to start out on. I have stepped up to a Bianchi Nirone C2C, and this is now my campus cruiser. Highly recommended for a first road bike. If you are into biking though, I would step it up to the $700+ range."
3,Good environmental view; thin characterizations,"Steve Voien has apparently done his homework to recreate the political and cultural environments that both enhance and plague many African nations, but I had a difficult time getting absorbed in this tale of corruption and murder. One reason is I have no knowledge of French at all, and found it irritating having to figure out the phrases of dialogue written in this language. While I enjoyed Mr. Voien's vivid descriptions of the rain forest settings and the animal life his protaganist, David Trowbridge, and Trowbridge's colleagues come to Africa to study, I could not relate to most of the characters themselves. Trowbridge is fairly well-drawn, but keeping the many peripheral characters that come and go straight was distracting. Overall, it was a unique novel, but I would prefer for Trowbridge to just have done his leopard research and left the humans alone."
4,Good Swiss at a great price,"Swiss cheese received in great condition. This was wheel advertised at 4 - 5 lbs. Ours was 4 1/2 lbs. It is not typical swiss in that it has very samll ""holes"" and a soft texture. Flavor is excellent. We will order this again."
1,maddie,"Very dissapointed. Was expecting a large wheel of cheese. What I got was approximately 1 LB of swiss cheese, 1 LB of cheddar cheese and 6 LBS of BUTTER! How awful this would have been if this order had been a gift. Will never order from this sellar again, and never order any food from Amazon again."
5,Excellent guide for social media!,I thought this was an excellent how to book for online and social media networking. It's broad enough to give every industry a good guide. I'm very new to social media and I found this book to a great resource.I plan to keep this book handy for reference has I move forward. The table of contents is very well laid out to help you get to the specific topic you want to read about.
3,"One of those ""how to network"" books","How to make sense of social network technology? This book talks about technology as well as the human aspects of networking. There is nothing wrong in the description, but the authors don't have any viewpoint. They have just surveyed the area and written a bunch of chapters. I would like to be told what kind of technologies work and doesn't work. If it is too early to tell, I would like a really smart author tell me something surprising. Otherwise I don't want to waste my time.If you haven't read anything on social networks and want a non-technical, very easy read, then this book is for you. Otherwise there is no value-add."
3,Light Escapism,"This light romance requires you to suspend your belief (there's a genie in a bottle, a talking cat, and a sea serpent in this book!), but it's an enjoyable romance. Holly O'Mara is a very likeable heroine. Unfortunately, the hero combines a great body and attractive personality with the tendency to bolt at inoportune moments (he leaves Holly high and dry twice without notice!). A nice, easy to read romance you can take on vacation with you."
3,"This is potentially a great book, but it needs work.","I used this book to teach a class on Energy Resources one year ago. I liked its completeness, and the fact that he used original scientific literature as references. However, many of the problems were undoable with the information given. This was true even in the first chapter and it frustrated the students. The book was also too long for a 1 semester course."
1,ABSOLUTE JUNK,"The majority of the content in this book I took upon myself to blackout, like military censorship. Horrible grammar and input on pop culture. After I told my professor that the Fahrenheit to Celsius and vice versa formulas were wrong we largely stopped using it. I would suggest buying a chemistry, thermodynamics or geology book instead. My energy industry course instilled more knowledge than this oversized coaster ever will. This text is total garbage and should be given away for free!"
5,ONE OF MY ALL-TIME FAVORITES!,"I first heard bits off this album driving down the Pomona Freeway in 1969, or whenever it was, and went directly to a record store and bought the LP! It is a wonderful album (the original)- I love EVERY song on it! Later, I bought a cassette and wore it out, playing it in the car. It's great for driving and singing along.More seriously, it is a vital album in the evolution from Bluegrass into Rock and Roll, via the Burrito Brothers, Byrds (SWEETHART OF THE RODEO), and on to the Eagles, etc. It should be part of the collection of anyone who likes music in this vein."
4,"Easy to understand, filled with partical tips","This is a good book, especially for those that have no prior project management experience. If you are expecting to learn something exta-ordinary, you would be disappointed. This is a book that reminds you what you should do and how you could do to achieve your goal more effectively. All self-help books are like this, and if you could follow the steps and keep them as your habit, you will be success."
3,Ok but not great,This was ok. It did not really soothe/help the dry itchy skin on my legs. My search continues for a product that actually works.
3,"Like the Product, Hate the Service","I really love this product, it works great. I've used it to remove wallpaper, clean hard to reach areas, showers, and much more. The problem is that the Tips/nozzles that come with it wear out very quickly and you cannot purchase them ANYWHERE. If you call customer service, you only get the run-around and no service or help."
2,Wasn't the right item for me,It seems this steamer is meant for removing wallpaper. I purchased it to use for cleaning and it was way too impractical. It's large and unwieldy and takes too long to produce steam; about 12 minutes. The attachments aren't very useful for cleaning and seem cheer. The wallpaper attachment sputters very hot water out of it and it's dangerous. I never used it to remove wallpaper so I can't say if that works or not but I was unimpressed by everything else about it. I returned it and got a refund.
4,steamer,I used this to remove the wall paper from a bedroom. I used it heavily for three days and it did a remarkable job. I used 4 gal of distilled water and had no trouble what so ever. I would recomend the purchase to anyone that asked.
4,Steam Cleaner,"The Wagner 905 power steamer is well worth the money. I got it to clean my kitchen floor grout, & it did a great job. While it isn't quite as labor-free as I thought it would be, it still did the job I wanted it to do, & with less labor than getting on hands & knees with a scrub brush! I can't wait to try it on my outdoor BBQ."
2,Won't Turn On,The few times it was used it worked great but then suddenly it stopped working. fortunatly I should be able to return it to amazon. But if it would not have died I would have been pleased with it which is while I gave it a 2 star instead of one.
4,Easy to use,"Easy to assemble and use. Does a fine job on my tile floors. I guess I expected magic re the tiles in the shower. But overall, I'm very pleased."
2,don't buy for grout,I bought this to use as a grout cleaner.It didn't work very well and I am very disappointed.I read the reviews and was really excited to recieve this item.I used it and was really surprised how inefficient it was and don't understand why the reviews are so high.
5,wagner steamer,"this made life much much easier for our wallpaper removal project. Diff did not work quite as wonderfully as promised, but this did. our wallpaper was truely paper based no vinyl covering, so no need to airate. it worked as promised, just hold it in place a little longer than you think you should. also to minimize drips, i bought a large sponge that we held just an inch or so below the flat steamer to catch run-off. the flat steamer worked on about 95% of our wall. small area's above doors and windows not so much, but the included squegee attachement did fit in those smaller areas. the walls were also old fashion plaster so i do not know if the enourmous amount of heat and steam would damage regular old drywall/wallboard. next mission cleaning the bathroom tile/fixtures/floors and see how it tackles that. i would definitely recommend this product."
5,Fantastic way to remove wallpaper!,We had 4 layers of wallpaper to remove...The Wagner steamer was the perfect complement to the process of using wallpaper remover gel along with fabric softener...Removing wallpaper is definitely a tedious and time-consuming process...There are no shortcuts but the Wagner steamer did help expedite the process!
2,Messy,"I wanted to love this steam cleaner, but I found it cumbersome and messy. Ugh. I didn't have the ""fantastic"" results that others are reporting. I tried cleaning a shower that has hard water residue and it didn't clean it AT ALL. Very time-consuming and frustrating. As for kitchen cleaning, it was too WET to work effectively on my glass-top range. In my experience, this steamer was too messy and too much trouble to lug around. I did not use it on my floors, since they are hardwood and I don't care what anyone says, water and wood DO NOT mix. I returned it and resumed good ole' elbow grease for cleaning. Do not recommend."
2,STEAMER,"IT MIGHT BE A GOOD PRODUCT BUT I PURCHASED IT TO CLEAN MY GROUT,IT DOES BUT VERY SLOWLY AND WITH THE WATER NEEDED A SHORT WORKING TIME.A TOOTHBRUSH AND SOME HYDROGEN PEROXIDE WILL CLEAN BETTER FOR GROUT."
2,Meh,"Flaws:The little attachments are tiny scrub brushes. I tried to use them on grout. The grout shredded them.The ""wait"" light goes on every 60-90 seconds and you have to sit there and wait. This wouldn't be such a problem if I didn't have a 2 year old, but my time is in short supply.You have to wait for it to heat up before you use and and in between fill ups, you have to wait for it to cool down before you refill and wait for it to heat up again. This means about 30-40 minutes in between fill ups.So loud you need to use ear protection"
1,Disappointing,"I didn't use it to remove wallpaper, just cleaning the house I just rented. Although I had read the reviews on the product talking about the low pressure of the steam and the low temperature, I thought it couldn't be so bad. It was. It's not strong enough to remove most of the stains and dirt and it makes you work triple, trying to get rid of them. Today I ended up cleaning the rail of the sliding doors in the guesthouse with the hose, after trying with the steamer for half an hour. Besides, the brushes melt literally the first 5 minutes. Another inconvenient is that is has no place to put away the cable and accesories.On the other side, it's really light, the steam lasts very long and it has an on/off switch. It comes with a screwdriver (for one single screw). It is pretty unexpensive, too.I wouldn't recommend it for heavy duty cleaning but I can't talk about the wallpaper removing tool."
5,Fantastic! And easy to use!,"I bought this several weeks ago, and have used it to strip wallpaper from 3 rooms already!! It really made the job much less difficult."
4,need ear protection for one attachment - defin worth the hastle,"Opened the box happy that my new purchase arived.Easy assembly, couldn't wait to try it out. The floor attachments on the kitchen floor worked like a dream. Next tackeled the shower had to stop right away and get some earpugs the hand held brush attachments is really loud. My cat and dog went into hiding.Once I had my ears protected and door shut between the animals and me. I set to work. I finished the grout and changed to the squeege to finish the tile(the squeege was not as loud). My shower sparkes now. I love my new wagner. I'm going to tackle the kitchen range hood next. :) Well worth the money."
5,best steam cleaner I've tried,"I love this steamer! This is the 3rd steamer I've owned and it by far surpasses the others. The holding tank offers a full hour or more of steam, it puts off a much more powerful burst of steam than other cleaners and all the attachments are wonderful. I love to clean, even if you don't like to clean; this makes cleaning fun!"
4,Great Cleaning Machine!! I love it!!,I did not want to spend the money on something like this but I am glad I did. I does a great job on bathrooms and cleans windows wonderfuly. The one down fall was that it did not take out the small stains in the carpet like I would have liked but it did an OK job. Cleans baseboards with ease. I would recommend this machine. It is a great little cleaning machine!! All the attachments that it came with were very helpful.
5,LOVE THIS THING!!!!,"Cleaning everything with this - Grout, windows, bathrooms, oven, even the ceiling above the stove - the grease is gone!!! Chocolate stains on a cream colored rug...GONE! Can't say enough good things about it."
1,Not really what I thought it would be...,"I thought this machine would be able to clean a bathroom (bath tub, sink, toilet) as others show on TV. It doesn't!! It won't even clean soap stains on my bathtub walls!!! For those who like it, I guess they bought it for a different application... as a cleaning tool, this machine is useless."
3,Great for somethings...,"I'm not sure what I was expecting. It's great at getting caked on dirty off quickly, and it blew the paint of my tile floor. Scrubbing the tub it is not for. My toilet is amazing, but it takes a lot of scrubbing. I don't know if I would have bothered had I know it was going to be this awkward to use. I'll agree with the other reviewers on the need for a handle."
5,Great Steamer,This is a great steamer. Much better than the other hand-held unit I had before. It's light weight and produces a large amount of steam.
5,It made my dingy ancient carpet look new,"This is one powerful steam cleaner. I deliberated for a long time over which steam cleaner to purchase, but I am thoroughly satisfied with my decision. It made my old dingy carpet look like new without any chemicals. My husband has asthma, so clean, as dust-free as possible air is a priority in our home and it does actually seem like the steam killed any dust mites that might have been lurking in our apartment. This cleaner is a great investment for anyone who wants a truly clean home and especially for people who have or live with people who have asthma."
2,"Wagner 905 1,500 Watt Steamer","I had never actually owned a steamer so I read all of the reviews on several websites. The Wagner 905 seem to consistently receive positive reviews. I ordered it and have found it to be much less than I expected. I was looking for something that would make cleaning the shower and the title floor in the kitchen much easier. After about 30 minutes I went back to using some old fashion elbow grease and a scrubber for both. Perhaps my expectations were too high and I will keep the Wagner 905, but I really don't anticipate using it very much."
2,not worth the money,flooded my bathroom counter when I tried to use it...the window squeegee leaks worse than the other attachments...if I could afford to send it back I would in a heartbeat...DON'T BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!
1,send back to China,worked just fair for 4hours and then died. i had bought it 8 months ago and just now got around to using it . so it cost me $20.00 an hour and i still have half a room to go. which means i will rent a machine to finish the job. would i buy this again? not on this side of the nut house.
1,"No pads, poor instructions","This machine is going back before I even try it. It had one small cleaning pad that didn't appear to attach to anything. Originally got it for floors, but it looks more like a wall paper remover."
1,Not worth what I pay for it.,"I purchase this steam cleaner on September. Till this day Oct 31st it wont heat up, no steam comes out of it. ""Waste of money"", my lost and I do not recomend this product to any one."
1,MY TOTAL DISAPOINTMENT,THIS UNIT JUST DOES NOT DO THE JOB. I READ THE REVIEWS BEFORE I BOUGHT THIS AND TO MY DISAPPOINTMENT IT DOES NOT DO THE JOBS IT WAS SUPPOSE TO DO
2,"Wagner 905 1,500-Watt On-Demand Power Steamer and Cleaner",The steam is not hot at all; I can put it directly on my skin and it is barely warm. This machine does not clean around the faucets or anything else for that matter. Very disappointed.
1,Did not work for me,"Bought this to remove wallpaper. Put out steam, but but was not useful for the task. Ended up returning it. Not sure what this product is meant for"
1,first amazon item i have ever returned,"this thing is ridiculous. the steam it puts out is barely hot. it puts out a TON of water. It's useless for cleaning upholstery unless you want to soak your couch. I can't believe how many positive reviews it has. It's as though none of these people have stopped to consider whether spraying some cleaning solution and wiping with a cloth might be faster and easier than pointing a tepid steam wand at something for thirty seconds. this thing is a total waste of time and energy: there's no way that getting it out, filling it up, preheating it, and waiting for it to mist some dirt away is anything close to an efficient way to clean."
1,disappointed,Cant give review. it broke the second time I used it in a week. Have to return to mfg. am disappointed.
5,Worked great!,"I bought it solely to clean the burned on grease and pit on my stainless steel commercial stove and stainless backsplash. Since the stove is stainless steel, using a steel pad scratched the stainless and wasn't able to get it all. Using the Wagner 905 with the brass brush tip worked great. I let the steam and brush do all the work. The burned on grease and pit are completely gone. I am total satisfied with this steamer. Just wish they would have included 2 brass brushes."
2,I'm not certain if it works that well?,"Out of the box I marveled at the construction of this product. All the plastic pieces were made of heavy plastic and the product did not seem cheap at all.My only problems:1- the instructions stated that a full tank of water would provide 45 min of steam. i only received 20 min of steam.2- if you hold down the trigger for more than a minute the steam will eventually stop and you have to wait 1-2 minutes for the steam to start up again.3- one of the reviews for this product said that it cleaned grout between tiles very well. i used the steamer on my kitchen counter grout and bathroom tile grout and i was not able to remove any stains (or restore the original color of the grout).I do not plan to return this item b/c I figure that I'll eventually need to use steam for something (i.e. clean my wife's jewelry, remove stains from cloth instead of using the washer,....)"
2,Shoots mist but not steam,"My unit does not make real steam so I am returning it. I purchased a refurb unit so maybe this unit is just defective and the purchaser before me had the same issue although another reviewer estimated his unit was only making 110 degree mist like mine does. I can put my hand 2 inches in front of the nozzle and leave it there the entire time the unit is running. I estimate the ""steam"" is in the 110 degree F range. It does make a nice well distributed mist. I want hot steam so I am buying a different brand unit."
4,Wagner steamer,"Good little steamer. I wish that the brush would rotate instead of me scrubbing, but it does the job. I have cleaned my kitchen sink, shower tiles and stove and I like the job that it did. I think that it would be too powerful for my hardwood floors and would not recommend it for that job. I have not read all the reviews so I don't know if anyone else mentioned it, but I believe it is recommended that you use distilled water for this machine.I like the very long hose since you can reach everything, and it has many extra attachments that have come in handy. I will try it on my windows and the rims of my tires next. The real plus here for me is that you are not using chemicals. I know that it would be easier to just used the chemicals to clean (and of course you don't have that just cleaned smell with the steamer), but I think that trade-off is worth it for me."
5,Little Steamer,"I was happy to receive my power seam cleaner. I did own one and it died on me so I couldn't wait to replace it. I read the reviews on many power cleaners and decided to take a chance on this one. Well I must say I have not been disappointed with this cleaner, it's perfect for my needs."
5,Fabulous for Tile Floors!,I bought this unit because I have close to 2000 sf of ceramic tile and a recalcitrant little dog. Best feature for me is the ability to clip a microfiber cloth on the scrubby head I use to steam clean the floors. I also like the small jet-head type attachment for cleaning the shower door tracks and icky corners.
2,Good for only wallpaper!,"If you are planning to use this steamer other than wallpaper like those pictures show, this is not for you. Steam is so weak and not hot enough that I can almost put it on my finger...Only good thing is Amazon's easy returning process and that's why I gave 2 stars, instead of 1!"
4,Would buy again.,While I think the steam could be hotter (I had my hand not far from it while using it and it didn't hurt) it does work great. It was the only thing that took the mold up from our bathroom floor and if just for that it was completely worth every penny! I have used it to clean my oven door and my wood floors and it did great on both. I am currently using it to remove wallpaper and it is making the job SO much easier.
4,Power Steamer,"I provide the cleaning of mobile homes in a mobile home park when residents move out, the Wagner steamer has provided an easy solution to cleaning the stoves without alot of muscle. The Wagner steamer has already paid for itself in just a weeks time. Thank You Wagner.."
2,Not what I expected,"The steam is quite loud coming out of the attachment, but it's tolerable... My problem lies in that the machine doesn't produce very much force behind the steam; Cleaning grout in between my shower tiles, I had to take the brush attachment off the nozzle attachment and hold the steam nozzle directly on the tiles to get results. For a supposedly commercial quality machine, this is unacceptable."
2,disappointed,"when i push the button to spray the steam, lots of water drips out of it all over the floor. I tried to steam clean a couch and it just smeared the dirt. will be good for other things than carpeting or upholstry"
1,"Sadly, I'm returning my steamer, too.","Even using distilled water (because our water tends to have a lot of minerals) the steamer just ran out of...steam. No pressure. Certainly hot enough but if it won't come out in anything other than a ""puff"" doesn't help much. It'll be going back. :("
4,wagner steamer review,"We have only used the wallpaper steemer part so far. The wallpaper had been on the walls since 1975 and it was not a project we were looking forward to. The steamer really helped, once you got the hangof using it. Would definitely recommend. For a project like this it is worth spending the money. I also bought this product as I didnt want to spent $100 on something I would only use once. I am looking forward to using the other attachments for my cleaning projects."
1,Interesting gadet . . . .would have been better if it had actually worked,"I needed this to remove wallpaper from two bathrooms in order to be able to paint them. This looked like the solution but it did little other than make a steamy mess on the walls and floor. The wall paper did not come off any easier than if I had used the scoring tool and some water with a sponge which is what I ended up using. In the kitchen, I used a recommendation from the local paint person at Lowes which was to paint right over it as long as there were not areas coming off and it looked great. If you wan this to remove wallpaper, you will likely be disappointed."
5,steamer,"This is a wonderful product, my husband does canning, and he loves it, it cut his time in more than half, of getting old cann out of chair."
5,well made,"Length:: 3:33 MinsI was trying to decide between this steam cleaner and another model, but the wallpaper remover attachment sold me on this one. The person who owned our house before had some sort of wall paper border fetish, there are borders in every room, running around the top by the popcorn ceiling and even in the kitchen between the counter tops and cabinet. It's been horrible to try and remove but the Wagner just steams it right off, without removing the paint underneath. I don't care about the paint as we are going to repaint, but it does show it's probably not hurting our drywall.The tank isn't hard to carry around though it is sturdy. I haven't really tried cleaning with it yet, the test will be my sons bathroom. If it works in there it was worth every penny and then some, but for wall paper removal it's great."
4,Wagner Steamer,"Th Wagner 905 Power Steamer and Cleaner works ok, but for the water that you put in to the machine it does not last as long as the instructions state."
4,Clean Machine,"Great little cleaner, gets the job done! It is nice to know that I can sterilize any room in my house and not need cleaning products that are harmful to the environment. Needs to have a cord wrap and could use a bit more pressure. Other than that great little machine for all your cleaning needs."
4,love it,"When you take the Wagner out of the box, the first thing you notice is the structure quality. There's not a lot pieces to put together and everything is well made and not out of flimsy plastic pieces. Can it steam! I went on a steaming frenzy. I steamed the kitchen, bathrooms, floors - no compliant here. It steamed in 30 minute intervals and it definitely get hot so you need to be really careful around wood carpet and paint. Definitely recommend this product."
1,"Operated half-heartedly on 1st try, didn't work at all on 2nd","The first time I used the steamer, its performance was spotty. The steam didn't always dispense when the trigger was pressed, and the steam mostly wasn't hot enough to really clean anything -- at the time I was trying to clean a shower with slightly mildewed/molded grout and caulk. Had extremely limited success. The second time I tried to use it, today, the steamer failed to work. Period. It steamed the water and the indicator light showed that the water had reached the right temperature to start steaming, but once the trigger was depressed, absolutely nothing happened. Started the whole process over, hoping it'd work, and nothing. So, so not worth the money - doesn't deliver as promised AT ALL."
5,great buy!,"I used this for cleaning grout. I just recently bought a house, and the grout was completely black. I knew it would be hard to clean it, so I read a ton of reviews and found this to be the best product.It was still hard to get the grout clean (and I have a ton of tile), but I found that using powder bleach, scrubbing it in, and then using the steam cleaner, all the dirt came right off. On the areas that weren't so dark, I just used the steamer and it was really easy. I was amazed at how much dirt the steamer got out.No complaints here!"
4,Great for painting fences and shudders,"I literly save days when it comes to painting my fence and shudders also.The real payback from the cost of the unit and the time spent having to clean it each time comes from doing medium to large jobs. I bought this to steam from my local hardqware store , but found it worked good for steaming away an ice dam. The cord & hose is really long and we were able to hang it out the window to steam mold off the 1st story roof. Nicwe product! I have cleaned grout, grease, tar, vynal siding, fences, shutters, and countertops. it steams my lawn mower ok too."
4,Awesome machine,"The tile floor in my bathroom was terribly discolored. The cleaning service I had didn't actually clean it, they just swished water over it. I ordered this machine and when I received it I immediately went to work on the tiles. I am AMAZED at how clean I got them! The grout is now white, and the tiles themselves are a much lighter color after getting years of dirt and grime cleaned off them. I would highly recommend this machine to anyone with stubborn stains."
3,Wagner Steam 905 Steam Cleaner,"I purchased this machine after seeing the favorable comments posted here. My only dissappointment is that the heat lamp turns on about every 5 seconds so that I have to stop and wait for the steam to heat up and the indicator light goes out before resuming cleaning. I find this to be very time consuming. Can anyone else comment on this and why it happens so frequently. Also, the attachments are very flimsy so you can't put too much pressure on them."
3,It's ok.,"I was so excited when I ordered this product, because the reviews made it sound like a wonder-machine. It does clean my tile floor, but it is a lot of work. I have to keep going over the area and it leaves waster on the floor. (It also occaisionally trips my breaker.) It has gotten some of my grout clean, but I still have not achieved the original color. It is quiet, and warms up pretty quickly, but I don't think the steam time is as long as the directions claim it is. It does do an awesome job on the shower and bathtub. I am not sorry I bought the machine, but it is not the wonder-machine that some of the reviews claim it is."
4,Cleans surfaces in half the time!,"I love my Wagner steamer. My only issue is that the attachments have to be stored independently of the steamer and the power cord doesn't retract for easy storage. My son spilled juice in our refrigerator, which sat overnight because he never told anyone, the steamer helped me clean it up in minutes! It even cleans the stove top! I haven't had the opportunity to use it to remove wallpaper, yet. With all of the attachments and ease of use, this little machine actually makes me enjoy cleaning."
5,Heavy Duty Cleaning,"This cleans our white tile floors pretty well. It takes out even dried grime and food. We cleaned our oven and stainless steel stove top with it, it did an amazing job. Once heated and filled to capacity, the steam lasts for more than half an hour of cleaning. It is very light weight and easy to manouevre. It does a good job cleaning bathrooms. However it doesnt clean mildew very well. It doesnt leak as much as we expected it to reading other reviews but you do need a supply of wash cloths or microfiber towels. You don't need to buy special cloths with it. Any regular wash cloth or microfiber cloth can be used with it. It does take a good 10 minutes for the floor to dry. But the floors get really clean."
4,well pleased,I got this wagner to clean my walls. it did a great job as long as i used the cloth that came with it. left some marks if i dident use the cloth. it gets verry hot. i was impressed.
5,Works great!,"Purchased from AMAZON.com, it works great on upholstery, first I used it on our microfiber couch.. it lifted stains right up without hassle, then I had used it on our laminate wood flooring and tile... The tile is about 30 years old and it looks like brand new since using this machine. We previously had a Swiffer wet jet and I did not like how wasteful it was with having to replace 3-5 pads after cleaning a couple of rooms and the use of chemicals so when we decided we wanted a steamer this one was our first pick because we can use it on virtually everything... floors, home and auto upholstery, windows\mirrors, bathrooms and kitchen. I based my purchase on the reviews here on amazon. I really don't know why people would give this a one star... it is excellent for household use."
3,Great steamer -- but attachments are poorly designed.,"This steamer is great at removing wallpaper, sanitizing tile floors with the floor head and getting the grime out of our hot water heat baseboards (until the nozzle broke--read on). Not so great at other clean-ups like ovens, grills and bathroom tile where you still need elbow-grease and a green scrub pad to do the best job. The 3 stars is for mediocre customer support from Wagner. Within 2 months of purchase, the jet nozzle cracked nearly in half making the steamer useless with this attachment. Wagner will sell replacements for $2.75 ea +s/h. M2C -- they should have offered freebies. If all you want is a wallpaper steamer, there are cheaper alternatives. This unit is hardly durable enough for regular household cleaning chores."
5,My New Wagner Steamer,This steamer is made so well. It does everything it says it does and more. My entire home is much cleaner now.
3,Cleans Sanitizes but attachments don't seem that sturdy,"This was a gift to clean my heavily soiled floors in my new home. The floors definitely looked better after the use, but with no thanks to the attachments. I steamed and hand scrubbed my floors. The floors were so badly soiled I don't think this machine had the power to completely clean them. I like the machine and would recommend it but the attachments are not strong enough to seriously scrub anything."
5,Wish I would have bought this a long time ago...,"I bought a house totally covered in wallpaper and have been taking it down room by room. The first four rooms, I used several methods - wet newspapers, fabric softeners, wall paper scrapers, etc. They all didn't seem to save me much time or effort. I decided to buy the steamer to help me with taking the wallpaper down in the living room. I can't believe how well it worked! It literally melted the paper right off the wall. It also made the whole process cleaner. Using the other methods, I was getting water and torn scraps of paper all over the floor and myself. This product is worth every penny."
4,Cleaning without chemicals,"I wanted to buy a steam cleaner for my tile floors, when I saw this product, priced similarly to just a floor steam cleaner, I went ahead and bought it. I appreciate that it has attachments for the rug, windows (which I use on marble tile in my bathroom) and floor. The other attachments (nozzle like) work well, but are very loud! I have used the steamer on sections of carpet that are ""high traffic"" and have been please with the results. I also have been pleased with how the attachments seem to melt away calcium build-up in the bathroom!"
2,Not Worth It,"Tried it on shower grout that wasn't extremely dirty ... in one place it actually stained the grout. In the remainder it had no effect.Tried it on the porcelain coated grates on our Dacor range ... no effect.In my opinion, conventional cleaning techniques ... elbow grease and detergents ... work much better.I'm glad I purchased it at Costco ... it goes back today."
2,Not a miracle worker!,"Anyone who buys this has to understand that dirt does not just magically disappear with this item. And if your dirt is truly been there for awhile, you will have to at least pre-soak and when you do use the steam, you will have to carry a towel with you to mop up the dirty water.Considering its reviews, I am most decidedly disappointed. This machine ins NOT, IS NOT for terrazzo or Mexican tile. You will not be happy if you plan to use this on anything but an easy wash tile and in that case you probably don't need it. It is good for dust and for dusty areas that are hard to reach. Ditto picture frames.You will either have to get something better if you have true dirt. Also, the plastic parts break easily."
1,Not worth it,"I purchased this steamer at Costco for $69 and feel I was ripped off. I tried clean bathroom tile, a bathtub and a basement floor. Steam was generated, by no real cleaning took place. Liquid Dawn and some hard scrubbing was much more effective. I think this appliance was designed by lawyers more concerned about product liability than real cleaning. Purchase at your own risk."
4,No more scrubbing shower walls,"I bought this unit for my hardwood floors, which it did a great job on, and decided to try it on my shower walls. I LOVE IT!! Not only does it make my shower walls clean without all the scrubbing, it cleaned the shower doors and tracks they slide on too. I now use it to clean the hub caps on my car and they have never shined like this before. This is a great steamer and a good price."
4,steam cleaner,I researched steamers for quite some time and I found most were cheap with bad reviews or they were several thousand dollars with great reviews. I stumbled on the Wagner during my research and looked over all of the details and decided to order one. I loved all the attachments and capabilities of the Wagner. I am absolutely impressed with this steamer. I have a lot of tiles in my house and it works wonderfully. It works great for sanitizing sinks and showers. Great purchase!
5,great steamer,"This steamer works great and it makes steam for a long time. I find it easy to use. You can really get into the crevices and cracks. Just watch the grime melt away. It takes only a couple minutes to come up to temperature. It is loud, like compressed air. Stuff that I would have to scrub with cleaners just melts away with this thing."
5,Great Little Steamer,"I had bought other steamers and searched the internet and finally found this Wagner Steamer and am so very pleased. I have not had it for very long and have used it to do tile floors, tile grout and am looking forward to using it for wallpaper removal, cleaning my self-cleaning oven floor and my glass shower door.I have never had to use the three cups of water, in fact I put in one cup which is supposed to last 15 minutes and I will tell you I have a big kitchen and have done the floor and had half of that water left.It is a bit unhandy to have to lift the unit up to the sink to empty it, but the other good things far outweigh this one negative.I have never used a machine that gave this much steam. I let my machine cool overnight one evening and before I opened the water cap to empty in the morning, I pushed the lever for steam, and there was still a little puff of pressure left in there. Awesome."
5,WOW! This is a wonderful steamer,I had bought this to clean my floor grout used with the attachment brush this did a great job for home use. This did a wonderful job just for cleaning my kitchen and bathroom floor with the mop attachment steaming the dirt made it feel real clean and sanitized. I had also used it to clean my grill a lot of grease loosened but still had to wipe off grease.Great item for the money.
4,This machine is a $$$ $aver..Is there anyting it can't clean?,"Bought this steamer for cleaning around the house (mainly carpet/tile floor, bathroom, & anything in between). My dog should sleep better knowing I will not put him out, since the steamer cleans his puke stains on the carpet. Even stains that are years old it did a pretty good job on. But be careful with colored items on the carpet; since the steamer will break them down, the color will adhere to the carpet, and you must then get the color out (takes more time); so make sure you vaccum first before you use this steamer."
4,Wagner Power Steamer and Cleaner - purchased through Amazon,"The steamer is a very good value for the price. I like the easy use of the unit and for its smaller size - it has plenty of power. As others have mentioned, the small brush attachments do wear quickly - BUT I suspect that is because the tasks I put them to were very demanding. Thank you for helping me make my whole kitchen and the appliances sparkle."
4,Review on steamer...,"I was told by a friend that this steamer is amazing and had to get one. I am happy with it...it does the job, but I don't know if I would say...amazing.! I had some product build up on the bathroom floor and did fine!!"
4,Great power steamer,I love my Wagner power steamer. I have used it for cleaning my bathrooms and it was wonderful. I still used some cleaning sprays but hardly used any and just for touch up. It has plenty of power and the steam lasts quite awhile. If you have to add more water it heats up in just a few minutes. The long handle makes it very accessible in small areas. Next to try is my stove. I think it will make cleaning the grease much easier and without sprays! It also has a wallpaper attachment that I am planing on using.
4,Good steamer for a clean freak,"Purchased to clean bathroom and kitchen grime in a new apartment. I'm a total clean/germ freak and maintain a very high standard of clean in my home.Easy to put together. If you live in a hard water area like I do, suggest using filtered or distilled water only. Heated up a full tank in about 10 minutes and provided good steam for 45 - 55 minutes (depending on on how much steam you require).Did a great job on grimy grout and tile, greasy kitchen floors, walls, cabinets and appliances. Note: NO steam machine will get 100% of the dirt out. You still have to use elbow grease and cleaners/degreasers if you want a complete clean. That's just the facts of life.Using the Wagner steamer sure made the job alot easier - it blasted off crusty nasty stuff so I didn't have to scrub so hard. I used the steamer first, then cleaner/scrub for tough spots, then steamed again to remove cleaner residue. I am very happy with this unit."
4,Very good steamer,"I bought this steamer in the middle of a suspected infestation of bedbugs (later I discovered it was a false alarm), so I needed a machine that was powerful enough to steam every corner of my 1-bedroom, without spending a fortune.The Wagner 905 does the job perfectly. The only (minor) inconvenient is that, every time you start steaming, some water comes out, so you'd better start from a hard surface or have a plastic bag handy.Besides that, it's perfect. Enough power, enough steam, quick to refill and warm up."
5,PERFORMANCE OF STEAM CLEANER,"I HAVE HAD STEAM CLEANERS BEFORE, NONE COMPARE TO THIS PRODUCT.THE AMOUNT OF STEAM WAS AMAZING. I DECIDED TO TEST IT ON THE WORST TILE GROUT IN THE HOUSE,IN THE ENTRY WAY, 20 YRS OLD. wow! IT BLASTED THE DIRT NOT JUST OFF BUT OUT. I HAD A CONSISTANT STREAM OF STEAM, NO SPUTTERING ETC. INE TIME I THOUGHT THE STEAM BUTTON WAS STUCK, HOWEVER I DISCOVERED THAT THE LOCK WAS LOCKED, I MUST HAVE PUSHED IT WHEN HOLDING THE WAND , SO MAYBE IT IS JUST TO EASY TO TURN THE LOCK ON AND NOT REALIZE IT. I THEN DID THE BASE BOARDS, SAME RESULT, i HAVE A WHOLE HOUSE THAT WILL NOW COME UNDER ATTACK. MY HUSBAND WAS AMAZED ALSO, AND HAS PLANS TO USE IT. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ITEM."
5,More bang for your buck!,"I feel more than qualified to write this review because this is in fact my fifth steam cleaner!!! The older one gets, the more one has a genuine appreciation for steam cleaning. It saves time, money and it easy on the joints! There is no better way to GO GREEN! In my humble opinion steam cleaning is superior to all other methods of cleaning...the results consistently validate this statement. Yes, seeing is believing!I have spent significantly more money on my other steam cleaners. By far, the Wagner Spray Tech 282004 1,500-Watt On-Demand Power Steamer out performs my previous purchases!!! Talk about more bang for the buck!My daughter bought this machine because of my experience with it and is as pleased with its performance as I am!Mrs. Clean recommends purchasing this machine.Note: Get in the habit of switching off the unit when not in use. Respect this machine and it will serve you well!"
2,a bit shoddy,"I worked pretty well for a small machine, but the accessories (brushes, window cleaner etc) started to come apart. I decided to send it back and but the McCulloch MC-1275 Heavy-Duty Steam Cleaner which was a little bit more expensive- When I opened the MuCulloch, guess what???It is EXACTLY the same machine as the Wagner, just a different label on it!! They are probably made by the same company in China and the just brand them differently. Too soon to tell if the accessories are as crappy, but I wam not confident!!"
3,Good Steamer For Clean Up Jobs Around The House,"This is a decent steamer for cleaning floors and household appliances. I mainly use it for cleaning dingy grout on tile floors, ovens and kitchen appliances.PROS:Creates a lot of steam to power through tough jobsHeats up fairly quickly 5 minutesLong hose lengthCheap Price (Now Costco sells them)Still better than the Shark Mop or Monster steamers by farCONS:Brush attachments wear out quickly both the metal and plastic brush.There is NO handle on this thing. Once you use it often you want to move from room to room and a handle on this thing would make it 10x more usable. I've even considered crazy gluing the gray plastic nozzle gun holder into the unit so I could use it as a handle and pick the darn thing up.Sometimes instead of steam this thing shoots out fiery hot water from the nozzle. I don't know why it does this maybe it's water condensing in the hose or poor design.Wish it came with more attachments since they wear out so quickly."
5,WOW!,I must say that this is probably the best item i have bought in a long time. I recieved it when scheduled and of course i had to try it out. I must say that the cleaning power is amazing. so far i have used it in the bathroom. Taking stains out of the grout in my tub was almost instant. in the kitchen i have used it to clean the stove. Which i must add that i was very impressed. stains that Easy Off couldn't remove came out within seconds. The only thing i was not too happy about was that the machine came with only 1 cloth for the floors. which sort of stinks when you have alot of floor to cover. All in All i LOVE this machine and highly recommend it to anyone.
3,"Only for small tasks, not heavy duty","Cleans fridge and oven well, but not good for bathroom or any other heavy duty task. Tried cleaning the kitchen floor but did not do such a great job."
5,suited my needs,"I did a lot of research before I ordered this item. For the ""class"" of steam cleaners, this one works as it says it will. I did find myself wondering around the house looking for something new to clean. Even though it's not a handheld unit, it's easy to use and put away. The only negative thing I can say about it is that I wish the steam evaporated after using it...you do have to wipe up the water. The reason I bought it was to clean some windows that had mold and dirt on them in a house that was not lived in for a year that I was remodeling. It did a great job."
5,Removing vinyl floor tiles too,"Bought the steamer for removing plastic coated wallpaper and it does a fantastic job. But it helps to perforate the wallpaper first with another tool. When I was struggling on removing some vinyl floor tiles with a hammer and chisel, decided to try the Wagner steamer. After holding the large wallpaper attachment over a tile for 30 seconds, I was able to literally lift the whole tile up with a scraper cause it melted the tile adhesive.Wear gloves, the tiles are hot. I'll definitely recommend this steamer for many household cleaning tasks."
1,MO MOM,"This steamer throws out too much water! Attempted to use on windows and had to mop the excess water from everywhere! When there is that much water present, the steam doesn't work. I let the steamer heat longer than the indicator light, that didn't help. I suspended the hose after use to rid of any excess water in the hose, that didn't help. All it does is throw alot of water with a little steam. The steam on my iron could do a better job. I was REALLY disappointed when attempted to use in the bathroom, better off using a spray bottle. In the kitchen, it didn't even loosen small spills except where I let the water sit. I can't imagine trying to use to remove wallpaper (which is one of the main reasons I purchased). I have attempted to work with Wagner, but have reached a wall there. I'm not new to cannister steam cleaners. I have used 3 different ones, loved them, so decided to splurge and get my own. Thought the Wagner name would make it a good purchase, my mistake. Very disappointed!!"
4,GREAT CLEANER!!!,I just recently purchased this steam cleaner.... from seeing all the others out there on tv im glad that i purchased this one... Its a GREAT CLEANER! cleaned my shower and looks brand new when i first bought my house... cleaned the mold and mildew right off with a little help of tilex and elbow grease... other wise it is great and cant wait to try it on my tile around the house!
4,Gets the job done,Great steamer....Works really good. My only complaint it is hard to lug around. It needs a pull handle....But good steam that last a long time...
4,Pretty darn good,"I really like this product, with a few notations. The attachments for cleaning the floor could be improved. It scratched up my floor, but we are putting down a new one anyway so I wasn't totally upset. Also, it would be great it there were an attachment to steam out wrinkles from clothes. I tried it and couldn't find a good way that worked. Besides that the product does produce enough steam to clean my bathroom and kitchen in one go, which is great for me."
1,Not Effective Cleaner,"I am baffled as to how this product received so many 5 star reviews. I tried cleaning a stove top, bathroom tile, a stainless steel sink and a greasy cupboard door, and the steam cleaner didn't do any better than a quick wipe with a wet cloth. Either the steam isn't hot enough, or the spray isn't strong enough, or steam-cleaning in general just isn't that effective."
2,Wagner Steamer Cleaner,I am ready to send this product back. While the machine does create steam it does little to clean. There is not enough pressure of steam coming out to really benefit the use of this tool. I used it to tackle wall paper and found the product to be more in my way than and plus to help reduce the work load.
1,Not Hot at all,"Nice design, but the temperature is not nearly as hot as it should be, which defeats the purpose of buying it to kill bugs or germs."
2,Will not last beyond the 1 year Warranty,"I bought this steamer a year and a half ago returned it in the first year for repairs, and just threw it away (beyond the 1 year warranty). I was not a heavy user, I used it apx. once every 3 months. As for the quality of the work it has trouble breaking up grease off the stove, will work on minor cleaning needs. Buy at your own risk."
2,Not very impressed,There was nothing special about this machine. I can do the same amount of work as this machine does with a rag and soapy water. It isn't totally useless I suppose...but not worth spending the money. I was expecting something great.
3,a bit disappointed...,"My major disappointment is that the attachments were not included! Part of the reason I purchased this was so I could use it on the floor as well as the counters, etc. What I received works as advertised. It is a pain, though, to get water into the tank without a funnel."
1,Chocolate turned white - was inedible.,"Chocolate had turned white from improper storage, or maybe age. It was inedible. Seller requires you to jump through numerous hoops (rma, etc.) for a return, so I was screwede on this order."
1,Extremely disappointed,"Not only did they lose track of my packages (lost in Arizona for 5 days) after asking for expedited shipping. They did refund the shipping, but once the packages arrived (late for use in office party) they were inedible due to temperature changes. Their office could not be reached by phone but through email they agreed to refund but that did not help that we were without a promotional item on the day it was needed."
3,Bit trite,"I literally bought almost every book on divorce on the shelf at my local store. This one turned out to be very simplistic, though I suppose if you are having a very hard time with simple matters or are dealing with an unreasonable spouse, the examples could be good. My largest complaint was that to illustrate his points, he used fake examples, which were often over-exaggerated. I could have used a more in-depth, realistic discussion. I would have given fewer stars, but the last chapter was the best, and it didn't even deal with divorce issues per se! It was about raising children in general and specifically gave good advice about not engaging in power struggles with your children, to just be firm and consistent. Personally, I would rather have found helpful information throughout the book than just at the end, but I do have an amicable situation with my ex, so I am very fortunate; perhaps someone with a more difficult situation would be better served."
3,uncomfortable band,"This is a nice watch, but I wish it had a more comfortable band. The links are fairly long, in my case forcing choice between too tight and too loose. I chose loose, and it still marks my wrist."
2,LIAR!!,"This man wrote a book of lies about MY life. I would appreciate it if you would stop selling it. I can prove what I am saying. He is in Israel and I could not offerd to fight him via the Hague convention because it would have cost over $20,000.00. With three kids in college that was the priority - so he just sits in Israel and Lies! THE CHILDREN WANT NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM!"
2,Operations & Logistics theses papers,"Bought this book for my MBA program. Book has quality content on subject matter. But who cares about quality of content if book is not reader friendly? Book is written in a very impersonal way and in passive tenses, not reader friendly. The book feels like a compilation of various thesis and academic papers meant for publication in a professional journal. Though having a colorful hardback, inside editing is very much formatted like school term / academic papers - everything is in black. I get the impresssion that no real native english speaking person reviewed this book or is remotely associated with writing this book--the french co-author may have edited the book.I did not find reading this book pleasurable - has a very academic feel. I struggled with reading it, rephrasing many of the sentences to active form to ease understanding. Overall, the book needs serious gramatical review."
2,Not a bad global operations textbook,"I used this book for a global operations class. It contains both text and cases in one book. However, cases in some chapters do not directly relate to the content presenting in those chapters. Moreover, some cases are really difficult to read and understand the context of the case for analysis. However, there are some good HBS cases."
4,Good-spirited,"These are energetic and straight-forward renditions of medieval tunes from England, Italy, France and beyond. The arrangements are simple and are played on authentically constructed instruments, for a sound that is sweet and without pretension. The voices are perhaps not as nuanced as one might wish, but they work well with the spare instrumentation, for an over-all effect of effortless and accomplished musicianship. Some mediveal performers push the ""cheery lilt"" too far, becoming almost frenetic. The pace seems right here--good-spirited and enjoyable."
4,Just great,"My sister is actually stuck on this game, and that's the only reason she gave it four stars instead of five.I had bought this, as a part of the whole Christmas thing. I got a bunch of games, actually. We had Ty 1-3 at one point, but ended up selling them due to moving and lack of funds and such. I bought them all, again, here, and haven't regretted it. The games are super fun, and family-friendly. Our mother really enjoys them, even, and so do our younger cousins.The characters, the story lines, the missions, all-around great game."
1,I wish I could review this product,"This was the second copy of Ty 3 that I have purchased. The first one I purchased was a Christmas present. When my grandson tried the game, it would not load. I tried the game on my system and the same thing. I returned that game and bought my second one here at Amazon. This second game was exactly the same so it was returned also. My grandsons have the first and second version of this game and were looking forward to Ty 3. I will not be buying it for a third time!"
5,Great CD!,"I have known Justin since his childhood in Upstate New York, and I must say that this CD is AMAZING. The Berkley School of Music has defintely refined his gift and created an inspirational album that so many can appreciate. You will not be disappointed! :-)"
5,GREAT NEW ARTIST!!!!,"This CD features nine original songs by Justin Brooks, a Berklee student in Boston. Justin writes wonderful lyrics and has artful composition to his music. This CD has soulful ballads as well as rock music. The songs vary from love songs about ""Julia"", songs of consoation to ""Caroline"" as she is ""swimming in the shadows"", love lost in ""New York City"", earning angels' confidence in ""Take to the Wind"", and the life of a Comanche Warchief in ""Quanah"". Each song on this CD is a solid work of art. The listener will not be disappointed!!!"
1,Tax write off?,"I loved this TV when I got it. Thirteen days after the warranty expired, the lamp burned out. I called customer service in Huntsville, AL and they agreed to extend the warranty to cover the lamp replacement. I was impressed enough to overlook the fact that the 'authorized service center' took two weeks to replace the lamp and did not turn off the ""replace lamp"" message when the TV is turned on. A few months after the extended warranty expired, I got the infamous ""blue streak"". So far it is not that objectionable most of the time but I understand it just gets worse. I have two options; sell it to someone for a few hundred bucks or give it to Goodwill.What is a reasonable value to claim for the charitable contribution since some of you have gone that route? This 3yr old TV is complete junk from my point of view, but short of selling it, I do not know how to value this."
1,WARNING: DO NOT BUY ZENITH !!!,"Prior to buying the TV we had a 27"" CRT TV that lasted 19 years. So we decided to buy a new TV since it was getting old. So in 1/17/2004 we bought a 40"" Projection TV (R40W46) with a 2 years extended warranty. The TV has been performing great and we have been very happy with it until just last week when we noticed ""blue shadows"" all over the screen.After looking over the manual and adjusting the convergence, no success.To fix this TV outside of its warranty will cost over $1,000 dollars, and with prices on TV's dropping it makes no sense to send it in for repair. It has basically become a disposable TV. We are very disappointed that our TV has only lasted 3 years. I'm sending it to Goodwill.I'm very disappointed that Zenith will not stand behind their products. My only mistake was not researching Zenith TVs prior to buying since I had full faith in the brand.I found other people on the internet with the same exact problem !!I'm sorry to say this was my last Zenith TV."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE THIS TV **updated post**,"I have had this Zenith model for over a year now and have been happy with it up until now. Several weeks ago, the picture developed a blue streak about the size of my forearm. I contacted an authorized Zenith service center and found out the problem is not uncommon. The part to repair has to be replaced in its entirety and costs over $1600. I verified this was the same story at two different service centers. I contacted Zenith to raise a stink and THEY WILL NOT stand behind the product once the warranty expires. So consider this a warning !!!!"
5,zenith,"i looked for a widesrcreen that would fit my space requirements, and found it with my 52"" zenith. at about 10"" less deep than cathode type projection tv's, it fit my limited space. the picture is fabulous and i couldn't be any happier. it was delivered in perfect condition and on time."
1,It was great while it lasted,"This was my first big screen TV. I was very pleased with it, while it lasted. 15 months after I bought, it died. The repair shop said it will cost at least $1200 to fix it and even after that, it may not work."
3,Informational but slow,"It could have been because my husband and I were tired that night but it felt as if the movie moved quite slow. Very informative though in how Hitler (German leader), Stalin (Russian Leader), Churchill (England's leader) and Roosevelt (USA's leader)all thought of each other and mis-judged each other at times. It seemed to be a mind chess game between all the leaders. This movie focused in on WWII."
1,"Oh, So Bad.","If you're looking for world's worst music video, this is it. My husband and I made it through about twenty minutes of blue plasma-like light, an attempt at an artsy-blurry picture of someone practicing Yoga, scenery from some unidentified place, some Chinese words, and then the whole boring thing started again with a different Yoga posture (not to be practiced by the viewer -- just for atmosphere), different scenery, more blue plasma, and more Chinese words. My husband finally fast-forwarded through about an hour's worth of this stuff before we kicked the DVD out and returned it.If you're buying this for the music, you'll be sorely (as in ""ouch"") disappointed. It isn't even New Age. It's just bad. Annoyingly bad.There is nothing balancing about Balance. It isn't pretty. It isn't appealing. It doesn't even give you anything to sit back and stare at because the visuals do not blend together and the music is so irritating.Don't bother. Take a walk or sit in the yard instead."
5,Queen-Up Close and Personal,"This was a very interesting portrait of a drag legend. It was sad at times but very informative. Highly reommend for those curious about the TV, TS,CD, Drag dynamic"
5,excellent vendor...,The item is exactly as advertized...shipment was super super fast...recommend this vendor to all...A+++++++ Will buy again and check them out whenever I am here.
4,Hanging File Frame,"Item does the job. Holds in place well. Could be a little more sturdy as far as the material it's made out of, but not really a big deal as the main purpose is to hold the hanging folders & this it does. It was easy to put together & does not drop or sway. Excellent for the price."
5,letter folder medal racks,These medal racks were very easy to put together and they work perfectly. They were exactly what we needed and they fit the cabinet drawers just fine. The seller described them exactly in their promotional piece.
2,Disappointed,"Loving racing sims as I do, I was very much looking forward to this one. I have not been able to make the game work with my wheel which does work with Nascar and World of Outlaws. Now it just takes up space on my pc."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!,"I'm sure that Edward Whymper was a fine man and author and The Ascent of the Matterhorn is a good book, but this particular edition of it is not readable. It is extremely heavily laden with typoes, rendering it difficult to read."
2,Be careful 1 doll not 2,"Picture misleading. The package contains in reality only 1 dollPoor quality, as you can expect from this kind of merchandise"
4,Hi Volume Check Valve,"The check valve flow is great! You need to publish the OD tube sizes of this valve, though. They were smaller than I was planning for. The input and output tubes are just a little too small for the .170"" ID X 1/4"" OD tubing specified for my project."
2,MAC USERS BEWARE!,"WARNING: This is NOT a postcript printer -- which means if you use any graphics based program (Quark, InDesign, Illustrator, etc) you wil have to buy separate, VERY EXPENSIVE postscript software. After an eternal quest to find a good quality printer that is postscript compatible, I finally purchased the HP B9180. The print quality and colors are amazing, but this printer sucks up ink like a sponge. HP... please make another printer with built-in postcript for us designers!!!"
1,In 25 years this is the worst printer I've ever used,If you like spending 3 hours ever couple of days clearing phantom errors this is the printer for you. I would have rate it zero stars but Amazon requires at least one star to post a review.
2,"Great, but unfixable problems after one year.","I do like this printer - really great inks. Did a lot of research on printers before getting this one about 2 years ago. However, after having problems with ink splotches on the sides of my prints, and after realizing that it started guzzling enormous amounts of ink during its routine cycling, I did a little more research. I read online at Duncan Davidson's site that he's been having the same problems. http://duncandavidson.com/2008/08/two-big-hp-b9180-problems.html, which leads me to believe my problem wasn't a one-off. After a few weeks of replacing inks, and without printing, I'm finding that the printer has been using up all the ink doing its maintenance cycles. HP recommends leaving this printer on all the time, and turning it off doesn't solve the blotches on the edges of prints due to the printheads hitting the edges of paper. I'm hoping they fix this problem because initially i loved the printer."
2,MBT,"My first B9180 lasted about two weeks before sending a message saying ""Service Stall"". It never recovered and was replaced under warranty. My second B9180 lasted almost a month before sending the same message. It too was replaced under warranty. My 3rd B9180 lasted one year and 5 days. It then began spitting yellow ink all over photos and the inside of the printer. It was out of warranty and will cost me about $300 for an exchange through HP.When the printer actually works, it does a great job on prints ranging in size from 4 x 6 to 13 x 19. But I've got to think that my run of bad luck with these printers is more than just coincidence. I'd look elsewhere for a photo printer."
1,Just Stopped Working after One Month of Light Use,"I've owned this printer for less than two months. Just last week, it stopped working. After a few minutes with tech support, I was told I have ""defective firmware"" and that I can exchange it for a new one. Here's what it does: When I print something, it stops in the middle of the first piece of paper, and tells me I'm out of paper. Nothing prints, I'm actually not out of paper, the thing is just totally screwed up. Another thing, when I first bought it and set it up, before I had a chance to print one thing on it, it ran out of black matte ink. It wouldn't let me set it up on the network cause it wouldn't let me past the ""out of black matte ink"" message on the screen. My local stores do not carry this kind of speciality ink, so I had to wait until my ink arrived in the mail and the network person had to come back to my house to finish setting up the network."
2,VISTA Compatibility Warning,"Please note that this printer will not work as advertised with VISTA. HP customer support has informed me that the printer does not support 13x19 printing with VISTA. I learned this after troubleshooting and wasting major amounts of ink and costly paper. In this large size, prints only contain part of the image. I purchased this printer because HPs website advertises this printer as ""certified for VISTA"" and capable of borderless prints at 13x19. It amazes me that HP continues to falsely advertise their product. Be warned of this issue and HPs decision to continue to falsely advertise."
1,"Great Printer, HORRIBLE SERVICE","I purchased this printer about 9 months ago and have used it for photo printing. The print quality is good IF AND ONLY IF you can get the right paper profiles. Make sure your favorite papers are supported by this HP product.After just 9 months, I had a problem with the paper sensor. It no longer prints and just drags paper until it eventually jams. I have been working with HP for over 1 month to get a replacement printer. I've submitted the requested paperwork 3 times, but to no avail. Each call results in at least 3 transfers to different departments, nobody able to get this resolved.I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER HP PRODUCT!!I have been in the computer software industry for over 20 years and have never experienced such poor customer service. Shame on HP."
2,HP Photosmart B-9180,"I am on my third replacement printer in less that a year. Each time the unit worked for a week and then wouldn't function at all due to a hardware failure. Customer service is friendly and quick to answer but not at all helpful. I replaced all the ink cartridges and the Magenta was ""out of ink"" after less that 15 letter size prints. I would not recommend this printer."
1,the worst,this printer is hands down the most expensive to buy and maintain.. worse than my wife. complains no ink; needs service..getting ready for new ink wants more ink..you get it. photos are good quality but you average 50 cents a photo and 10 dollars in aggravation.today all support and products seem to be junk. years ago you bought something used it for years and you may even pass it on to someone else..today products are garbage no mater what you pay..that's my 2 cents...HP Photosmart Pro B9180 Printer
1,"Awfull, HP should be ashamed.","I replaced a CP 1700 that had been stolen with this printer. Four letter words; there are not enough of them to describe this incredable piece of junk. DO NOT BUY IT!Recently, a replace cart message appeared. I spent $115 for 3 new carts. I installed them and then immeadiately got a message to replace two of the printheads. I did so at an additional cost of $135. On turning on the printer got the same replace printhead message. I contacted HP on line help and was told there was nothing they would do, not could do buit would do, because the printer was out of warrenty. So another $250 down the drain and this piece of junk still won't work. Hello Epson goodby HP!"
4,Large Format Photo Printer HPB9180,Prints large prints (13x19) and smaller using a wide variety of papers with variable thickness.
1,Never again...,"I'm now on the fourth of these printers, the first three being returned to and replaced by HP due to various failures. This fourth one has latest for a couple of years, and now it has died too despite only light, periodic use. Now I'm stuck with a couple hundred dollars of cartridges, etc., for this over-sized doorstop. I'll try to sell them off on Craigslist. I currently have seven HP printers, and swear never to buy another. The only bright spot is that, as quickly as HP printers die, I'll soon be rid of them. Epson here I come."
1,Dont buy you have been warned,"Makes great prints when its working, but guzzles expensive ink, and has a known defect with the paper sensor, which fails after a little over a year and renders the printer a boat anchor - if you don't believe me google ""hp b9180 paper jam error"", or ""b9180 problems"",,,,HP customer service is useless,,,,,Buy this at your own risk."
1,Do Not Buy,"I bought a HP B9180 just over 1 year ago (17 days over a year). Now I am told unless I pay for Tech Support, HP will not help me with a common error on there B9180, $600.00 plus printer. You can go on the internet a see for your self ""Service Stall Press OK to continue"" or to HP web site and read reviews. This error message stops the printer from working or doing anything. I have printed about 25 pictures and now this printer is a piece of junk."
1,One terrible printer,"The first one I had broke down one week out of the one year warranty. So, I did the online tech support routine to keep costs down and they said, install a new set of carts (to no avail same problem)... Then support said I needed a new printer and that I could buy one from their used replacement program.So, I ponied up almost 300 for a replacement and guess what, the replacement didn't work, either. So, no relief for me. They said the print heads must be bad and I may have to buy a new set. Weeeelll with almost $1000 in and about 50 prints from the machine. You can figure a cost to me of $20 per print and lots of lost hours. I lost confidence in their ability to satisfy this wrong.... no more money for HP.Do yourself a favor: Don't buy this printer."
1,What a lemon,"So where do I start? There is nothing about this printer that works. 1. Out of the box printer kept throwing errors. Software upgrade fixed some of it or I suspect just suppressed the errors 2. Printer won't shut down - I have to yank the cable from the back. 3. Mac driver keep reporting that ""All print heads are missing"" and the printer keeps printing happily. 4. Colors are streaky when running small details yet the test page comes out clean.I spent $100s on HPs paper and genuine ink and wonder if it wasn't cheaper to send my jobs to a print shop... At $700 for the printer and $240 for set of inks this was by far the worst color printer I had."
4,Great quality printer,"Puts out a quality print. Inks are supposed to last about 200 years! Inks are VERY expensive! Printer is very noisy and takes a pretty large desktop footprint. It periodically cleans its own heads when left idle which can be startling when it just all the sudden turns on and does its thing. Great for photographers wanting commercial quality without the cost but as a casual color printer, its total overkill."
2,Express Exchange Warranty Program,"The express one-day warranty program is a joke. HP will only honor the warranty if they have a refurbished one available to send you. If they don't, you wait until they do! Of course, your customers will surely understand that......."
1,Photosmart B9180 Major Problems,"My first inclination that there was a problem with my Photosmart B9180 printer came about when ink usage started climbing and I wasn't using the printer at all. Be advised that when you leave it on, as HP suggests it will periodically use ink to clean the printheads. I started a Google search for a solution to the high ink useage and found James Duncan Davidson's blog, ([...]). It began the horror story for this printer. Between HP's lack of support for this and other problems, (service stalls, paper jams, Vista compatability, and noise)one can only conclude that you need to walk away from this printer."
1,subliminal depressant,"unbelievable. i was so impressed with this album at first. i even started to write an adoring review. i thought it was the best stuff i've heard in years. but then i found that upon repeated listenings the album has a remarkable effect. i noticed that my stomach became knotted. i lost my appetite. i had no patience for anything. i even stopped taking phone calls. i stopped bathing. it may seem hard to believe, but something about this album is terribly dangerous. i definitely don't understand it. but i strongly recommend that anyone predisposed to depression stay away. do not purchase this album. its interesting to be sure. maybe someone someday will discover that it works subliminally as a depressant. i don't know."
5,An Animated Alphabet,"An Animated Alphabet (Pocket Paragon Series,)Is a beautiful book for all people, enjoy your life."
1,Don't waste your time,"The other two reviewers were obviously friends of the people who put this 'film' out. Bad production quality, the same 10 second song loop plays repeatedly at the beginning.. No clear direction. Don't waste your time."
5,Revenge Factor,"I have been hearing about this film & saw the trailer onYOUTUBE.. Oh yeah , The best underground film yet. I haveemailed & Texted my friends about it"
3,Looking Dated,While the research contained in this book offer some interesting information much of the work looks very dated. While it was published in 1995 that is a very long time when it comes to neuroscience. Around that time there began an explosion of brain imaging studies using newly developed brain imaging technologies. This has allowed brain and behavior researchers to understand at a much deeper level the processes involved in for example emotion.I suggest looking at the very latest in publications. For example Joseph LeDoux (who has entries here that are head and shoulders above the other contributers)
5,There are not the words to describe this artists amazing ability...but I'll try!,"I am sold! I am now a die-hard fan of Sylvain Luc. Now that I have heard three releases, it is clear to me that Sylvain is one of the most amazing talents to ever record an album. He does things that if just about anyone else tried, it wouldn't sound as right as it does from Sylvain. He doesn't seem to have a strict sense of time and once you hear it, it makes perfect sense. He also has great tact and a perfect sense of tastefulness. He does just the right thing at just the right time. He doesn't seem to have a need to pull every one of his tricks out of his bag on every song like guitarist tend to do. All of the Sylvain Luc projects I have heard are of the highest aural quality. Even if you think you don't like Jazz, you will love Sylvain Luc."
5,MODERN JEWISH HISTORY THROUGH THE EXPERIENCES OF ONE FAMILY,"VERY WELL WRITTEN,(ALTHOUGH A TRANSLATION FROM FRENCH I BELIEVE).EXCITING. IT WOULD EVEN MAKE A GREAT MOVIE! THE COINCIDENCES WORK LIKE A DICKENS NOVEL. THE STORY WORKS WELL EVEN THOUGH I HAVE NOT AS YET READ ""THE BOOK OF ABRAHAM"", WHICH THIS IS A SEQUEL TO."
5,"From Africa, With Love","""From Africa, With Love"", takes you straight to the heart of Africa through the true life story of Herman X. Born to a single mother in the late 50s, he grows up with his grand parents from whom he learns some very high moral character. His youth experiences are facinating, informative, thrilling and exiteting.The death of his grand father is a turning point in his life, as he is sent abroad, where dispite all odds he focuses on his education, excels, and now lives the American dream.This book is and easy and entertaining read."
5,"Checkmate, Best of Season One....","For those of us who lived during this period of Black and white television we are extremely thankful for the COLOR we get now....But, I for one enjoy the black and white series of the 50s-60s....Here we have Sebastian Cabet, and Doug Mclure....Undoubtedly two of the most sexy gentlemen of the time....This and a couple of other series of the period were very defining as to what would soon be the norm for TV detective programs....I will add more later....red"
5,? closed captioning,I loved this show but will not be buying it until I determine whether it has subtitles. I have been stung too many times. I can't give a review of the DVD only of the show 5+.
5,Great for riding the bus,These earplugs do a great job at drowning out loud people snoring on the bus.
5,"Great Bag, Priced Right","A tripod bag is not a complicated item and I can not understand the $75 and more price tags on some. This bag is well made, uses good materials, and it holds and protects my tripod just fine. The padding is just right- not too bulky, not cheap and thin. Zipper is good quality. Size is right for my Gitzo 2540 with head attached. The pod fits with a little room for some other small gear. In short, it is a well made bag that does what it needs to do at a good price. What more can you ask from something as simple as a tripod bag?"
5,Very good protection!,"There are important things to a photographer that technology has developed: Zip Lock bags, Lithium Batteries, B & W C-41 processing film and Target for cheap camera cases (i.e. 6 Pack coolers that fits my 4x5 Field Camera: cost $6). So, this case is one of them. This case is built so well and so padded, it fits to my back like a glove. The base is built roomier than I needed for my Gitzo carbon fiber Mountaineer tripod, unitl I realized that I can fit my focusing hood and rain jacket in there.... This has turned into an overnight shoulder bag without evening realizing it. I have even shoved the toothbursh and towel in there. It is so lightweight, I rarely feel it. If I could improve upon it, I would add add a new color, dark blue. That's all."
4,Fits perfectly,"This is a well-made, nicely-padded, light-weight tripod case with ample room. The case fits myManfrotto 190CXPRO3 3-Section Pro Carbon Fiber Tripod without Headwith Manfrotto 322RC2 Horizontal Grip Action Ball Head with RC2 Rapid Connect Plate (3157N) perfectly without needing to adjust the ball head into a vertical position. On the outside pouch, I'm able to store an external flash (Nikon SB-600 Speedlight Flash for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras) plus a bunch of knick-knack like extra batteries,Nikon ML-L3 Wireless Remote Control for Nikon D40, D40x, D60, D80 & D90 Digital SLR Cameras, filters, etc. The case itself is padded on all sides except the top (short) side. The outside pouch is also padded in the front.As mentioned by another reviewer, the only thing this bag is missing is a padded shoulder pad. Overall, a great little bag for the tripod."
4,Great Case,"The case is high quality, very heavy material and I expect many years of service from it."
5,Incredible Results,"I was not blessed with the best in-class AP English preparation my senior year. We read a lot of novels, stories, and poems in one semester, without fully understanding the complexity of any of them. When May arrived, I was terrified of how poor education was going to ruin my performance. However, I began to read the Princeton Review guide, and slowly but surely, I began to learn ways to avoid the monotony that persistently pervades student essays about literature. I learned how to write lively, insightful, color-filled essays that were coherent. These are the type of essays that AP readers want. This is obviously true, because I received a 5 on my AP English Lit Exam against all odds. This book is both concise and witty, keeping you interested all the way through. Strategies for overcoming the pitfalls of the multiple-choice section are also provided. This one is a must-see-to-believe type of guide. Princeton Review, thanks!"
5,Good TV at an Excellent Price,I've had this T.V. for over a year with no problems. To the people who gave it a poor review based on the fact that it did not work remember that between 1% and 2% of all new items are defective regardless of the brand. It is a bad item if it has many recalls.
2,VERY POOR QUALITY CONTROL,"Bought this TV as a Christmas gift for my family. From the time of purchase to the time I finally rearranged my family room to accomidate this new unit it was over a month. I get the unit in place and turn it on only to find that the entire screen is not working. Needless to say I am extremeely disappointed. Now waiting for a part. If I had my way I would send it back and get a Sony like I should have.I consider this very poor quality control for such a large corporation. Stay tuned, you might see it on ebay."
1,IT HAS TO WORK TO HAVE VALUE,"Unit failed after 2 hours. Zenith internet expert no help and can't even tell where to take to have serviced. Zenith customer service promised to return telephone call but been waiting 3 days. Zenith implied no guarantee if purchaed on line. Made in Mexico, not famous for high tech. My recommendation: wait 2 more years and buy Phillips or Sony."
3,Firesign's Frankenstein album,"The Firesign Theatre released their sixth album in October 1972 on Columbia Records. The album is a hodgepodge of three different concepts edited together onto a single album. All three concepts are actually quite funny but it can be hard getting to know them the way the material is presented. I do think that the material would have been better served had it been split up into two separate releases. Very good to great stuff but poor editing. Still, what is here is very good even if the flow is uneven. The cd is available at Laugh.com."
2,Do not bother unless...,You are a RABID fan or a completist. This album contains inferior material than what they have on many other albums.
1,Havamal Words of the High One,"Very disappointing - a real waste of money: half of the ""book"" was blank pages. Why on earth did the publisher not add illustrations or make the print bigger and the bookcover smaller? Hardly worth keeping."
5,love it,I cannot begin to express how much I love this straightener! I used it the first time straight from the shower (no blow drying) on the hottest setting (due to thick wet hair) and it straightened and dried in the same amount of time it normally takes me to just straighten my hair. The next day I tried it on dry hair on a lower setting and it worked like any other straightener. So far I love it!
4,honestly flying on the lightness of a few notes,"The trumpet of Enrico Rava can be recognized from his own personal phrasing althought he comes from a minimalist tradition of trumpet players and great musicians such as Miles Davis and Chet Baker. His last work is a confirmation of a maturity and elegance which are giving us a few golden notes to live better. The interplay with the young italian world famous piano player, Stefano Bollani, is wonderfull and by themselves are sufficient in exploring the essence of the music. Paul Motian does not look like being at his best, he is not interplaying with the expected energy and decision to underline the wonderful moments Rava and Bollani are gifting us. The duo, Rava - Bollani, would have deserved 5 stars."
3,Great Lazy Day Music,"Though I was previously unfamiliar with Enrico Rava, I bought Tati after a recommendation from a fellow jazz aficionado who heard it online. I listened, read the reviews here, and listened again. Five stars? C'mon! Though Tati is an excellent CD to enjoy while kicking back on a lazy day, it doesn't come close to five-star status. It is so laid back that one could describe it as a barbiturate for the ears!That's not to say I don't like it. Tati is just fine, but there is not a single cut that truly stands out. I agree with those who would compare Enrico Rava's music to that of Chet Baker, Miles Davis, or even Tomasz Stanko and I will try out another of his recordings. But I will save Tati for cool, rainy days like today."
2,Boring,"Opener, The Man I Love, is lazy uncreative fare from a group interplay perspective but beautifully subtle and understated in term's of Rava's playing when listened to from a solo perspective. Next is Birdsong, a lazy, simplistic steal from Erik Satie's Trois Gymnopedies.Much of the piano improvising is old fashioned pap. Motian's drumming is often just plain irritating, responding in an often seemingly random way to the moment rather than evincing any thought to the overall structure of the music.""Ping pong jazz"" occurs at times where in the absence of any original way to respond you just echo what someone else has just played.A pity as Rava has such a beautiful expressive way with his horn, such a ravishing sound.The reason for the extra star is that the CD works for me as background music when I can just focus on Rava's keening yet easily digested poetry."
2,Lingering becomes languishing,"Exploiting Rava's breezy qualities a little too much for the worse, these underdeveloped if inoffensive laid back sketches are heavy on style but short on substance."
5,Please please please don't change the formula!,"Usually with reconstructors my hair ends up a little hard, so I have to end up deep conditioning with a moisturizing conditioner. However, this conditioner absolutely turned my hair around. I used to have lovely, low porosity (I actually liked the fact that it wasn't very porous) hair that became damaged through my physical activities -- wearing helmets, swimming in an overchlorinated pool, etc. My ends were an absolute mess. After a few trims and this treatment, my hair turned around. My hair was moisturized from the inside without it feeling coated, or leaving a film. It felt supple and healthy. I used a lot of conditioners before I found this one. Definitely a staple.One more thing, I see some reviews that say this conditioner isn't for Black hair, or for natural hair. I am African American and my hair is natural, so it really depends on your lifestyle, hair needs, etc. more than the texture of your hair."
3,I find that Smooth as Silk Xtreme is better,"I'm not sure that this product helps to fix/restore hair either...It is in actuality a very good hair treatment, but I tried Smooth as Silk Xtreme first, and it works for me better than the Nutrafix treatment."
2,River Boat,I Like The Series.But Who Ever Put It Together Did A Poor Job.There Is A Pluse In The Flim Sometimes.
1,Problems,I agree with Peter Williams. It was great to finally see some episodes of this long-forgotten series come out on DVD. BUT...the quality is apalling!! Discs 2 and 3 are full of pixelation problems...and the episode THE BLOWUP (on disc 2) jams...then jumps 6 minutes ahead. The result...a 48 minute episode plays for about 42 minutes...missing a few vital scenes in the middle of the episode. More care in mastering (or manufacturing) is required from Timeless Media before I'll be buying any more of their DVDs.
4,Riverboat discs now corrected !,"There was indeed major problems with the discs in this set,however they have since been all withdrawn by Timeless & the set has new pressings which play fine.You can now order this box with confidence."
2,Upgraded to 4 stars (Not as pictured!),I am changing my rating to a 4 star. I was using the wrong rowing technique. One has to use the Sculling Technique (I have only rowed in rowboats to fish). I wish the user guide would have technique instructions for this device. I searched the WEB for 'proper rowing technique' and found a great video explaining the sculling technique. Great workout! Kettler needs to improve the foot rest straps and the manual then it would be 5 stars. Amazon needs to put the proper picture on the product page and so does Kettler in its brochure! There was a design change to where the rowing bars attach to the shock absorbers to make it more robust.
2,Good machine - Dumb manufacturer,"The machine is fine. Amazon service is great.HOWEVER, there are tons of problems with the product.1. The product comes in a thin cardboard box with no protected foam or anything. The box I got in had so many holes and scratches during the shipment. Luckily none of the parts were damaged.2. MISSING PARTS. Like so many other reviews, mine came without the footrests. Even worse, it came with parts for BOTH right arms. I had to call Amazon CS and they had to ship me another one for me to complete the assembly.3. NO ENGLISH. The assembly instruction is all pictures with no english. You can still follow by looking at pictures but it's very easy to miss parts. The machine instruction has English but it makes no sense. And it doesn't even have any instruction on how to properly row the machine.OVERALL, the machine is fine but be prepared to go through headaches due to missing parts or wrong parts being shipped in flimsy cardboard box."
4,Provides a good workout,"I bought this rower about 6 months ago after comparing different ones. Decided to splurge on this as I thought it would give realistic feeling and be durable.Overall, I like the rower - it's built solid and has smooth operation. It takes 1-2 hours to put together. Unfortunately, we were missing a small, but important part - had to call customer service - called on a Friday and got the part Monday. In the meantime, I was so impatient that I went to Lowes and found a part that would work so I could start using it immediately.The only cons about it are the straps for the feet - they do tend to come loose after a little while - could probably be easily fixed with something else.The only other con is the placement of the feet. I do wish that I could adjust them a little bit in terms of position.Otherwise, I've enjoyed the rower and think it will last many years."
4,"smooth, natural motion","This is an amazingly comfortable, quiet machine to use. The assembly instructions might have been a bit clearer, but we managed."
1,Defective Weld. Poor Quality Control.,"The weld of the support beneath the seat to the main bar was crooked so it was impossible to assemble the rower. I am returning it and looking for a different rower. I do not trust the quality control of a company that would send out a product with such a major defect. I received the rower on time however the packaging is poor, pieces stuffed somewhat haphazardly into a cardboard box. It almost looked like a re-packaged item."
2,Cheaper Elsewhere,"I found it $30 cheaper on another site. I liked the reviews here and shopped around and found a better deal. Once it arrived, it was a great machine. Took an hour or two to put together, not a big deal. I took it slow and patient and everything fit properly. The quality is excellent, not thin tinny parts, but solid machinery. It's whisper quiet, so you can enjoy television while rowing. It's small when wide open, and the arms fold back even farther for easy storage. The only problem is the data panel -- the booklet instructions are in some inscrutable language, so I never learned how to use the buttons on the panel. That's ok, though, because it gives you elapsed time and number of reps, and I don't really need a lot more data when I'm rowing. Also, the data panel kind of slides on to the top of the machine and sits between your knees. If you bump it while rowing, it can get loose or pop off. But overall, this is an excellent machine, well worth the money."
1,NOT SATISFIED,The rowing machine is in GERMAN. I can't use this at all!! NOT HAPPY WITH PURCHASE. Spent a lot of money on something I can't read or understand.
3,"Nice machine, but some issues","Upon delivery by UPS, I noticed the box torn and taped at one end. I assumed something would be missing and it was (a nut used to keep the oars open, and in place) so until I get another, the machine is useless.Next, I when I opened the box, i noticed how poorly packaged everything is. Some cardboard that was supposed to be between the metal parts have shifted and everything was rubbing against each other. Thank goodness there were not too many scratches. Finally, the instructions were for the most part in German with some English, it was easier to follow the illustrations and parts numbers to assemble. Of course if anything can go wrong it will, and the oars are not marked as left or right and fit perfectly on the wrong side! I had to dissasemble to bolts holding the oars, the shocks and move from one side to the other. It seems to be a well built machine, but won't know for sure until I find a suitable nut to lock the arm in place"
3,"Good product, poor pricing and packaging","Good product should get many good years of service. Packaging, however is terrible. The package arrived in more than fair condition. There was absolutely zero padding to protect parts and exposed bolts. Fortunately parts that were floating loose in the box were retrieved. One of the special locking bolts was so badly damaged I had to recut the threads to make it work. Probably should have sent it back, but it was easier for me to repair it. I also have a bone to pick with Amazon. The day after I received it the price was marked down $100! There is no recourse and you are just out of luck; ""Sorry"". Keep that in mind, you might want to monitor the pricing."
1,Arko bin dividers,"Even though they are advertised as Arko dividers, they appeared to be counterfeits. Very poor fit nor are they as thick as my original Arko dividers. All they have stamped on them is a part number. There is no manufactures name on it like my originals. If you decide to by them, be prepared to glue them in with good glue. I sent the junk back."
2,Crazy School Assignment,"This book had a very good theme to it, but it was very crazy and hard to follow. I would not recommened for young readers, but for older ones who have extra time on their hands. Overall it is an okay book."
3,Occasionally Helpful,"Works fine as a polarizer. Trying to change the plane of polarization seems to have a very insignificant effect, unlike some B+W filters.Generally makes pictures really dark, unless you increase the exposure but keep the camera *incredibly* stable.For the price it is okay."
5,Circular polarized,Gave it 5 stars because it is adjustable and works great. Took some pictures with it right away and saw a great difference in the quality. Really happy with the purchase.
5,great filter,Took this filter to Egypt and Kenya. It was very easy to use and pictures came out great! thanks for the fast service!
2,Another buyer with a broken filter,"I bought this filter, and it was fine for three months, but then while out shooting it came apart in my hand, meaning the half of the filter that you rotate separated from the half that screws to your lens. The C-clip that holds the two halves together went flying, but I managed to find it. Unfortunately, it ended my shooting day, because the C-clip is coated with a thin oil that splattered all over my lens, and was impossible to remove without a strong cleaner.When I got home, I managed to snap the two halves back together, and managed to clean my lens, but the actual filter is almost impossible to clean, because when you wipe it, your cloth will touch the edge of the filter and pick up more oil, so you end up fouling the glass again.I've contacted the seller to see about a replacement. The filter works well, but could use a bit better QC."
4,Filters for beginners,"I am just a week end photo fan. use an olympus E620 which is a great system. Live on Lake Erie, shoot a lot around the water. There are hundreds of filters on the market, Reading on line this was considered a good basic filter to start with. This filter makes a big difference shooting sky/water photos, Great definition, great contrasts. easy to use. Not understanding the hundreds of filters available I can only say this filter is really helpful for a novice. Steve in Cleveland"
1,Falls apart.,"I placed this on my camera. Used if for two days, great pics. BUT, I was removing it and it fell apart, the filter ring, the wire, and the polarizer -- all came apart. Here I am, out of the country and I had to buy another and have it shipped for $35.00. Do not buy this."
5,Great Filter,This filter is made of great quality I highly recommend it to any photographer looking to spice up their images.
4,"Decent product, made in Philippines instead of Japan (as shown in pic)","The product is of decent quality, and rotating the filter while shooting at 90 degree to the sun light provides the best effect. Did not encounter significant amount of glare even though this is not Hoya HMC coated.Only surprise: display picture for item on Amazon list the item as made in Japan, maybe due to the vendor (DBROTH), but the received product is actually made in Philippine.Overall the product does what it's made to do."
5,Great transaction!,Product was in good condition and works as described. Shipping and packing was good too.
5,Good starter filter.,"Well, I think this polarized filter is probably the best for the price. I'm brand new to DSL' and I kept stumbling over discussion's about polarized filter's and went looking for one. It's true that you get what you pay for. Theres less expensive ones and certainly more expensive circular polarized filter's. There seemed to be a big jump in price (maybe around $60.00)from this price to a better quality filter. So, for your first try at using a polarized filter's, I think this is a fair price. Granted theres better quality out there."
3,Its ok,"The filter does what it is supposed to do.It does not have the white marker that you see in the pic. I prefer the white marker because it provides a good point of reference. Sad that it is missing.Also, the rotation is tight. This causes the lens to rotate when the filter is turned. This is very frustrating as it moves the lens out of focus by turning the filer. Hoping that it will loosen up after using the filter for a bit."
1,DO NOT BUY,After spending all that money and using it twice the ring came off of the filter. Now I have a pice of JUNK.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!
5,high resolution,"First, buy a polarizer of another brand but distorted and Comrade D3100 enfocr could not zoom the objects. But this filter is excellent. The saturation is the best. It is noted that amteriales are of the highest quality. No doubt Hoya is best. The downside is the price since it is costly"
4,Works Great - Excellent Price,"Not much else to say outside of the title ""Works Great - Excellent Price"".The rotation of the circular polarizer is a little stiff out of the box, but I suppose that is a good thing as it's only going to get looser with use.Get a nice polarized effect on both water or sky in pictures taken thus far.Definitely a good value for your 58mm attachments."
3,Ok,"Wish I had bought the better polarizer, this one doesn't do as much as the older smaller one I had for another camera."
2,Not what it used to be,"I purchased my oven in June '09 hoping it would be the same excellent quality of my former (same model) oven. I am very disappointed in the construction of thin, poorly insulated metal causing excessive EXTERIOR heat. You cannot touch this machine once heated. The motor is noisey, it rattles continuously, and the expansion/contraction sounds continue.The door hinges do not have a ""stop"" - the door just flops open falling onto the countertop unlike the older ovens. The oven bakes well; the size, both interior & exterior, are excellent being the primary reason I purchased this model again. Over the years I have owned West Bend toasters, roasters & coffee pots always very pleased with the products and loved my former ""toaster oven"" model 74706!I could not recommend the current West Bend #74706 until construction quality is improved. This is a manufacturer problem, not AMAZON."
1,Disappointed,"The Rotisserie was nice, made some nice juicy chicken.I enjoyed this product for the few months it actually worked.Their customer service department is simply a JOKE. Rude and helpless a total waste of my and their time...would NOT buy this brand again."
2,Too hot handle,"After unpacking and reading all the enclosed material, I did the initial breaking or burning the oil off the parts. The oven took about 20 minutes to reach 350 deg. but by then I afraid to go any higher. This oven was hotter outdide than in. I've had other simular ovens in the past that where not close to being this poor at retaining heat. Send it back."
4,very good price for UV filter,"Seller had the best price for the inexpensive UV filter, however, it was not shipped until the anticipated arrival date - no explanation for the delay in shipping."
3,Filter lost,"This filter now rests at the bottom of the Caribbean Sea - does that make it a fisheye filter now? Seriously, I can't be sure who's at fault, but over several weeks of use, the filter obviously unscrewed itself and one evening as I took off the lens cap to take a sunset shot, over the edge of the balcony went the filter.Interestingly, I suspect the loss was a good thing. I noticed that dawn/sunrise pictures of a particular island were extremely blue, while I had no 'blue' problems after the filter took a dive. I regret polluting the waters more than its loss, and I think I'll try a different brand (and type) when I replace it."
1,Don't waste your money,"Don't waste your money on this CD. It is filled with dialogue; if I wanted dialogue, I would have bought the DVD. Terrible, terrible, terrible."
4,Floored,"They'll hold a half gallon of slush apiece, great if you live in cold climates. They're a little large for my back seats, but they're flexible enough to bend and fit in anyway.They give your whole car fresh rubber smell. Hopefully that will dissipate during the summer."
2,"calming, relaxation and nudity","I ordered this dvd based on the discreption given. It read calming, relaxing vision. It should include that there is nudity. I was hopeing to play this in the waiting room at my massage practice. There are scence of water falls, bubbleing water and some massage that looks more instructional than sexual. Then there is a scene of a women in a hot tub bathing her legs over and over and another scene of a very oily bronze body with the butt exposed. Not what I was looking for. It does come with a cd that is the music to the dvd. It is too changing and highs and lows in the sounds for the massage room."
3,Its okay for those who do not excercise,"I thought I was going to need something very soft to begin my post pregnancy workouts since Ia had a csection but it turned out that I didnt really. At my 6 wk doc clearance, I did the first 2 groups of excercises once and then went up to the 3rd group. By the 4th day I was a little bored. Before my pregnancy i was an active person and enjoyed yoga, pilates, weights and dancing so this was slow for me. But if you wanna start slow, dont normally workout or had a difficult delivery then this might work best for you."
5,Great post natal workout,This workout is a really great place to get started with working out again after delivery. The exercises Erin walks you through are especially designed to work the muscles which were hit the hardest by pregnancy.
3,Not as good as Erin Brien's prenatal DVD.,Not as good as Erin Brien's prenatal DVD. It's good for someone who just had a baby. I find it too easy.
2,Works better for me as a body cleanser...,"This soap seemed to give my complexion a matte finish, although it did next to nothing for acne. I'm now using it as a body cleanser, just so it doesn't go to waste. It prevents bacne, but I won't go to the trouble of purchasing this product again."
2,"Eh,","I bought several bars, I don't think it really helped. Plus you go around smelling like rotten eggs, no joke. Lathers well though."
3,As good as any,"This soap works to a point, cleared up my acne a little bit, I still get breakout but not as bad as i used to, it's partly my fault cause my family is known for having overly oily skin bad acne problems.This soap smells awful, you kinda get used to it but then again you don't want to go around smelling like rotted eggs.WARNING!! The Sulfur part of this soap will tarnish certain jewelry metals, I have had two silver rings and a silver and stainless neckless cross turn black after using this soap regularly . sulfur is known for blackening of certain metals..."
4,"Works for my acne, not for controlling oil","I am in my early 40s and bought this soap after reaching my wits end with what I chalked up as adult acne but a few days before consulting with a dermatologist. Without my mentioning Grandpa's sulfur soap, my dermatologist wrote a prescription for a prescription strength sulfur soap, stating that the sulfur has antiseptic properties and kills the bacteria that collects on my face and, along with oil, clogs the pores. I use both the prescription strength and Grandpa's sulfur soap once each a day. I find the lather of Grandpa's better removes the traces of oil and makeup from the day so I use it at night before going to bed. I have not had one break out since. However, I was hopeful that it would reduce the production of oil but I don't find it the least bit overdrying as some have previously indicated."
1,Only has Games 1 & 2,"I'm not sure who's fault is it, but the DVD only had the first two of the five games for this match. When Amazon sent a replacement, it had the same problem. I e-mailed NCAA OnDemand to inquire, but they never e-mailed me back."
4,I liked it alot.,"I bought this book and have to say I enjoyed it alot. It was a cool and original story with fantastic artwork. The story gets kind of shaky at times with complicated and confusing panels thrown in, but overall it was enjoyable and I do recommend it to any Manga fan."
2,"""Grand Mal"" Lives Up To Its Name","A ""Grand Mal"" is actually a type of severe seizure, one of which I almost had when I read this story. The literal Latin translation is ""Big Bad,"" which is also quite adequate to describe this trashy little thing. This is camp in the extreme. The story (if there is one) relies on sheer stupidity and lunacy to drive itself along. Without spoiling the comic, suffice it to say that its explanations for events before, and pertaining to, the ""Bubblegum Crisis"" series are lame, biased, and unbelievable, at best. The only redeeming value is that it features a series that has a startlingly small number of comics with it. The art is sort of lacking, too."
1,Avoid at all costs,"This comic is terrible, in fact that's doesn't go far enough. The story is rubbish and puts in details that are not supported by the OVA series. The charaters are bland and boring and in some cases the spelling of their names has been changed. Adam Warren cannot, no matter how hard he tries draw otaku manga, he should give up and try something else. And he can't write neither."
2,finally trashed,"this dvd player is the worst. I bought it at a bargain price, but what a mistake!the dvd drawer opens REALLY slow!some DVD's don't work, althought hey work just fine with my other DVD player.it takes a long time for the dvd player to actually start playing the disc.I'll give it 2 stars because it was cheap and it's nice to look at. I gave it to my friend and he already gave it to charity.a real P.O.S.I'm happy with my new Sony 1 disc player. it's fast and plays all of my dvd's."
5,Hakuba AS-LL,"This is the my sixth purchase of Hakuba camera cases and the second of this model (AS-LL). It is a ideal case with moderate expense for a case of this quality. It is not a Pelican, but adequate."
4,Great Product,The Bugflector was super easy to install and has worked beautifully thus far. The only disappointment I had was I thought it would cover the entire front of the car not just the strip in the very front. I would highly recommend this particularly for the price.
3,Great ... until it broke,I bought this toy for my twin 1 year old girls for Christmas this year even though I didn't have a good experience with other Manhattan Toy toys. They loved it and it helped to teach them to put things in and take things out of a container. Well the sound quit working after 3 1/2 months. We tried replacing the batteries to no avail. Prior to it breaking I would have given it 5 stars. FYI - this is the second expensive Manhattan Toy that broke for no reason shortly after purchasing it.
1,Broken already!,"Gave to my granddaughter for Christmas. Only worked for a short time. Of course, too late to return! Would not recommend buying."
2,Very Disappointed,"Although I am constantly checking the reviews for products I purchase, I almost never write one myself. However, this time I am so disappointed not only with the product but also the manufacturer that I am compelled to leave one. This toy was purchased for my son for Christmas, however by March the toy had completely stopped working. We changed the batteries, but to no avail. We have since attempted to contact Manhattan Toy to see if they would rectify the situation or suggest a way to fix the toy. They NEVER responded to a single one of our messages. The only reason I gave this toy two stars is because my son still loves to play with the animals. If the toy only worked, I think we would be giving it five stars. But as it is, it broke within three months and the company has failed to even show a scintilla of customer service."
1,Has design flaws and broke after a month,"This toy is adorable and I think it is an excellent learning tool. The animals are sweet and the voice that states each ones name is appealingly young. However, the door never stays open which is frustrating for myself and my one year old. The on/off switch is unnecessarily hidden. Then, it suddenly stopped working after about a month of play. New batteries were put in and I got one more monkey sound, then it died again. So disappointing!"
1,The toy broke within a few weeks,The toy did seem pretty neat - until it broke a couple of weeks later :-(..No sounds anymore..Also the on/off switch was impossible for my 1 year old to find (frankly it was hard for me too - it's very hidden)/.
4,Best Resource for Serious Criminal Investigators,"The need for an accurate, fair book on this subject for criminal justice and law enforcement has been absent for a long time. Mr Kail has pulled together a top-notch investigative and research tool that will weather well over time and continue to be a valuable handbook for years to come."
1,"Obvious Bias, Lack of Qualification","There are numerous reports that can debunk most, if not all, of the ideas presented in this book. A far better (free) report on this type of thing is ""The Lanning Report"", by Kenneth Lanning, an FBI Agent who used to work specifically with ritual abuse cases. Google for it & check it out; I promise you'll be glad that you didn't waste your money on this piece of junk."
5,A Real Problem Solver...,"Having been born into a law enforcement family - and having been a part of the magical community for over thirty years - all I can say is, ""Hooray for Tony Kail!"" This book makes huge strides in clearing up many of the misunderstandings between law enforcement and those who embrace alternative religious paths. Had it been around when I first discovered Wicca, many of the problems we encountered wouldn't have been problems at all.All I can hope is that this book becomes standard issue for every patrol car in this country - and a staple in the library of anyone even remotely considering an alternative spirituality."
1,Total waste of time,This is just another rehash of old urban legends. Don't waste your time or money.
1,A Supreme Court says otherwise,"A friend referred me to the book in question. Horrible read. Most importantly, how is it earth centered traditions that have God and spiritual evolution at their center end up lumped with Satanism? The Supreme Court upheld the rights of worshippers of indigenous faiths. The U.S. Library of Congress no longer catalogs indigenous book topics with satanic topics. A number of medical associations and pharmaceutical companies work with traditional priests to learn more about herbal medicinal treatments of modern illnesses, any more questions? Any self respecting law officer with real insight into the Santeria or Wiccan community wouldnt have written such a book. The author is out of material gain. Period. My suggestion: Throw it in the trash, with all the other racist and bigoted books on religion."
4,Interesting debut,"Impossible Recording Machine's debut Axioms is an interesting piece of work. The songs, although broken into three groups(these parts are still intermixed) blend together well.Standouts are 'Compulsive 3,' 'The Bells,"" 'Safety in Numbers,' & 'The Soft Wire.'Both 'The Bells' and 'Safety in Numbers' are among the songs on the album that have vocals (only select songs do) and stand out as intelligent sounding pop songs. The songs are not only listener friendly but also invigoratingly fresh, not the kind of recycled sound so common to current pop music.'Copulsive 3' is a fast powerfully energetic track that could be considered a 'dance' tune in the club scene except for one fact, it is humanly impossible to keep up with this track.Overall a great album, has a few slow points, but for the most past is an amazing conceptual disc and I can't wait to see where this leads."
1,Save your money,"HOME AT MAYBERRY is a collection of SEASON THREE episodes that have been available (public domain) in various formats (VHS and DVD) for quite some time. Season three has recently been announced as available this August (I believe the 16th). I have already pre-ordered the set and am awiting the release of seasons four through eight.Unless you are totally without patience, and have to have it NOW, I would recommend waiting for the August release date and not spend money only get the entire season again in two months.There are, of course, some wonderful episodes in this set, but with fans of TAGS that goes without saying.I would not recommend purchasing HOME AT MAYBERRY or any other TAGS ""collections"" at this time."
1,Bad joke?,"This gotta be a joke. Other 64MB MP3 players with expansion, from Now Evolution, etc., cost as little as 1/5 as much, and has much better sound. I truly think this player is a cruel joke for people who know nothing about technology."
4,Really Good Stuff!!,"This is really good groove-based jazz! Mystery Feet fall into that space that I really like between straight-ahead jazz, groove, and fusion. Larry Coryell's influence is strong, appearing on one song and writing another, which steers the band towards more straight-ahead jazz. The other tunes show strong guitar work, Hammond organ, and groove-oriented bass that adds up to a good album."
1,Dangerous Diplomacy,"Dangerous Diplomacy related to Saudi royal family endangering America's National Security is the another hoax/cabal I have recently come across. America's National Security is more threaten by the neonazi-zionist axis and their civilian moles in Pentagon and their selected robot in the white house. Writer seems to me as acting like a spokesmen for MOSAD propaganda division chief, in Washington D.C.The author's communication is miserable at best. Some valid arguments, which he most certainly did his best to loose by resorting to so many negative stereiotypes which are old and commonly used by the jewish lobby and their cronies to smoke screen the facts.While I was never fond of Saudi royal family or any so-called royal family...but trying to relate them directly to America's Security is nothing but dirty politics.I would love to read this writer's next book ""Truth About AIPAC & Their Hidden Pac's in U.S.A."" if any,"
4,computer hookup note,"On the RGB hookup to a computer, a previous poster was wrong that this display won't work with low resolutions. In fact, It will work at up to 1280x1024. Here's the trick- the Sampo will display ""Out of range"" also if the ""Hertz"" on the monitor is set too high.Try this: From XP, go to ""display"" in the control panel. Click setting tab, then click the advanced button. From Vista, go to personalization in the control panel, then choose display settings. Click ""Advanced Settings"". Now click the Monitor tab. Change from 85 hertz to 60 hertz. You should now be able to display high resolutions on the Sampo without the ""out of range"" error message."
4,Sampo LME-15S1 generic remote,"I found a universal remote that works the LME 15S1, Symphonic VCR and Lasonic DVD player. It is a GE RM24927 at OfficeMax, TV code 046 under Sampo."
4,Sampo LME 15S1,I saw this flat screen TV .... It works great in both modes. The only trouble is that no other generic remote will operate it as stated in another review.
4,A Guidebook for when you return,"I am a frequent visitor to Vienna. While I'm there, Iuse a guidebook that focuses on food and drink, a citymap and one of the weekly papers (Der Falter). But whenI return, I enjoy the rumination and reminiscence ofthis book.I'm particularly pleased that it incorporates informationabout the natural setting of the city and I find the culturalinformation to be useful if brief. A great book for reminiscence.--Lynn Hoffman, author of THE NEW SHORT COURSE IN WINE andthe forthcoming novel bang BANG from Kunati Books.ISBN 9781601640005"
2,Pretty but hard to use,"This is perhaps the worst-arranged guidebook I've encountered. It skips baseline information in preference for beautiful illustrations. There are many nuggets of information about the city's history and culture - including 11 pages on its birds and squirrels - but you're left not knowing that the city is divided into numbered districts, that you have to get your subway tickets time-stamped, and how to tip. Impractical, frustrating and not worth the room in your suitcase."
3,Simplistic but Worth a Glance,"As the Great Fire of London burned the city to ashes in 1666, this book was read to distraught onlookers by a man named Jospeh Van dar Lippen. It is said he inherited it from his great x2 grandfather and that it orginated in medieval times. It is a book of wisdom intended to give people insight into their life's situations. It has an interesting layout as described above.It is valuable as a curiosty and nothing more. The ""pearls"" of wisdom are mostly common sense--though it is good to be reminded of them sometimes--and are easily understood despite the archaic phrasing. You will probably read through it once and put it on the coffee table as a discussion peice. I can't see how it can be used as a tool to help you with your every-day life.If you collect things of this nature, then I say it's worth the purchase. Othewise see if your local library has a copy."
5,Not an expert be compared to Chicago Cutlery this is amazing.,"Be careful, if you have been using a normal knife this is like having a 12"" brand new extra sharp razor. This transforms the act of chopping. All I can say is why did I wait so long to get a good knife. You do have to wash/oil and store this knife to keep it sharp. I also love the sound it makes :-)"
2,"Not really a book, not really about Cap Anson","Cap Anson 2 is actually about another 19th century baseball star, Mike ""King"" Kelly ! It has no narrative flow at all, it's just a massive collection of newspaper snippets about Mike Kelly. For a real book about the great, flamboyant player, I suggest you read the original bio of Kelly, from Scarecrow Press' Sports History series. It's by Marty Appel, a real author."
5,You can't eat just one!,These are crispy wafers filled with coffee flavored chocolate cream between layers. They are light and not filling but very tasty. This is a longtime family favorite spanning several generations. It's too easy to eat the whole box. It's made in Canada and not found in the USA except through the internet.
3,Coffee Crisps,I enjoyed the bars but there were half a dozen of them that had the wrapping opened so we did not eat those but the rest were very enjoyable. I have never had this issue ordering from here before. I may have to go back to my other source. I have never had any trouble from them ever and my mom always loves them.Thanks for inquiring.
2,Product Was Watery and Had a Strange Odor,"Nioxin has discontinued this product, so the containers I got may have been old. It was shipped during a hot spell, so it is possible that the product was damaged by the heat during shipping. In any event, I was unable to use the product. (I have used it for years so I know what it was supposed to be like.) The seller promptly refunded my full cost including shipping and apologized that I was disappointed. The seller also didn't require me to waste my time sending back an unusable product."
5,Why I love Nioxin Smoothing Reflective Pure Shine Gel,"This hair gel is unlike any other one I have ever used -- and I have tried many of them. It not only gives a shine to your hair but it also serves as a way to keep your hair style in place. Recently I learned that Nioxin was no longer making that particular product so when I saw that it was available on Amazon, I bought all but four left in the site's inventory. Now I wish I bought the entire inventory. It seems that whenever a product gets popular, the manufacturer stops producing it!!!! This has happened to me on numerous occasions and I have heard the same thing from many people. Doesn't matter if its a lipstick shade, nail polish shade, eyeshadow or hair enhancement product. Makes me crazy!"
2,"Not good for fine hair, almost like glue","This is heavy and makes my hands sticky when applying it. Nioxin is for fine and/or thinning hair. This doesn't ""shine"" it just takes the fluff out of my hair and makes it lay flat. Not at all what I was expecting. In general, I love their products, have been using them for years.. but will never order this again."
1,Buyers Beware !!!,"Unless I'm mistaken, this is only the second volume of a two-volume set. See my comments under the other ""Exposition of First Peter by John Brown"" published by Sovereign Grace Publishers and sold on Amazon."
5,Hard charging energetic tech-house.,"I love this tune and it is very.......uplifting. You have got great rhythms and even better vocals. I'm not a big vocals guy, but I took the time to come and tell you this is a gimmie. I'm still trying to figure out why it hasn't got more play here. A definite for the late-night."
3,these sheets are ok...,"But the colors are not as vivid as they seem, and the sheet fits very poorly on a standard crib mattress, and is not very soft and cozy at all."
1,Do not buy,Just before my 1 year warranty expired I was having a large blue streak run across the bottom of my screen. No on site tech available so I had to take the TV in myself. It turns out the $2500 light engine was going out and I was supposed to have the TV back in 5-6 days. Zenith contacted me after 30 days and said they would get me approved for a new TV or give me my money back since the part was not available. It has now been an additional 15 days and no word from Zenith. No call backs. I am starting to wonder if I will get anything at all. I sincerely don't want another Zenith and would prefer to get the cash so I can buy a TV with better customer support. I really don't like the thought of going through this again in a year from now as it seems that Zenith is having a lot of similar problems.
1,"Blue Haze - In the shop also, for 2 MONTHS","After calling LG/Zenith I got the 'we're not responsible but we'll fix your set for free' certified letter. The local repair company began installing the new light engine in my living room but found after complete disassembly that the new engine was not correct and would not work. He loaded up my set and took it to get another engine, he claims to be on the 4th light engine from LG since each one is either wrong for the set or won't work upon installation. I hope they take care of this no matter if the problem is their parts or their choice of repairman or I'll be the one starting the class action!"
2,Should have bought a sony,"It seems that i'm not the only one that has had a problem with this tv. I've been through two of these tv's, the first within 3 months, still under warranty thank god!! and now the second one is needing repair not even 2 years later. Of course it's not under warranty anymore so now i'm in the same boat as everyone else. A tv with a bunch of blue lines and such."
1,This TV is an absolute Lemon,"I like most of the other people am extremely dissapointed in this TV. I had a great reception for the first year and litterally less than a month after the warranty was up The bottom started to turn all blue. I have now owned this set for 1 1/2 years and 40 percent of the set is blue and now it is streaking blue on other parts of the screen. This was a $3200 TV set when we bought it. I think there should be a class action law suit, this is unjustifiable. People do not pay this much money for a TV that does not last even 2 years."
1,Junk,"Please do not by this product. After 1 1/2 years blue line appears, then slowly takes over the entire screen. Price to repair, $3100.00. They will not stand behind there lemons, and therefore will lose in the long run. By word of mouth and the internet this could hurt Zenith & LG for a long time. GOOD. The only reason they got one star is because there is no zero to pick from on this site."
1,Repaired Twice!!!!,"Mine did the same as all of the others, blue screen the works, less then a year after purchase. Under warranty the entire contents of the light engine have to be replaced. Now a year and a half later the exact same issue. I did purchase extended warranty so I didn't have to pay for the repair. So, here is the deal guys. If you buy this TV which by the way when working properly does have a nice picture better buy it form some place that offers an extended warranty like for 4 yrs and that includes a lemon policy. That way you end up with a new TV after they have fixed it 3 times....BECAUSE they will. I want a different too what a piece of junk. The thing is it was just released before the technology was ready. So lets admit it and make it right!!! I'll at least respect you that way."
1,I was ripped off too.,"I purchased the 44"" version of this TV back in June 04. Within 6 months the dreaded blue line appeared at the bottom. An LG rep on another forum confirmed that excessive heat causes the plastic lens mounts to warp after awhile.(He has since deleted all his posts) I can't post a URL but do a search on E44W46LCD + TriodeGuy and you will find my posts on the other forum. There is a fix for the blue line problem that doesn't require light engine replacement. Please see my posts for details. There is also mention from another poster of a class action lawsuit in Jersey."
3,They Break,"They are cute, but as the other reviewer said, they break with almost no provocation under normal play conditions."
