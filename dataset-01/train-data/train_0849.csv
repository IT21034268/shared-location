4,"A great book for kids, except...","This is a great book for kids and will hopefully get my neice and nephew interested in history, which is a subject I dearly love and enjoy reading about. My only objection is to the vocabulary. There are High School graduates out there, however sad it may be, that would need a dictionary to help them with this book. Much less preteen kids! I would like to hope that my neice and nephew will do exactly that, use a dictionary (more likely the internet, I suppose) or ask their parents for help - but I just don't know."
5,wonderful easy to read history book,What a breath of freash air! A history book written from a different point of view. It reads as if you are being read a story by your grandfather. If we do not learn from history we are doomed to make the same mistakes. A must read.
5,Amazing & Truly Unusual,A truly wonderful way to get young children interested in history. A must read for parents and grand parents who love to read or tell bed time stories. It opened my curiosity to look for ways to explain and tell stories to my 3 year old grand daughter.
3,A history of a little of the world,"I was recommended this book on the basis that it offered a broader view of world history than was typically taught (Egypt to Greece to Rome to Dark Ages to French Revolution). Unfortunately, this is exactly the trajectory that this book takes. For a book that claims to be a little history of the world, India and China barely rate a mention. A more appropriate title is perhaps ""A history of a little of the world"".In fairness, the book was written in the 1930s. The prose is still beautifully written and enjoyable to read. I just wish there was more ""world"" in it."
5,Excellent,Bought it for the kids to listen too during long drive. Could not have been more impressed. Started listening to it myself. Excellent content and excellent delivery.
2,its a history of europe,"Misleading title. Its just a history of Europe. That why it fails. Great civilizations / countries like China, Japan, India , North America, South America and even Russia are ignored or dismissed in a few lines. Looks like the author was actually living in the middle ages. He seems to have little idea that there was a big world beyond the boundaries of the European continent. A few chapters on the rest of the world would have helped. Keeping this aspect aside, the book is OK. Easy to read. Easier to forget."
2,"A very light and simple read, written in another time and age - updated 12-2010","The concept sounded great, but I really can't recommend this book. It's very euro-centric, too simple and light for adults, and unless you read it aloud to your kids, so they can ask questions and get explainations that are missing, not readable for a young adult. It was clearly written in another time and age and it shows. And stopping as it does at 1945 or so, it's missing a little history to say the least.Updated 12-2010So I saw that so many people found this book to be 5 stars, and only 5 of 9 people felt this review was helpful, I reread the book. I am just as convinced then ever - it is out of date, missing entire cultures(and not minor ones), not interesting enough for a child and too simple for an adult. Perhaps I've read too much history to find the value in this book. I would even say that even one of the Dummy books would be a better read then this."
4,An excellent book with some drawbacks,"This is an excellent introductory book of world history. Some categorize this as a children's book, I disagree. Although the text is easy to read, some passages are not straight forward and are filled with so many history facts that I doubt children can digest all of them at once.I enjoyed reading this book as an adult, and would surely recommend it to people who are looking for an Introduction to World History. However, when I have finished reading it, I felt as though this book is still missing something that I wished it had provided."
2,This author did insert opinions.,"I read the other reviews and decided to try this book. From the reviews, I thought this would not be written from any particular worldview. It is. This author did provide facts and he did insert his opinions. I bought this book to read out loud to my children. I only read the first half of the book to myself and stopped. I kept trying to find a reason to share this book with my children. The information provided was better provided in the VP History Cards. Here is one quote of advice that the author offered, ""One day - but there's no hurry - you may come to read the Bible"". (pg. 25) One book review from the book says it well, ""Gombrich opens with the most magical definition of history I have ever read... Tolerance, reason and humanity.... suffuse every page of the Little History"" by Amanda Vickery, Guardian Review."
5,Great for 15 months!,"My son received this gift for Xmas and continues to hunt for it in his toy box - he loves it, but does have difficulty putting the blocks in. Not only does he enjoy this toy, mom does too because I can hear a variety of things and not just a song. My son, loves trying to repeat what's said! This toy is a ""keeper"""
2,It's a sinker....,"My daughter recieved this toy as a christmas present and I thought she would love it. But, she won't even give it a second look. First of all, the pieces do not fit in it very well and I think she gets a little frustrated with it. Secondly, I can't find a volume switch! Those toys that come with a volume switch are wonderful!"
4,A great starter book,"This picture book has a lot going for it: the story is about a penguin, if your child likes penguins then Osbert's story is a place for them to start reading. The story line is simple enough to glue a [...] to the page, yet magical enough to keep an [...] interested.Osbert is a classic penguin, full of mischief and naive energy. He is a lovable character.Elizabeth Cody Kimmel writes with a consistent style. It is a great little book that's sure to please parents and pre-reader age children.The illustrations and art direction by H.B. Lewis are very nice indeed, in some instances truly wonderful. This is a book that will stay in your child's library for a long, long time."
5,My 6yo's Favorite Christmas Book,"Beautiful story and wonderful illustrations. Definitely warms the heart to share this one with your kids. Very original and sweet. We look forward every December to cracking this one open.BTW, the listed reading level on this book is not quite right. I'd say most 7yo's and many 6yo's can handle this one."
4,Small but great!,"I already knew that I loved this book, but I just wasn't expecting such a small-sized book to arrive. It's about the size of oone of the old Golden books. I probably should have read more about what I was getting. Regardless, it's a great story that my kids love!!!"
1,Agri-Cover 10150 XT-Dial Tension Adjuster Kit,Door hinge for 3 bucks does a better job. They wont hold in cold weather or bad wind. I would not recomend useing the original product. My orignal cover blew off going down the road because they failed.
4,A personal account of life in command of a U Boat.,"This author commanded a series of German U Boats throughout WW2 and this is his own personal story. The photographs are also from his own personal collection and are, therefore, unlikely to have been published elsewhere. The Maps, however, could so easily be improved.In Part One of this book, Herbert Werner takes the reader through the glorious years of success after success for both Germany and her U Boat offensive. In Part Two, however, we reach that turning point in the war which he aptly describes as ""Above us Hell."" Finally, Part 3 is equally effectively described as ""Disaster to Defeat.""An interesting and well written account of the U Boat war of WW2 - not only because the author actually took part, but also because he was fortunate enough to survive that war and relive his experiences so that we might read and learn.NM"
2,Very difficult to focus,"I found them almost impossible to get focused and then after using for a short time, my eyes were crossed. I guess they were never focused and I was compensating. What do you want for eight bucks."
1,Barska Lucid 8x21 Compact Binocular,I was very disappointed with this purchase. The picture of this item does not match what I received. I had tickets to a play and wanted the fancy pair of binoculars I saw on the picture. It did not matter that the item said black because I just assumed they would not be red. I was shocked and disappointed to find out I was deceived.
2,Picture is completely wrong!,"The binoculars you receive look NOTHING like the picture. I didn't care if they were black and I know the description says they have protective rubber armor but if you buy these, expect to receive the ones they advertise for the Barska Lucid 12x25 Compact Binocular (Black). Performance wise they did ok but still to weak for what I was hoping for. I purchased them for a girlfriend that I took to a sporting event but she most likely will not use them again. When I tried them the athletes still looked far away, you might as well just look at the big screen monitors, there really was no difference. I will purchase a higher magnification next time for her."
4,excellent CHUMBAWAMBA love/hate album,"this first 6 songs are the folky numbers. the last 7 are a bit more on the rollicking side of things. Chumbawamba knows how to flawlessly perform both of these styles with class. they are geniuses and master songwriters. every cut on here is great...but my favoriters would have to be ""All Mixed Up"", ""Ugh! Your Ugly New Houses!"", and ""This Girl."" quality stuff from this cool band....oh, did i mention that they are funny, as well?"
5,LOVE THESE STONES!,"I'm not sure what happened with the other reviewers... I almost returned this after reading the reviews but figured since I already had the kit I would give it a shot. My daughter and I made two stones today, and it was super fun, easy, and they are awesome! The instructions say to use cold water... that warm or hot water will cause it to dry too fast. So after reading the reviews here, I decided the colder the better! So I put the cold water in the freezer for about 3-5 minutes before mixing. I had the designs laid out, followed the instructions to a tee, worked very quickly on the first one, and it still was another 20 minutes before it hardened. I took a little more time with the second and it was still perfectly fine. Super cute. I would make the same comment, though, that the butterfly stickers provided are too big to put under any of even the larger stones provided. We just used our own stickers and that worked fine."
3,Okay,"This book is so-so. If you're looking for fast review...this is for you. However, if you want to really understand it or are studying independently, buy Microeconomics the Easy way as well."
2,What one would expect of Princeton Review,"Oversimplified once again, and with some serious errors, especially on one question on comparative advantage where they've reversed the numerator and denominator of a fraction. My friends who were unfortunate enough to buy this as their review for AP Econ found themselves completely confused and having wasted so much time on mistakes in the book. The review wasn't particularly comprehensive or in-depth, there were blatant errors (mentioned in other reivews), and the tests again were easy compared to the AP exam...never a good thing for test prep books."
4,Delightfully fun book,A really entertaining book with some useful information for me since I have recently assumed the post of Music Director for the Living Room Philharmonic!
1,Boo hiss - C'mon Rena!!,"Oy, where do I start. Living in LA, and knowing all the struggling talent out here, I find it very hard to believe that a better script couldn't have been found! Showgirls 1 has a special place in many people's hearts. What a missed opportunity. This stinker doesn't even meet the ""so bad, it's good"" standard. Just an embarrassing mess for all involved. On no level does it meet the minimum standard for any production I've ever been involved with in 27 years. Including sound, make-up, choreography, direction, script, lighting, set staging/production value, wardrobe, and on and on. Why'd they even bother?!!?"
4,A Refreshing Change of Pace!,"I was referred to this CD through her publicist in the San Francisco bay area. Her vocal style reminds me of another inspirational folk singer I play on my radio station, Eliza Gilkyson. Cari gets her inspiration on this CD from the Toltec teachings of author, don Miguel Ruiz. The tracks, ""Beautiful Life"" and ""Teo"" were beautifully produced and are the highlights of this refreshing CD. I must say that she's one of the most promising voices I've heard in a long time. Buyers looking for an artist they can learn from as well as sit back and relax to will not be disappointed. By taking the time to listen to her CD, it will prove to be a journey to soothe the body's mind and spirit."
4,Very inspired - Eloquent,"Cari has captured some of our common experience in this recording. Beautiful words and harmonies. As I continue to listen, I continue to appreciate. Several speak to my soul with reminders like, ""I will respect my body"" and other affirmations which reinforce loving our Selves. Always gold to be found and appreciated in Cari's creativity."
1,Circle of Fire-sizzles out,"Not at all what I expected, very slow and droll, the written words are excellent. Cari's voice is great yet never has the depth to make any of the songs remarkable. Besides that listening to this CD could be considered cruel and unusual punishment."
3,"An interesting depiction of rural life, travel, and tragedy","This book of poetry is a pretty good depiction of rural life, travel and tragedy. Renay skillfully blends slang and common prose into an interesting melange of uneducated and learned. E.G., ""two bars two churches,/a Piggly Wiggly, they drive/pickup trucks my leathers/spook the waitress""The best poems in this collection are ""after all"" which is a eulogy for a fallen whore; ""academy award wife"" a searing tale of spousal abuse; and ""backwater economics"" is a portrait of a rural town with interesting imagery and diction.If you are into underground poetry get this book! But if you stick to Pound or Keats then simply choose elsewhere."
1,Unplayable,"We opened this violin past the return date (was a Christmas present for our daughter) and found that one string would not stay on or tightened. After 30 minutes of trying it out, another string broke. I am really disappointed and have no options because of the company's return policy (no returns for any reason after 30 days)."
2,Review,It's a good Violin for a kid but if you are an adult save your money and get something better. Don't be cheap~
1,the worst ever!,"Purchased a violin via Amazon from Austin Bazaar, what a rip off!Arrived with the bow broken, bridge is warped, tail piece is cheap plastic instead of wood, and it would not carry a true note if you gave it a bucket!Looking forward to my cc statement!"
1,I get what I pay for,"Quite junky. The nylon/plastic cord holding the tailpiece to the violin is fighting the string tension with only 2 brass nuts THREADED onto the cord. Who threads a soft plastic cord? Anyhow, the nuts kept slipping, as did the plastic pegs. Prepare for a fight when this thing gets unwrapped."
1,Horrible don't waste your money,"My daughter bought this with a gift card and was so excited, until it showed up. It was broken, strings undone, rosin was just dust. I tried to fix it and figured it just wasn't worth it. It is very cheaply made. You'd be better off buying a plastic pretend violin."
5,A very solid little creature for starting out with.,"This little violin is well priced and reasonably well made for anyone wanting to start out playing, it has all the right bits in the right places and is even available in funky colours if thats what students want just make heads turn and the learning continue (believe me, if a funky colour get's a childs peers giving postive feedback and showing interest then children will be keener to keep up the musical habit! A habit which is so often a trendy whim!)It's not a strad, but then what beginner needs a master players instrument? That would be like giving a baby a kettle drum instead of a rattle no?"
1,Disappointed!,"This is my first time writing a review. However I felt the need to help someone else. I was totally disappointed with this product. I had to constantly bring it to a specialist repair shop to try to keep the pegs in place. It was impossible, so it resulted in the violin being constantly out of tune. Very discouraging, and destroyed my enthusiasm to play!"
1,Better uses for wood and glue....,"Antonio Stradivari would have called this ""kindling"".Recommendation is to reconsider. Go with quality at the outset, no matter the level of the player."
1,You get what you pay for!,I've learned my lesson. What an embarrassment to have my husband open this Christmas morning and it was broken! The chin rest was cracked in half. I was very unsatisfied with the quality of this product. You can definitely tell that it is a very inexpensive product. It felt like a piece of cardboard with some cheap strings on it. You get what you pay for.
2,Violin,"My son's violin teacher took one look at this violin and told me to return it immediately. You'll do a lot better going to a local music store and spending a few more dollars. This is very cheaply made, and not up to standards. If you want your kid to learn violin, don't handicap him/her at the beginning. I wil say, though, that the company took the violin back without any argument. Thus my 2 stars."
1,disappointed,"I purchased the violin thinking it would be ready to use - we had to spend an additional $20 to get the violin set up to use, at which time the gentlemen told me that it looked like someone had already tried setting it up - dont know much about violins, but if it isnt ready to be used right away, the advertisement should state that. Rosie"
1,"Awful, Terrible, Total Piece of Junk","There was nothing redeemable about this toy violin. In essence, it is a toy. Nothing about it was substantial, it arrived partially damaged, and was impossible to fix. Awesome job guys."
2,Violin Review,"I have received the item very quickly, but I found that the 'Sound box' was broken.I have given that Violin to repair at a local store. I am paying three times more I saved by purchasing online."
1,Beware ! Looks NOTHING like photo !,"Beware ! Looks NOTHING like photo ! Was excited when we ordered it only to be let down when we opened the box to find a very thin wood,delicate, cheap made violin that was in a dusty case that is nothing like the stock photo ! I wanted to cry because my teenage son had saved his money to buy his girlfriend a birthday present and this is what he had chose. He had called everyday from his church vacation trip to see if it had arrived... I felt soooo bad for him.. It wasn't worth the trouble to return it, with shipping and restocking fees... Such a let down ... doesn't deserve the one star in my opinion !"
2,"very cheap price, very cheap violin","my wife bought this violin thinking it'd at least be good enought to learn on. however, the bridge is so crappy that it is almost impossible to play the 2 inner strings. most violins have a ""tent"" shape, allowing you to play each individual string seperately. this violin has flat and high action, making it extremely hard to play. save up your money and get a real violin if you're at all serious about playing."
4,Beginner's Violin.,This is a beautiful beginners violin. It's at a great price and if you're just starting up then this is will be a good fit for you.
3,Violin Review,"My sister bought this for my 18th birthday, because I really wanted to learn how to play the violin. I played the violin for 2 years when I was 9 and 10, so I havent played it in a long time. I play the piano, clarinet, and oboe, so I already have some music abilities. However to me it just isn't a good violin. I gave it to my 10 year old brother who is in orchestra and it works only ok for him. The biggest problem is the pegs slip so much and no music store around me sells anything from them. Plus a string has already popped twice. Also the bridge was not installed and I had to take it to a music store for them to put it on. Also the music store said the strings were really cheap and I would need to replace them all.Overall, I think it's good for a little kid and that's it. It is really cheap so I guess you get what you pay for."
2,You get what you pay for,"This was for my daughter in the 7th grade, you get what you pay for so if you are expecting something more than a very inexpensive violin, get something else. It's working fine for her now, but out of the box the strings broke as the music teacher set it up, then it would not hold tune so we had to purchase additional parts to keep the knobs tight to keep the instrument in tune. I read the same complaints from others, bad strings and tuning knobs (not sure what they are called, but the part that the strings wrap around that you tighten to tune the strings) so I expected it, but what do you want for the price. The case is also very flimsy, not much protection offered at all. And ok yea, as other stated, the rosin was a joke."
1,Terrible Quality of Workmanship,I bought this as a Christmas gift and it is just not acceptable to give as a gift.The varnish is high gloss and has drip marks on it. The black paint is badly applied and there is a streak of black paint on the unfinished part of the neck. The paint on the scroll at the bottom of the tuners very messy. There are also white spots where varnish is missing.I am returning the item despite the 20% restocking fee charged by the seller.
2,re: customer service,I bought this violin for my granddaughter and while the instrument itself was adequate the wrong violin was shipped and I found it extremely difficult to resolve the issue. It took many e-mails and several weeks before I had the correct size violin. Many of my e-mails were ignored and no one answered the phone once I tracked the number down. I was also mis-informed about the shipping date. I will not use this company again.
2,Violin theory of Relativity,"Violins are the most beutiful interesting instruments. They come in all shapes, sizes, colors, and price tags. This violin I bought when I first started out. It is the perfect violin to see how dedicated you are to the instrument, since it has a very cheap price tag. I recommend to all begginers this violin, but only for their first few months or year depending on their progress. The violin does have a major fault in that the action. Meaning the strings are to far off the fingerboard so it's hard to play in the higher positions. So I recommend sanding down the bridge until the strings are all 1/8 of an inch off the fingerboard at the end of the fingerboard. Other than that flaw the violin is perfect for young kids since it is a very durable violin and not to mention cheap, and always remember the violin doesn't make the music as much as the violinist makes the violin make music."
3,"Like it, but disappointed.","This product does not include a beard as indicated in the description. The pants are short and do not have fur at the bottom. There is a little fur at the top of the boot covers, but the pants are too short to keep tucked into the boots. I do like the outfit, though, and will make the effort to add fur to the pants."
4,great quality for a costume,my 8 year son loved this costume. We live in a snowy climate and it was perfect and easy to see in the dark.
2,Disappointed xmas present,A couple of flaws on the suit. The trim in some areas were stained pink instead of being white. The button on the back to fasten around the neck fell off as soon as I touched it. The Santa hat was way to small. This suit is not worth the money.
1,BAH Humbug!!!,"This waffle maker is worse than terrible! I bought it as a Christmas gift based on the quality and reliability of the Cuisinart name. I have several great Cuisinart products but this is a bomb. Even the coolest heat setting was too high. The waffles burned on the bottom and were raw on top. Also the suggested amount of batter was way too much and glopped out all over. Messy and more messy. I would have given it zero stars if possible. These ""waffles"" might be good for target practice and hopefully Cuisinart doesn't manufacture shotguns. PULL!!!"
2,"Inferior sound, buyer beware !!!","I bought this boot CD a few years ago from what turned out to be a notorious Oklahoma City bootleg peddler on EBay. The music is great, but the CD(R) is inferior. There is no official ""label"" mentioned per se, no bar code, and it is cheaply made with a thin card for an insert. You can hear the crackling of the analog vinyl it was lifted off. There has never been officially sanctioned releases of either of Chris Youlden's first 2 efforts on CD. Hopefully the original label, Deram, will come out with a legit release someday under Mr. Youlden's oversight. Until then, unfortunately, these Euro bootlegs are all you have to choose from, other than hunting down the original vinyl. If you are an audio remaster fanatic, then buyer beware !!"
4,Bootleg or not ...,... I was surprised how clean the issue I got sounds. I was expecting much less because of what I had been reading.
1,Not a standard wallet,This isn't a wallet. It's a card case with a money clip in the center when you open it up. No place for receipts. Maybe someone else will appreciate the money clip gizmo. I found it clumsy and insecure.
3,Inconsistent manufacturing process,"I purchased this product about a year ago and was very happy with it then I purchased another one but the second product came with the metal springs protruding outside the leather fold so I was not happy with it. If your going to make something, make it ALWAYS THE SAME."
2,disappointing and truly bizarre,"I am one for truly bizarre stories, so when I read the reviews for this book I just had to order it. However, upon reading it I was more disappointed than delighted. I felt like the author was trying too hard to be deep and profound. Often times the story would abruptly end and I would be left wondering if there was symbolic or poetic value in it ending where it did, or whether the author just got tired of writing and so ended the story. However, unwilling to leave this book without having given it every chance to redeem itself (or rather, the author, not the book) I read until the very end. I suppose I found in the last story ""Parker Swells"" some remnants of a decent story and so the book is the better for this story. However, I would not recommend this book to anyone and hope that those who do choose to read it are not as disappointed as I was."
5,GREAT TV GOOD PRICE,"When I find a good deal I stick with that brand or company. This will be the third Daewoo set I have bought here at Amazon, and all three are better than a lot of comparable sets selling for more in the bog box stores."
2,Not a bad TV,"This TV seemed okay, however it shipped to me with a broken and squashed remote, which would be unusual."
5,Zowie!,I don't know why this band is not better known. A friend introduced me to it several years ago (2006). Almost reluctantly I agreed to give it a listen (we all have friends that think we need to hear this or that great band). I don't think they know how to make a bad song - and I'm fairly critical about what I like and don't like. How I hope they stay together and continue to make great music.
2,What up with uncle l???,"In the words of Chris Tucker in Money Talks 'Man,where yo shirt at?' I hate to say this about a legend but man this whole joint was wack! I need G.O.A.T. to realize that he is a hip hop god and he doesn't need to sound or act like anybody but UNCLE L, The Future of the Funk!!! Bring back Jack the Ripper!!!"
5,LL is da DEFinition,"This album has to be da best album of the summer. When I heard ""Headsprung"", I knew this album was goin' to be crazy. He has evolved. U will listen to this CD non-stop w/ no skipping tracks. Da best song of tha whole album is ""Feel The Beat"". LL and Will are the top rappers in da 21st Century."
3,This has a dance feel,"This is not really mainstream but some of the beats are suspects some of these songs are pretty smooth rap songs on this album it is a half and half album it is pretty cool sometimes.The Top songs are ""Headstrong"",""Rub my Back"",""Hush"",""Shake it baby"" and ""Can't Explain it""Lyrics-7/10 Production-6/10 X Factor-6/10 Classic-7/10 Replay-7Total=6.5 out of 10 Fingers"
2,run of the Mill LL,"I mainly got this for His Duet with R.kelly""I'm gonna get Her"" which works&I dig ""feel the Beat"". the tracks with Timberland are aight but Timberland to Me played out like 3 years back.LL Been on Cruise Control for well over a Decade now.He still has moments every now&then but it's pretty safe to say He is just going through the Motions.still you always keep an eye on Him just in case."
1,LL WHAT HAPPEN?,"GO BACK TO BEING THE LL YOU USE TO BE RUFF RUGGED AND RAW,LAST ALBUM I GOT FORM THIS CAT WAS THE GOAT AND IT WAS ALRIGHT...OTHER THAN THAT THE DEFINITION IS NOT SOMETHING I WOULD WONT TO PLAY."
5,LL does it again,I personally think this is a great edition to everyones LL's collection and for anyone just finding there way into hip hop it has everything from funky sing along tunes such as hush (track 5) to spine tingaling B lines such as headstrong (track 1). I have 2 say Ive been known to buy an album for 1 track and I think LLs' THE DEFinition is 1 to buy for the track HUSH (track 5) alone!! You can preview it at any good music store. God bless!!
1,Pretty Bad but still ok at times,"Couple ok songs, Headsprung, Hush were nice releases, few others were good but this seemed more of a club album"
2,L?,What happenned I like LL but not this one maybe 2 hits and one is not that Garbage Headsprung....why would you try to go club thats not what you are known 4 so why try Dont waste youre money like I did If I would have been smart I would have just downloaded this!
2,"Not good, but not that bad either","Ok, ""Headsprung"" is no doubt a good song. Although the lyrics are really silly and don't make a lot of sense at times, but it's still a good song. ""Hush"" is a song that I expect a lot of people not to like. I was kind of suprised to hear it. I think it's really good, but people who are hardcore Hip-Hop fans probably will think it's too soft. LL has always been known to put love songs out there. As evident by his ""I need love"" song about 15 or 17 years ago. He was heavily criticized until he came back with ""Mama said knock you out"". Anyway, this CD is overall decent. With a two standouts in my opinion, but it lacks the whole package."
3,It's iight,The CD wasnt LL's best work. I mean first of all it didnt have a lot of track. secondly lyrically it was a bad album. The beats were hot and just put this in a party and thats it. if u ll fan go get it but if you are lookin for a great album don get it.
3,Decent album,"This album has some nice beats, however its the same old L.L..... he needs to release a creative and deep album that could blast him right back into the hip-hop scene... he needs to quit using album fillers and create an album that will turn some heads..... there are a few good songs on this album, but nothing really spectacular, he needs a huge hit to re-launch his career, even though he is getting old now"
1,Wack,"Ever since Canibus ripped a hole in LL's weak no-talent-having-elementary-school raps, LL has been softer than a twinkie. The only people listening to this trash are worthless morons. Peace to the Gods!!!!!!!"
1,Just Another Horrible Comeback,"Like the title says, just plain awful from start to finish. The only good cd L.L. Cool J created was ""Bigger and Deffer"". He certainly isn't a G.O.A.T. nor do any Ladies Love Cool James."
2,am I the only one that notices...,"that headsprung sounds VERY similar to ""vivrant thing"" by Q-tip? beat and deliveryLL isnt bad he must be doing something right to be in the game for 20 years...1 star for each decade of being the gameCanibus owned him"
3,GOOD ALBUM,"LLCOOLJ does it again i have read other people reveiws on here and they don't know what there are talking about. The beats on this Album is HOT! Timbaland is the most underated producer. He made LL sound good. on the title track Headsprung featuring Timbaland fromI'm Gonna Get Her featuring R. Kelly these track are the best. LLCOOL is the only real rapper out there that everybody can listen to. Wil Smith don't count he completly SUCKS!! all in all i recommend this Album, you want be disappointed it is way better than Jay Z and that garbage new CD from 50 Cents."
1,Wires are not heavy enough - blows fuses,"After five uses the recommended 15 amp fuse protecting the accessory I installed with this harness failed due to overheating. The wires on this harness are too small. I removed the worthless harness and directly wired heavier guage wire to the relay pins with solderless connectors. Accessory is still working after a week. Don't buy this product, it's definately not heavy duty for anything over 10 amps and may cause damage worse than a blown fuse."
1,Not a good design.... please read.....,"Military Electronics Technician, here's the deal, wire are too small diameter to carry current, you will lose power, not a good match up for the #12 gage wire I am using for Fiamm horns.After waiting the full ship estimate time to get this item, (the Amazon photo seems to show larger size wires than came on this item), I pitched for my own safety (could cause over heating of wires).INSTEAD I will use crimp connectors 10-12 gage, female, with fully insulated covers. A dab of black silicone RTV will keep them in place. Oh, yes, the connector hardly squeezes onto the FIAMM RELAY, takes a channel lock pliers to push them together. Not a perfect world for this connector. :("
1,All Wires are short 18Ga wires. Socket is not as advertised.,"These sockets arrived with 5 short 18ga wires. (labeled on the wires) Not the ""Three 12"" heavy 14 ga. power wires and two 12"" 18 ga. wires"" as advertised. I was planning on using these sockets to connect (+/- 45 Amp) compressors via high Amp relays. I'm glad I looked closely at the tiny gauge wires wrapped in deceptively thick insulation. Otherwise these sockets would have caused a fire."
1,Not recommended....,"This relay and plug is not worth your time...The description (Three 12"" heavy 14 ga. power wires and two 12"" 18 ga. coil control wires.) is not accurate at all. The wires are 6"" at best and the wires are no where near 14 gauge. They appear to be all the same size (18 Gauge) with the main feed wires having thicker insulation to appear that they are larger gauge wires. I would be hesitant to run more than 15 amps through this relay. I am ASE certified in automotive electronics and I will not be using this for my vehicle."
5,Good quality and design,"Good quality and gauge of wire. I linked two of these for a key-less entry system and was able to release the clips and remove the female spades, this made it possible to cut off excess wire and solder closer to the spade for a very clean install."
4,For a professional look,"Relay sockets complete the install, they make it look proper. My only complaint is the sockets are VERY tight when new, but otherwise work fine."
1,Relay Disappointment,"Received this relay and was expecting three 14AWG wires and two 18AWG wires. However, on this relay all five wires are the small 18AWG. They are even labeled 18AWG. These wire are just too small for a 30amp relay. Very disappointed!"
2,18 gauge wires,"I bought this socket instead of other less expensive ones here on Amazon because it was listed as having three 14 gauge wires (still too small for a 30 Amp circuit) and two 18 gauge wires (suitable for the control). Instead, all 5 wires are 18 gauge. I disassembled the sockets and rewired with proper wiring. I expect you will need to do this on any of the sockets purchased here as they all come from China where stated specifications are usually inaccurate or purposely false. So just buy the cheapest sockets you can find and plan to rewire them."
5,Baywatch Season 1,"I Used to watch Baywatch all the time on TV. I really enjoyed it. So, I Have been trying to get as many seasons as possible."
4,Towing Mirror,"It's one of the better mirrors we've used. Once adjusted it's pretty rock solid. The first time we used it, we hit some good side winds and it never moved!"
5,CIPA door mount Towing Mirror,While this style of mirror is considerably more expensive that the ones that clip/strap onto your existing mirror it is well worth the extra cost. Installing and removing the mirror is simple and straight forward. The clamp and strap mounting (between the window slot and the door bottom) makes the mirror very stable when driving.The only negative that I have is that the ball joint that permits you to tilt the mirror up and down seems to be too tight and makes you feel that it may break when you attempt to adjust the tilt.
4,Easy install with good viewing,"These mirrors install quickly, and have many points of adjustment.I have a jeep JK which has almost perfectly flat doors.I was still able to get the mirrors tight.My only gripe is that the strap that runs down to the bottom edge of the door has a tendancy to vibrate in the wind. I wonder if it does it less on a typical curved door profile. I was able to change the speed at which the resonance occured by increasing or reducing strap tension.Overall I pleased with these. They extend out far eough to really open up the view behind my camper."
3,Not for Ford Expedition,Bought for 2005 Ford Expedition which has a lower door molding that prevents the bottum clip from attaching securely. Otherwise the mirrors look like they would work.
4,On my 2000 Tundra they work well,"Started towing a travel trailer and required mirrors that could see past the trailer. These have worked well for 4 years and roughly 10,000 miles.The first time attaching them the angled portion that fits over the weather strip of the window would either catch or scrap against the window as it was raised. I bent each ""tab"" a little more and they work fine. After the first mirror adjustment they stay in place even after opening and closing the doors many times. After a day of rain one moved while raising the window, the web strap will stretch a little when wet."
1,Noise drove me nuts,"This thing makes both low and high pitch LOUD noise that just drove me nuts. Yes, it was properly secured. No, I was not going 90 miles per hour. Yes, I was around 60 - 65 mph on highway. Yes, safety is important.I know what some of you guys will say. ""Son, suck it up and live with it for safety"". NO way. Did we suck it up and endured the British back in the days. No sir, not the American way. I rather take ten crying babies and ten dogs and cats fighting in the back seat over this thing. I am returning this and looking into rear view cameras that I can mount on side of my trailers."
4,doesn't fit 1999 Toyota 4Runner Limited,"The molding on the bottom of the door is too thick for the hook to attached to the metal frame and I can't get enough tension with it attached to the molding. Plus, I would be leery to put too much torque on the molding. I am going to try to find a way to customize it to attached to the metal door frame or inside the door somehow. Other than that I think it would work fine on vehicles that don't have a stylized molding at the bottom of the door."
4,Works well,Mirrors were well packed and no problems. They mounted on my Chev. Equinox with no problems. When instructions were followed everything went together well. Mirrors had minimal vIbration when traveling. They seemed to be well engineered and well built. Happy with purchase.
2,Switched Dogs in the Middle,"The first half of the book is devoted to material about CKCS, the remainder on training, habits shows other dogs. It is a little disconcerting when you buy a book about a specific dog, and end up reading about the training of other canines."
5,I'M SMARTER NOW.....,"I ENJOYED THIS BOOK VERY MUCH. I DO KNOW A GREAT DEAL ABOUT THIS BREED AND FOUND IT ONE I COULD RECOMMEND TO NEW PUPPY OWNERS AS REQUIRED READING. THE AUTHOR WAS INFORMATIVE AND INTERESTING. THE DOGS ILLUSTRATED WERE LOVELY. I AM IN LOVE WITH THE DOG ON THE COVER.....HE IS A REAL ""KEEPER.""I WAS IMPRESSED WITH THE DISCUSSION ON A RAW DIET AND MANY OTHER TOPICS NOT USUALLY COVERED IN AN INTRODUCTORY BOOK."
2,Not what I was looking for,"This started out good, but then strayed from the king charles. I did get some good info. I liked the pictures."
2,Good for Those Thinking of Purchasing a Cav,"I found a lot of interesting information in this book, but it seemed to be more about dogs in general than the specific breed. In fact, the second half of the book has pictures of other breeds. Overall, I think this book is a nice introduction to the breed but not very informative for those who already are well acquainted with the breed."
4,Rig Veda - Great CD,"The Rig Veda has been sung for thousands of years to praise the gods. Yesudas continues this oral tradition on this recording set to music by Rangasami Parthasarathy. One of India's best classical singers, Yesudas has also collaborated with Parthasarathy on the Bhagavad Gita.This CD comes with lyrics in Sanskrit, an English transliteration and an English translation. I found this booklet very helpful. They will help someone new to the Rig Veda to still appreciate the music and the meaning."
5,Divorce Without Disaster is very common sense advice!,Divorce Without Disaster: Collaborative Law in TexasJanet P. Brumley and Lori Fairchild do a great service to divorcing couples. The book is full of reasonable ways of thinking about yourself and your child's other parent. It gives common sense ways a team of people can support you through a difficult transition. It is a valuable read!
4,A good book for all in the age group of 8-13,"I read this novel when I was 10, it was a part of my growing up years in the nicest possible way. And though I don't have a copy now, the fond memories linger on. I recommend this one to all who love nice, clean and 'close to life' books."
5,Another great All-of-A-Kind Family book!,"By the way Amazon, this book is not for babies and toddlers as it says in the subject thing below. It is for elementary kids.This book was during the start of World War 2. It also covered the Epedemic (or was that the other book? Oh, well) and this would probably have to be my favorite out of all the books."
1,Ships in Depends Box for all to see. Embarrassing.,I purchased this from Amazon for my mother in law. It came in the Depends box and was left outside her apartment door for all to see. She was very embarrassed.
1,Depend? Depend on what? How big your ass is?,it is small (and or medium). It doesn't fit my ass. Its too small.
2,not what i expect,"this book is alittle out dated.and doesn't show pictures, and it was difficult to find some of the supplies.this book is good if you live with your horses becaue it gives like ""meals"" you can make and serve to your horse."
3,Not for the modern treat maker,"the book is nice how it offeres a variety of treats to treat your horse to....but i don't get why they have ""hors d'oeuvres, salads, snacks, and desserts"" ? i'd thought this was just being silly by all of this. but maybe for this day and age, it is silly. i just want a book filled of treats i can stick in my pockets and give as christmas gifts....not fancy bran mashes and salads to make for my horse.so for the snack section and the desserts section i give it 5 stars, for including the other things overall it gets 3.and i also wish that there was pictures of the creations to atleast some of the recipes. instead of all just random pictures of cute horses.so we need a newer horse treat book!!! not that oldies arn't just as good. i suggest going online as opposed to this book."
1,A terrible book,"I had this book in an undergradute class in electronics and it did not teach me anything. It explains the physics of the devices, but that part of the chapter is not interesting enough to read. The example problems are plug and chug problems, which provide you with almost all of the necessary numbers and the reader only has to follow the given equations. This would make the student think that all problems can be done using the exact equations given except for the fact that multiple equations are given for similar situations with no explanation of the differences. Finally, the end of chapter problems are much harder than the example problems and cannot be done by simply following the equations."
2,Never really helped me much,"I almost never used the book for much more than a formula here or there, reading through it didn't help me understand the concepts of a basic circuit design class I bought it for. I mostly had to rely on other sources of information to do well in the class. The authors are professors at my university, and are notoriously bad at bringing the material to a first-time learner's level. The book has also never been revised, from my understanding."
1,"Terrible textbook, waste of money","This book is absolutely unintelligible in the places that can be the most confusing. It is not structured in the slightest, the equations are inconsistent, and the actual problems require you to use techniques not shown in the book at all. Random assumptions are pulled out of thin air and the diagrams have subscripts that aren't referenced anywhere else in the chapter.I have no idea why the professor uses this. His lectures are painfully trivial, and the book is incomprehensible, which makes for a very painful experience."
1,More difficult than it should be,"This book is far more confusing than it needs to be. It was clearly written for experts in circuit design and not for students. Frequently, the book will skip several steps under the assumption that you understand the reasoning and steps in between. However, if it's your first time learning about transistors, you end up more confused when the chapter is finished. Problems in the back are also equally frustrating, and often times appear to be compleatly contradictory to what is ""explained"" in the chapter.Do yourself a favor, if you are taking a class that requires this book, take it from someone else. This book is evil."
1,Student,"Avoid spending money on buying this book if possible. It is a very poor product. It is incomplete, too brief or simply skips too many steps in worked problems. It also does not seem to emphasize design as the title would suggest. I wish the professor never chose this book."
3,Really not that bad...,"but then again, Dr. Comer was also teaching the class. I can imagine it's not as effective when the author isn't there to explain it, and the book isn't without it's errors, but it is still better than some of the circuits books I've used prior."
5,The most realistic and enjoyable I've read in almost 20 years,"I have read, or tried to read, dozens and dozens of books about all aspects of Paganism and this was by far the easiest to relate to. It was as if I were sitting in my living room discussing these things with the author over a cup of coffee. I'm not saying that everything in it is 'gospel' (a point she makes early on in the book) but you would be hard-pressed to find a book better written. I liken her to the Hemingway of Pagans ... she's able to say a lot without having to use the volume of words so many others feel necessary. (It's almost as if so many other Pagan authors are just filling up pages to hear themselves speak.)This is the book I gave my husband to help him understand what I believe and why. I have also shared it with friends who were interested. I cannot recommend it highly enough."
3,Daisy Soundtrack by Shigeru Umebayashi,"Although the title of this item seems confuse, this is the soundtrack of the film Daisy by composer Shigeru Umebayashi (In the mood for love, House of flying daggers, Spirit). Nice and melodic soundtrack with beautiful moments of piano."
5,"very purple, very blocklike","This purple block is more purple and more blocklike than most.It's bigger than a three inch purple block, but not so large as a five inch one. If what you are looking for is a four inch purple block, you can't go wrong."
4,Fun in the Sun !,"Brannan Lane has created a wonderful, relaxing, CD. Amazing memories of the Barbados flood my mind whenever this CD is spinning. Sitting back, closing my eyes - I can picture the white sandy beach with the swaying palm trees - remembering all the ""fun in the sun"".This CD is professionally done and captures your imagination of the Islands. It will bring back Caribbean memories and touch your soul if you have been to the islands - or it will create visions for you, if you haven't. But all in all - this CD gives you the Island feeling all around - and watch your feet - you will feel it tapping :)Heather Baskey, Mississauga, Ontario - Canada"
5,Awesome,My son loves this series. He listens to them in the car and in his room. We buy all of his works.
5,This is an important book for physicians and researchers as well as nurses.,It changed my view of how insight into patients' health care issues occurs and what provides the foundation for that insight.
5,Under Appreciated Album A Must Buy,"This album represents to me the best of the minimalist underground sound making a comeback nowadays. Riddled with beautiful melodies and evoctaive lyrics, like reflections of summer time as a child, this is a must buy and one of the stronger releases to come out in a while. Why it is so unknown and underappreciated is completely beyond me."
3,Good info on my cousin's father's maternal line.,"Seems well researched. Certainly worth the price. As with most genealogies of it's era it would benefit for more information of its sources. So, it is like the Visitations, it gives you a starting point for more research."
4,COOL,"This is the 2nd pouch that I have ordered. It is the right size to fit in your purse and keeps the insulin pen cool. I purchased another brand (poucho) and was very disapointed...the cooling pouch only lasted for several months. The previous Frio pouch I had lasted over a year....the one drawback to these pouches is that when you need a new one you have to purchase the whole package, when the outer cover is still in good shape. This product should be offered as a package or as individual items."
3,Frio Cooling Wallet,"I bought the Individual size cooling wallet and used it when I traveled from Chicago to Spain.I think the wallet kept my insulin cool for 20 hours although the insulin did not feel cold when I took it out of the case and refrigerated it.My insulin work well when I used it, so the Frio wallet worked to keep my insulin fresh."
2,Doesn't work for my particular need,"This may be great for insulin storage, but I needed to store a probiotic capsule overnight so that I can swallow it and then go back to bed for an hour. For some reason, this damp storage just doesn't work - even when the capsule is in a plastic container."
3,ok,I have owned a few frio's over the past ten years. All did the job they were designed to do but the one or two I have purchased in recent time Just make the quality grade. Know one makes things like they use to.
4,Just wow.,"I bought this for my insulin pen based solely on previous reviews, and wow. Everyone was right. What a really great way to keep your insulin properly cooled. It's so simple to use and so lightweight. Just the right size too, for my pre filled insulin pen. The only knock on it is that I need another container to hold my needles and alcohol swabs. So I got something else to carry those as well as my portable sharps container and glucose meter. However the FRIO is so convenient, I'm glad I found and bought it."
5,Great product,"I purchased a larger pouch 5 years ago, prior to a trip to the Grand Canyon. It is still performing flawlessly. I wanted the single pouch so I would always have my Novolog pen with me. The bonus is that, in a pinch, I can also slip my Byetta in next to it. It's snug - but on a hot summer day, when I need to be gone from the house all day, the pouch keeps both pens cool - and not cold."
3,Not cold long enough,"The unit is as advertised, I was disappointed at the length of time my insulin pen stayed cold. I have stopped using it on long trips."
5,Holds attention of babies,"We started reading this book at 5 months. By 8 mos my son would point to familiar objects like the bathtub ducky. It is long enough to have substance, but short enough to hold the attention of the youngest reader. Minimal words, mostly drawn pictures. My son is a year now and still likes it; this one also features beginner words like DOG and BATH."
1,Stupid Book,"I am shocked to read the other reviews. As another reviewer stated, there is only one word per page and they don't rhyme or even make sense. This book was a HUGE disappointment. I have literally hundreds of childrens books and this one is going to the Goodwill. The words are like, Ball... Oops. Why is the ball an oops? How did it go through the window? This book is just lacking in everything. Don't waste your money."
5,Eleven Month Old's Textbook,"My eleven month old daughter studies this book with alarming intensity! This is always one of the first ones she picks out to read. And it's one that I can read to both her and my 3.5 year old, and that he can read to her."
5,My grandson loved the book. He loves all books by David Shannon.,"As a teacher of kindergarten children; I have been reading David Shannon's books for a few years. Out of all the books I read to them , their favorite is NO David, by David Shannon. My boys especially love the page where David runs down the street in his ""birthday suit"".My grandson really liked Oops!"
5,David Shannon is my grandchildren's favorite author!,David Shannon is great at portraying the irritations children bring to a parent in a very loving and fun way. My daughter discovered this author and shared him with me--all his books are truly wonderful.
1,horrible,This book is a big waste of money. Each page has only 1 word on it. My daughter was not interested at all. There is no story.
4,Very good info in this book,Bought this book as an additional source of info prior to doing my PADI Ice Diving Course. I've found instructors teach what they know which isn't always what is safest so I wanted to make sure when I made decisions they were informed ones. This book helped me ask some questions regarding my own safety I would never have thought about had I not read it. Anyone considering taking an Ice Diving course should buy this book and read it prior to taking the course. Remember singnals are different depending who your instructor is but as long as everyone is using the same ones it's OK. This book is definately worth the money.
3,Ok but there's better out there.,"Was excited to order this DVD but was diasappointed when it played. It has plenty of highlights and wrecks but well over half the time you don't even know who you're watching. I wish they would have taken a little time just to put the riders name at the bottom of screen and give the riders their dues. Also, there is no dialogue just an annoying, cheesy rock track that plays way too long. If you buy this video hit mute and at least listen to some decent music while you watch. Ok DVD but there are better ones like ""Toughest Sport on Earth"" that give great action combined with some really good rider insight."
5,great movie for a boy,i bought this for my son. HE LOVES IT! he can see it 100 times a day. it came in on time and in great conditions!
5,awesome,"This is the best tool for Bible studies, sermon prep, or word phrase lookups as well as original language study comparison. I can't wait until there is a training seminar in my area to learn how to use it to the fullest. A pastor friend of mine said the seminar shows how to make it even more powerful. A great time saver that has freed up more of my time for ministry. It is like having your personal library with multiple librarians looking up multiple books at one time, only with a click of a mouse. I will eventually upgrade to the best package with all books. The possibilities are endless. Pastor Barry"
5,clean,"the book is very good. lots of photographs of the art, however my professor and this book had some conflicting information on some minor stuff. overall very good."
2,The Old-Soldier of Art History Texts never dies (unfortunately). . . .,"Gardners' has long been regarded as the rather stuffy ""bible"" of art history texts, mainly because of its commercial longevity (it's been around since the 1930s). Recent editions have suffered under recent editorship. The addition of tiresome ""clever"" subtitles, coupled with the creeping-in of a new shallower ""touchy-feelie"" approach to the exegesis of the artworks--no doubt intended to perk-up this withering old warhorse--are sad things to behold. Readers are well-advised to select instead the far superior ART HISTORY by MARILYN STOKSTAD. It is everything Gardners' used to be...and more."
2,Picture book,The descriptions of the artwork is not the best. It's kind of a dry read. the pictures are printed well but could be better.
3,Its great for some stuff!,"I bought this text for my art history class, and I must say that the parts of the book about European art are great, but it fails with regards to its treatment of Asian, African and Native American Art. If I were a member of any of the above-mentioned groups, I would be greatly offended, because it just flies through those chapters, with a very Western way of looking at things...sad! The other sections are amazing, but this way of looking non-european art is common and I should be used to it by now! Since my course is based around this text, I must say that I am disappointed by my course too!"
2,Ambiguous Description,The book was shipped promptly but the seller was very ambiguous in some aspects of the order. They never stated whether the CD was included or not. I'm not saying that I expected the CD to be included but it would've been convenient if the seller was clear about it.
4,Great book for AutoCad users!,I was using Solidworks for most of my college projects and things just can't get easier! The book will frequently do a comparison between AutoCad and Solidworks to illustrate the different concepts behind the two CAD programs. Recommended for new users to experienced AutoCAD users.
2,HARD TO ASSEMBLE,This product sounded like a good idea - was hard to assemble and stabilize - also I do not think the thermostat worked - EVERYDAY the water was frozen solid - took down and used another product. Wish I could return it - for what I paid for it - was NOT up to my expectations. Did call the company twice - with no solution.
5,heated bird bath,This is a good product. We have been using it for a month in this cold weather and the birds are loving it.
4,A good purchase.,API 600 20-Inch Diameter Heated Bird Bath Bowl (no stand)This bird bath was easy to install on our deck railing close to an outlet so it could be plugged in for the winter. It is nice to watch the birds during the cold months being able to drink when everything else is frozen.
3,"Great Product, BUT....","This is the best bird bath for Michigan winters. It keeps the water temperature above freezing and the birds, squirrels and deer love it.The reason I gave it 3 stars is that I just purchased my third one. They last two lasted 3 years (just the length of the warranty period) and then the thermostat broke. The body looks still brand new and I still can use it as a unheated bird bath but there is no way to repair it. I use the bath only from November to April and store it the rest of the year inside the house and I expect to get a much longer life out of the product. I also called the Manufacturer but they were not responsive at all."
3,Pretty good study,"This book gives some interesting insights into the important Homeric characters and situations. It is a worthwhile read for anyone into Homeric studies. However, I found it rather wordy and at times with a tendency to vagueness. I enjoyed more Kirk's ""Homer and the Epic"", and Schein's ""The Mortal Hero""."
4,a helpful addition to Homer commentaries,The first thing the reader will notice is that this book is much more accessible than more overtly scholarly texts -- this is a good thing for either first time readers or long time fans of Homer's works. The opening chapters set the scene well and explain her methodology of picking special moments that illuminate the work as a whole. I enjoyed the first half of the book tremendously and found many fresh insights and interesting observations about both the Iliad and the Odyssey. My only slight disappointment was with the last 50-100 pages which focus mostly on plot summary of the Odyssey rather than her interesting commentary although she points out things along the way the readers should note. The last section reads more like Cliff's Notes while the first two-thirds of the book genuinely added to the reader's delight in Homer's works. Overall an excellent book.
4,"Homer without the ""angst""","Ms. Brann is a much-beloved Tutor at St. John's College, long a bastion of focus on the ""Great Books"". She has an amazing ability to reach behind the ""scholarly"" interpretation of Homer to the essentials that rare relevant for all of us. While the book focuses primarily on the Odyssey and the illuminative ""moments"" in the text, the Illiad is also well represented.You will not have to re-read the Illiad and the Odyssey to take great pleasure from Ms. Brann's book, though you will probably want to. She isolates specific areas of the texts as illustrative of the great insights of Homer and demonstrates how these incidences showcase some of the basic thoughts that ultimately resonate through Western literature.The text is crisp, flows well and ""Homeric Moments"" makes for interesting, challenging and very enjoyable reading."
3,no better than the stuff you pay $5 to $10 for at wal-mart,dont waste your time buying this expensive stuff. Just go to wal-mart and get the cheap brand it does the same thing.
1,I waited seven years for this?,This would have been album of the year if it had been released in 1986. There is nothing forward-thinking about this cd which is all that we had come to expect from Prodigy. I won't wait another seven years for the next album.
2,Seven-Year Itch,"In a dog's lifespan, seven years is roughly equivalent to the stretch from birth to mid-life crisis. Lordy! The Prodigy have been away quite a while, haven't they? You wouldn't guess it from ""Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned"", though - save for the fact that electro wasn't fashionable back then, this could've been recorded the day after they finished work on 1997's ""Fat of the Land"". Keith and Maxim are conspicuously absent, but the whole thing's still painfully familiar - that same faux-gritty ambience, all raw vocals, breakbeats anchored to detonator bass drum hits and super-distorted synths. Competent, yes, but is there really any need for this stuff any more? It all feels a bit same-old, and the choice to use guest vocalists on most every track serves only to make things feel more anonymous - less cohesive album, more remix project. A bit disappointing."
3,"good, bad, good","What I like about prodigy is Liam Howlett's ability to mix up several genres and come out with some big crazy sound. This album sports a lot of random fx, off-tempo arrangements, break-beat, big-beat, hip-hop, industrial, punk. But as always, that seems to create an imbalance in the overall effect of the whole album. The first few songs are great, Hotride is awesome, then it takes a downfall until you get to The Way it is. Most songs in the middle of the cd are tolerable, except for Action Radar, which makes me want to wrack my brains out. 7 out of 13 songs, but still worth the buy. P.S. Despite what some reviewers say about ""Shoot Down"" my only guess is that they don't like the vocals of Liam Gallagher from Oasis. Otherwise the song is bangin'. Other recommendations: JunkieXL, and Lunatic Calm"
1,B-SIDE album,"The Prodigy was my favourite electo band all those years. I can't belive that after 7 years of NOTHING they release a record where all tracks sounds pretty bad. It's sounds like a B-SIDE compilation. WAKE UP is the only track that sounds very close to real THE PRODIGY. I hope the next album is going to be much much better, and Liam will star to record a real HARD ELECTRO music, not DISCO 80's with a terrible female vocal. We need THE PRODIGY, man. We're in 2004, not in 1984. Don't buy this record. Buy a new single GIRLS. There is a great remix, that is called MORE GIRLS. This track is pretty amazing."
1,Not the worst cd I've heard,"Not the worst but pretty damn close. This is VERY different from Experience, Jilted, or Fat of the Land. I've been a fan ever since Jilted Generation was released and I have to say that Always Outnumbered just doesn't do it for me."
2,SO much potential.....,"I used to be obsessed with the prodigy, had every album and single released, but this cd has killed them. They have lost their originality and unique sound. Aside from ""girls"" and ""shootdown"" it is a very average cd. I really WANTED to like the cd after waiting so long for it, but its nothing compared to their old stuff."
2,Their worst by far,"For any fans thinking of buying this album, a strong word of caution: It is not Fat of the Land Part 2, and it doesn't really take the band to the next level, as the previous two albums had done. There's no progression here, if anything there is backsliding a little bit back into Jilted Generation's territory - except that the band's been there and done that already. This is an album where the band are treading water, with bland beats, female vocals that don't really fit into the Prodigy ethos, and completely forgettable tracks. Only Spitfire really has the Prodigy mark of quality on it. The rest is so indistinguishable from any middling electronica group out there.Also, Maxim and Keith might not originally have been vocalists, but the band evolved and garnered more success with them on vocals. They are sorely missed here, and leaving them off was a mistake. At best, this probably should have been released as a Liam side project than carrying the Prodigy name."
4,More old school hip hop than old school techno,"Basically, this is Liam's reinvention of Prodigy, a band whose roots started in old school techno (back when it was just called techno) and ventured into the big beat craze of the 90's. There's still a lot of those big beats here, but now he's bringing a lot of old school hip hop flair along with them. Surprisingly, the female vocals are provided by Juliette Lewis and they are not bad. There are a few good tracks here, but not as solid an outing as the albums that precede and follow it."
4,Industrial pop,"I'm a big Prodigy fan. This album is pushing for a niche in a fairly new hard-core pop genre which is only shared by a handful of artists. A bit indulgent and repetitious, but has great hooks and is so deliberate it almost threatens you to start dancing. The vocals are great one-liners which have become the norm for techno.....for the masses. I think it's good stuff, but lacks the layering and subtlety of previous albums. I think they're scared of sharing a stage with anyone soft like Moby, so they're pushing like hell away from that. But the music's very intelligent and original. After six songs in however, your ears may need a break. Great for shuffling."
1,PURE GARBAGE!,"Prodigy split up long time ago, the new cd was made by one member and went under the name Prodigy so he could sell more copies. Fat of the Land was awesome and still is till this day. This is just f**kin' GARBAGE. Don't even bother buying it, waste of money."
2,Let's Forget it All...,"I've been a fan of the Prodigy for the better part of a decade and had been waiting for this album for quite some time. I must say that I'm more than a little disappointed. I really only like a few tracks on this cd, my favorite being the opening track, Spitfire. I'm not a music expert and not the most talented dj, but I think I might've been able to better. I remain a big fan of the Prodigy and hope for a better comeback in the future. Sorry Liam, but you really should've at least had a few tracks with Keith and Maxim."
1,I NEVER HEARD PRODIGY LIKE THAT. THIS IS SUCKS!!!!!!!!,"What happened to the best band in the world? I used to love them. I used to collect everything related to this band.Several years they didn't come up with anything, just one single. And now this sh**...""Experience"", ""Music for the Jilted generation"", ""Fat of the land"" was 100000 stars.This one - ""AONO"" sounds so unprofessional. Few minutes listening to it makes you want to through up. This is such a bad performance. Prodigy is gone...."
2,"It's no ""Jilted"" or ""Fat of the Land""","I will say right off the bat that this is not a bad album. The beats are original, the vocals are very peculiar and intriguing, but for some elusive reason, this album did not impress me. ""Fat of the Land"" was absolutely outstanding in my opinion, and the single from a short while back ""Baby's got a Temper"" was very good as well. However, this album came nowhere near living up to the previous Prodigy albums for a couple of reasons: the songs are somewhat repetetive and has several songs with VERY obnoxious, grating samples/loops. I will say that at a party under the influence of mind-altering substances, this is a great album to listen to. Not the kind of album you will listen to very many times, though."
4,I'f you are not happy>> go to www.prodigyremixed.com,"I'f you are not happy with the album,perhaps you should check thishttp://www.prodigyremixed.com-i like the remixes lot better than than the original tracks"
4,Finally!,"Eventhough i had purchased this cd the day it was released, and being a fan of prodigy for 11 years now.. i have to say this album is extremely brilliant on Liam's part. New fans may not appreciate it, but for those loyal prodigy fans that have been around... this album is deffinetely worth buying. The beats are amazing and its totally different than Fat of the land and previous prodigy albums. This is not fat of the land part two... so if you're expecting 'Breathe' and 'Firestarter' this cd may not be for you.I suggest listening to tracks 1, 2, and 5 seeing as those were the singles from AONO.Cheers!"
3,"Prodigy, The Fat of Something Different.","I wrote a review about this before, luckily it never got posted. I changed my mind on giving it five stars. Why? Because it could have been a lot better. There are 3 or 4 good songs and the rest of them are either okay or crap. Don't get me wrong I have been a fan of Prodigy for a long time and I think Howlett is great, but this cd is nothing like The Fat of the Land or any of his past ones. I give him support for trying something new, but I wasn't impressed. The great thing about Howlett is that he doesn't give a damn about people who don't like his work.So would I go buy the cd? YES, I would. Even though it is different, it's still good. There's songs that have really good bass, beat and pump you up. The rappers sound awesome, the singers for the other hand could of sounded better, but all well. Maybe the rest of them will get back together again. LET HOPE FOR THE BEST."
3,Rock to this bondage soundtrack,"About a third of the tracks on this album will really rock you. The rest are fairly repetitive. But they all will give you hard electro. I could swear Howlett uses some of the same loops that he has in previous albums. You will also recognize that he enjoys the high wailing sounds, like those of a small animal dying in a painful way. But nonetheless. He's got talent, or else he wouldn't have made such a name for himself. In ""never outgunned"" Prodigy delivers the hard hitting big beats and the hard synth to go with it. Good songs to fill in the background of all that whipping and moaning. ;)"
2,What is this crap?,"Every album that prodigy has brought forth has been outstanding. When you think they've outdone themselves with experience, They come out with fat of the land which was a different style but still an excellent album within thier time. Thier albums have always been high quality. I figured that they had two or three really good albums left in them. Yet it takes them years and a bad single ""babys got a temper"" to put forth all this time and effort to come up with this junk. I can't believe they had to use a sample from a michael jackson album to make what they though was a creative track. This album is worthy of a basement startup using crappy equipment and no experience. They should have stopped when they had a chance and kept everyone wondering what beautiful music these legends could have created if they hadn't stopped at fat of the land."
1,ONE word: L -A-M-E,We waited all those years after Fat of the Land for THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Yuck
2,Can't believe it took seven years to make this album...,"1997: I was 22, partying hard, living the life in Britain. The release of ""Fat of the Land"" one week before my birthday was the greatest. All the clubs were remixing all the tracks, and the disc never came out of my player. Seven years later, I am married, have a new baby and live in the 'burbs. I have to say I would have been really sad if this CD had been anywhere near as good as Fat of the Land, because it would have made me feel old... now I just feel glad knowing that the Prodigy were at their prime when I was in my prime partying years. I own and still listen to all my Prodigy CD's, but I think this one will collect dust. I gave it two stars instead of one just because it's the Prodigy. ""Girls"" is the only halfway decent track, and it doesn't even sound like them. ""Baby's Got a Temper"" was better than half the tracks on the album. Disappointing..."
2,The Hunters,The editing in this book was terrible. Mrs. became Mr. throughout. Words were joined together which made reading a real challenge. Story was good but very difficult to read due to editing.
3,Good little book,There are only a few recipes in this book but they are simple and the dogs seem to like them well enough.
4,Fun book,"I really enjoy making the recipes in this book and my dog really enjoys eating them (as do the dogs in his obedience class). I have only two issues with the book. First, I don't think that the batch sizes were changed from the original book to accomodate the smaller bone cookie cutter size, because I always end up with many more treats than it says I should have (not that my dog is complaining). Also, there are no recipes for dogs who have corn and wheat allergies as all call for either corn or wheat flour although I'm sure with a little work you could substitute oat or rice flour. All in all a fun and creative book!"
4,Doggylicious,"So far my 'lil guy loves the peamut butter biscuits and so do his friends, Diesel and Samantha. I would highly recommend this book for a natural treat you make for your pet."
4,My dogs give it dew claws up!,"I've never seen my retrievers behave so well as when I'm holding one of these homemade biscuits up to them. I've given them as gifts to friends' dogs as well. Although I've seen other biscuit recipes, these are EASY to make, with ingredients most people already have in their cupboards. However, I have found that I have to bake the biscuits longer than recommended, otherwise they stay a little moist and will get moldy. The folks at my vet's office have begged for the recipes to the diet doggy bones and the peanut butter biscuits. Now, I never make my husband cookies without making a batch for my dogs as well."
4,Funny Doggy Cookbook,A book with a nice variety of treat recipeseasy to make and delicious and healthy for your doggy.Ingedients are easy to find on the local grocery store.A good gift for kids that loves doggies:nice illustrations and easy recipes.(I bought an used book and the cookie cutter not arrived.)Shipment was fast.
4,Shadow Box; the play,Very moving and interesting play centered around four families and their dying loved ones in a hospice-house setting. Each group deals with death in their own way.
5,Thanks. Good doing business with you,Best price and the item exactly matched the description. Thanks again for being honest about the item. Continue the good work
5,STOP! LOOK! LISTEN!,Ray Stedman captures the heart of God with the message of this book. It is a MUST read for every member of the Body of Christ hungry for deepth and meaning in the Church.It is a call to our roots; our foundation; our very reason for being the Body of Christ!!
5,Excellent book on how to set up a small Fellowship,"Our Fellowship started about 20 years ago using this model. As time goes by things change, we are now in the process of trying to get back to the basics outlined in this book."
5,"The Church Revitalized, Invigorated and Invigorating","[...] was the URL recently taken by First Presbyterian Church of Coeur d'Alene (on Facebook, too!) as a new pastor began serving last December, ""shaking things up"" and ""equipping the saints"" as Ray Stedman puts it in this book about similar activity at Peninsula Bible Church in Palo Alto, California. I've found my church home at long last, getting involved and several months later, becoming a member of this Protestant-Reformed-Evangelical-Presbyterian (as the Christian religion development tree goes) family. I gave this book to Pastor Craig as it describes the analogous things happenin' here.Would you ever think you'd see an old rolling tool cabinet, and sawhorses on the chancel stage, with guys packing in lumber as part of the scripture message for Father's Day? How about a demonstration of the ""Man Hug""?Each of us is the dwelling place of God and, as the FPC bulletin credits state,""Ministers; every member of the church."""
5,This beautiful album,"The album was a nice surprise for me, I had their latest albums and I never knew how was the sound at their beginning. In some ways it remains me The Sundays, with this guitar-heavy melodies and the angel voice from Leigh Nash is remarkable, also the lyrics are very poetic and inspirational. It is really worth to have this album."

1,Possibly the Worst Movie I Have EVER Seen.,"I sat downt to watch this movie with some hope because I generally like Hugh Grant movies, but this movie is absolute garbage. The first half is simple to undestand, but it is boring. The second half is the most incoherent 45 minutes in cinema history. I still do not fully understand this movie. Please anyone reading this do NOT waste time watching this movie. I would rather stare at a blank screen for the same amount of time than watch this mess again."
1,We never did finish viewing this movie,"I have to agree with the views expressed by everyone here. We invited friends over to watch it and, after waiting what seemed an endless time for everything to start making sense, not one out of six of us wanted to finish it. Like others here, we couldn't understand why someone like Hugh Grant should have accepted a role in a movie with such a muddled plot."
1,I watched the whole thing but then again I am autistic this stuff made me laugh myself silly!,The whole movie makes no sense at all. Talk about violence for violence sake. There is not one single solitary frame of this mess that would be worth paying a penny to see unless you just want to torture yourself. This movie is nothing personified and taken to heights few other directors will ever reach or want to. Poor Hugh Grant what kind of day must he been having when he said ok to staring in this dreck! Night Train to Venice avoid this ride at all costs. Take the Last Train to Clarksville Instead!
2,doesn't bolt down tightly,"Avoid. A nut and bolt system with two washers is used to attach the short threaded piece to the end of the wall arm. Well, guess what, there is no way to prevent it from yawing back and forth every time you bump the PJ, no matter how much you tighten the bolt."
1,Total Ripoff,Complete piece of garbage and doesn't include anything you need......take your 40 and light it on fire.....completly disgusted and now I have to buy some other part to make it work. What a joke Amazon.
4,Dark Homosexual Overtones Killer Inuedos,"True Metal Classic,In Terms of being a bent musical Journey by a man who is still cleary in the closet.From the Lords Prayer depiction of white heat red Hot, To The overt Homosexual endo of Stained class,""wild eyed and tight fisted-I'm fused to the bone, I stand conteplating alone,Impaled with betral"" Transfixed at deliverence is this all there is?Fierce is my conviction absolute my belief. Man get the The shrink into examine that Retric, Then ""the fire Burns Below"" a true Homo Love song, Kids read the lyrics to that Gay love Poem. But this being said I loved Queen and thought freddy was just a great front man! The reason I now in my late 30's are digging Priest is above all there killer riffs, And the Tounge in Cheek gay overtones that have bluffed a generation."
3,Still discovering themselves,"This album, like the one before it (Sin After Sin), suffers from lackluster production values. While this album has greatly improved in the low end, it seems the guitars are thinner than ever and largely buried in the mix.Another disappointment with this release is that the music is largely forgettable. There are a couple stand-out tracks, namely ""Beyond the Realms of Death"" (one of their all-time greats), and the curious cover, ""Better By You, Better Than Me"" (written by Gary Wright of ""Dreamweaver"" fame), but the rest don't seem very focused and don't stick with you after the music ends. This will not be the case with their next release.This album introduces a new drummer to the fold (Les Binks), but his tenure with the band will not last long. Too bad, too, because his style of play complemented the band better than any other drummer to sit with the band.If you are a casual fan, this would not be the first album to pick up."
3,"A classic, but I cannot rate this more than 3 stars...","This album is classic, mainly if you measure it against today's low quality bands. But I cannot rate it five stars because this is a remaster with bonus tracks. If it was simply a remaster with only the original songs, it would deserve a better rating. But the trouble with this Remasters series of Judas Priest albums is indeed the quality of the bonus tracks!!!!! They are simply awful!! In STAINED CLASS, Priest added a monstruosity called THE FIRE BURNS BELOW, a freak with programmed drumming and cheesy lyrics, almost unbeliavable!!! Other than this, the live version of one of the songs already included in the album..big deal...The positive point is the booklet with lyrics, because band comments are also weak and terribly short."
3,True ? Classic ? British ! Heavy ? Metal,"This album is definitely one of the Priest's best, along with British Steel. And it sounds too 1978-ish now, and it is history more then art. I never like this band and even their best records look like some comix to me. Absolutely best song on this album is not Priest's at all - Gary Wright's Better By You Better Than Me. Listening this song I clearly realize - this band just can't write music themselves."
3,Production kills this,"The problem with this album is the really bad production. The material is mostly first rate with only a few sub-par songs ('Invader', 'Savage'). However, i can't give it higher then a 3 because it sounds so tinny and weak that great songs like 'Exciter' 'Better By You..' 'Saints in Hell' and 'Beyond the Realms of Death' suffer for it's shoestring budget hack production qaulity. Yeah, i know it's 78, but still this album is basically de-fanged from this flaw. All of Preist's 70's albums have bad production but this is the worst!My suggestion is to get 'Unleashed in the East' to really hear how these songs should sound.It wasn't untill they got an actuall professional producer in the form of Tom Allom that they would start to sound good."
2,FIVE STARS W/O THE BONUS TRACKS!!,"Title should be ""A Lesson In How To Ruin A Classic And Make More Money By Adding Bonus Tracks"". Throw this right in there with Jethro Tull, Lynyrd Skynyrd and Blue Oyster Cult for 70's retreads of the year. How many more ways can companies package this stuff? My advice is to find the original ""Stained Class"" cd release on eBay or zShops for a third of this price. The sound on this remastered verison doesn't show a great improvement over the original. And after one listen you'll just skip over the bonus tracks every time."
5,An Incredible Music Experience,"If you have any interest in the heavy metal genre, this outstanding album simply must be in your collection. Judas Priest really poured their hearts and souls into making every part of this masterpiece just perfect. Bone cruynching guitar riffery, incrdibl drumming wizardry, an excellent producton sound, and a tour-de-force vocal performance from the greatest front man heavy metal has ever seen, Rob Halford. This album iks one of metal's defining moments. Priest influenced so many people with this release, unleashing the New Wav Of British Heavy Metal. And the thing that makes this album so remarkable is that music of this intensity was not beng made around the late seventies. Staineed Class is the producto f origional thought that helped create what is heavy metal. Every song i perfectly crafted. Just pure brilliance from one of the most remarkable musical frces of all time--Judas Priest!"
5,The BEST heavy metal record of all time!!,"This is the single best heavy metal record of all time. BOTTOM LINE! Every single song on Stained Class rocks hard from start to finish. The twin guitar attack of Glenn Tipton and KK Downing and the soaring vocals of the metal god himself, Rob Halford, will leave you speechless. This album influenced an enormous variety of artistts, not to mention it pioneering thrash and speed metal. It still has the power to melt any record that you put next to it just like it did more than 20 years ago when it was first released in 1978. This record will destroy any of your Metallica or Iron Maiden records. You will throw your Korn and Limp Bizkit records out the window after you give Stained Class a listen. Buy this record and hear the most influental metal band of all time, Judas Priest, in their prime. You will not be dissapointed."
4,Priest rocks!,"Amazon obviously bought a boatload of the box-set and broke them up. I would've preferred this was a ""singular"" release but the CD is awesome, nonetheless...."
2,Demos?,"First off I am a huge Judas Priest fan. I consider Screaming and Painkiller some of the best albums ever...of any genre but compared to those albums this one sounds like a demo. It's obvious the ""Priest"" sound was being solidified and still in the works which is why I say it seems like your listening to demos rather than a finished album.Either Halford learned to control his instument better or the engineer and producer didn't know how to capture him because as blasphemous as it sounds his high notes get annoying on Stained Class. When Halford goes high on Devil's Child on Screaming the effect is mind-boggleing but on Stained Class it can sound like cats fighting.Sorry to say but this album is only for hardcore fans or to complete a collection."
1,made in USA or Made in Japan,"just recieve this audio cd,do not buy this.you will not get the Japan made audio cd,sorry.not for 8.29.Warning/////////////////"
2,OVerrated,"I can assure you that this album is overrated. SIN AFTER SIN and HELL BENT FOR LEATHER (KILLING MACHINE) are clearly better than STAINED CLASS. They have more focus, more punch, a consistent line of work.The riffs in STAINED CLASS are weak and uninspired (exception: EXCITER and BEYOND THE REALMS OF DEATH). The album is not bad, but the others albums are better."
4,Surely it's Stained Glass not Class,"In the song Halford sings about a king in stained glass.[""..and now he's just a stained glass king..""]He clearly enunciates ""G"".It doesn't make any sense otherwise.He's referring to the kings and queens that you see in English cathedral windows.Even the cover art shows a modernist stained glass window style.I'm sure that funny little owl like creature that you see in the artwork is in a famous stained glass cathedral window in perhaps Coventry Cathedral??That's around about where these guys were born.I suggest a listen and also read the lyrics."
3,Winterizing your birds,"Birds get thirsty when the temperatures drop below feezing. This compact device solves the problem with automatic temperature control. It works well, but I gave it only 3 stars because the cord is so short as to require special techniques to reach a power outlet. GFCI outlets trip easily when any portion of the connection to an extension cord gets wet -- turning your birdbath into a skating rink. With a little ""engineering,"" you can make this thing reliable."
5,Cool gadget,I'm usually wary of products I haven't tried before. This thing really works. It is 28 degrees out now and birds are all over this birdbath since the water is thawed. The other birdbath is totally frozen! I love seeing happy birdies! It also makes you realize how much birds need water even in the winter. Would highly recommend this and might order another for the frozen birdbath also...
3,Works well - maybe too well,My only concern with this product is that it uses a lot of power and makes the birdbath steam on cold mornings. The unit used previously only used 30 watts and kept a hole in the ice adequately.
2,A work of scholarship,"Of little interest to the average reader, this work, while reflecting enormous work, does little to entice or offer anything we didn't already know."
5,Learn with pleasure,"This textbook is excellent for introducing people to the field of nuclear medicine. The book is divided in two parts: basic principles, chapters 1-4, and clinical scintigraphy, chapters 5-15, including one chapter entitled Pearls, pitfalls and FAQ. The book keeps the pace with the innovations occurred over the last five years since the first edition was published. The fundamental concepts of physics, nuclear pharmacy and instrumentation, are so pleasant and clear to read that easily will capture the attention of the busiest clinician. Residents are the main target of this book, but all those who teach nuclear medicine will find it useful for preparing their lectures as the sharpness is a main feature of the book. The book shows that the authors know perfectly what they write about, as they have taken the time to write what needs to be written concisely: for sure the authors enjoy their profession and care for patients by providing students with an excellent tool."
3,not the best introductory text,It's not a stellar member of the essentials series.I only read the first three or four chapters. There are many typographical errors and factual inconsistencies in the material that I read. I thought that by the third edition things like this would be ironed out. Hopefully by the 4th ed they'll get fixed.
5,Nicely Done!,"This is the second book I have purchased from this publisher. These books have some of the cutest baby photos I've ever seen!An original idea, well laid out and charming photos make these books fun."
5,25 years later still informative and relevant,"I bought the 1979 edition primarily for the contributions by the artists Tee Corinne and Honey Lee Cottrell as it was published at the start of their careers and contained in a major mainstream publication. Interesting antidote, the editor declined to include a particular artwork by Ms. Corinne that subsequently became iconic in magazines, books & posters and is still in print.I was very impressed that the majority of the book was an interesting to read and very well illustrated. I understand that this was one of the first illustrated guides that used explicit photographs to educate professionals and the public about human sexuality.It would be interesting to get this 1982 edition to see what the additional 30 pages contributed."
5,HIGH TECHIN' ON MINES,"This is my favorite rapper because I feel where he is comin'from and know what he is talkin' about. Keak, BA, and AGE much luvfrom ya ( ) from 916 Earllin42k@hotmail.com. I know ya man funk who mastered real talk. tell him I said what's up. YO Biggest fan EARL! sac,ca West side till I die. Stakin chips in the ATL for right now so get at me. END"
3,Not just more chilly than charming; surprisingly tedious in places as well.,"Mr. Olney was one of the truly great writers about food and wine, and his other works will be classics long after this one is deservedly forgotten. It has great value as a character study, but I ended up feeling pity and a sense of relief that it was over, and promptly began to re-read his other works to remind myself of his remarkable achievements. For timeless writing, read almost anything else he ever wrote instead, and forget this mean-spirited and roughly written assemblage"
5,No Comparison,"I would say that there is no comparison between Harry Potter books and the Artemis Fowl series. I never once thought of Harry Potter while I read it. To compare the two is like comparing The Chronicles of Narnia to Harry Potter. They are equally imaginative and original, but obviously in categories of their own. Artemis Fowl is an outstanding book series that always left me excited about getting my hands on the next book. I read these books as an adult and am now seeking an interesting book series that my 4th grade son can get excited about. I imediately thought of Artemis and the action packed adventures told from the villian's point of view,whom ends up acting heroically despite himself. You've got to love the different approach. It was fantastic!"
4,Good book,"Artemis Fowl happens to be a greta book for someone who likes fairies leprechons and other things in that sort of group. Writing this review, I am only half way through the book so, can not give a full review. My cousin enjoys it too. I like this book alot. I'd recommend for ages 10-14. This book may be hard to follow along with for younger children, but this book is great with mystery and fairies and leprechons.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,calebs book review,"Artemis Fowl is a magical action story. In the beginning Artemis goes to Cairo to visit a sprit. He goes to download a book. Next he captures a fairy named Captain Short. The fairies try to get Captain Short back. They send in a troll to kill Artemis to free her, then they send ransom money. They get Captain Short back, but then they want their money back. Finally, they bombed the house, but Artemis and Butler, the butler, survive."
5,Creative and FUN!,"I've read the 5 books of this series and cannot wait for the 6th! This author has a wonderful imagination and sense of humor! The earth-eating, flatulent Mulch Diggums is my favorite character! I wonder who'll be cast to play his part in the movie? hmmm"
4,Adult review - story is fun and creative,"I honestly enjoyed this book. I laughed out loud in many occassions, also had suspense and even a small tear of joy at the end. I didn't find the plot predictable, it took interesting directions. Of course this is a short book so you wouldn't expect a ton of character developement, but there was a good variety with decent dialog. It is certainly worth a try."
3,It was very good but...,"I read this book cause it sounded really good...based on the reviews. The stroy was VERY good but thier were things that weren't so great. For example they used bad words. This might not be a concern but...Other than that problem though, it was one of the best books I've ever read!"
3,More like an airport book for 12 year old boys,"I feel duped by these reviews. This book would be perfect for my 11 year old cousin, but is by no means a great book for all ages as these reviews would indicate. It is very slapstick and dorky. You could read the whole thing in a day and forget it even sooner. Also, Artemis Fowl is a punk."
3,Good but not GREAT,"This book was pretty good but it wasn't WONDERFUL. Plus, it's kind of hard to like Artemis himself because he's...in a way...evil. Not EVIL EVIL, but yeah. He's the bad guy here. But as for the positive points of this book: it gives you a whole new perspective because you're reading the view of the BAD GUY instead of the GOOD GUY(s), it mixes fantasy in with it all, and it's a pretty good plot. A whole new world is included and intertwined with ours. It's an okay book. If you're really into fantasy and whole new world type stuff, then buy it and read it! If you're not THAT into it or whatever, then don't."
1,Disappointment galore!,What a disappointment. People say if you like Harry Potter you'll like Artemis Fowl. Not a chance. I regret buying and reading it. I wouldn't even recommend checking it out from the library. The characters are all shallow and flat. The story wasn't even amusing...
4,bad main character,"I'm confused. Artemis Fowl is actually the antagonist of this story. How can the main character of a book be the antagonist? He is very un-likeable to the point where i almost put the book down. Here we have these good likeable fairy creatures and this spoiled rotten little boy just terrorizes them. I actually wanted him to die at the end. I think maybe this author got his priorities wrong when he developed this story. If the reader doesn't like the main character, then there's a problem. I will buy next book in this series and hope that Artemis becomes a bit more likeable. If i was still 12 years old and i saw Artemis on the"
3,NOT THE BEST THERE EVER WAS......,"this book was certainly very intricate but not very exciting. at times it was really boring , so thats why i only gave it 3 stars. but, i think as the the series go on they get better and better the last (opal deception) being the best so far. if you're looking for a great fantsy/otherworld books i would certainly reccomend the Stravaganza series by mary hoffman. Now those books rock.............."
1,What?,"A lot of people have told me to 'read this book, it's so great!' I do not believe that so many people like this book. I read the first three chapters and I just didn't like it.If you want a good book about a teenage criminal mastermind, a good choice is Stormbreaker or Point Blanc by Matthew Horowitz. Those books were good reading, and Artemis Fowl just wasn't worth it."
2,Not worth it!,"Bought it after havin read so many good reviews about it but it wasn't worth it.The idea of creating a fairy tale world with all the wickedness and injustices there are in our world& making the hero Artemis Fowl so cold,calculating(""genious"") and ""foul"",didn't go down well with me.Not at all a book i'll recommend my children to read,even for all the ""fairies"" in it.Not to my friends either!!"
1,I don't understand why people like this book...,"I totally agree with the other reviews with one star. They said it better than I could, but there is one thing I'd like to add, I was forced to read this in fourth grade and I practically slept though the whole book then failed test we had to take after. What I say is [...] on fourth grade teachers who make their kids read a book they didn't even like.I thank you for reading this and also add you might enjoy: The Amulet of Samarkand (The Bartimaeus Trilogy, Book 1) or The Thief Lord."
1,Wow this is horrible,"I love young adult's literature. Rowling, Sage, Stroud, Funke, have been providing literature that is not only for children but open minded adults for years. It was during a period where I was searching for more of this type of compitent writing that I stumbled on this ridiculous mess.The prose in this series are horrible. They rival such junk authors as Goodkind and Jordan....actually as impossible as it sounds, they are worse than both authors.The story is not fantastical...it's stupid. Police called LEPreCONs HOW WITTY.Oh and while we're at it let's have a protagonist who has the depth of a slice of cardboard.I found myself looking at plot mistakes and implausibities more than reading the story....it made for a very hilarious read.Fantasy is great....farce is a waste of time.This book tops the waste pile...Computer wielding elves....INGENIUS...."
5,Schweet Like A Lemon,"Amazingly fantastic, fun, funny, zanny and original. Super Kewl. Artic Incident here i come. Eoin Colfer u had better hurry up and write some more!"
4,One of my favorite books ever !!,"I really liked the book because it had a terrific plot and lots of discriptions . I recommend this book because it has a series and its exciting. I have also read "" Artemis Fowl and theArtic Incident"" , and "" Artemis Fowl and the Eternity Code"".I just syarted another of his books and (The Wish List) and it's already good."
5,Go for the gold,Read about Artemis Fowl's decieving plans to steal the treasure of the fearies as Holly(another fearie) desperately tries to prove herself to Root and gets captured.. She tries to free herself but she cannot do it and Root cannot re-enter the mansion becaus ot srict rules.Artemis Fowl was a GREAT book and I highly reccomend it.
2,Spazzer's Comments,"Thank God I did not but this book, but checked it at the library. I wouldn't say it's complete utter crap but I don't understand why people like it so much.First of all, I would like to point out that his feelings are mainly stereotypical. I can't imagine anyone feeling THAT way when intelligent, with a guard, and finding fairies. He should have some respect for his parents.Anyway, this book would mainly appeal to the younger audience. Don't buy the book, just check it out first, cuz you might regret it later."
5,Good read!,"This was a very witty foray into fantasy. It did a great job of making things like fairies believable. I especially enjoyed Artemis' strategies. Just when you thought he was down, he'd come up with something.This book was great fun."
2,A warning for parents.,"I know that this book is extremely popular, and I'm definitely not one to believe that censorship is the key to healthy children, but I was amazed and troubled by this book, and by the fact that it's on many school reading lists.Within the first couple of chapters the reader is introduced to the main character who favors a body guard that is trained to kill, tortures and drugs an alcoholic fairy (yes, I understand the humor of it, but I'm not sure it's a good message to send to kids), and is the youngest member of a family with a long criminal history. Artemis has no redeeming qualities, and he is, as one reviewer put it, ""a nasty little boy."" Definitely not someone I want my daughter looking up to. If this was a book for teens I wouldn't have a problem with it, but there is no way my kid is going to read it before the age of thirteen."
2,Artemis Fowl Book 1,I enjoy the Harry Potter series and the Eragon (Inheritance) series much more than Artemis Fowl. I would not recommend this purchase.
5,Artemis Fowl Review,I loved the book Artemis Fowl but in the beggining it was kind of hard to understand.
4,A Great Book to Read,"Artemis Fowl is an interesting book. It is about a criminal mastermind. He discovers the world of the faeries and kidnaps one of them, but he is unaware that these faeries are dangerious.The book, in general, is well organized, and interesting. It has many twists and turns. However, the language is awkward and hard to understand part of the time."
4,Good and Bad,"Artemis Fowl was good and bad at the same time. I couldn't really get the characters at first and the ""People's"" names were hard and complicated. But this book had a sense of humor and was full of action. (Although I could not really understand it!) But overall, it was a cool book."
2,Disappointed yet Intrigued Reader,"I bought the first three books(I'm guess there is supposed to be more) and when I cracked the first one I felt there was something missing. The characters seems to be stale and overly animated to make up for it. I read on, thinking that it would get better, but I'm sorry to report I stopped halfway through the third ""novel"" and can't bring myself to finish reading the series. However, on the upside, I believe the book was written for younger readers that may still need the stereotypical characters to help them understand the non-existant dynamics of this book.So as not to be completely harsh, I enjoyed the premise of the book moreso than the writing itself and found the ideas it presented interesting if not overly absorbing."
4,Dont pass this book up,Artemis fowl was absolutely a wonderful book. It is fantasy novel. This book was good for all ages. Its very interesting and never has a dull moment. This book draws you to it by the cover.Once you get into it you not going to have any luck putting it down. the fathar you get into the more you wont want to put it down. Dont pass this book up.
5,A great sci-fi book for kids and teens!,"Artemis Fowl, a 12 year old genius and prodigy does the unbelieveable. He reveals a whole new race that lives underground that nobody else knows about. They are ....... the faries.Faries, in human minds, are pictured as short, small, winged creatures that are quiet and nice. Well, they're wrong! Read this adventure packed book as Artemis Fowl reveals and sees what no human has ever seen before but the question is, will he live to tell the tale? Read and find out(at your own risk)!"
5,a great read,"Though it starts out slow, Artemis Fowl quickly becomes a vastly interesting tale full of humor and action. Eoin Colfer has created a wonderful cast of characters, and it is especially interesting to watch how Artemis Fowl changes, and how his relationship with Captain Short changes as well. This is definetly a great book for teens to read."
5,Truly wonderful!,"I was concerned about a series of books with a ""villain"" as the main character, but this series of books is utterly fabulous. I am a voracious reader and still but these books are stand-outs. They are extremely creative and wildly imaginative. Artemis is worth every moment, whether you love him or hate him!"
4,I can't believe I like it,"I picked this up after seeing how much fan fiction there is out there for the Artemis Fowl universe.This is a great book for fluff reading. The plot is compact, the writing simple but not simplistic. Even though myths are mixed in with the latest in technology everything sounds believable, which is pretty unbelievable in itself"
4,"Great, awesome...b ut I can't quite give it 5 stars","This book has a good plot, intersting charachters, and an evil hero. Awesomeness, but some parts were sort of cheesy. Definantly worth reading, though! Artemsi Fowl:The Arcitc Incident is another good read!Oh, but don't read it if you aren't into fantasty and action movies!"
4,Really good.,"This book has been around for a bit and i've heard good things, so when audible had a sale I gave it a shot. It is actually a very clever work of fiction with some fascinating characters. I bought into the story right away and I really felt that Mr. Colfer did a great job of creating a magical subculture that was believable, exciting, and all the while, right under our feet. Really well done with some great plot twists. The story moved along at a steady pace and I even found myself chuckling several times. Lots of fun, I'll read the next one..."
4,Great Book!!!!!!!!!!,"I think that this book is amazing. Colfer does an eccelent job developing the characters, and Artemis really evolves as a person. Also, the introdution of ""daddy"" lends a new element to the series.Hey, I've just received a free Minecraft Giftcode!You can get one too!>> minecraftcodes.me <<"
5,Can't get any better,The first time I read Artemis Fowl was when I was 10.I simply loved it and the rest of the series.As I got older and re-read the series I got every joke it was like I was reading a new book!!
5,"Great, Gritty Book","Eoin Colfer has earned my undying admiration: He writes a truly entertaining and unique youth novel. Artemis Fowl is complex, it's unpredictable, it's imaginative, it has some gruesome descriptions, and it is really, really good.Colfer's focal point is the wanna-be evil boy genius. He's all genius, but he can't quite bring himself to be truly evil, and the conflict in character is fascinating to read. Colfer latches on to a real problem that so many youth identify with, sadly--the absentee parents for reasons that even they can't always help. Although Colfer acknowledges this issue, he doesn't preach, he just lets it be, and allows Artemis to make his own mess and dig his way out.Colfer's imaginative LEP unit and Foaly are great fun to read. I can't wait to get into the second novel, and I would not hesitate to recommend this series to any upper elementary/middle school aged reader, either in years or at heart. :D Order the series without reserve and enjoy!"
4,Artemis Fowl,There is a 12 year old boy name Artemis. His father went missing one day and he wants to get his forunte back.The main conflict is that Artemis and his bodyguard name Butler kidnapped a fairy name Captain Short. He is going to show everyone the whole world who they are unless they give him tons of gold. Artemis says that he can escape the time stop. Can he really escape it or is he just lying to them?I like this book since it show that a 12 year old boy is really smart. Like how Artemis know where the fairies be when they have to renew there magic. What I dont like about this book is that they be talking about one charcter all of a sudden they switch to someone else and tell them about themselves. Like when Artemis is about capture a fairy. They go to Captain Short point of view. the other thing is that it have a prologue and a epilogue. So we know a bit about themself and what is going on.
4,Funny and Interesting. Love It!,"Artemis Fowl is a wonderful begining to Eoin Colfer's Artemis Fowl series. Complete with fairies, trolls, humans, magic, LEPrecon, futuristic weapons, friendship, crime, loyalty, and cunning plots, Artemis Fowl is a keeper to be read time and time again. Read it once, read it twice, read it a thousand times and it never gets old."
4,A great suspensful fiction novel,The reason I liked the book was because the author really described what he was talking about.Plus I really like dragon books.The author used a lot of adjectives witch describes the thing the author talking about. It was a very good book because it was very suspenseful book. I like how eragon found a blue rock that turned out to be a dragon egg.
2,Missing ... Good Writing,"Although full of good ideas, the writing in this book seemed somewhat scattered at best. Looks like someone on the editing committee missed a meeting. Not that great..."
2,What the???,"I read this book in 4th grade. Now in 4th grade I was in the age to be in 3rd grade, and my reading level was way above that. The only thing is that I couldn't understand the point of this book later on in 5th grade I tried to read it still couldn't understand it. This book is for someone with a highly bendable imagination. This book is written in so many precumpcious ways that I couldn't read it."
3,Not even close to Potter,"I bought this book based on the reccomendation that this book is similar to the Harry Potter series. I believe that this is a terrible comparison. That being said I did enjoy the book, but this is unfortunately nothing close to the Potter series."
3,I Guess.,"I mean, if you're bored, then you can read this book. I enjoyed reading it, even if it was weird. It was fun to read how smart the boy was, and his determination to catch the magical creature. Of course, there are so many other wonderful books to read, and that are much more clever than this one. I recommened reading it just to get a taste of the author's form of writing and the entertaining story line, but don't get your hopes too high."
2,A video game in book form,"Ok, it's a page-turner (hence the two stars). But what a shallow, insubstantial book. It's full of leprechauns eagerly sporting high tech weapons, an unscrupulous genius of a 12 year old boy accumulating unimaginable wealth (he's never called evil, but it's apt). Pretty graphic violence perpetuated by a pea-brained troll. Black and white characters of no substance whatsoever (unless you think Artemis' denial of his father's death gives him substance--oh, I see: another book in the making). Why bother with a book? Why not come out with the video game/bad movie and be done with it!Don't compare this to Harry Potter, or Lord of the Rings. If you want a book that can carry a plot and has characters with depth read those. If you want dental floss, read Artemis Fowl."
5,"Young adult fun for grown-ups, too","I read this on a plane trip out to Las Vegas, and thoroughly enjoyed it. It kept my attention for take-off to landing, and while in the hotel room, I found myself shushing my parents, so that I could finish the last few chapters!I've always liked fairy stories, and I found the mixture of magic and reality in this book to be quite well done. Even though Artemis Fowl is definately a ""bad guy"", I couldn't help but cheer him on, and hope that he managed to win in the end.I definately will be adding the rest of this series to my reading list!"
4,A Brilliant Mix,"Another reviewer called this ""Die Hard with Fairies"". I agree, but I'll compare it to a brilliant mix of James Bond and Star Trek with the classic fantasy creatures.Artemis is a 12 year old criminal mastermind and he's developed the master plan to steal gold from the underworld fairies. Only, it's not going to be easy because the fairies are nearly invisible to the human population (Mud People) and they have tech that Captain Kirk would LOVE to get his hands on and have packaged into nifty little gadgets that only James Bond could appreciate.I really enjoyed this book as I think all 5th grade and up children would. The combat, and the effects of it, are a little bit graphic for younger children.After you finish reading the book, there is a cryptogram to decipher as an added bonus for kids who like to solve puzzles. It's not a tough code to break, but still alot of fun.I look forward to more installments of this series."
5,Great series!,"This is one of my favorite books because Artemis Fowl (although the name Artemis is the name of a goddess, Artemis Fowl is not a girl ) is a genius and he's only 12. It is not often that you find a book with a 12 year old genius in it. In my opinion, the characters were well developed just like the plot. THis is a great series and I highly recomend it (even if your not a Hary Potter fan). Although this IS a great series, I do not recomend it to any one under 9 years of age just because the setting is kinda confusing. Well any way, this book is about a 12 year old crimenal mastermind who is determend to prove that faeries exist. The main charactors in this book are Artemis Fowl (obviusly), Butler ('Butler' is his last name. you don't know what his first name is.), Captain Holy Short ( a LEPrecon officer, also known as a faerie), Foaly (a centuar), and Camander Root ( another LEPrecon ).I hope this review helped you =)"
4,Artemis Fowl,I thought that Artimes Fowl was a great book. The beginning is a little bit confusing but you get it later on in the book. I finished it in three days. It is a book you do not want to put down. Reccomended to all.
4,Artemis Fowl Review,"Artemis Fowl was a tough book for me but it paid off because I enjoyed it. It is like a fairy tale in that there is a group of faries living at the center of the earth. Artemis is a really smart twelve year old, for his age. He is always thinking two steps ahead of everyone. Someone who likes adventure stories and is a good reader would like this book."
4,ARTEMIS FOWL,"<font size=""4"">I think that for the most part, that this was a well-written book. I envied Artemis Fowl and him being a genius. It was interesting reading and finding out how he solved certain problems and puzzles. There was some suspense waiting to see if he could escape some of the problems he found himself in. I know it was kind of necessary to tell about the LEPricons but a lot of that bored me. Artemis Fowl was much more interesting to read about. He was a kid super-genius. I would probably recommend probably to the people who enjoy reading the Harry Potter series and similar books. Overall, this book was well-written and i enjoyed it."
3,"Artemis Fowl, Book 1","This book reminded me greatly of many other fantastic fantasy books, such as Harry Potter. A young man battling geniuses and eventually getting what he wants.It didn't reach Harry Potter standards in my mind though. I found the parts about Artemises family and life fascinating, however, I found that there wasn't one key point in the book that really took me in, no point in the book that was so fantastically fascinating that I couldn't put the book down, it was really spread out. It's nice to have have a little bit of exciting bits here and there but in books like that you usually have one big Boom smack down in the middle of it, and I don't mean a bomb. I also founf captain Holly Short to be annoying and I really hated having to read the chapters about her to get to the good parts. This book is the kind that I'd read the first book of the series, but not the rest. It was a quick read though, and a bit of fun."
5,Excellent,"This is an excellent book, even for adults. I read (at least) a book a week, but over 95% of those are non-fiction. My wife tries to get me to read fiction, but usually fails (hard for anything to come close to my ""Lord of the Rings"" type of standard). My son, however, had an excellent idea -- he started a family bookclub where he chose a book for each of us to read and report on in three weeks. This was the book that he chose for me, which I read in a few days.The plot and characters are creative. I never ""knew"" so much about fairies! While it was easy reading, I got to know the characters. There was good flow, but still good transitions without appearing choppy. The printing was easy on the eyes and the book was comfortable to hold (which a surprising number of publishers seem to ignore). Definitely recommended for kids 10-15 and also for kids older than that!"
2,Vaguely disturbing: be cautious,"To be honest, I was seriously bothered by this book, and as that's rather unusual for me, I thought it was worth sharing.The writing wasn't bad, and the author was fairly inventive on several counts. At the same time, I thought some of the content was fairly questionable. Artemis is the most twisted twelve-year old imaginable. It's not just that he's a genius, or just that his life has been brilliantly harsh and cold. At twelve, twelve! this kid is cold as could be. There are a few cracks at various points, but he's generally cruel, calculating, and unrepentant. There's very little warmth between any characters in the book.The volume of deceit, manipulation, and arrogance in the book made it a surprisingly uncomfortable read. I kept reading it hopes that it would have a more redeeming end, and was sorely disappointed. In short, it's not a book I would feel at all comfortable recommending for children. Caution highly recommended."
3,too short!,"i sat down and nocked this book out in one sitting, i like a book thats a little more chalanging then this, then again, its ment for young adults"
4,Artemis Fowl: Criminal of the 21st Century,"What can I say? This is a great book. It isn't perfect, but it's pretty close. A 12-year-old criminal mastermind tries to capture a fairy and hold her for ransom but gets a lot more than he bargained for when the fairy turns out to be Holly Short, the only female officer in the Lower Elements Police. Basically, the book is about Artemis's attempt to kidnap her and the LEP's desperate attemps to get her back before they are forced to pay up. It ends when-hey,I'm not going to spoil the whole thing. Just read the book. Trust me, it's not hard. I've done it six times."
2,Am I supposed to like Artemis?,"A number of people recommended that I read this and I have to wonder why. The characters of Artemis Fowl and Holly Short are completely unsympathetic, bringing the entire narrative to repeated thudding stops, with all other characters seeming to have been culled from The Authors Big Book Of Stock Characters. The descriptions of the LEProcon and everything about them are detailed to the point of pedantical.The plot is interesting, however, and has a certain fascination that kept me reading. But I found the conclusion to be unsatisfying and quite anticlimatic. I had hoped for a lot more, and so started reading the second book in the series, The Arctic Incident. I didn't waste my time finishing it, and recommend you don't waste yours starting the first."
1,Complete crud .,"This is truly one of the worst books ever.Honestly ,how are you supposed to like the main character if he's a criminal mastermind ?How are you supposed to find it funny if the humor is complete gore ?Truly ,I don't understand how anyone can like this book."
2,Not as good as the first Artemis Fowl book,"The plot was more focused on the fairy characters rather than on the personality and behaviour of Artemis Fowl. It starts with the intrigiung idea that Artemis was going to rescue his father but most of the book was spent solving a revolt in the fairy world that Artemis had little to do with. Only at the very end does the rescue mission for the father happen, the name of the book should be changed to the Fairy World Revolt featuring Artemis Fowl."
3,This is OK,"This was not a great book - this is not a horrible book either - this is just straight up the middle, entertaining enough to finish, but not so much to continue the series - the is exactly fair to midland territory in novels - it is a good weekend read though - buy this used and not new"
4,Great Book!,"I am a tween girl reader, and I think this book was fabulous. It had an exciting plot that left you guessing what Artemis's plan was throughout the whole book. It had great offhand humor and is real middle-grade must read."
4,Gift For Son,"I bought this used book for my son, it is in good condition. I am satisfied with the service as well. So far it sounds like a a good book, I plan on buying the series for him..."
4,Refreshing!,"I read this book with my 8th grade class. Most loved it! It was very nice to see how they reacted to a main character who was NOT the ""good guy"". The subject matter and language were very appropriate and the addition of the secret message was cause for much questioning and investigation."
4,Great book,"This book is spectacular. It has lots of suspense and excitement. I was surprised by the ending of the book because it seemed like what Artemis did with the gold, didn't follow the plot. Artemis Fowl has lots of interesting characters such as: Butler, a super muscled bodyguard of Artemis, a 12 year old genius, criminal and millionaire. The only one to stop them is Captain Holly Short, a member of LEP, the fairy police. In this book Artemis has come up with an evil plan that associates with the fairies, elves and sprites. Read this book to find out what it is!"
2,Disappointing,"Having read so many positive reviews, I thought I had found an interesting book for the kids. I'm just glad that I read it first. (My children will not be reading this, not yet, anyway).I had very little sympathy for the character: a spoiled, selfish, arrogant, rich, criminal twelve year old. His inherited fortune has been built over generations of criminal activity. His father is either dead, or missing, and so Artemis, as head criminal of household, takes over.This child prodigy/computer genius then goes on to drug, threaten, con and in other ways deceive the ""fairies"" of the underground world in order to steal their gold.All the old favourites are here: dwarfs, goblins, elves, sprites and trolls. Except for Holly, one of the fairies, you don't care what happens to the underground world - its description is not really very appealing.Unfortunately, there is not much else to redeem this book and its really not the sort of children's book I want my ten and unders reading."
2,Promising Premise but Untimately a Waste of Paper,"Perhaps the target audience of this novel is elementary school-aged readers, but I must say this book was beyond mundane and would have a hard time keeping most sharp minds engaged. Too modern and then too organic. Too many creatures and characters without any depth of development or personality. I cannot even think of a character I liked, let alone any I would care to read about again. I hope no one is comparing this amateurish drivel to certain well written books about a boy wizard, because there is no comparison. Maybe this series will improve as it continues, but I doubt it. Two stars given for the imaginative aspects, only."
4,Tired of our world? Use your imagination and go into the world of Artemis Fowl!,"The book Artemis Fowl is a great book! It takes you into a world that you never thought that you world exsist. The book is about a young matermind. He is on a quest to trick the fairy world into giving him their precious gold. During the course of this book, there are true dynamic characters. There are also some very good morals of this as well. You learn that money isn't everything and that though it might be a little weird a friendship is the best thing that you could possibly have; even when you are trying to trick the smartest technology in the unknown world. The end of ""Artemis Fowl is truly remarkable. I won't spoil it for any of you reader's thinking about reading it though. It is a true piece of irony. I would recomend this piece of literature to anyone who as an open mind and imagination. This book truly is out of the known world. :D"
4,Long time favorite at our house,"With my kids this is a long time favorite, only bested by Stanek's The Kingdoms and the Elves of the Reaches. I doubt there are many kids who haven't read this yet, so I'll describe this for parents who may be reading this review. Artemis Fowl is about a boy genius (a criminal genius). His character is supposed to be dark but he's not really. It's more over the top fun than anything else. Other than a bit of farting nothing in hear I wouldn't want my kids to read. Personally I enjoyed it as well."
1,"granted I'm not 12, but","I still enjoy books aimed at that age group - like Harry Potter. I did not expect this book to be an HP clone, however, I hoped that I would encounter the same standard of writing. Sadly, I did not. I don't mind reading about the adventures of an evil genius and his sidekicks, rather than a character who is inherently good, but I would hope those characters would possess depth, humor and insight. However, so many reviewers feel differently, so perhaps there's something here that I'm missing."
1,Big disappointment,"After all of the great reviews, I was very excited about reading Artemis Fowl. However, it proved very disapointing. I might have enjoyed this a little more when I was for. It is a very young book and I do not reccomend it. I was also disappointed that the main charactor is a comeplete jerk. He is a jerk. The whole book you wait for the spoiled brat to become good but he never does."
4,Artemis Fowl,"Artemis Fowl is a mastermind with a sanity for a lost family fortune. In a undying scam to restore his family's fortune, Artemis thinks up with a plan to steal gold from the fairies. Artemis goes to vietnam and tricks a sickend fairy to give him the secret fairie book in exchange for life. Artemis has a scheme from start to finish one plan after another. artemis paralizes captain holly and forces the fairies to give him 30 grand. but they disagree and send a dwarve but the dwarve decides to go his own way and leaves the LEP force. artemis meets with the head of lep and negotiates with him. The lep decides the are not going wait and starts an attack with a troll. Butler gets fately injured. but captain holly short heals him. and he unmercily slayes the troll. the lep hands over the gold. and nope sorry cant tell you the end. to figure the code or get the ending rent Artemis Fowl at your local library. thank you for your time."
5,I've read it twice!!,"Artemis Fowl is amazing! No matter what type of book you like, Artemis Fowl has it. There are sprites, dwarfs, and centaurs for fan lovers. Futureistic weapons add tools for science-fiction lovers and there's even a kidnapping for you adventure lovers!The book is about a twelve year old genius who wants to recapture his family's billion dollar status. To do so, he is willing to commit crimes that will cross two worlds and nearly bring those worlds to an interspecies war! Who knew getting a leprecons gold would be so dificult?What more could you want in a book? I know I love Eoin Colfer's writing and I know you will too."
4,Artemis Rocks!,"I had the pleasure of using this book with my year eight class. After reading it myself in preperation for our unit I was delighted that I would have to study this book closely. This is a fantasy style book that is easy to follow, with vivid descriptions of the settings and characters.The plot is fast paced and as a result, I found it hard to put the book down - I read it it one sitting!This book is a lot of fun and certainly gives the imagination a workout. I recommend this book to people of all ages for a fun and exciting read."
3,Artemis Fowl,"The book that I just read is called ""Artemis Fowl"" written by Eoin Colfer. The problem is that Artemis wants to steal the richest treasure of the world. The treasure belongs to the fairies. The rising action is when Artemis and his friends go and see the treasure. The climax is when Artemis actully steals the treasure and almost gets caught. The falling action is that when they get home Artemis dad who has disappered is in his moms room. The resolution is that his dad was trying to steal the treasure from him. The main characters are Artemis, Holly, and Butler. My personl"
5,"A great book, Reviewed by a great reader :)","I am an 11 year old girl who read this a year ago. This is one of the best books I've ever read, and I've read a lot of books (trust me on this one). Mix 1 part humor, 2 parts fairy tale, and 10 parts adventure, and you get Artemis Fowl. Anyone who dislikes this is either braindead, or nuts.Oh yeah Artemis is NOT supposed to be a role model.P.S Haryy Potter is the BEST book series, and anyone who disagrees is INSANE. Thank You (smiles sweetly)"
2,Quite a Disappointment,"I had heard a lot about Artemis Fowl, and i must say the rave reviews that i read were not justified. The book was as stupid as the back cover made it sound.I will say that it was somewhat original, but the plot lacked any depth. The characters were extremely flat and boring.I ususally enjoy fantasy, but Artemis Fowl barely kept my attention."
1,Artemis Fowl,"I read some of the reviews and bought the book. Even though I had my doubts, people raved over it so I tried it. What a waste of money! I am an avid reader and rarely throw away a book but I think I will actually burn this one! Artemis Fowl is really a foul book. Who needs a book about a genius criminal 12 year old brat? It is a ""dark"" book. I for one do not waste my time putting such rubbish in my mind. This is not literature. A teacher used it in the classroom?! So much for our schools! How could anyone have compared this with Harry Potter?"
2,Potentially good,"The villain of the story, Artemis Fowl, is twelve years old and a good portion of the story is told from his point of view. This interesting point of view could have shed a whole new light on an overused idea; however, the parts of the story that are told from his point of view are not omniscient. We know some of what he's thinking, but not really enough to understand his motives or his plans. This leads to suspense, but it leaves me wanting more. So what we're left with is the usual story with an unusually young villain, and not much more. There is a lot of action, fighting, gore and some bodily functions that might appeal to young boys, but I found them unnecessary. The fantasy part of the story involving fairies, goblins, and trolls is really nothing new. The fairies seem unbelievable, arrogant, and a little stupid. I found it hard to care about them. The plot was interesting enough to hold my attention until I got to the end, but not much longer."
2,There are no sympathetic characters,"I thought this would be a good series to read, since it dealt with a young boy and the world of magic (and we were all hot in the grip of Harry Potter #5 when I bought it). However, this book is very disappointing. None of the characters stands out as likeable (either in a ""gee, I really like this person"" or a ""gee, what a great villain"") way, and the fact that Artemis seems to be out to infiltrate/irritate/rob/otherwise harm the magical world doesn't make for a good plot in my opinion. He seems like a Draco Malfoy without restraints (if you will pardon me referencing the Potter books again).The story was also a little bit coy, with terms like ""Lower Elements Police RECON"" becoming the term ""LEPrecon"" and such.I finished the book out of a dogged sense of persistence, but since there was nothing in it to interest me, I won't be carrying on with the series."
4,"Fun, fast read!","Artemis Fowl is a fairy tale turned upside down. Part villain, part hero, Fowl's intelligence and propensity for evil make him easy to dislike, but his weaknesses--his mother, Butler, and the wrestling-obsessed Juliet--let us see a softer side. This was a fun adventure with fairies, leprechauns, trolls, and dwarfs as you've never experienced them before! (Who knew dwarfs could shoot dirt out their butts??) Definitely a quick read for an adult, but quite fun. I'm looking forward to the next one."
2,Artemis Fowl,"The book I read was Atremis Fowl, written by Eilon Colfer. It is about a 12-year-old boy who tries to steal gold from fairies. The story was just ok. It was kind of boring. My favorite character was Mr. Butler, Artemis's bodyguard. The story took place in England. I would recommend this book to a friend because the ending is exciting."
3,"Good light read. Nice twist on ""fairy tales""","Ok, I'm an adult. But I love children's books.This is well written but is more of a ""boy"" book. There is some good old fashioned potty humor thrown in with good writing.I enjoyed the story and concept. I like that there is a good within the book you can decode (although I did not do it). The only caution I would give to parents is that there are some violent scenes in the book and you may want to read first for your smaller children.Definitely worth the read but not as well developed as some other ""magical"" stories."
4,Artemis Fowl Book Review,"Artemis Fowl by Eoin Colfer is about a 12 year old boy who is a genius but the sad thing is, he is also a criminal. One day he and his butler go to a forest and find a drunken fairy. Then they take this fairy book from it and translate it to English and then they figure out there is some sort of fairy Gold.This books theme is that you should never give up, never stop trying, and always keep your head up. For example, this fairy says Artemis can't do a certain task, but he still believes he can do it.I like this book because it always makes me wonder what's going to happen in the next chapter. I think it would make you have the same feeling. So maybe you should read this book."
5,Artemis Fowl,"There was a huge cloud of dust where the troll burst in! Do you like action packed books with a hint of suspense in them? If so, you should put down whatever book you're reading and read Artemis Fowl. In a thrilling adventure, Artemis Fowl captures a magical fairy and demands a ransom. The fairies then try some devious tactics such as sending in extremely brutal, non-sentient animals to slaughter Artemis, leading to one unthinable ending.Overall, reading this book is a great way to spend your time. This book should be for kids (and adults) ages 9 and up. this book would definitley satisfy anyone who reads it."
5,Cranmer: Master of the English Prayer,"""This edition brings prayer to life"", according to a former Archbishop of Canterbury. Anyone who has enjoyed the spiritual comfort of the Anglican Collects, will be moved by this wonderful source for appreciating the message of hope they convey. Frs. Barbee and Zahl tell the reader from what sources Cranmer drew the inspiration for his Collets. They also provide an understanding of their internal structure and how beautifully they are crafted as well. More movingly, they illuminate the message and spiritual insight relected in Cranmer's tightly compacted Collects with ""meditations"" that are along side each of them. These meditations connect the reader with the Collects, providing a spiritual illumination for which contemporary readers hunger."
2,Great book - Kindle edition is missing text,"This is a review of the Kindle edition.I bought this book to use as a devotional aid, but the titles for each Collect are missing. The way it is set up in the book, you cannot tell what season of the church year you are in, which makes the book practically very difficult to use. I returned it for a refund, and am considering buying the print edition, which looks a lot nicer. I hope the publisher fixes this problem, though - this would be a great book to have digitally for quick reference.The content, however, was fantastic from what I was able to read. I would certainly consider buying again if the problem was fixed."
2,Unfortunate errors in printing cover and title page that should have been caught,"This books is a photocopy reprint of a work that has been in the public domain and the publishers believe is worth keeping available. I agree with this. So, one must prepared for occasional poor photocopying of print, poor black and white copies of photographs/prints of paintings and drawings, pages printed slightly offcenter, etc. All these were no problem for me. What WAS a problem is the newly printed cover page and title page. On the Cover Page the title and authors are listed as:Puvis de ChavannesJean Laran, Andr?? MichelYes, that's right, instead of the correct French character(s) two question marks are printed as part of the second author's name!On the title page the authors are listed as:Jean Laran, Andr## MichelThese errors show a lack of attention to detail, carelessness, or just plain ignorance. I am VERY disappointed with this publisher."
4,If you like Austin Powers get all 3 movies for one price.,"I gave this collection 4 stars because you get all 3 movies for one low price. If you are looking for a deep, academy award winning movie that will have true meaning... THESE MOVIES ARE NOT IT. If you are looking for the caliber of police academy, naked gun, airplane, baseketball, etc. then you are in the right ball park. I bought it because it was a great deal."
2,2 disks,I was expecting three DVDs. One had two movies and which may be OK if it at least where labeled. Spend a little more money.
4,Guilty pleasure movies at a good price,"These movies started coming out when I was in high school. I was the perfect age to appreciate Mike Myers brand of humor. The movies haven't really aged that well and the quality certainly dropped off as the series progressed but at Amazon's price they are hard to pass up. Picture quality is good, as would be expected on BD. There are almost no special features to speak of but I don't know what else you would really want. If you enjoyed these movies the first time around they are worth picking up. Otherwise there is nothing here to get excited about."
3,Austin Powers is Pure Comedy!,"I am a fan of all Michael Myers movies. I loved the first two movies of series and am going too buy them soon! Too bad I can't say the same for the third one. The first ""Austin Powers"" movie is funny and not too crude (4 stars). The second one is funny, but is a little more crude (3 stars) and the third one is nothing but fart jokes (2 stars). If people agree wiht me, don't buy this whole entire series, just buy the first two. If you are a die hard fan, buy the whole pack.-Ben Russell"
4,Almost Groovy Baby...,"A true collection of silly, British-like comedy from Canadian,Mike Myers... Yep, CANADIAN Mike Myers! This slim case box set comes with the complete story or Austin ""Danger"" Powers: International Man of Mystery, from New Line Cinema, arm of Warner Home Video. Pristine anamorphic widescreen picture, dazzling Dolby True HD sound, and a plethora of co-stars you could shake your pinky finger at... which ""almost"" makes this set Groovy...What's missing from this, never-the-less stellar Blu-ray set? The Cameo Scene Selection from the first movie, that was included in the DVD. Trivial? Sure, but, for a nice shiny box that say ""with extra mojo"", I was expecting all features from all films in this collection... but again, trivial. The collection is still jam packed with goodies like trailers, commentaries, even deleted scenes!A Must Have!!"
3,Good movie - bad transfer,"As a fan of Austin Powers a have been waiting for a BD Edition for log time. However, when I finally got it I felt quite disappointed of picture quality. I had read review that the two first movies are awesome and the Gold member is not as sharp. IMoM and TSWSM have a huge grain so it's disturb me all the time . My kids and wife said is no way that is blu ray. I saw this movie on TNT year ago and have to say that looked awesome so I thought the blu ray edition will compare in quality, so sadly, I was wrong. If you are really fan of AP you can buy it, if you already own the DVD edition rather wait for better transfer for BD."
5,Present,"Another purchase for my son. He has a blue ray player now, he is building a collection of movies on blue ray."
4,yes please,what can you say about this? it was a great deal for 3 great movies in beautiful blu ray disc quality. Yes please.
3,love the movie but still costed a little more than it should,"I thought it should have been under [...] dollars a movie especially since they are around ten years old, but I like the slimmer box sets since I have over a thousand DVDs and need shelf space."
3,present,"this item will be a xmas gift, so thats why 3 stars only. im hoping they like the gift of power"
1,Does not work in Ireland,"I gave it one star because the dvds wouldn't play In Ireland be careful, I think it only works in America. Hope this helps."
5,True 3 discs in the set,We know the movies well so I will just comment on the technology parts. The HD picture quality is very good since these movies use popular bright colors in 70's. Vivid colors with crisp images. WOW! Sound is also great for 5.1 surround. It has regular 5.1 and Dolby 5.1 both in the sound selection. Even the regular 5.1 sounds great already! The extra features are also very generous. This set gets my 2 thumbs up. WORTH COLLECTING.
4,"Powers by name, Powers by reputation!",I'm not gunna review the movies...most people already do that. I just wanna say this collection is very much worth the money. I didn't even expect bonus stuff but each movie does have some.
3,"Excellent price, picture is grainy",I bought this box set and have watched it on both my 50 inch and 40 inch screens and there is still a grainy appearance on both. I enjoy the movies very much and am a huge fan of Mike Myers so I was quick to snatch this up. Less than $30 for all 3 films was great and the colors are vibrant and sound is excellent just a little grain on facial close-ups.
4,austin powers blu-ray collection,Picture is quite good but not great. Very little extras though. Dvd owners will be upgrading only for picture and sound.
5,Tri-excellent,"Can say enogh.If you like Mike Myers, you will love this trilogy.A must-have for all people that love comedy"
5,"Mi suh hai, een dah woo, mi wai hee woo tau. Subtitle: Buy It","I grew up on these movies as a kid. I had all of them on VHS and my brother and I memorized all the lines from the first 2. Beyonce annoyed me in Goldmember because she insisted on reminding everyone that she is indeed a ""whole lot of woman."" $5 per movie is an absolute steal and a great addition to my Blu-Ray collection so I can raise my kids on this someday..."
4,Hilarious spoof on 007 films.,"I love all of them, each film is hilarious and they change around what's funny in each film so as not to get old. If you like Mike Myers, you'll love this trio of spoofs on the 007 films."
4,"High, Low and Med","Ok, the first movie is a comedic masterpiece, witty and bawdy. Meaning the funniest parts are the dirtiest parts. The second movie thought, ""The dirtier, the funnier"" which, to me, was not the case. It got dirtier and less funny. The final movie, Goldmember got its act together a little. It had dirty parts and funny parts, but not together."
3,Picture quality & Delivery,"Picture quality is very good, but the case was broken when the item came to me.other than everything is good"
4,"Awesome price, awesome films....","I love these movies, I love them in Bluray, and I love getting all three for ten bucks more than you can imagine. I do NOT love the fact that the disc case broke into several plastic-y bits the very first time I opened it. However, this is my only discrepency. Great buy otherwise!"
5,Amazing Value for Mike Myers Greatest trilogy,Hilarious comedy brought to you by one of Canada's funniest comedians: Mike Myers!
2,"What? No ""Powers"" outtakes.","Unless I missed it, there are NO outtakes,gag reel,bloopers on any of the 3 dvd's. You would think New Line, Jay Roach,or Mike Myers would have thought to add this to this set. What a shame.!! I was really hoping for some outtakes."
5,"Best Psyllium product, hands down!","This stuff is AMAZING (when I can afford it). It blends with water smoothly and isn't gritty like the husk products. Keeps bowel movements spot on regular. This is an unbelievable fiber product and blows regular, cheaper psyllium out of the water."
5,The Killer & the Slain: A Stange Story by HUGH WALPOLE,I've always enjoyed the Hugh Walpole stories but this story was not of my liking nor did I find it to be anything close to what he used to write.His ghost stories are great though!
4,Best book of its kind.,"I've only moved ""off the shelf"" and into the blue this year, having used a sling since childhood. Had I read this book earlier I would have had many more years' experience by now. It covers a range of topics and is well illustrated. A good practical guide to the sport spiced with enough of the sort of chilling (sharks, line tangles, blackout) and inspiring (marlin hunters, jewfish hunted by sound alone, bluefin rocketing by at 50 mph) story-talk to captivate even my nondiving friends. I've read many of these stories out loud to hushed circles of friends. The comments on safety are reasonable and reflect a good respect for those who've lived a life in the water. A good job all round; I look forward to Terry's next."
5,Will the real Whitecross please stand up?,"Will the real Whitecross please stand up? This project breaks from the riff oriented rock of the band's past and creates a whole new sound for the band. It was recorded without guitarists Rex Carroll. I miss Rex a lot on this project, but it is still an excellent album. Scott Wenzel's vocals are there so it still sounds like Whitecross but the style changed. Without Rex Carroll the strong guitar riff oriented rock is not present as with past recordings. But what they created instead is a slightly more modern, less riff dominant rock sound that I enjoyed a great deal. I wish they had continued to create more projects that sounded like this one."
2,One Really Good Song,"White cross had a big and positive impact on me when I got saved as a teen. However, as genres change, this CD is dated. Plow me down is a really good song though."
3,Weaker Effort,"I felt that this CD was one of the weaker efforts by Whitecross. The sound is quite different from previous music done by this group and there are only a few good songs on this particular CD. Scott Wenzel is still leading the way on vocals, but that is about the only bright spot. For a ""new"" Whitecross fan, I would recommend any of the older material by Whitecross over this one. The true, die-hard Whitecross fan will still need to buy this to add to their collection, but it won't likely get played as often as the rest of their awesome tunes. This CD will likely be a slight letdown for fans of this hard-rocking group."
5,Very entertaining comedy,There is no comedian who brings out the truth like Carlos Mencia. This is a very entertaining DVD that will have you laughing the entire time.
4,A collection piece and nice sequel,"I bought this book because I owned ""Tricks for the Game Programming Gurus"" (the first one), which I like very much. I found this second one to be a must-have if you like the first one, but not as great. Still, there are many ""tricks"" that would be important for the game programmer in the 90's. Today, it's more for a curious reader, as it won't help with a new project. The book is mostly focused on DOS, but even DOS today won't work the same way, as hardware is entirely different."
5,This is as good as the written copy.,This is as good as the written copy and each time I read or listen to the audio book I find something new or a better understanding of the book. As I am collecting the entire Honor Harrington series in the MP3 format this was a missing book and it was well done by the reader.
5,Another home run for David Weber & Honor Harrington Series,Patrick O'Brian writes magnificent sea warfare tales ... David Weber is his counterpart in the oceans of space twenty centuries hence.My favorites are the books in the Honor Harrigton Series ... The Short Victorious War does NOT disappoint.Read this book (and all which preceeded it)!
4,I gave her this because of her talent,"I find her to be a very talented singer, and since I can't sample the rest of this album I feel it only fair to give her a better rating. I know one song on here is bad, and it's not the song itself because this is her testimony as she stands on the promises God made clear in the Holy Bible, and that's what I need to remember to do as well. However, the way she does this song it's not one of my favorite renditions. I hate songs in the keys of E&F. She does it in ""F"", and it's almost like a latin jazz style to it, and the choir echoing in the background ""Standing On The Promises Of God."" To be honest it didn't inspire me, and if anything it makes me feel rather depressed. As I said she does have a talented voice, and she does good work. I know her rendition of ""In The Presence Of Jehovah"" is masterful, so for one bad apple don't crucify her."
4,NICE DOCUMENTARY,"I purchased this one out of curiosity, it turned out to be very good. As a blues lover this is great to see a legend speak in his own words about himself, you see the serious side of him, and yes he has an excellent sense of humor. There are a lot of good interviews with people he knows, this man has got a lot of class. This is a two disc set, one is music the other the documentary, the music disc is of course great. But the documentary is the best I have seen for a while, but the sound quality on this is not the best. I would say overall this was a good find, and he is ninety four years old and just released a new album in May of 2008. He is one of a kind, blues lovers will enjoy this."
4,"Good product, reasonably priced","These paper towels are as good as any cheaper paper towels; they are not cloth-like or super thick, but they are as good as any other paper towels you might find for the same price that aren't made of recycled materials. In short, they are cheap and better for the environment than non-recycled, chlorine-bleached products."
1,A Great Disappointment,"I would have loved to praise a product that is manufactured tohelp the environment, but there is no substance to these paper towels. They melt away as soon as water hits them, so they are impractical to use."
1,Hate to bash anything green but...,"Whether or not these paper towels are made from recycled products or not, they are the worst pt I've ever used. I was only using them for drying hands at the sink and they weren't even sturdy enough for that. They practically disolve in your hands. Sorry guys but you have to put a little more paper in your paper towels."
1,Thin and runs out quickly!,These are thin and there are only a few sheets per roll. I highly recommend doing a search for recycled tissues on Amazon. I got a great price on Marcal recycled paper towels and they are great! Your best bet is to buy in bulk.
5,"my sides, they ache!!!","Got the game on Thursday. Organized a mini game night for Saturday (aka, last night). Laughed even through today.Do any of you KNOW how hard it is to A. hold something in your left hand that is larger than your fist, while B. putting a finger in one nostril as you yodel AND roll the die until you get three twos?!?!? All while fits of laughter make your body convulse as your vision gets blurred from all the tears (my dear husband even took a photo to prove it)!The next time we play (which will be soon) we will have more than just four players (although it played well with four, we can't imagine the craziness with more!!!).Thanks Matt, Robb, and Jeremy for this amazing new game!!!!"
4,Quelf is surprisingly fun for everyone.,"I took a chance on this game. I never heard of it. But, our family is always the type to give new games a chance. Honestly, it was the amazing illustration and design of the board and playing cards that caught my eye. These guys sure know how to make really great and fantastic illustrated characters!"
5,So much fun!,"This game is the most fun I've had in a while! We played on New Year's Eve, and had a blast doing it. The game is different each time you play!!! Good, all around, fun for adults! It's easy to follow, and you don't even have to pay attention that closely to have fun."
5,A video gamer's board game!,"I played this with my teenage sons and some of their friends one night. There were times when we were literally laughing until tears rolled down our faces!They were all skeptical at first about playing (since they enjoy video games and don't play board games much), but they decided to humor the old lady (me), and now they want to play it every weekend! With the number of cards in the Quelf game, there should be an infinite amount of playing possibilities.I strongly recommend this game. It's also great for kids who are a little shyer than their peers...draws them out in a safe environment."
5,What a voice!,"Dino's wonderful, and this captures him completely. Check out his live performance on the Ratpack Uncensored CD (not available here.. you gotta find it elsewhere)! What an entertainer. No one tops him."
4,NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART!,Never ever have I seen a tv mini-series with such unrelenting and unyielding hardship portrayed. It NEVER lets up from start to finish.....hardship and emotional distresses continue unabated throughout the entire movie. The weather is dark and foreboding (and give the program harsher nuances). Michael Kitchen is exceptional in his role as the land manager (Captain Townsend) who morally struggles (internally) over the plight of the tenants and his (enforcement) responsibilities as 'middle man' between an unmerciful land owner and the tenants. This is a one time watch only movie as it leaves you feeling mentally wiped out. Truley deserving of the BBC Award for its acurrate portrayel of hardships during a famine-ravaged Ireland (i.e. the potato famine) of the mid 1800's.
2,Good Historical Representation,"The film was, understandably, sad and gloomy. I wouldn't recommend it to everyone because of that. However, from a personal point of view I enjoyed it and the actors were good - especially Michael Kitchen - and the scenery was lovely."
1,I've Had Better,"Oh no. These condoms did not fulfill my fantasies at all! I would advise everyone not to buy these. The glowing was not helpful to my sexual drive or my boyfriend's since it only lasted a minute! My boyfriend also thought they were tacky, and said he would like me to get flavored ones next time. Oh well, I TRIED!"
2,No good,The light from the glowi-ness didn't help... MY boyfriend still missed the target. He stabbed me in the leg instead.
4,Amazon: Great resource for out-of-print books,"My mentor in my new hobby of cactus collecting lamented there just weren't that many New Mexico-specific cactus books. He was astonished and pleased when I gifted him with a copy of this old, old book, ""Cacti in New Mexico"" from 1911.The print quality is obviously from a scan of an original print, and as such it's not that great -- but this is what books looked like then, especially low-volume academic books such as this one. In any case, it was readable and I found it a useful resource in local cactus hunting & identifying."
4,Good Item,I like the Dockers shoe line and would recommend it to others. Looks great and feels great also. Thank you.
4,Comfortable Shoes,"I got these shoes quickly and without any problem or defects. They actually look ""dressier"" than the picture and go very well with docker style pants and even dressier blended pants. What was even more surprising was how comfortable they were right out of the box. I got these shoes a day before we left for Las Vegas and took them with us. I wore them while walking from our resort to several casinos and other resorts and they were extremely comfortable on the paved surfaces and the carpeted areas. I did walk on some small stretches of dirt and rocks and they were as I expected, NOT comfortable in that situation.Other than that one situation I found these to be good, comfortable shoes and the price is right too."
5,Great Shoes,"I like these shoes enough that I bought a second and a third pair. This time I ordered both the brown and the black versions. I find that all of Dockers products are vey well made and are great for casual or general business wear. These are made of good quality leather uppers. The soles are soft rubber so they don't make noise when walking on hard surfaces. My previous pair lasted through a year and a half of daily wear. The soles were the only thing that gave way to the constant wear. They didn't crack or break apart, just wore thin. Another plus is that these are comfortable right out of the box. No break-in period required."
4,4th Pair in 5 years,"Great Shoe because they are extremely comfortable AND they work in both casual and semi-formal situations, read tie, no tie.Also these shoes help my planters fasciitis without the expensive shoe insoles. Best of all these shoes have great traction for all terrain and floors.I wear these shoes everyday. These shoes last just over a year... which is good because I walk allot.One downside is they scuff easily."
2,Review of Dockers Shelter Toe Oxford,"Great looking shoe. However BEWARE, At least one full size small. 9 should be a 10. Also, very,very poor padding on the sole insert. We shall see about the wear (March 1,2012). Will report back...I Will not buy this brand again."
4,"I love these shoes, but the outsole (tread) doesn't last.","I can't find a more comfortable brown real leather shoe than this. My only complaint is that the outsole, or tread, wears relatively quickly to any other shoes I own. These tend to wear flat on the bottom after 6-8 months of use 3-4 days a week. I'm an IT guy and a good amount of my time is spent walking around smooth floors, I'm not sure why these wear as quickly as they do. Even with the wear issues on the tread, I can't find a shoe I like better and I'll be buying them again when they wear out."
5,"Good, Comfortable Casual Dress shoe","good comfortable shoe for work. I was very pleased with this product. I have to wear ""business casual"" with a tie at my work. These shoes are great for that type of dress code."
4,just what I wanted,"sizing was right, in one month's wear they feel right. note that they don't shine to a bright shine. I was able to wear them all day right out of the box."
2,"I thought you were more comfortable, are very hard for everyday use","Im a fan of dockers use most products but never had shoes but i thought very hard desilucione, i think i'ii keep usind HUSH puppies more soft"
3,"Comfortable, yet fragile","Ordered these shoes after I couldn't find a pair in my size in local stores. They are quite comfortable. However, they are also quite fragile. Within a week of wearing them (only to work where I sit at a desk) I already had a tear in the leather near the toes. I don't even really know how I got it, as I don't recall scuffing my toes against anything. Otherwise, a decent shoe."
3,Too small,"This shoes are nice but too small. If you're about to order one, I'd recomend you to chose 1 or 1/2 size bigger than your usual size."
5,Dockers Men's Oxfords,"The shoes are comfortable when I'm on my feet for hours at work. They're not high fashion, but they fulfill the prupose for which I ordered them."
3,Dockers Shelter Plain Toe Shoes,"I ordered these shoes because I had a previous pair of Dockers shoesthat were very similar and very comfortable, but I could no longerfind in the stores. Although these were made well, they were not nearlyas comfortable. I usually don't order wide shoes, but these did seem tobe more narrow than my last pair."
4,good shoe,"As others wrote, you should probably order 1/2 size larger. The leather is stiff but they will be fine after breaking them in. That is why I give them 4 instead of 5 stars."
2,Comfy but bad sole,"These are comfortable but by the time you get them wore in the sole of the shoe is all worn out. I work in an office too, its not like I was on concrete all day and im not over weight. They should make a sole that last longer than 2 months."
4,Dockers makes good shoes,This is the second time I have bought these shoes. They are not super refined looking but will still look good with a pair of khakis. Comfortable and worth every penny.
1,AVOID! Flimsiest soles ever.,"I've had mine for a barely a month, and I am extremely disappointed how quickly the soles have worn. The soles feel like they are made from the same materials as flip-flop soles. The soles on these have worn so quickly that I will probably only get about another 2 or 3 months out of them.I will NOT be buying Dockers again when I have to replace these, or ever again, for that matter. My shoes before this pair lasted me two years. This is unacceptable, Dockers! Customers expect much better quality for the higher price associate with your brand name."
2,"SOLES WEAR OUT QUICKLY, AVOID","The Dockers Men's Shelter Plain Toe Oxford is a comfortable and attractive shoe, but the soles wear very quickly. After only 3 weeks of occasional (3x a week) use INDOORS and (usually) on CARPET, the soles were visibly worn.Hoping to receive a refund from the seller, Shoebuy.com, proved pointless. When the shoes were returned to me, a form was included indicating that the ""soles are excessively worn"" which is nonsense. If the soles fade so quickly in a mere three weeks, they will be completely eroded in 6 months.In the Great Recession, giving money to a business or government means having parted with it forever regardless of the circumstances. Avoid this shoe and avoid Shoebuy.com unless you wish to get cheated."
5,Great Value,"While the rest of the television industry is focusing on High Definition and digital recivers Daewoo has offered an affordable alternative to those that don't plan on paying for the high definition signals and became skeptics when the television stations missed their goal to go completly digital (some time around 1999?). This model offers three component A/V inputs which is great for me since I had three RF adapters for my gaming systems ruining my television signal on my previous television. The sound isn't spectacular but you probably shouldn't plan on setting up a home theater with this 20"" television."
5,"High Quality, Low Price","This TV i have to say is a steal, concidering its low price this tv is well worth it. The screen has excellent picture and color. Also the one thing ive found handy are its many inputs. One in the front and 2 in the back along with S-video and Component video makes it super easy to hook multiple devices, i mean right now on mine ive got an Xbox, a Dvd player and a VCR all hooked up to it and it works great. i definatly recomend this tv to anyone that wants great quality for little money, specially if you guys are a broke student like me. Also i have to say this tv has been very dependable, ive had this one almost a year and it still work just as good as new."
4,"Best TV for the price and features, but...","I was looking for a 20"" flat screen TV that wasn't too much money with features like stereo sound and audio OUT RCA ports (to hook speakers to). Daewoo answered my prayers -- they are a quality name brand. This TV has audio out RCA ports like I wanted and even features simulated surround sound. The screen is very clear and bright. I ordered it off Amazon.com and expected to get it in a week -- it came the next day. Great.However, there was a small crack in the front upper right corner of the television case (not the screen). A little krazy glue to make sure it doesn't split any further and now there's nothing to worry about. The crack doesn't affect the performance quality of the TV by any means, but still, when you pay that much money for shipping you would want to receive it in top condition."
2,nice but...,Nice tv - but the packaging is very poor. The box came all banged up and the upper right hand corner is totally busted up on the tv. if you can get past the fact that the tv frame will be busted - the picture quality is quite good.
2,disappointed,"I saw this model in a store and was truly impressed with the picture quality, less so with the sound, but it seemed an excellent value.Out of the box, though, there was a large and obvious cosmetic flaw on the frame that leads me wonder about quality control (the top front corner of the frame had excess material, or may even have been crudely patched and sanded before painting; below that was either a large scratch or thin crack).Over-the-air performance (I don't have cable or dish) was ruined by excessive interference patterns on most channels, far more severe than the older GE which it was to replace, and vcr viewing also was problematic.This unit was probably a lemon, but based on the very obvious cosmetic flaws alone, it should never have been shipped from the factory."
4,"A light read, but thoroughly enjoyable!","I picked up this book from a discount bin in a bookstore on the boardwalk after I had accidentally left the books I had intended to read at home. I love the spirit of the 1920s, so I expected to enjoy the book at least a little, but I was very surprised. Just reviewing this book (which I read last year) makes me want to read it by the pool all over again. A serious drama it isn't, but it is fanciful and funny and most definitely worth the time."
5,Life Changing,I just bought More than a Dad the other day and I am so excited for my husband to start reading it. My neighbor's husband read More than a Dad and I have seen tremondous changes in his realtionships with his kids and his wife. When talking with my neighbor she says that this book was such a blessing to her entire family because they are all benefiting from the changes in her husband.
5,Great!,"Absolutely love book, and it is in good condition for us! Picked good condition-not acceptable. B/c what might be acceptable to you might mean something totally different to others. Will order again!"
5,Full of Practical Advise with a Dose of Humor,"I am not related to the author nor am I friends with him, but I am someone who greatly enjoyed this book. When I found out we were expecting twins I went out and bought several books on parenting. While almost all had some good nuggets of theory on parenting, this was my favorite in that it gave me practical advise on how to be a good father to my children and how to enjoy the time God has blessed me with them. Four years later I am having more fun with my girls than I ever imagined and I keep going back to this book to remind me to be intentional in how I approach my role as a dad (and most importantly, a husband to my wife). Thank you for this book!P.S. If the humor offends you, lighten up a little!"
3,Not so turbulent AIRCRAFT history,"I was disappointed in this book, primarily because I was expecting more information on commercial airlines, their history, problems, and development. There is only one 30 page chapter, ""Shake-up and Shakeout"", which really talks about airlines in any detail. The rest of the book concentrates on the history of aircraft and related technology as well as some limited information on the aerospace companies (Boeing, Lockheed, etc.) and personalities which produced the aircraft.The title, ""Turbulent Skies"", is a little more titillating than this basic historical rundown deserves and the subtitle which mentions ""Commercial Aviation"" may mislead some people.Content may be OK for those looking for aircraft development through history but look elsewhere if your interest is in the commercial airlines."
5,Outstanding history of aviation,"This book spends 350 pages in a very thorough history of commercial aviation. It is an excellent history of the early planes of commercial service. We have many histories of military aircraft and their use in war. This book goes into the early airliners like the DC 2 and DC 3. It tells the story of the magnificent DC 6. The Constellation story is told. All of this is fascinating history for me as I was long ago an aeronautical engineer. The modern period is well done up to the mid-90s and the great story of Southwest Airlines and the 737 will have to be found elsewhere. Still, this is excellent history, very readable and reliable."
2,Take the proverbial grain of salt,"The sad thing about the Dumbach/Newborn book is that it comes close. They actually interviewed non-Scholl persons for this book and engaged in serious investigative journalism. The result: Their book is not a rehash of the usual Scholl legend of the White Rose. For that, I am grateful.But it falls short. They take documents out of context, using letters written at one point in the lives of these children to prove philosophy when they are older. None of the facts (as far as I can tell) is actually wrong. It's just that they manipulated facts by omitting context to come up with the story they wanted to tell.If they had stuck closer to the interviews they were granted and pieced it all together with better attention to chronology, their book could have been as earthshattering as the original story. Instead, it disappears into the usual White Rose quagmire, adding to the confusion surrounding the tale."
3,it's good for beginners,"the information here is very top level. A lot of the book is spent discussing the historic importance of the musicians and not on the gear itself. I was hoping to see more technical information about the gear and why it technically makes tone X sound the way it does. This is a fun read, but not for serious tone tweakers."
2,Comprehensive but very hard,"Struggling with this book, it is anything but a book for beginners. Unless you are a god of linguistics or already know Sanskrit, probably better to start somewhere (anywhere) else. I will grant Coulson that - it is comprehensive..."
3,Obscenity,What a disgusting cover. Tasteless and obscure. I would recommend another edition or failing that take the photo of an indian diety and cover the book. Apalling bad taste.
1,Teach Yourself? Not a Chance.,"This appears to be an academic analysis of a language for the benefit of other academics, exhibiting both an academic's exhaustive knowledge of Sanskrit as well as his inability or reluctance to introduce a beginner to any understanding of the language at all. If mountains of English text comprised of sentences like the following:""Sanskrit grammarians discussed the cases of the noun in terms of the inflexional morphemes modifying the nominal stem.""is your idea of an effective way to lead a beginner to a working knowledge of anything, than by all means spend your hard-earned money on this block of pulp. The rest of us notice immediately that there is absolutely no thought to effective lesson planning, no thought to presenting the material in digestible chunks for the self-learner. It is a gross misrepresentation to include this title under the Teach Yourself label. The Teach Yourself Hindi series was so good I assumed this would be too. Bad assumption."
2,Says Book + CD's but there are no CD's,"Ordered this expecting a complete package and only received the book. So, I requested that what I ordered actually be sent. Guess what? They sent the EXACT same thing, book and no cd's. I have no idea what the quality of the entire program was because with just the book it was useless. Anyone want 2 books?"
1,Stopped working after 3 weeks!!!,"I bought the Avanti 1.7 cube refridgerator for my bedroom. The fridge only worked for 3 weeks and then the fan in the back just stopped working. THREE WEEKS! Avanti would not give me my money back or exchange my fridge for another one. This was a huge waste of money, I had to go out and spend another $80 because this horrible product worked for less than a month. I would NEVER recommend this fridge or this brand to anyone!!"
3,Is Watchers 3 For You,"While I found Watchers 3 to be intriguing, it also seemed sort of incomplete in that it raised more questions than it answered and it did not appear to identify the scriptures it claimed were being fulfilled to the events that it shows are happening today. I wanted to know exactly which scriptures Dr. Marzulli believes are being fulfilled the sightings of UFOs, UFO like objects and Alien activities taking place. What does it all mean? Where is it going? You're left hanging! Bottom line, it is worth renting and I enjoyed it. But I would have been sorely disappointed had I bought it!"
2,??,I didn't view this video. I thought this was a video revealing biblical prophesy. Don't believe in aliens visiting the earth..
1,Only 3 minutes in...,So I thought I would give it a shot and three minutes into the documentary they show an obviously doctored picture of two suns and then they head off to visit a solar expert who says they have only seen this twice in human history the first being Noah's flood and the second being the Exodus. And she's a scientist? Riiight! So much for this. You have to already be pretty caught up in the bible myth to accept any of the 'findings' in this pseudo-docuemtnary.
4,In spite of,"I tried to download this from Amazon and could not do it. I was told I needed to upgrade my connection speed with my provider, which I did and still could not download it. Amazon did refund my purchase price. I did view the product from a different source and really liked it."
3,good book but poor quality pictures,"My son likes the story. But the pictures in the book are not drawn clearly, they look like copied from TV sceen, low resolution."
5,Excellent!!,Well it was worth the wait!Although l'm in the UK l took a chance it would play on my multiregion player.. and didn't it just!!It's now available in Europe via Amazon.co.uk l believe and hopefully the double disc version will be available soon as l'll definately be purchasing this.. the one l have'll make a fine gift for a friend!!Rob. G
5,Pure Awesomeness,"If you are a fan of Alter Bridge then this DVD is a must have...The guys are simply at their best here and the film crew did an excellent job! I have fallen in love with the band all over again because of this DVD. The definate highlights is Myles' acoustic performance of ""Watch Over You"", the heart warming ""In Loving Memory"", and gut wrenching ""Blackbird""! These guys really know what it means to rock! I would absolutely recommend this DVD to anyone that appreciates a good band and good rock n' roll! Bring on AB III!!!"
3,Alterbridge Live,"Being a fan of AB from the start I was somewaht disappointed with the Live in Amsterdam release. Right out of the gate I noticed that the quality of the sound recording was not up to par for surround systems. It seemed to be recorded with no bottom and with way to much mids and highs. With the Amsterdam stage being a prime venue for recording live acts this concert is somewhat of a disappointment. Although Miles Kennedy does save the show with ""Watch Over You"" and ""Blackbird"" my overall consensus would be to label this effort as medicore. Don't get me wrong I love AB and have seen them live 2 different times, but this video did not compare to their past live performances."
2,Boring,"Boring. Plain and simple.The singer can sing. The band is talented. The dvd is boring. It's a generic 80's style concert. Very, very generic.Better dvd's include Led Zeppelin 2003, Rush Reno, Primus Hallucino Genetics, 311 New Orleans, Porcupine Tree Arriving Somewhere. Just for reverence."
5,Great live rock and roll!!!,"This DVD is absolutely AMAZING! Alter Bridge is one of the most underrated bands in rock and roll today. they have 2 great CDs out and they are incredible live! nothing beats actually seeing them, but this DVD captures the experience wonderfully. Myles Kennedy is a phenomenal singer, both studio and live, and a very underrated guitarist. Mark Tremonti, well, he's Mark Tremonti. he's fantastic. Brian Marshall and Scott ""Flip"" Phillips are great also, and round out, imho, the best rock band out there now. if you like a good rock and roll DVD this is what you're looking for. coming in 2010... ABIII AND MORE LIVE AB!! BRING IT ON!! :D"
5,Awesome show,This video gave me a new appreciation for Alter Bridge. Les Miles has a powerful voice that blends perfectly with Mark Tremonti's crushing guitar riffs and the band has a tremendous stage presence that is fun to watch. The sound production is outstanding and I long to see this band live for myself.
2,They really took a dump on this one!!!!,"I had the pleasure of meeting the band in Cleveland , Ohio when they played the House of Blues Blackbird release party and hoisting a few with the drummer. They were all very cordial and friendly and all gladly autographed a copy of Blackbird for my son (serving in Iraq.) Subsequently, I caught them two weeks or so later at an outdoor street festival in Hagarstown, MD and am a fan. I ordered Live In Amsterdam as soon as it was available for my son and I thought he was kidding when he said it was ""loungy"" and his fellow soldiers were making fun of it. Well, I finally saw it! What the hell were you guys and the record company thinking? If you don't want to be seriously taken as musicians, fine! There are plenty of thirteen year olds that will buy it! What's next Vegas? Damn am I disappointed! Harry"
4,Nice to own before the release in Turkey...,"I must thank Amazon once again for the great delivery, it's important for countries like ours to be have a safe shipment.No problem with the package, and it's nice to have the Dvd before the release in TURKEY.The recording is alive and well ... the reason i shot one star is that there's no bonus feature (documentary, official videos, ...)I recommended Dvd to all the fans and listeners who believe in Rock worldwide, so ALTER BRIDGE made the recording in Holland and one level up to be a worldwide band, not an usual american hero ;)Cheers bros."
3,Good but could have been better,this is actually not a bad live dvd but i was a bit disappointed since i saw them live and the dvd did not capture what i heard!! the sound mix could have been better. the visual is the visual.....nothing crazy there but overall OK!
2,Alter Bridge needs to Slow it Down,"Writing as a HUGE Alter Bridge fan, I was severely disappointed with this DVD. When I originally saw the setlist, I was very excited because I absolutely love all of those songs. Problem is, in order to fit 18 songs into 1:15, AB sped up every song by like 50 beats per minute, so every song is like a minute or so shorter. That kinda bothered me, cuz it was really hard to enjoy the songs at such a fast pace. They should have cut out 3 or 4 songs and kept everything at normal pace. Everything else is great though, sound quality, video quality, and the boys were at their best, just everything was too fast."
5,OUT OF THIS WORLD,They were out of this world. I thought their music was great but watching them is even better. Knowing I can watch it over & over again is the best part.
3,Mixed,The DVD looks great. But. Being an audio professional this is the most important. With that. The beginning is something to be desired. The mix is very week not alot of separation. When you get around 3 songs in it comes around and sounds great. It's a must by but the beginning should be remixed.
5,Epic Record,Alter Bridge Live DVD is the best live recording of 2010 and 2011!! Powerful hard rock music with hauting lyrics.....Myles Kenndy and Mark Tremonti performances are nothing less than spectacular!!! If Alter Bridge comes to your town...don't miss the show.... Add Blackbird and the new Alter Bridge III recordings to collection.
5,Alter Bridge Fan Must Have,Excellent! Watching it makes me wish I was their with them.Come to Canada soon guys!
5,Great DVD,This is a great DVD and I highly recommend to anyone. Alter Bridge puts on an excellent show.
5,ALTERBRIDGE ROCKS.,THIS IS A GREAT MUSIC DVD FROM A GREAT BAND AND A MUST FOR ANY ALTERBRIDGE FAN. MYLES KENNEDY HAS THE BEST ROCK VOICE IN THE WORLD TODAY. GET IT NOW.
1,Do not waste your time and monet,"Put simply, so not waste your time and money on this product. Worthless! Neither the desription or the actual functionality of this item are evn close to what a signal generator should be."
4,Not sure yet,"I haven't used this product long enough to give a fair review. So far, it is above average. On the box it doesn't say anything about using this product for your lip area. Dermalogica makes a product for just the lip area."
3,Good product,"I like the way the product feels, but I think it makes it a bit hard to apply. I'm never sure how much to use. It feels nice on but I have not been using it enough to see results."
2,The eye complex is better,"I order the complete age smart set. The Power Firm does not seem to absorb into my skin. The eye complex worked much better for me. I was hoping to relive some dark circles and sagging skin, but this product just didn't seem to live up to the expectation."
2,Tube half empty,"I don't know if this product works as I have been using it for a couple of days. It goes on smoothly, it's very creamy. That's all I can say right now.What I wanted to comment on is the amount of the product. It is half empty! I kept on squeezing and squeezing and only started to get product of out the tube when I've squeezed until the middle of the tube.This is a rip-off!"
5,Great product,I highly recommend this eye cream for every day use. It is silky smooth and has the greatest smell. It is one of my favorite products.
4,"Good,but not great","Great product for under eyes, however did not notice if it took any lines away. it feels good on my skin and I do not get a burning under my eyes like I do on other products."
4,Dermalogica Age Smart Power Firm,Love this product. Have tried other products from this lineand have found them to be consistent and my skins respondsnicely to them. Nice to find something that works for me.Will be a repeat customer. Thank you.
1,Allergic reaction,I got Contract Dermatitis from this product. Anyone with allergies should check with their dr. before using. I wound at the eye dr. after using it for 2 months.
4,smells and feels great,"I am not sure about long-term benefits (have used this product for a couple of weeks only), but it surely smells and feels great, and does not have any adverse effects."
3,Michelle - Long Island 6/11/10,"I just started using this product about 3 weeks ago, as of yet I have not seen any difference that is why I only gave it 3 stars. I love the smell of it & I like the way it feels when it goes on, but only time will tell if this product really works."
4,I think we have a winner,"I purchased Dermalogica AgeSmart Multivit. Power Firm for Eyes&Lips; based on other customer's postive reviews.I am pleased to report that this product works! I use it in the morning under makeup and at night before bed. It has significantly reduced the ""chicken skin"" under my eyes. It took around 2 weeks to notice a difference.It goes on so smooth it seems to magically disappear into your skin. Works well under foundation and leaves no grease.Thank you Dermalogica. I WILL be back."
4,Excellent for all skin care types,"I have used Dermologica Multivitamin Power Firm for Eye and Lip for several years. In the past, I experienced difficulty finding an under eye cream that would work well with my concealor, which I like to put on after the eye cream. Dermologica works the best with any type of concealor I have used and does not make it crack, flake, or rub off.I recognize it is a bit pricey for the small tube but a little goes a long way and tends to last me at least 2 months or more. I have tried other under eye products from Khiels, Origins, and Decelor to reduce dark circles, puffiness, and redness but I always go back to Dermologica. Hope this helps future buyers considering this product."
5,LOVE,This eye cream is amazing. I originally tried it from a sample and as soon as I did I knew I had to buy the full size. I've tried many eye creams over the years and this one actually tightened the eye area and reduced the appearance of some of my fine lines. It's so silky smooth. I realize it's pricey but it's one of those products that's worth it.
3,Good book on FDR's Espionage,"There are many other great reviews already about this book so I will just add a few comments that I do not see addressed anywhere else. Persico's numerous comments on FDR's great interest in geography are an important aspect few historians have considered when writing about FDR. Roosevelt had an excellent grasp of not only maps but geographical features of all parts of the world. This knowledge would suit him well during World War II in understanding troop movements in both Europe and the Pacific.However, as the other reviews have stated, the majority of this book could be gleaned from other histories on FDR. Specifically, David Reynolds's excellent ""From Munich to Pearl Harbor"". Overall though Persico's work is well researched and written. It is a great introduction for those who want to learn more about espionage and U.S. intelligence services during World War II."
3,Informative but uneven,"I learned a lot about the primordial eras of our universe and the physics involved from this slim book, but the book felt uneven.It seems like Professor Lidsey made a conscious effort to explain many of the concepts covered by the book through analogy. I got the feeling that perhaps this is how he lectures to undergraduates. Some of the analogies were apt and Lidsey explained them well. Others seemed ill-fitting and received very little explanation.The early part of the book seemed to go too slowly for me. I thought I might recommend it for readers who are even less familiar with basic physics and astronomy than I am. Later, I felt like the author was leaving me behind. Toward the end, the pace seemed just right.I couldn't discern a narrative flow in the book. I was often surprised from chapter to chapter (and sometimes page to page) where the author was headed.On the Skip It/Borrow It/Buy It scale, I give this a solid ""Borrow It""."
5,This is a good example of electonic music,"Todd Terry is quite good at putting together sounds, and you will especially like listening to this CD if you are just relaxing-but this isn't some little weird backwards jazz pop CD. I mean, this is a big cheese! Some songs go together with special parts that you really like, and other songs are just plain fun to listen to. My favorite song by far is Let it Ride, and listen to the sample. I think it just plays the lady voice part-but if you listen to this whole song, you get this supercalafragilisticexpialadosis collage of sounds, vocals, and sounds. LISTEN TO THIS CD!"
2,Change Is Good,"Lately, Todd Terry has been getting a lot of exposure mostly due to his newest album. Why? I have no idea. There was too much expectation here. Although there is the occasional ""good"" song, the CD lacks variety (big time), while it emphasizes on repetition(big time). You can notice the same break beat behind more than half of the songs. Do not buy.....borrow."
5,NOT BAD- NOT BAD AT ALL.,I really the beats. It's a good album to listen to. I belive Todd Terry has got something in this album that can accually go somewhere!
4,"Im rating single, not whole album","I heard the song ""Let It Ride"" on Trancemissions on WHFS and was sucked in. The song really is a basic drum and bass song but the lyrical sample in it memerized me. It was like nothing i'd heard before. It reminded me why I listen to techno in the first place."
1,Don't believe the hype,"This is unadulterated crap from an aging house dj trying to front industrial/jungle sensibility. The loops are simple. The samples are out of place and context. The MC's drip whack pretension. If you desire phenomenal drum'n'bass, check out WE ""The Square Root of Negative One""."
1,A fifteen dollar drink coaster,"The worst CD Ive bought in awhile. I went out on a limb with this one because of how much Ive been hearing about it in mags and things. Complete garbage. ""Balckout"" has such a simple DnB beat its almost comical, and its probally the best track."
3,Too much Stevia!!,"I am an avid stevia user, however this tea has a very distinct and bothersome taste. I won't call it an ""aftertaste"" because it's the first thing that hits you when you take a sip. The stevia is so pronounced, that I can't even comment on the overall taste. My 14 yo son (who is also a stevia user) doesn't like it because of the stevia taste. He commented on it the first time he tried it and I hadn't even said anything to him. On the positive side, I have been sleeping well since I started using this tea. I'm on my second of six boxes that I bought from Amazon, I want to like this tea, because it seems to be effective, but will keep looking for an alternative unless they cut back on the amount of stevia. I also ordered six boxes of the Yogi Skin-Detox tea at the same time and it's wonderful and effective. It also contains stevia, but doesn't have the ""aftertaste"" at all."
4,Helps..Tastes is ok,Im still experimenting with this. Seems like i need to use two tea bags but only drink the whole cup if i use two. This wont actually knock you but help you relax a little. Its no miracle cure but feel like its better than Celestial brand. Take some melatonin with it about a hour prior to your planned sleep time.
3,Don't SQUEEZE the teabag!,"First off, don't pay more than $3-$4 for this box. Kroger and some Walmarts carry this in their ""organic"" section.Secondly, the second time I used this I squeezed the teabag. I was in a catatonic state for 4-5 hours afterward. The best way I can describe this tea is that it WILL make you sleepy but doesn't put you to sleep. My best analogy would compare this with alcohol. Enough alcohol makes you drowsy but actually interferes with a restful sleep.BTW, valerian root acts on the same GABA receptors as Xanax, Ativan, and Klonipin.If you've been using this for a long period, ween yourself off ... don't stop taking this abrubtly."
1,Yogi Waketime Tea,"This tea does not work at all. I bought it considering the fact that it contains Valerian Root, which is the tea that aids sleep. Completely disappointed. Did not help me sleep at all after 2 weeks of taking it each night. It didn't even make me a little bit drowsy. If you want a good night's sleep without taking sleeping pills, take Valerian Root Tea. If your nearby food store does not have it (Whole Foods- been waiting for 3-4 months), then just get it online. Amazon has some really great prices. And yes, Valerian Root Tea Smells like straight up poop, but one bag knocked me out after 30 minutes and I suffer from MAJOR insomnia. Hope this helps. Do not get this tea!"
1,Taste like cough syrup!,"Taste like cough syrup! It's kind of sugary but has a very plastic and unnatural taste, and a slightly bittersweet after-taste.Wait, no, it's not exactly sweet. It's just slightly bitter. And leaves a very, very strange, chemical-like, unnatural sensation on your tongue... Yup, taste like cough syrup!"
1,Horrible stuff,"This is the polar opposite of Sleepytime tea. I had one cup last night, and I laid in bed and didn't fall asleep till well after midnight, and then kept waking up every few minutes after that. Worst sleep I have gotten in my entire life! I'm going back to Sleepytime tea. At least that stuff works."
4,knocks me out,"Maybe I'm imagining it, but this stuff seems to do what it promises. Tastes good, too, though a little sweet."
2,Best Yogi tea I have tried so far,"I bought 5 different varieties of Yogi tea and find that this blend is the most tolerable of the Yogi teas I have had so far. I don't care for the stevia at all, there is a taste that really turns me off and I believe it is the stevia but ... they use so many ingredients in their teas that it is hard to pinpoint the actual villian. We use stevia at home but it seems that stevia in processed products takes on a weirder flavour - to me anyways. I do not find that this tea relaxes me either but something in it feels like a stimulant. I will go back to my valerian, stinky but simple, clean and relaxing."
4,Try this when you need to relax.,"I was having trouble winding down at night, so I shopped around and found this Yogi Bedtime tea. I loved it right off the bat because it smelled so wonderful. I was surprised by the licorice flavor because it wasn't overpowering at all. It was ever so mild in the back of my throat. Overall, the flavor was delicate and smooth. Although this didn't help me fall asleep, it was still a good tea that helped me relax and calm down after a long day."
2,I'm sure it works if you can stomach it...,"I'm sorry to give this a poor review, but tea has to taste good in order for me to drink it. I often drink a large variety of bedtime teas and have never tasted any tea this awful. I can't speak for how well it works because I couldn't drink the whole cup even though I attempted to force myself. Yogi makes some good teas, but this I just couldn't stomach."
3,"Good tea, but not great","This tea is not a replacement for any sleep aid medication - this is much too weak to work as that. On the other hand, it is not a bad tasting tea and does not keep you awake either."
1,Simply Awfull!,"I've been trying various bedtime tea's & this one tastes horrible!! The first cup I tried I thought it was because i'd ate something just before drinking it & mabie that affected the taste, but I made myself another cup this evening at least 2 hrs. after eating & it was all I could do to finish it. I won't be drinking anymore Yogi tea, that's for sure!"
4,Good but tastes a bit medicinal,The tea works but sometimes I think that it causes me to have strange dreams.
5,Works great,"two bags is the way to go, sometimes I can't go to sleep and I need this product or else I will be rolling around from side to side :/"
4,great tea but too much stevia,"My 10 yr. old and I drink caffeine free tea every night. This one has more and seemingly better ingredients than our usual sleep time tea, but it is too heavy on the stevia leaf which leaves a very strong ""sweet & low"" type aftertaste.It does have very relaxing qualities and the flavor is great until the aftertaste of each sip. I am going to try using one bag of this and one bag of our usual sleep time tea to see if this helps because it really is a good tea if you are used to using artificial sweetners (as I am not) and want a healthier alternative. Half as much stevia and I would give it 5 stars."
5,Yogi is the best!!!,"I first tried this after a family member died and I inherited most of her pantry items. I am not a big fan of ""minty"" bedtime teas, but I gave this a try anyway since I had never tried the Yogi brand before. I am now hook! The flavor is so much better than your typical bedtime teas. The mint flavor is there, but not so overpowering. I really love this tea!"
5,"great tea, great price","much cheaper if you buy it in the six pack, helps me rest before bed time, i use it almost every nite"
1,Hate this tea,This tea tastes terrible. I was very disappointed. I would not recommend it to anyone. I am a tea drinker and always love the natural flavor of the tea and the soothing feeling you get after you drink it. This tea tastes more or less like over the counter cold medicine.
3,Works but I can't get over the taste.,"The valerian taste is a bit strong in this blend, it adds a odd sweetness. The few times that I did make a cup it did help lull me to sleep. But, I think I might stick with my other blends."
1,Not an easy read.,"Some books read like a brick, and then there is this book. To me it reads like a bowl of very dense mush. If you don't like to grapple with convoluted prose and repetitiveness, this book is not for you. I found the book to be an exercise in rough sledding and finally resorted to skimming. One can read only the all caps sentences and understand the points that Swedenborg is trying to make. However, he spends a lot of prose trying to make his points reasonable. Sorry, he did not convince me."
3,Mothers... Everyone's Got One,"My first Patrick White novel was Voss, which I found engaging from the beginning and haunting at the end. It took me longer to get into EOTS because there were so many players introduced, and there are flashbacks, and you don't know who the key players are half the time because PW is so descriptive... I had to re-read the beginning just to catch where the plot actually started to unfold. Once the story started to get moving towards the middle it was an enjoyable read to the end. I went back to re-read the beginning of the book and enjoyed it better the second time around.I understand Fred Schepisi is making this into a movie for 2011 and IMDB describes it as a 'Drama' - but I noticed quite a few elements of black humor throughout that really have me wondering if this isn't meant to be a comedy. We shall see."
5,Storm In a Teacup,Saw this film first on TV. It is a fun film if you like dogs. Has a fuuny scene with umteen dogs running amuck through a grand old English home.
4,Popular classic romance novel,"Knave of Diamonds By E.M.DellFast paced, involving romance written early in the Twentieth century.American Nap Errol is in love with reserved Englishwoman, Lady Anne. Lady Anne is unhappily married to an unpleasant, wealthy drunk, who is twice her age. Nap is, in his own and most other's opinion, a knave and a bounder.Lady Anne, miserable in her situation, is honor bound to her husband and marriage vows.This pleasant read has all the Romance ingredients: delirium tremens, madness, abduction, attempted forced seduction and finally, redemption and happiness for Nap and Anne.The English author's take on wealthy American invaders into English country society is also amusing. This novel stands up well to the test of time."
5,"Awesome Neutrogena eye cream,too bad it has discontinued.","This eye cream from Neutrogena is soft smooth and in a few days you can notice firmness around the eyes, I've been using it for a few years and love it! I will miss it immensity when I can no longer find it any where to buy."
3,Ehh...Not worth a second purchase...,"I bought this product, mainly to see if it would help with the bags under my eyes. I started using this product for several weeks and started seeing a VERY slight difference. Not only were the results minimal, I was having a few other problems with the product as well: first of all, it smells horrendous - those of you who have used it can not deny that - and second, after using the product every night (as directed) for a week, my eyes started burning, the skin around my eyes started burning. So I cut down the use to every other night. When that didn't work, I just stopped using it altogether for months. I still use it every now and then, just for the hell of it, but I will not be purchasing this product again."
4,To see the early nation in a different light,"I would have never picked up this book on my own to read, but because I recently joined a new book club, and this book was the pick for the month, I reluctantly began reading it. I never expected to like it, and I certainly never expected to make it through its 600 plus pages in just a few weeks.The book shows readers a different side of the life of one of our founding fathers, John Adams, as told through the eyes of his wife. While I have taught government classes and led discussions about the founding fathers, never have I read about them in such an intimate and personal way. This book shows us the John Adams that his wife Abagail, called Nabby, knew and loved. It gives a human face to one of the men often given superhuman qualities in historical texts about the early history of our nation and our founding fathers.I really enjoyed it, and you won't be disappointed."
2,"Not the same tea; cheaper, weaker","I have loved this tea for years. Now I find that the blend has changed: less organic ingredients, substitutions. The taste is weaker and the color has changed from clear yellow to reddish. And the box has gone from this interesting, colorful carton with lovely sayings to a cheap, thin, unattractive box that screams ""Made in India as cheaply as possible."" I'm looking for another Detox tea. Why mess with a great product?"
1,HORRIBLE,The taste is horrible and it make my tongue tingle. I couldn't drink the cup without it making my stomach hurt. I've given it several tries and just can't stomach it. Now I'm stuck with 6 boxes!
2,"Well, it works....","There is no doubt that this tea does it's job, but the smell of it is awful. I normally don't have any problems eating or drinking mildly offensive things, but I have such an aversion to the smell of this tea. It has a top note of moldy, dank earth with a base note of acrid peppers gone bad. The box says that it contains ""delicious sasparilla"". I don't taste anything like sasparilla or rootbeer in it at all. If you can bear the smell and aftertaste then go for it."
1,YUCK,"I ordered because of the great price....BUT yuck the stock is stale .Tastes like old iced ted left in the fridge toooo long.Not my first yogi tea flavor and not my first box of detox , so know it is not supposed to taste like this. Worst part that is the one I ordered the most of :} Others seem fine so far :}"
2,Licorice Root was a problem for me.,"When I read the reviews, before I purchased the tea, there was someone who stated-don't take if you have high blood pressure. I have a Thyroid issue, which brought on a high blood pressure issue. Both are under control with medication. I decided I'd try it anyway. I've been on it for 2 weeks, & unfortunately I have to stop drinking it. I was drinking 2 cups a day. I was starting to feel jittery-not a good feeling. After doing some research, the Licorice Root was the reason. Other than that, I liked the tea. It's not easy to find a detox tea without Licorice Root in it, unless you make your own. I did notice that Yogi's Berry Detox Tea doesn't have Licorice Root in it, so I will be trying that. So, please, if you have a Thyroid issue & or high blood pressure, don't drink this tea."
5,"Lovely flavor, after the first cup...","I had to choke down the first cup of this tea. It burned the back of my throat and made my tummy rumble a lot. But once I got used to the taste and how to drink it (not super hot and sipping slowly) I love it. It is definitely dehydrating and will make you pee alot, so be sure to drink lots of water, too.Drinking this daily at bedtime has been really beneficial to me. Even if it's just a placebo, I love it. In combination with lots of vitamins, exercise, and good nutrition, I'm seeing the weight come off a lot faster than before. I know it's probably water but hey, you gotta start somewhere!Highly recommend. Spicy, sweet without adding anything, like chai with a bit more licorice scent. Yummy."
3,Possible Cause of Dizziness,"I haven't quite determined that the Yogi DeTox is the cause, but since drinking it (three days how) I have had lots of dizziness. I am not going to drink it for a week to see if there is a relationship between it and my symptom. It has lots of ingredients - tastes wonderful - but it may be interacting with a medication I am on."
1,From great to gross...,This product used to be excellent. Recently its quality has gone way down and they changed the box...it makes no sense why they'd change their best tea like that.
1,tastes awful,"I took 3 sips of these tea, and I nearly gagged. I think it tastes spicy, like nutmeg. I can't stand the taste or smell of nutmeg, so I can't drink this tea. Just my two cents."
2,Delicious Tea But Be Careful!,"But if you have high blood pressure, skip it!! Even small amounts of black licorice root can raise your blood pressure to unhealthy levels. The licorice in the tea is only there to add sweetness."
4,Yogi Detox Tea,"I was recommended to drink this by a former American medic who had done a tour in Iraq. I'm not sure if I can even discern the level of effectiveness, but I seem to feel like I have flushed out some toxins, based on the lessening of some ill feeling I was experiencing before taking the month-long experiment of using it three times a day. All my study on the ingredients leads me to believe that I chose the best of the versions of a detoxifying drink. The price was right, too."
4,Yummy tea!,"This tea was very smooth and comforting. I usually don't go for anything licorice flavored, but found that this tea is a nice combo of chai flavors with some anise undertones. I think it would be more than tolerable to someone who hates black licorice like I do! I'm not sure if it actually detoxes, but after drinking it (with food) for about 3 days I started getting rid of water weight and felt more alert without being caffenated which is definitely a plus. I had a little more energy and my mood calmed a bit. I think it needs to be consumed for a longer period of time maybe 2 weeks or more in order to really feel results, but that's the basic principle when it comes to detoxing with any tea or diet foods. I only had 3 bags of it so obviously it would have benefitted me had I a few boxes of this stuff. Good tea!"
4,not necassary,"nice taste, if not a little strong. it does it's job well but it is not a detox that replaces fiber. it is more of a detox for your entire system. one thing to make note of is that it states not to use for more than one month at a time"
4,Very Good Deal,The product Rediscovering the Parables arrived as stated but in better condition than I had anticipated. The pages were crisp and the binding solid. The colors were still vibrant. It turned out to be a better deal than originally thought to be.
5,From tape 2 cloud...,"How enjoyable is this cd in the clouds? I have had Enchantment on a tape since it first came out! Such a fav I went looking for it when I got my kindle this last Christmas! Some tracks are especially enjoyable, others are 'nice'. What that means to me is that there are no clunkers that distract or make me want to skip or delete them-my highest praise! Overall listen is upbeat. Great background to keep you company!"
4,What I expected,"The skin is what I expected to protect my phone. Covers everything but the screen and the necessary holes for microphone, speakers and ports. The material is not as thick as other cases, but I assume the amount of transparency for legibility of the keys is a factor in how thick they can make it. Perhaps the thicknes could be listed in the specifications or features."
2,Product not what I expected,The product wasn't what I expected or envisioned. I don't use it. The full coverage of the buttons slows you down. The service from the vendor was fine.
5,A Great Read,"Although not strictly a book about either the Police or Sting the links to both are fairly obvious. Ian ""Coolbreeze"" Copeland's autobiography is well worth buying. His experiences of growing up in a (let's be honest) unusual family situation, of serving in Vietnam, his time as a road manager and the ups and downs of booking agency are all recounted and hold the interest consistently. There are two specific chapters on the Police - one on the early US tours and one on the Shea Stadium show - and many other references to them scattered throughout the book. Buy it - you will definitely enjoy it!"
5,We miss you Leroy!,"It's hard to review this book. I read it while The Police were in full Reunion Tour and old Police Fans were feeling the cruelty of Ian and Kim Turner precocious deaths.Ian was a force, he wasn't perfect and he knew it, but nontheless he tried to do his best.... and what best! Along with his brother Miles he created a new way of managing music and musicians, against all odds.The book alternates moments of fun, of tragedy, of description of the secrets behind the musical scenes.... hilarious scenes, along with Viet Nam tales.My perspective on music business has been confirmed by this great book. And now I'm sure The Police have always been 4: Sting, Stewart, Andy & Ian. Yes, Miles was obviously important: Ian was determinative.We miss you so much Leroy....."
5,Wonderful Series,"In the manner of ""Waiting for God"" this series is full of fun and good humor. Outrageous and so English in it's form and humor."
5,A tell it like it is book,This is excellent in that we had to take a good hard look at what we dreamed of doing in another part of the world..Yes the notion of living in Tuscany is very inviting..but if you are not a negotiator or have the patience to work on a project like buying or leasing from a foreign agent ..you will be very disappointed.. The book pointed out the paper work and the slow pace that they work at in Italy.. ANd we as Americanshave a tendency to demand results now..and it just doesn't work that way.If if you had a rich relative in Italy that left you a place. I would probably take years and several translators to get the job done..It opened out eyes to situations we had not been aware of..i am so glad we bought this book..Vry honest and down to earth..covers everything...
5,This book is great.,"Harlan Ellison is a credit to his species. This book contains a number of his short stories and essays were he attacks all that is evil in society. But beware this book will probably also offend many people. If you think gun control is simply a matter of using two hands or if believe that Jesus would not have wanted us to give up the Panama Canal then this book is likely to bother you. But that is what is so wonderful about Ellison, he makes you think. He invigorates the brain cells that atrophied from watching too many episodes of the Brady Bunch or Star search. Order this book immediately. ""God reads Harlan Ellison and so should you."""
2,"Shoddy production, shrill tone","Incredibly botched production job. And reading Ellison's rants is like being trapped in the living room with your cranky, crazy uncle. Go outside and play instead"
3,"OK, but Not Relevant Introduction to WWF","If you are looking for high-level concepts and architecture of Windows Workflow Foundation, then this book is good. However, many of the concepts and APIs featured in the book are not present in the current beta (2.0).Do not get this book if you are JUST looking for relevant code samples. Instead, visit http://msdn.microsoft.com/workflow. Get this book if you need to understand basic WWF concepts."
2,The only available book on windows workflow -- unfortunately,"The book presents Windows Workflow Foundation. It covers all aspects of this new framework, from using out-of-the-box activities to creating new ones or creating a new hosting environment.You should read this book for the high level information, not the code. The API in the newer versions of WWF has changed substantially and most of the code is obsolete.The biggest problem I have with this book is the quality (or lack thereof) of the English. The book is filled with spelling and grammatical errors.I would recommend waiting for a better book unless you need to know more about WWF immediately."
1,Full of Errors I would wait,"Well another VB.Net book without C# Examples, The back says Download Source code, well there is not code for this book. Who the heck proofs these books?The book start chapter 2 by saying that the goal is to be able to create an app or 2 that doesn't take much time.. OK I doubt that they tried to do this from only the instructions in the book. Do these guys speak English?Wait for a better Book on the subject this book will only confuse you!!"
3,Read the SDK,"Not a bad book, but not more helpful than the available MSDN resources, beta SDK & free hands on lab."
2,"Good overview, but has VB Code samples","Good overview of the beta framework. My fault however for assuming code samples would be in C# and was really annoyed to find the authors chose to go with the more verbose VB.Net. Not that I'm a C# fanatic, but VB.Net gets in the way when used in technical books: That's why you don't see it that often and it was really unexpected. (4 stars if C# had been used or publisher would have added disclaimer to cover: ""Warning: Code samples in VB.Net"")"
5,Great introduction to chess,"This is a great introduction to chess for my first grader. The instructions allow you to break down the individual type of moves per type of chess piece. This has proved very helpful for my first grader, who found it too confusing before this was available to her. I highly recommend this for the beginner."
4,Cute and funny,"Cute and funny...i actually laughed out loud quite a few times. Very clever, and something different from the norm. I enjoyed it and would recommend it to all Big Girls."
4,4 1/2 stars.,"a gloriously fun read this was. jean-patrick manchette is a gas. ""3 to kill"" is a fresh, startling crime novel, completely free of cliche. georges gerfaut, the main character, is quite unlike any other creation i have encountered in a thriller. i finished this book in one evening, and immediately purchased another manchette book, ""the prone gunman."" highly recommended to fans of noir fiction."
1,undelivered item,I was not able to receive the item because UPS (the only shipping option) did not want to deliver the item at the door.Too bad they hurt your business.I hope you get other shipping options. your prices and speed of transaction make your item very attractive.
5,Infallible Proof of The word of God!!!,"This Book proves that the KJV of the Bible is the inspired word of God! there are over 2000 examples taken right from the KJV. Every single example shows you where to look it up in the Good book. I've looked up almost every example, and there is not one error pertaining to the examples found in this book. everything counts out perfectly. Even in the Greek N.T. you can count the words and letters and they come out the same. I could go on and on about how amazing this book is but until you read it, and look up the examples you will never know what I'm talking about.All for God's glory through his Son Jesus.Frank Weir"
5,Another Great Read,This book is a continuation from Desert Son. I highly recommend you read this book but first you might want to read Desert Sons. Mark does a wonderful job of having you look at both Ryan and Scotts lives. Both of these books are worth the price you pay for them. Read both of them trust me you will enjoy it. I am looking forward to reading more of Mark Kendricks novels.
5,A sequel??? Are you sure??,"OMG!!!!!! That isthe best way to describe ""desert sons"" and ""into this world we're thrown"". These are two of the best books i've ever read. ""Into this world we're thrown"" is not quite as good as desert sons, but that most definitely does not mean it is a disappointment or anything of the sort. It is wonderfully written and deals with ryan's and scotts' personalities changing from what they were in desert sons. the author does a great job with the shift in character and introducing new obstacles for the two to overcome. I sure hope he comes up with some more gems like these two books, but until then i shall have to read these two again :)"
5,The Desert Sons Return!,"I loved Mark Kendrick's debut novel, Desert Sons. ... I was surprised and happy to learn of his plans to first write a sequel to Desert Sons. Though I found the ending of the original completely satisfying, it also left some open possibilities that this book explores.While Desert Sons deftly handles the difficult and sometimes dangerous coming out process of young lovers Ryan and Scott, the sequel finds that lingering tensions remain, while new challenges continue to surface. Infidelity, jealousy, town gossip, and buried feelings threaten to destroy their relationship. Worse yet, the threat of violence looms constantly in their lives.Fans of Desert Sons will surely cherish this conclusion to its story-lines. However, I also suggest it to fans of gay teen ""coming out"" movies like Beautiful Thing, Get Real, Boy's Life, and Edge of Seventeen. In fact, Kendrick's first two novels would both make great movies themselves!"
3,Does what the description says...,"I own a 2011 Prius, it is sturdy enough for one mountain bike, I would not recommend to two and I fear that the clips at the end of this rack might be bending my frame, I use it for small distances thus it works fine. I would recommend getting another Rack especially for a Prius."
2,Straps for bike frame are useless,"After putting the unit on my 00 Toyota Solara for the first time and after placing my bike into the cradle, I proceeded to strap the bike's frame. Naturally one would want to fasten this securely. The plastic piece that the threading loops through immediately snapped. I put reasonable pressure on the thread as I pulled it through. This raises serious red flags on the integrity of this product over all. I'm going to attempt rigging it with bungee cable to see if I can create a much safer and secure method for transporting my bikes.Just be aware that these cables are useless. If it doesn't break when you get your bike secured in the cradle, then when? On the freeway, putting peoples lives at risk?"
4,Works well with Mountain Bikes,I purchased this for a 2003 Pontiac Grand Prix. It works well and is sturdy enough to support two 25lbs mountain-style bikes.
5,BEST BIKE RACK HANDS DOWN FOR THE MONEY!,"You will not find a better bike rack for this low of a price.You can even find this item at times for less than 30 dollars.The Allen mt and deluxe 100 series are all the same, save for the individual bike clamps.Strip the clamps off and you can shove more than 2-4 bikes on, depending on type of bike,.They still sell a version without the clamps; rarely.If you are looking for a non locking, well built, very dependably sturdy bike rack then this is it, look no further.I own 2 of them at present both over 10+ years old, used hundreds of times and they are still in mint condition.PS: I also have used mine to dangle multiple gear bags and items off of to be hauled from basecamp to mobile camps, etc, etc,; these racks are hard core!"
1,Gave out on second use,"This bike rack gave out the second time I used it. The first time it was used it was easy to put together and felt solid. The second time I used it one of the buckles (plastic) gave out. The teeth of the buckle stopped holding the strap (one of the top two) and the bike swung free while I was driving down the highway. I had to quickly pull over before the whole bike fell off the back of the car.Side note: My car is on the fit list for the bike rack. I followed the instructions for securing it to the car carefully and my bike is within the weight limits. The plastic buckle simply gave out. A work around would be to just tie a knot since I can't trust the buckle but, after nearly causing an accident on the highway after just the second use, I don't trust it anymore."
4,Good rack--recommended,"One of my considerations when shopping for a rack was the low quality of many consumer products. Failure of this kind of product could be disastrous.Turns out that this rack is very well built. All critical parts are made of real METAL.If there is anything to complain about, it is the reliance on elastic portions of lower straps to hold bottom of rack firmly against car and a couple of the less critical buckles and fittings are plastic.Overall, the rack is very roadworthy."
5,Used on Mini Cooper,I needed a bike carrier for my Mini Cooper and quickly found that most of the options were going to cost me hundreds of dollars to add on the car. This carrier is one of the few alternatives for the Mini and it works GREAT!! The carrier stays solid on the car and there is no sway to it at all. I have only carried one bike but I would feel comfortable putting a second one on with no trouble. Just a note if you have a Mini Cooper convertable this carrier will not be compatible.
2,Buy it cheaper in walmart,It is cheaper at walmart. They also have a promotion going on right now for the same item.Not sure if the comment will be removed though.
1,Factory Screw Up?,"I bought this bike rack as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend and decided to spend the extra bucks to get him a better quality one than he had previously. When he opened it and tried to attach it to the car, it was completely put together wrong and didn't even resemble the picture on the box. Luckily he is handy and is going to take it apart and put it together properly. What a disappointment when we wanted to go for our first trek of the spring and had this to deal with beforehand. I don't know what went wrong, but the assembly person must have been stoned."
5,Sturdy and Lightweight,"This is my first bicycle rack and it's exactly what I had in mind. It's small, lightweight, and holds my bike (54cm BMC SL01) perfectly. The actual grips that the bike rests on rotate slightly to adjust to the frame, which is great, because my bike frame is a bit unusual underneath the seat post (see:[...]l). I actually have to set the rack very off center because of that extra bar in the frame, to keep the bike from sticking out, but it still works out well.My drop down handlebars rest on the rack perfectly, keeping the front tire from turning and hitting my car, and overall the bike rests completely away from the body of my car (I recommend keeping the pedals in a 6 o'clock 12 o'clock position).If you want a no hassle, small bike rack the does the trick and looks great leaving it on, I totally advise you to get this rack. Perfect for my '05 Civic."
4,Works Great,"I purchased this for my 2008 Nissan Altima, and it fits fine. The bottom clips can hook under the car like in the picture, or on the bottom of the trunk lid. My only concerns are that the metal clips seem to be chipping away the paint (nothing a little pipe insulator can't fix) and the straps are extremely long (to fit SUVs) so I have to tie several knots/bows to keep them from flapping. Holds both bikes without problems, and even if my front bike wheel turns a lot while driving, it doesn't hurt my car."
4,A good Choice for a compact bike trunk mount rack,"I am very happy with this product. Although I haven't taken a long trip with it yet, I have found it to be quite sturdy on short trips. After the initial setup, it can be put on or removed in less than a minute, facilitated by cam buckles. Bike attachment point are sturdy. Probably the best feature for me is that this rack folds flat for easy storage in the car trunk, so it's always ready.I think this is the best bike rack for the price. I have had bulkier and cheaper models and experienced a variety of problems."
3,Is it secure on a CRV?,"Although the web site and box say this rack is compatible with the new Honda CRV, it is questionable. The top hooks will not lay flat and are hard to get into a secure position. The only place to put the bottom hooks is under the plastic skin on the bottom of the rear door, and the instructions say they should be hooked onto sheet metal. We have driven about 4 hours with the rack on the CRV, and the bottom straps tend to come loose due to vibrations, making me feel a little insecure about the security of our bikes on this rack. It is nice and compact and folds up flat, and it is inexpensive, but I would look for a different rack for a CRV."
2,part broke but company fixed it right away,"I am very unhappy with the product. It broke the first time I used it. I put it on the car, loaded the bike and then traveled 25 miles. The bike was secure, but that was not the problem. When I got home and started taking the rack off the release on the top strap clamp broke. The only way that I could get it off was to undo all the other straps and then slide the strap off after the others were loose. I am going to contact the company and hopefully they will send me a replacement part. The company promptly sent me a replacement part for the broken clasp. Great service and hopefully this one will not break."
5,The Best Bike Accessory,I bought this rack in May and I've used it non-stop since then. The rack is easy to install. The straps tighten down effortlessly. The rack has large foam pads at each touch point so there's no damage to the trunk.
3,Allen 102S,This bike rack does exactly what it is supposed to do without any flare. is fairly easy to manipulate and folds nice and flat when not in use
4,Sits a little low on 98 Buick Regal.,It put this on my P.O.S. Buick Regal. It works but the angle is a straight out and not up like the picture so I only have about a 5 to 6 inch clearance from the bike tire to the ground.
4,I like this rack,"Very easy to put on and take off. No need to leave it on the car when I go bike riding, just stash it in the trunk. Holds two heavy mountain bikes, but seems happier with just one. I've driven at highway speeds and over bumpy dirt roads, and the bikes stay put with minimal swaying. I recommend the velcro straps to keep the wheels straight. An added bonus: I can use the rack (on the car) as a bike stand to adjust the derailleurs and perform minor maintenance on the bikes. I suppose you can do that with most racks..."
4,Great bike rack,I took a chance without really knowing if this would work on the primary car I would need it for. I'm using it on an 89 mx6 and it works great. I only travel a few miles to my riding trails but it feels like it would go a lot farther distances without issue. It would be nice to have easier access to the car models it works with. This unit is a pretty easy to set up. I can put it on a matter of minutes and break it down even quicker. I have noticed though I've picked up a few dings that weren't there before. Not sure what's causing it but i guess it's going to happen. Overall good product.
3,Only fits larger bikes ...,"Ordered the rack, got it, sturdy, took less than 10 minutes to install.However, the width of the bars is not adjustable, so the rack is only good for larger bikes (above 17.5 inch). I have a Trek 7.3FX bike which fits on the rack, but my wife has a Trek 7100 which would not fit, no matter what. Also, the website doesn't mention the cars it will or will not fit, this information is available once you get the rack. There is a fit guide on the back of the box. So it fit my wife's Camry, but wouldn't fit my Celica. Would be nice to have this information BEFORE one orders. Had to return mine. 5 stars for Amazon though, they gave me a full refund."
2,Returned - did not fit correctly,"Even though the manufacturer's website states that the bike rack would fit my 2002 Volvo C70, it rubbed against the rear spoiler. I chose to return it rather than risk damaging my car. Amazon's return center was gracious and extremely helpful in making sure that I was satisfied."
3,Great Product but only for bigger bikes,"After doing tons of research on trunk mountable bike racks it came down to this unit and the bones rack. I pick this one because it just came across as more sturdier solution. When i mounted it to my car it was a VERY EASY installation and was sturdy enough that if i tried to move it, it shook the entire car! I was elated to say the least. However, this didn't last long. if you have a bike that a 16 inch frame or smaller this rack is not for you. Your bike will not fit on the mounts and the poles on the unit are not adjustable. In the end i had to return it and go with the bones rack. I rate this product as three stars because it is actually a nice bike rack. But it is not an all encompassing design and the manf does not explicitly tell you what bike frames will or will not fit on this rack."
4,Good product,I was looking for sturdy bike mount to be used within the city limits. I have used it twice so far and it has done the job pretty well.
3,Does the job,"I needed a bike rack compatible with the spoiler on my honda accord and this does the job. Because I'm concerned about the slightest scratches on my paint I still drape a towel over the spoiler first. I like the rack, but was disappointed that it was wider than the inside width of my bike rods (Trek 7400). Although, I found I can get the bike mounted by placing the one side of the rack infront of the back tire, under the rear rods to the back wheels. It's not a perfect fit in the bike grips, but works for now."
4,Birthday,This went for my son's birthday. He will make use of it traveling to various local bike trails. Thanks f
3,Too short unless you are a collector,"I love Dredg. They are one of today's greatest working bands. They deserve a larger audience. But this video is obviously for promoting ""Catch Without Arms"" in record stores. It is only 29 minutes long, and all the songs are from ""Catch..."". And honestly, the mixes on this DVD are a little vocal heavy. They lack punch. This is not a concert video in the traditional sense. It is footage of a few songs from a concert, not an entire concert by any means. This video is for a die-hard collector. I wouldn't pay anything more than $10 for this DVD if I knew better.BTW, Amazon has 2 listings for this DVD with slightly different titles but with big price differences. Research before purchase."
5,Delicious candy!,"These candies are fantastic. I think the name mints is deceiving as they do not have any mint flavor. They have a sweet, subtle lemon flavor. I have a child with food allergies (one being cane sugar) so finding suitable candy is difficult. These candies fit the bill and are so good that the whole family loves them!"
4,Fred rules!,A great post-Psychic TV effort from Fred Gianelli. It's not a masterpiece but there's a couple cuts on this that are priceless and timelessly dreamy....
5,Two Hotties,"Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt gave an excellent performance in Interview with a Vampire. They are two of the best actors of today, the way they expressed the emotions of this 5 star film gave me chills. I recommend that you own this film and add it to the most wanted in the romatic/horror/drama films of the '90s."
2,Needs a blood transfusion. Or something.,"I liked this movie rather well when I was younger, but after watching it again recently, I found it almost intolerable. I don't know why I ever thought Tom Cruise as a pompous, nihilistic vampire was worth watching, because he's not. He's just TOO Tom Cruise to stand, and all the makeup and poncy clothing in the world can't change his mannerisms and facial expressions.This movie takes itself much too seriously, and all the manufactured angst and darkness reminds one of the public access Floridian goths on SNL.Honestly, Brad Pitt's acting was pretty okay, but any redemption to be found in his performance (as far as the film goes, overall) is eclipsed by the wretchedness of the rest of the production.I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, save teenagers who perhaps are still impressed by this kind of thing."
3,It was great...till I read the book!,"This movie is still on my top 10 list of favorite vampire movies, but it pales in comparison to the book. Once I read the book, too many things didn't make sense. Why did the director take so many liberties? What's wrong with making a longer movie? This isn't a bad movie, but I beg of all of you - PLEASE read the book! And get someone else to play Lestat if you do any more of the books."
4,finally got it,"my fiance was looking for that movie everywhere. stores video but no one seemed to have it!! so i just decided to order it on amazon which i was really glad to see here but anyways, fats shippping, factory sealed, brand new but i really dont like the cover. its made out of carton"
5,Great movie from the 1990's,This movie is a pretty good vampire movie. Even though it was from the 90's I think they did a good job with it. Brad Pitt did an awesome job as Louis and Tom Cruise did decently with his role as Lestat. Kirsten Dunst was an adorable Claudia and Antonio Banderas was a clever Armand.
4,"""Kill them swiftly if you will""!!!!!!!!","I loved that movie especially when Lestat goes ""Kill them swiftly if you will, but do it, For do not doubt you are a killer Louie"". I know you all probably saw the movie too but, I just love that part. What can I say when you have Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise on one screen together you can't lose with 2 men as beautiful as they are."
2,Blu-ray is BAD!,"This review is for the quality of the Blu-ray only, and it is worthless. Sound quality is so bad you have to turn it UP all the way to even hear the dialog. And the movie is so dark that you can't notice any difference in the Blu-ray HD effect. If you already have the DVD don't waste your money on the Blu-ray. It's a joke."
4,great HD video transfer but the audio quality...,"one of all time fav vampire movies of all time!! i found this for $8 on Blu-ray and decided to get it and replace the DVD counterpart. first off Warner Bros did an excellent job with the HD transfer (as they always do) the film isn't nearly as grainy as the DVD is but here is where WB failed which is with the audio. the DVD counterpart offers both English Dolby Digital 5.1 & DTS 5.1 audio tracks however, with the Blu-ray for some reason all you get is a standard English Dolby Digital 5.1 audio track. no DTS-HD or even a Dolby TrueHD audio track. why did they not take advantage of Blu-ray's full potential with this film? if you already own the DVD counterpart and are considering replacing it with Blu-ray you'll have to ask yourself ""do i wanna give up having a DTS audio track in favor of HD video, or just deal with having video quality that is slightly grainier in favor of having a higher quality audio?"" the choice is really up you in the end"
5,best movie ever,I have seen this movie at least 30 times since it came out. It is the best movie ever. With those two hunks wow.
4,Not quite the same...,"Spectacular movie!I am very much a fan of Anne Rice's books, particularly the Vampire Chronicles. Though the movie does not quite match parts of the story, it does very well to compensate for parts left out. I never expect a movie based on a book to be the same. The choice of actors for the parts are absolutely wonderful. Even if you are not a fan of either Cruise or Pitt, their normal personas are completely clouded with Rice's characters.Again, well worth the watch."
5,Cruise and Pitt surpised me....,"...REALLY surprised me. I didn't think they could pull it off...But that aside, this was one awesome movie! It sheds a wonderfully unique light on vampires (there are no main mortal characters, btw), and the main characters struggle with the morality of killing and his ever fleeting humanity. Specifically on the movie, special effects, music, sets, costuming- all fine, and it wasn't a bad adaption of the book either.This may seem annoying or trivial, but I feel I have to retribute to two flaming reviews this movie was given. 1)If you have any idea what a German accent sounds like, you'll realize that none of the characters speak like that, and 2)Interview with the Vampire isn't really a ""horror"" film or a normal vampire flick, it's about the vampires themselves, and how they live caught between humainty and blood lust. Okay, I had to get that out."
5,See this movie,"A great Vampire story-Great time periods, cast/characters-perfect, visuals-awesome, this is also a movie you can watch more than once or twice. I would say 15 and older. Not gory, just really cool movie."
4,Good movie,"I got this movie, and it was your typical vampire presentation, the bloodsucking, the gruesome transformations from mortal to dark child ect, ect. People it's just a movie dont go into a whole phylisophical explaination of it. FOR CRYING OUT LOUD I reinterate it's JUST a movie. A good movie, a very sliq and sexy rendition, but a movie, a movie made in Hollywood the land of Fantasy, so just chill enjoy it and take it for what it is, and stop making it more than what it is. Go get sum popcorn pop in this Vamps thriller and enjoy."
3,"Beautifully done, but wooden acting","This film looks gorgeous --great locations, sets and costumes-- but I wanted to giggle whenever Cruise & Pitt tried to be dramatic (Antonio Banderas was OK.) Kirsten Dunst was great, though -- near the end, my husband asked how old the actress was (I don't think he believed she was a little girl in real life.) See it for her, and the scenery."
5,Best vampire movie i have ever seen.,"I saw the movie before i bought the book. And without knowing anything about it, I expected the usuall ""stake in the heart story"". But I got totally amazed of how wonderfull this movie was.It was the first one I've ever seen where you got the story from the vampires point of wiew.Do I have to tell you that in a month I had bought all the books in the chronicles.I think Tom Cruise and Kirsten Dunst were brilliant as Lestat and Claudia."
1,Bad movie.,"Interesting concept, bad execution. Not recomended. There are better films out there about vampires. Not a good film."
1,FUTILE MOVIE,"thismovie is so boring, the script so ridiculous and weak, that it is a shame to the vampire's legends all around the world. THe characters are bad, the actors are obvioulsy sleeping."
1,Rip Off!,"""Like new"" was actually ""like garbage."" It wasn't worth the few bucks it took to purchase. The DVD is scratched up as though someone rubbed it on a cement block. This is the worse product I have purchased through Amazon unfortunately. I will NOT be purchasing products from this vender EVER again."
1,Don't waste your time,"This has to be one of the silliest movies I've ever watched. It's about a vampire who doesn't like killing people. Also, he doesn't get along with his fellow vampires very well. There's no real plot. A complete waste of time, money, and talent."
4,Good intense thriller,"There is no ""down time"" in this one! The characters drive the mood and suspence... and not the gore and violence."
3,Meh,"My husband told me i needed to watch it, so i rented it, the movie is okay...the quality was good though."
4,Vampire,Good 90's movie with Cruise and Pitt. A great Vampire story before the Twilight crazy of the late 2000's. Definitely a good buy.
3,I was hoping for better,"I made the worst mistake, I read the book before I saw the movie so the whole time I was thinking ""Hey that's not how it was in the book."" I still liked the movie but I was really hoping for better, I know they can't make the movie exactly like the book or it would get too long and too boring in some spots but well you know. I still watch it everytime it is on."
4,I found it seductive and thrilling at the same time.,"This movie is great for young children just getting into thriller/horror movies. It is not to goulish as some, but just enough to get you intriqued. This movie just for me started out reading the book for my 11th grade English class and later saw the movie with my dad. This movie and a friend got me more into Anne Rice novels. If you love vampires and witches you should read her novels and see this movie. It portrays the romance between vampires and their human victims."
2,Poor Blu-Ray transfer,"First off as a film, I would give it 4 1/2 stars.If you own the standard DVD save your money. Almost no difference in picture quality."
4,A required introduction to the new breed of vampire,"A compilation of Anne Rice's Vampire series, written by Rice herself. The Vampire, Louis [Brad Pitt] tells the story of his life as a vampire, his companion and nemesis LeStat [Tom Cruise], and their daughter Claudia [Kirsten Dunst], spanning over two centuries in just two hours in a surprisingly coherent way that captures much of the spirit of the original books. An excellent film and an excellent introduction to the new breed of vampire, who is no longer seen as evil incarnate but a breed similar but different from humans, with their own moral code, who love and hate, who have only a few of the weaknesses of the old school vampires like Count Dracula. Definitely required watching to understand the history of vampire movies. You can read more about Interview and other horror movies in our movie wiki at channel-kdk12."
2,Gag me with a lacy spoon,"""Oh, we're so Goth! Oh, we're so tragic! Love us! hate us! Fear us!""My summary in a nutshell of IwaV. I had the misfortune of reading Anne Rice's novel before seeing this film, so I had an idea what was coming. Both Cruise and Pitt are horribly HORRIBLY miscast in their respective roles. Bandares is always a treat onscreen, and even *he* sucks as a vampire (no pun intended).Short, short version: not worth it. Really."
1,dreadfully dull,"This was a huge disappointment. A talented cast (except for Tom Cruise) is largely wasted. Pitt pouts, Cruise drones on and on about nothing, and the film is unendingly slow, especially in the scenes between Cruise and Pitt. Even the homoerotic element in the novel is played down for ridiculous playboy-style playmate video effect--lots of half-closed eyes and sighing. Out and out terrible."
2,weird movie,"Trying to understand why this movie is/was so popular... must be just the Cruise/Pitt/Banderas factor? If you're looking for vampires different from Twilight, I guess this might be for you."
2,"""And all the vampires...",".. walking in the streets. Gonna glide down, over Mulholland, gonna freefall, out in the nothing, gonna leave this world for a while...""- T. Petty, the song Freefallin' from 1987.Interview With A Vampire is lavish and viscerally entertaining - with a strong Cruise - but also self-indulgent and dragging at times, with a misplaced Pitt (too much pin-up boy despite immense acting qualities). The set design is a triumph - bringing Blade Runner (1982) to mind in vastness.The ending is ambivalant - it finally ends, the movie has dragged for a while at this point - yet watching Cruise demonically laughing and pumped up - showing an edge we would only later see him display in the gem Magnolia (2000) - to the raunching tunes of Guns N' Roses' original and splendid cover of the old Stones song Sympathy For The Devil - feels like the opening to a great vampire/horror flick. But it was the ending. Alas.Two out of five stars."
5,Great,I read this book and have seen this movie many times and I can sincerely tell you they did an incredible job with this thing. It is completely memorable. Her book was amazing and I thought I would be disappointed with this but its pretty good. Cruise plays an awesome Lestat. Enjoy.
4,Great Movie but.....,"This was a great movie but it's missing a lot of key elements from the book. It's been a while since I've read the book so one of the only things I can remember is that when Lestat turns Louis in the movie it was Fast and on the docks. In the book Louis was dying from some sort of sickness. Lestat showed up in his room and asked ""I can make it all go away."" Lestat planned it out because he watched Louis and knew that he'd have a safe place to stay during the night if he turned Louis into a creature of the night. One other was when they got the Nanny in the movie she died within 1 or 2 nights. In the book it was like 1 or 2 weeks. All in all it's a good movie. But it lacks the intense story of the book."
5,great tom cruise movie,This is one of my all time favorite movies. Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt are at their best in this one.
2,Great Movie - Blu-ray is a waste of money.,"If you are considering buying this wonderful film adaptation of Anne Rice novel on Blu-Ray, don't bother. There is no evidence of up scaling, added features, ""making of"" documentaries, interviews with a cast...nothing. I think my DVD version looks better. The film is one of the best vampire movies ever made. Tom Cruise is dead on in his portrayal of Lestat, and Kirsten Dunst's portrayal of Claudia is delicious. She steals almost every scene she is in.Skip the Blu-Ray and get the DVD if you don't already own it.Interview with the Vampire"
2,"Great movie, bad Blu-Ray","Interview with the Vampire [Blu-ray]I had a few extra dollars on an Amazon gift card and hadn't seen this movie in some time. It fit the amount I had left to spend so I ordered it to add to my new Blu-Ray collection. While I enjoyed the movie as much as I remembered, the disc did not meet the high standards I've come to expect from Blu-Ray. No popup menu, no real selection of features, and a video transfer that would be acceptable on a budget DVD, but not in 1080p. The intro by the director looks like a worn VHS tape. It's certainly watchable, but I expected much better. I got a movie I wanted to enjoy again in pretty good picture instead of amazing Blu-Ray picture."
3,Good movie-loses points of bad quality image,"I really loved loved the movie itself.Great actors, One of Tom Cruise's finest (seriously). The actors were really captiviting, the special effects blended in beautifully.Buttttttttt1. I got special features when I pressed play2. The face of the background when there is someone in the foreground is blurry.3.Very poor quality of images, you get wavy vcr-like lines get irritating at one point (e.g wavy lines on brad pitt's faces). If you buy it, go for HDMaybe some won't mind, but I would have liked to have been warned as I expected good quality as promised"
4,"A great movie, though not quite true to the book...","I saw this movie before I first read Anne Rice's novel, which I think was a good thing. I started off without any preconceptions. When I first saw it, and even now I think it is a fantastic movie. The acting is all around superb, Brad Pitt manages to capture Louis' tortured emotions toward his victims, Tom Cruise is gorgeous, sexy, and proud to be an indiscriminate killer (""none closer to God than We""), and finally Kirstin Dunst is incredible as Claudia, innocent and evil, totally adult. Before I read the book I was content with everything in INTERVIEW. However after I had read it I wished to see more of Armand. He was so mysterious and delicious in the novel that I was surprised that there was so little of his interactions with Louis in the movie. But oh well... the movie is still one of my favorites, and no little inconsistancies are going to bother me. -Eli@"
3,SOLID AND SURPRISING,"Everyone knows that no one wanted Tom Cruise to play the lead of the vampire Lestat in this film. Everyone just knew he was too much of a lightweight pretty boy to pull it off. Writer Anne Rice was livid with this casting choice. However, Cruise surprised everyone when he pulled off a stunning and sexy performance. Anne Rice herself was said to be surprised and even more than that, delighted. Cruise's outstanding performance coupled with the performances of Brad Pitt, Christian Slater, Antonio Banderas and Kirsten Dunst, then just a child, precocious as she was, made this film good. And on top of this the scenery was lavish and moody just as you would expect. I am not a fan of vampire stories nor of Anne Rice, nor particularly of Tom Cruise of Brad Pitt, but I will say that this film was surprising in every way."
4,Not the typical movie,"How is it that very few books become top movies? Interview With the Vampire is alluring enough as a book, the movie even more seductive. When I first saw the movie I cried for Louis and continue to do so when ever I watched it. No part was left out, but I just wish that the makers could of used the same filming technique that was used in Sleepy Hollow. The pain of a vampire that can feel as humans do that is just sheer talent. An actor that can portray that vampire that is just charisma. Kirsten Dunst showed us an exact copy of Claudia and how we all feel. The vampire tale is not the usual Dracula version. The emtion and hope that was put into this amkes everyone think. Perhaps I think more than others do, but can we not see ourselves be like these creatures in some ways? We all have the selfish side, we are all tormented by something, we are all cold and ucaring in some way. We are truly vampires in certain ways."
2,Pitt is not a good actor!,"Whoever said that Brad Pitt could act is an idiot. I first saw the movie, and read the the book. I found the book more interesting than the movie. I dont like the fact that hollywood makes up characters instead of following the characters in the book, example who in the hell is the widow Ste. Claire. What happened to Freneire.Tom Cruise was a passable Lestat, but Pitt as Louis, I felt was dragging thru the scenes.It felt like he didnt want to play in a movie with gay undertones. He even had the nerve to criticize Rice's Vampire Chronicles. How it left him depressed. If you ask me nothing was more depressing than watching this actor portraying the beautiful Louis. Cruise is just to full of himself to portay Lestat. Banderas was not a convincing Armand. The only real good character here was Dunst as Claudia. Another thing is the next time they should use younger actors to portray these characters."
4,Interview with the Vampire,The DVD movie arrived in a timely manner and was in excellent condition.I have played it and it has no skips or scratches. I am pleased.Thank you.
5,Completely satisfied,"I am completely satisfied with the product, the seller, and the amount of time that it took to be delivered."
5,Vamps,This movie tells the story of vampires from a vampires point of view. Moving through the ages without aging and never dying. Lonely and cold. Also tells the story of the vampire Lestat- who is names in many other vampire movies... namely Queen of the Damned. This is a must for the vampire fan to have in their collection.
5,Great transaction!,"I would like to say that this was a very good transaction, because the movie arrived very promptly and in great shape. I would definitely purchase again from this buyer.Thanks for a great transaction!Polvo"
1,THIS is the BEST BluRay you could do??!!??,"Let me begin by saying that I absolutely ADORE this film...my rating is for the BluRay transfer and presentation ONLY. This version SUCKS...especially for THIRTY BUCKS. Only a couple of moments in the Theatres des Vampires appear slightly crisp and refined, the rest is no better than the standard DVD. 'IWTV' deserved better than this rubbish. Shame on you Warner Bros., you did a FANTASTIC job on The LoSt BoYS but on this film you dropped the ball.AND GET NEW DVD EXTRAS FROM THIS DECADE! THEY ARE LO-DEF AND TIRED LOOKING!Don't waste your money."
3,Its maybe better than DVD but Blu Ray...not the best,At first I thought I had problems with my TV or PS3 but for Blu ray it dosent seem that vivid. I bought it at Target for $10 so not disappointed....much I love the movie but the quality seems not the best compared to Edward Scissor hands wow thats worth the purchase.
3,BRAD PITT AND TOM CRUISE TOGETHER...,"BRAD PITT AND TOM CRUISE TOGETHER IS PROBABLY THE ONLY REASON TO WATCH THIS MOVIE. IT WAS BORING AND DRAGGED OUT. I WOULDN'T EVEN WASTE MY TIME ON IT. I GAVE IT 3 STARS JUST BECAUSE TOM CRUISE AND BRAD PITT STAR IT IN. THEY ARE VERY SEXY IN THIS PICTURE BUT THAT ALONE DOESN'T MAKE A GOOD MOVIE. I HAVE READ THE BOOK AND THINK THAT THIS MOVIE DID IT NO JUSTICE. IF YOU MUST GET A ANNE RICE DOSE, STICK TO THE BOOK. THE MOVIE IS NOT WORTH IT AND DOESN'T GIVE ANNE RICE HER DUE."
5,A dark golden reverie,"If you love to lose yourself in a movie, you will revel in the antique melancholy of the gorgeous imagery presented here. Some people, however, may not want to watch a picture that addresses the practicalities of vampirism, that is, ending human life. The irony is that a film which makes you empathise with the victim's fear is called inhuman, while most high body-count blockbusters receive comparatively little criticism.For those who have read the book, the plot is abbreviated and several characters are gone, but the heart of the story, and the poignant atmosphere, remain. Also, I came to the novel only after seeing the movie, and found that some of the movie's best lines weren't even in the book! (E.g. ""The gods kill indiscriminately, and so shall we [...]"") It turned out that Anne Rice had a large hand in the screenplay."
4,A walk in the dark past,I bought this movie also for my Daughter as she requested. I like the two stars acting ability. In this yester year fantasy you could see the conflict of emotions. I did feel that there was alot more that could have been done with the story without all the bloody details. After all everyone knows what vampires do.
3,not widescreen,if you are looking for the wide screen version this is not widescreen. you want the special edition widescreen this is a pan and scan.they have room on the disc they should put both on the one disc.
5,I enjoyed this movie alot,"This is one of the best vampire movies ever made besides BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA. I really liked it, and the story kept me interested. I cannot remember one dull moment. Tom Cruise gives one of his best performances, and so does everyone else, including the absolutley wonderful debut from Kirsten Dunst! This was also a very creepy movie with a freaky atmosphere, and lots of it gave me cold chills. Great movie from Neil Jordan. The score is excellent, too. The ending is one of the best that I've seen in a while!This one is recommended for older audiences, due to graphic violence and two scenes of nudity."
3,Mm...,"This wasn't that interesting to me as the other Vampire Chronicles, but still good. It was told from Louis' point of view, so lestat seemed rather...""bad."" I didn't liek Claudia all too much either."
4,Hollywood's Red Red Tape,"Anyone who is a Ricean Vampire Chronicles fan knows that Hollywood does the books injustice. Louis has black hair and green eyes, Armand should of looked 17 with auburn hair and hazel eyes seeing he was from Russia. Louis was depressed because his brother died, not a wife and child. Daniel, had violet eyes.. the time that Louis was giving the interview should of been 1970s.They never talked about Armand's attempts to make Claudia a woman, etc etc.The only thing that they did get right was Lestat, somewhat. Tom was a perfect choice because of the smile, but Lestat himself should of looked at least 20 years old and he looked older.Other than that, they kept to the storyline.Kudos."
5,SCARRRY LOVER,"IT IS SIMPLE. THIS IS A GOOD TIGHT EFFORT TO DO A VAMPIRE FLICK WITH SOME DEPTH TO IT. THE EFFORT HAS SUCCEEDED. THE DIRECTING, ACTING, AND THE WRITING CORRECTLY COMBINED INTO A GOOD SOLID ""SCARRY"" RESULTS THAT THE INTELLIGENT FOLKS COULD ENJOY. I ONLY WISH THAT THIS TYPE OF FILM, WITH ITS DEPTH COULD BE MADE MORE OFTEN. SADLY, THIS HAS NOT BEEN TRUE, SO FAR."
5,The best vampire movie ever made.,This is one of my favorite movies of all time. It is an accurate interpretation of the book to say the least. All of actors did a wonderful job interpreting the characters.
4,Interview with a Vampirre,I really enjoyed this movie. The historic journey the Vampire takes is incredible. Very well done. The cast is awesome also.
5,Another great Vampire movie if not the best.,"""When I first hear about this movie a few days after Movie Theater, I was kind of sock. According to ppl they almost make biological stuff in their pants because of the fright of this movie. However once I was abble to see it I knew that People was exagerating. This movie is a peace of art in vampiric proportions.It had been made with elegance and a gentle touch. Even tough there is quite some blood especially when Lestat gets hungry it also looks tempting and subtle.I highly recommend this movie. A great add to any collection with a great cast.I hope that the rest of Anne Rice vampire Chronicles will me on film some day."""
4,Anne Rice's Vampires Come to Life!,"This is the first movie based on one of Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles. There was a great deal of debate among longtime fans of Rice's work about the casting, especially the casting of Tom Cruise as the vampire Lestat. Tom really was not the ""type"" Anne described in her books at all but he pulls off an excellent performance all the same. His co-star Brad Pitt was an excellent choice for Lestat's long-suffering companion Lois. Together Lestat and Lois raise a child vampire Claudia who ultimately is infuriated with being a woman trapped forever in the body of a child. The movie stayed very true to the original novel, perhaps because the screenplay was also done by Anne Rice. A must see movie for fans of Anne Rice or vampire flicks."
5,An Excellent Dark Movie.,"When i first sat down to see this, i expected a boring 2 hour B movie. But after i had seen the first ten minutes, i realized that this may be an excellent movie. Cruise and Pitt handles their roles superb as the evil Lestat and the tormented Louis. I haven't read the book but i think, after this, i maybe will."
4,Deserves Praise And Respect.,"I watched this movie again after not seeing it for quite some time. Still a great movie from start to finish. Interview With the Vampire is almost flawless in all aspects. I think Tom Cruise delivered a great performance, and that this is his best movie. Kirstin Dunst also did a remarkable job in her part. This movie never slumps, nor loses its momentum the entire film--that's rare among most movies. A well done film that can be watched more than once and never disappoint. Recommended."
3,Blu Ray transfer looks terrible.,"I cant believe this is being sold as a Blu Ray dvd. It does not look like a Blu Ray at all, but rather a standard dvd. This movie deserves better than this. Save your money."
3,Perhaps the only dissenter on Tom Cruise's performance,"Anne Rice's dark and maudlin tales are among my favorite in the vampire genre. However, I never bought Tom Cruise as Lestat. I am sure he tried very hard, but he never convinced me. I was sorry that Anne Rice recanted her initial vehement objection to his playing the role. Brad Pitt and Antonio Banderas, on the other hand, were excellently cast. I read that Anne Rice patterned Lestat after a young Rutger Hauer. It's a pity he was too old to play the part in this movie, as he would have been brilliant in it."
5,Best vampire movie ever!!!,"I have never seen such a vampire movie before. I have seen the Interview with the vampire tons of times but I am so impressed. Tom Cruise plays Lestat so well. He is cruel and beautiful. Brad Pitt is an awesome Louis, he acts so well, and he is the most beautiful man in the world. And I think the other actors are great too. Sorry for my English, I am Hungarian. I don't really like other vampire movies for example Blade, Underworld (I love vampires but these movie are not really about the REAL vampires). Recommended movie!!!!"
1,Worst Blu Ray so far,"I bought the original DVD and then the special edition. Comparing the DVD vs. the blu-ray with the DVD on a low end multidisc Sony and the Samsung BDP-1200 which was considered about the best Blu-ray, I can't believe how little difference there is. The Blu ray looks like they tried to make it blurry and have no color. I have an older DTS receiver, so the DVD audio is actually better for me on the DVD, which is all the more insulting. Until now, the 2 years ago Sleepy Hollow Blu ray was my worst purchase, this far exceeds it. The extras are lame and in SD. this should be $4.99. Save your money! Worst Blu-ray remastering EVER!"
1,Very poor quality for a blu-ray.,"While this movie is fantastic, the quality on this blu-ray is way below expectations. I'm glad that I have this movie in my collection now, but I wish they had done a better job with the transfer."
3,MOVIE 5 STARS- BLU RAY 0/5 SAME AS REGULAR DVD,"The movie is great .. one of the besthowever the blu ray is the same as the regular dvd so if you're waiting for a clear pic special effects etc..there are none so save yourmoney on this, maybe thats why its 9.$"
4,"Nice Movie, should have followed the book more","I really liked this movie, but I wish I had not read the book first. The movie leaves out too much. If you like this movie I would definately recomend that you read the book after."
4,"""I want some more""","I love this film because of it's passionate sensual mood. All the actors portrayed the vampires as they should be, firece, sexy creatures of the night. Tom Cruise was fantastic as Lestat and if/when you make a movie of ""The Vampire Lestat"", Cruise is the only one who can play Lestat. Although the video didn't follow the book exactly I still think it did it great justice. The costume and design was definitely something to be desired, I think I can speak for every vampire fan when I say at the end of this film all I could think of was ""Bite me""."
5,"A great movie alone, but pales in comparison to the book....","I first saw the movie when it came out in the theaters and have recently rented it to relive this masterpiece of a movie. First I have to say though that it doesn't follow the book all that closely, leaving out important details that build the characters flamboyant personalities. Besides that minor bickering about it, I found this movie to be one of the best and most interesting ever made. It is a combination of horror/drama that manages to expose so many humanistic dilemmas that I doubt will be surpassed any time soon. The only movie out right now that almost but not quite matches the greatness of this movie would have to be The Matrix (which by the way seems to have many biblical conotations to it)"
3,"some problems, but pretty good","The movie as a whole was a very decent endeavor, however there are some problems. Firstly, Tom Cruise is not a very good vampire, there are several reasons why this is, and the biggest is that it's not a typical role for him and he just isn't very convincing. Secondly, Bandaras, awful choice for a vampire, especially considering how his character was in the book. The only casting choices that were good, are Dunst as Claudia, and Pitt as Louis. Personally, I didn't expect much from Pitt either, however he really did an excellent job protraying the tortured Louis. The movie also has some problems with a slow-moving plot, it is by no means awful, and is pretty good as far as vampire movies go."
3,Good but not great . . .,"Fans of Rice's vampire books will likely be disappointed by the performances in this movie, although the script is faithful to ""Interview"" and the makeup effects are inspired. None of the actors seem to catch the flavor of the characters as Rice created them, although Kirsten Dunst is marvellous as Claudia. Tom Cruise isn't bad as Lestat, he's just, well, a little too Tom Cruise-ish. END"
4,Not as good at the book,"This wasn't as good as the book it's based off but it has brand Pitt who remains a hot god, so it gets four stars."
5,One of the best vampire movies ever!,"I love Interveiw with the Vampire! Brad Pitt and TOm Cruise are great in it, and so is kirsten Dunst."
2,film KILLED by REALLY bad casting choices,"For the most part, I didn't hate this film. However, Tom Cruise should NEVER have been cast as Lestat, imo. He almost looked the part, but he just didn't play it well (there are parts in the film where his acting is like a rake across a chalkboard). Also - Antonio Banderas as ARMAND? Armand, the 15 year old auburn/red haired vampire? Granted, Antonio played the role VERY well. However, were the casting crew members on drugs when they decided how to cast this? Bradd Pitt and Kirsten Dunst were both really good. On the whole, just about everyone was (except for Tom Cruise). Still - really slap-shod job on the whole. The book is far, FAR better than the film. Sadly, ""Queen of the Damned"" which is basically ""Vampire Lestat"" and ""Queen of the Damned"" all jam packed into one film (with creative liberties GALORE) was STILL better than this one, imo."
3,Drink and Join me in Enternal Life,"I would say this is a good vampire movie, except it did not please me. Number 1, No stakes. Number 2, in the movie Vampires have reflections. Number 3 Vampires do sleep in coffins with soil, but in this movie, They just sleep in ordinary coffins. And Number 4, The Vampires did not remind me of true vampires.The film is better than Queen of the Damn, also by Anne Rice."
1,Give me Dracula any day,"This movie is rather ridiculous. It makes a point to down all parts of the Dracula story (which was the original and by far the best). I hate how each new vampire movie changes the ""rules"" to which the vampire abides. I have read several of Ann Rice's vampire novels, trying my hardest to like them. Each time I was left wondering why her books are so popular."
2,Doesn't dry,"I bought this bath toy because I liked that it was less toxic than a typical plastic rubber ducky, but I am not happy with it. It doesn't dry between uses even if I wring it out. Because it stays damp, it gets mildewy spots. It does do fine in the wash, but who wants to have to put a bath toy through the laundry on a daily basis?"
5,This is the best gift for all of my children,"This is a wonderful book. I am 82 year old. But I can understand it very well. Although it is very scientific, it uses common language that people can understand easily. By using the protocols, I have lost 20 pounds, and felt much better. I want to buy 7 more copies to each of my children."
4,Comes in handy,Easy to fold out and is surprisingly comfortable! I wish it was a little smaller when it is folded up so I could easily put it in a back pack but other than that I love it! It does have a carry strap that you can use since it doesn't fit in a back pack. That works well and it is light weight!
5,Great product!,"I have used it only a couple of times until now, but my impression is that it'll last forever! High quality material. Very comfortable and sturdy."
2,Broke after first use,"I bought this chair for a motorcycle camping trip because of its packable size. My initial thoughts on the chair were that it looked solid and well built. I sat in the chair for about an hour before one of the steel legs start stabbing through the foot. The ground was a little sandy, but solid. I am close to the weight limit they state in the description, but this looks like the plastic was too soft for the sharp ends of the steel tubing. The remainder of the chair seems well built. Item returned."
2,good for 5 or 10 minutes,"everybody sat on this for a short period of time, good size, portability, just not much of a seat, get a blue max"
2,very uncomfortable,"the seat is to low to the ground, and too small don't move the wrong way or males may have catastrophy."
2,Good Idea/Poor Execution,"I chose this item because the chair was advertised with the ability to handle a certain weight level. Plus: It arrived in great packaging and was very lightweight, which made it easy to carry. Minus: Although I was at least 30# below the weight level; after 4 uses, the chair totally collapsed and left me on the ground. The bolt came out (also breaking the hole)and could not be repaired. (Could plastic components have been the problem?) Fortunately, since the chair was low to the ground, I was not injured. I wound up buying a different, cheaper chair."
5,batteries,"So far so good, I bought four of these and have yet just used one of them although I did charge all of them.I put it in my EDC light (Sunwayman V10A) & I use it every night. The battery has been in there for 3+ weeks yet still has power for full brightness 450+ lumens. I will buy these again if they are ever needed."
1,Very Poor design.,"This Chair is uncomfortable and Dangerous! When I tried to use the chair, the target was so small my rear end missed the chair and I found myself on the floor. I was just off by a few inches but the chair is unforgiving, it slipped out from under me and Kaboom I was on the floor.The chair looks like it would be fine for children, 6 to 12, but it is dangerous for any one over 17. It is definitely not for Seniors."
5,Great Little Chair,I love this chair. It works just as I hoped. If I ever lose it I will immediately buy another one.
2,Better Backpacking Chairs Out There,"I ordered this stool with the intention of bringing it backpacking. It's just too big to bring with me, the claim that it is smaller than a rolled up newspaper is true of diameter, but not true on height at all. I'd say it's probably about 25-27 inches long when folded. The weight also comes in play here, it's a little over 30 ounces when other comparable products (both style and price) weigh-in at 18 ounces.I knew about the warning label (thanks to other reviewers) before I ordered, and certainly wasn't thrilled about it, but certainly plays a factor in my review.On the plus side for the chair, it's built in strap is a plus, if you are planning on bringing this to an amusement park or the beach I think it would do rather well. the feet are angled which will help with stability.Shorten the chair, make the legs aluminum, remove the cancer chemicals, and I'm sold, but for today, this is a returned product."
3,Uncomfortable for long stretches,"Pretty and seems practical, but for long-term sitting it is painful. Every body part in contact with the chair goes numb after a while. I am a bit heavy so it could just be my body weight is too much for this. (Chair is plenty strong enough for my weight, by the way.) It might be fine for lighter people and children."
5,Very Handy Little Chair!,This is a very compact travel chair and is very light. The construction is excellent. This is just the thing one needs when attending an event where there is extensive walking involved and little or no seating is available. This product quickly provides a place to sit and take a take break for a few minutes. It then very quickly folds up and is ready to go. It is small enough to go in a backpack or sling over your shoulder.
4,"very portable, but unstable for average build guys","Bought this to take to kids basketball games due to small/limited court side space availability. Works well for petite wife and kids, but dangerous for me (190lb) due to the wobbling of the three legs. When I sit, the legs spread out and feels as if they are ready to crumble. I haven't fallen down yet, but not waiting for that to happen either. Needless to say, I sit on the floor and wife/kids sit on the chair. Took one star away for that.Otherwise, it's extremely convenient - light weight, quick to setup, and fits anywhere in the car."
5,Convenient seat,I have a lot of trouble walking any distance without sitting for a minute. This little stool is light weight & easy to carry for such times.
1,Don't waste your time,Don't waste your time ordering this chair unless you a magician or you are a pole sitter. Instead just take 3 twigs and try to balance your body on them. If you weigh over 100 lbs select another product.
4,"light weight, good construction","I bought this w/ 2 purposes in mind, one to carry and use to sit on if needed, right size for me, but I'm not sure how comfortable if might be for heavier set persons.My second purpose was to use it underneath a table at a conference as I can't sit for long periods w/ my feet down. Used it for this, which worked quite well. Not obvious."
4,Slacker Stool,"I am very happy with the Slacker Stool. I'm a big guy and this stool holds my weight and is comfortable. I purchased this stool for a 20 mile backpacking trip, it is lightweight and compact."
3,Thought it was a good chair,I thought this would be a good chair to have with me when gardening. It broke the first time out. I do not think it was the chair but the soil. Had to throw out a brand new chair. :(
2,"Ouch!!! Well, this was certainly an error in judgment!","The tripod configuration and seat size renders this travel chair painfully uncomfortable for anyone owning male genitalia or weighing more than 120 pounds. On the other hand, since the chair seems to be rather durable, it should be quite acceptable for smaller women and children."
5,Slacker Chair,The chair is great. The first chair I got was missing a rubber foot. I was sent a replacement before I even had a chance to get the defective chair in the mail. Great customer service!!!!!!!!!. Thank You!!
5,omg,"love this stool, small compact, fits rightnin my chair bag, holds a ton of weight, dries almost instantly. great price and shipped quickly."
5,Great for a rest!,"I think I'm going to love my travelchair. I have bad knees and can't stand for long periods of time, so I am hoping this will be just what I need while traveling. It's very lightweight and sits good, stable."
2,"Small seat, cheap construction.....","It didnt last for one round of disc golf on the limestone terrain here in central Texas. This chair is great for the backyard or as a backup/emergency chair only. Small seat, good for a small person or child. Shipped on time and in great condition, just didnt last. Male: 5'10"", 150lbs, Ended up buying a camptime stool. If your looking for a tournament stool for disc golf, this is not it."
4,The feet arent the best,"This is a relatively cheap chair that gets the job done, the only problem is the feet on the bottom of the chair dont stay on too well. The first time I sat in it in soft soil, it pushed down and the foot fell off. Then since there is no foot on it, the leg sinks down and you fall off the chair. I fixed it by putting a small screw threw each footing into the pipe its attached to. (maybe the manufacturer should do that). After the modification it works pretty good.FYI. It might be a little uncomfortable if you sit for a long time as the front of the chair wraps around and grips a little too tight for my liking if you know what I mean :/ But I believe that will happen with any 3 legged chair by design.Overall, its cheap and with a minor modification its pretty good for short periods."
3,Excellent traveler (if you have a small rear end.),"This traveler chair is really well made and is light and easy to carry, especially since a attached shoulder strap is included. For short term sitting! The size of the seat is quite small for an adult, perfect for a child. However, if you just need a stool-type chair for temporary rest, it is as good as they get."
2,Plastic feet fell off,"We bought two of these for the kids at Christmas. The height of this chair is good - it's taller than most similar chairs, and is lightweight and easy to carry with the strap. However, the plastic feet fell off pretty much immediately. We did glue them back on, but the ones we'd bought from REI just seem to be better made. I think I'll probably end up using this when we camp due to the height. The chair is usable, but it was kind of a shocker when it was ""broken"" out of the bag."
2,It works then breaks,"I had this stool for a couple of months and I loved it, it was so handy..until it broke. Now I'm not a heavy person and having the pole tear through the cloth was rather disheartening. I do love the idea of this stool, but the company should make it stronger."
1,Warranty issue / dangerous?,"I bought this little chair in March of this year (2012). One of the things I found attractive about it was the weight limit. I'm a big guy: 6'2"" and every bit of 235 lbs. I don't mess with 225 lb limit items. This one is supposed to be 275. It has gone on a few camping/hunting trips and has done well. Well, at least until 15 minutes ago, when while sitting on it in my garage packing away camping gear, it absolutely collapsed on me. One of the legs sheared through the plastic ring. Landing on concrete on your tailbone is not fun. I will be contacting the manufacturer to find out about warranty. Though I'm not sure I trust the product now, even if they send me a new one.FOLLOW UP: I have to give credit to the folks at Travelchair. They were responsive to my complaint/warranty claim. They replaced the slacker chair and sent me another, larger chair for my trouble. A week and 1/2 on, I'm still quite sore. I hope they look into what caused my chair to fail."
5,McCaulay,All my grandchildren have enjoyed watching this movie over and over again. It is so very entertaining and educational.
5,Teaching: A Great literature tool!,I have been a reading specialist for two years and a classroom teacher for one. I found this movie a great asset to enhance the understanding of book genres. I also found it to be very interesting for those who have read or are familiar with many classics. There are so many references to the classics in this movie. It was a great visual tool for students to understand types of books and develop an excitement for books!
5,EXCELLENT BUSINESS TRANSACTION,I ORDERED THE MOVIE AND IT WAS SHIPPED AND DELIVERED QUICKLY. ITEM WAS AS DESCRIBED
3,Great fantasy/adventure/literary movie for kids.,"My son loves this movie! I love that it shows the different types of books in a library and that all types of adventures can be achieved with just the use of a library card. A wonderful story for ""the underdog"" All children will enjoy this boy on his journey to find courage and his love for books."
3,My 3 year old thinks it's great!,"This is a regularly rented video at our house which is why I'm buying it. My 3 year old son LOVES pirates, dragons, all that stuff. I don't find the movie terribly interesting or inspiring, but he likes it much better than Little Mermaid, Beauty & the Beast or other Disney fare that parents are so crazy about!"
2,"Great Idea, mediocre execution","I watched this movie a few times when I was a kid, so I had the advantage of nostalgia when I last looked at it now that I'm older. Frankly, it doesn't hold up.This is such a great idea for a film but there's one major problem: the kid is already a bookworm! He babbles on about statistics in the first 20 minutes which means he would have to had READ all of those statistics in a book! Why would you encourage a bookworm to read even more? That's like telling a drug addict to do more drugs! This movie would have worked better if they had the kid be addicted to video games, TV, sports, or anything NOT related to reading.Also, the movie has no structure, the characters are generic, the literary aspects are just glanced over, and it's just a bore. This is such a great idea for a movie, but there's not much effort. Kids deserve stories that have real effort and imagination."
3,so-so movie,"Richard Tylor is a timid little boy who is concerned with safety. He runs into a library when a strom comes up, and enters an animated adventure. There, Richard must find the EXIT to the animated world and get to his home. Along the way, he befriends three books who can talk: Adventure, Horror and Fanasty (spelling?). To find the exit, Richard must get passed three worlds which are named after the talking books. He meets Long John Silver, Moby Dick, and a dragon that's guarding the exit.The animation is so-so, not the best in the world and not the worst. Worth watching once."
5,"Man, I blinked and it was here.","I ordered this movie, at night on August 8 and I received it on August 10. The condition of the movie was just as discribed. I would definitely order from them again. I love this movie and I have always loved it."
3,Movie,"This movie kinda sucks now that I am older. Clearly it would be, I haven't seen this movie in so many years. But still brought back good memories. But the movie sucks MUHAHAHAHAHAHA!"
1,The Boringmaster,"This movie is boring. Nothing happens. It is a good cause to teach kids to read but they messed up BIG TIME. They don't explain who the book characters are at all. The kid is nothing more then a walking cardboard cut-out. The book puns are painful to listin to and just as bad as the ice puns from Mr.Freeze from Batman & Robin. The Books themselfs are infuriating & more cartoony then have to be. Even The Dragon is boring and it barely moves but worst of all,it eats books...BOOKS!!! What kind of dragon eats books? Overall,the only thing this film teaches me is that movies can be just as boring as books. The name of the film itself sounds like a fake award they give at a library. I give this film a 2 out of 10."
5,Books!,What a cute movie! My boyfriend introduced me to this movie. It is a good film with a good story line. The animation was good and we really enjoy this film. Worth watching.
3,"Islanders 1, Authorities 0","More fun from Ealing Studios. If you enjoyed The Waking of Ned Devine, you'll love this one!"
2,2nd- or 3rd-generation homemade(?) copy,"The film adaptation is okay -- not nearly as good as the book, but certainly okay and re-watchable, especially for such a short film. It would have taken 3 hours to do the book real justice.One reviewer lamented (possibly in jest) the lack of subtitles. I can only say that the language was much more anglicised than the one I grew up speaking and hearing, so I'd no trouble at all with it. I can't say whether it would cause problems for anyone else.The copy I bought, made by ""Nostalgia Family Video"" in Baker City Oregon, is of poor quality. The image is low-contrast and washed-out, and the sound isn't the best. It seems to have been created using low-tech methods. They have a 2007 copyright notice on the box, but it's not clear how they came by it--I'm fairly sure Ealing still own the copyright, since they sell this film as part of a package of 5 (available from Amazon).The quality of this copy is poor enough that I plan to return it for refund."
4,The Fast and the Furious,"Great old B&W movie for those who like old sports cars, especially Jags of the XK-120 vintage. Good footage of races with Jaguars, Triumphs, MG TDs, Austin Healeys, Allards, and even a Nash-Healy."
3,Little,I only got this because as a kid this book was read to us over and over and we liked it.Was not from the south so it did not have any negitive meanings for us.
2,It's not worth it.,"I know this is only $7 but it's honestly not worth the money. The quality was crap, there was a green line on the bottom of the screen from beginning to end and the translation was horrible. Not only that, but it looks like it was a homemade DVD. If I wanted to settle for that, I could have burned it myself for free. If I knew how, which I don't, which is why I bought this.So if you're not satisfied watching this fantastic series on YouTube (which has superior quality compared to this) and want it on DVD, then I'd suggest shelling out the extra ten bucks for the official one."
4,Useful for students and history buffs,"This book is a chronologically-arranged series of biographies of important figures active in English history from 1485 to 1603. It's highly useful for students and for people with an interest in the period trying to find out quick but accurate information on someone they see mentioned elsewhere. It's not a great browsing book, but is an excellent reference resource. It's one of a series of books covering most of English and, later, British history. The only drawback is that its confinement to England means that some important players in Tudor history, such as the rebel Irish leaders of Elizabeth's reign, are omitted. However, it does include key Scots like Mary Stuart and Darnley."
1,Headline: Baby barely survives escapade with dog babysitter,"So scary it's hilarious, this book had to have been the creation of one of those ""my dog is my baby"" people, whom we have to hope are, and hopefully remain, childless. A mother leaves her baby alone when she leaves the house, which is illegal, not cute, not a delightful opening for a children's book. Letting a baby go down a laundry chute, again, not cute. Letting baby swim--SWIM! A baby!--in a fish tank...I won't go on, but if you want a kid's book to show to your adult friends and get a HUGE, dark laugh at, Good Dog Carl will make a great Christmas/Hanukkah/Kwanza present. If you want to share a story with your kids that doesn't defy fundamental parental instincts, try something, no...anything else."
5,The sweetest story--kids of all ages can read it to you,"Hardly any words, so kids of all ages can read the story to adults, and everyone can guffaw at this outrageous story of a dog-nanny."
5,A special family dog,This book was a joy to receive as I have a poodle. The illustrations speak volumes with out written words.
5,Thanks,"Thanks so much for Good Dog Carl, which arrived in fabulous condition and very quickly. I would definitely buy from this seller again."
2,It has hardly any words that's the good part.,"It makes for a wonderful book when your toddler is going through one of those stages of just wanting to read the same book over and over and over and over and over b/c there isn't much for you to read.I have to admit though that although I find the illustrations charming the whole premise is kind of creepy. I always end the reading with, ""And then CPS came and took the mother away and placed baby with a loving, responsible family and Carl went on to star in his own TV show."" I don't want my daughter being left with the impression that if we get a dog at some point it will be babysitting. I'm all for catharsis in children's books to show irresponsible behavior, etc. I think this one is disturbing b/c the parent is the one that's so horrible. The kid and dog are doing what one would expect."
1,Great if you're not a toddler,"Love the art & the concept, and, yes, it's very funny. But I would NOT recommend the book for the 1 year old to 3 year old crowd that the board book targets. Or anyone with a sibling that age. I have pretty tame girls, but still my 18 month old, if she so much as saw the picture, would immediately copy it. My three year old, in a silly moment, would try to be the family pet and get the 18 month old to climb on her back from the crib.Toddlers and preschool kids don't know any better, don't necessarily see it as silly, and are excellent imitators. This should not be a board book, I think that is misleading. Great art & concept, cute story too if you are old enough to separate silly from real."
1,I hate HATE HATE this book,"You read about it every day in the news. Because people just can't seem to learn. Headline: Child gets mauled and killed by family pet. So let's enforce that in a children's book so they can learn stupidity when they are real young. If it didn't happen in real life so much, then it would be a cute story. But why a Rotwieler? Why not a golden retriever? And why can't the mother be getting the mail from the mailbox or doing something a little more sensible. Mother leaving the house to go shopping while leaving a Rotwieler to look after the baby is just a plain dumb story and any responsible adult wouldn't buy or read this book. Stick with the time tested books like Seuss or Eric Carle."
1,"horrible book about neglectful parenting,","A Mother leaves an infant alone in a house with a rotweiler. the Rotwieler pushed the baby down the laundry chute and puts him in a fish tank. Then for dinner the rotweiler gives the baby butter. To finish the book the dog gives the baby a bath and the mother comes back and thanks the dog for taking care of the baby!WTF! What a horrible book it is a primarily picture book on top of that, so it does not even benefit my child's literacy."
5,Wonderful imaginative book,"My 2 yo LOVES this book (and the other Carl books we have). We've been reading it every day for months and he's never tried to slide down a laundry chute or swim in a fish tank as one reviewer suggested he would. The drawings are lovely and the detail provides opportunity for great games of ""Do you see the..."""
3,"Good Dog, Carl","I buy this book for all ""newborns"" as a gift from our Rottweiler! However, usually the book is ""larger""! This book is much smaller than the books I previously purchased so I was very disappointed. I am debating whether to return it and ""try again""! Pictures are great in these books. No words - just pictures! Make stories up as you go!"
1,nothing like i read about,I read about this product in people mag. Jennifer Aniston said she uses it and it keeps her lips nice and soft. She also said it has a nice smell. I have not been using very long but so far no changes and I do not care for the smell at all.
4,Fun 4 Dora Mermaid Fans,"Adorable Dora. The cutest in the series. I don't have any issues with her hair like the other reviewer, but the top layer of tulle on her skirt did come off in little coral shaped pieces. That didn't bother me too much, and I tend to be particular. My 3 yo DD loves playing out Dora Saves the Mermaids with this Dora and Mariana and the Sea Carriage. Dora Saves the Mermaids was a HIT at our house. We've given the other Doras in the series as gifts so her friends bring them to play DSTM at our house. Tons of fun!"
2,Corso's book a dry read with little believeability.,"Phillip Corso's ""The Day After Roswell"" is, at first blush an exciting look into the world of black ops and reverse engineering. However, once you begin to read Mr. Corso's tale of his management of the Pentagon's reverse engineering of ""alien technology,"" you discover a startlingly dull and boring account from a dull man who spends much of his book worshipping his former superior officer. This book is incoherent at its best, and at its worst it is a terrible bait-and-switch pulled on the Roswell Phenomenon enthusiast. This book claims to blow the lid off Roswell. Instead, it puts you to sleep with the sketchy rememberances of a career military man apparently out to make a buck. Save your money."
4,This book will make you re-evaluate...,"This book will make you re-evaluate everything you ever thought about ufos, aliens, and the role the government plays in concealing information from the public. This book should be an eye-opener to any reasonably intelligent adult. There is too much evidence here to not make one ponder whether we truly have been visited by aliens. Whether you already believe in aliens or not, this book should be read with an opend mind and let the facts in the book speak for themselves."
5,X-Files Reference Textbook of Military Control & Viewpoint,"Easy, must read for X-File viewers and those still doubting visitors for elsewhere !"
4,CONVINCING UFO CRASH ( INCONSISTENCIES/TECHNICALLY LACKING),"OKAY, A UFO CRASHED OUTSIDE OF ROSWELL IN 1947.THIS OLD GUY JUST VEERED OFF COURSE AT NUMEROUS TIMES AND FREQUENTLY WAS TECHNICALLY WEAK.HE PRODUCED MORE PARTS, IDEAS, AND INFORMATION THAT COULD EVER FIT INTO ANY GOVERNMENT FILE CABINET.NO SKETCHES OR TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION WERE INCLUDED TO BACK UP WHAT HE CLAIMED IN THE BOOK.MOST OF THE TECHNOLOGY HE CLAIMED TO HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED FROM THE ROSWELL CRASH WAS DEVELOPED BY HARD WORKING AMERICANS... AND, A FEW ALIENS!"
3,IS THIS GUY ALIVE OR DEAD AFTER WRITTING THIS BOOK?,"UFO material is usually speculative at best and LT. Cor.Corso has eliminated this a typical UFO trap into a compelling account of the after effects of the Roswell crash. My opinion about the book statrted at the end, near page 262. He reflects on his contributions and involvement with the military's coverup and infusion of alien technologies in fortune 500 companies of the 50's. This might be fact or fiction, but the reality is- if this materail and what he has to write about is of such importance to the american goverment- one has to wonder if this guy is alive or dead? Any beats out there? Good book, boring at times, but I bought it , read it and would recommend it if you really are into learnign about UFO's. Thanks- Spencer"
5,Eye Opening,What a fascinating book! Totally love it and I'm glad I have it in my collection. If this story is true (and I believe it is) then we are in for a shock some day....
1,disappointment,"I really could'nt wait to read this book. I was sure I would learn something new.nope. for someone in the ""know"" he sure is'nt saying anything new. I have read more informative information on the internet and heard more on art bell! this book is nothing but a big tease. I think he must of been planning on writing another book because he alludes to the fact he knows who the aliens are and what their agenda is but never says. this book gives you a tidbit here and there, but, the rest is nothing but space filler about things and events that have nothing to do with the book topic. I can't believe the other people giving this such a high score. it must be their first read on the subject or something."
2,So So,While intersting this book is a difficult read and requires more than one leap of faith if to be believed.
1,Should have been rated zero!,"As a long time researcher in the field of UFO/Roswell, there is only one word to describe this work: excrement"
2,"If it was the truth, it would not have been published.","As the title of this review states, if this was whole truth behind the Roswell incident, the powers that be would not have let this book be published.I believe this book may contain kernels of truth scattered here & there but the potential to spread misinformation through a book such as this is enormous. I'm sure those truly in the know (no, I am not a mad conspiracy theorist!) are always glad when books such as this one are published as they help to further muddy the water and keep us ignorant of what's really happening in this world.An OK book but not the ""truth"", I think."
1,Too lame even for me.,"I have an extremely open mind, but this book is ridiculous! If it weren't for all the self-agrandizing stories Corso tells, it might ring truer; but as it stands, it seems phony"
2,Confused. Skeptical.,"I'm only on page 87 and he says on a trip to London, Frank Wiesner committed suicide by hanging himself. If you google Frank Wiesner it says he committed suicide by placing his sons shotgun to his right temple on his Maryland farm.Why would he get that basic fact wrong? If I checked that fact why wouldn't anyone else?Sadly i'm contiplating putting this book on the shelf. I feel cheated so early into the book.I do believe we have been visited and that Roswell happened, i just don't believe the late Mr. Corso.."
1,Rehash of the X-Files,"Okay, so this guy has rehashed the plot of the X-Files. That does not make it any more real."
2,Started out great.,I thought this was a great book. I was really enjoying the read until the mention of an alien base on the moon. At that point I became dis-interested for the obvious reason.
4,The biggest fallacy lies in the basic story itself!,"Good reading; very thought provoking and compelling. Too bad its not true. The biggest fallacy lies in the basic story itself. Corso leaked alien technology information into private industry during the Cold War. The basic story contradicts itself. Corso himself states in the book that it was important to National Security to keep the crash and the evidence secret from the public and/or Russia. How can you keep technology secret and give it to private industry at the same time? All the details of the book are very interesting by themselves (the trees) but when you look at the ""forest"", the idea of giving the technology to industry to develope does not make sense. How do we know the whole roswell crash was not a ""show"" to spook the Russians during the Cold War era into thinking the US had some sort of technological advantage? The bigger the lie the more people will believe it. Great reading though; very interesting!"
1,An EgoManiac and a Charlatan!,"This was such a disappointing read. For the most devastating rebuttal to Corso's book I suggest you read COSMIC TEST TUBE by an investigative journalist named Fitzgerald. Ironically, Fitzgerald also makes the STRONGEST case I've ever seen for an extraterrestrial event at Roswell. He simply gives both sides of the story, which Corso and his co-author were apparently too greedy to even attempt!"
1,Fantasy and Lies,"After buying a book, it goes into my library. This is one book that did not make the grade. It went into the trash. The gall of this author to credit alien science, rather than the ingenuity and hard work of government and industrial scientists and engineers, for certain advancements in electronics and physics, made me very angry. I had been involved as an observer during the development of most of what Corso credited to alien science. Touted as non-fiction, my description of this book is that it is a pile of words, demented fantasy, and deliberate lies."
3,Short of expectation,"I expected a much newer version. Instead, it was a yellowed paperback that was not inviting to read. I would have returned it, but didn't think it was worth it."
2,suspicious,"I remember reading this some years ago and it seemed strange that one army officer could have access to so many high levels of government and business. What are the odds that one person could be involved, directly or indirectly, in particle beam weapons, microwaves, fiber optics and so on? He said he knew where the bodies were buried, literally, but did not give any details. I thought that it was entertaining but improbable."
5,Corso: An Insider's Story,"I read this book a number of years ago now but I feel it best addresses the question of the Alien presence from someone high up in the circles of both government and military, the liason between them for Ike's administration. This is as credible a witness to the reality of the alien presence as you could ever find, his credentials impeccable in the eyes of those all around him denying the truth of the matter. I see him as one of the true unsung heroes of my lifetime, not afraid to speak the truth of what he knew regardless of the danger of the repercussions. Corso died a mysterious death a few years after this publication, like so many other government coverup whistleblowers before and after him. His son, Philip Corso Jr., now lectures worldwide regarding his father's revelations. I would highly reccommend"
4,CHECK IT OUT FOR YOURSELF,I would recommend this book to people seriously investigating the UFO issue. Get this book and make your own decision. Investigate for yourself. I also recommend Gods of Eden by William Bramely.
4,"Hard to read with pages falling out, poorly glued!","Ordered two paperback copies and am going to Roswell this week. A great guide and extremely credible. Too bad quality of binding so poor. Made reading difficult when turning pages, they were falling out. Second copy bought as gift. Took to local bookbinder who reglued prior to turning pages."
1,"Holy Cow, what a sham!","Corso knows nothing! All the government released documents indicate nothing that would lead one to believe that a UFO crashed at Roswell. There is no evidence in this book that one could examine to see if a UFO crashed at Roswell. THINK! Could the U.S. Government, with civilians who were present at Roswell, hide a UFO? Could the U.S. Government seal the lips of hundreds of people present at Roswell? NO WAY! Corso has nothing. This book is total hype with no evidence (hard fact)."
4,"Interesting, but not complete","An interesting book indeed, but as the old lady used to say, ""Where's the beef?"" Indeed Corso's credentials seem squeaky clean, but the question that he never answers is ""Why are you telling us now?"" With so many references to intimidation by the Army to the witnesses and to people in the know over the last 50 years why can he divulge the unthinkable now?He touches on so many other interesting topics but never delves into them; The Kennedy Assassination, other crashes, communicating with the aliens, and secret bases. His narration never goes deep enough.Anyway it is the most interesting book about Roswell that I have seen in years, and if what he is saying is true Superman can step out of the way for Col. Corso"
2,Too many unanswered questions,"""The Day After Roswell"" by Philip Corso is either one of the most significant books of the 20th century or a complete waste of time. Corso, a former high-ranking military officer, claims that he spearheaded the government's supersecret effort to analyze the wreckage of an alien spacecraft and apply the extraterrestrial technology to US industry. Among other items, fiber optics and integrated circuit chips are allegedly the fruits of Corso's efforts. Corso's account is meticulous but leaves many questions unanswered. The author verifies the existence of the infamous, oft-doubted MJ-12 working group and offers the possibility that the ""aliens"" found at Roswell were in fact time travelers from Earth's own future, raising some bizarre questions: if the ""aliens"" came to 1947 using technology which we in turn injected into contemporary industry, then where--or, more accurately, when--did the technology come from in the first place?"
5,Best Roswell Book,"I have read a number of Roswell books, and Corso's is the best. I'm not sure if it is because I ""want"" to believe him, or he describes things in such detail and awe that you feel like you believe him, but the stories and evidence is interesting nonetheless.Give it a read and decide for yourself."
3,Fascinating report of government cover-up,"I believe in the truthfullness of the author, and believe that our government must tell us of their knowledge of extraterrestrial life in the universe. If you would like to know the real truth about our begininnings then you need look no further. I will tell you our true heritage. Look for my book soon to be published entitled ""The Universe and Beyond"". Carol Granato"
1,"Not worth one star. It is trash, save your money!","Yes, I'd like to believe, and I was fooled into expecting some sort of evidence from this piece of trash. I doubt Corso wrote the book. It is vague, and I believe fraudulent. For someone (Corso) who was supposedly involved in exploiting UFO technology, his involvement amounted to staring at a file cabinet, throwing together some stupid essay of his speculations for his ""boss,"" and then turning over artifacts to others and saying: here, do something with it, get it into products of everyday use. Yeah, sure. I started skimming after a couple of chapters, spot checked other chapters, and tossed it into the trash."
5,"Absolutely fabulous, I couldn't put it down!","Personally, I've always been fascinated by the IDEA of extra-terrestrial intelligence, but have never seen anything in print this convincing...If half this stuff is true, it certainly sheds a new light on political & military policy for the last 50 years...--Nancy Eklun"
5,Very good,The book was received very speedily and was in good condition. I am well pleased and would buy from the seller again.
3,Speechless...,"I really don't know what to think about this book. If it's true, then it's probably the most important book in the world, even more so than the Bible. If it's not--and I must admit this is the more likely scenario--then it's just a sci-fi novel in the guise of non-fiction.Then again, if I had to prove this was a pack of lies, I'd have a hard time doing it. I don't know. I guess I'm just going to wait for the government to come out with the truth before I make up my mind about Corso (I know, and then people in hell will be enjoying tall, cool beverages)."
3,Made for Hollywod,"One has to give Philip Corso the benefit of his credentials and security clearance. The dramatic or poetic opening and closing seems a bit quaint but the environmental dark does swallow you up at night out there in the deserts of New Mexico.There is some circumstantial ""evidence"" put forward, like the cover/contact lens of the aliens eyes that also makes one wonder if he saw the, now exposed, fake alien autopsy movie. Still, it is probable but there is no proof or evidence. Others might argue that much of the technology discussed was already under way by the time of the early 50's and 60's.It is a good read and i find the video interviews with Corso, that i have seen, to be quite credible in his mannerism - reflecting a man of his previous experience and positions. The bottom line, Corso says that there was a vehicle that crashed, and bodies were recovered."
4,Great introduction...now what!!!,"This book seems to be an outline to much more information concerning UFO information. Corso appears to be very credible. However, what is his agenda now? He suggests that we have countered or placed any alien threat into check. However, why do UFO's still appear to this day such as in Phoenix? Tell me more about the lunar base? Tell me more about the religious implications you poked at once or twice. I only hope this is the tip of enormous iceberg!!"
2,Hmmm.......,"I read the other online reviews and decided to spring for the book. While well written, some things jump right out at me. Corso was a career 'militarian' so his opinions appear to come from one angle. What raised doubts in my mind with regards to this book is that there is indeed so much 'dis'-information out there that you don't know who to trust anymore. I can't visualize the wimpy guy in the picture walking into the office of a CIA officer and mkaing threats. Corso insists that visitors mean us(U.S & the world) harm. Yet, in all his wisdom, fails to realize that harm could very well have been done when we were not in a position to defend ourselves. Any rational mind should come to this conclusion, no matter how long one has been fighting wars. Read Alien Agenda. The section on Remote Viewing is very interesting."
2,"Truth, Fiction and Lapses of Memory","I have been a follower of the Roswell Crash for many years. There are excellent books that have been written about the subject. I was excited to find a book that would allow me to follow the ""rest of the story"" through the eyes of someone who was in the know. I was very disappointed to find, what I feel to be, some truth, some fiction and lapses of memory from Corso. The other disappointment came when I read the reviews at this website. If this book is the greatest book ever written to convince people of the existence and coverup of a crash st Roswell, then I urge all of you who think this to expand your horizons."
3,Not an interesting read,"I was so looking forward to this book, but never made it completely though the book. There is so much in the book that is not related to the subject. A lot of background of the author and what he was doing at the time, or what the military or political situation was at the time. I found it boring. A male might find it more interesting, because war stuff is a subject they like."
3,The Day After Roswell,This book was somewhat of a different read for me but I'm glad I read it. I think the Rosewell incident will continue to be a mystery until you read this book. It provides excellent insight on why information from this 1947 occurrance was managed the way it was.
4,"Provides interesting insight, but lacks strong evidence","The strongest point to this book is the detail with which Corso describes his anecdotes. But as anyone can tell you, detail does not necessarily mean the truth.The only choices therefore are: 1) He's telling the truth; 2) He's telling the truth mixed with fiction; 3) He's lying thru his teeth and laughing all the way to the bank. You have to ask yourself, what are the chances of it being the first choice?As it turns out, the detail provides for an interesting and entertaining read. No matter what what you believe, I think you'll find this book worth reading--if you like this kind of stuff.As for me, I just keep an open mind until I have definitive and corroborating evidence--just because I say I saw a UFO doesn't mean I saw one."
1,Doesn't Add Up,"Col. Corso states that in 1961 he was given the Army's most important and secret assignment. After two year of brilliant performance he retired without promotion to 1 star General to take a low-paid job as aide to Sen. Thurmond. He also writes of planning to meet with Jon Von Neumann, who died on February 8, 1957."
3,"Fiber optics = 10 , Solid state data conductance = 0",Fiber optics will be around forever. Most physicists should agree on this. Nobody has been able to think up anything faster than energy in the form of light. The only other method I can come up with is bending space inside out. But this is still limited to the amount of data your system can send and receive. A fiber optic cable of the future will have no limit (except the speed of light and any space a modulated photon occupies). It is likely that alien technolgy would include fiberoptic cables. Corso might know something. But he hasn't said what it is in his book.
1,Talking a lot and saying little,"If you believe in Government cover-ups of just about anything, then you'll believe in the veracity of the situations the author writes about. Aside of several glaring, though minor, technical errors, the writing is dull and overdetailed in some chapters and, occasionally, interesting in others. I did not believe in aliens being recovered at the Roswell crash in 1947, and the author has failed to convince me. Having knowledge of the development of Kevlar (TM), I simply cannot agree that Col (or is it Lt Col, the book jumps back and forth), recovered prototypical specimens from his ""nut file"". I could have spent my money in a better fashion."
5,"This book is for mentally mature people, is not for babies.",I want to congratulate Col. Corso. You have done something we have been waiting for many years. This is the best book on ET. I do know about the ET. since I was a child what you wrote is true.God bless you.Edgardo Torralvo.
3,Tough stuff,"3 and 1/2 stars.Here is the first cd EVER to be released by Seattle's Tooth & Nail record label. You will notice (at least on the original release of this disc, that the number on the spine is 'TND001'). This is a great start for the label that now excels in hard-core/punk/metal music either directly or thru its subsidiary Solid-State Records. This is great heavy music, not metal, but early hard-core. For a trio, these guys have a massive sound-I was lucky enough to catch their last concert ever, and it was amazing. Lots of good grooves here-check it out. At such a low price this is a steal..."
3,Great driving music,"There are some really solid tunes on this record. ""Blood"" is a heart-wrenching song about the singer's friend being killed. ""Fade"", ""Questions"" and ""Ocean"" are other great songs. Don't over think it... put the songs on and feel the groove."
4,Great taste!,"I just had to write in after reading a few negatives on the taste. I've tried a couple yogi teas and wasn't impressed with the taste until I met this one. I LOVE the taste of this tea. It also really feels excellent on a sore throat. I am not a fan of licorice and found that flavor in all the other yogi teas I've tried thus far. This one does not have any licorice flavor. It leaves a minty, menthol aftertaste, which I love.Taste is so subjective...if what I've written entices you, I'd give it a try.Only reason I give it 4 stars is because I haven't yet been able to attest to the immune boosting properties yet."
5,Great Tasting Tea!,Bought this tea for the elderberry included not expecting the best taste. Found that the taste is excellent! I have changed my choice of evening drink from decaf coffee to this great tasting tea. Even my wife has started drinking this instead of her morning coffee.
5,It really works!,"I bought this tea because I had a really bad cold (runny nose, sneezing, watery eyes, scratchy throat, body aches) and I read that Echinacea does wonders for the immune system. I drank three cups of this tea the day that I bought it; it has a sweet flavor and is delicious (and this is coming from a very picky tea-lover!) I woke up the next day completely cured! Coincidence? I think not!"
3,Lackluster,"After reading the first Sex Chronicles, I found this one a little predictable. All the stories seemed to go in the same direction. She should have just done the first book, and left it at that."
3,"They say the second time is the charm, but......","I read the first ""Sex Chronicles"" and it was HOT!!!! But the second time around was somewhat good. My favorite short stories were the one about the wedding where the woman sees her ex getting married, the one where the woman turns herself in but making love to her man one last time and the robbers.However, it didn't seem as hot or stimulating as the first one. I didn't like the one about the actress who was doing research to land a role (not the one with the assistant), I really didn't like the one about the woman who paid so much money for 3 dudes to have sex with her. I really didn't like the Christmas one, it really lost me. Somewhere between sleeping with the co-worker and telling your boss off really didn't do it for me.Just read the first Sex Chronicles is all I have to say."
3,I like her novels better..,"I have read all of Zane's books, novels and anthologies, but the short stories seem kind of repetitive. I much prefer when she applies herself to sticking with one story...like Addicted, Nervous, or Afterburn (by the way is it just me or has there not been the promised Afterburn 2?). If you are looking to read some of her better work look into those or Skyscraper. If you are looking for other authors try Eric Jerome Dickey, Keith Lee Johnson, or this new site I just found that has a free read from a similar author (jenellebooks.com)."
3,This is an How to Guide,"For anyone that does not have an imagination in the bedroom, Zane has given you a full guide! The chronicles are full in detail and leaves nothing to be imagined. I must admit that some of the meetings of these couples are a little far fetched. Good Read."
4,HOT! HOT! HOT!,I loved it! Zane knows how to lay her work down with the pen and paper. She makes some of the hottest stories that you and your lover can enjoy.
3,uhmmm.... just ok,"I don't think this one was as good as the first Sex Chronicles. The stories didn't lead up to a big ""O"" for me in a sense like they did in the first book. But its still worth reading."
2,Give It Up,"I was once again disappointed. The stories are so repetitive. Towards the end of the book, the stories went from being boring to down right filthy!I would never read this to a lover, I was mad that I took the time to read it. This book is going back to the store. The more I read, the more I was wondering if she was giving any thought to these stories or was she just rushing to get a book on shelves.Not a good read."
5,This book is GR8!!,This book is off da chain! I couldnt put the book down once i got started on it! I like this one way better than the first one. Zane keep doing what you do! If you dont have this book you need to hurry up and get it!
4,Wait theres more........,"The Chronicles 2 fit readers with more lovin, although it was not as good as the first chronicle shattering the myth, it is still worth the read and will keep you turning pages."
4,HOT HOT HOT,"This book is a must read for anyone interested in African American Erotica. For single, its great for those lonely nights, for couples it'll spice up the night."
4,Ooooweee... not good for the prudent...,"Good book, has quite a bit of curing and very detailed sex situations. But not a bad book to read for those lonely nights."
4,"Literate and sexy, both - it can be done.","This is my first exposure to Zane, but certianly not my last. It's fun to read, it's well written, and it's the kind of eroticism that both involved are supposed to enjoy - my kind.It's also my first exposure to recent Black American writing. I like even more that it's literate and fun to read. Too much of the popular media time shows off the punk/gangster mess. There isn't nearly enough attention paid to the educated, successful, and pleasant African Americans - the large majority, to judge by the company I keep.I know at least a few people that avoid erotica, based on second-hand opinions of bad writing. This book, if you can coax them to read it, might show them that physical affection, good sex, and enjoyable writing can all be found in one place at one time: here. This book deflates lots of bad stereotypes all at once, and I like having my point of view widened like that.Enjoy!"
5,OFF DA DAMN HOOK,Just like the catergory of her third catergory of short stories! I must say I an a true fan of the author Zane. She is a terrific writer and I can't wait until her next book comes out next year. I bought this book when it first came out and I am finished already. Her stories are heart throbbing and sensual! Heat Seekers was moving and if you liked The Sex Chronicles then you will love Gettin' Buck Wild: Sex Chronicles II. I can't wait to see other readers comments I was glad to be the first. Much love and success on your future writings ZANE!
3,NOT THE BEST,"WELL I HAVE TO SAY THIS BOOK WAS OK IT WASNT AS GOOD,AS THE FIRST ONE SEX CHRONICLES SHATTERING THE MYTH. BUT IT WAS GOOD,I READ ALL OF ZANES BOOKS BUT THIS ONE WAS LIKE A PORNO MOVIE EVERY PAGE WAS SEX, SEX ,SEX ,NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT(DUE TO THE NAME OF THE BOOK)BUT I CANT PUT MY HANDS ON WHAT BOTHERED ME ABOUT THIS BOOK.BUT I WILL SAY THAT THE STORIES WASNT AS INTERESTING AS THE FIRST ONE."
2,If you read part one then no need to read part two.,The stories repeat!!!! Some of them are good and well written but there are at least 2-3 stories that are repeated from the first book.
3,Not what I expected!,I am a fan of Zane. I have read Sex Chronicles I and loved it! I'm not in love with Gettin' Buck Wild: Sex Chronicles II. Part I was way better to me.
4,Zane Delivers,"Imaginative as ever, Zane has crafted a collection of stories that take the reader outside the usual plots one finds in a collection of erotica. Who would have thought of a sexual encounter from the prospective of a female bank robber? Or still communicating arousal in the type of apartment - messy, grungy - that a single black man offers for a sudden adventure to a prissy business woman? In every tale Zane injects the language and perspective of black women which is so uniquely their own. Hot and steamy - sometimes very funny - good writing, a good read!"
3,Fair British B&W movie.,"I saw this movie a long time ago. I especially liked the scene where other inmates told him to take them with him when he escapes and he denies he's going to try to escape - then he vanishes.The scene when he came back and his neighbors wouldn't have anything to do with him was touching, I thought."
5,They Are Everywhere,"Some weird spaceships landed on Spooksville. Adam, Sally and watch go check it but Cindy can't because she sprained her ankle. Sally, adam and watch met gruesome aliens. They even had a friend who's name is EK. EK is a friendly alien. Lately, Adam and watch were izzy and the next thing they knew they were on a spaceship."
2,Pad not new,Received product that was suppose to be new but did not appear new. Sent the product back after calling and emailing to Best Priced Products. They offered to refund my money which was $724. After the first week I called in and left a message and also left a message on their email. It has now been almost 2 weeks and I still have not received a refund for the product. The company has not returned my calls or emails.
5,A Deep Character,"Phoebe is a girl I'd like to have as a friend. She notices. She wonders. She tries to fit the pieces together in order to understand. Besides she likes rocks and minerals, and so do I. In Phoebe's case, rocks and minerals remind her of her cousin who died. Phoebe misses her cousin and when she fingers the stones they collected together, her cousin comes to mind. In this well-crafted story, we follow Phoebe into passages of all kinds, psychological and geological, where dark mysteries may be revealed and healed with time. A very enjoyable read featuring a female heroine worth knowing."
4,Grammer,"It is nice book to read. It is comprehensive, is well written. I guess if you really learned all the facts it will be the only book you need"
3,A comprehensive English Grammar indeed,"a very comprehensive coverage of the twists and turns of English Grammar, but more suited to some one who already has some background knowledge. For instance, one must know the grammatical names for all the parts of speech to fully understand the explanations. With this proviso,though ti is an excellent resource for any serious writer."
5,Great service,"This is my second order and, just like the first, it came promptly and in perfect condition."
4,Covers Everything I will Need,"This book covers most everything you learned in high school and college. It's not too big to carry with you and has a lot of helpful examples. It works very well as a good review for those things you have ""forgotten"" since you went to school. I would buy it again..."
5,Is true to it's name,"This book is absolutely incredible, i found it in my kitchen and I have gotten such great use out of it. In school it cover everything we learn, its inexpensive as well. I really recommend this book, disregard the negative feedback because this book is truly outstanding. It really is the only grammar book you'll ever need!"
1,Misleading title,"If your are a foreign student of English (intermediary or even higher) and arelooking for a GRAMMAR book,than stay away from this work.The title is very much misleading,it is much more of a reference thana full grammar.The subtitle should be used as the title:A One-Stop Source for EveryWriting Assiggnement. This title describe the content exactly,and as suchshould be given a good mark.But as it is,it only misleads.Therefore does not really deserves anything.Stef"
1,NOT The Only Grammar Book You'll Ever Need,"If you want information on how/when to use reflexive pronouns (myself, yourself, etc), and when not to use them, this book won't help you whatsoever. It explains what reflexive pronouns are, but says nothing about usage."
5,The title says it all,"The book is very good and very thorough at explaining nuances of English grammar. It's especially good for those whose first language isn't English, as it explains exactly why certain phrases and rules ""sound better"" than others to native speakers.Combine it with Strunk & White for style, and you'll have everything you'll need to master writing."
5,Grammar Book,This little red book is well laid out well constructed. It contains a small wealth of grammar knowledge. I am currently writing a novel and use this book continuously my coming novel I will be posting for sale on Amazon.My novel: THE ROCK OF NEREID. by Vincent J. Arcuri
2,Not as good as previous ones,"Now don't get me wrong, tre-8 is my favorite rapper and all, but I wasn't too impressed with this cd. Compared to his other ones like ""Frightnight"", ""Ghetto Stories"" and""Dey Scared of Me"", It's really not that good. I really suggest one of the previous three cd's first if you wan't to get one."
5,Best in the West,"This is the best music from Texas I have ever heard. I really enjoy all the songs, especially ""Sometimes"" ,which reminds me of me."
2,Not the same anymore,"I used to love this tea. I would drink it every morning but than the stores I would buy it from stopped selling it, so I decided to buy a case of it on amazon. I don't know what changed, but it is absolutely awful now. It has none of the flavors in it that I use to love so much... and I'll unfortunately probably never buy it again"
3,Disappointed,"I have ordered Yogi Chai Green Tea several times with excellent satisfaction. I ordered the same thing this time but with serious dissapointment, I got Yogi Chai Black tea. I'm sorry I didn't notice the ""Black"" on the invoice that I printed. I feel partly responsible for the error. So I decided to keep the Black because it was at least worth keeping rather than reorder and wait for another delivery."
5,GREAT PRODUCT,This is the best Chai tea I have found. Great flavor. I will certainly purchase these again. They arrived in a reasonable time frame.
1,Disappointed,"I too loved the color of this violin. I purchased it so that I could take lessons with my son. However, it is not worth the price. When I received it, the bow was put in wrong and some of the strings were snapped. The bridge was too thick and kept popping off every time I tried to tune it and the resin was old and dried out. And finally, one of the pegs was poorly constructed and would not tune. Needless to say, I ended up spending money to buy a new bow, resin, bridge and have the peg fixed so I spend the same amount of money I would have had I bought one from a reputable music store. Buyer Beware!"
2,NO.,"Parents, you may be thinking, oh at what a low price it's soo good! NO... it's too good to be true. Buy your kids a more worthwhile instrument if you are going to buy them one here at all. Even though the price is low... it can hinder your child's process and make it harder for them to play. Not only that, but buying a better instrument can get better tone AND has a lesser chance of warping, which can lead to VERY high costs. So really, buy a better instrument and don't think just because the price is right that this is a good violin. There are cheaper violins out there (ie. $150) at places like Shar. *Just a thought*"
4,a must have for mamas and papas fans,"have had the lp for yrs. glad finally able to obtain on cd. if you are a fan of mamas and papas, this is a must have for your collection.too bad so few songs were recorded. the vocals of denny and cassare outstanding. the sound quality of the cd is excellent. this group,perhaps, a little before their time. catchy songs and good harmony.cass has a beautiful voice and her vocals on this cd are rich andvery powerful."
5,What did I do?,"This book is for every knitter that's ever clicked those sticks or is planning to! Wonderful information - and explanations as well. Patterns are well done, hints are timely, and explanations of patterns are well done! Whatever did I do before I had this book???"
1,Beginners Beware,"The projects are cute, but every single project requires seaming. Things like hats and raglan sweaters and knit flat and seamed. Finished bust measurements are not provided, you have to calculate this on your own. Yarns used are very costly and not always easy to find at your local yarn shop. I couldn't recommend this book to anyone who was just starting to knit."
2,hate big needles,"I am not sure anyone looks good in bulky, big needle sweaters- and if you don't like to knit and want it over with, why knit? Take up another craft that you love to do. None of these patterns are attractive and if you are over 18 I don't think you would wear them."
3,A little overboard...,"I have had this book for a few months but still haven't made it past the first few chapters. The author is overwhelming in her way of trying to convince the reader to use dog-friendly dog training. I bought the book because I already agree with this idea and I don't plan on physically abusing my dog, but she goes on and on about how terrible punishment is. I almost started to feel guilty and I don't even have a dog yet! Although this book is not bad at all, I would recommend Puppy Care and Training instead. It also recommends a dog friendly way of training and provides information on care as well. More bang for your buck. I haven't seen any other books that recommend punishment as a way to train a dog (I'm sure there are a few, but I haven't seen them), so the particular emphasis given to it in this book is probably not necessary."
2,Less Than Useful,"Arden is an apologist for the behaviour and reward-based approach to dog training (which she touts as the ""dog-friendly revolution of the next millenium""). She spends more time trashing earlier methods of training than writing a training book of practical relevance."
1,"confusing, confusing, confusing","after reading this book, i was back to square one, but seemed even more confused. i know there are a great number of dog training books, i went on to look for an easier one to understand. people need to knoe that all dogs have different characters, and there must be other methods to use if one doesn't solve the problem."
3,peeing outside rather than inside,"i did not find the book very helpfull as i am having alot of problems with my dog.Pongo is his name and he is a dalmation he wants to do the toliet inside rather than out, for example i take him out a walk and he waits till he is home again then do it in the house and he does it anywhere not just in one place.I have tryed taking him in the garden on a lead and he will look at me then sit down then lie down when he gets bored, i could be in the garden with him for over 30 mins to 45 mins, soon as i bring him in he will pee.could somone please give me some more tips to help me get him to pee and poop outside."
5,Amazing!,I absolutely loved this book! It was very helpful to our family and the dog!!!! It's a true dog-training book.
4,I loved it!,"Okay, it's not their highlight. For my money, I'd go with ""High Gear"" or possibly ""In The Kingdom"". But I did enjoy it. Once Rex Carrol left, the band's sound changed - and I'm sure they were trying to stay up with the changes in the music industry at the time when alternative/grunge/etc hit in the 90's.Of the three post-Rex Carrol albums, this one, Flytrap & Equilibrium, this one is pretty good. I liked Equilibrium a little more and Flytrap is my least favorite Whitecross album overall.Unveiled has a good number of good songs on it like ""Goodbye Cruel World"", and ""Come Into The Light"".I personally think if you like Equilibrium, you will like this album as well."
4,Timely,Product came in a timely fashion- was very well packaged. It was reasonably priced. Would recommend using this vendor again.
3,Delicate Creatures,"There are ten temporary tattoos in this little book from Barbara Steadman, published by Dover. Many of them are heads-and-wings depictions, some are full depictions of cherubs. They actually look a great deal like the pictures in her book Fairies Stickers, which is also extremely pretty. I'd have given it more stars if I liked cherubs, but it's a great value nonetheless."
4,I'm satisfied,Previous reviews were correct; It's a little difficult to fill with water. I don't like the digital display. Black numbers on a grey background are hard to read. But it makes good coffee and quickly. I don't use the permanent filter 'cause it can't absorb the oils in the coffee.
4,Brew,A good coffee maker for a low price. Just set coffee to be ready at a certain time and wake up to hot brew.
3,not bad; poor design,"We have the non-digital version of this machine, #48503. It makes good coffee (don't they all? They heat water and filter wet coffee grounds; how hard it that?) and has a permanent, washable filter. However don't try to get a replacement filter for it. Also the water feeds through a strange design head which is part of the lid. If the coffee is fine ground, the water won't drain fast enough, the head will get covered with grounds and when you lift the lid to dump the grounds/fill with water, these grounds will end up in the water reservoir. The head design also makes filling the reservoir very tricky since there's little space left to pour the water. Just a very dumb design! Finally, their idea of a ""cup"" is about 4 to 6 0z. You won't get 12 ""cups"" of coffee out of this or any other coffeemaker."
1,"Weak coffee, beware","We've had this coffee maker for about a month, and it makes the weakest coffee ever. We have tried ""bolder"" blends, different filters, but from what I've read online, this machine just doesn't make the water hot enough. Not satisfied, especially since we've used every other brand at some point. We are going to splurge on a nice Cuisinart-- I don't know why this coffee maker has so many good reviews!"
2,Great when it works.,"We got this for Christmas. It is wonderful when it works. The first failure happened in January - didn't make it 30 days. The unit would intermittently cut out. I dropped it off for service and they apparently fixed the problem. Earlier this week it ""popped,"" and died again. Now I'm going to SHIP it, at my expense, to Sony's only remaining service center in Laredo, TX. Thankfully the unit has a 2 year warranty, but the shipping cost is a drag. I expect more from Sony. I am disappointed."
2,Subwoofer Output is popping,4 months old and off to the Service center. The sub shut off so I used my back up sub. Same problem. Major pops out the sub channel. I would stay away from this one. When it worked it sounded real good.
4,Sony STR-DE998,"This is an excellent Home Theater Receiver with above average audio controls. I have owned far more expensive equipment and comparitively this receiver with 7.1 channels and an extra set of B channels to power speakers in another zone is an excellent choice. Lots of connectivity options and includes super CD/multichannel audio. Also allows you to listen to different audio sources in separte zones from the same receiver. Priced at $499, this is all you'll need to produce thundering theater sound. Sony, long known for excellence in video, is definitely making a statment among audiophiles."
5,retro & kitsch,"Show off you're gasoline attendant self - but instead of saying ""Bubba,"" you announce not your name, but your creed. You're a geek, and with a shirt with at least one button, you might actually be employed."
2,Watch,"The watch looked ok but the battery was dead, and we could not get the back of the watch off. To top it off, when I returned the watch, I was charged a re-stocking fee when the return wasn't my fault to begin with...not good !"
2,Poorly written,"This book was painful to read.While the book was well organized and in some cases, brilliantly done (e.g.,the literary examination of DDR fiction etc.), the authors' own political biases seeped into her historical analysis like water through old asphalt. The chapter on the DDR's health care system was especially bad. Condemning the British National Health Service and the East German system was especially infuriating, since the two systems were comparative apples and oranges.Utterly absent was any mention of the Kampfgruppen or other (numerous) paramilitary organizations. As with many other works, the Stasi figured prominently.Most obnoxious was her use of paragraph-long, tedious,jargon-laden sentences.One sentence was 119 words in length!Sadly, while this book tried to be the DDR's Grunberger (The Twelve Year Reich), it failed. Stasiland is much,much better."
5,works great!,"This has been working great for my 5 year old daughter to fight yeast. It tastes pretty bad, but I can mix it in her instant oatmeal and she is none the wiser."
3,"Cute, but where are the puppets","This is really cute, but don't be mislead. The photo shows a princess and prince set of puppets, but when it arrived in the mail, the box said that those are actually sold seperately. I am not sure where to get them and I assumed that they came with the theater as shown in the picture. Otherwise, it is really cute, but just plan on buying the puppets too."
3,Cynical View of Seinfeld makes him look good,"Oppenheimer takes a very cynical and negative view on Jerry and his lifestyle but through all of it Jerry just seems to shine through and show how much of a driven and goal-oriented and aloof person Jerry really is. Overall this book gives you insight into who Seinfeld really was. It tries not to talk too much about the show, which is good. You get to know Jerry's childhood, college, and stand-up friends. The author gets many insights from people close to Jerry, but one thing that he never gets is any insight from Larry David or anybody else involved with the show. Not talking about the show is one thing, but those people saw him everyday for nine years, yet they're not included. A very insightful read, if not too specific (A whole chapter is devoted to Jessica Sklar and her growing up and moving and her childhood friends)."
3,It's All In There,"This book had good, reliable sources, and Oppenheimer really did his homework in finding out about Mr. Seinfeld. If you need some info about Jerry, you'll find it here if you find it anywhere...Especially since this book is written from the interesting slant of somebody who may not be so fond of Seinfeld...The only reason this book really gets a passing grade from me is that it's about Seinfeld's life...Seinfeld is a really interesting and quirky guy, so unless you try pretty hard to mess up whatever your writing about him, you'll end up with something interesting.I don't really like Oppenheimer's style--was this book rushed into stores, or what? I counted about 15 typos, and some paragraphs were pointless and fluffy, while others condensed too much into such a small space."
4,gritty road to riches,"The most important thing about this book is that the author conveys to us the hard work and tedious endless preparation and joke revisions Jerry Seinfeld has done over the years to develop a clean act for grownups. It is nice to know that he stuck to it even when college kids and disco dancers ignored him as he performed. He was not an over-night star. I am enjoying the book. I feel a little uneasy with all the innuendo of gayness (not that there's anything wrong with that) the author interjects. But other than that, I find his detailed accounts and multiple quotes fascinating."
5,DO WHAT SEINFELD DID AND YOU WILL BE A MILLIONNAIRE,"I read this to my wife and both of us enjoyed it very much. This tells about Jerry S. from his beginnings to the present day. He has great personal focus on what he wants to accomplish and lets nothing interfere including women and social engagements. It does appear many of the TV shows are most autobiographical and you learn about his friends in real life. To give this book a 1 or 2 star rating is terrible, yet....that is why they make chocolate and vanilla ice cream; all people like different things."
1,Crude tabloid fare,"Boy, does Oppenheimer ever hate Jerry Seinfeld. When I read a biography of a famous person, I certainly expect to be shown stuff that is beyond the media mirage. Their foibles, their screw-ups, their unsavory personality traits, etc. I want a well-rounded bio, showing the person's downs as well as their ups. But Oppenheimer writes like a columnist for The Globe. He includes the most asinine stuff in this bio, stuff that really has little bearing on who Jerry is. His tone is tabloid all the way - he makes unsupported, gossipy conjectures about Jerry's personal life that are shallow and unwarranted. He also only devotes 1 chapter, out of 41, to the show ""Seinfeld"". Nine seasons and a firmly entrenched part of American popular culture, the vehicle that catapulted Jerry to international stardom, gets one lousy chapter? Bleah."
2,Heavy-handed,It seems obvious that Mr. Oppenheimer is no Seinfeld fan. Facts and blatant innuendo are merged into a less than flattering portrait.
1,Irritating and Insipid,"What was the point of this biography, why was it written and why would anyone feel the need to read this book? The last question is obvious, Seinfeld could be called the greatest entertainer of our generation. What i found ironic about this book was the fact that Seinfeld put so much time and effort into his career, and it appears as if the author of this book did no more than conduct three or four brief interviews, and thype sienfeld into a lexus nexus database. What i found irritating about the biography is how the author mention the quotidian nature of seinfelds love life, and then he writes and entire book about his dull and unremarkable lovelife. I dont understand why he chose seinfeld as a subject."
2,I recomend it,"This item is great. Its a nice little assortment of products that my girlfriend and I really got a kick out of. Each item is good for a couple of uses if you are a little sparing with each application so it lasts for several sessions and is a great way for you to try different products produced by Kama Sutra so you can make decisions for later purchases. Kama Sutra is a good company with a variety of different lubes, gels and things you can eat off of each other in an assortment of flavors. I highly recommend it check out their website [...] you wont regret it ;)"
1,ridiculous waste ... don't embrace your ego; observe it.,"there are many well-reasoned 'negative' reviews already, so here's a short summary of my take:Ayn Rand continuously stretches the connotations of words, whether intentionally or not, such that she destabilizes the conceptual foundations upon which rest her imprecisely stated suppositions. Rinse. Repeat.regarding egoism and mind-trap philosophy, all one need do is observe one'e egoic mind.... with continual practice, this technique reveals all. once one realizes the influence of one's egoic mind in real-time... well, no need for hyperbole."
5,Introduction To Objectivist Epistemology,A must read for anyone that is interested in the Objectivist philosophy. Everything about the purchase of this book deserves a five star rating.
5,Ayn Rand is an amazingly lucid thinker.,"Of all Ayn Rand's own expository works that I've yet read, this is the most well-organized. As always, she treats the subject matter with a level of lucidity that I only came to fully appreciate after reading the works of other philosophers. The degree of precision -- and concision -- with which she treats every important topic is simply astounding. Her ability to isolate the essentials of any issue is displayed brilliantly in this book. Her theory of concepts, and her entire philosophy, is groundbreaking.There are those who would detract from her towering achievement based on the questionable behavior of a few of her ""followers""; however, the behavior of individuals has no bearing on the validity of her ideas. I highly recommend this book."
1,Why the long critiques?,"Why does this volume require such long critiques? The simple fact is that Rand blows it from the start.On the very second page of her second chapter, Rand illustrates her theory of concept-formation in what she describes as its simplest case epistemologically: the formation of a child's concept of 'length'. The question-begging nature of this account is obvious on a single reading; she defines length in terms of itself. According to Rand, in order to form the 'concept', we already have to have it.If that case doesn't work, the rest of her theory can't get off the ground. All this stuff about 'necessity' and so forth is interesting, but it's quite needless as a review of *this* book.Rand was no philosopher, and her epistemology was no epistemology. Look elsewhere for enlightenment."
2,Boring,"I purchased this book several months ago, hoping that I could begin a new mystery series. I was wrong. This book was boring and a struggle to finish. The mystery elements had potential, but the book's pacing was too slow. Hobart was uninteresting and Marvia wasn't fleshed out as a character. If you would like an interesting mystery series with an interracial romance thrown in, try the ""Lizzie Stuart"" mysteries by Frankie Y. Bailey."
4,"Short but sweet, The Crabs give us what we're looking for.","The Crabs music is short and sweet. They've got poppy and slower and stuff. A darn good summer album, this stuff is NOT for the R&B crowd, so get lost. Altough the keyboard gets a little high sometimes, and some words get lost in the music, this album rocks. That's all. We love you Olympia! We love you K Records! We love you Jonn, Lisa and Sarah! Viva Les Crabs"
2,Hey! I'm out of Material,"Yuck!Yes, there are some nice things done to other people's music, but overall I'm forced to say, ""Why bother?""If your claim to fame is ""you're a song writer"" then write some songs, It's true ""gold star for robot boy"" would help the total package"" but, as a music listener just go out and buy a Guided by Voices CD, any GBV record...I've done a ton of GBV remakes, I'll give them to you free no charge, am I allowed to say that? (email me) and this CD should be free too. Jon Auer is without a doubt very talented and deserves a listen; try ""frosting on the beater"" for starters, actually anywhere is a better starting place than here."
3,"Not *quite* as awful as I expected, but still...","I'm spoiled on watching subs, apparently, because I've grown to expect a lot from anime in terms of voice acting. This was not a lot.I've heard worse, but this is far from spectacular. Some of the pronunciations gave me pause. However, ignoring the irritatingly monotone drone that is my darling Soubi, I will add that Ritsuka and Yayoi sound decent.....No, really, that's it.I anticipated worse considering the hentai background of some of the voice actors, but this is hardly what I would call an excellent dub.Loveless is my all-time favorite anime, and I purchased this in addition to the collection that I already own as a show of support for a series that I love. That this is a hybrid is the primary reason I'm giving it a generous three."
5,Yay!!,"I'm so happy they finally dubbed this! The voice acting wasn't as bad as I expected, so that's a plus. Also, this seller is great! Super fast shipping and great quality of merchandise. I'd definitely buy from them again! :)"
4,The only anime I fully cried to.,The animation is somewhat outstanding and I am in love with the role of ritsuka because he is just so against love and wants love at the same time.... overall the plot is amazing.
5,One of the best industrial albums ever made!!,"I don't know why this item has no reviews, so I decided to give it one, even though I'm not an expert on it. I was recommended this album by a list of ""best of blah bla"" so I decided to try it - and was not disappointed. The drumming is the finest I've heard in a long time, and song composition/flow are excellent (rather than boring, repetitive, predictable, or pointlessly random and disjointed). The only thing I'm not particularly impressed with is the lyrics and vocals, but even still I find them decent - it could just be a matter of personal preference. If you are into any kind of industrial music, by all means give this album a listen!"
4,The best album nobody seems to know.,"I found this accidentally on cassette in the late 80's and loved it, then found it again finally on CD just a few years ago. I like it so much I own it on vinyl too. Anyway, Some might not think this is so wonderful, but I think it's one of the best pop/rock albums I've ever heard. The songs are truly catchy, some of them rock, some are quite emotional, but they're ALL good. It's too bad Geldof doesn't get as much attention for his music as he does for his concert organizing. Favorites would be ""This Is The World Calling"", ""August Was A Heavy Month"", ""I Cry Too"", and pretty much the last third of the disc. I'd call this a must for any fans of his, or fans of better music from the 80's. Now if this album just had the same cover photo as ""Sex, Age & Death"", it would be 5-star."
5,Awesome! Bought it when it first came out.,I bought this when it first came out when I was based in Germany. I have been trying to buy a first rate quality since my cassette is starting to fail me. Tim
3,Not bad,"Overall this violin is not bad. There were no notches in the bridge and the tailpiece had to be fixed to stay on completely. The sound quality is pretty descent though. For the price I would recommend it to someone who just needs a cheap violin, IF they know how to work on it!"
3,Good Music,This is a great praise and worship CD. I highly recommend any music by the DayStar singers.
3,It's ok,I thought it would have more of the softer old time sounds. I know that the younger people would really like it but being older I prefer the older type music that she does sing on Creation scapes which were beautiful.
5,Highly recommended for the artist and non-artist alike,"An absolutely outstanding book. Even if you are not a potter, the essays are very rich (and the pottery really is beautiful). Like all the rest of you increasingly budget conscious folks, it's rare for me to shell out money for ""coffee table books"" these days but this read is worth its weight in gold. In depth discussions on the creative process, spirituality and what it means to be fully human. I'd highly recommend it to any serious spiritual aspirant, regardless of whether or not you identify yourself as or aspire to be ""an artist""."
4,Beautiful pics,Here is a book written by one of the best American potters that ever lived. It is a classic and has many fantastic photos.
5,My Book is titled... VC# not VC++,"Love this book! I'm a software developer expereienced in c++ now coding in C#. This book is great! It is well thought out and the examples have helped us implement our own solutions.The chapter on GUI Components was excellent. With some modifications we developed a flexible/reuseable Login Component suitable both on the desktop and Compact Framework.Thanks to Jon and John for a great C# book. If you are looking for C++ try another book.One suggestion: republish the link on page 585 in the chapter on Web Services. I cannot connect with the ContentMaster link.Thanks again,Jim Ryan"
1,lackluster (not step by step) or for beginners,"It starts out in the first ten chapters explaining the concepts pretty well, and then it turns into an example-fest without any consideration for its namesake (""step by step""). All the examples are incomplete using ""..."" to signify previously exampled code. Its like a freaking jigsaw puzzle (especially CH 15) unless you have a laptop and are following the source from the cd), but why must you use both? The book itself should be self-contained.I read some other reviews and felt the same criticisms reading it in the book for the first time (especially on the ""ternary operator statement"" from the review by ANT).THE BOOK IS NOT FOR BEGINNERS.I still don't fully understand what struts or interfaces are. In places, it uses allegories instead of definitions. The book is just bad. I think Im writing this review mostly for venting frustration about the amount of time I spent reading it."
1,Definitely Not For Beginners,"It has been a number of years since I touched a programming language, and none of my experience was in Object Oriented stuff. This book has been patently unhelpful. I'm not sure who the audience is - It does not provide much in the way of explanation as to how the architecture works - it just lays it out. It is near useless for a beginner. On the other hand, an experienced programmer is likely to get bored with the ""Open this code and change this line"" approach. Too bad. This could have been a good book. Unfortunately, I don't know if there are any good alternatives if C# is your first language."
2,So Many Errors ...,I am using the first edition of this book and there are so many errors that by the time I was half-way through the book I no longer felt comfortable with any of the sample code. At times I wasn't sure whether I was having a hard time grasping the subject or I just couldn't make sense of it because there were so many errors....
1,confused technical editor,The comments below from Stupified and Jason (the Editor)are both regarding the wrong book. This book is C# and not C++.How can I purchase this book now knowing the editor is less than detail oriented? I must assume the other readers comments are true if the technical editor cannot respond to the correct text.
1,Don&#65533;t waste your money. Don&#65533;t buy this book.,Don't waste your money. Don't buy this book. It is full of mistakes and erroneous presentations. It looks like they never checked the examples against authentic Visual Studio .NET results.
5,Great way to learn C# with useful examples,"This is by far one of the best programming books I have ever bought. The authors explain the C# concepts very well and walk you through examples that not only teach the language concepts but also give you useful programming tips that you will need. For example, the chapter on using Methods gives you an example of the method that shows you how to read input from a console.That said, this is not a beginners programming book. You really need some knowledge of object oriented programming and it helps to be familliar with the Microsoft IDE (either VC++ or VB). If you have some experience with those then this is a great book to learn C#. Also I find the Microsoft Press ""Step By Step"" book much easier to follow then their other reference books."
3,"Not a tutorial almost a text book, more of a referance","This book is detail oriented, and goes into some depth into the structure and capablities of the language.Overall it is well organized and focused with little fluff, and does touch on relavant topics. However, there is little in the way of the 'hands on' projects that can be found in a tutorial or most college textbooks..I found this aspect annoying since this is the primary way I learn. Ultimatley, I will end up using it for a referance"
4,Easy cleaning.,It is a really good and practical product. I liked the dry and the wet cloth. But refills need to be available for purchasing.
3,Hometown Color From a Rising Star,"I studied under Larry Maness when he was first writing this book back in the early 90s. Private eye books are not usually my cup of tea, so it was with trepidation that I encountered this one--and was pleasantly surprised. It is a decent enough story with enough in it to keep the reader guessing ""whodunnit""--with the added benefit of the background of the island of Nantucket. Larry has done a very good job with this first novel, and even I wanted to know more about what was going to happen to Jake and Gloria. The only other private eye books I've ever liked have been Robert B. Parker's ""Spencer"" novels. ""Nantucket Revenge"" is as good as Parker's earlier stories. I recommnd this book to everyone, even if you aren't familiar with the northeast."
1,SLOPPY,"disc is so horrible. This person did not clean well at all. The disc is scratched up and freezes, i cant even watch my tmnt im so furious"
5,Incredible!,"Wow! I could not put the book down! I was amazed at young Gaylen's Journey around the kingdom! I loved the ending. I wonder if Ardis helped him? Anyway my choice for ""delicious"" is brocili with cheese."
5,best book ive eeeveerr read,"This was a very good book. i usually dont like fiction books but i read it anyways and i liked it so much, i read it twice. I highly recomend itTHANK UUUUUU"
4,"If you like fantasy, Search for Delicious is for you!",The Search for Delicious was a great book! It starts out when the king is making a dictionary and they come up to the word delicious. The king said delicious is apples but the court doesn't agree with him so they send Gaylen to poll the towns and find the real meaning of delicious but Hemlock messes it all up. Gaylen meets a lot of interesting people along the way. To find out more about the book you have to read it. I recommend this to all people that like fantasy books and have a good imagination.
2,This was my fave back in the day. I've found better now.,"I bought this BalTogs black nylon spandex catsuit in '98. It was one of my favorite things to wear when I was in the mood for it. But now I've found better.I can find this similar product but with all types of custom sizing and options for the head, hands, feet and the zipper. The BalTogs only has the back zipper which goes to one's mid-back while the new custom ones I have access to allow full access to the ""plumbing"" without having to take it all off.Even better is that I now can get this made in by far more numerous colors and for a forth of the price too. [...]"
5,"Funny, moving story of return to faith","Carol Orsborn movingly describes her return to the faith of her childhood, Judaism. No sentimental hash here; this spiritual renewal came through study and hard work while Orsborn was a student at the Vanderbilt University Divinity School. She paints a very realistic picture of the current state of education in university-related divinity schools, and the composite characters she uses are sometimes howlingly funny (and familiar). This is not just a book for Jews; anyone hoping to make peace with the faith of his or her early years will find in this book a helpful, hopeful story. I have loaned it to several members of my church who are struggling with Christianity. What is important for me and the readers I know is not so much the faith to which Orsborn returns, but the journey she makes. That journey can be universal."
3,Charger has some irritations,"The safety timer and beeper on this charger are very irritating. By default, the safety timer is set to only 90 minutes, which assumes that you are fast charging your battery at a higher rate in order to finish before the timer sets off. Any changes to the max timeout are lost whenever you select a new battery technology, or if you power cycle the charger.When the timer expires, the charger sits there beeping its brains out, until you hit the left button to kill it. My wife dislikes all of the beeping.I find the TP610C from Thunder Power RC much quieter, and less frustrating. Plus it has Lipo balancing built in. Plus, you can purchase a USB interface and update the charger's firmware. Great Planes does not seem to support doing that."
4,Candle Making in a Weekend,"Colorful and practical. This book has great ideas for decorative candles. Each idea has step by step instructions (as well as pictures so you can double check your work) for basic techniques that stand alone or can be combined with others to make more elaborate candles.This is a book of projects. If you're looking for a history of the techniques/materials used to create these candles you won't get it. But if you want quick ideas without alot of informational interference, this is it."
2,Couldn't Do it,"This one didn't do it for me. I really wanted to like this, being such a fan of the first film. The acting in the film is okay, but it suffers so much compared to the Pacino/Penn film. The climax was very bland. The one thing I wish they would have explained better was how Carlito became friends with the Italian mobster and the African American bookie. They were both very successful people in their own circles, and Carlito was just a common care thief. Why would they cut him in as an equal partner in a tens of million dollar drug business? Also, how did all three get in one cell. This takes place in a time when racial tensions are high, and prison officials would not have put a white/African American and Hispanic in the same cell. And while everyone else in the film hates each other for being differant, these three love each other. I would have liked to see the story of how they got that way. I would steer clear of this one."
1,Rise to Power is Rise to Nothing,"This is one of the worst films of 2005, a prequel that is almost as bad as dumb and dumberer and son of the mask, the acting is terrible especially P. Diddy's performance, the screenplay is a mess, the cinematography is ridiculous and the violence is bloody, sickening and silly.This is not as good as al pacino was in 1993.I Hated this film."
1,hahaha,"Once again in fantasyland we go with fake ""gangstas"".P diddo or diddity, pifily poof what ever his name is this week.This movie is not worth the price of the plastic used to make it.the established italian mobsters would not put a black or puerto rican on equel footing.these guys would not share the same area in the joint.ridiculous!!!when it comes to TRUE GANGSTERS there are serious racial/ethnic barriers.That is just the facts.As much as the mass media tries to rewrite history it still doesnt change it."
1,Made for ignorant ghetto gangsta' proteges,"There is so much to say about this movie. The best had to be when Puffy's character claims that the Italian Mob won't dare set foot in Harlem. This, of course, is the furthest thing from the truth. Sure, Nicky Barns was a legendary black gangster, but what does he have to do with Carlito's Way? Are you kidding me; who on Earth decided to throw a Nicky Barns character in here?In the original Carlito's Way it is stated that Carlito came up in the 50's. The original also takes place in the seventies. That being the case, why on Earth does Rise to Power also take place in the 70's... especially when it is known that Carlito went away for 5 years to begin with? The bottom line is that this movie was pure garbage but worth watching maybe once for a good laugh."
1,What happened?,"No wonder this release went straight to dvd. The original Carlito's Way is one of my top 3 movies and this is one BIG disappointment. A big majority of the movie I got the feeling like the actors were just standing on screen waiting to say their lines. PDiddy as Hollywood is awful, that is some of the worst acting I have ever seen, especially in the scene where he shoots the guy in the bar. I felt like tossing the dvd out the window by this time and this so called prequel does not connect in anyway to the original. I was waiting for an apperance by Lalin or Pachanga. This movie is a desperate rental if there is nothing better to rent available. My copy is heading off to Ebay."
3,Benny Blanco From the Bronx.,"Instead of focusing on recreating a classic they should've focused on the real Latino who rose to power in Carlito's Way, Benny Blanco from the Bronx. John Leguizamo (Benny Blanco) is a great drama actor with his credit in Empire. Part 2 would not had gone to video should it follow that format. However, the name sake of Carlito's Way will sell to even those skeptical just to see if it could be done. I gather that the remake will be nothing short of entertaining but not creating a part 2 with Benny Blanco is a sad oversight for Hollywood.Dear Hollywood,Know your audience.Sincerely,Danimal"
2,A noteworthy Effort,"My Grandfather says that nothing beats a failure but a try. Well, they tired to make something out of a classic. The supporting characters were ok, but Jay Hernandez as Carlito was confusing, his role was not defined nor lucid. I understand this was a prequel but even in a prequel you setup the sequel (see Indiana Jones and Star Wars). This did not setup anything, it was more convoluted than one could imagine.I am from Chicago grew up in the inner city, saw thugs, drugs, shootings, the whole nine yards and I have learned not to celebrate any of that culture. For those wannabe gangsters who have turned Tony Montana into the Pope of Crime this will serve them well. For those of us who enjoy great story-telling such as the GodFather, Carlito's Way, Once Upon a Time in America, American Me, A Gathering of Old Men and others like these titles we will not particularly care for this film."
3,"""A"" for effort ""C"" for content.","Having not too long seen the original ""Carlito's Way"". The common expression of this movie would be a negative one, however, I sense that the budget is low for this film even with Sean Combs as the draw for it. I mean I have to be honest, if you're going to follow up on Al Pacino; a definite movie legend, you better have your stuff together. It's entertaining for someone who perhaps didn't see the original. Somehow the movie pieces together some sort of chemistry with Jay Hernandez's character and the supporting cast from Sean Combs to the ""dirty cops"" in the film. I wouldn't suggest this film would make it to the upper crust of ""gangsta"" films, but it is mildly entertaining to the ""non-gangsta's"" eye. Kudos to a previous reviewer; this film really should of been a TV movie. But hell, the way movie/dvd turnover ratio are these days....Who would care, considering most flicks make their money on dvd sales."
2,Rent it,"This movie doesn't hold a candle to the original Carlito's Way. Not even in the same ballpark. First off, aside from Luis Guzman as Nacho Reyes, the acting was pitiful. Jay Hernandez did not play a believable Carlito at all. He was way to soft to play the Carlito that Pacino created, and didn't come across at all like the hardened criminal that he should have. Plus the rest of the C-List actors chosen to play the supporting cast were just as bad. The movie also did very little to tie itself to the original. And finally, they just didn't do a good job of bringing back the time period. The look and feel was off, it needed the look of Dead Presidents to pull it off in my eyes. 2 stars, I'm taking my copy I bought yesterday straight back to sell as used..."
2,WTF?,"DISCLAIMER: Don't read this unless you've seen the movie .... The movie was going along well, entertaining until the ""Harlem Nights-esque"" ending. Not believable at all, also where was Gail? Who's this chick? And getting away to the islands? It was making sense that he had a friend who went down there, totally connected with the original ... but when Carlito went it ruined it? Retired? How does he go to jail? Unanswered questions that i was expecting to be revealed in this one. The only part i thought connected very well with the original was Luis Guzman and his ""this loyalty you have for your friends is going to get you killed one day"" line. All in all it would have been a 4 had the ending not strayed, and he stayed in the streets so atleast him going to jail would've been assumed, instead we were left guessing .. when does he leave the island? Oh well, judge for yourself, i had to vent."
1,HD DVD,This DVD was supposed to play on HD player or standard. Won't play on Standard and I have Blu-Ray so I don't know what it's like.
3,Story line?,"I loved the original movie and know most of it by heart. My boyfriend is also huge fan of the original, but we were kind of disapointed with this movie. The story is a very good story, but trying to create it as the begining of Carlito's rise to power really didn't work. I'd like to know where some of the characters from the original are. Where is Dave Klinefeild? Gail? or anyone else from the original who were with Carlito before he went to jail. He has new friends, and a new romance. This story line doesn't follow the original. It's a good story, but if you want to follow the story line this movie isn't it."
2,HMMM ... Don't know ... Enough with the killing and death,I am tired of the same old depressing movies. I know this was done a while ago.. but please no more kill/murder/suicides... jeez... the young lesbians might think we are all demented.
2,Stops Grinding - But gumline receding gums,"I bought the SleepRight night guard after losing my dentist-made guard. At first, I was really happy with it. I slept a lot better and did not wake up with a pounding headache. However, I started to notice that my gum line was receding. My gums bleed more when brushing and were generally more sensitive. I stopped using it. Then, I asked my dentist how much another professionally made guard would be - $480!!! I can't afford that right now and need to find another over-the-counter guard - won't be using SleepRight as I want to keep my gum line!"
1,"Too expensive, bad design","I've used several types of dental guards, including custom-fit by my dentist, and was hopeful that this would be a relatively inexpensive alternative. The first night I followed the directions and all seemed well..until 5 a.m., when I woke up in excruciating pain. The guard was wedged under my gumline, pressing on a nerve. I adjusted it and went back to sleep...but had the same dreadful experience 2 hours later. I've never had this problem with another dental guard. I won't be using it again, and I couldn't recommend it to anyone else."
3,Worth a shot if you won't go to the dentist.,Not a bad product. Seems to be holding out fine. Does not feel like it fits my mouth correctly but it is an akward product by nature so I don't expect it to fit like it was made for my mouth. Hard to get used to having it in my mouth while trying to sleep but after a few nights I got used to it and my jaw was being trained not to clench. All in all a good product if you can't or won't go to the dentist for a custom mouthpiece.
3,Teeth Guard,"Product seems to be well built.The fact that we did not kown it should not be used by a person having TMJ, cause us to have to return it."
4,So far so good,"My husband has been using this for 1 week+, to prevent grinding his teeth at night. He had tried a cheaper $30 home fitted night guard that he could never get to fit right (required boiling etc.). This one is more expensive, but very simple, no boiling or fitting involved. It takes a little getting used to, but the brochure that comes with it goes over that, and encourages users to put it in 30 minutes before bed each night to become accustomed to it. And hey, it's alot cheaper than the $900 system the dentist wanted to fit him with!"
4,Good Buy,I grind and clench my teeth a great deal. I have been wearing a night guard from the dentist for 20 some years but still had trouble since the night guard from the dentist did not help my clenching of the teeth. This is my second one. The first one I wore every night and wore it out within a year. The second one I purchased I wear every couple nights and it is holding up well. You don't need it every night. My jaw has not been sore like it was with the night guard from the dentist. I should not crack any more of my teeth while using this night guard.
2,"Don't just protect your teeth, protect your jaw","I tried an off the shelf mouthpiece. Then I tried a $400 custom made mouthpiece from the dentist (he claimed since it was hard I wouldn't chew and grind so much) but ANYTHING in my mouth made me chew harder. Now I'm using a biofeedback device that is a headband -- it's not in my mouth. It hasn't ""cured"" me -- if I quit wearing it for a few nights I start grinding again, but I feel much better in the morning when I wear it -- my jaw doesn't hurt."
1,Sleep Right,Sleep Right??? I couldn't sleep at all with this device in my mouth. It doesn't stay in place. It was horrible. I went back to my old stand-by sports mouth guard.
5,Better then the one the dentist made,i have had a custom night guard made by the dentist and i would wake up in the middle of the night with such a headache i would throw it across the room.. with this night guard i wake up and it's still in my mouth in the morning and no headache.....and i buy the one for petite mouths...the slim-fit....it works the best...i think
5,Sleep Right Night Guard,"This is a great product for those that deal with grinding issues. More convenient than those night guards that need to be boiled. It has adjustable settings. It helps to keep the teeth separated without touching, unlike most night guards that fit over your entire row of teeth, leaving pressure and soreness in the morning.I would highly recommend it to those that are seeking relief from night grinding."
4,It does work,"In some ways, this is more comfortable than the mouth guard I got from my dentist because it doesn't cover all my lower teeth. In other ways, it's less comfortable because it's very flexible and can move out of place. I do like the adjustable sides, though. Overall, I'm happy with it because it's a lot less expensive than a custom-fitted dental device. And it does keep me from biting down on my teeth at night, which means I no longer am waking with a sore jaw. The minty flavor was pretty apparent at first, but now I hardly know it's there. So it really doesn't matter what flavor you buy."
1,Caused Blisters inside my cheek and made teeth hurt.,I didn't have a problem sleeping with the nite guard or having it fit right. What I had a severe problem with is when I woke up I had pocket blisters all inside my cheek on each side from the nite guard and my teeth hurt. I took it back to the store and they refunded my money.
1,JUNK: TCJ doesn't care about manga,This is a pitifully obvious attempt to CASH in on the manga craze. The Comics Journal never covered manga until recently and mostly just scoffed at it. Now they have a huge book supposedly devoted to it. Yet the COMICS SECTION features a bunch of indy cartoonists and TCJ regulars who don't draw manga at all!!With the exception of Tezuka the artists covered here are not terribly noteworthy in the scene as a whole and just further the feeling that they just slapped this book together to drain some wallets and ride the trend.This is just another crass attempt to cash in by a snobby magazine that has traded its elitism in for pure greed.
4,4 Star rating,This is a very informative book. There are a lot of ultrasound images for pathologies. The quality of the US images are acceptable. I would have given this book a 5 star rating had it not been because some of the pictures are too dark while some are too bright. Or maybe it's just because the images were not taken in harmonics setting. I can't wait until they revise this book with higher quality US pictures.
1,NOT A GOOD BOOK,"I used this book when I was a student, and I hated it. Every paragraph was lengthy and it made me MORE confused. I felt like I was reading War and Peace. I remembered nothing from reading it. I would save your money on this book and buy the two volume set called Textbook Of Diagnostic Ultrasonography by Sandra Hagen Ansert. That is so much better, and worth your money."
5,"Mercedes Lackey has done it again, an extremely good read.","When I first heard that Mercedes Lackey was coming out with a new ""Valdemar"" novel, I was excited, then after some long contemplation, and reading some of her recent books, I had doubts. I bought it, read it, loved it. Though at the beginning, I couldn't stand Darian, he was such a brat, no wonder the folk of Errolds grove looked down at him. Then when the barbarians came, and invaded Errolds Grove, and Justyn killed himseif trying to save the town, I started to have a little more compassion for Darian.I won't go into more detail, for there might be readers out there who want to read it, and find out the rest of this wonderful book for themselves. So do yourself a favor, buy this book, and you will be suprised!!!"
2,"Entertaining, but not up to par","I am a huge fan of Mercedes Lackey, especially the Valdemar novels, but I have no desire to continue this trilogy. I was entertained, yes, because I like the book's setting. However, I found myself not really caring what happened to the characters. (Very atypical of a Lackey novel. Including the Gryphon series, which was also co-written with Larry Dixon.) This might not be a bad place to start the Valdemar novels, but I would reccommend starting with ""Arrows of the Queen."""
2,Not up to her usual standards....,"Mercedes Lackey is one of my favorite authors - her books are, on the whole, wonderful. Not deeply philosophical or anything, but great, creative fantasy. Reading that is relatively light, but still of high quality. Understandable and high-quality and yummy for teenagers and adults alike. In general. Owlflight, however, is really not. It feels like it was aimed strictly at kids age, maybe 8-12. Honestly, that really got to me. It felt almost like it should've been called ""A children's guide to Valdemar"". It was better then a lot of ""young adult"" fantasy - but not at ALL up to her usual standards. Please, please, if you want to read her books, PLEASE read other ones instead. The Last-Herald Mage trilogy is wonderful, as is the Mage Winds trilogy, Bardic Voices, etc."
4,Very cool. I thoroughly enjoyed this book,"This is NOT a stand alone book. It is the first book in a new Valdemar trilogy, beginning with Owlsight. An excellent novel, if a little bit juvenille. A bit like Arrows of the Queen in writing style, but lacks in no area. Owlsight (the sequel), is more involved, but this book is a necessary prequel. I am anxiously awaiting Owlknight (the final volume), and having read all the Valdemar novels thus far, this series rates up there with the Mage Storms for entertainment value."
4,I didn't want to put it down,"One of Misty's best Valdemar stories, possibly because it did not deal with the powerful and highborn. Following Darian from an angry, insecure, child to a confident hawk brother ready to train as a mage, then as a silver was an interesting view into the human psyche.We got to meet all the races we have become used to as the population of Valdemar, but learning the personality of each new character was great. I personally have loved all of the previous stories put out, but there always seemd to be a connection of some sort to Vanyel or Skan, it was refreshing to meet characters who had only heard of the famous Elspeth or Firesong, but weren't related in any way.<P"
2,"Disappointing, not her usual quality.","Mercedes could have eliminated about 50 pages of Darien's repeated whining and excuses in the beginning and it would have been a 4 or 5 star book. Good basic idea, skim alot of the beginning50-75 pages, the get to the good read."
2,Is that all???,"I have read all of Lackey's work, and Misty's work seems to be getting simpler. The plot of Owlflight proves to be predictable from start to finish. This reader was left looking for more to squeeze out of the plot, unsatisfied with the simplistic telling of the story. It wasn't just the plot's fault... somehow, Lackey's and Dixon's language has changed. There's a different feel and tone to the novel as compared to Lackey's earlier Velgarth series' of the Last Herald-Mage, or of The Heralds of Valdemar trilogy"
3,OWLFLIGHT Doesn't Soar,"I haven't read Mercedes Lackey for a few years, but this one looked interesting. OWLFLIGHT is an adequate story, but is still too heavy on the exposition, drumming in the same outlook time and again. I wonder if she (they, she and Larry Dixon, co author) doesn't have another story to tell other than the misunderstood-kid-finding-his-magical-niche."
5,Wonderful!,"As an owner of every one of Mercedes Lackey's books on the Valdemar Timeline, I must say that this and Owlsight rank up there with all the others! I give every one of her books five stars, and want to tell her that she has thousands of fans. I felt very connected to Darian and Keisha (Owlsight). I can't wait for Owlknight to come out so that I can snatch it off the shelf. Congrats on another winning trilogy, Ms. Lackey!"
1,How did this get published?,"Okay, theres really not much to say about this book other then well...it was just bad. The characters were one dimentional and annoying and the plot was simple and boring. Somehow I got through it, thinking it had to get better. I was wrong, the second one was even worse and I finally had to just stop not even half way through. I hear that not all of ML's books are this bad, and I'm willing to forgive her this one transgression and accept that as true. Either way, I won't be reading anything else by her."
4,"Good, but a little redundant","I thought the book was good, but there were some parts that were repeated, but from different views- it got me a bit confused, expecially for a 12 year old. I would recommend reading the ""black Gryphon"" or her other books to get used to her style of writing and avoid getting confused."
3,Could be Better,"In this novel by Mercedes Lackey, a young orphan unwillingly Gifted with magic, sees his village demolished by barbaric men. Escaping into the Pelgaris Forest, Darian meets up with the legendary Hawkpeople, who help him overcome his pent-up grief. In my opinion, Darian overcomes his sorrow a bit too fast. In the beginning, Lackey makes an enormous deal about how tragic Darian is, and how misunderstood his entire life was. After a few days with the Hawkpeople, he seems as happy as you could wish. However, the plot is good (if not a little faulty) and the characters are usually quite convincing, especially the gryphon Kel. But I know Lackey has written better novels than this before."
5,i really liked this book,"I enjoyed this book a great deal. It is not the kind of book taht requires a great deal of serious thought, if you are looking for that, go for Patricia McKillip. This book is an enjoyable read and shows how events mold people into completely differnt personalities, espeacily when read in conjunction with the other two books in this series."
4,Disagreeing with the other reviews,"I'm 34 years old, and have read all but one of her books in the Valdermar series. I've enjoyed them all very much. Yes she has a set theme that she uses in all her books, but the charcters in each of her books have their own personality and she makes each and everyone of them come to life. In this book Owlflight, and the sequal Owlsight Darnin is brought to life in such away that when he thinks his parents have died you have no promblem feeling his grief."
4,Very satisfied son!,"My son is doing a project for school based on the Deltora series. He was so excited to see what the characters and monsters were actually suppose to look like compared to what he had imagined. He is really enjoying the book. To me, the book seemed a little pricey for what we got, but because he was happy, it was worth it."
5,deltra,It arrived on time and in good condistion. he really like it better then he thought he would. At a good price.
4,Escape Back to Childhood,"Remember a time when life was less complicated? A time when you could play more and work less. A time when you learned valuable lessons from family members and created happy memories with friends. Now you can revel in that time, while reading The Pottsville Chronicles with your children. Join sixth grader, Alexander, and his family as they begin a new life in the town of Pottsville. Change is never easy. However, Alexander meets some very special people who help him understand the importance of being true to yourself and others. While he is learning this valuable lesson, his sister Joey is learning some lessons of her own!Thank goodness she has a patient and loving mother to help her find her way as a five-year-old. This book is a classic feel good story that all children can relate to. The language is simple, but it creates such wonderful pictures in your mind. So, pull up a cozy chair and escape back to childhood."
2,Misrepresented,"Although the description now acknowledges that this outfit does not fit American Girl dolls, the original marketing of the dress indicated that it would. The material is beautiful, but the dress is a bit complicated for little hands, and of course the fact that it did not fit my daughter's doll caused great disappointment. While I appreciate that Amazon has now corrected the description, it did no good for those of us who bought the misrepresented outfit."
3,Roller Shoes Retractable 4 Wheels,"The shoes are a bit large, but we are used to the Heeley's. My daughter likes them. It's just more difficult to retract the wheels, but again she is still enjoying them quite a bit."
3,Good for what it is,Granddaughter loves them but find that it is hard to use on concrete because of the hard wheels.
3,Teaching yourself Gaelic,"It is a great book if you already know how to pronounce the words, but if you don't, I would not recommed this book. If you do, it's wonderful. Lots of gaelic names and places and simple phrases to say. Would be very helpful in Scotland or Ireland, even to just look up the word."
3,a little narrow,"I love the looks of this shoe they are just very narrow. I'm hoping to stretch them a bit so that they are more comfortable, like I expect a moccasin to be."
4,Cool and Easy,"This is very easy to use and it has lots of good textures. I have made lots of amazing stuff because of this software. I made good details to my models. But it doesn't have a IK stucture. When I tried to make charcters to my models, it is colorful, but when I tried to animate it, it doesn't move like real charcters. But it is cool that I can make my own movies and animations. But sometimes it takes long time to render. Although this pruduct is easy to use. GET IT!"
5,Excelente Disco,Lo he visto con mi padre y hemos quedado fascinados con la elaboración. Estost tipos siguen tocando como antes.
2,Not as Varied as Expected,"I was excited that this book was in color and could not wait to recieve it, but was very disappointed. Not only did all the fabrics seem similar, but I felt the patterns were not very different from one example to the next."
3,Good but Buggy,"I've used several webbuiilders , everything from Adobe to Frontpage and found that Web Page Construction in the easiest to use. Quickly make buttons and layout and your on your way, but, I've found that it crashes for no reason from time to time Plus you have to copy and past from the menu bar. Yet, i still think it's one of the best out there for people just starting out on the web."
4,The best part of this package is WebExpress 4,"I like this package but the crown jewel is definately Microvision's WebExpress 4 which is bundled as part of the package. This is one of the best HTML programs that I have ever used and offers excellent site management capabilities. If you are looking for a top quality but affordable program, you can't go wrong with this. The rest of the programs aren't as good but WebExpress makes up for it."
2,low end speakers,Not a good replacement for Toyota Avalon JBL Speaker 86160-AC180 rear woofer 86160 - 26W and 3.7 OHM.The sound quality is poor.
5,One of the best overviews of labor and employment law!,"Rebecca Hanner White provides a clear and concise overview of labor and employment law terms and concepts, ranging from traditional employment law principles to those developed under modern, federal statutory employment discrimination law. This handbook is appropriate and valuable for everybody - from legal practitioners to college and law students to individuals wishing to understand more about the legal framework for employment in the United States. Everybody should read and review it for both general understanding and as a starting point for more focused study. This book is a jewel of a find!"
1,HORRIBLE DO NOT BUY,"This is a horrible, how quality violin and the shipper is not a company that wants to work with their customers to help resolve any problems with shipping damages or anything else."
3,Too greasy for my sensitive skin,"I purchased the eb5 Gift set which includes the facial cream, cleansing formula, and toning formula.The cleansing formula gave me a hot sensation after washing my face the first time. I didn't think much of it and then the facial cream is too oily for my face almost feels as if I poured oil on my face. The toner was the only good thing out of this entire set. Unfortunately these products are not for me. That's great other people can benefit from these products. Maybe its only good for those with non sensitive skin and if your skin is dry."
5,Love this Product,"I have used this product for at least five (5) years. I am 70+ and when I tell someone that they go ""No Way"".The facial cream is not too heavy and not too light. It makes your skin feel supple. the toning formula is perfect before you apply the facial cream.I would recommend this product to anyone."
1,This EB5 products have a bad quality.,"Looks good but taste no good.Looks nice but the quality of EB5 is bad.The cream ( for eyes and face ) is quite different compare to another product.I do not like those.After using this products for a fews days, my skin has been changed. Itching and appear many red spots.I bought this because of the Ad. , so I try.I will never touch or buy that Items from EB5.If somebody think this products is good or want to prove, I can sell to them with a lower price, because I just use a little ( few days )."
3,Like the cleanser,"I don't like the cream in this package. It is too oily and I blame it for my break-outs -- at age 60 -- God forbid, the ONLY positive thing about aging. I have seen EB5 advertised for years in my local newspaper and could not resist Amazon's price to try it out. I like the cleanser and the toner, but would not recommend the moisturizer/cream because of the results I experienced."
4,Best price on Eb5 products on Amazon !,I have been using the Eb5 for about a year now. So far I really like it. It really looks good under your foundation makeup. I use it everyday. Also looks good on my face when not wearing foundation. I have a couple of friends that have been using it for years now and they both wouldn't buy anything else. Amazon always has the best prices on Eb5.
2,eb5 Gift Set,"This product was a good price for what you got, but I was not impressed with any noticable results as was advertised by this company."
1,Nice when it works,"This is NOT a review of Amazon, but a review of the bulb. I bought four of the #9266 lights which each came with a 9166B bulb. All of them worked when I first installed them, but a week later one of the lights quit working. I swapped bulbs between two of the units and determined that the bulb was bad. For as expensive as these things are I expect them to be more reliable. I've had similar disappointments with other fluorescent lights from Lights of America. Considering that the lights are made in China, why do they have this name? The only way I can see to get a reliable light is to buy several and throw away the bad ones. Not very cost effective. I wish somebody else made these things.As for the claim that they put out the equivalent of 500W, I used these to replace four 400W metal halide lights. There is no way these put out as much light as my old lights, but I am glad to be rid of the high electric consumption and the buzzing."
1,Different specs...,Used the codes off the original bulb which matched this bulb however the screwbase was the wrong size...could be a manufacture's issue however it became a buyer's issue.
1,bulb blew,"I had the bulb for about a month, but it was on for only about 25 hours, altogether, and I recently realized it was not working. Now I will try to get a replacement."
1,Poor Shiping,"The product was never delivered. When I called to inquire about my order I was informed that it was delivered on April 30, 2010. I was also told by a ""customer service rep"" that there was nothing he could do to help me and I should contact the USPS in my town to check on the delivery. I don't know what this company thinks customer service is? But I know that if this is the way I ran my customer service for my customers, I would be out of business. I know I will never do business with this merchant again."
4,bulb is solid so far,"I purchased this bulb with the fixture, it has been on 24/7 for the last few months with no isses. Ive dropped it from about 5 feet on carpet with no cover and it didnt even flicker. They either improved there build quality or i got very lucky."
3,"Might've been great, but I'll never know","I can't really review this item, because I never really got to use it -- the bulb was actually physically too big for my lamp, something that wasn't made all that clear in the product description. I'm sure it would have been fine, as the previous LoA items have proven to be more than satisfactory.My only small issue is with the amount of time it took to get a refund for this product. I sent this back the day after I received it, and I didn't receive a refund for more than three weeks. They also never answered my four attempts at finding out the status of the refund. But I eventually got the refund, and all was well. So, my score here should really me ""N/A,"" but since that wasn't a choice, I'll give it the average 3 of 5 stars. And I will still order from them again."
4,Best Cornbugs Album,"Choptop,Travis,BUCKETHEAD,Pinchface This is 1 of 3 Greatest Hits (sort of)it has most of its songs from other albums but some sound different. This is my favorite of the 3, and of any of there first albums. It's a good buy and the cheapest I've seen (I don't know why it costs a lot), but still worth it and essencial for Buckethead fans. The style is a slightly psychotic comedic rock style, unique sound you only get from Cornbugs."
4,A must have for any Todd Fan!,A must have for any Todd Fan. If this is your first exposure to Todd you will not appriciate it as much. A good sample of Todd live.
5,"The energy boost is real, and the flavor was pretty good.","I just received this today in the mail, and tried out my first cup. Much to my surprise, the taste was very good, and I hardly needed any sweetener to actually drink it. This has spearmint and kombucha in it, and I don't know what major effect those had on the tea overall, but I'm fully aware of additional benefits it can provide. I actually like this way better than the Celestial Seasonings green tea. This tastes more authentic and it's organic which is a big thing for me. I'll definitely have to recommend this to anyone I know who drinks green tea. So far, so good with this one. Thanks Amazon for carrying this."
2,Works as advertised but disgusting,"This tea does have a good blend of caffine and herbs which wake you up, but seriously... It is disgusting... It smells terrible (and I love the smell of tea) and tastes just as bad..."
1,BT2,Was really looking forward to trying this tea and expected to love it. I brewed it and was unsure as to the aroma and strong coloration. Sipped it once and never went back for more. My husband did the same thing. The taste is terrible. Threw the whole thing out. Yuck!
5,Love this tea,"I love this tea. It really does give a decent pick-me-up in the morning. Sometimes if I'm exhausted I'll drink two cups, but the great thing is I never feel guilty about it since it's a healthier option than coffee. The taste is pleasant - definitely not overwhelming. I think anyone who drinks green tea already would get used to it very quickly."
4,Pretty Good,"The Book is pretty good. It is the second Nacy Drew Book that I have read. It is a really good mystery. It takes a while to get into it though. So just keep reading and it will adventually get better. The book is very ""twisty"" though. You will on one subject then it will jump to another then another. But you just need to make sure that you understand everything or eltes you will be allmixed up"
1,STOP,"The only thing that gets you is the cover. So unless you want to throw money away, don't buy it. This book was recommended to me...LOL ~GARBAGE!"
5,Real Life Galore,If you're in a relationship...read this book. If you're looking for a relationship...read this book. Rich Gilmore was on point with this one. There has to be a sequel. A Star Is Born!
2,Poor Picture,"Despite the cheap price (on clearance from Target at $143), it isn't worth the money. Out of the box the picture is very grainy and the top 4 inches of the screen appears as a light grey instead of black. The number of connections on the back/front are impressive for a set in this price range (3 inputs + S-video). I've owned other Daewoo products in the past (and still do) and they've been stellar, but this one is really disappointing."
2,Definitive? Hardly.,"This book was outdated before it was even published. It's a buyer's guide that should have been released as some sort of one-time periodical. At the time of this review (July 2006), there's absolutely nothing of use here. Every single review is outdated - some by two generations. There is a fairly breezy guide to some sound synthesis basics, but nothing you couldn't get in any number of related books. Stay away!"
2,Sticky Buttons,"Although this controller was advertised as having a ""tight joystick"", I should have been more skeptical about the button quality. Something was spilled on this controller, making the buttons sticky. I opened the controller to clean it out and found that there was a brown dried liquid (probably coke) on the inside. I was not happy with the quality here. Bad purchase."
3,Worked OK,The remote arrived in a timely manner and worked well except that the analog stick was a little loose and had response issues. Otherwise it was a good deal.
4,Original Controllers are Best,"If you get one in good condition (no spills or rough handling) they will last a long time. Though they are better than third party controllers in almost every way, they are smaller and cramped for large hands."
4,A great controller.,"This controller is a good controller. I mean, it was the first controller to popularize analog sticks, in this case called the ""control stick"" on the N64. The controller is really comfortable. The way that Nintendo made this actually allows you to play in two ways! You can play it like an NES or SNES controller with six buttons on the right, or you can put your left thumb on the control stick and your right thumb on the six button layout. Now, lets talk about the control stick. It's okay, but it's fragile. It eventually gets loose and wobbles around on one side when you let go of it. The buttons are perfect unless you spill and sugar-substance on the buttons. Like for example, soda or orange juice. So this controller is a great controller, especially if you need some multiplayer in Super Smash Bros."
5,Looks and feels brand new,"This controller looks and feels like just took it out of the package. Amazing buy for the price. Nice tight joystick, and it doesn't ghost!"
3,Stick doesn't work,One of the controllers I bought works fine but the other controller won't let you go up. Overall they are decent quality
5,Good Buy,"It came within 3 days of my purchase and it works very well. Everything is in tact and I love it. The joystick isn't loose, but it isn't tight either; it's like gently used. Definitely a great buy though!"
1,Do not buy this product,"This product has been discontinued by Microsoft. All support for this product has been discontinued. Parts of the program will not work unless it is registered. You can no longer register this software with Microsoft. Unless you want to throw money away, do not purchase this product."
2,Should have listened to Joe,"I am very disappointed with this product, even with the $40.00 rebate it isn't worth the money. I currently have Version 7 and it is better than this one. If I could I would return it. The only good new feature is the smart erase but that alone isn't worth the $36.99 I am paying. Since I bought it it has dropped $10.00. There are other programs a lot better."
2,microsoft digital image pro 10,"Do NOT BUY THIS Mirosoft has discontinued all digital image progams and there is only support until april 2010. Not a very good deal. and the older version picture it, was much better. This one doesn't have the poster maker on it, and i used that a lot in my buiness. For the price, it was a waste."
1,Digatal Image Pro,"This is a good product, as I had an earlier version. However I have a new computer, with windows 7.This version doesn't with windows 7. They don't tell you up frout which operating systems it works with.I was able to return it, with a refund minus postage. (Which in itself is a Bummer) That should have been considered the cost of doing business."
2,Huh?,"Phillip Glass does jazz! Found this CD through Lincoln's TV ads. While several cuts are excellent, especially ""Get a Move On"", the repetition gets tedious. Kind of like Karaoke backround, I kept expecting the singer to begin, or a melody to break out!"
1,Keep it away from me,"'Unreal' is the right title for this awful CD! I bought it for the Lincoln car commercial music, which is just a short portion of this recording. The rest is pure junk! I can't even give it away, because I'm embarassed. I will throw it in the thrash. You can't call this music, just a repetitious noise."
4,Hangin' Out with Mr. Scruff,"Like many others, I first came to this CD after hunting down the theme music (Get A Move On) for a series of Lincoln Navigator automobile commercials which played incessantly during OLN Cable Network's 2002 Tour de France coverage. I love this CD. It's an insane jumble of different styles of music (jazzy semi-instrumentals, strange hybrid techno/house/disco stuff, thoughtful ballads, etc.). My husband and the baby like it. Even my ultra-conservative brother wants a copy of this CD!"
3,Does this guy have a fish thing or what?,"As was said by another reviewer, it's really hit and miss. There are a few really great songs, but as an album it doesn't feel complete. The in-between songs are just repetitive fluff, old vinyl gone horribly wrong. A few years ago i would have loved this disc, but I think I've moved on. I no longer dig the 'sampled' feeling with recordings like this and go more for the electronic edge. If you like wagon christ or any of the many djs on this label you will like this one. If you don't like listening to silly vinyl loops, wait for some of his stuff to appear on various artists compilations."
3,Giving credit....,"I had not heard of Mr. Scruff till I linked onto his page; I am intrigued and will certainly investigate. The three star rating is in place of a non-rating. I must, however, give credit to a ground breaking musician whos music is the heart and soul of ""Get a Move On"": Moondog. Check out the amazing Sax Pax for a Sax album to hear who really wrote this ""hit."" Too bad he never had one before his death. If only one new person discovers Moondog- this note will be worth it."
4,"odd ball funk, (ready made for cocktail party)+ oh yeah!","mr. scruff, oh mr. scruff...you've made a very nice cd indeed. It has all different kinds of beats, vocals and samples. You not only manage to keep the listener interested, but also keep the songs fresh and innovative. Each track is almost alarmingly different from the others. Truly a fantastic mix mr. scruff. Kudos to the fish."
3,Moondog redux,"If you like Get a Move On which is used in Lincoln Navigator commercial, hear the original from Moondog, called Bird's Lament."
5,One of the best albums in my collection 1999-2000,"I am a heavy duty buyer, with wide abstract taste - ninja tunes - K&D, Orbital etc - so it was great to hear a new fresh sound - and several ocean going themes to boot. More fish and mammals please."
2,"Great Graphics, slow play","THis game has great graphics, as compared to other bowling games. But the game play goes at a snail's pace. It's best to look elsewhere for a bowling game."
3,"It was not bad, but I would not watch again","I laughed a few times, but it was alright. I prefer Rusell Peters. this had more imitations, not my thing."
5,Danny Bhoy: Subject to Change,"This is the 8th DVD of Danny Bhoy we have bought, we love him so much we give them to others as gifts."
1,kit review,quality of wood in kit is very poor. much of it broke/crumbled while simply unpacking it. no plans to build this kit as a result and very disapointed with it.
5,Great Price Good Quality,"This item was used, but I didn't see any signs of that. There were no scratches on the DVD and it played just fine. The quality was better than VHS, but it did not look like it was remastered or anything like that. These episodes looked the same as when they aired on TV before they added those extra special effects several years ago. Good quality especially for the price."
3,Pretty good TREK,"These are two OK episodes. To me they are notable for the following:Ultimate Computer -- Kirk's ""all I ask is a tall ship"" speech gives me goosebumps every time.Omega Glory -- Kirk and Tracey beat the tar out of each other in several fights throughout the course of this episode. As far as I can tell, William Shatner and Morgan Woodward do all their own stunts, which is pretty impressive as they're throwing each other around A LOT.Add to that the fact that Kirk gets roughed up by the Yang leader in that sequence in the prison cell and you have a pretty tough week of work for ol' Mr. Shatner!"
3,Another parallel-development world & another killer computer,"Not the very best episodes among the original series offerings; they're weighed down a bit by, respectively, too much heavy allegory (""The Omega Glory"") and excess preachiness (""The Ultimate Computer""). Both episodes, however, showcase some good character moments and humor. And, like all the original series Treks on DVD, the picture is sharp and clean. One could do worse."
4,Good/Bad,"This latest TOS DVD features one of the better TOS episodes, ""The Ultimate Computer"", and one of the worst, ""The Omega Glory"". ""Ultimate Computer"" is probably the last great TOS episode, focusing on the age-old conflict between man and machine--can a computer run the Enterprise as well as man? On the other hand, ""Omega Glory"" is an annoying, thinly-disguised (and dated) commentary on the Viet Nam War. The new DVD release features superb video quality, although the audio had a few flaws (""hiccups"" in the dialog, picture and sound out of synch at times)."
5,This book was very surprising and entertaining.,"Gemini 7 is about Jonah and Jen who have been girlfriend and boyfriend since they were 7. The boy loves going online and meets another girl (Gemini 7)who sends him a picture of herself. He finds her quite attractive. They eventually meet and spend time together. When Jen finds out, trouble starts! It turns out the Nicole (Gemini 7) has a twin sister who started a fire. They start playing mean tricks on Jen, including putting drugs in her purse, causing her to break her wrist, and other things that you would not want to happen to you. When Jonah finds out, he and Jen go out to the woods in a cabin. Nicole starts a fire in the woods and chases Jonah and Jen to a river with a knife. Nicole eventually drops the knife, falls on it. Read on to see what happens next! I loved this book because things kept happening and you could never tell what might happen next. I could hardly put it down, and when I finished it, I wanted to read more books in the series."
2,book,"The Book, Danger.Com, Gemini7, by Jordan Cray, was a different story. Meeting people on line is a common thing, but in this story, it has become very frightening. Mysteries things start happening to Jonah. He doesn't go to summer school, and the prettiest girl meets him. Nicole starts destroying people to make Jonah all hers. His new love foils with his old and makes him the new slime-ball. Either way, Jonah has lost it."
4,Great Documentary,"I found this book intersting and hearbreaking. As a student at Lincoln from 90-93 I knew who these guys were, but not their stories. I was friends with Darryl Flicking's (Russell Thomas')long time girlfriend. I did not know that he died. Does anyone know what really happened to Darryl?"
4,"The Last Shot: City Streets, Basketball Dreams","good look at the inside game being played behind the scenes and the pressure faced by young men in the ghetto to succeed at what they view as their best shot at fame,fortune, and notoriety. But for some its a dream to just hopefully escape their impoverished lives and get out of coney island. Success finally being realized in the form of a college education and eventually getting a good job or maybe even starting a career in something they dreamed about. Unfortunately this book shows just how few and far between are the ones who ever really make it - regardless of how talented or great they are at basketball. Overall a well written book that keeps the reader interested and in the end rooting for the main characters to ""make it"" . I found myself praying and hoping for a happy ending for the main focus of the story."
5,A GREAT BOOK,A great book for basketball fans who are interested in the workings of the recruiting process of inner city kids.
5,The best book ever!!,"If you know the game of basketball, or even if you don't, you will find that this is one of the best books ever written. I've read it several times and I still want to read it again"
5,For Any One Who Truly Cares,This book was the best written and best depicted book I have ever read. From the beginning it was raw and real. For any one who truly cares about and loves basketball this is a must read. This is as raw and real as it gets in the basketball world.
5,Symphony of words,"This book should be a classic, if it isn't already. As someone who hasn't a great deal of interest in basketball, I can throughly recommend it simply for the author's style. The man's prose reads like a dream as he brings the characters to life in an inimitable way. He enables you, the reader, to go right into the streets of New York and live the lives of each of his main characters, to get to know them, understand them and - in a sense - to *be* them. A definite must for your library."
5,Coney Island Playgrounds,"This book really expresses what it's like to live in the Coney Island projects, with nothing but a dream to live by. In between poverty and stardom, education is a long-term key that these boys don't focus on enough, because they know that basketball is what is gonna get them out of the streets, and into college (or maybe even the big time NBA, for a selected few) But the association between grades isn't emphasized at all. These guys show a great passion and desire for the game. Proud to string up shining white nets on the playgrounds, proud to have gotten snap-back rims for dunking. The game is all about desire, pride, passion, and also slightly important: skill. This book by Darcy Frey shows all of these by by just describing Russell, Tchaka, Stephon, and all the others."
4,Consistency From A Rap Legend in The Making,"This ""mixtape"" is hot. It's not as good as the first Gilla House Mixtape, but it still is vintage Redman, as usual, Redman delivers as well as Icarus and Saukrates, and newcomer Melanie, in my opinion, the first it better, but any fan should have both, Look out for Volume 3, hopefully dropping soon!!!!!!!!"
1,false image,"I thought, due to the picture, I was going to get a whole set of long johns, but all I got was the pants. This was a huge disappointment to me, as I needed the whole set for a ski trip and had to make due with wearing an extra shirt instead. If there's one thing I hate, it's false advertising!"
3,be careful of description,"model shows top and bottom, order form does not ask top or bottom so be aware you are getting bottoms only for 22.40 you might as well order the bottoms only for 21.00!"
2,Beware - This is for the bottoms ONLY,"The description is deceptive and incomplete, you are purchasing the bottoms ONLY. What is the point of long johns if you have toasty legs but your arms fall off due to frost bite. The picture makes it look like you are buying the whole outfit. I will be wary of this vendor."
2,3 Candy Cane Driveway Markers,"The first time I used the product it worked fine, however the next night nothing changed the fuses, still nothing. No instructions provided on how to open the candy cane and check on the bulbs without breaking it! If you have this product and have opened it to change the bulbs (which by the way are provided) please respond to this review."
5,The most thought-provoking JFK Assassination book!!,"I have read virtually every JFK assassination book thathas been published. This is the only one that focuses on whoreally was behind it and why. What does it matter who wasshooting from where? What matters is who was behind it andwhy. This is the first book that attempts to answer thesequestions and why the usual theories (Mafia, Castro,CIA etc)are not viable when evaluated objectively. ""The TexasConnection"" is a must for anyone interested in the murderof John F. Kennedy."
2,A Long Shot,"I read this book many years ago and recently re-read it. I am now amazed at the extent that the author went to mis-quote witnesses in order to prove his thesis. A prime example of mis-quotes can be found when one compares Zirbel's quotes from the Warren Commission with those actually in the Warren Commission's report. Many are taken out of context, or misrepresented in a way that is favorable to Zirbel's theory. I was amused by the mendacity of Zirbel's speculation that Ralph Yarborough was to be the intended limo companion of the first couple. Such an assertation is based purely on speculation, with no factual evidence to back it up. Overall I found the Texas Connection's theories to be an even longer and more arduous shot than the one Oswald may have taken on Nov. 22, 1963."
4,Enthralling and provocative,"I found this book one which I couldn't put down - I found it enthralling, extremely convincing. You have to rmember that it is probable that some could find holes in the scenarion which is suggested, but the book is extremely convincing and thoroughly readable."
1,Weak analysis and too many errors,"I have read the book upon the recommendations I saw posted here. Early on, I was put off by stupid errors (spelling and others) such as referring to the Organized Crime-fighting of Ralph Guilani (sic) of New York.The analyses of various possible conspirators seemed like those that a tenth grade civics class might come up with ""now in the last ten minutes before our class is over""."
3,Smells sexy,"I love this perfume. Its that perfume you want to throw on during the summertime. The smell lasts a good amount of time I can say but wears off after a few hours, 3 to four to be exact but I recomend it because it turns heads."
5,Love it,I absolutely love this perfume. I get compliments all the time. A must have for me! It is a great fragrance and I highly recommend it.
3,Not a big fan of the scent.,"The main reason why I still have this parfum is because the bottle is so pretty sitting up on my armoir. I'm not really a big fan of the parfum's scent. It's very bland, boring, and has no kick to it. It reminds me of the musk that my mother used to wear back in the 1980s. If you are a J-Lo fan, however, I would go with her Miami Glow."
2,strong and fruity,I had this one when I was 18 and I wouldnt wear it today.Im not a fan of fruity purfumes but I think this is suitable if your 16 years old.The bottle is prettier and the fragrance has a strong exotic fruity smell.
5,the great smell,"The product arrived in time in Brazil, in according with the estimated. I love the smell and i'm very happy."
4,Finally Found a Reasonable Price,"I have been searching for a reasonable purchase price for this perfume. I like the fragrance, but did not want to spend too much for something that I wear in the summer. I am satisfied with the price and quality of this purchase."
5,It was very good,This is the best service I have gotten from online shopping.Im definitily shopping on Amazon.com more often.
5,great perfume,I will recomend this perfume for a young lady. It is very popular now. I got a great price with fast delievey
5,wonderful,was told sevrel times that they like the smell of the parfum. i myself enjoy it very much. it my not be for everyone. the smell of it is not to strong. has that right kind of smell for a women
4,Almost Perfect,"Seasoning is perfect but I had worries because the description did not list the size, it could have been the small bottle that they sell in the local stores, but it is the commercial size, would it hurt to state the size? Would be 5 stars if it did!"
5,Maggi,"There is simply NO way to make a proper vinaigrette without it. Cut your tomatoes in small pieces, add vinegar and 1 tbsp Maggi, chives, mustard, and let sit for approx 15 mins. THEN add oil. Et voilà!"
4,Traditon,"With a Swiss/German background, I have always had a bottle in the house. Even better, is the big bottle, that allows me to refill the smaller bottles of the less Maggi'ed."
2,I hated Maggi seasoning.,"I heard good things about the seasoning on the radion but when I tried it, I wanted to throw it out, the flavor was unpleasant. I like a lot of different foods from different countries so I did not expect to dislike it."
5,Excellent resource for pastors & those who work with the dying,"Excellent and insightful book composed of three parts: insights into the dying process, stories of how people found peace in their dying using the Enniagram as a paradigm, and resources about the dying process. I have even used the stories from the middle section to help a person who was unable to commuicate to process their own decline and inevitable death. Teaches how to help a person prepare for their death in a wholesome and healing manner. Offers great insight into the nature of spiritual pain."
3,Only for superfans,"Oscar is great, but these transcriptions will make very little sense if you are not intimately familiar with the specific recordings from which they are derived."
4,an enjoyable CD,"I liked this CD (especially ""Get Here""), but I have to admit, I like their new stuff better. Still, it's a very good CD and I'm glad I added it to my collection. Anything by Tonic Sol-fa is good!"
3,Watch out!,Supports limited hardware! I bought this to save me from having to install and configure a new video card in a desktop. After struggling for a half-hour - I found a compatiblity tool buried in the Maxtor website. My plain-jane Dell is not supported! Don't buy without confirming it will work with your PC!
2,Difficult to set up and tech support is non-existent,"I bought this device with the expectation of a plug and play experience. The outcome was as frustrating as one could imagine. The compatability tool asked me to auto adjust. I did. Error message pops up, does not support video mode. Off to tech support. No help as they didn't bother to give me a customer number which is required to use tech support. Long story short, I am a tech savvy person and the Matrox approach to this product clearly requires an engineer that is willing to poke and prod to arrive at a solution at some point. This is not ready for prime time."
3,Difficult to configure,"It was a nightmare getting the DuealHead2Go working with my laptop/screens. I followed the instructions that were included and both my lcd screens displayed with 3 inch black bars to the left. I had to go to the matrox forums to troubleshoot. I found out that this is a problem that some people have with the duelhead2go firmware. If you talk to support staff on the forum they will send you a firmware patch which is not available on their site. The patch then would not install. In the end I had to install the firmware patch with another computer then switch back to my laptop. The matrox auto adjustment did not align my screens correctly, but I was able to do that through my samsung monitors. Now that I have this correctly installed I like it a lot, but I would suggest paying to extra $$ for a triplehead2go to others. The triplehead2go is a far tter product, and from all indications rarely has any problem correctly configuring your monitors."
2,Not worth the money,"I bought this item to attach dual monitors to my laptop. Since I already had one flat panel monitor, I bought another one for $300 and the dualhead to go for $155. I checked the compatability Maxtor tool to see if it will work with my Dell Latitude X1. It passed the compatibility test. The installation worked like a breeze but the monitor output of 2048x780 was less than stellar. It hurts your eyes. Also, dialog boxes open across the two screens and that can be a pain too. Unless you have a graphic chipset with a higher resolution, I would save my money. Better tool is to buy a regular desk top computer with dual monitor card (costs less than $20) and you will be much happier. Or get a synchronizing tool for keeping your laptop and desktop up to date. Or, bite the bullet and buy a large monitor."
1,UNstaifactory Customer Service,"I purchased this product and unfortunately it did not meet my resolution requirements. I called their customer service department and experienced a rather difficult lenghthy procedure for returning the product. After following their instructions to the letter, i never received a refund of any amount for the purchase. The prodcutworked but the comapany did not."
2,Space opera? I don't think so...,"I don't get all the glowing reviews for this book. It seems like the author started with David Weber's excellent Honorverse books, then a) replaced all the epic space battles with frankly boringly written ""horse stuff"" b) replaced any semblance of a good story with painfully detailed minutia about some type of rehab. This is *not* space opera. This is not even a good book. Skip it."
2,Space soap opera,"The first book included is more of a soap opera than a space opera, with endless talk about decorating, horses, and relationships. Gah! The second one is decent, and I gave up before finishing the third."
1,Very Surprising,"After reading the author's Paksannarion series I had fairly high hopes that this would at least be a book with a fair amount of pace and a decent storyline, even if the characters - like the Paks series - were to be somewhat lacking. No such luck. The characters barely approach the one dimensional, while the story - if you can call it that - moves along with all the speed of the erosion of granite being weathered by drizzle.If you find watching an oak tree growing too exciting, then this is probably the book to help calm your nerves. Astonishingly tedious and utterly dire."
3,WARNING! Consist of reprints! Otherwise GREAT!,"First and formost - do not make the mistake that I made. This is NOT a new novel, this book consist of reprints of the original novels: Hunting Party, Winning Colors and Sporting Chance. So be forwarned.Second - the novels contained are very entertaining, engaging and fun to read. If you like female heros and/or military Sci Fi then you need to check these out.Normally I would give these stories either 4 or 5 stars, but because these are reprints of her novels from 1994/95 and that information is not in the description, the best I can do is 3 stars."
2,Same as others,"There are hundreds if not thousands of books these day on non duality it seems. This is another. It repeats the basic belief system of this theory in similar words to the rest. Not better not worse.There are thousands of teachers claiming to have been suddenly enlightened and now are able to repeat what they learnt. So there should be nothing new. And there is not in this. I read it as I would a novel. Read, finish thats it. Actually it was a couple of months ago and I cannot remember anything from it at all. So perhaps I would have been better reading a novel.I only remember that it was ok."
1,OLD!!!,"yea, you're better off buying it from barnes & noble or wherever because this edition is FIVE YEARS OLD!!!! BEware!"
5,Mommie Dearest,I love this movie. I remember watching it as a child and I have been wanting to purchase it. The next movie I am trying to find is THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING WOMAN another great movie.
4,NOT ONE OF HER FANS!!,"If you are looking for a theatrical piece of serious drama do not get this movie. However, if you are looking for one of the campiest, over the top dramatic performances ever, BUY THIS MOVIE! Faye Dunaway stars as Joan Crawford the screen legend who was glamorous and beautiful to her adoring fans, yet had a nasty hateful side at home. While the storyline is compelling , you cannot help but laugh at the portrayal of the roles. (With the exception of Diana Scarwid who puts in some good acting from time to time). Perhaps best known for it's one liners ""No wire hangers"" and ""Im not mad at you Helga I am mad at the dirt"", the movie is entertaining, and good for a laugh."
4,The title is the tip of the madness,"What a fun romp of a film. Faye Dunaway is almost identical to Joan Crawford in looks and voice as well. The setting of this film is wonderful to look at but it hides a darkness that never ends for poor Christina Crawford and the audience, just like her never knows when the bomb is going to go off. See this movie for the mere fact that it is a classic and a look behind the curtain of one of hollywood's biggest stars."
1,Damaged DVD.,I got this movie for my mom.LOL. For xmas. I opened the dvd put it in the dvd player and it was skipping. BRAND NEW! I looked at the dvd and the ring in the middle looked a bit damamged. I wont buy another!
1,Terrible,"How can any of the many reviewers say this is a great movie. It is awful! The supporting actors are awful (especially the older Christina). The soul reason I give this one star is for Faye Dunaway. Yes she was good, not at her best, but was good. Dunaway was much better ini ""Bonnie and Clyde"" and ""Chinatown"". She can not get this movie out of the whole. Yes, you do find yourself laughing, but that was nnot the intention. The intention was to make you sad and mad, but it did not succeed. it only made us laugh harder. It is such a terrible movie because it is so atupid. The way they depict Joan ,Crawford's personal life is really quite terrible. Hollywood agrees with me. The Golden Raspberry Awards (Worst movie awards) gave ""Mommie Dearest"" the title of worst film of the '80's. Maybe it wasn't the worst film of the 80's but it was one of them. ""Mommie Dearest"" deserved every poor review it got."
1,Very Disrespectful to Joan Crawford's Memory!,"Thankfully, we didn't pay for this movie. I rented it from Netflix after my Aunt recommended it to me. We were all very disappointed when we watched it at the beach. I have always loved Joan Crawford and thought she was a great actress. As you may know, this movie is based on the biography that her daughter Christina wrote on her. And with all the stories mentioned in the movie, it sounds like she hated her. It is a commandment in the Bible to honor your parents, and this violates that commandment bigtime. I also do not like the way that she talked in the movie. I believe wholeheartedly in the freedom of speech, otherwise I would petition the government to ban the book and the movie altogether."
1,I GOT TAKEN,The DVD I ordered arrived blank. There was no movie on it at all. I got taken! I will never order again....don't trust. It's to bad.
5,"Hello, I'm Joan Crawford and I have various assorted Issues","If you don't love this movie you're dead. It made me uneasy when I first saw it as a young teenager. Now it's so horrible that it soars on every level. It's a train wreck, and you'll love it."
4,Psycho Mommy!,"Joan Crawford's adopted daughter brought us this true story about her experiences with her obsessive-compulsive and violent mother. When Joan learns that her fame and money is quickly falling, she takes out her frusterations on her poor daughter. I must admit that some of the scenes were downright hilarious. Like the scene where she wakes her daughter up at 2 am yelling that the bathroom isn't clean and goes psycho with the Comet cleanser. Seriously, if she was my mom I would have been laughing my ass off at her constantly! And if she would have beat ME with a wire clothes hanger for no reason, on boy! I would have kicked her f****** teeth in! And if she would have cut MY hair off, I would have ripped hers out! If she was going to turn into this psycho mommy from hell then I would turn into a ""bad seed"" girl and scare her away! It's a good thing she gets revenge at the end!"
4,Mommie Dearest,"This is a really good movie but I had talked about it so much to my kids that they said it wasn't as good as I made it out to be. Oh well, this generation just doesn't realize how lucky they are!"
4,More real than you realise,"When this film happened to come on TV when I was a child I was mesmerised by it. The reason I couldn't take my eyes off the screen was that it was the first time I had ever seen anyone acting on TV or anywhere else like my own mother did. Some of us actually live with people who behave like that.If you had the same experience read Christina's book and also read this book""Understanding the Borderline Mother"" by another Christina and avilable on Amazon.It explains Joan Crawford and the other mother's like her completely."
3,Bought as a gift,This is English and French. I thought it was an updated DVD. I had an older version and bought this as a gift. I opened it and its in English and French on the cover.
5,NOOOOO wirrrrree hangaaaaasssssss!!!!,"Its so bad, its good, and goes right back to bad again-with a hint of guilty goodness!!!!!!! Love it! SEE IT"
4,Fun and disturbing both,"Faye Dunaway has a blast playing the brilliant and demented Joan Crawford. As a result, the audience loves her, even though she is a child-abusing, obsessive, self-centered, self-destructive woman. To be watched with the same guilty pleasure as ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?"" and ""Hush, hush, Sweet Charlotte"" and any other of those classic Hollywood, over the top, camp favorites. Is it all true? Who knows...but if you can forget that question and just go for the ride, you'll have a lot of laughs and a lot of pity for the Crawfords one and all."
4,Get me the axe!!,"What fun this is.Originally, Christina wanted a serious film about child-abuse to star Anne Bancroft. As the script got campier, Bancroft left.In with Faye Dunaway.If you're not the daughter, who can really complain?One of the best camp entries ever, with Faye chewing every line before spitting it out."
3,Shocking and Chilling.,"There has not ever been an biographical movie ever done this way. It shows the darkside of the actress Joan Crawford. The acting is okay, Faye Dunaway acts really well. The movie is a little drawn out, but it is still very interesting to watch."
3,Brutal Movie!!!,"This movie was down right brutal. How could anyone treat their kids that way? I mean, she got mad if her daughter used wire hangers. She only alowed her kid to have 1 toy for their birthday and Christmas. If she was my mom I would have to kill myself to be in peace!!!"
2,Mommie Cheapest,"After seeing this film the only person I felt sorry for was Faye Dunaway. Actors get paid a great deal, but this film proves that they have to take responsibily for the mistakes of everyone else involved. She may have put too much into the movie, but everyone else seemed to put far too little into it, especially the supporting actors and the studio. It's no surprise she wanted wooden coat hangers, they would fit in with the rest of the cast. She seemed to spend the latter 3 decades of her life as Joan Crawford in the same 2/3 places, no wonder she went boss-eyed. Surely she cannot have been aware how bad this film would have turned out. I think the biggest issue this film raises is cruelty to actors."
5,Mommy Dearest,Arrived on time and in the exact condition as stated in their description. I would use them again.
5,"Sensational, Over The Top, Electric Trash!","Although this picture bombed at the box office and probably did not help Faye Dunaway's career, Mommie Dearest is an exciting, perverted and probably contrived view of the life of an actress during Hollywood's golden era. The script is downright awful, Diana Scarwid is a truly pitiful actress, but Faye's Joan is electric. The makeup, the wardrobe, the sets, the melodrama that turns shockingly violent at times, and the classic lines are all worth seeing over and over again. Really good trash! I loved it."
3,How much is true and how much is not?,"This movie was good but not as good as the book, Faye Dunnaway is a good actress but did kind of over act here, the little girl who played the younger Christina was adorable and did a good acting job. Now if all of that abuse really did happen than it's just so sad and awful but even though I liked the book and the movie as with all all tell all types of books and movies I wonder how much of the story was true and how much made up. As I recall from the book two of Joan's four adoptive children claimed she was physically and verbally abusive but I heard on one of those reality news type of TV shows that the other two said there was no abuse and that she was a very loving mother so who is telling the truth and who isn't is hard to tell"
3,for spoiled kids to watch. while on punishment,"this movie is an old one but it is in color...there are some real life ...beatings in this movie, then again...i glad my parents did not go that far. emotional movie and you will be glad you don't live in that house."
3,no more wire hangers,"I have a lot of mixed feelings of this movie. First off, I have to give props to Faye Dunaway for playing Joan Crawford the way she did. She was impecable. The face did not really look like her, but everything else did.OVerall, I thought the movie was a little overdown. Some of the scenes that were in the movie, I felt should not have been there. FOr example: The scene where one of her lover was going to leave, it took them about 10 minutes to do that scene.The scene in the barn, where Christina gets caught making out with the boy. THat is not how it was written in the book. She supposedly was raped. I don't understand why they would rewrite a scene like that.I always belive to make a really good bio pic it needs to be extremely long. That way they can cover everything. I also felt that this movie did not focus on the relationship enough between mother and daughter and more on Joan Crawford. Finally I did not really like this movie."
3,A Sad Story About a Broken Starlet...,"This movie was a little bit of a disappointment. But, it still revealed the ""broken"" Joan Crawford. She needed a ""Saviour"" to heal her and deliver her from her demons."
5,Classic,Camp classic generations will adore. One of the best movies about Hollywood that will be admired for years. I loved it.
4,I Loved It,I loved the movie. Can someone please tell me what soap opera Christina Crawford stared in?
5,Delightfully Depraved,"This movie is one of my favorites of all time. My cousin introduced me to it when i was young, and we still quote it and wet ourselves laughing.Fay does a job that borders on TOO fabulous (reason enough to buy it), but Joan is the real draw.If nothing else, buy it for the answering machine material possibilities."
4,mommie dearest,"my sister loves this movie so I was glad to find it for her. no retail stores sell it, when she got it she was exstatic. i of coarse bought one for myself as well, but I have yet to watch it."
1,Not a Good Movie,"This movie was horrible and to top it off the seller harrassed me about my review. If you want to see horrible things that will make your stomach turn, get this movie, if not stay away"
2,A big disappointment full of painfully BAD acting!,"This is an example of a book with great movie potential going horribly awry! Christina Crawford's autobiograhical bestseller about her Hollywood upbringing at the hands of her alcoholic, moviestar 'Mommie' Joan Crawford, was powerful, enfuriating, and heartbreaking. The movie, unfortunately, is just a mish-mash of overblown acting and there is little continuity between the scenes. I nearly walked out on this movie when I first saw it, and it's not much better on the small screen! The period sets, costumes, and Faye Dunaway's makeup are right, but the tone of the film is way off! Both the Christinas were horribly cast, and I had no sympathy for either one. Diana Scarwid's acting is downright embarrassing (since when did Christina have a Southern accent?)! It's really sad that the original message about child-abuse is lost in this ridiculous, campy trash."
1,dont work,"I have been looking all over for this movie, when i got it and tried watching it the movie will only play for about 10 mins and then it skips and messes up. Very dissapointed. I've been to every movie store in my area and they told me i can only get it online. I feel it was a waste of money."
5,Joan is Dead!,"This film (as well as the novel) is very one-sided. Joan is dead so she cannot defend herself. Christina's supposed abuse is nothing compared to the abuse Joan suffered throughout her life. Just do a search on Joan Crawford and you can read her bio on various web sites. Also (and I think this needs to be said) If you are going to write a book on someone, at least have the balls to write it while your subject is STILL ALIVE!"
4,Quality of DVD,"Haven't used Amazon for too many purchases, but have recently ordered two items and I was truly surprised how quickly they came and how I had honestly received the items in the condition that was specified. Very happy with the service provided!"
3,It's not just about Joan Crawford.,"It's about adoption, too. Christina is not the only child to be abused by her adopters. There are other issues to consider while watching this movie. Motives for wanting to be known as the parent of someone else's child should always be questioned -- like Crawford's motive for publicity. Also, money does not guarantee a healthy, happy environment. For all her wealth, Crawford provided an extremely dysfunctional home for her adoptees. And, the abuse an adoptee suffers is compounded by the emotional damaged that comes with adoption itself, so please watch this movie with Christina in mind."
3,A Good movie for a Classic,For a Classic movie this one is a good one. It makes you feel the anger the daughter feels as she is abused and unloved. Based on a true story it makes the movie more interesting that Joan Crawford got away with as much as she did because of her money.
3,Mommie Dearest,"I remember seeing this movie when I was a young boy and was shocked! Now as an adult I see the world differentely, but this is a movie that I would recommend to see at least twice! The grass isn't always greener on the other side! People have problems no matter what your economic/social status is. This movie does a great job showing some realities of life.--Note, I didn't like the comments from and or about some drag queen. After I watched that part I was wondering the revelance to the movie?"
3,Why must EVERYthing be a CON-test??,"This is undeniably one of the best, camp classics out and it's a guilty pleasure to watch. I have seen music videos in various clubs that have the scenes taken out of the movie and put into the video...which make it all the more funny. The acting is just...overdramatic. It's a true classic and if you're a ""family"" guy, you must have this one in your video collection.My only complaint about the DVD is that it offers no special features (besides the trailer). Interviews with the cast, or Christina Crawford, or even ""The Making Of 'Mommmie Dearest'"" would have made the DVD a solid, 5-star winner.And remember, when you polish the floor you have to MOVE the TREE."
4,Hey...I Get It Now!,"Thank God for the comments from TULSA and others here which admit to the camp humor of this film! When I first saw it, I thought there was perhaps something wrong with me for thinking it was funny. But now I look back and realize that this really WAS intended to be a bitingly satirical, ""let the laughter echo inside your head"", type of movie. I often liken it to a spoof of the old ""Dracula"" m movies, with Crawford as the vampire draining the life forces out of her daughter,and the Hollywood mansion the ""old dark castle."" Had there been a scene involving garlic it would have been perfect!"
2,FUNNY: Though Not Meant To Be,"I am going to make this very short. This is the funniest piece of crap that Hollywood ever produced; that was meant to be serious. It comes off as a comedy; as it should. There are many quotable lines beside the wire hangers quote in this laughtrap; ""I'm not mad at you. I'm mad at the dirt."" ""Why must EVERYTHING be a contest?"", ""Why can't you treat me with the same respect that I deserve; that I'd get from any stranger on the street?"" and many, many, others. Right up there with ""Whatever Happened To Baby Jane"" and ""The Color Purple"" for quoteability."
4,More realistic than you might think...,"Just read some of the reviews about this movie and I had to add my two cents. Not many people have ever heard of Borderline Personality Disorder, but Joan Crawford had it, and that's why she acted the way she did. The movie seems over-the-top because that's what BPD is all about -- being overly emotional and over-the-top. To anyone who hasn't experienced it personally, I'm sure the movie does seem ludicrous and overdone; however, the sad thing is that it actually happened, and continues to happen to millions of unfortunate children.I oughta know, my mother is Borderline. How ironic that she used to hate this movie -- she pulled a Joan Crawford whenever I jokingly called her ""Mommie Dearest""! *sigh* Yeah, it's really not funny at all if you've lived it."
1,A CAMP CLASSIC WITH NO FEATURES??? BOOOOOH!!!,"Leave it to Paramount video to take a camp classic like ""Mommie Dearest"" and turn this event into a bummer! If you can believe it: they have given it absolutely NO ADDED FEATURES. That's right: no insights from Faye Dunaway, no background chit chat from little Tina, not a word from Diana Scarwid. That's right, nothing! The scan and picture quality are all top notch but it's like being served a great big lucious bowl of Haagen Dazs WITHOUT A SPOON!"
4,"Well, in my opinion...","I saw an interview with Christina Crawford and I just have to tell you, I think she is a spoiled brat. I don't know what happened in the Crawford home and if abuse resided there then I am so sorry for everyone involved... but what I do know is that it seems like Christina is only worried about money. In the interview she was telling of how horrible her mother was because each year she would get fewer presents at Christmas time. Give me a break! Her mean old mom would even make her give her birthday gifts to children who didn't have the nice things she had. It is amazing what money will do to people. I would rather be poor as can be raising my children with just enough to get by, than raising a couple of spoiled brats!"
1,cover art looks great,"I watched short piece of this nonsense on computer and it was ok so I spent 25 bucks. Mistake. This flick is not really a movie but Lina Romey walking naked, being photographed, having sex and other boring activities. She doesnt look that great and her acting abilities well below zero. It is clear Rolls-Roy was rented for 4 hours and everything else not worth mentioning. But cover art looks great!"
