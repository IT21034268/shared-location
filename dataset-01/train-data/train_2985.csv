4,Great Little Game,My 8 year old loves this game. It is very interactive and he loves to play it. It is not one of those that just sits on his shelf. Well worth the price paid
2,"Not for ""everyone""","This game could be fun for older kids, but it rated E for everyone and there is no way my 6 year old son can play this came. I requires constant reading. You can't even start the game without having a reading/typing interaction for 10 minutes with another character. This game could be fun, but for much older kids. No violence, no obsenity, but no way to play if you aren't an avid reader."
3,not bad but it could be better,animal crossing isnt so bad if you like easy games.the graphics arent bad but there is room for improvemeent.the bad side about crossing is it has 24 hour time and it is wierd.the good side is that you can earn money and become the richest thing in your world.
3,game for LJG,"This is a game my child enjoys very much. However, you MUST be able to read in order to play this game. He likes it, but I find it very hard to know what he must do to get to each level."
2,"Fun at first, but rather repetitive","Okay, I know that tons of people like this game, and I have to admit, I enjoyed it at first. But it gets rather boring after just bit of time. I played this game for around 2 weeks before I began saying, ""Uh...okay...um...what now?"" After you upgrade your house fully, there's not much to do. Sure, there are holidays and a guest (usually the same ones) comes about every three or four days. And on occasion, someone will move away and another will take his(or her) place. But the overall of this game is summed up in to one word: repetitive. You don't have much to do besides what you've already done.Pros: Fun to build up your house.Interacting with the townspeople.Cons: Extremely repetitive.Not much to do.Overall, this game is good for smaller ones, but I think that if you're 10+, you'll get pretty bored."
5,Best Game EVER!!!,"Besides AC:WW ((Which came out about a year ago)) this game is my FAVORITE GAME EVER!!! However, different people will have mixed feelings about this game. Some people find it extremely boring, while others find it fun and interesting. It just depends. Its not just a bad game because one person calls it boring. Lots of other people think its fun, like ME! ^_^"
5,Love this simple and addictive game,"It's really a wonder that Nintendo can make something so simple and seemingly normal so fun, even in an offline setting.I got this as a birthday gift and it's now my favorite gamecube title. The real-time gameplay is amazing... right now in my town it's turning to fall, everyone's excited about the 3 holidays in october, and I have lots to do to work toward a better town and house!It shouldn't be this fun, but it is. Trust me!"
5,Simply Amazing!,"I have had this game for over a year, and let me tell you, I am STILL playing it! There is so much to do! The only problem is that there are some events that happen at certin times and you may not be home or may not be able to play it and miss the event (since the is a Real-Time game). Other then that, this games is nearly perfect! Trust me, you won't be dissapointed with this game. Also, I have been playing video games for over 12 years now (I am currently 14) and I know when a game is good, and this game isn't only good, it's, well, simply amazing!"
5,ANIMAL CROSSING,"My daughter absolutely loves this game. It follows the SIMS concept where you can build a home decorate it, choose your clothes, shop for items, you can get all sorts of cheats online and it keeps her busy all day. She loves that you can choose the music for the game too!GREAT GAME"
5,Love!,"I love this game, although I really wish the bees wouldn't be there, or at least not in the winter or fall because bees usually aren't out those seasons. All in all I would absolutely recommend to friends and buy again!"
4,Hours of fun put into one excellent game!,"When I went to the store to look at games or maybe buy one, I found Animal Crossing. It looked okay so I thought I would give it a try. When I played it was so fun that my sister wanted in and we had to take turn for about 2 weeks (then she had to go to collage).Its gameplay is excellent though you they should make more ways of raking in Bells (Animal Crossing currency). I also thought that the animals living in your town left to much so you didnt get to know them that well.Also the debts are HUGE! It took me about a month (considering homework and all that) to pay the last loan.Overall this is a really fun game and you should buy it at any age because parents can even play it and have fun. The controls are easy."
4,dont press that button!,"A great game....if you consider yourself a ""hard-core gamer"" like I do, don't just pass this game up because it looks kiddie. It truely is a great game....and please dont press reset."
3,Cross into the younger audience zone,"This game is fun all in all and will give you about 2 months of gaming joy,but (and yes it has major flaws) it is too G rated also once you get your house built it has no gaming value and 0 replay value.I built my house all the way up ect. ect. and havent touched the game since it was a major bummer for me because i did tons of extra chores to get this game and wasnt anything that i expected.I would highly reccomend not buying this game.Besides sims makes this game look like the parcley next to the 2 lb steak i caution you dont buy this game unless you are totaly sure you want it.I think the more negative reviews like these are more helpful than positive ones it makes you think about both sides of the issue so i dont want any people saying this was not helpful."
2,Terrible game,"This game has a few solid reasons to buy it, sadly it is outweighed completely by reasons not to buy it. lets start by listing the pros and cons:pros:*It's very addictive and is fun, sadly this joy only lasts for about 10 minutes*Very interactiveCons:*Talking with AI non-stop makes you feel like a total idiot*Its childish feel will make you want to hide it from your friends*The gameplay is extremely repetitive*Some of the objectives and tasks are just plain stupidWhat ran through my mind as I played the game for the first hour or so I thought what is the point? You do tasks to earn money. You use money to buy new items. You use new items to do MORE task. Not once through the entire game did I realize what the designer was going for. There is no winning, no losing, maybe the designers are trying to prevent hurt feelings."
1,I wanted something more,"Some people may like this game--that's fair enough. For myself, however, I don't need a game that takes me through life's everyday mundane chores. If I want to go fishing, I'll go fishing. Why play a game that replicates normal life? If I wanted to experience ""normal"" life, I'd simply experience it--not play it in a game (and indeed, I live out a rather enjoyable normal life--physically doing the things I want to do). I suppose I come from the mindset that videogames are supposed to offer something more or different--something that you cannot have in ordinary life. This game only gives you what you can already have."
1,STINKS,Wow this game is terbile I rented it at blockbuster and completed at least 30 missions in 70 minuits I got so angry and tore up the game punched every thing tore the game up threw the tv on the floor and every thing broke.Sadly the game is to easy to beat for ages 5 and under.
5,Why is Animal Crossing a good game?,"People kewp asking ""Whats isn so special about this game? They think its stupid. Ask most of them ""Have u played it for more than two hours? and most will reply no.Animal Crossing has bad graphics and sound. All N64 Japanese ports have that charicteristic.What makes Animal Crossing special?1. It has an enormous amount of stuff u can do2. It comes with a slew of classic NES games3. It is real time4. ITS NOT THE SIMS!! ITS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE REAL!! (Hech, all ur neighbors are ANIMALS!5. It dosent easily get repetitive (Play for short incriments each day. This way, u wont ""Burn Out"" And you can play for years and see all the cool new stuff each day.6. It comes w/ a free memory card7. Its only $20 bucks!"
5,My Animal Crossing Review,"This game is very fun. You can make your own town, create your own character, decorate your house, and earn money to make your house bigger and better. I like being able to make friends."
4,Animal Crossing you say?,"Animal Crossing is not for everyone... you can lose track of time very quickly on this game. But for those with plenty of time on their hands, it's a great game! You can do nearly anything at any time you want to. From fishing at 2 o'clock in the morning, to decorating to your house. With all the expansions you can get for your house the fun never stops."
2,Piecing,"By piecing the leather, the result is a thicker product. I also do not remember the item being this large in past years"
4,you get for what you pay,"I had a hard time for few days to set all my TV, DVD/VHS combo, home theater and cable boxI still am not able to turn on/off and rev./forw. my samsung DVD player!but for the price it is a great deal since I do not need to have all my 4 remote controllers on my sofa."
4,Great remote for Tivo,This remote is great I have a direct TV tivo and with a little bit of searching around the Internet I was able to have all the buttons work and do what they needed to do.I was even able to control my stereo and I can do some things on this remote that I can't do with the remote provided by the stereo like selecting video2 with the remote came with the stereo I can only select video 1.
4,Remote works as detailed....,I bought this remote to run an older model Sony TIVO unit. Works great! All the buttons are mapped correctly and took only a few minutes to program this remote to work the DVR and TV as well as a DVD and VCR. Had to dig a little to find the commands to lock the volume control to the TV no matter what device was selected.
3,Not Universal,"This is supposed to be a universal remote. But it did not work on the insignia tv I had in my dorm room. As to advertising it as universal, they should be clear about what models the remote is NOT compatible with so I don't waste time buying a remote that won't connect with my tv.It was fast shipping though."
1,OBSOLETE...as others have pointed out.,"Bought via [...] for [...] shipping. Looks like I wasted a few bucks. The remote can't control my 3 year old Vizio LCD TV, my 2 year old Yamaha receiver or my 1 year old Samsung blu-ray player. It does work for my Motorola cable box, but my cable remote will, at least, also control my tv. Get something contemporary unless you have a bunch of 5 year old equipment."
2,Obselete remote control,"Bad idea when i decided to buy this remote control.I hadn't paid attention that the URC6131 doesn't have one of the most important feature i consider in a remote control: the ability to learn with new IR devices.I have recently bought a Sony blueray and a yamaha receiver, and both of them didn't work with the URC6131. Only my 3 yr old LCD Philips TV worked. useless for me, since i have 3 equipments and still need 3 remote control. Waste of money!!!"
3,Good enough!,"I use this remote for TV, DVD Player and Audio Player. There are more functions but time is money..."
4,Great Value and Function,"This remote is very easy to set-up. I ordered this remote to replace my older model Kenwood audio receiver remote and was pleased to find out that it was programmed to switch between inputs on my receiver. I didn't see any reviews that addressed this. Unfortunately, it does this with the numeric keypad, which requires the memorization of which input corresponds to which number. But, a cheaper alternative than OEM replacement remotes, plus the benfit of reducing the multi-remote clutter down to one remote. It does not do everything that the old receiver remote did, but has enough function for my use. This really does work as adverised and is verry easy to set-up."
5,Worked right out of the package. No setup required in my case.,I love this remote.I was afraid that having a NON-TIVO brand unit (Toshiba brand TIVO unit) would require lots of setup (testing dozens of codes before finding the right one).Mine worked just as soon as I put batteries into the unit.The buttons are quite intuitive; I never used the user's manual yet.A real winner.An inexpensive replacement for the real unit.
1,URC Upgardeable Remmote,"I was disappointed as contrary to the PR, the remote did not recognize my Onkyo receiver, purchased several months ago. I called and was told that it needed upgrading to deal with this Onkyo Model (notwithstanding that the remotes were newly acquired-- already out of date).At MY expense and effort, I have mailed them to Ohio and hope they get returned fixed. The problem resolution phone line and information provided worked quite well. But I do not think this is 1st class treatment."
1,Not worth the low price,"This remote is not all the other reviews claim it is. It does not perform many functions of my HD Tivo as stated. The info button does nothing nor does the guide. And really what good is that if you can't see whats on TV? It also does not operate the menu option for my TV so I am still left using 3 remotes for my TV, DVD, and Tivo. It is destined to spend eternity in a junk drawer because it would not be worth returning considering the shipping charges for receiving and returning. I DO NOT recommend this remote to any one considering it."
2,Doesn't work with my TIVO,"I couldn't get the remote to work with my TIVO. That is why I purchased it,"
3,Does not use AA's,Just bought two of these remotes because they are the only multi device ones (that supported tivo) that used AA batteries. Unfortunatly the description is wrong the remotes that were sent to me uses 2 AAA batteries. So I'm off the store to get rechargable AAA batteries. Other then that this remote rocks I got it controlling all my devices completly (except my yamaha reciever but it control volume and mute good enough)
1,Doesn't work,"After reading all the good comments, I went out and got one of these today. None of the codes would even turn on my Tivo Series II.It would turn on and operate most of my TV (Samsung HCL4715W) functions - except for one very important one. It would bring up the TV/Video screen, but then there was no way to navigate or select a new video source.It also would turn on an operate the basic controls of my Bose 3-2-1 system. But, as with the TV, it had no means of switching between sources.Bottom line, this thing was near useless. I am taking it back to the store tomorrow in hopes of getting a refund."
1,Bad Instincts,"This book has been called ""the Devil Wears Prada for vegans"" numerous times, and what an apt comparison; ""Animal Instinct"" is just as poorly written and completely uninteresting---an embarrassment, in my opinion, to writers everywhere. Also like ""The Devil Wears Prada,"" this book is a thinly-veiled attempt at revenge, and for what I am not certain. What both of these books make painfully clear: a ""fictional"" novel is no place for airing dirty laundry, unless, of course, one possesses the actual ability to write. Otherwise, Ms. Hayes might have kept this banal tale locked within the pages of a journal; this story is not interesting enough for mass consumption."
1,This Book Needed an Editor!,"The story of ""Twenty-First North Pole Santa"" is excruciatingly politically correct (if I had to read about the main character's ""proud Athabascan heritage"" one more time I was going to scream), but that's not why I've given it a low rating. I'm giving it a low rating because the book seriously needed an editor who was competent of grammar and style. It obviously didn't have one. Zahn is a repetitive and choppy author; and she apparently doesn't know what a question mark is or how it is used to indicate an interrogative sentence. This is not of publishable quality.I bought this book for my young son, but I don't know that I'll let him keep it. The story is no great shakes, and the writing itself is subpar. I don't want him to think that this is good authorship!"
1,This DVD will make you dumb.,"Hands down the worst official band DVD I've ever seen. The live performances are just collages with the studio version played over top. Then you got to watch these losers be idiots for what seems like 5 hours. I kind of liked this band before, now I have quite a different opinion. Buy this if you like absolute crap and to waste your time."
4,Space saving and washer friendly,"Bought this from a non-Amazon vendor and have been very pleased with it. Besides the large cutting space when folded out, it can be closed and cut on the half-size surfaces as well. And, because of the fold, we have found we can put it in the bottom section of our dishwasher, slightly ajar to allow the washer to clean inside the board and out. Overall a great buy."
1,hated it,"I didn't like this book one bit! i never could really put my mind on it, and in the end i was really didn't understand what happened. Its a wierd story, unlike the others, even though i don't care for the American girl mystery, "" danger at the zoo"". I wouldn't get this book if i were you. Hope i helped!!!"
1,WARNING,"Many, many tears have been shed over this book by my nine year old daughter. For reasons I do not understand...reasons that were completely unrelated to the storyline, a little dog that Kaya adores is killed by a cougar. There is absolutely no need to put this in the book. There are plenty of dead dogs in other books such as Where the Red Fern Grows for children to read when they are older, but why would anyone writing for little girls need to add this disturbing part of the book??"
2,"High quality paper, not so great everywhere else",For the money you can get much better notebooks. For $7.99 this notebook just wasn't that great. The paper quality was fantastic but not so much better than other notebooks to warrant this price. It isn't even hardback. And it only has 80 pages. That's 10 cents a PAGE. Really not worth it.
2,Presenting his own prejudice,"While an excellent writer in the short story form, this book is more involved in trashing other people's work that teaching anything and I question his qualifications (considering his own lack of success with novels) to teach how to write them.Comments such as this: ""Nonart, genre writing, entertainment writing, is typically filled with abstraction, generalization, summary, analysis, and interpretation."" show at best a non-acquaintance with genre writing and an assumption that ALL genre-writing is ""non-art"". Well, thank you very much but he could learn a thing or two from one heck of a lot of genre writers.I've seen a lot of literary writing that was distinctly non-art although the WRITER obviously thought highly of their navel gazing--his novels fall into that category.Which isn't to say there aren't some good passages in this book but frankly there are better books on fiction writing elsewhere."
2,Caveat Emptor,"This first half of the book had some good insights.It became clear after a couple of pages that the book was a transcription of one of his actual workshops. Butler does not write this book, he TALKS this book.Then the second half was full of student essays, which he then critques. It was painful to read most of them and even more excruciating to read the critiques.Honestly, although I did get some good concepts, for the most part I felt ripped off.If you are going to sell a book by claiming that you are a Pulitzer-prize winning author, the least you could do is write some of it."
2,after two wearings it pilled,Looked great but then my son wore it to school and I thought he had leaned up against a brick wall because the whole back had pilled like it was scraped up against a wall. My son said he had not ......anyway I am disappointed in the quality.
3,Coarsely made,"It looks good and there is fleece. However, I found it coarsely made. There are strings everywhere making it very bad..."
5,A bargain,"It is a good quality hoodie with reasonable price. Although it does not fit me well, but I guess it's normal for a sweater. There is only one strange thing for me, the zipper is opposite, the lock is on right hand side, while it is on the left hand side for every sweater I have."
1,horrible,"the picture showed it as all black not with a grey logo ,if amazon is going to sell this product they should put the write picture"
1,Lightweight,"I was hoping for something heavy weight and this definitely isn't. It's a nice sweatshirt for what it is, but definitely not what I had in mind. I'll be returning them."
4,Nice Jacker,I bought this for my husband and he is very pleased with it. The quality is excellent and the color (granite heather) is very attractive. It runs large which is why I purchased it. It fits him perfectly.
5,Does the job...,wanted a cheap hoodie to wear after working out to keep me warm and it does just that...
1,"For Black Hoodie, Image Doesn't Match Product","The image for the black/large hoodie showed a black lining in the hood. However, the one that arrived had a grey lining. Not what I ordered. Amazon needs to fix this detail page so people know what they're getting."
4,Great hoodie!,"Great hoodie!.. will keep you very warm. It seems to run a little large, so may want to order a size smaller. Very pleased with my purchase."
3,Not a Heavyweight,"This wasn't nearly as heavy as the SouthPole hoodie it was replacing. I love the champion name but now that they have partnered with Target, etc and now make their ""C9"" line, their quality overall has gone down."
3,Champion Fleece hooded sweat shirt,I ordered (2) of these relatively cheap sweaters. Got what I paid for - they are not pre-washed - got red lint all over shirts underneath til after the first few washings. The zipper is functional - but very rough feeling with sharp teeth - I guess that will wear in. Stitching seems fine and it is warm - just what I needed. I would rate this sweater functional - but a higher quality smooth zipper and prewashing would make it a much better value with little extra expense. I am slightly concerned with the zipper roughness - acts like it will jam easily - But I've used for a month with no troubles.
4,NOT AS PICTURED,THIS IS A CHAMPION SWEAT BUT THE COLORS ARE NOT ACCURATE IN PICTURE.GREY LINING AND OUTSIDE COLOR IS MORE BURGUNDY.STILL GOOD QUALITY BUT THATS THE BRAND.PRICE IS VERY GOOD IF COLOR IS NOT YOUR ISSUE.
4,Hoodie,"Product meets my expectations, especially like that the zipper ends where the hood starts allowing for coverage of my neck in front of sweatshirt."
3,Decent,"It's a decent sweatshirt, nothing that great though, kind of warm, it was good for my purpose: my grandpa's present-layer some clothes underneath and it'll be fine."
2,Comfortable but...,Comfortable but the sizes came MUCH bigger than I expected. I will try to shrink it but make sure you order a size smaller.
4,nice hoodie- order a size smaller!,"I read the reviews stating to order a size smaller, heed that advice. I was hesitant and went with a large. The Large hoodie that arrived would fit someone 6 foot 2 260 pounds no problem. Unfortunately that is too big for me.I am going to wash it warm the first couple times and it should shrink up a little. Wish I went with the medium but not going to send it back. The garnet colored hoodie does have a grey lining for the hood. Good deal at the price I paid, and being a little big on me is ok, I can always layer up under it on the colder days."
1,NOT FOR MIDDLE SCHOOL,"I work in a bookstore, and this book was ordered by middle school teachers in a large quantity to stimulate reading and writing among their (very low income population) students. However, the graphic nature and words used in this book were wildly inappropriate for their students, and they returned the entire order. The teachers (who have heard it all, I am sure), would not allow this in their classrooms. Just because this book has rave reviews does not make it a great book or as age-appropriate as the description would make it out to be."
2,Too bad about the bad language,"It's nice that a book can share writings by teenage boys so all can read about their pain or praise, but I was dumbfounded to see that several writings were included that had terrible language. I research books before I purchase them, and not one review mentioned the bad language. I have had this book in my library for several years, but just recently found the language. I am withdrawing it right away."
3,Just ok -,too many pills to take -and I'm not sure if I got the desired results. Might work for someone else.
2,Nice looking but...,"I bought these spines to try to improve the looks on my delivered documents.They are very easy to use and re-use (in case you need to make changes) and they look great! The big problem I find with it is that they take up most of the hole created to insert them, which makes it very difficult to flip pages.I have tried with several customers at different meetings and they where all annoyed with the fact that they couldn't flip the pages with ease.I hope they come up with the same design with a slightly slimmer model."
2,"disappointing, at best","I wanted to really love this album. I'm a huge fan of Katell's, having seen her a number of times. ""O Seasons"" and ""Jet"" are two of my favorite albums of all time.If you've seen her at all live over the past few years or bought the ""The Only Thing Worse..."" EP, there will be no surprises on this ablum.There are a few songs which are really great, such as ""The Only Thing Worse..."", ""Beautiful Day"", and ""Brother of the Brush"". However, most of the other songs are meandering and boring, especially ""7 League Boots"".Overall, this album lacks a polish that was present on her other albums. The mixing is off by quite a bit. When listening to the album, some of the tracks get lost due to their low volume if you're listening in the car, for example.I can't wait for her next album."
5,Echo Park Readers say YEAH!,"Just added this book to my Echo Park Listmania ECHO PARK LOVES YOU, CARRIE ASAI... since our 'hood n library is featured! AND WE LOVE THE BOOK... our readers here are hooked. Her books do not stay on the shelf! Just for the record, Asai had visited our library some years ago, what a super nice person. And now I see, an extremely talented author. THANK YOU!"
1,I wish this were a joke,"This book is an example of the sum of every Japaneses stereotype rolled up into something that attempts to tell a story. Everyone in Japan is not a ninja, a samurai, a yakuza, or related to a powerful businessman. I know that books are an escape from reality, but I would rather have a brain aneurysm or enter a deep coma to escape from reality than read this book. The author obviously knows nothing about Japan or it's culture. If you think you will learn anything by reading this book you are wrong, you are only helping perpetuate stereotypes.I only hope that the author is playing some cruel trick on the world, and she is creating a series steeped in ignorance to show us all how dumb we really are when it comes to other cultures."
2,samurai girl,"the main character annoyed me alot, i kept wishing that Karen would beat her into a bloody smear while sparring. i think that to most if not all readers will find it impossiable to relate in any way to Heaven. i found myself frustrated at how sheltered and spoiled she was even at 19. anyways the books a bit ridiculous but a semi-fun read."
5,The New Series That'll Have You Hooked By Chapter Two...,"So, the summer began and I found myself in a state of bordom. Having done all my required summer reading, I decided to stop by the book store. Looking through the aisles nothing really caught my attention until I landed in the Young Adult section. Skimming through the selves, I soon find myself face to face with this book. I debated with myself for awhile and finally ended up buying it. While looking for a escape from my boredom, I had stumbled upon a excellent book. I was hooked after the first chapter. I finished it in about 2 and half hours. And had the second book in my hands by the next afternoon. This book has everything love, lost, sacrifice, romance, action, failure, triumph, drama, among many other things. I would recommend this book to anyone. And if your debating on whether or not you should buy this book, stop, and BUY IT!!.....You won't regret it!!!...I promise!!..."
2,"Samurai Girl Grazes, But Doesn't K.O.","Samurai Girl is a great idea for a novel. And the plot begins well, but as the first book in the series, it feels too much like a teaser and not a stand alone book. Great insight into a girl's thought process and even into the cultural aspects of her life/family. However, some essential plot features were never answered in this book: what did her father want to tell her? And much of the book seemed to meander to it's climatic ending. Yes, it makes me want to get the next book to find out these answers, but not because I was satisfied with this story."
4,Great workshop heat,"I bought this heater for my garage woodworking hobby shop back in 1996. This workshop was a 2-1/2 car detached garage with insulation on the underside of the roof - meaning there was ALOT of cubic feet in that building to heat on cold Indiana winter nights. Although the building was only insulated with r-11 fiberglass, there were days when it was 20 degrees or less outside and I was working in a longsleeved t-shirt and jeans in my workshop. I found that on a full tank of fuel this heater would go for about 8-9 hours. I wish that capacity was double that, but oh well.The only serious downsides to this thing in my book stem from the nature of kerosene heat and not the heater itself. No matter how clean the fuel is, kerosene heat inevitable produces a smell. It was fine in a workshop but the few times I brought this thing into the house it smelled pretty bad...If you are looking for kerosene heat though, this is a quality model that can be had at a pretty good price."
1,Dangerous junk,My whole house filled with smoke. The smell was obnoxious and not worth the heat that came out. Now I have a severe headache from the smell.
1,Built in Obsolescence,"I have owned a Dyna Glo heater for ten years, I always found changing the wick difficult to say the least. I purchased a new RMC 95-C6 last year and after 3 uses the wick needed changing so I thought it was simply a bum wick. I took the heater to a certified repair facility in Charlotte and was told there was simply no way to replace the wick. This heater also requires dry burns or a full maintenance check at a Dyna Glo official repair site every two tanks (that is 1 days operation). I called the Mfg. and was told by customer service that I should not purchase another Dyna Gol heater because they have multiple manufacturers building their products and Dyna Glo will not stand behind them. I was told not to purchase another Dyna Glo heater because they didn't trust their own product. I hope that help you avoid this POS."
1,LG VX6000 battery,I was extremely disappointed in this product. The battery did not give full contact with my phone and therefore I did not get correct connection. It also did not fit properly in the phone charger. It's best to purchase the battery through LG directly.
1,Great product but no tank,This product did not come with a tank so I returned it and bought one that did. It did look good but a tank was several hundreds more.
2,Great when it works,I've had the same experience as noted by others. Purchased in 2005. When it works it's great.. and it is one of the better looking models I've seen. however I have already gone through two tanks due to leaks...I've also had to repair water damage under the sink twice now.So far the dispenser has been working fine. However because of the tanks failing there has been about 2 years when the dispenser has rested unused. The good news is that they are sending me a new tank free of charge even though I am about a year out of warranty on the second tank. I like this manufacturer but I would suggest a different model.
2,Avoid it,"My experience mimics that of most others here - first the tank failed (after about 2 years) and started spraying hot water under the sink. After 6 years, one of the levers on the dispenser would not shut off. Sounds like the 'worn seat' description. I'm replacing the system with a cheaper one that has a handle that looks more like a bathroom sink faucet - not as 'elegant' but of sturdier construction"
3,"No trouble with dispensor yet, will fix/replace when needed.","Bought this 5/2007 and had installed during kitchen remodel. Like it alot. Had trouble with the heater tank unit leaking at its internal vinyl tube; fixed by replacing with a silicone tube (see reviews for the tank). Have not had any problems with the dispenser yet, but plan to fix/replace it if/when it happens. My family likes and uses this enough that it will be worth doing. It is a shame that the product has had a poor reliability record, and that repair parts cannot be purchased."
3,Cold water handle seized up,"My cold water handle seized up 2.5 years after it was initially installed. Rather than follow the detailed instructions provided by other reviewers for disassembling and cleaning the piston/cassette, I soaked a paper towel in acetic acid/clear vinegar and wrapped the base of the cold water handle with it overnights, so that the vinegar could make its way down. I removed it the next morning and it's been good for the last 3 weeks.You could probably apply the weak acid (or other decalcifying agent) directly to the hole which the handle projects from, but I have marble countertop and didn't have an eye dropper handy, so I used the paper towel approach to avoid dissolving the marble. If it seizes up again, I'll try the disassembly approach provided by the other reviewers."
1,Very poor quality,"Very poor quality - not recommended. I had two huge problems:1) The water valve stuck open (drip, drip, drip). Happened in 1st year, under warranty; then happened a 2nd time!!! After 2 free replacements: it finally worked.2) At 3 years old: plastic 1/2 gallon tank sprang a leak!! I'm trying to repair it now (to save $350 new purchase cost). This is mind-boggling. How can a plumbing-fixture company build a water tank that leaks? Mind you: these tanks are NOT under pressure! Water pressure is applied only when you press the dispensing lever, and even then the pressure in the tank is low.I see from some other posts that they are now going with a stainless steel tank: I guess so many plastic tanks failed they changed the design. Geez."
2,I Agree - My Troubles and a low cost solution,I agree...this is not the best system around....1-Installed in 2005.2-Plastic tank failed 1 month out of warranty - replaced with stainless (my cost).3-Stainless failed (would not heat) - replaced (my cost).4-Faucet (hot side) failed.Seems the faucet design is designed to fail with no replacement parts - NOT a good design!Called In-Sink Erator - they offered a replacement faucet at much less than internet store prices (that helped).Overall....It's good when it works but be prepared for the issues we are all experiencing...
1,"poor, ripoff","Worst product we ever used. contantly sticks in off position Company needs to stand behind this product, they are making money on this crap. Springs just don't last"
1,"Great when it works, but very unreliable and not repairable.","Great when it works, but expensive and difficult to repair. I bought the best tank and dispenser Insinkerator sold in mid 2005 for $571. Tank died just after the one-year warranty expired. Insinkerator discounted a new better stainless steel tank to me for $80 which frustrated the hell out of me. Then after 3 years the hot water dispenser (handle) would no longer turn off. Insinkerator customer support told me it is past the one-year warranty and not repairable (newer models have a 3 or 5 year warranty). They told me to spend $200-300 on a new facucet (dispenser). Based on some Internet blogs I found I'm going to take it apart and clean the oddball sized washers and springs and hope it works."
3,jones,"I purchased this hot water unit four years ago. It was nearly $200 to have it installed. Now the tank is leaking from the electrical cord on the bottom and I have to replace it. The tank costs as much as the entire unit.While I had it I loved it, but its short life makes for a huge diappointment and very expensive for hot water. It should come with a ten-year replacement warranty at the least. I see that nearly everyone on this website has had the same poor turnout.Shame on you In-Sink-Erator."
1,insinkerator hot water dispenser,"We have owned this F-HC1100SN for less than a year. The faucet portion now leaks and theire is no way to replace without buying the entire unit for $284.00! Since we bought it online, returning it will be very difficult. My recommendation is not to buy this unit. BTW installation was difficult too."
2,Repair cost is excessive,"We have owned this product (actually the satin finish version F-HC1100SN) for just over three years and had been happy with the dispenser until recently. Repair parts are not available. Even something as simple as a leaky fitting means that you have to buy a whole new assembly.We had such a leaky fitting and had to replace the entire tank assembly. Fortunately, this happened while still under warranty. More recently, the spacer under the cold water lever wore to the point that it would no longer stay in the detent. The spacer is not available, nor is the cold water cartridge. Our only option is to replace the entire faucet assembly at a cost of $285.My recommendation is to look for a unit that has repair parts available, either from the manufacturer or aftermarket."
2,Same problem w/ the stuck hot - vinegar fixed it,"Thanks to whoever's brainstorm it was to use vinegar, I was able to unstick the stuck-open hot water tap.I poured plain white vinegar into the top of the top without taking anything apart. Less than 5 minutes later I wiggled the lever to its extremes a few times and plop it came unstuck. I let it soak longer, did some more wiggling, then flushed with water (still w/out taking anything apart). Et Viola.I also did some back of the envelope calculations on what I pay a year to power this thing. I figured it to be about $40/year or so FWIW."

Our only option is to replace the entire faucet assembly at a cost of $285 (price quoted from the mfgr's parts dept.).My recommendation is to look for a unit that has repair parts available, either from the manufacturer or aftermarket."
1,"Poor reliability, cannot be repaired by homeowner","Great when it works, but expensive and difficult to repair. I bought the best tank and dispenser Insinkerator sold in mid 2005 for $571. Tank died just after the one-year warranty expired. Insinkerator discounted a new better stainless steel tank to me for $80 which frustrated the hell out of me. Then after 3 years the hot water dispenser (handle) would no longer turn off. Insinkerator customer support told me it is past the one-year warranty and not repairable (newer models have a 3 or 5 year warranty). They told me to spend $200-300 on a new facucet (dispenser). I've been unable to dismantle it and repair whatever springs or washers are broken. Read reviews for other 1100's and you'll see lots of dissatisfied people."
1,Failure common just outside of warranty,"A nice product when it works, but expect both the tank and the faucet to fail in an unacceptably short period of time -- but probably last just long enough to void the warranty."
1,Insinkerterrible - died at age 2!,"What a piece of junk. This stupid hot water tap lasted less than two years. Then, after the warranty had expired...naturally, the tank began to leak. We were told by Insinkerator customer service to replace the tank because that model was no longer available OR repairable. When we received the new tank, the fittings wouldn't work correctly.Save yourself a LOT of grief. Companies like Insinkerator are why so many consumers are migrating to products made OUTSIDE the United States because apparently American products are no longer reliable.Terrible.InSinkErator F-HC1100SN Indulge Contemporary Hot and Cold Water Dispenser, Satin NickelInSinkErator SST-FLTR 2/3-Gallon Stainless Tank and Filtration System"
3,Hopeful,I had to replace my original In-Sinkerator after 18 months. After receiving no warranty help or parts support from the manufacturer I decided to give them one more chance... they now have some sort of 5 year warranty. Their under the sink concept is great and they have very little competition. I gave them 3 stars for hope.
2,A leaky faucet!,As I write this I am listening to the incessant dripping of an Insinkerator F-HC1100 Designer Series hot/cold faucet. I have had two simpler Insinkerator faucets in the past with no problems. Reading the experience of others it appears that this is unfortunately a poorly designed or manufactured product. (It looks good though!)
1,Zero stars - Have had 3 units fail now,"As others have already mentioned:1. The valves eventually get stuck in the ON position. When this happens, the handles just flap back and forth, and water keeps flowing through the unit until you turn off the water supply to the unit.2. It is impossible to repair--no matter if you are a handy homeowner or a plumbing professional--so you are required to replace the whole dispenser assembly at a cost of $250-300.I have three of these units installed. All three of them have failed!BTW, my plumber doesn't normally deal with this crap brand, and his wholesaler can't get it for less than $300.I am replacing one of these units, but the other two that have failed are being permanently retired."
2,REPLACEMENT PARTS,WE HAVE INSTALLED NEW COUNTERTOPS AN NEED NEW LONGER LINES FOR THE HOT WATER DISPENSER. THE PEOPLE AT THE HELP LINE WERE OF NO HELP. I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO FIND THESE HIGH TEMPTURE LINES AT THE LOCAL HARDWARE STORES.
3,"Worked great for 8 years, and InSinkErator did accommodate","After using this product pretty heavily for 8 years, the seal around the lever started leaking a little bit, but before I could replace that, it started leaking a LOT from the heating unit, so I replaced it with the new, larger heater. I then asked about replacement parts for the faucet and they said buy a new one (as others have noted - quite annoying!). After complaining about the fact that it was going to cost me nearly $600 to replace both units, they replaced the faucet component F-HC1100SN free with a full 5 year warranty."
2,not up to stuff,"This product never worked great for us. The hot works ok, it dispenses reasonably hot water as expected. The cold didn't flow fast enough for my taste since it was installed. after the 3rd filter, so about 1.5 years the cold stopped working altogether. I'm not too happy, not sure what I'll use for replacement."
1,Mine broke after normal use,Mine broke after normal useDissaponiting in something that costs so nuch money. The amazing thing is there is so little competition.
1,Most worthless item I have ever owned,"I purchased my first hot water dispenser because my wife enjoys hot tea. Within one year it leaked profusely. Tank was replaced under warranty. About two years later the second tank leaked. I foolishly purchased a replacement because it was out of warranty. That one lasted a little over a year (note, this is good Denver city water and not well water which could be corrosive). We have now moved to Branson, MO and the home had an Insinkerator hot water dispenser which the owner said that he had to replace just before we purchased it because the tank leaked. Now, just under two years later I find that this tank also leaks. I find it amazing that they can continue to sell this defective product!"
1,Very poor quality,"I first installed this unit at a full kitchen remodel in 2003. Since that time, I have replaced the tank 3 times (I am on my 4th) and the faucet once (and it is dying again). The faucet works only with the ISE tank. ISE has supplied the occasional replacement unit but never offered me the now touted in-home repair service. The original design heater had a polypropylene tank which degraded and made the water taste foul. When it developed a leak, I had to buy a replacement that they redesigned it with a stainless tank. This developed a leak in shortly over 3 years. ISE replaced it with yet another new design that eliminated the source of the previous leak. This is the only appliance that I have had to replace in nearly 10 years."
1,Defective,We ordered this item as a replacement for a 6-7 year old unit that began to leak. It came missing the parts kit which I requested from the manufacturer. Finally I installed the new unit and discovered that it leaked at the hot water lever and aerator. When I called the manufacturer they asked for the serial number which is supposed to be on the blue inlet tube but was not present. I was able to get a warranty call from my local representative. They were able to return it to the manufacturer. The new item was installed and works great. We like this item and use it almost every day for tea and drinking water. It seems like the item shipped was a used item with its defects and serial number removed.
1,Don't Buy It! Very Poor Quality. Product will fail after a few years.,"I loved this product when it worked. It is very convenient but not worth the trouble and cost.I am on my second set of Insinkerator hot water dispenser & hot water heater in less than 9 years. The levers on the faucet failed on both units and both heating units leaked. Consider the water damage from the leaking water tank unit, replacement and installation costs you will incur when buying this product. We have spent over $1,400 on installation, replacement and repair of this product. It's not worth it."
1,Doomed to Failure,"We had the same problems as so many others have written about. We had this unit installed in a house we built in 2005. After 2 1/2 years the tank began leaking. It was impossible to repair and we ended up replacing it with one of Insinkerator's ""new improved"" stainless steel tank. As we were out of warranty we had to pay for this (although ISE did give us a slight reduction in price). Now after another 2 years the handles went limp and failed to shut off the water flow. I followed the directions from 'R Mac' and 'Believe in Jesus' (thank you so much) - and now the faucet is back working (how long is anyone's guess - but I now know how to repair it). I would never buy this unit again, and in fact I recently replaced an ISE Badger disposal unit with a less expensive and more reliable Waste King. It's amazing that ISE stays in business with their shoddy products and horrible customer service."
1,I am not happy with this product,"We remodeled our home about 5 years ago. We wanted the instant hot water device installed. we purchased a In sink erator. we had the unit for about 2 years when it broke the first time. We have had to replace it twice. The fist time the handle at the dispenser stopped working. They said the warranty was only one year so we had to pay for the replacement unit. We purchased the new unit and two and a half years go by and now we have to replace it again. We were told that there was a five year warranty we we purchased the new unit. When we found the leak this time I called their number on the device. They will send me a new unit, but we have to pay to replace it. They know they do not make a product that will last but obviously they do not care. Think twice about buying this unit. Find another manufacturer."
1,InSinkErator F-HC1100C Hot and Cold,Very poor design by insink's engineering department and very poor customer relations. My original unit was purchased in 2004 and fails to turn off. The replacements parts are no where to be found. InSinkErator should get in touch with customer loyalty and design a better product and a ten year warranty.
1,A $600 system broke in 1 year,Mine broke after 1 year. The hot water tap got stuck. I called the company and they would not fix it because I could not give them the serial# (my installer might unknowingly removed and disgarded the serial# when he installed the system). Not worth the money! I have gone and trying another brand/design last month.
5,Great resource!!,This book is a great resource for anyone who needs to improve communication and relationship skills. I am a teacher of young adults and older teens (ages 16-19) who have autism spectrum disorders and this book is great! I also bought a copy for my husband to read and use in his management practices -- it is probably even more relevant in that setting. Overall a great book -- easy to read and implement!
3,"Great for basic communication skills, not so good ath public skills",This book is great for personal communications skills. It reveals many of the mistakes we all make in our personal communications. I didn't like the second half of the book which talked about social communication skills.
3,Very short,"This is a very small/short book that serves better as an overview prior to your trip. There is some good, very general information, but nothing very specific."
1,Cheap is Cheap,"Ok so I bought this remote in January and retuned it after 2 days of use. Not only was the programing tedious (and notice I said tedious and not hard) but the unit lost the codes after some time. NOT a battery problem or a defective unit. Buy a romote thats USB programable, it might cost you a $100 or so but I guaraantee its worth it"
4,"Great functionality, almost perfect execution","In agreement with most reviewers, my chief complaint is the battery life. The remote acts really funny once the batteries are low. I use lithiums and they generally last about 6 months. Since I have the original model (9960), I cannot disable the tilt switch (motion activated backlight) using the 985 hack. An operator informed me that model 9960B01 has this capability.My first remote died after a few months, I exchanged it and the second one has been fine for a few years now.Their modem upgrade procedure is quite interesting since it doesn't upgdate the entire database, but rather adds new codes for devices you request when you call.While I can appreciate the soft-configured nature of the control, having used this remote I would opt for a split layout with part of the keyboard having conventional buttons. (at least Volume, ch up/down). These keys are used all the time and having no tactile feedback for them means you don't know where you fingers are."
4,Good and Bad to consider,"1st, it eats batteries like the oher reviewers said, but you can either set the motion sensor to off, or set it o the table. Keeping it still dramatically extends battery life.2nd, there aren't enough extra buttons. It was a pain in the *ss to get my a,b,c buttons to work, and I can't turn ON my stereo, but I can turn it off. I am sure there is a way around that, but I haven't gotten that far yet.Otherwise, this is a great remote."
2,Works well but is a battery hog!,"The remote is great for tying up all the programming of several remotes in one, but like the other reviewers said, it is sensitive to movement. I can no longer leave it on the couch or coffee table because it lights up and drains the batteries whenever I walk into the livingroom. It was, and still is, a waste of money considering I have to replace all 4 AAA batteries every 2 months! I am considering model URC-8811 which has no LCD display whatsoever. That should take care of the battery issue."
2,nice remote but.....,"It is so sensitive a cat walking by the coffee table turns it on, and in turn runs down the batteries. If you are ok with buying Cosco packs of ""AAA"" batteries monthy then this is your remote... Me I am in the Market for a new one."
3,"Good, but not great","I've had my Kameleon for about a year. Overall, I like it. It was easy to program, the macros are handy. Visually it's outstanding, and it's feel in the hand is great. The construction quality is also outstanding.The downsides however slightly out weigh the positives in my opinion. First, as everyone has pointed out, is battery life. People who say they are getting a week on a set of bateries must be using cheap batteries. I typically get about two to three weeks on a set of NiMH rechargables. This is annoying, but not that big of a deal.The big problem as far as I'm concerned is the lack of ""real"" buttons. Since you can't feel the buttons, you have to look at the remote to figure out where to press. Personally, I find it quite annoying.On the other hand, this is a great feature for the tech-phobic. Because the only buttons that are displayed are those that are needed by the current mode, this could be the perfect remote for those that are scared off by too many buttons."
2,Nice idea but flawed,"I really like the weight and feel of this remote. It was very easy to set up and the screen provided a very nice feedback. However if you turn off the wake on movement feature to save battery life, the ""buttons"" don't come on til you press them. Which means you have to guess at the location of the button you want pressed, if you guess wrong then the wrong button is pressed. A design where the the buttons don't work until they light up would have been much smarter. It sounds like a minor inconvenience, but if you have an HDTV, a home theater system, a seperate dvd player, and a seperate cabe/sattelite unit and you don't remember the last device you had active then you don't know what buttons are displayed. To prevent this annoyance you merely have to turn the wake on movement again, but this seriously drains the batteries."
2,Not all it's cracked up to be,"I have to agree with Beneluxboy. The vibration setting is so sensitive that it inhales batteries. After two years, my remote has started to act flakey, coming on when I don't want it to and barely coming on when I do want it to. This is a sign of low-battery usage, but I have replaced the batteries twice in 4 weeks. I have a battery tester and in each case, ""full"" batteries were sucked to ""empty"" within two weeks. While rechargable batteries would reduce the cost of replacing the batteries, I shouldn't have to recharge them so frequently.On the plus side, the display was very bright and easy to read. But once I got over the ""ooo"" and ""ahhh"" factor (animated pictographs, blue color, bright lights), I thought it was less user-friendly than the older models.I have since puchased a less glitzy One For All and am much happier with it."
2,Good Remote but eats batteries,This is a good remote but eats batteries. You must disable the motion sensor to extend the battery life. Cool remote and is upgradable via phone. The macro feature is good. However the feel of the membrane is not like the regular buttons. Used the remote for 6 months and sold it thru the Yahoo Auctions at half price.
3,Decent remote but not for me,"I had hoped this would be the solution to my home theater problems, but it wasn't to be.The remote certainly looks cool, and does a good job with the basics of each device (including my Tivo) however it still requires you to select a device and then hit buttons to control it - so to watch a movie I have to hit ""DVD"" then ""Power"" then ""Monitor"" then ""Power"" then ""Receiver"" then""Power"" then ""DVD-Multi""... I can do this but if you're less tech-savvy, you'll still need instructions, which defeats the purpose. The Harmony Remotes are more expensive but they can do this with one button press - I now have one and it is the real deal.Also - I agree with several of the other posters - the thing eats batteries - the glowing action is too sensitive and stays on almost all the time."
5,Great product,Get it to replace my damaged original control. It only took two minutes to find the code and make everything working. Great product.
4,I like it,"Some people complain about the battery life in this thing, but i use the 15 minute rechargables from rayovac and it doesn't bother me. Batteries need recharging about once or twice a month - no biggie. It does seem pretty sensitive to motion, it tends to come on even when it's on a solid surface and i walk by about 5 feet away. Overall it's a pretty cool product - i wish it had some more buttons (like delete for the PVR) and i wish macro programming were a bit more accessible/intuitive (still haven't figured that out, but haven't really spent any time at it). I like it, tho - all our stock remotes are in the drawer not getting used any more."
1,Display Annoying-- eats batteries like popcorn,"This remote lights up whenever it senses motion...If a kid drop a penny three states away, it lights up. This is just A LITTLE irritating when you have the lights off and are trying to watch a movie. OR when you are in the other room trying to sleep and no-one is in the TV room but you keep seeing this blue light, and just when you are about to awake screaming because the aliens have Come Back For You, you realize that the AC, the refrigerator kicking on , a flea fart, or some other thing has set the motion detector off on this thing. -- i have a somewhat wobbly glass coffee table and anything would make it go off... but even on other surfaces like the couch it was bad. OH and because of all this don't expect the batteries to last long... Other than that it was a great remote-easy to program-macros simple- great, ahem, display all that crap... Don't buy it."
1,"It Worked! It fixed the ""Sensitivity"" or ""eats batteries""","I too had the ""eats Batteries"" problem. That was until ROBO314159 came to the rescue. His fix of removing R34 on the board was exactly what I needed. His description was perfect and it worked like a charm! Highly recommend. The only tough part was the black housing removal. I started at the IR LED as it has a small area to get a driver in.Thanks again ROBO."
1,Very poor battery life!!!,"I got this remote with brand new brand-name alkaline batteries. This unit eats up all the batteries in just two week! I even had the backlight turned way down. Some reviewers here said just buy some expensive batteries, but why do I as a consumer need to accomodate a defective product?!After my poor experience, I just returned it to the store. Please refrain from buying it until they fixed the battery consumption problem."
1,invest in a battery company,yes it looks cool but this thing suxxxxxxxxx on battery life and by sux i mean 24 hours tops with *****NO USE**** I HAVE OWNED 2 . neither one held a charge .I even switched battery brands .this thing just flat out suxx.dont waste your money
4,Battery Drain from HELL,"Great remotePrograming is a snap and the learning factor sweet.But as with most of the reveiws, IT'S THE BATTERY DRAINER FROM HELL. This model does have the advantage of being able to turn the motion sensor off, so no need to cut any wires, but what's the point of not having this type of remote and not using the motion sensor. I've gone and purchased 2 sets of AAA high output nicad rechargables. They recharge in 15 minutes so when the annoying blinking from hell starts, I pop them in, and in a half hour I have 4 fresh batteries. Best case senario for this battery drainer."
4,I like this remote a lot,"I don't have a lot of experience with universal remotes. i got this one at circuit city.very attractive and clean design: no buttons at all when it is off. very comfortable to hold, and control with one hand, it's shape being very typical for a remote (unlike many learning remotes, such as the sony, which is too wide to control with one hand).it wakes up with movement, which is very easy, but it means you have to wiggle the remote before adjusting volume or changing channel. a bit repetitive.set up was easy, and controls my devices well, including my 5-disc dvd changer, and my Harmon-Kardon AVR125, although i cannot access all of the commands on the receiver (such as changing surround-sound settings). also, the receiver remote has separate on and off buttons, while the Kameleon's power button only turns it on.overall, i like it mostly because of it's excellent design. i wish it did a little better controlling my receiver, but i guess i can teach it a few commands."
2,ok but............,the whole idea behind my buying this item was to control my entire home theater system. after struggling with the information install it was discovered that the kameleon DOES NOT SUPPORT ANY DVD RECORDERS. be aware of this before plunking down any money for this item....very disappointing...
2,"Great concept, bad remote","I bought this remote with hopes for use with all my home theater devices. I liked the design and the ability to change the buttons and display based on the device it was controlling was very nice and a great idea. It managed to control all the devices I wanted. However, it had one major design flaw that caused it to wind up in the drawer forgotten. You see, the buttons on the remote light up in whatever configuration is needed based on the device it is attempting to control and when not in use, the device is black as the buttons aren't lit up. When you pick the remote up, it lights up based on the current configuration. However, the remote is so sensitive to movement that even someone walking through the room causes it to light up. This results in extremely poor battery life and what good is a remote if every week you are replacing the batteries.It's a cool design, but I would pass on this remote."
4,A great universal remote for the price,"This universal remote works very well. I was able to either enter the code or have it ""learn"" the functions of my other remotes. The only remote I could not get it to learn was my Bose Wave Radio. I've owned it about a month and I haven't had to replace the batteries. The only problem I had with the item was the fact that I had to turn off the automatic on function. Ideally, the remote will turn ""on"" when you pick it up but the slightest vibration was turning it on. Instead I just press the face of the touch screen and it goes on. Given that I got this nice little remote for $50 I'm satisfied with it and I can recommend it."
3,Review Follow-up,Try the resistor mod listed further down in the reviews section. The R34 removal does work as described and should fix the battery drain problem.
4,NO puzzles,This is an Excellent product. The software is well designed and intuitive. NO complaints from this Electronics Engineer!
4,"Excellent, well constructed radio!","This radio has exceeded my expectations. The radio is so well made, from the control knobs to the solid body construction. The sound is rich for a one speaker unit and has a pretty good frequency range. I bought this for the audio input for use of my Ipod which works wonderfully. The radio is somewhat heavy when loaded with batteries, but overall, I love it!"
5,Solid Reference Book & Solid Author,"You can't go wrong with Wayne Gisslen's books. After being introduced to his books in Culinary School (CHIC), he is still my point of reference for recipes & techniques. Anyone who wants to cook & present like a pro - can with this book's help. The book is wonderful!If culinary schools use him as their reference - why shouldn't you?"
5,Glorious Mudville,"Like some exotic spa bath, ""The Glory of Man..."" is a stimulating mix of creaminess and grit. Mudville have managed to create a vibe that pulses and throbs with real vitality and a whole lotta sweet soul, thanks to the absolutely sensuous, yet absolutely butch sounds emanating from singer Marilyn Carino. The songs here are full of life. While lyrically a bit impressionistic, they're all about hope and lust and color and a slap in the face to apathy. The sound is a clever mix of samples and live tracks, and the excellence of the musicianship and use of instruments such as standup bass, trumpet and piano makes it sound like a jazz record from some funky future. I was desperately looking for something different and genuinely GOOD. ""The Glory of Man..."" really turned me on."
5,In Vogue with savvy listeners,"This is a soulful,jazzy, trip-hoppy groove, that is worth many a listen. The lyrics are creatively poetic, with a voice that can be as beautiful, as it is sexy, and as soul-searching, as it is sure of itself. Songs all written by the singer, and masterfully played/etc. by Ben Rubin."
4,great new whitlams,"I really enjoy listening to this album, as I feel it is different to other whitlams albums. The Guitar is featured more and adds a great touch to the songs. My personal favorite tracks are ""Royal In The Afternoon"" & ""I Will Not Go Quietly"", these songs are fun to listen to and have great lyrics."
5,Get all three,"I walked into this one expecting the heavy/fuzz laden Buzzo sound.I was actually suprised by the way this came off.In a way this is far more laid back than i could have imagined from King B. With that said,I really like the way this album is put together.I dont want anyone to think this one doesent have its heavy spots...it definately does.Its just that this album shows why these three guys did the ""solo' thing anyway.Experimenting and showing an alternate side to your creativity.The first 3 songs rock and ,at times,are quite catchy little ditties.The last song is more of a joke put to music and features Dave grohl doing the vocal.All in all a very good purchase ,but i really think its best to get all three solo albums for the complete experience"
5,They just keep getting better and better,"With each CD at the end I say 'this is the best one yet' and then our girl puts out another one that I say it again and I did. How does she do it? Will she ever come home and share it with us? How did we allow her to get away? I'll never understand the music industry. The very few times I happen to switch over from talk radio and/or CD's to music, I start to cry because I realize she has so much more to offer or as much to offer as what I'm listening to on the radio. I get so angry, hurt and upset that I have to turn it off. There is no COUNTRY MUSIC JUSTICE in the USA. Do we understand why she had to leave - of course, but do we like it - of course NOT. Danni - we'll never forget how hard you tried and how hard you fought. There is no other like Danni Leigh if YOU want true country music. Then you need to order all of her CD's. You will NOT be disappointed in any of them! I dearly love my NEW FAVORITE CD! Our love to you from your hometown! xoxo"
3,Fast Paced Read,"Dillion, slowly seduces a young teen girl Lizzie, the high school drop out whom she has a crush on. Lizzie relationship with her mother is being interrupted by her mom's business trips. Making life even worse is `Rob the Slob' mom's pinhead boyfriend who coming between the two. Dillon's sexual and emotion seduction is like the light on the end of a tunnel for her. Lizzie runs away to live with him and ends up in the world of prostitution. She comes a prisoner in a drug dealer/pimp's, Barrel's, house. Although this is far from great writing and the plot is a little choppy, it will find it's way in teens' hands. This is part of a ORCA SOUNDING series which are very quick reads of realistic fiction."
1,"If You're Over 14, Beware","A friend gave it to me, implying I guess that she thinks I'm an ""uncommon woman."" So that was cool. But this book sounds like it was written, I swear, by one of my my ninth-grade students, without any editing. It is THAT trite. I cannot believe that this book was written by a woman in her early 30's. I can only conclude. . . . I don't know what to conclude. I find absolutely no insight in this slim volume. If you're 13 or 14, you might relate to some of what she says and the way she says it; otherwise just chat with a friend. You're bound to get something more original and helpful than what's in this book."
2,A disappointment,"Before reading this book, I was a big Wurtzel fan. In Prozac Nation, I finished the book feeling like I had a fair idea of who she was. I respected her. This book revealed to me that she is not at all what I'd formerly imagined. I got the feeling that this work was something she through together just for the purpose of making a few bucks and having another title under her belt. It is unlike not only Prozac Nation but all her other titles. I noticed a number of contradictions within this work. Personally, I was uninterested in taking any of her ""advice"" which I felt was lacking sincerity. There were also generalizations made by Wurtzel about women which I thought isolate were untrue, unfair, and far from feminist. If this book hadn't been written by Wurtzel, I'd most likely have stopped reading it midway. The only reason I completed it is because I was a fan of hers. I expected better."
1,simply awful,"Self-serving platitude heaped on self-serving platitude then served up as ""sass,"" from a spoiled, self-involved non-entity. Watch and enjoy as she, along with every other nineties excess, swirls into a well-deserved oblivion. Simply an awful --I hesitate to say ""writer"" --simply an awful phenomenon. Whoever mistook her for a role model deserves what they got. Another non-book from a talentless brat."
1,The WORST Book I've Ever Read...Seriously.,"While I pretty much liked Prozac Nation, Bitch, and More, Now & Again, this book was completely horrible. Everything about it is cliched. The writing is bad and trite and the advice is really just irritating. The advice is far from radical as well. If I flushed my money down the toilet it would have been better spent. If you are an uncommon woman and you want some commonsense advice, I would say don't spend your money on this trash. I think the only reason I read the whole book was because I couldn't believe how horrible it was. I'm personally offended that so many books don't get published, but this one did. What a waste."
3,Has Elizabeth Wurtzel been on Prozac too long?,"After reading _Prozac Nation_ and _Bitch,_ I considered myself a die-hard Elizabeth Wurtzel fan. Her passion and brutal honesty were refreshing and liberating. With _Radical Sanity_ I feel far less enlightened and some of her advice seems contrary to previous work. In the chapter entitled ""But Do Settle Down,"" I reread her words with puzzlement: ""You've been single long enough. You don't want your life to go into reruns, so stop the syndication deal before it starts. Enough. It's time to settle down. So find some good man and just do it. Just like that."" I searched for evidence of her bitter sarcasm, but she goes on to talk about 'true love' and the 'joy' and 'happy flow of life.' I'm all about the power of positive thinking myself, but miss the question-the-""rules""-around-you Elizabeth Wurtzel... This book seems more like something from *gasp* Oprah's Book Club!"
3,"A bit scatter brained, good book.","I always enjoy Elizabeth Wurtzel's books however this one seemed very poorly written. She seemed very scatterbrained through the entire book. This is her earlier writings and it is very apparent. The ""Common Sense"" advice given was vey banal. Cute book just not outlined correctly"
3,You get what you pay for,"At first this gun was working really well, but in the heat of battle, it started chopping more balls than a betrayed housewife.Okay, its not THAT bad, but it still isnt great. I keep it now as a spare if any of my friends want to give paintballing a try. Just a side note, you cant take off the barrel to clean it, you have to run the thingy through where the paintballs are fed into the gun, and out the barrel.What can I say? You get what you paid for"
5,"Great gun, low price","I got this gun a year ago, and it hasn't even jammed once. It shoots so fast that you can't even see it when you shoot it up in the air. I made my friend bleed when I shot him from 18 feet away. It goes about 290-300 fps, and is really heavy. I recomend you buy this gun from Airsplat, its only 18.99 there.P.S. Awesome!!!!"
4,slightly incredible,"When I first opened the package, I was thrilled. The gun looks awesome, when I fired it it was very powerful, and dented pop cans at around 25 yards. Later, when I used it in a simple ""yard skirmish"" (only the second time i shot it)the gun jammed from a part that had broken off under ordinary use. The part was easily removed and didnt make the gun useless, but I was less than impressed at its durability. The worst thing is, [...] advertised it as ""heavy duty"". if this is a heavy duty gun, than other ones might be useless. Overal, this gun is very powerful and accurate (I use .12),But not heavy duty."
1,Why are you advertising a calendar for 2004?,Why are you advertising a calendar for 2004? You can not be selling much. I'd like to buy this item but will it be 2009 or 2004?
5,The Bodyguards Story is Remarkable,"This a most fascinating book written by a stoic young man who not only endured horrific injuries in the car accident that shocked the world,but also faced unrelenting pressure from the media and eventually the anger of Mohammed Fayed.The story of the weeks preceding the accident of the relationship between Princess Diana and Dodi Fayed is told kindly as is the power and wealth of the Fayed.It,to my surprise an excellent read"
5,Remarkably Authentic,"It's a light, quick read that tells the story from the perspectives of Dodi Fayed's bodyguard, his family, his attorneys, and the surgeon who rebuilt his face. It puts paid to any possible assassination theory, and gives insight into how the dysfunctional culture of Mohammed Al Fayed's business/family empire would make the tragedy possible. It also offers a remarkably sensitive view of Rees-Jones's recovery. I found myself really liking him and his family, and however much 'unforgettable' may be an overused descriptor, it is certainly applicable in this case."
4,Very interesting read,"This was a good book and I'm glad that I purchased it to read. There were a couple of things that I didn't really understand but it was probably just me. For instance, if Trevor didn't recall anything for 3 minutes prior to the wreck, how was it described in such detail of how the wreck seemed to happend...from clipping the white car to hitting the pillar. I do think that Fayed seemed to be difficult towards the bodyguards in the aftermath of the accident. However, I also think that he has such grief and just wants an explanation as to why his son is dead. What Trevor Reese-Jones went through though is amazing that he has come back to a life as well as he has. He is a very strong individual who had an amazing family to be there for him and stand with him during his ordeal. He has nothing to be ashamed of from what I read in regards to his duties being fullfilled."
3,"Good human story, and that's all","If anyone could illuminate the precise details of the crash that killed Henri Paul, Emad Fayed and Diana Spencer then it is the author of this book. As would be expected in such an impact however, Rhys Jones remembers nothing of the last few minutesHis recollections of the extraordinary lifestyle of his charge and entourage are fascinating but hardly revelatory. Supporting evidence suggests that the bodyguard is correct in his general description of the attitudes, relationships and perspectives of Emad and his dominating fatherThe solution to the crash - if it is ever found - will probably rest on physical evidence and objective analysis. Rhys Jones naturally provides nothing of that. But as a memoir of a calm, dedicated man doing an almost impossible job the book is certainly worth reading"
4,"Good book, fits known facts, doesn't disprove conspiracy","Pretty good book, wish Mr. Rees-Jones hadn't ghostwritten it. The facts to the story as presented fit so well with established history that it's got to be right. Some say it disproves conspiracies, I disagree,Mr. Rees-Jones doesn't remember all details or even that Henri Paul was drunk. While it may very well have been an accident drunkeness might have affected others actions towards the Mercedes. An attempted scare or attack could still have happened as some claim."
2,Enough Already,"Being the anglophile that I am,I had to get this book and read yet another point of view on the Dodi /Diana romance.After I finished, I realized that this was not the book to find intimate details. Trevor Rees-Jones is to be commended on his ability to undergo such scrutiny and carry on his life after such a tragedy. But, could not help but think that he was trying to make a few pounds off of it as well."
1,We must assume that he is one of MI6's paid stooges,"After reading Trevor's book, I just felt pity for him. That's because his lying version of the events is so pathetic.For example, he said the carbon monoxide found in Henri Paul's blood came from the car's airbags. This is not true. The airbags contain no carbon monoxide or any other poisonous gases.The facts are now so overwhelming it is difficult to believe how anyone can swallow the line that is being put out by the French and British authorities. But for some people, it is easier to buy the Big Lie, rather than deal with the obvious implications of high-level French and British involvement."
1,Basically a waste of time..................,"For those that were truly fans of Diana, this book does nothing. I am not, but still can respect a well written story which this book is definitely not. All it does do, is give some slight info to the curious of what took place a few months prior to her death. As far as any real insight into her life, personality, accident and all the miscellanoeus issues surrounding it, this book just touches the surface. Nothing gained or lost here except a little bit of time in the reading."
2,No as expected,This got such great reviews. I just couldn't get myself to take this everday didn't like the taste.
5,a famous basketball player in this film,what a great movie the young man (can't think of his name right now) that played cornbread his movie appearance was fantistic and this also was a tragic movie it was so real and the point made about race relations was by far outstanding even though this was not a true stoy fantastic actors and actresses
4,Good Buy for the Money,"I was really wanting Cooley High, but I vaguely remembered Cornbread, Earl and Me, so I snagged this set. Normally movies packaged together in sets spells cheap, but the transfer on these two films is about as good as you could expect unless Criterion decided to give them the treatment. Each film has its own disc. Both films still hold up remarkably well, Cooley High especially. The one reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is that the set is woefully absent of extras, meaning there are none at all. Many of these actors are still alive, not sure about the director or producer, but since they are both different the the normal blaxploitation films coming out at the time, it would have been interesting to hear about what it took to get these two particular films made. Still a good buy, you won't be disappointed."
4,Love This Classic,Loved this movie as a child so glad i was able to find both movies in one package. Came one time
2,Buy 2 movies only 1 work.,"Bought the combo Cornbread, Earl & Me/ Cooley High. My Cooley High movie does not work at all. Tried it in different dvd players. That was the reason why I purchased that combo just for Cooley High."
1,Only one of the movies in set!!!,"Unfortunately, I purchased this earlier this year but did not open it until a couple of days ago! To my surprise and displeasure, the disc labeled ""Cornbread, Earl and Me"" is a recorded program for children (Thomas The Train) I am a movie collector in the process of upgrading old movies from vhs to dvd. Often, I don't actually watch the movies right away. That being said, I have had very good experiences with my purchases, and this is the first time this has happened!"
5,happy,I am very happy with my purchase. Amazon delivers all the movies I have search for months. I purchase used and they play just as well as new.
3,Ok but not fantastic...,"I am not sure if this item is authentic. I know that Prada definitely sells this style but the price was too good to be true. Nonetheless, the bag is very cute. So overall, I am happy with it."
4,Not sure how to Rate this,"The photos looks great - no, GREAT, but they're tacky/sticky. I've been reading widely on the web and I'm not sure if that's a fuction of the printer that I'm using or the paper.I use a CHEAP HP Deskjet 3940 with this paper so I really shouldn't complain.I read somewhere that if HP uses different ink technology then the photos would be waterproof and would dry faster.So all that to say that the paper is heavy and feels good in the hand. The appearance of the photos even from an ""inferior"" printer are FANTASTIC. But the sticky, slow-to-dry photos? I don't know if that's really the paper's fault!"
4,Not what I expected,"The photo paper is pretty good quality and my photos look great, The only thing I didn't like is that it has a little strip you have to tear off on each photo. I don't remember seeing anything about this in the product description or review-maybe I just overlooked it, but beware!! I personally do not like the strip, sometimes it doesn't tear off clean so you have a ragged edge on your photo. I've used HP photo paper in the past that did not have this and was completely happy, this particular kind not as much."
4,The sizing is a bit weird,"I love pictures, and printing them all the time, I bought this paper for a project I had, and while it prints pictures fine, the size is kinda weird. No Matter how you size your photo there's always a weird white space that's not filled (other than the tear off part) but overall I'm happy"
1,Photo Paper Review,"Four of the six packets (100 sheets) of 4"" X 6"" HP Photo paper contained paper that was longer than six inches, by about a half inch. Very useless for my purpose, since to use the paper I will need to have each of the four odd packets trimmed so that the sheets can be fed then from either direction."
2,"Dull, lifeless colors","Compared to Canon Photo Paper Plus Glossy II this paper produced dull, lifeless images on my HP OfficeJet Pro 8000. Not recommended."
3,Put Barbie back together again and again!,"This puzzle was a Christmas Present. I bought it to go with the Barbie doll. My niece loves to put puzzles together, and I thought it was unique that there was a jizsaw puzzle to go with the accessories for Barbie.She really enjoyed it.Thanks."
5,Primer on American Labor Law,An excellent book that is easy to read for law students and lay people alike. I have put a copy in my union library. Unanimous kudos from everyone who has consulted it. Gould is a fine writer and the book makes a lot of murky topics much more accessible.
3,A primer on American Labor Law Fourth Addition,The book review does not matter as it was required for class. I am very unhappy with the service from Amazon. It was more than a week before I received the book although I paid for express delivery. I see you did not hesitate to charge me for this. I will probably not order from you again.
2,Not a good movie starring Donnie Yen,"The costumes reveals this movie's shoestring budget. The fighing scenes are below par compared with other good films starring Donnie. The acting and the plot are not intersting either. This is more like a bad TV show than a movie. Donnie's famous for his kung fu skills. You should see Iron Monkey, Hero and Blade 2 to appreciate how good he is.It's still worth renting to satisfy your curiosity."
2,=(,"Kung fu master was a favorite of mine in the martial arts genre due to its solid story and the main character being portrayed by Donnie Yen (Great actor). However, Revenge of the Kung fu master (the second half of Kung Fu Master) is an utter mess. The pacing of the story is absolutely out of control, important key events are not delved into far enough, such as the survival of certain key characters, and a lot of areas made honestly no sense whatsoever.I have a strong feeling that a lot of the scenes were cut since the story didn't exactly flow very smoothly at all. It's like getting from one side of a canyon to the other without having to deal with the gapping hole that stands inbetween.Honestly, I would only recommend this dvd package for those who want a conclusion (note: not a very good one) to Kung Fu Master."
4,Yoga for your Eyes,"...Yoga for your Eyes has been very helpful but it takes time and perseverance to follow through. We wish the print in the attached booklet would have been bigger, this is after all, for people with bad eyesight."
4,yoga for eyes and minds,"This is a very good set of book and dvd with easy to follow instructions. You learn a lot about eyes, body and mind cooperation. It makes you to respect the best organs of your senses.THE EYES!"
4,Useful for presenting different opinions,"I got this book for my 10 year old nephew. I read it all before giving it to him. He really didn't seem very interested just yet, but I think he will go back to this in a year or so. When I gave it to him, we talked about how this book gave a lot of facts about boys' bodies, but it also gave a lot of opinions about moral issues and things like that. I explained that I agree with some of the opinions, but disagree with others. I think this book is good for teaching kids that people have many different viewpoints on this topic and ultimately they will have to choose their own and it's ok if it's different than mine."
3,boys,My boys read this book together and talked about all their weird things they are going through. It opened up conversation. Don't agree with sex before marriage. So we discussed it and the problems with it.
4,i like it,"and do know why? because phil anselmo did what every musician would love to do, but is soo afraid of doing because of what everyone else would think. phil anslemo made an album that he wanted to make. he didn't care about what anyone would think, and he probably didn't care if the album sold at all. he just did what he wanted to. and he made a pretty cool album in the process.if it was a joke, i didn't get it. i didn't think that it was a funny album."
3,VIKING CROWN BROKEN DOWN,Why all the bad reviews? This album sounds pretty cool. I wasn't expecting to hear pantera. It's pretty abient and spacey. I like it better than superjoint.Not saying I would buy it(might burn it)...but...not bad- or worse than other bands trying to do similar things.;)
3,"Good guy, now bad guy","Did Batista become a bad guy so the title of this DVD in more in line with the character he plays now?One week he's fighting Randy Orton who is a ""bad guy"" and a couple of weeks later he beat up Mysterio who is a good guy.The DVD is drawn out and predictable, not like his career."
2,When Will WWE Stop Making PPV Already On DVDs On Compilations,The 2nd Star Is Only Becuz Batista Is My #4 Wrestler On My List And Cant Go Wrong With Having A Documentry On The Set. But This Is Getting Ridiculous All These Matches Any WWE DVD Collector Already Has. And Batista Had Some Of His Best Matches On Smackdown And Raw And Even ECW. Maybe It's Time To Make WWE Dvds With 2 Alternate Sets One With TV Show Matches And One With PPV Matches For Those Who Don't Own The PPV DVDs Already. It's Just Another DVD Set That Could Have Been 10 Times Better But Now Will Have To Settle For Half Decent.
2,I am confused,"This set confuses me. Why is Batista getting a three disc DVD? The documentary has a slim chance of being interesting, but even with that being the case, a his matches are NOT THAT GREAT. All of the matches except for 3 are on previous DVD's. The time wasted on this DVD set could have been given to someone else. This set is not a good idea."
2,Boring and pointless,"I have seen various Fassbinder movies and this one is clearly the weakest. Somebody tell me the point of this movie.Pioneers in Ingolstadt is about a group of Germany army recruits stationed in the small Bavarian town of Ingolstadt to build a wooden bridge. The movie summarizes the interactions of various recruits with the local population from sexual encounters with the women and evoking jealousy amongst local men. Then, the bridge is built and they leave at the end.As said, I watched this movie and at the end, asked myself what it was about. Some of the material doesn't make sense either. The soldiers wear swastikas on their berets. [...] Also, there is a BMW in the movie which appears to have been manufactured well after World War II.If you want to see some of Fassbinder's better works, watch movies like Martha and Katzelmacher. This one will disappoint."
5,Great Product,"I bought this wireless keyboard for use with a laptop, and later a Mac Mini being used as a multimedia center. I wanted a sturdy, easy to use, easy to navigate device that would allow me to control Hulu, NetFlix, multimedia files, music, etc. from a distance. Something that would be the right size and practical from the couch. I was so happy when I received it because that's exactly what I got. It's well built, the trackball is extremely easy to use, and it's just the perfect size. I'm not sure this is something I'd use for normal computer use requiring an extensive amount of typing, but basically as a multimedia remote, it's just perfect. The keyboard is comparable to most laptop keyboards. I'm recommending it to everyone I know for similar setups. Also, I was blown away when I tried it on my Mac and it worked perfectly - even the shortcut keys!"
4,Annoying mouse,"All in all a great wireless keyboard, but the mouse is not always responsive. It is a pretty loud mouse to maneuvre. Bought this for my husband, but while he is using it, he still wishes it was better."
2,Worked fairly well for a while...,"I have had this keyboard for several months and it seems the performance has degraded. It is always dropping letters as I type, causing maybe 5% of what I type not to show on the screen. The bigger complaint is the mouse. It is difficult to get it aimed at a specific spot on the screen, and the cursor will wander on its own, sometimes jiggling as the signal from the keyboard is continuually sent to the dongle. You can see this happening by the light on the dongle being almost solidy lit. I recommendd this to a friend and he is having better results, but has used it very little."
3,BATTERY EATER,I really like this keybard but the thing eats up batteries fast. Not only that but the keyboard/trackball is so sensitive that even the slightest movenent causes my Windows 7 Median PC to wake from sleep mode. The manufacturer should have included an on/off switch. This would have solved the two issues above.
1,"Same as Adesso, stay away!","I have owned at least 5 Adesso WKB-3000UB keyboards. This is the same keyboard under a different name. Look it up. I would buy this keyboard in a flash if I thought it had higher quality, but I doubt it. I love the ergonomics of the Adesso/DSI, it can't be beat, which is why I keep buying them. But alas I have to move on. Tired of wasting money on great ergonomics and poor quality. Take a look at the Adesso. It's the same keyboard. Nobody is more disappointed than I. I absolutely love the layout of this keyboard. If Adesso/DSI would invest in higher quality components/design I would gladly pay 10, 20, 30 dollars or more for the ergonomics of this keyboard combined with reliability. I'm tempted to try the DSI but my gut says it is an Adesso in sheep's clothing. Don't waste your money. 0 for 5. :(Prove to me this is better/different than the Adesso. I would buy it in a flash."
2,What a Mess,Recieved package upon reciving insirted into computer and keyboard work not work. I was using the supplied batteries that didnt even match. So i thought they might be bad bought new batteries. Still nothing what a joke this product is.
1,don't bother with this keyboard,"I've owned my keyboard for a couple months. The reason I bought this keyboard is because there are few keyboards out ther with a trackball and keyboard integrated into one nice package. The ergonomics are nice and the trackball is responsive, but the keyboard is junk. Within three weeks of buying this keyboard, the number and function keys failed (and still don't work) and the letters seem to vary on which one's will work. One night the ""c"" and ""v"" won't work and the next night the ""b"",""n"" and ""d"" don't work. There are no fixes for this and DSI seems to be unavailable when I call."
2,Very frustrating,"I threw this thing away after i just couldn't take having to retype and retype over and over when im typing away and only partial words would get typed out because the wireless signal wouldn't keep up with my typing, and i'm no speed typer either."
4,Great with my Mac Mini,"It's not the most solid keyboard, but I'm using it to control my Mac media machine so typing is minimal. The built in trackball mouse is adequate. Overall works great."
2,What a great keyboard (NOT)!,"I bought this keyboard to control Windows Media Center primarily. I have a large projection theater setup that places me about 30ft from the computer and despite being on the edge of its range, it worked great - for about a year. Out of the blue the other day the mouse no longer worked and only SOME of the keys (it's like the FN key was stuck on). I've read where others have had this exact problem. It's almost like, after time, something inside burns out and you're left with a crippled keyboard and NO mouse. I've since recieved a different brand kayboard, but it has issues as well. Why can't someone simply make an RF keyboard that works?Anyway - BEWARE, there are other keyboards with different brand names that are actually this same keyboard - so watch for this design and avoid it."
1,Very Disappointed,"It broke within 2 hours of use. The S key got stuck, disabling all the other keys and the mouse. The only way I could get it to stop typing S was to unplug the receiver from the USB. Also had trouble with it missing key strokes while it was working. Plan to return for a refund."
1,Disappointed,The keyboard is miserable. It sometimes doesn't type a letter and at other times it will type multiple letters unexpectedly. I am going back to my Logitech keyboard.
2,Does Not Fit,"I am giving these mats a 2 rating for the quality of material. Otherwise, I would give it a 1. The material used was good quality, and the nibs grabbed well. But the mats are not custom fit. Matter of fact it looks like someone tried to cut them with a razor knife (the edges are not straight, and some corners are jagged). The driver's mat is too small and not cut in the right shape. the passenger mat is too large. It is cut in the correct shape but not at the correct angles. The two rear mats are too large. I could have gone to a home improvement store and purchased the mat material myself and cut them using the carpeted mats as a template. May still have to do that for the Driver's mat. The other three can be trimmed."
3,Good but flawed,"I heard about this book on Dave Emory's radio show, and I myself like Savitri Devi's work. However book is written by a religious right eglartarian, and it's not an adjective biography on Devi herself. In fact I resent the fact that most of Devi's work is Hitler fetish pieces. To me it reads like Hindu nationalism, and only the politically correct view as racist. As far as Nazism affiliation with the occult, however the occult had no influence on Hitler's regin in Nazi Germany, the big banks did."
5,A Very Informative You Are Sure to Enjoy,"This is a lovingly written biography about a famous film star from the 1940s and early 1950s. The book goes into detail about all of Grable's films and successes as well as touching on her family life. I found out many things from this book. For one, I had no idea Betty Grable was such a popular actress. For all I knew, she appeared on ""I Love Lucy"" and did two or three movies. I was certainly wrong! It also includes passing comments on a bevy of other stars, especially Marilyn Monroe and Alice Faye. This is a must buy for you if you enjoy Betty Grable, her films, or the culture of the 1940s and 1950s!"
5,I am not objective...,"about Betty Grable.I loved all her movies as a kid. This book is really a valentine to her, and for my money, she deserves all the nice things ever said about her! If you are a Grable fan, you will love this book...wonderful pictures! You will also be outraged at theway 20th treated its ""golden blonde"" later in her career.But ""Girl with the Million Dollar Legs"" is a terrific Betty bio."
4,Betty Grable The million dollar legs,"this book is a lovingly written fan letterto many refrences to friends , betty,s box office position is unasailable . interviews with real friends and colleagues who could still be alive have been sauced. people like bob wagner,june haver ,marge champion, debbie reynolds , daughter carrie fisher. debbie herself ,sheree north,grable,s own daughters , fayes daughters,mitzi gaynor the list goes ongood"
5,"believable, well-written, and easy-to-read","This is the most complete Betty Grable biography that I have read. It is fun to read, well-documented, and free of unfounded rumors and distortions that mar some Hollywood biographies."
2,Lack of Depth and Boring,"I am graduate history student researching WWII-era pin-ups... I picked up this book, and was extremely disappointed. McGee writes not from the perpective of an objective observer, but as a man overcome with infatuation for Grable. He has nothing put praise for her, ignoring her more negative attributes. The book is shallow and superficial. He doesn't bother to analyze the effects Grable had on WWII or 1950's culture. He doesn't place in her much of a social/cultural context. He has little to say about gender and sexuality at this time in history. Rather, he rambles on about the most mundane of incidents. The book is very much a story of her personal life. I suppose this is what he was going for: a straight biography. Still, it is disorganized and lacking in depth. His writing lacks excitement and precision. I'm glad some folks out there enjoyed it, but I found it burdensome."
5,Great Cover For Honda EU3000is!,"I bought this cover for my Honda EU3000is generator. The dimensions are slightly different, but close enough that I thought I'd take a chance. This cover fits like it was made for the Honda. As other reviewers have said, the cover material is surprisingly heavy considering the price. The quality of the workmanship seems good and the pocket for accessory storage is great. I'd also like to have elastic or a draw string at the bottom, but it fits snugly enough that it's not an absolute necessity. I'd recommend this without hesitation!"
5,great cover,"fits perfect, has storage pocket keeps out rain and weather just a needed addition for the generator"
5,You Ignorant Ba*terds,"This flag does NOT represent SLAVERY, but rather the idea of acting in the best interests of the people it represents. Unless you actually historically study the civil war, slavery had squat to do with it, it was about what two types of people wanted, and those in the south felt like they were being exploited by the big-shot ""corporations"" and all the northen lawmakers and they had enough. This flag represents their bravery for standing up for what they genuinely believe in. Abe Lincoln didn't free the slaves because he thought it was right, he wanted more bodies to fight and needed to show people he could stand for something solid.I am against slavery, but I love this flag and for what it TRULY stands for."
1,poorly made cheep flag,This is an extremely low quality flag. Its only one sided (one side appears faded). The red is ugly. Its more of a salmon color instead of red. I was disappointed when I opened this flag up. To fly this low quality flag would be a shame to the south. I doubt the flag would hold up long in the wind. I will be returning this item.
3,missing info. prior to purchase.,"I like the book, but wish it included some information prior to purchase that it's best to buy the ""work book"" to go along with it!"
5,Love it!,"I spend about a a half hour with this book every day - or a couple hours every other day. It's great for building confidence and practice.Ever feel that books like ""Drawing on the right side of the brain"" were somehow sterile and lifeless? This book is chock full of a million creative drawings that can be done with a little patience."
4,Drawing in 3-D,"Very neat book, but not what exactly I was looking for. I wanted more objects or animals and this book does show letters of the alphabet in 3-D and cartoon characters. Little disappointed however the book itself was in great shape."
2,Tell It All,"This is an important subject but the author does not do the hard work of putting all of the information together in a coherent form. The chapters ramble from topic to topic and the book contains anecdotal stories that do not support the main points well. Also, the author uses analogies that are meant to be witty but instead detract from the point. The author is very knowledgeable and does a good job of explaining open source software (2 stars), but in my opinion fails to explain the book's subtitle. There's little real info about how Linux & open source are undercutting Microsoft, Sun etc. That analysis should be the author's next book."
2,"Works, but not great","I have a desk that I work at in my basement. I bought this to keep me warm through the winter. Within 2 weeks, I had scheduled its return and was looking for something else.The construction of this thing is pretty solid. My main problem with it was that it only warmed the air within a foot or two of the heater. Any further away didn't get any heat. If you're trying to heat a very small room, this might work for you, but you'll be paying a good sized electric bill. I had my legs right next to it and they weren't feeling any heat.As I mentioned, I was just trying to keep myself warm, not the entire space. As a result, I ended up with this,Optimus H-5210 Infrared Quartz Radiant Heater, for a much lower price. I would definitely recommend this heater instead."
3,There are better ones out there,I am not too thrill with this baseboard heater. It does not warm the way it is advertise. I have a small space of 400 sq ft in basement and it takes a while to get the room warm. There are better ones out in the market.
5,The Book Was Great!,"I just finished the book today around Noon. It was very good. It kept me wanting more. I felt as though you were beating around the bush on some topics....but it's all good. Are you gonna write more books? Put me on the list for one. The book touched my heart because I could relate to a lot of topics like.........being molested, having dreams and goals (that people did not agree with), Daydreaming, struggling, feeling different from other people. And overcoming it ALL. Keep your eyes on the prize and keep moving forward.I am glad that I had the opportunity to meet the author and get a signed copy.CEO of Beaded Jewlery by Sonya~"
5,genuine part fit fine,"an exact replacement for both the pump and prescreen that came inside my 1989 Mazda 323. I was replacing the original gas tank last fall after a puncture and decided to change out the in tank pump at the same time, since it was original, too. Good thing I did! as i was handling the old pump to dispose of it the plastic nipple on it crumbled--just a matter of time before it would have failed in tank (but 23 years of service wasn't bad ;-) New pump looked just like old and has been fine for over 4 months, so no reason it won't last another 20."
1,"Great idea, poor performance","I bought the Avenger 21361 Dual Line Laser Guide Kit for my Dewalt 705 compound miter saw. The product comes in two parts: an inner laser and an outer laser. 1st problem: the outer laser is too big for the arbor fitting -- and not just a little bit, it's at least 1/8"" top and bottom and 1/4"" side to side. 2nd problem: I decided to install only the inside laser. 20 minutes of use and it no longer puts a guide line on the work piece. I changed the batteries -- still no satisfaction. I wish it had worked, it would have made all of those cuts a LOT easier."
4,A little sloppy,"This is a nice unit and I do not know if there different tolerances on dewalt arbors are to be considered. The supplied bushings were to sloppy to center the blade on the arbor,this would result in the blade not runing true.I made a new bushing. The laser beams are exactly on target,almost cant make a mistake.I did bring this to the attention of Avenger but did not get a positive reply. Perhaps having been a machinist I am a bit fussy.I am not knocking this product, it is not a factory installed product and is reasonably priced."
5,good product,good product and i learned u can use this with the 31 how awesome is that just to let u guys know if u was wondering well u can on a rustler
4,Campnet,"This is a good headset. Sound quality at both ends of the call is very good. The in-line answer works fine with my Galaxy S3. The ear clip is a little tricky to get on at first, but with practice, is easier - holds in place well a about an 8 out of 10 in comfort. Should come in a 3.5MM version, or include an adapter."
3,Sound's a bit low,"It's comfortable, can sit in your ear for a long time without any pain. But even with the volume on loudest, it takes an effort to hear what the caller is saying. And you have to speak really loud too."
1,NO ME SIRVIERON,"DEFINITIVAMENTE No SIRVE ESTE PRODUCTO, ADEMAS DE QUE SOLICITE CUATRO Y POR CADA UNA DE ESTAS DIMINUTAS DIADEMAS, ME COBRARO EN ENVIO, ES TODO UN ROBO"
1,Didn't fit,"Didn't notice the 2.5mm size... didn't fit so its just sitting somewhere, lost in my room.I know I'm to blame, but I'm still totally disappointed.Make sure 2.5mm is the size you want!"
3,Good for money,"This was 5 bucks for me and i got what i paid for. It works fine but you have to hold in the button to mute its not toggle. Also it has a slight buzz constantly but its not very noticeable, and no volume control. Other than that its comfortable and makes for a good back up when my wireless goes dead."
5,The ONLY headset that stays put,"I have a stack of headsets for my cell phone and house phone that I cannot use. This Plantronics is the only one that stays in place, has good volume, can be put in my ear with one hand while I'm driving. When I'm not talking, I can take the plug out of my ear and it hangs neatly from the clip I use on my collar or shirt. The only problem is they are not making them with a 3.5mm plug and that's where the new phones are going so i need the adapter. I still love it. I have one in my car, one in my house and a spare."
1,DID not work,"This did not work. Buyer Beware. Mic worked, but not the earphone. Is odd to wear as well."
4,You get what you pay for,"The product was delivered in a timely fashion. I use this product to provide customer service from home. Sometimes my customers can't hear me and vice versa. On most calls they hear me, but this is what I get for paying less than $5.00 for a headset, when I should have invested in one that was at least $50."
4,Comfortable - Good Sound Quality,"This is very comfortable. I use it primarily in the car. It's fine for a long drive. Sound quality is very good. If you don't have a bluetooth phone, the cord is a necessary evil. The value was excellent. Same item at that great big discount store was 3x the price."
3,"They sound so near, but I sound so far...","For the price, you couldn't ask for anything more. It works for both my cell and home phone, but the microphone could of been better. I can hear the other end crisp and clear but they are having a hard time hearing me. The problem seems to lie in the mic boom; if the boom was just a tad longer, then the other end wouldn't have problems hearing me. They couldn't hear me closely (and clearly) unless I pull the mic closer to the edge of my mouth. So bottom line, I can hear them fine and they can hear me, but....I sounded far away from them (in reality I am otherwise we wouldn't be having a phone conversation), but you know what I mean.Pros:Audio is clearComes with USB adapter (Motorola type input).Works with both cell and home phones.Bargain deal (I got 4 for under 6 bucks shipped)Cons:Mic boom is a bit shortOther end has a hard time hearing until you pull the mic closer to speak."
1,Cheap Headset,"Pros: Loud and clear, great price.Cons: Nobody can hear you, if you can get it in your ear. You get what you pay for."
3,Works well,"Pros - People can clearly hear what I speak on the other side of the phone, when using this headset.Cons - Audio reception is not as clear as talking on the handset. No volume control. Sometimes it is hard to make it hold on the ear."
3,Works Fine...,Just tried it out and it seems to work fine but it's kind of uncomfortable. It did not come in the manufacturer packaging and did not have any instructions so I'm not sure if I have it positioned right.
4,Overall the Plantronics MX150 is a very good wired headset,"This is a very good wired headset. And for the price, it's a great value.Clear sound both for the user and the person on the other end of the call. Most people state they don't know I'm calling from my car, so it shields road noise pretty well.The only drawback for me is that the rubber ""U"" that curves over my earlobe is a little uncomfortable after wearing it for 15 minutes or more. This is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars.Overall I'm very happy with the Plantronics MX150 wired headset and would definitely buy it again. Enjoy!"
1,Do not buy,"After reading many reviews about headsets, I settled on this one. What a mistake! It never worked. No one could hear me while I was talking on this headset, and I could only faintly make out the voice of anyone talking to me. A waste of money!"
1,Did not work very well. Do not bother,"The price was appealing for what I needed. Unfortunately it did not work well because it would cut out on my cell phone if the plug moved at little bit. I tried it on a home desk phone with a headset plug and it happened there as well. This was too annoying so I had to toss it into the garbage. It was too much work and money to send it back. However, I understood this when I purchased it. I do not recommend this productPlantronics MX150 Flexible Boom Headset with 2.5 mm Plugfrom this seller."
1,Too old to work,The volume coming through the earpiece is practically non-existent. These seem to be old discontinued headsets that are not worth even the $2 or so money I spent for them.
1,DID NOT WORK,IN THE PAST THIS HEADSET HAS WORKED GREAT.THIS HEADSET NEVER WORKED & BEING UNEMPLOYED AT THIS TIME I CANNOT AFFORD THE POSTAGE TO RETURN IT. VERY FRUSTRATING.THANK YOU B. RUOTOLO
3,Decent headset for gaming (Xbox),"This is the headset I use for my Xbox 360. I usually buy them 2 at a time. I don't think I've gotten one to last longer than 5 months. However, I have a 4 year old that climbs my entertainment center and gets into them. He thinks they're fun to chew on. (Grr!) With that said, it's hard to determine how long they'll last when he's not getting into them. They're definitely worth the price though, for sure. Plantronics is a great brand."
2,"Comfortable and lightweight, but intolerably hissy","I received the headset in a plain plastic bag with no paperwork. The headset bears a ""Verizon wireless"" logo.I loved the light weight and easy fit in the ear, but unfortunately the headset has a pronounced hiss,especially noticeable when there is no conversation going on (e.g., when dialing, waiting on voice mail,and so on). The hiss is so bad that although I love the fit and the light weight, I won't use it."
2,Hard on the head,"Not sure why, but I get headaches when using this headset. Since I get headaches when using a cell phone in general, I purchase headsets to distance the phone somewhat. Usually it works. Not with this headset however. Not sure why."
3,Good,"VERY comfortable to wear, but I have had complaints that the cound is ""broken up"". I can hear the other person well, but they can not necessarily hear me well. Disappointed."
4,A good deal on a good headset.,I am using this headset with an older cell phone and am very pleased with it.
1,"Worked ok for about 3 months, then broke out of the blue","When I first received this earpiece I was satisfied with it, although I must say the way the earpiece attaches to your ear is not only awkward, but uncomfortable as well. You do get used to it, but I don't see why they could not make this like every other earphone that goes over the back of your ear instead of clipping onto your ear lobe.Mostly, I'm dissatisfied with this product because out of the blue one day while I was on the phone the earpiece just STOPPED WORKING! I have tried another headset and my phone is ok. So given that, I will not trust this company to produce quality products again. I don't normally give anything 1 star, but how can I not for a product that broke so quickly?"
1,Not worth $1.00,You get what you pay for. Paid $1.00 plus shipping. Wast of money. Does not work correctly with iPhone.
2,unimpressed,"I was double-shipped when I ordered this, and now have 2. Neither of them work well, the cord becomes disconnected if it is moved even the slightest little bit where it connects to the phone. I am petite woman and it falls off of my ear. I think the mute button is too far down the cord. And I think I also got generic product like another reviewer says. My item(s) doesn't (don't) say Plantronics, it says Verizon."
2,Doesn't Feel Right,"I received this item without the rubber tip to cushion your ear. So it was raw plastic against my ear. It may be great for those who wear glasses, but it takes a while to put it on if you're trying to answer a call and have a caller to hold on while you try to fit the clip on your earlobe. Once there it feels as tho it's going to slip off. It just doesn't feel as secure as if it were wrapped around your ear. I have now set it aside and ordered something else."
5,Comfortable and great quality!,"Ingenious design for anyone who wears glasses. Bought the MX150 for my Samsung Rant. Good sound from ear-bud and excellent sound from the boom mic, even better than the mic in the phone IMHO. Has mute button on the cord and no other controls. I can easily and quickly place the unit securely in my ear with one hand- which is very difficult with the over-ear type headset and impossible if you're wearing glasses."
2,Not the same,"After about a month I placed the order, I never received the product. After contacting the seller, they promply sent out another one but when I received the package, it was not the same brand of head phone as advertised. Instead, I received a Verizon headset and the ear wrap around had a slight tear in it. But all in all, it works with my Xbox 360 and for only a little over $2.00 I guess you can't ask for too much."
2,Not that comfortable,"This mini headset seems to work well, but it's not the most comfortable. To secure it to your head, it utilizes an ""under the ear"" flexible clamp. It's difficult to put on comfortably and difficult to keep comfortable while you're using it. The foam ear piece cover also tore and was destroyed after a few days of use. Nice low price, but I'll be looking for another product to provide a better solution."
1,Only works with certain phones,"This headset is fine when using an adapter for a different phone. The company was kind enough to send another when I told them it did not work on my Verizon phone.But the replacement would not work either,Plantronics MX150 Flexible Boom Headset with 2.5 mm Plugunless the adapter was use on another type of phone. Either way, I am without a working headset for my phone. I would recommend the company who was prompt to send out another at no cost."
2,"If sound quality matters, skip this product","I've tried every kind of earpiece for my Samsung phone, and so far, have not found one that has the sound quality I'm looking for. The Plantronics was another disappointment. I ordered it because of the numerous recommendations on this site, but the sound quality was inadequate. It is comfortable, lightweight, and the microphone does a good job of picking up the user's voice, but the person on the other end sounds like they are speaking through a pillow. I know it wasn't a defective unit, because I ordered three (two for backup), and tried them all. As a side note, the earpiece that came with the phone, the earbud type (similar to ipod headphones), has excellent (stereo) sound quality, a great microphone, and is very comfortable. The only issue I have with that setup is that there are two, long wires that dangle from my ears, and that the microphone is on the cord and not a boom, which gets caught on my shirt or jacket collar. I'm sticking to it anyway."
2,Not loud enough,3-4 different parties told me they had a difficult time hearing me and that I needed to speak up even with their volume turned completely up.
2,"You need to speak very, very loud","It's not comfortable as I imagined it would be, and while doing a conference calls using a home headset, everyone tells me that they barely hear me, so I disconnect it.I have not purchased anything from Plantronics, but I imagined some kind of logo, or name on the product, which I could not find, because of that I think this must be a nont-Plantronics product, thus it does not work the way it should.ProsWill stay in your ear for a very long time, without discomfort.Incoming sound is good.ConsYou have to be a loud mouth in order for others to hear you.Not easy to install over the ear"
3,you get what you pay for,The earpiece does not fit well. While i can hear people it does not hold in place well and i find that i need to hold it which makes my conversations short. i would opt to spend more $$ on a better earpiece but for the price... you get what you pay for.
1,Won't fit. Useless.,"This item is useless. The plug is far too small to fit my phone, despite the description that this will fit ""LG phones"". I own the DARE and this doesn't fit. The DARE uses the standard jack while this thing is the 2.5 mm whatever. Who uses such a tiny plug? I've NEVER seen that size on any cell phone! You get what you pay for. This item is a joke."
2,Wrong plug,"Unfortunately, the plug on this headset has a collar on it that prevents usage on certain phones. After purchasing for roughly $10 and paying over $5 to ship, I now have a $16 piece of something I cannot use. Doesn't make any sense to pay to ship it back. MAKE SURE YOU KNOW IT FITS BEFORE ORDERING. THEY ARE NOT ALL THE SAME."
2,Doesn't fit my Iphone!,My best friend uses this phone device and recommended it. I ordered just 2 to see if it worked on my Iphone but it does not- so I can't rate it!I was really looking forward to having this prduct- any recommendations out there for an Iphone?Thanks
1,RIP OFF!! FORCED TO WRITE GOOD REVIEW!! NEVER RECEIVED!!,I never recieved my 2 headsets & I contacted the company. The lady I spoke with told me in order for me to receive my headsets I would have to give them 5 stars & write a good review. I needed the headsets so I did so & I have still yet to see them.. I just recently filed a claim aganst them because I want a refund & I'll take my money somewhere else. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY WITH CITY CELLULAR! They rip you off & at the same time make you write them a good review.
1,Very Unhappy,This product was faulty. I couldn't hear anything at all. I contacted the correct parties and no one would contact me back. The customer service and quality were horrible. It was the biggest waste of money and time!
4,"Light, comfortable, STAYS ON MY HEAD.","This headset is comfortable, light, and fits well on my and my fiancee's smaller head. It doesn't pinch or cause discomfort even after several hours of use. As it's wired, you don't need to charge it, which is a plus."
3,Small Light Comfortable Use with iPhone 4,"Pro: The earpiece design fits well into the ear. Can also listen to music or movies with this earpiece. I have tried several ear pieces both wireless and wired. I travel a lot and want my wife to have a pleasant experience visiting with me on the phone. She states that this is the best ever that she has heard me. So we are moving in the right direction.Con: When I turn up the ear piece to hear the caller their voice feedback to them through the boom mic - this is a negative. When I turn down the volume, feedback no longer takes place but now I can't hear the caller.I will continue to read reviews and try other earpieces."
2,Didn't hold up to moderate use,Worked great for 2 months. Then it shorted - could no longer be heard on it. Moderate use - don't spend a lot of time on the phone.
3,Works but doesn't stay on well,"I bought this (along with a 2.5mm to 3.55 mm adapter) for my iPhone. I prefer a wired headset while I'm driving because in my experience the sound is clearer with no static and it's easier to use. This device works very well, but doesn't stay on my ear and the foam cover disintegrated within a week! That being said, I would still recommend it for sound, clarity and ease of use."
3,It could be better ... if,"For less than $5 it keeps me hands-free ... which is really helpful when I need to drive, keyboad or write while on the phone ... but it would be better if: 1). the volume/clarity were louder/clearer; 2). there was more than one clip to attach the dangling cord between phone and earpiece ... the dangling cord catches on everything when leaning over ... and when standiing upright again ... yank! ... off comes the earpiece :-("
1,Plantroonics MX150 Headset,"The headset gives clearer sound, according to people calling, but does not fit the ear very well. I would choose something else next time. This choice was made on price alone."
1,Awful. Threw it away.,"While I could hear the other person, at first they could not hear me at all and then after a lot of jiggling things, they could hear me but only through a lot of static and feedback. Absolutely awful and complete waste of money."
3,Not loud enough,This item arrived quickly. Friends hear me very well but the earpiece is not quite loud enough. Wish there was a way to turn it up.
2,Headset,The product is not OEM. The quality of sound is not good and if you are outside and the wind blows your conversation is over. You can not hear the caller very well at all. I had an OEM headset and it had great quality; tried to save some money. The product is only o.k.
3,seems to work fine..... But,"Once you figure out how to put this headset on where it doesn't slide off (I am still fighting with this after 3 months), the earpiece is adequate for hearing the conversation, and I have heard no complaints from people about how I sound on their end. Unfortunately, I usually have to end up holding the earpiece in my ear during some (if not all) of the time that I am using it, due to the fact that it won't stay in - very annoying."
4,Surprising for under three dollars!,"I recently ordered three corded headsets for my cell phone:Jabra Corded Mini-Boom Headset - Black (7253-29)Plantronics MX150 Flexible Boom Headset with 2.5 mm PlugJabra C250 EarWave Boom Headset for 2.5mm PlugsAll three together cost less than buying one headset at a store, especially once you factor in tax.The Plantronics is my favorite of the three. The way you wear it is a little odd (the earlobe clip), but once you're used to it, it's actually the best and easiest of the three. It's not hard to put on like some people have suggested, and I now do it one-handed while driving (pull the rubber piece down, insert speaker in ear, release).The sound is a *little* muddy compared to the other two, but the microphone seems to work quite well. Overall, everything is extremely acceptable.For under $3, buy 5 and call them disposable (leave one in each car, one at your desk, etc...)."
4,Can't beat the price.,"Great little headset and the price is unbeatable. Only complaint is that if the plug gets touched where it connects to the phone, it's easily disconnected so be careful about that."
5,Good product at a great price.,I was able to get two new headsets for under $10 and the sound quality is pretty good. What a great deal!
1,Broke!,"This broke after 2 days... and I'm a light user! Part of the back popped off while it was in my pocket, and although I can hear through it, nobody can hear me. Booooo! Cheap product! :("
1,A Piece Of Junk!,"I purchased this headset about two months ago. The first time I used it, it was very scratchy, both on my end and the person who I was calling. I only paid about $1.50 for it, so I didn't return it, it wasn't worth the hassle. Now I understand why the price was so discounted. I wouldn't recommend this headset to my worst enemy! You really do get what you pay for. If I could have rated this zero stars, I would have."
2,Don't waste your $$$,"Don't waste your $$$ on this one. I just received 2 of these things and I am very disappointed. It might say 'Plantronics' in the ad but there aren't any marking of the manufacturer. They were in a small zip log bag when I received them. The quality on how they are made is very poor to say the least. You get what you pay for. On the other hand, they do work. but for how long??"
2,Bought it! You got what you paid!,The title is a miss leading. It is not Plantronics MX150 Flexible Boom Headset with 2.5 mm Plug. I had one from verizon wireless before. MX150 had an answer button. This one does not have it. So it is not convenient. Do not recommend.
3,buyer,"Received the product but did not work, received the replacement still not work, sent back, got my refund, very friendly seller and helpful will definitely buy product from this seller again."
3,overall good deal,4 for 9.96$ and free shipping. good deal. some had a verizon logo which I can do without but otherwise a very good deal. they work on my home phone and cell.
3,Kind of hard to use...,"It took me about 10 minutes to figure out how this fit on my ear. After you get used to it it's not so bad, but if you aren't very good with your hands you might want to look for a more traditional headset..."
4,Nice Low Price,"You can not beat the low price, and it is about two second faster getting this on then the Jabra C510, that I also own, need two hands for the C510, but with the MX150 I can almost do it with one hand, and it kind of clips on the ear like a claps earring. I think it is alittle more comfortable and light weight compaired to the C510.Perforance wise, there is no problem with it I can hear and talk with clarity. The boom can swing roughly ' radians (180). It would always be nice if there was a 3.5 mm adaptor. There is one button to fiddle with on the cord, that I do not use, or know what it does."
4,"Nice headset for Xbox 360, but not without its flaws","I originally bought this headset for use with my Xbox 360. Turns out it works fairly nice. The earlobe attachment is very comfortable, and I can barely feel it after a little bit of use. The only reason that I'm giving it 4 stars is because to mute it, you have to hold down the button on the cord. You can't just press it. But other than that, for less than five bucks, this thing is awesome."
1,Don't purchase from this seller!!,I purchased 2 platronics headsets and neither of them worked!!! This company promised to replace them and then a week later I got an e-mail saying the order was cancelled because they were out of stock. I have yet to receive my refund!
2,Plantronics flexible headset with 2.5 mm,"I am not happy with the four I ordered from this seller...I have had the same one in the past and just loved it!The ear bud does not fit properly as well as the mic...this should just lay on your face and end at the corner of your mouth....well it does not! I am not happy ...Now I know why it was so inexpensive...I prefer using these with my cell phone or cordless home phone...however it just is not the same as the two I had in the past!I have gone back to using the headband headset altho bulky, it is great!"
1,FAKE stuff,"STAY AWAY, ITS FAKE. I don't believe it. This guy is selling a fake stuff and people are buying it like a candy, hundreds of them. I got a cheap plastic thing stuffed in plastic bag. No paper of any kind associated with it. No Plantronics written anywhere (even misspelled). Unbelievable to me that Amazon allows it to continue like this. Well looks like there are plenty of stupid people (or friends of seller) giving 5 star reviews."
2,Broke,"I give this headset an extra star for being fairly comfortable to wear. The volume is good too...if it's working.Like some other reviewers have mentioned, this headset's mic is prone to dying out of the blue, which is exactly what happened to mine. So you're having your usual conversation, and all of a sudden the other person can no longer hear you.I will be buying a replacement headset for my Plantronics phone, but definitely not another of this model. If you do buy this, it might be a good idea to have a replacement ready because it's a huge hassle to have to run off to Radio Shack when your headset dies in the middle of a business call!"
3,Pretty lousy headset,"I own 3 different headsets for my mobile phone. this by far is the worst and is now somewhere on the floor of my car forgotten but not missed. It is hard to clip it on the ear lobe, and the whole think feels quite flimsy, the mouth piece swings around on its own accord, and the sound quality not so good (i have a convertible and so they need to be quite good to overcome the wind sound maybe they'll work better elsewhere). I have 2 others that work well, of which one is the traditional blackberry headphones that come standard with new blackberry device. they don't look as good but they work better."
5,My wife likes it,"As the description indicates, the headset design is a bit different and takes a little getting used to. My wife likes it and we haven't had any problems with it (in 6 weeks)."
2,Bargains aren't always a bargain...,"I purchased two of these on for a backup. First the darn thing would not fit in my ear properly. When I did get it in good enough, I could not hear."
4,Better than the MX500,"Being a truck driver, I tested the MX150 and the MX500, which I bought at the same time. 2 out of 2 other truck driving buddies rated the MX150 better at sound quality on their end of the line. Less ""running water"" in the background sounds.I could hear equally as well on either set. I have learned however, that if the other person has to ""work"" at hearing you, they'll probably hang up. The MX500 works well at home with the cordless."
2,"Too much static, volume too low","I got this as a gift for my boyfriend (his phone didn't have bluetooth at the time) and it was nothing but a disappointment. Had too much static and the volume was too low, made it impossible to have a conversation on.Price was cheap though!"
1,Worst headset product ever.,"I have been buying headsets for cell phones for years now, and lately have been on a search for one that allows the user to actually hear, even in noisy environments. I have tried products from Motorola, Jensen, Southwestern Bell, Plantronics and even some ""no name"" headsets found on ebay. Plantronics (including all Plantronics models I have tried for home phones for years) are THE WORST. Buy *anything* else. Plantronics products are completely unusable unless you have a hearing aid and I am amazed this company is still in business. This model headset is no different."
1,Do Not Buy This.,"Poor sound quality...Awkward to wear, and unlikely to stay in...I ordered one hoping that the 5 start reviews has some merit and the the 1-2 star reviews were missing something. Bad decision...I am returning this product. I am a little upset that I have to pay shipping, since it is such a poor product.Anyway, you have been warned. You have only yourself to blame if you order it.Enjoy the day..."
1,Not happy....,"I was not happy with the product at all. The items arrived were ""old"". The rubber cracked as soon as you placed it around your ear. My credit card was charged 3/11/11. I indicated my dissatisfaction; followed the instructions for a return; returned the items on 3/23/11, via UPS ($6.62); items were received on the receiving dock on 3/29/11 at 11:05am, signed for by Oscar. My credit card statement arrived yesterday. To date (4/20/11) a refund on my credit card for the merchandise ($19.60) nor the UPS charges ($6.62) has been issued.If someone can expedite my refund it would be helpful.Thank you,"
5,Great product for the price,"I use this headset for both my cell phone while I drive and for Xbox Live. It is hard to beat spending $2 on a head set that has lasted 5 years, I bought a few more just to have around and on hand. The noise is comfortable for Xbox Live use, and you can adjust the volume on your phone.For the price, this headset is simply amazing."
5,Very good product.,"I bought the headset almost two years ago but didn't really use it until recently - as I became more aware of the impact of cell phone radiations on brains. This is a good piece of little device, easy to put on, stays on, and carries very clear voice. Highly recommended."
4,Wife loves it.,"Bought this for my wife to use with her Samsung Exclaim. For those that don't know, the device clips to your earlobe after placing the speaker in your ear. She loves being hands free now. If you want to go hands free without going the bluetooth route, get this headset. It will only work in a phone with a 2.5mm jack. Most smartphones are 3.5mm (like standard headphones)."
1,"Seller was fine, earpiece doesn't work",I bought one of these years ago and it still works. I only bought a new one because the little foam earpiece cover was coming apart; I was also concerned they might stop making them. This one was DOA. For some stupid reason they decided to add a little switch of some kind between the plug and the microphone/earpiece. My old one doesn't have this and I've never needed it. I suspect this is what's not working.
2,Sending Them Back,"Plantronics MX150 Flexible Boom Headset with 2.5 mm Plug - I am in the process now of returning these. The earpiece is so big that I can't comfortably get it in my ear. I couldn't even get through a three minute phone call without pain. Maybe I just have small ears!!For the one call that I made with it, sound was fine on my end but apparently not so great on the other end. Can't give much of a review since I couldn't really use it.Plantronics MX150 Flexible Boom Headset with 2.5 mm Plug"
3,Okay headset for price,The product functions like it should. I gave it 3 stars because it doesn't stay on the ear all that well.
5,ear peice,"good product to use if you have a cordless phone without the speaker phone option. Sound quality = good, ear fit = comfortable."
2,Not too good.,"This headset would not stay in my ear no matter how hard I tried. I like the fact that it is small, that it sounds OK, and that the person on the line could hear me OK (not great) But I could not figure out how to keep it in my ear without holding it, which defeats the purpose of having a headset!! I ordered 4 of them, they were about $3 apiece with shipping, and the first two are buzzy and could not be used. I would not recommend this product. I went to an over the head headset by Jensen, and am VERY pleased!"
3,It's ok.,Overall good sound quality. The under-ear fit is awkward however. The fit in the ear is not terribly snug.
1,"seller was fantastic, item was not","I was 0 for 2 with this model (I was later told there was something wrong with the product lot mine was shipped from.) The first one the ear piece didn't work, couldn't hear a thing. On the replacement the ear piece worked, the mic did not. I tried both headsets on multiple phones with the same results."
3,Knock-off,"Come on people, it's a knock-off. What kind of product comes in a little baggie with no wording/advertising on it? But the bootem line is it works just as well as the Plantronics version but instead of paying $35.00 I paid $1.88. Sounds good to me (no pun intended)!!"
1,Pure Garbage,"Sound was fine through the headset, however the Mic did not work at all.Waste of money and not worth returning."
1,Didn't work,I had one just like this that dies after a few years. I ordered two of these and they were both DOA. So I got one (also from Plantronics) that cost a little more and it works great.
3,Hard to get on ear correctly,"Have difficulty getting it on correctly to answer the phone, I Need to put caller on hold while I play with it,"
4,Meets my needs,"Works reasonably well as a hands- free device. Voice quality is fine for both hearing and speaking. The ear piece design fits, but I occasionally feel like I need to push it in more."
2,Not as described,"This didn't work in my phone. It was rather cheap, I ended up giving it away because it was cheaply made!"
4,Works really well,"Works as expected. The foam piece is a bit big for my ear, but the rubber hook holds it in place."
1,Does not work,"I totally agree with the other person's review:This product is not Plantronics. It is a cheap knock-off. This is evident by the lack of manufacturer markings, the packaging and the cheap sound quality. The headset is not loud enough and people I call tell me they cannot hear me. Since it was inexpensive, I'm throwing it away rather try to get my money back. Don't waste your money."
3,Works Intermittently...,"I am on the phone 12-14 hours a day, mostly on a landline phone. This piece was purchased for my cell and landline phone (with adapter), and it was very uncomfortable for the ear and for listening. But how can I complain about the price, so its now sitting in storage. Just my personal opinion, so please refer to other reviewers for more indepth information."
4,great sound,"I have found the Jabras to sound a bit muffled so was very happy to hear the clarity with this brand. Glad I ordered two as one of them didn't work, thereby explaining the four stars. But they're so inexpensive it's okay. I will most likely order more."
1,Bad sound quality!,"This ear piece looks nice and fits nice in my ears, but the sound quality is very poor. I have Motorola Droid X2 and so far I was using only wireless devices. I decide to try corded headset and that was my mistake. I was nicely surprised to see VERIZON logo on it when headset arrived, but when I made first conversation the person on the other side sounded like he was talking through layers of clothes, his voice sounded muffled. That happened with any conversation that I had so far.Update: It messed my Droid X2. It caused the phone to malfunction every time I used it. I can't use it for anything now because it simply does not do the job that it's suppose to do. Totally useless."
2,Not recommended,Iv'e tried lots of headsets. This one doesn't stay in your ear well enough. The sound I hear when I'm using it isn't loud enough.
1,Uncomfortable,I could not figure out how to make this headset stay on my ear so it ended up in the trash.
1,Not an OEM headset.,"This product is not Plantronics. It is a cheap knock-off. This is evident by the lack of manufacturer markings, the packaging and the cheap sound quality. The headset is not loud enough and people I call tell me they cannot hear me. Since it was inexpensive, I'm throwing it away rather try to get my money back. Don't waste your money."
5,SUPERB Noice Cancellation Circuitry,"I bought a couple of these Plantronics MX150 for myself and family. The ""clip"" is totally useless, BUT the clarity AND the noise-cancellation circuitry more than makes up for it's in-the-ear nuances. The units works so well that I forgot about one of the other features I was looking for in a Hands-free unit...an inline mute/answer button. I have to agree with a previous review concerning the earbud/cushion...it's rather uncomfortable FOR ME during long periods of wearing. That's because of my ear having a narrow canal and it's very difficult to find ANY kind of acceptable Hands-free unit. Family and friends couldn't even tell I was using a Hands-free unit.Overall I highly recommend the MX150. Next, I'm gonna try the Plantronics MX505...it has an inline mute/answer button."
3,pretty good,"I got this item for driving with my Audiovox CDM8910 cellphone. The sound is great, clear and noise free. The ear clip works fairly well, but it is sometimes hard to get into position; however, it tends to stay put once its in place. The clip becomes uncomfortable after about two hours, but for the first hour its fine. No pain in the ear canal, at least not for me. It does take a bit of getting used to, but it works well after a few days to figure out where to put the shirt clip, how to work the ear clip, etc. Its not perfect, but overall its a very good setup for quick calls while driving. For the price, I would buy it again.ADDENDUM: April 2007, I recently got a couple of these for my parents, improved their driving remarkably (Mom no longer needs two lanes when she drives on the freeway.) My old headphone set still works adequately though its battered and beaten. I did notice that it doesn't sound quite as good as the new ones."
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought two headsets, one didn't work completely and one worked for a day before it stopped. I should have reminded myself, ""you get what you pay for."" Save your money."
1,Worthless,Hard to put on your ear and once it's there it doesn't want to stay. Too cheap to return so I'll just save them for a future yard sale. Maybe then I'll recoup my money.
5,Plantronics MX150 Headset,"This is an excellent headset regardless of the price. I ordered two of them, and I'm extremely happy with them. I didn't understand the design at first, but it is very comfortable and stays put in my ear. The people I call say that it sounds the same as my $100 bluetooth earpiece. I use it for my cellphone and my deskphone in my office. This is a great buy!"
1,Poor design!,This stupid thing would not fit on my ear. I ended up throwing it away! Will not be ordering ANYTHING else from this company!!!
3,Great customer service,The product I received looked very used. When I contacted the seller about this they responded promptly and politely. Unfortunately I found that headset was not working well (weak connection)and contacted the seller again. They immediately offered to replace the item or give me a refund as I originally requested. I am waiting for a replacement and will update afterwards. I do appreciate their customer service and willingness to work with me. Nice to see that these days!3.5mm compatible - this headset comes with a 2.5mm to 3.5mm connector so it works with iphones
2,Low volume,"I returned this item because every person with whom I talked complained that they could not hear me very well. I seemed to be able to hear them fine, but every time I talked the other person said, ""What'd you say? Can you repeat that?"""
1,Didn't fit iPhone or normal port!,I received this item but it did not fit the iPhone or a normal phone port - it must be greater than 5 years old!
4,Loud and clear,"This little headset is loud and clear. There is a button to end the call and to initiate communication with the phone voice commands. My phone has a lock on it so the button will not work to initiate a call after the lock timeout has occured. I prefer the clarity of the corded headsets.I bought 4 headsets and 3 worked.Next time I will try them all out first before putting the spares in the supply cabinet. Fortunately, it was the first one that was broken or I might not have noticed for quite some time.Still struggling with the seller to get a return label but as far as the product - 75% of my of my order works good. Will update on specifics of the seller after I see the conclusion of the matter."
3,good,"well, its a easy product, but it is just I hope buy, it arrive on time and the way I waiting but it hurt my ear"
1,Doesn't fit the iphone 4,"It took me awhile to get the earpiece in my ear and I found it to be not only uncomfortable but painful as well (and that was without earrings). After all that fussing I then try to plug it into my phone and the opening for the plug on my iphone 4 is too big. So unfortunately, I don't know if this headset works or not."
1,Not worth it,"First of all and the final word is, not worth it. It has never worked from the moment it arrived and the design leaves a lot to be desired even if it did have the quality to make it work. Wasted money and time in this one and if this is the quality this company puts into their products, I will never purchase another one from them."
1,Doesn't Work,Did not work upon arrival. Has a Verizon sticker on it. Perhaps this item is selling for $0.03 + $4 shipping because it is overstock and/or defective. I'm choosing not to return it because it doesn't seem to be worth the effort given the low price. Thought I should share my experience in case others are considering this product.
1,WHAT!!!!!,"I was so excited when i got this headset in the mail but my excitement changed very fast. I plugged it in to my Xbox 360 controller and the mic did not work.The strange thing is i could here my friends perfectly but i wasn't able to talk to them. Then i went online and read some reviews on this item to see if it worked for the Xbox 360 and in many reviews it said, it worked.I was VERY disappointed."
2,Somewhat disappointed!,The speakers are very good - loud and clear. The microphone is horrible - weak and low. I wish I do not buy it because overall it is wasting money when receivers of my call kept complaining about my low and weak voice over the phone.
3,great earpiece but fragile,"this is a really great piece and the sound quality is fantastic. but it is a bit fragile and by manoeuvring the mouthpiece too much, the headset died on me. its also a little weird fitting the earpiece in. i bought with a 2.5 mm to 3mm jack to fit my tmoble g2 phone. worked well for a while. i'm off to buy another of these"
1,Black mailed for a refund even thought the products were defective!!,"Amazon really should have an option for zero or negative stars. I ordered 5 headsets from this company. NONE of them worked!! I emailed the company requesting a refund and was told the problem was likely with my phone. I tried every handset in 4 different phones and STILL none of them worked. I again requested a refund. The company request I return the items. I agreed to return them provided they supplied me with a prepaid return label. They ignored my request. By this time I had written a negative review here on the message boards. Shortly there after, I was contacted by an employee indicating they would give me a refund without requiring me to return the products but only if I removed my negative feedback. Their customer service is nonexistent and I am pretty sure their products are counterfeit!!!! DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY."
1,Product is very bad,"Product is very badI bought three pieces, they did not know this mediocrity, the microphone and headset do not work together wasted my time and money byI advise not to purchase"
1,Doesn't work on Panasonic head set,I bought 2 of these and neither works on my Panasonic wireless phone. It plugs in but the mike doesn't work. Says Verizon on the headsets.
2,Incompatible with 8125,"When I plugged this into my 8125, I could hear, but it wouldn't respond to my speaking. Then, I plugged it in again, and it worked. Then, it didn't. Intermittent operation is not what I wanted/paid for! I think it has something to do with the fact that it only has 2 black bands on the jack, instead of 3 ..."
4,MX150 Mobile Headset,"I bought it for my Mother....so far she seems to like it.SSays it's VERY comfortable,and that was/is a major issue for her."
4,"Hooray, I think it worked!!","I waited to write a review because we just weren't sure of the outcome. My husband used this on our Subaru and we still had bubbles in the radiator. We don't drive the car every day, but each time he drove it, he checked. Short drives produced no bubbles and longer ones did. Then, last week, no more bubbles and the car drives just fine! Hooray!! We would definitely recommend it. Besides, the price was good and it got here before the promised delivery date. Thank you!"
3,Ordered Wrong Headset,"Unfortunately, we ordered the wrong headset. The headset itself seemed to be in good shape however."
2,Bad Features and Design,"I bought this for hands-free use. It has 3 major problems.1) The microphone is poor. People cannot hear me unless I shout.2) The earpiece is difficult to put on, then will not stay on. I have to use one of my 'free' hands to keep it poked in my ear.3) The earpiece is made for tiny people, or at least, tiny ears. When attached to the ear, the earbud speaker actually sits above your ear canal. The earpiece must be bypassed for the bud to go into your ear canal in order to hear. Poor design, unless you are a corky or a chihuahua.I have already tucked it away and acquired a phone with a handset speakerphone. That made me happy.I found this handset useless. I am going to give it to my 4-year old grandaughter for her karioke."
2,"Sounds good, just doesn't fit","Maybe we are slow, but both myself and my husband could not make these fit our ears. They sound great though!"
2,cheap but not so useful,"it's light and ear-clip is quite comfy but biggest problem is the mic which is too short, and too far away from mouth. in order for other party to hear properly, you will need to talk loudly (which can be a problem in a office setting)"
2,Mic Doesn't work. Several damage.,I just bought 4 of this and 1 comes with several damage and the mic doesn't work. I don't have any issue with the other three. The one that doesn't work have scratches and the Verizon letters has been erased. This look like they put one that doesn't work every once in a while. There's a lot of difference between the three and the other one.
2,worst,Worst...Worst..Worst. This is the second time I have ordered 'Plantronics MX150 Flexible Boom Headset with 2.5 mm Plug'. What I got is again the same 'Verizon' headset which does not work properly. I do not know why amazon is still listing this product as available to purchase. The company who sold 'Plantronics MX150 Flexible Boom Headset with 2.5 mm Plug' owes me one.
2,"Sounds good, but others can't hear you","It sounds fine to me, but others keep complaining of static noise on my end.Hard for others to hear.I guess you get what you pay for.I wouldn't buy it."
1,Does NOT work with XBOX.,"In some reviews it says this works for XBOX360. Sounds are barely audible, and I do mean barely. In a totally silent room you might be able to hear it slightly."
1,complete & utter crap! company does not respond,"I purchased a wired cellphone headset.It was defective...I could hear people, but they couldn't hear me. I should have read the negative reviews....they sell garbage...even with the very cheap price it is SO NOT WORTH IT....complete junk. No one at this company got back to me.....it's not the money..it really isn't it's the fact that they don't care that they send out garbage.....don't be fooled amazon customers....they sell fake crap & I am seriously thinking of removing Amazon from my online list of places to shop...if they endorse & support companies that sell garbage that doesn't give me any confidence whatsoever in what they're selling!"
5,Just in time!,"This is just what the ""kitchen chef""(doctor) ordered! It works amazingly wonderful! My wife was absolutely grateful that I found a replacement for our older Polder timer.We searched high and low for a replacement, even tried a different brand. It didn't come close to this timer. I was so happy to find one here at Amazon.com! Thank you Amazon!"
1,"Two of these, both died within two months.","My first one was great for a month and then the temp readings were all over the map. I thought that I might have damaged it somehow, so I bought a second one and babied it. That made no difference, it still died in two months."
3,OK for the price.,I have only used this thermometer twice since receiving it. It worked perfectly the first time. The second time it registered about 80 degrees too hot when I inserted the probe in the meat. I had to put the probe in ice to bring the temperature down. I inserted the probe once again in the meat and it worked OK. I'll reserve further comment until I use it again
1,Not the same as picture!,"The cord is different than the picture, I didn't got the same stuff .very disappoint ! Hoping to use it for thanksgiving ! The cord is silicon cord, not sure can put in oven for hours!"
1,Mine is a piece of junk,"I picked up this item and hoped for the best after my last one quit working after two years. I should have known better. The FIRST time I used it the temp readout switched to ""HI"" if you pull the probe out of the connection hole it reads ""LO"" THAT'S IT! I may as well toss it in the trash as there is no contact information for Polder anywhere on the internet and DH tossed the packaging after he ""Helped"" me unpack it. I can't even find a customer service number on the web to contact for help. And I am not purchasing a replacement probe in HOPES that it may rectify this problem. If anyone happens to find a contact for help please post it. For the rest of you only buy this from a retailer that will take it back in case."
1,look elsewhere....,"No on/off switch! what else is there to say?if they are scrimping on a on/off switch imagine the level of quality on the rest of the thing. Gawd. if you buy this, forget to pull the battery and try to use months later, you're out of luck unless you have AAA batteries around."
3,No silicone sheaf on mine,"I just bought this based on one of the reviews that said it came with a waterproof probe. Alas, mine came with a standard probe that you cannot immerse in water. So this is not your thermometer if you need it to be waterproof for applications like homebrewing."
2,probe broke after three uses,"I got this as a gift, otherwise I would be sending it back. The temperature reading is dead on, but the probe broke after using it only three times. Despite the new plastic/vinyl coating that is suppose to protect the wires that go from probe to thermometer, the wire has apparently broken just a couple of inches below the probe, NOT where it would have been in the oven door. This is a poorly made product for the original $25 price tag."
4,Good Product,"I bought this thermometer for beer brewing and it works great. The probe is water tight which is great for beer making. My only wish with this product would be if the temperature alarm worked for not only increasing temperatures, but also decreasing temperatures."
2,No on/off switch and rubber cable melted,"I think the batteries probably last a long time but you can't switch the thing off - a minor irritation. I suppose my battery powered clocks all stay on all the time. I think the description should be more clear about the rubber probe cable. I think it is silicone, which is good, but it melted in my outdoor grill. I've used a lot of these kinds of thermometers and I've had good luck with polder before using the metal covered wire. The rubber cable is probably more waterproof but it seemed to melt faster than the previous metal covered one. Keep your probe cable away from the heat."
2,Terrific until the probe stopped working,"I've had this under a year and used it in the oven and for candy making. The clip was handy for the candy making but it didn't really keep the probe from touching the bottom of the pan unless you angled it just so. It seemed very accurate, even correctly measuring the ambient temp of our house. I agree with other reviewers who felt an on/off switch would have been a nice feature but I would just take the 1 AAA battery out when it went into the drawer. I would just rinse the tip of the probe after each use. Recently, the probe just stopped working right. It registers 135 degrees ambient temp and 60 degrees in ice cold water. I've tried replacing with a brand new battery but no go with the inaccurate temp. I don't think I want to pay $10 for another probe if this will happen again, esp. since I've already paid $23 for the product. Time to shop for another digital thermometer!"
2,Steel or plastic? Which is it?!,Half the product photos have plastic thermocouple sheathing and the other steel. I need something for my oven - so need steel! This is VERY IMPORTANT! Some people are complaining that the cable is melting in the oven -- please fix this!
4,Good thermometer,"Bought this to use during my Thanksgiving turkey cooking, and I am very pleased. I love the digital readout, the timer, and the fact that you can set it to go off at a selected temperature. That makes the chance of wandering off and forgetting about dinner less likely!"
1,Waste of Money,It worked five times and then stopped reading accurately below 80F. Does not work and I do not recommend anyone buy this product.
1,probe failed after 5 uses,"This thing was marvelous until it failed! Ordered it on 26 October 2012. The probe was not abused in any way, but just failed to register any logical temperature on our expensive organic free-range turkey for Thanksgiving. It was way underdone!I just need a probe thermometer that works for a year or more. Is that too much to ask?"
1,Temperature is way off,"I tried using this thermometer a couple of times but the temperature reading is way off. Today, I used it with chicken breast and it said the breast was at 180F after 10 minutes of cooking. I checked the temperature with 2 other thermometers and the actual temperature was 120-125F.I have the probe fully inserted up until the bend but it is still way off!"
5,Perfect for homebrewing,"I use this for homebrewing after reviewing several thermometers out there. This one is great because the probe can withstand to be in the liquid and is long enough to do the job. It also features and on/off switch which a lot fo the others out there do not so you can save on some batteries, even though the draw is minimal as I use this thing a lot and am still on the same battery (thankfully it only uses 1 AAA and comes with it). If you are a homebrewer, get this one. You won't be sorry."
2,Weak probe,"I was happy with it for a while, with the alarm, timer and whatnot. Then out of the blue a short seems to have developed near the probe itself. *sigh* Now the temp jumps to ""high"" and goes crazy if I move the wire a bit. Amazon however rocks and are going to replace the unit for me. So, Amazon gets 5 stars!"
1,Didn't Last Long!,"I got this for Christmas (it was on my wishlist) and I was delighted. It preformed well the first couple of times I used it. The third time, it put up an error code (Hi). When I looked at the instructions, I found that this means the cable has been damaged and needs to be replaced. What the &@%#??? I used the thing THREE times. Sent an e-mail to the company about it and, of course, got no response. My advice? Look elsewhere. Disappointed..."
5,I love this timer/thermometer.,"It's perfect, i have no idea what I did without it. It doesn't have an on/off switch (it's just meant to be left on) which bothered me at first, but i've gotten over it. It's really easy to use and when making candy i just clip it in the pan and wait for it to beep, it's fabulous!"
4,gret but...,This is great product - easy to use. Wish it had an on/off button - it's a pain taking the battery out to turn it off.
1,Tweaked out on Induction,"I have an induction stove:GE Profile : PHB925SPSS 30 Freestanding Induction Range, 5 Cooking Zones, Convection, Self Cleanand this gadget completely tweaked out when I put it a kettle to watch my boiling water. The timer started incrementing and decrementing without any buttons being touched and the alarm would randomly turn on and off as well.Completely worthless."
3,"Accurate, but broke in only a few months","I had originally bought one of these to use at work (I am a cook) and I loved it so much I bought a second one for home. The temperature alert is a great feature when making candy or roasting meat. However, I have had both for less than a year and they have BOTH had the glue on their magnets come undone so that it will no longer attach to the side of my fridge. When this happened to one, it fell on the floor and the display was damaged. I sure wish things were made to last a bit longer these days."
2,good unless you get a faulty one,I too got a faulty product. My first one could not register temperatures below about 70 degrees. Amazon was great about sending me a new one. I've only used the new one once and so far it's working OK. I'll update this review if I encounter problems with it.
4,Mike,"Seems to work pretty good. Temp is always about 5 degrees lower that my past thermometer. However it hovered between 211 and 212 in boiling water. My other thermometer just switched to High at 212 degrees so not sure how it compared exactly. Does not have preset temps so moving say 30 degrees means 30 pushes to get to desired temps which I guess is minor inconvenience. Alarm and when pressing buttons is too loud, again minor. I have had enough thermometers to know to keep the probe out of direct heat so have not had probe problems. Bottom line I feel it is doing the job of giving me meat temperatures, but have had a little easier and more pleasant. Overall happy"
4,Polder Cooking Timer/Thermometer with Bonus Pan Clip,"I bought this as a gift for my brother, who is a chef. He is very pleased with it."
1,stopped working,I used this 3-4 times within a few months and it worked fine. Now it won't register anything other than 10 degrees and refuses to work.
4,"Good, but probe was not great.","The thermometer does what it needs to, but take that prove and throw it in the trash--didn't go past 450 degrees F. Everything else worked wonderfully!"
4,Great price,"Used it for Turkey on Thanksgiving. Love the alarm, cord is long and works well. Hope to get much more use out of it."
1,Poor Quality,I have used this thermometer twice and it is already broken. The temperature readout is around 115 at room temperature.
3,Best inexpensive thermometer - but not rated for high-heat,"I bought this thermometer 2 years ago and it worked great for oven use, cooking Thanksgiving Turkeys, etc. I used it on the grill and after that, the temperature stopped reading. I bought a replacement thermometer, which worked until I used it on the grill (again!). I then spent a lot of time researching thermometers - and apparently the heat range rating matters ;) This thermometer will not work on the grill or other high-heat conditions. If you're looking for a serious thermometer, check out thermoworks.com. They have excellent (but expensive) models that can handle extreme heat, or have hypodermic needle-size prods."
1,"Great concept, just threw mine away","Interesting that both the positive and negative reviews are well written and true. It went through batteries like popcorn (only a single AAA battery, cheap and easy to replace. Just inconvenient as it always seemed to be dead). After about a month, the display went out again. I changed the battery. No display appeared. It had died after just a few weeks.I'm replacing it with something less complicated and more durable."
3,Probe Cord NOT metal shielded,"Although the photo of the item on Amazon clearly shows a metal-shielded probe cord, the real cord is plastic. ""high heat"" plastic, whatever that means. I wanted to have a metal probe to use on the grill (at low temps, not steaks - i have an instant read for that). It may still work at 300/350 degrees, since normal ovens are that hot - we'll see. I use it more for the timer when grilling than anything else.I agree with the rest of the reviewers that not having a off switch is bizarre, but it's not a deal breaker for me. The magnets are strong enough to stick the thing to my grill, and the timer display is large enough to see from a distance."
2,Polder thermometer,"I'm surprised no one else has pointed out that you can't turn it off except by removing the batteries, an unecessary inconvenience.For this reason I wouldn't give it a good rating."
1,Didn't work out,"I tried it four times (pork roast, 2 cuts of beef, and a meatloaf) and it was not useful. The reading was so far off it was comical. It's possible that it was defective, I don't know. This was my first in-oven themometer; I have nothing to compare it to. It's also possible my technique was not correct, but as this item does not come with detailed directions, I don't know. The tip of the probe was certainly somewhere near the center of each piece; you would think that the reading would at least be close.I tried it. It is now in the trash."
3,Unsure if it's accurate,"I don't know if this product is reading the temperature's accurate, or if I'm not inserting it in the correct spot. When I measured the temperature of a steak, it read it was medium-well and when I cut into it; it was rare. Do thermometer's only work for large pieces of meat (like roasts or whole turkeys)? Anyway, I'm unsure if this product is good or not. Sorry!!"
3,Fun While it Lasted - Updated for User Error,"I've had this thermometer about 3 months now and it has functioned well as recently as last night. Tonight, I saw it sitting on the counter and read 102 degrees. I can assure you, my house is not that warm.Disappointing when you like a product for functionality only to have it stop functioning in such a short time.Updated 2/1/13 - It is quite possible I damaged the probe with improper cleaning technique. I was researching a replacement to this thermometer and found almost every digital probe thermometer out there had complaints about the probe going out in short order. Finally, on a blog about meat smokers, I found a thread that discussed the issue and it was pointed out that when cleaning the probe, care must be taken to not immerse where the probe meets the cable -- that water getting into the probe from this point was the most common reason for the failure."
1,probe doesn't last,I bought this in March 2012 and by October 2012 the probe failed. I used it about 10 times. The manual said if the temperature comes up with HI or LO the probe is shot. What a waste.
2,Not for use in smokers,The timer function is great and the temperature is accurate until the probe falls apart.I have gone through 3 of the probes when used with my smoker.I have used it for brewing many times with success but two smokes and the wire separates at the probe.TheMaverick RediChek Remote Wireless Smoker Thermometerhas proven to be a more reliable thermometer for use with a smoker.I do not know why the wire falls apart at the probe when used with a smoker but it does and it has done it to me more than once.
2,Polder cooking thermometer,It's hard to believe anyone makes a thermometer probe that melts in the oven. The plastic probe cable withstands only up to 392 degree. I often roast meats at 400 to 450 degrees so I can't possibly use this probe. What are they thinking???
3,Works great when they work,First one came in defective. Sent me a new probe and it is working fine now but reviewers all claim the probes are very short life.......................... am sure I will need to replace it shortly!
4,Okay,"Good thermometer but it only goes up to 395F, not a good oven thermometer if you cook regularly. However, it does switch between C and F"
1,Broke after 3 uses,"I have used only 3 times and I believe it is broken- the temperature is registering as ""lo"". I understand that the probes aren't made to last and that they sell reasonably-priced replacements, but after only 3 uses I think that's a little ridiculous. I called their customer service and left a message- I will update my review after I hear from them. It is now 2 days before thanksgiving and I think I may be out of luck!!"
1,Went Haywire 3 Months Later,"We have had two of these thermometers. The first lasted two years then began sending meaningless data. The second lasted only three months - then went haywire. Kept displaying ""Hi"" immediately after inserting probe into the base. Would not recommend product.WSC"
1,Piece of junk,"Plain and simple - this thing can't handle home brewing. Before I went to ferment, the temperature was stuck at 117 degrees for a loooong time - even when the wort was clearly much, much cooler than that - and I confirmed it with another thermometer I borrowed from someone. By the way - this was only after 1 session. I am extremely careful with my equipment. Many people seem to have a heavy hand with the thermapen for long periods of time with no problem. Not only did I waste my money, but my time of having to take an extra step to not kill the yeast due to an inaccurate wort reading. Look somewhere else."
4,Was helpful for my smoker,"I bought this to go with my new smoker. This allows me to monitor food temp without messing with the smoker and letting out all the heat. The alarm set up is very simple. One bonus is the magnetic base that allows you to stick it to the side of the stove, smoker or whatever. Very nice, be sure not to submerge the probe in water, just wipe everything down with a soapy rag and you are good to go."
1,Failed right out of the box,"This product is visually pleasing, but also exceedingly frustrating. Unfortunately, the first time that I went to use it (while I was getting ready to roast a turkey!), it failed to read temperature properly. This resulted in an emergency trip to the grocery store to purchase a traditional meat thermometer and a delayed dinner. Like other reviewers, I can attribute this to a faulty probe. I returned the thermometer and purchased another product instead."
2,Good for a while then probe broke,This was a great thermometer until the probe broke on the 3rd use I doubt I'll buy another considering the probe is $10 by it's self. I'll stick with the old fashioned non-electric thermometers from now on.
3,"Designed for oven use, not BBQ or grill","Instructions say that this can be used in the BBQ, but only as an instant read thermometer. Unfortunately, as an instant read it's kinda slow. It also has NO calibration capability; fortunately two of these units read the same temperature so I'm pretty sure the temp is accurate enough. As far as I can tell from researching customer comments, as well as my personal experience, none of the probes are built well and they are not interchangeable between units. If you want these things to last, follow the instructions: do not immerse the probe or it's cable in water. Be careful when washing; if water gets into the probe (through the cable) the probe will stop working. The probe must be sterilized before use, but only the part that goes into the meat."
1,Polder thermometer,"Don't buy, this is a piece of junk , never did give the right temp when compared to my other thermometers . The switch ,small and located on the bottom of the unit,would get hung up from day one and now after a couple months os usage is toast . Went in the garbage money wasted."
1,Didn't last long.,"I used it in the oven for roasts, chickens, turkeys, etc. After about 20 uses it started freaking out, so I replaced the batteries which did not help. So I bought a new probe, thinking the wear and tear of being closed in the oven door (as it was DESIGNED TO DO!) disabled the cable in some way. Worked fine for another few months, and now it's giving wonky readings again. I am NOT about to buy another probe, so here I am on Amazon to find another oven probe thermometer to try...only a little over a year later."
1,Lasted 9 months,This unit already irritated me with restricted functionality compared to the timer/thermometer it replaced. Then the probe broke after 9 months of light use. What a piece of junk!
3,Why fuss about an unneeded On/Off switch?,"There's no need for an On/Off switch. I've had one of these ten years. In that time, I've replaced the battery twice. I bet even if I removed the battery every time I put it away (which would be a hassle since I use its timer feature almost daily), I still would have needed the new batteries due to the batteries getting old.Only three stars since after ten years it's falling apart and the temperature probe no longer works. But the timer still works and I got a good eight years out of it."
1,Nice product except that the probe broke after 3 uses,I had high hopes for this product since I really like to cook. Unfortunately the probe quit working after 3 uses. I carefully store the probe and unit in their own drawer. Also the lack of an on/off switch is stupid design. I'm going to search for a more robust probe and hope I can get the thermometer working again.
1,Buyer beware,2nd use broken probe. I'll let you know how polder responds. One roast did fine second not so much Light usage.Responded immediately to email. Sending replacement11month no replacement
1,Broken after using it twice...,"When it worked, it worked beautifully! I measured the temperature of water (water has to be a certain temp. when combining with yeast) and I roasted a chicken. The chicken was cooked perfectly and I was SO excited that I finally had a way to measure the temp. Unfortunately, the oven use must have caused it to malfunction and now it's constantly reading a temperature that is much higher than normal temperature (~130 deg. F). This was very disappointing. :("
5,Gets the job done.,"I have used this device only once, on a pork roast. I turned out as I expected, very nicely done."
5,works perfect,"buy it it wont let you down. love the strong magnet and loud alarm, cook by time or temperature, good price"
1,"Terrible, defective out of the package.","Opened up the package this morning to cook my turkey. The LCD read ""Lo"" when I turned it on after inserting the probe into my turkey. I just though maybe it didn't register a temperature until it hit a certain temperature. After an hour or so of cooking, I got on Amazon to read reviews and it turns out the ""Lo"" means my probe is bad. I saw a couple of people say the battery could be low, I replaced the battery with a brand new one, still ""Lo"" on the LCD screen. So I have this turkey in my oven and no way to know when it's done. I bought a natural turkey without one of those inaccurate pop-up thermometers stuck in them. No way I'm spending $10 for another probe that might not even work when I get it. I would rather spend $20 or more on a better brand and model."
5,love it,Use it to not over cook expensive cuts of meat. I love it.Cooked a perfet turky breast too! Now the breast is my favorite part of the bird.

4,Crosman Cartridges,"It is important to note that these are Crosman brand cartridges. They have been known to be too large for some guns(more especially pistols). They perform fine,but if you know your gun cant take these then don't buy them."
2,WTH?,"I love Robin Givens, but I did not love this play. Either the script did not have direction or the director did not have a clear vision, either way....HATED IT!!!"
1,The worse acting I've ever seen in a Stage Play and I have a large number of plays in my collection. The acting was terrible!,"The acting in this production was terribly weak. Everyone seemed extremely novice, even Robinn Givens, surprisingly. It was as if the script writer just didn't have a great plan as to how he was going to segue through the beginning, middle and end phases of this play. I feel like someone owes me money for taking precious time out of my day to order and simply wait on this play to arrive. Awful, awful, awful!!!"
3,Viewable,"Bad acting and the plot was not seamless, during some parts it seemed as if the actors were unaware of the lines."
1,ok,This movie wasnt all that intresting to me at all. i kept falling asleep 4 times on this movie before i can finish the end. This is on netflix. Its okay to watch but aint worth paying money for
4,great explanations,"I consider that this video is very good for advance people that wanted to go deep onto aikido`s path, but may be not so usefull for beginers because is not really basic, it is about ki, and mind, also technics but from this points of view that is also difficult for senior students. So is great material from a person that was a direct student of o`sensei Ueshiba, and also one of the few westerns that practice under the master, that makes unic the video. I wish this can help your desition of choosing this DVD."
2,A battery with some major setbacks.,"I was grateful to be able to purchase a new battery for my phone with out having to purchase a new phone. However the only con I have about this battery is that the phone will out of the blue just shut down. I cant just turn the phone back on, I have to take the battery off the phone to reset it and then turn the phone back on. This is quite a problem when I don't know when it turns off (it doesn't make the usual powering off song.) So if I am expecting an important call and don't know that the phone is off this sometimes has created a problem."
4,Hair it is!,This is very informative and gives helpful tips along the way. It is definitely for beginners! It would be nice to have a 'summary' section with the highlights that could be accessed from a menu for 'refreshers!'I had this already and then got it again to five as a gift to my sister. She liked it and was able to cut quite a lot of time from her hair care regime!
4,Great except for the very end,"This is the first book by Doherty that I've read and I had no idea it was book three in a series. It's certainly good enough to make me want to go back and read the others, and the book doesn't require you to need to have read the first two if you know a little something about Alexander and his campaign. I thought the historical sense was excellent, though I think some inaccuracies were present, for example the first known corridor isn;t until Rome, and then not widely used until the 17th century, I thought, so the mention of them in the farmhouse is anachronistic. This is however, primarily a who dunnit through the point of view of the doctor, all while the build up to a city seige takes place. Though some of the everyday scenes are a bit clunky, the battle sequences are wonderful! My only disappointment was the ending, it was all a bit Scoobie Doo."
5,Absolutely wonderful for toddlers!,"I grew up with the original movie, as did most of us, and i still enjoy it tremendously to this day. Ever since I had my daughter 3 and a half yrs ago, I've been waiting for the day that she will be old enough to really appreciate the original film. The Tom and Jerry version is the perfect way to introduce little ones to this brilliant classic! It plays out almost exactly like the original, and there is even a version with the sepia tone in the beginning just like the original. Only difference really is that its animated, and Tom and Jerry are placed into the movie as Dorothy's protectors. They don't take over though and are placed into the story very well. I loved that the characters looked very similar to original characters and they even used voices that are very similar. At 27, I even really enjoy watching this and my 3 yr old LOVES it! Its truly a must have for ""Wizard of Oz"" fans with little ones!!!"
3,glad i found it,just what she wanted couldn't find it anywhere. thanks for making my shopping easier just a few clicks and i found it
3,Check the box!,"I purchased for Grandsons after they watched it on TV. Ordered and wrapped as a gift. When they opened the box - EMPTY!! No dvd!!! So sad for little boys! Contacted Amazon and returned empty box. Received new one in two days - great service. DVD was in box! Popped into player and all the previews are in Japanese! Luckily the movie is spoken in English! I was so worried the boys would be disappointed again! My big concern is - are these ""Legal DVD's"" I am purchasing? I count on Amazon to guide me to proper products - now I am a little concerned:("
1,No DVD,When I went to purchase this product I thought I was buying the DVD. Come to find out that wasn't the case. I wanted to have the DVD at home but instead the only way my son can watch this is on my computer. There are time that I need my computer and if he is watching the movie I can't use my computer. Needless to say I am not happy with my purchase.
5,An excellent overview of the science of healing,"Diane Goldner has done a wonderful job of exploring the world of healing. Through her exploration of healers and their work and of scientific researchers and their work, she has accomplished the very difficult task of making sense of the intersection of these two worlds and explaining their relationship in an interesting and accessable way. This book is for the open-minded reader. Some belief systems will be in for a good stretch, and yet the evidence presented in this book is undeniable. Diane presents her findings with scientific clarity and journalistic objectivity as well as with the compassion and care of a true seeker."
3,Reeks of New Age Philiosophy,"I had gotten about halfway through when it started to talk about a lot of New Age beliefs. While I do believe in spontaneous healings and the power of the mind as well as the laying on of hands and mental imaging of healing, I do not buy into allowing ""spirits"" to enter my body and convey a healing, but ""Thank you"" very much anyways."
3,natina's life is over indeed,kurupt mad at foxy for so called cheating on him with dmx hooked up with tina and they made this song dissing her.
1,harold melvin & the blue notes 15 all- time greats,"I was very disappointed with this CD. It was remakes and live music, and the remakes were terrible. I don,t think that Teddy Pendergrass was even on this cut.I would not recommend this CD."
2,"Too much reflection, too few answers.","I am not neutral in reviewing this book as I was expecting a thorough treatment of the doctrine of Humanity. The book is instead, just like the rest in the series, an attempt to think beyond the already stated dogmas in major Systematic Theologies. He wants to grasp contemporary social issues and give a theological reflection upon them. But even with that in mind, Sherlocks book wasn't too good. It was a lot of abstract reflection, small thoughts here and there, and a few fragments of admonition to the church. He didn't prove his cases. Also he has a habit of stating the case of a paragraph in the second sentence, instead of the first, which confused me all the time.Mark Mathur Sweden"
3,Maybe I got a defective one,"I have two of these wine sealers, one for home and one for work. I bottle my own fruit and vegetable juice and take it to work with me. The black one I have at work is much better than the white one I have at home. My black one definitely works faster, but I don't think there is a reason the white one doesn't work just as fast. I am guessing it's defective."
4,Great!,I prepared a set with th glass markers and It was a great gif for some family and friend in Chrismas.
5,"Easy, small and useful","If you enjoy bottled wine this is essential. by pumping all the air out of the bottle my wine stays fresh. I might have several bottles of wine open at a time to go with different meals, I can saver a $35 bottle of wine throughout a few weeks of meals and not feel I need to drink it right up."
4,Boring but good.,"BPM, not to be confused with PBS, MPG, or MPH. There is not chance of that because you never forget your book on Business Process Modeling, not because it blows you away, but because of how many naps you take while reading it. The subject is very boring, not for your everyday programmer.It takes a different kind of developer to love BPM, and to take the time to learn BPEL, WSFL, XLANG, or YAWL, and to do research into Petri Nets and Pi-Calculus.But there is a need, and to be honest, even though I was bored, I know that this was a very good book explaining the technologies that are out there, the BPM Design Patterns, The ""languages"" and some examples using them, and a good amount of diagrams showing ""workflow"".So, if you are one of the lucky few who either love BPM or just have a job at Filenet, then this is a great book for you to pick up."
3,"Nice book, but terrible edition","The book is not bad - I did not have any prior knowledge on BPM and so I got a nice introduction. Nevertheless, beware of buying either this or any other kindle book that might contain tables or formulas. This is the second time I find out that both are not presented correctly, making it a pain to understand mathematical an scientific concepts."
5,"Lean Assessment, Simple and To-The-Point","We use this Lean Assessment every six months. It has allowed our project teams to see progress throughout production and administrative areas. As you review the Assessment with a team, it has allowed us to focus on the right improvement projects using the concepts and tools of Lean. Highly recommended!"
5,Ivan the Great,"My whole family on my stepdad's side share the same traits and stories Ivan does. That stands to reason as he is my stepdad's cousin. If you think Ivan is one of a kind, your right but much of his family are simillar. Another reviewer made reference to Ivan being a throwback that will soon not be commonly found among our culture. I agree completely. I think there should be more shows like this one wherein the older generation gets to tell their stories, particularly the rest of the Thompsons and the Martins (My stepdad's Immediate family). This story is great and to me it was like being arround the old kitchen table at mom and dad's listening to the old stories of uncles, cousins, and other kinfolk. Great Job Ivan!!!"
2,Makes Me Sick,"I am trying to be unbiased and rate the movie on its overall quality, rather than the offensiveness of the content. It WAS in a way interesting--no, that's not quite the word--I think it was perhaps ""educational"" to see just how pathetic people can be. But it is also very depressing. This delusional man talks as if he knows alot about women and matchmaking, but his own marriages have been unsuccessful. This is largely because the women wanted to learn English, make friends, and come and go as they pleased. He frequently compares women to horses and his matchmaking to horse dealing. His clients are looking for women who are more subservient than American women and the Mexican women are looking for men who treat women more as equals than they feel Mexican men do, leaving you imagining future disasters. More misogyny than I could stomach."
4,Pretty Good,This is a very good introduction to a very good british gisrl band. I prefer Girls Aloud however since they tend to be funnier and more inventive.
5,3 GREAT GAMES IN ONE--WONDERFUL,i PURCHASED THIS ITEM FOR A FRIEND FOR CHRISTMAS. SHE LET ME SIT AND TRY IT OUT. I WAS IMMEDIATELY HOOKED. THANKS
1,Misleading picture,"This product is not good for the Zire 71 as pictured. The overlays are way too small, and I have to return it to Amazon.com. Customer service was prompt in accepting responsibility but it's a waste of everybody's time and the wrong picture is still on the production description."
1,Wrong Picture,"I have a Palm Zire 71 and I bought this product when I saw the picture of the Zire 71, but when I saw the product it was only for the Palm Zire. They have to remove the picture, because it confuses"
2,Caution,"This book has some questionable parts that do not confirm 100 percent God,s Word, among them, somebody being exhausted and thirsty in heaven and rushing to drink from the water of life river.Good knowledge of the Bible and caution required for reading this book.Aurel T."
2,Not very interesting,"This book gives good visuals on heaven but that got tiresome after a while, especially when things didn't make sense, such as the 'young wife' who had grown children and had apparently lost many family members already. The beginning of the book where the author talks of the bible etc. was interesting and worthreading but the rest seemed to be descriptions that were very similar. I did get bored after a while.What was sorely lacking was what did they learn? What divine information was given to them? One part said they went to a meeting where Jesus was speaking and Ithought, great! here we go with some helpful, hopeful words but nothing was said about the talk, just physical descriptions.If you want to really get a good idea of Heaven, read Betty Eadie's book, Embraced by the Light. You come away a changed, more aware person."
3,A bit disappointed. We already read the books the author takes his stories from.,We were looking fwd to hearing something new. This is a good book for someone who doesnt read often and hasn't previously read the popular heaven ones.
5,Correction,It's a great book written by Henry Heimlich and Lawrence Galton. You have the first names with the wrong people.
2,Confusing,"I don't get it. The picture is clearly of a screw-bell french horn gig bag, but the description says it's for a fixed-bell french horn. So whoever is selling this item, it would help if you clarified if it's fixed or non-fixed(screw-bell). I know that's not what revews are for, but I was confused."
1,Partial Truth,"The video has a half truth view, The view of Woodrow Wilson is very liberal and does not tell of the Socialistic agenda he was forcing on our country. I actually threw this dvd in the garbage after I watched it. Any false history is not history but should be considered fiction."
5,A wonderful performance,"I'm a bit mystified by the criticism in some of the reviews below of Davis for being uninvolved in this performance. I just don't hear any lack at all - to me it's by far the most successful instalment in his new Berlioz cycle, and avoids the crassness that can so often come into Berlioz performances generally. It's beautiful Berlioz playing, in a literal sense - full of beauty, yet with immense power and precision. This doesn't happen by accident.I don't share other's enthusiasm for Chung's recording, which contains orchestral playing that is energetic but sloppy, in harsh sound. Okay, Chung has Terfel, but Davis' cast is perfectly fine at worst and superb at best, and in any event let's be blunt here - as a vocal writer, Berlioz was a great orchestral composer. The important stuff in Berlioz happens in the orchestra, and Davis and the LSO sweep all before them in this recording."
5,nut fanciers,"These hazelnuts are the most flavorful we have ever tasted. We have sampled many other brands, including bulk from the health store, and we have come back to these and will stick with these. They are worth any additional cost."
4,Good book,"As a retired Navy photojournalist I have been a fan of Tim Page's work for years, however his book Page after Page puts a whole new spin on Page the man. Yes I was aware of the drug use and abuse by many members of the military and media in Vietnam, but I was deeply disappointed to learn, from Page himself, according to his book, that he was a drug addict from the day he arrived in Vietnam until the day he left. But, then, I suppose one does what he/she feel is necessary to survive."
1,Horrible,"I have the V551 and this battery fully charged, lasted aobut 8 hours. I go to work and don't even talk on the phone, I get off and it's down to 1 bar. If I talk anytime during the day it'll shut off before I get home. I wish I could get 3 days out of this battery!!! Oh and I had Amazon send me another thinking the first was a defect...NOPE! 2nd one was just as bad. Shell out the money and get a name brand battery...that's what I'll end up doing."
1,Buyer be aware!,"After the original battery started losing some power, I ordered this generic battery hoping for an improvement since the original battery was a year and a half old. After the initial charge, to my horror, this new battery's life is about one third of the life of the original year and a half old battery. More specifically, after a full charge, this battery lasts about one hour of actual `on-line' use and about one day of `cell on' but no actual `on-line' use. I call this highway robbery. I wouldn't recommend this battery to my worst enemy. Buyer, be aware! I would give this battery a 0 star rating, but the lowest I can rate it is 1 star!"
2,Not very good,"After a year, my V551 original battery decreased to the point where I needed a new one.I've had this replacement for about 2 months and there are glaring problems with it:1) While charging this replacement battery, the phone shuts off. I cannot charge and have the phone on at the same time. The original does not have this problem.2) The battery life is 2-3 days with low use. This is far less than the orginal battery when it was new."
3,Not the best Wipeout available,"I can't play this game after playing Wipeout 3 - the latter blows the doors off of it. Don't get me wrong, Wipeout XL is a good game, but compared to Wipeout 3 the graphics are muddy and kind of ugly and I hate all the in-game corporate advertising (which is all over the game). Save your money and buy Wipeout 3."
2,Excellent game...BAD multiplayer!!!,"I bought this game, because it was on Gamespot's Greatest Games of All Time list. The game itself is amazing! It's fast, it's fun, and has excellent replay value; however, this game requires that you have two different discs along with two different playstation consoles linked together in order to do multiplayer... What's up with that!!! This game would have been simple to provide split-screen for, so why did they have to make multiplayer so friggin' complicated and expensive. The chances of you finding another friend with a playstation 1 and another copy of Wipeout XL is almost zero! I wanted to play my brother in this game so bad, and I can't because it requires a friggin' console link! That's just bogus!"
5,An Irish Holiday,"What a derlightful timne we shared watching and listening to these talented, charming people. The charm of the Irish warms any heart. Such a variety of performers! I loved the setting - made me want to return to the home of my grandfather. Anyone who enjoys the Celtic aura will enjoy this dvd. Glad I purchased it on Amazon."
5,Great holiday viewing,"This DVD was a replacement for the VHS tape I had, so I knew exactly what I was getting. The production is wonderful and anyone that is ""head-over'heels"" with Ireland like my family members are, must have it. It has become one of the Christmas rituals in our family ( along with Emmet Otter's Jug Band Christmas). All the performances are of high quality. I even enjoy watching it ""off-season""."
3,Not that good,"If you are looking for traditional Irish cultural entertainment, this is just marginal. Not very entertaining. Many of the songs are not very good. There is a lot of conversation between the artists about the religious meanings of Christmas being lost (It seems that it is lost on them anyways)."
2,Irish Christmas show,"I thought this would have been about an Irish Christmas music and some of it was, but it was some sort of TV special with guests that i did not recongize and some discussion of the holidays. The music was great the discussion was boring."
3,A very intriguing book,"I see, from the other reviews, that many boys and girls are reading this book in school. Maybe this is not a very good way to enjoy it, because they just have to read it! This is not my case: I read it just for personal interest and I found it very intriguing. Dickens, I think, is at his best when he speaks out of his personal experience; in this historical book he is maybe a little less convincing. But he is able, all the same, to create a wonderful plot, with some unforgettable passages. Sidney Carton on the steps of the Guillotine, holding the hand of the little seamstress, is simply unforgettable..."
1,Bisphenol A (BPA)??????,"I bought the steamer to cook vegetables to live a healthier life. It certainly cooks vegetables in a convenient manner, but I looked at the bottom of the hard plastic food trays included with this unit and I observed the number ""7,"" which suggests the plastic food trays might contain Bisphenol A, a chemical that has been the subject of numerous recent news media reports that raise questions about heating and the possibility of Bisphenol A leaching into foods where it might be linked to potentially serious health issues. I wrote Salton, the company that manufacturers this unit and I asked if the company could confirm if the food trays contained Bisphenol A. Several weeks have passed and there has been no response to my letter. In my letter, I also asked Salton to consider providing alternative trays made of a different material. I wish the company would answer my letter."
4,Easy to Use,It came with avery nice little recipe book and instructions. I have no complaints and it's been very easy to use.I haven't used the bowl that comes with it yet which the book says can be used for steaming 1 cup of rice at a time. If you really need a rice steamer I would say it would be too small but we don't eat a large amount of rice at one time here so it will work for us.Very nice 10 minute keep warm feature on it too.
5,EXCELLENT STEAMER,"THIS IS THE BEST AND THE LARGEST STEAMER I HAVE EVER SEEN.. THE CONVENIENCE OF HAVING THREE SEPARATE COMPARTMENTS WITH SEPARATE TIMERS IS TERRIFIC.. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO ANY ONE.. IT STEAMS CORN ON THE COB PERFECTLY, AND I CAN MAKE FOOD FOR FOUR IN IT. THIS WAS DEFINITELY WORTH IT... I LOVE IT... A GREAT PURCHASE.."
4,Great book for truck lovers,"We had this book from the library and my son, who is nearly 3, loved it so much I went ahead and bought a copy. He loves hearing about each one of the types of trucks. It has some nice little rhymes to tell about what each truck does."
3,Monster Truck Book,"My Grandson loves these books! I was a little disappointed however as while I knew this was a used book, there was not mention that the binding on the book was broken. I had to tape the book up to keep the pages from falling out. Will probably not last very long what with a 3 year old reading it."
4,Fun truck book... kids will love it!,"If you have a kid who's into trucks, this book will really wow them. The pictures are cartoony and bold, the feel of the text is lively and fun. The only downside is that the rhyming verses don't scan well -- Todd seems to have a hard time getting the meter to flow, and often puts big, work truck-oriented words in in ways that don't really fit. It's clunky and makes the text difficult to read. But it's still a great book... kids will love it! (ReadThatAgain!)"
4,watersports camera,"I purchased this camera for watersports only. Have used in on my boat in rough weather and I have found it small, compact, and easy to use. The quality picture digitally is good but have not yet printed. Am very happy with the camera."
2,A not such a good camera,"As far as taking pictures, it isn't bad, but there is no optical viewfinder, and the LCD screen is impossible in bright light. It gives new meaning to ""point and shot."" And there is no automatic lens cover, so the lens is vunerable and gets dirty easily."
2,Was Nice until it froze.,"I bought this camera at the very beginning and was kinda surprised and happy with the underwater pictures it takes. It did froze a few times, but all recoverable ones. After a while it began to take overexposed pictures with horizontal lines. I know that it happened with several other people too and there is no garantie that it will be fixed. I would go with another options from now on."
3,Could use improvement,"I have bought two of these cameras because I like them and they are easy to use. However, both of the LCD screens have broken even though I tried to be careful and it will cost money to get them fixed. I use my camera on the job where I remain very active and need a camera that can stand up to the elements. If it had rubber bumpers and a screen that was more protected, I think it would be a great investment."
2,If Only.....,"Great idea, too bad the pictures sucked.Great size, excellent menu navigation. Always wants to use flash. The water has to be really clear for the photo to come out. You need a tripod, photos without flash are always blurry.maybe they'll get it right next time."
5,Excellent all-round camera,"I am very impressed with this small, easy-to-use, fun camera. First of all, it is very stylish. Its body is small and shiny and its screen is quite large. I was actually surprised by how small it is because the pictures make it seem about average size. In terms of performance, the five megapixels, built-in memory, and 3x optical zoom set it out from digital cameras of similar price. Plus, its water proof and durable. In all, you really can't go wrong with this camera."
3,"OK Pics, bad video","Great if you only plan to take pictures, but the video is really fuzzy. I bought it to take fishing with me, and I like to take short vidoes as well. Unfortunately, the videos are poor quality."
5,Pentax Optio WP Camera,Waterproof allows pictures to be taken in rain or mist worry free. Small overall size with large view screen. Camera + portabe printer+ laptop= mobility
1,Not Waterproof At All,"I bought this camera to take on a vacation to Mexico, after about a an hour of poolside activities in which the camera got wet it refused to turn on and when I opened the battery compartment water leaked out from everywhere. I'm taking it home as soon as I get back."
4,Pentax Digital Camera,"Althought I haven't capitalized on all of the features yet, I do believe that this is a good camera. I still can't believe that it's possible to take it underwater. I plan on reading the book soon so I can figure it all out."
2,wondering why,"I have owned several digital cameras, including the WR33, and a great deal of photo experience. I like the size and shape of this camera and have always been a fan of Pentax. However, I wonder why Pentax did not include a view finder. It clearly would be a plus. My experience with LCD's is they wash out in bright sun and thus useless. When your on water, you are usually in bright sun. Do others have thoughts on the matter? Does it make a difference (I did note the comments in the one review)."
3,"H2O proof - yes, quality photos - no.","I purchased this camera because I take a lot of action photos on the water. After losing the last to rainy weather in AK, I opted for the Optio. This is an easy to use, waterproof unit which is nice. Unfortunately the picture quality totaly lacks. Since the quality of my photos is important, I wouldn't buy this camera again."
4,Excellent value,"As soon as I took it our of the box, I was not disappointed. It was soft and luxurious with a very shapely and stylish look. As soon as I put it on and buttoned it I looked and felt quite stylish, ready to dash out the door to dinner and a date! There is a one-button closure with an inside button closure to securely wrap you in style. I was quite amazed at how lightweight the coat was. I ordered my normal size and it was a perfect fit with room to wear a sweater underneath without compromising the overall look or creating a bulky look. The lining is lightweight. The length was beyond mid-calf, not to the ankle, but I am 5'-8"". This is perfect to wear with jeans, slacks, skirts and simple dresses. The shawl collar easily unfolds to add warmth while dashing in and out of the car. Add a scarf to dress it up or down. A fantastic value for the price!"
4,Snug fit,"If you buy one of these, I hope you have a strong grip. You'll need it to install this. Afterward, it does look pretty good though.My Jeep has shoulder belts, and the piece for the top of the roll bar was just a bit off at the top mounting bolts for the seatbelts. It's not a huge concern, but the belts rub just enough to not retract as fast as they did before I added the bar cover. The part covering the bars going toward the back were a bit shorter than I'd like, too. That's why it gets 4 stars."
1,Useless and dangerous,"The spout construction is terrible. It is impossible to pour without spilling. The mechanism is clunky, and the o-ring at the spout does not seal well. The hard plastic spout makes transportation and storage hard, and I am ever afraid of braking it. The cap is also useless. It is made of hard plastic with no seal. Its hook connects to the spout at location which obstructs the pouring. I tried to find the can with the flexible tube that slides inside it and is pulled out when pouring, but nobody sells those locally. I could only find this terrible type. This piece of crap is hard to use and outright dangerous. Good intention implemented in a very wrong way. I am sure it was created in order to satisfy some legislation, and I am writing this review in hope that the design gets reviewed and a replacement is implemented."
3,OK but don't like the spout,This gas can is good for the price but I don't care for the spout. I changed it to my old flexible spout that fits this can. It's much easier to use. I guess the way the spout works is alright but I prefer the much simpler flexible spout. Had to cut an air vent which I plug with a rubber stopper.
4,"Fascinating ! A ""fishing trip"" to acquire the big stuff.","Hoving takes you inside the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Some stories about how he brought the blockbuster exhibitions to the Met are very interesting. Art lovers will like this book. Some pictures include the work of ancient Cyprus and the art in the Egyptian rooms. He explains the art of toading. This book can get kind of stuffy. Hopefully, everyone is still talking to one another. Everybody should walk the halls of this building and appreciate the acquired works. This is a good place to see if you are visiting and exploring the big town. The author makes you want to go over there."
4,An old favorite,"I first read Making the Mummies Dance over 10 years ago, when I checked it out from the Missoula Public Library. I checked it out again a couple of years ago, and finally decided to buy my own copy. It's a very interesting look into the backend of museums and the art world. The information has been useful, now that I have many friends and web development students in the art world.I especially like the comments Walter Hoving made about his step-mother training him in manners and how that made a difference in his life. Those types of details make this book more than just a dry, factual tome."
5,"Egotistical,but Interesting","This book is a must-read for anyone who is interested in the politics that go on in a world-class museum. Hoving weaves a fascinating tale that makes for the best late night reading. The only problem is that Hoving's ego plays just as big a role in the book as does the famous ""hot pot"" the museum illicitly acquired from Italy. Overall, however, it is an excellent book. If you like this one, you'll also like his book on art forgery, ""False Impressions""."
4,"""Making the Mummies Dance"" by Thomas Hoving","Fascinating account of the stormy years that Dr. Hoving was the Director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. One may not like some of what he did or how it did it as Director, but it was very interesting and he accomplished a great deal for the museum. A great read for those interested in museums, art, etc."
4,"Another layer cake of savory, cross-cultural ingredients","Layered stews in which each apparently starts with a core ingredient and builds the desired mix of flavors one layer at a time. In the finished product, each layer repeatedly rises to prominence through the others, and all undulate together to make all flavors complementary, no matter how different they are. Paolo Conte- and B-52-clones play their characteristic roles. This edition includes Mideast, Balkans, Europop, boulevardier, Latin, African. A calm urgency that sustains tension forever prevails throughout. Each stew suspends its ingredients in this forward driving tension. S: tr 1-Brlé la mèche (a Lo'Jo classic for me now in which the balance is perfect and the sway engulfs you). tr 2-(another classic that highlights the urgency of their music, especially in B-52 choruses). tr 10-À l'embrace des lèvres (perhaps the least characteristic cut-a classic piano boulevardier waltz) [44:20]"
4,Fun for the kids... but...,"Our twin baby girls enjoy this toy and it will keep one of them entertained for a few minutes, which is nice! However, the suction cups aren't that great. Both girls can pull it right off of wherever it's stuck. But this probably would happen no matter what, kids just want to hold things in their laps anyway don't they?My only other complaint is that when I researched the maker, Hape International, I was under the impression they were a European company - and was disappointed when I got the toy and found out it was made in China.Still... the kids love it, it helps their hand/eye coordination and cause/effect skills. Great size for little hands."
4,Good toy for older tots,"I bought this toy for my [...] son but it didnt keep his attention for a long time, now he is 10 months, he is actually moving the things around and like it much more. I think it is a great educational toy and helps to work on their hand/finger control, but for a little bit older tots."
2,Suction cups don't work,"I bought this toy to take with me to restaurants and such to occupy my son when he was around 12 months old. Unfortunately, the suction cups on the bottom don't work. I've even tried wetting them to see if that would help to no avail.Other than that, this toy is pretty durable and sturdy, it just doesn't work at all like I had hoped."
4,Sturdy toy for entertaining,"I figured with four suction cups my daughter wouldn't be able to pull it off of her high chair tray, but she did. She is a determined child! Sometimes she can't pull it off though. She has dropped it on the floor several times and it has held up well. She enjoys it and I'm glad I purchased it."
3,Oregon is on crack,"It is so funny how some reviewers have to try and sound so ""well read"" in order to tell you if the album is good or not. Mr. Oregon is a ""smart"" guy and he is trying to tell you if you don't like underground indie rock don't buy this. That is a lot easier that trying to go on and on and on and on about a review that is meaningless. If you like Steel Pole Bath Tub, Comets on Fire or Fu Manchu, this is up you alley."
4,One of the better overviews!,"Apart from providing a summary of the main web sites, the book includes a focus on many specialized/ niche sites - which doubtlessly provide new ideas and leads for job-seekers. This book is definitely one of the better ones in its category."
5,Thoughtful fun,"With LAND OF THE LOST MAMMOTHS, Mike Davis has created a truly unique combination of rollicking adventure, travelogue and science fact that is sure to appeal to a wide range of young readers and many older ones as well, all of whom will appreciate the wealth of information on subjects ranging from the composition of glaciers to the classification of proboscideans (that's ""mammoths,"" for the uninitiated) to proper kayaking technique, set in a fast-paced narrative with action and cliff-hangers a plenty. MAMMOTHS is also a beautiful book in the physical sense, with a gorgeous cover, elegant illustrations and thick, creamy paper that makes it a pleasure to hold in one's hands and read.A fine effort all around!"
5,works great - easy install,Simple install as it was a direct replacement. Just plugged it in and waited.After reaching cycle temperature it did the first cycle and filled with water. Harvesting ice like crazy now. We were really glad that it was just the ice maker that went bad and not something else in the system.
5,will use these people again,I had barely ordered it and it arrived at front door. Quick service . easyto install and works perfectly a perfect replacement
1,hate this item,Item is very small. Spend a few more dollars and buy something larger. The diffuser oil doesn't last even one month. Then they want $9 per 4 oz. bottle to refill it. So you would have to buy a refill every 3 weeks.
3,"Nothing special, but expensive for what it is","This is just a standard 8"" x 5"" spiral notebook with a cardboard (not plastic) front and rear cover. The covers are not particularly thick and are not suitable for providing a firm writing surface. The writing paper itself is the standard writing tablet paper and is very white. The rule (lines) is 1/4 - 5/16"" wide. I've had the tablet for only 2 days but already this is starting to show signs of wear.Decent, but no big deal and certainly not worth more than $5 in my book."
5,"Beautiful design, excellent quality","I have already got 2 santoku knives from Global. If you like the design, this salad set just fits perfectlx."
1,not impressed,"definately not convenient and their customer service was very poor and unfriendly. Will not do business with them again.weights were not easy to use, I recommend easier dumbbells like bowflex or turbo bells 5-60"
1,not redceived,I can't review since I have not received your prodeuct that I ordered. It was promised between April 6 and April 26 and this is May 8th andno DVD.This is the third time I have notified you:Does anybody hear?Does Anybody care?Is anybody there?h e l l o !!!
5,Must know information,"This book is packed full of must know informatiion for today's dog owners. I have been a dog owner as long as I can remember, my parents breed collies. It seems though dogs have more health issues now. This book was very user friendly and informative. My current dogs seems to have more issues than any before him. This book has given me information to get him healthy and keep him healthy. Thank you thank you"
3,Great Book - Was Missing Pages,This is a great book/story for my Firefighter obsessed boy but there were 10 pages missing from the book and as it was a gift and ordered early (and wrapped) we did not discover this until well after the 30 day return window. So now we have to pay for the return on a book that was defective. Very unhappy.
1,Wish I could return this book,"I stumbled on this book while looking for ""Broken Trust"" after having read a review of that book. After reading the reviews of ""Lost Generations"" I thought I should order both books. What a mistake. I had hoped for a good telling of the Bishop Trust scandal. This is more of a diary of the life of a Hawaiian than any description of that scandal. If you like lots of Hawaiin slice of life stories then you will probably like this book. If you would like to read a coherent description of the Bishop Trust scandal, then look elsewhere."
3,"Some good stuff, but bottom line-""it don't wash","There is some real truth in this book, but not the whole truth. Been there! I have come full circle (stay at home mom, then working mom for a short while and then back home again-working part time from a home office while the children are in school). There are all types of situations, but life is too short to spend it with an employer all day while your children sit at home, in a daycare center or with a babysitter. Mark my word, life will pass you by and then your children will be gone. Too late then! If you have children, stay at home with them while they are home. Be there when they are little, when they come home from school, in the summer. Yes, we love them, but God help us if we can't give them a few short years of our time."
5,Hidden India Kerala Spicelands,"This tape is wonderful!!!! It inspired me to have an Indian themed dinner party to share all the interesting things, revealed in this Video.I've watched it many times."
4,A great introduction to creating community,"This book is a great resource for imagining how a classroom can be so much more than just another classroom. The only thing that I felt was lacking was a solid set of resources to help support the teacher who wishes to adapt the ideas offered by Tribes, such as ""community circles"" in the morning. A great companion website is [...] which offers a quote and question of the day to support community circle discussions to kick off each day."
5,Tribes: It Works,"We are a TRIBES school and this book guides you down the road with activities for helping make your class a cooperative community. It even has energizers. We use them as a brain break, five or so minutes to helps students wake up and get ready for the next activity."
2,Assertiveness DVD Amateurly done,"Information is useful but presented poorly- boring, poor presentation skills. Would not have purchased if i had known how amateurishly it was put together."
3,Caution: Picture is Misleading,"The product is fine, and arrived intact. However, customers should be aware that although the picture depicts a variety of colors (and a much larger package), the text says that the jewel cases are black, which is what arrived."
2,Marrying Mattie,"I bought and read this book because of the great costumer reviews but I was very disappointed. I didn't like Mattie or Ty at all and I tried to. They spent too much time through the whole book moaning their past, OVER and OVER and OVER and OVER, enough already! So what could have been a good book for me, fell very short of the mark."
3,Norell,I like Norell. This smells kinda old. so on.so on and so on. so on.so on and so on. so on.so on and so on.
5,My Favorite Racing Game,"This game is awesome! It has excellent graphics and it lets you change your view to differnt angles. You move very fast and can make sharp turns. It has many tracks you can choose from. Also, it gives you a choice on which car you want to use for a driver. In addition, you can create you own car and driver and race against the pros."
4,BUCKLE UP!!!!,I'm not much of a fan of car racing. In fact I put it in the same catagory as watching a guy hit a golf ball and then walking after it. But.... watching an event and playing an event are two different animals. NASCAR Thunder 2003 is a total rush. I play on a six foot T.V. screen and this game litterally puts you behind the wheel. Every race is pure adrenalin start to finish.Multi player is a total blast. This game is a must purchase. Renting it would be a waste cause you're only gonna end up buying it.
2,Really Awful on Handling Cars!!!,"Nascar Thunder 2003. I bought this game thinking I will have fun,but this game is awful in the ways the cars turn. I don't know if the PS2 version is like this or what. But I do know that the Gamecube version make the cars MAD LOOSE TURNING WITH DEFAULT SETUP. How loose you say WELL STUPID LOOSE!!!!! IT'S LIKE IF YOU DRIVE INTO A CORNER WITHOUT STABLITY CONTROL YOU WILL RAM INTO OTHER CARS OR SPINOUT UNLESS YOU ARE USING THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF BRAKE EVERY TIME,OR ARE A PRO AT THIS GAME. LIKELY I CAN MY RETURN GAME TO GAMESTOP BY THEIR USED RETURN POLICY. I DO NOT KNOW SHOULD I RETURN IT OR NOT YET. Also Daytona and Talladega races are very unrealistic. Watch a Daytona and Talladega on YouTube the cars are always very close to each other during the whole race not all spread out across the track like the days before plate racing."
5,WOW,HOLY COW BATMAN !! What a game it is very good . Everything looks so real . This really brings u inot the fore front of car games .
5,20 e Annibversaire V1 is still one of the greatest records,"I have worn out vinyl volumes of this fantastic record and its partner volume 2. If you are curious about the great Franco and TP OK Jazz this a really good place to start. This is majestic music that contains a warm dance music that is also, somehow, plaintive. It has everything: amazing orchestra mix of voices, horns, guitars and the Fraco wizard on lead guitar. Arrangements to wonder at. My all time Franco song is on this album (i have about 60 other albums)- the track entitled Voyage Na Bandundu. Really can't recommend this enough. Worth selling something else to buy it."
1,You have got to be kidding.,"This stove is unsafe. The flue collar does not fit a standard 6 inch flue. The wood burns so rapidly that the stove warps. I went through a face cord of dry hard wood in 3 days. I had to load wood every 45 minutes. If you use the damper the fire goes out. There is no way to regulate the in take of air. The 65 cfm fan is a joke. The fan blows through a 3' by 6' cut out in the rear sheet metal of the stove. You would get more air flow blowing across the top of the stove. I bought the stove from Northern Tool because I live so close to a store. I returned the stove on the fourth day. I spoke with a salesperson at a fireplace store, and he said the Vogelzanz was no longer allowed at trade shows. I gave this stove one star so that I could warn people about Vogelzang products. (While it has a German sounding name, this stove is actually made in China.)"
4,Inexpensive alternative for Apple laptop,"This worked well with an apple powerbook G4 1.67ghz 15"" laptop. There is no cord management provided, so packing up for the road means wrangling the stiff AC cord and the thin DC cord into your bag. You may want to do what I did, which is give the Tech Fuel charger a permanent residence at a desk and take the original apple charger on the road. If the appearance of your apple laptop is important to you, don't buy this unit because it will win no design awards."
2,Avoid this one...,"The book goes over the basic instructions for installing the software, and basically drops off there. Approx. 170 pages are devoted to the server, the other 360 describe how to develop and structure content. One of my main hopes for the book was to find out what the configuration internals were (the secrets of the obj.conf file for instance) but it does not speak to that. I also was hoping it would discuss what was needed to install a Java Application on the server, but again he discussed how to build an applet and getting it to run on the browser (I thought this was a book about the server... Oops! My mistake). A complete waste of money... There must be better out there... can't get much worse..."
4,david turner,i have always loved the winans in every thing that they do i have owned every cd they have come out with and wear them out they are just nice to listen to
2,You Probably Shouldn't Buy This,"I would not suggest this bag for any musician that has to do any consistent traveling. It is very light, but it offers very little protection. I had to commute on the bus with my tenor and it got broken after 4-5 months."
4,Great Video,"I got this for my husband for Valentines day, We both loved it! We do wish the actual Super Bowl game was on this dvd though. But is had some facts that we did not know which was nice."
4,The coach speaks.,"The video was very informative and funny at times, but it was not what I expected. It's only 42 minutes long and it could of had more scene's from the games throughout the year. The interview with Mike Ditka, Jim McMahon, and Mike Singletary are very informative and had alot of inside information."
3,Sparkly!,"Got these as a birthday present--Love how the ink looks, but find that the writing could be smoother and the grip isn't the most comfortable."
3,OK GUN.....,"This gun isn't the greatest gun but what do you expect for twenty bucks? At first, this gun shot excellent and pretty far.After a while though, the spring gets messed up and it doesn't shoot nearly as far or hard. It's prett realistic though and looks great. If you want a good pistol, get a Beretta with some .20g BBs. This one only uses .12s and they don't even hurt or go far. The only thing heavy about this gun is the mag which holds a decent amount. Good gun.....at first."
1,Apache Rose 1947 Standard,"I was looking forward to viewing this Roy Rogers movie. Unfortunately my DVD player tries to read it and then tells me that this is an ""Incorrect Disc""."
4,Consistent Talent & Creativity,"The music of Backwards Saint, the impressive debut album of Troy Sutton, ranges from the angry rifts of 'dark matter' to the bluesy 'get me out of here.' Through this range, the album maintains a comfortable level of intensity, and the songs connect smoothly, both musically, and thematically. From the first tracks it is clear there are religious undertones at work, and they serve as a driving force to the album's direction. As a whole, Backwards Saint is thick with feeling, sincerity and significance. Sutton's style is distinct, and though every track is boldly colored by his mark, each is unique. Apparently, Sutton's creativity is as consistent as his talent. There aren't any songs on Backwards Saint that don't fit. There isn't any filler. It is obvious that a great deal of thought went into the production of this album; music, lyrics and themes all bear its signature."
5,Great Product,I have owned many of these shakers (same brand and model) and this one is fantastic as well. Ordered this one as mine was stolen off the stage on break (i guess someone else knew how good it was too)One caution is to avoid getting it wet as it will rust the metal bebes inside and it will shoot rust out every time you play it.
5,Great Quality!!!!,"I purchased the item as a gift and one would hate to disappoint someone on any special day. This item delivered!!!!! Great quality, solid, came with all the accessories that were mentioned and shipped in top notch condition. Not only was the ""special person"" who recieved the gift happy, I was just as thrilled to give them an incredible gift. Thank you for the opportunity to do buisness with you, it honestly was a pleasure. Now all they need is a stand for the wonderful instrument!!"
5,GREATEST NASCAR GAME EVER!,"This is one of the best NASCAR games ive ever played. Its got great graphics, sounds, and of course we all like crashes! I added it to my collection and i urge you to do the same. I love the authentic sponsorships and alternate paint schemes. And you can unlock such as numero 3 himself. This is a great game and worth the money."
2,NASCAR Thunder is not fun!!!,"graphics are sloppy, gameplay is corse, the game is not fun, but has some educational value. the game is not fun!!!"
4,It doesn't get any faster than this,"Bravo, EA Sports! This is by far the best auto racing sim out there! The career mode is tough and really makes you work--you're doing well if you can get a handful of top 10 finishes during your rookie season. The multiplayer mode (up to 4 players) is a sure way to kill an entire Saturday with the guys. A must for anyone's collection!"
1,Should not have been published,"This author is downright stupid. He attempts to point out the flaws in Einstein theory. Arguments he used to do that make it clear that the author never understood even Newtonian Mechanics, leave alone Einstein's relativity.I want to give this book zero stars. But one star is the least I am allowed."
3,"Should be titled the ""The Dodgers during the Robinson Era""","This book was good, but not great. My impression was it was about the Dodgers during his time as manager. Few quotes about him from other people. Some discussion about his personal life, but the story centered around baseball during his time. There is even chapters where he is not even mentioned. The book left me with many questions, including, ""How did he supercede the rough Mcgraw Orioles?"". Little discussion on how he arranged his pitching staff, which historically he is given credit for. ""How did develop pitchers?"" Questions like that where never touched, but may have been able to give a better perception of the person he was"
5,lovely rich designs,"Celtic cross stitch is a great investment for knotwork enthusiasts. The projects, which include a floor rug, cushion, and various small items, are quite adaptable. Most designs are based on original pictures in illuminated manuscripts, and are shown in full colour.One of the particularly nice things in this book is a design library, which contains lots of interesting knots to mix and match, and some very good alphabets."
5,Excellent Collection,Much better than the other Celtic cross-stitch I've looked through. Good library of designs - all the clasic knots and animals - and perhaps most important for beginners (and the lazier among us): No half-stitches!
5,"Bette Davis: the trashier, the better","Bette Davis plays another scum-of-the-earth character who this time steals her sister's (Olivia de Haviland's) doctor husband (played by Dennis Morgan), drives him to commit suicide, then tries to steal de Haviland's new male companion (George Brent), who also happens to be an old flame of her own. Inbetween all this Davis carries on incestuously with her degraded uncle (Charles Coburn), and then runs over a young girl, killing her, and blaming it on a young black man (Ernest Anderson). Only Bette Davis could get away with this kind of stuff, and she pulls it off marvelously. The script is tight and top-notch, and the direction by John Huston excellent. There is even a somewhat sympathetic acknowledgement of the raw deal blacks were getting in 1942. There's a wonderful cameo appearance of THE MALTESE FALCON cast, including Bogart, Sidney Greenstreet, and Peter Lorre, in a bar scene, with Walter Huston as the barkeep. Terrific trashy fun."
5,"For an Oldie, its a Goodie","This is a great old movie if you like to watch the bad girl get her comeuppance in the end. Okay, so its melodramatic, but in older movies that's fine with me. Bette Davis plays Stanley, the spoiled, self-absorbed, totally selfish sister to Olivia de Havilland's Roy, the good-hearted, long-suffering sister.I asked my elderly mother if she had ever seen this movie and when she said she had not, I told her she should watch it. Bette Davis is so bad in this movie. As soon as it ended my mother said thoughtfully, ""You know, there really are people like that."" I had to agree with her.Olivia de Havilland is much prettier than Bette Davis, but Davis was famous for playing spit-fires and drama queens. And de Havilland had played Melanie Wilkes in ""Gone With The Wind"" only a few years before this film, so it was easy casting.Husband stealing, suicide, manslaughter, false accusations, its all here."
1,In This Our Life,I ordered this movie on DVD from two (2) different suppliers and had to return both of them. These DVD's Have a manufacturing defect and all stop and freeze at the same point.
3,Book is a lttle on the light side of the topic,The book is only 30 pages so don't expect too much detail. Mostly illustrated with drawings - few pictures except for the info on replacing a saw handle.
1,No Help,"This is not a sturdy boot brush. Even the most helpful review here points out that in order to clean a pair of boots, one needs to either remove them and brush them with a hand brush or have an assistant use a hand brush.The product itself is constructed of very thin metal. It might be suitable for loose grass clippings, but here in Virginia we have a type of soil that is a red clay. There is no way this brush helps, as any significant effort to rub against it will simply bend it.The brushes themselves are also very weak. Overall, there is no value to this product. I purchased two of them, made a solid effort to use them by mounting them on pallets at my job site, then discarded them as simply of no value.I'm looking forward to finding a product that will remove more than grass clippings, but feel that the amazon.com process is not adequate. The reviews here were overly positive, and an examination of the actual product is needed to make an informed decision."
2,Soon to be outdated,"Written almost as a children's book for the parents, the content of this book is simplistic, centered around a do-it-yourself guide for a few tools, toys and games. If you're looking for a scientifically based, nature-as-therapy type of resource, this is not it. Nor should this be used for public areas, due to its home-built nature. It may be a good primer for those completely unfamiliar with the concepts, but overall there are much better texts available"
5,"ANYONE THAT DOESN'T LIKE THIS BOOK, LACKS A SENSE OF HUMOR!","This book is totally what society needs right now! IT IS A LAUGH OUT LOUD IN PUBLIC type of book. Aisha makes some serious points about real life situation, and gives real life opinions on how one ""could"" handle them. And every real issue doesn't have to have a ""really"" serious after responce. But some people are to serious about life and they fall victim to things they just really have no controll over. So those people need another way of looking at life, a comedic view of the world.But most of all, persons reading this book have to take it as it is, A DANG GOOD TIME! It's not ""Origins of Species"" by: Charles Darwin. It's not suppose to change the literary world. It is what it is. Humor in it's most intelligent form. And it doesn't hurt that it's coming from a sophisticated young black woman either. ;)"
1,Waste of Money,This book was stupid! It seems thrown together just for the sake of writing a book. Don't waste your money.
2,for fans only,"I can't figure this book out. It's a collection of essays but none of them seems to have a point. It's like talking to a friend whom you like but she bores you to tears. There is nothing fresh, intresting or thought provoking here. It's just a celebrity mouthing some well worn platitudes."
1,Swerve...and CRASH!,"I did not feel this book at all. I should have known something was up in the opening pages when she recounts the difficulty she had explaining to others exactly what type of book she was working on. It had no point! She said herself she is no expert and this was not a self-help book. Then why the hell did she write it? To kill time? Pure boredom? I have better ways to waste my time than to sit and read about how Aisha Tyler views today's society. I mean, who is she anyway? She's described as humorous, a comedienne. But what she thought of as witty I found incredibly corny. I just didn't get it."
1,I think Crash & Burn would've been more appropriate...,"On page 28 of this ""book"" Aisha informs us all of her utter disdain for reality dating shows and their ilk. However, someone needs to inform her that there's a woman who looks just like her and is using her name hosting a reality dating show called the Fifth Wheel. I guess she needs to do something to supplement her income because she won't make a dime off this book. It was beyond terrible and the only reason I rated it one star is because they won't allow you to give book negative stars. Please avoid this one or at least read it in the store and buy something worth your time and money..."
2,Disappointing,"I love Aisha Tyler. She is the funniest woman in showbiz! But, this book lacks depth. I could not wait to read this book. I am a late sleeper, and I watched Aisha on KUSI Channel 9 in San Diego in anticipation of her book! But it is not worthy of the genius bookwriters out there who deserve there credits. She bored me with her over annalyzing of everything. From a strong woman's stance, it made me feel like someone was telling how I shoud be cool. Aisha you are a intelligent and comical person. Please be less judgemental on the next book, and just let things flow. Love ya, Tamara"
5,Now this is what I am talking about...One of the TCP books yet,"All I can say is You Go Gurl.... Wonderful, Wonderful, Wonderful... Words cannot describe how much I enjoyed these two books (Flip side of the game and Game over) And yes I have to agree, you have to read both books. Can I tell you I have read both books in 3 days like everyone else I could not put the book down. So please don't miss out on a excellent read because with both books you get it all, from laughing to crying, etc... I even had my husband cracking up with me when I would read him some parts out of the book. On the real, Ms. Whitaker I truly enjoyed your books and I hope to read more of them in the coming future. May God continue to bless you, you truly have a gift. On the real both of these books are the 2 of the best TCP books I have read."
3,NOT great BUT NOT horrible,"OK SO THIS BOOK TOOK ME ABOUT A WEEK TO READ ON AND OFF, IT DEF WAS NOT GREAT, BUT IT WASNT HORRIABLE NEITHER, THEIR WAS SOME TWISTS AND THINGS THAT I DIDNT SEE COMING, BUT OVER ALL THE STORY WAS JUST AVERAGE. THE WRITER WROTE THE BOOK REALLY WELL AND IM SURE ALOT OF PEOPLE CAN RELATE TO THIS STORY_ THOSE WHO CAN RELATE WOULD PROBABLY ENJOY THE BOOK MORE, SINCE IT HITS HOME. BUT OVERALL I WOULDNT SAY IT WAS GREAT OR BAD- I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BOOK, BUT TO PEOPLE I THINK WHO WOULD ENJOY IT, NOT TO EVERYONE, BECAUSE FOR ME, IT WASNT A MUST READ."
3,Emotional,This is a good book. The issued she had with her mother was crazy but I could relate. Good Read.............
4,Too Real,I just finished this book 12 this morning and it was truly a delight. The characters were so real and Taj was very patient with Vera. I don't know too many dudes who would have put up with her for so long. This was definitely a good read and I look forward to future novels from Tu-Shonda. Job well done!
1,Game is Totally Over,After reading the First book Flip Side of the Game I felt I would give the author another try and read Game Over. Honestly The book was not good at all and the characters were totally unrealistic. Even after reading both books I was still unable to picture the characters. The book had too much materialistic name dropping and people do not actually think about what designer they are putting on their backs or feet each time the get dressed. In addition the characters actions were much too immature for her to be in her early thirties. I definetly found this book a hard read because the characters were unbelievable. I let the first book ride but to continue the same lame story is just too much
1,uninformative,"The book is easy to read, however, the information does not feature the theoretical clarity and depth of a real engineering text. The content is interesting, however, there is zero chance of it turning you from an also-ran into a champion.Uninformative."
1,Inside Racing Technology,"Over simplistic, out-dated and lacking sufficient relevance to anyone except the uneducated and the inexperienced.Deeply dissapointing in many respects."
2,Daniel O'Donnell - Christmas With Daniel,"The music was traditional Christmas and vintage Daniel. The description on site stated October 2003 but in fact was a ""repackaging"" of his DVD from 1996 (not indicated in product information). Scenery is beautiful, the action is fast paced, and that is to be expected from a much younger Daniel. His Christmas CD is a better buy."
1,Daniel O'donnell,Daniel O'Donnel Christmas with Daniel I can't review this as it either came cracked or I cracked it taking it out I was looking forward to seeing it.
2,Its colorful anyway. . .,"This book has very colorful illustrations and some interesting bits of information, but the book is large for the for the number of knots covered and does have some misleading or wrong illustrations."
5,"THE ORIGINAL ""MOST HAPPY FELLOW""","WONDER FUL MOVIE THAT INSPIRED THE BROADWAY MUSICAL,""MOST HAPPY FELLOW""I WOULD LOVE A COPY OF THIS. I SAW IT ONCE ON A TV CHANNEL BACK IN THE '50'S"
1,Very disappointing,"After being a Mission fan for years, I was very disappointed with this rubbish. The boys should not have got back together. It's formula rock, nothing interesting. Go back and listen to Carved In Sand for some real music by this once great band."
3,"Good to Download, Better to Borrow, Maybe Buy","This Cd is alright. Its cool if you have a friend who owns it so you can at least hear the tracks. Some of the remix's are really good. The Fuzzy Logic Remix is a definate party starter, there is no question about that. But if you don't want to spend the money on this cd, download the tracks. Even though they are the same song, just remixed, the remixes are overall good. The Hail Sagan is a nice little Intermission from the tracks and is really intersting to listen to. It sounds alot like BS2000 rather than the Beastie's Normal intrumentals."
1,its not worth the price,alright...im like the b boys number 1 fan and 4 19 dollas this cd is not worth it....its just intergalactic 3 times...and is pretty annoying...take myword...its real badd!!!!
3,Decent product,"Fulfill its purpose but clearly has the looks of something made cheaply which makes your gift look less valuable, so decent product."
2,Look elsewhere . . . .,"I considered these poor quality and felt and looked cheap. Not something I wanted to use as gift packaging. So they have gone back, at a $6 cost to me, and I am still looking for a good quality gift box. Save your money."
1,No chance to review!!,"My review, well if we would have had a chance to use this piece of equipment maybe I would have a reveiw! When I brought this home to wrap for my kids from SANTA I took the two controllers out of the package to wrap separately and the cords on the controllers were fried ""literally"" some one had packaged these already destroyed! The outer package was all in tack but the inner package revealed that someone had knowingly packaged these controllers like this! Unbelievable!"
1,dual shock controller,the Blue dual shock controller work on everything except you can not enter cheat codes with it
3,Sticky sticks,"Not much to say about this controller...it's blue so it looks cool, but I bought mine used and the left analog stick is ""sticky"" as in it gets stuck very slightly in one direction. Put a little silicone lubricant in there, which helped but didn't completely fix it. My original controller that came with my PS2 isn't doing that so I don't really understand why this one is."
5,SONY controller,"The price on the SONY controller here at Amazon, was the best I found at the time I was shopping for replacemnet ones. The OEM controllers are still by far the best made and most durable in the opinion of myself and my son, for whom I bought them for. I have tried other brand controllers over the years. And yes they work, just not as well nor near as long."
4,Sony solid,"A rock-solid no-frills controller from Sony with only the basic features. The plastic is of good quality and feels durable.I've had mines for almost a year now. With only moderate usage, my controller is still at peak performance.If you need an extra controller but don't care for any extra features, then you can't go wrong with this one."
1,A must have for your system !,"The official PS2 controller is what you need in case the one that came with the syetem breaks , its a good idea to have 2 controllers for one person just in case !"
2,might want to skip,"I was never a fan of the Playstation 2 controller. I don't like the fact that the analog stick replaced the directional pad. Using an analog stick is annoying because you don't feel comfortable with it. Ask any older gamer- they will tell you that you felt more in control of your movements with a directional pad. With an analog stick, you slide all over the place. In addition to that disaster, the PS2 controller also suffers from ""too many buttons"". We shouldn't have to have a degree in rocket science to figure out how to successfully figure out and complete a game. The Playstation One had the best controller ever. It was comfortable, you were always in complete control, and it just looked better."
5,Ignorance is not always bliss...,"This is the official Sony Dual Shock, they've just released it in three new colors (Blue, Slate Grey and Green) ... One of the previous reviewers lambasted it and said get a Sony one, so I'm evening up the score some."
4,Backslash..,"I hate to break it to you, but I highly disbelieve that the PS2 controllers are comfortable. Yes, I own a PS2, and a Gamecube, myself, but the Gamecube is a lot more comfortable. However, the PS2 is a lot more durable, and should I say, a lot less &amp;quot;sticky.&amp;quot;"
1,poor quality dualshock 2,"they was this controller was discribed was not in the condition as stated. The color was very faded and scratched up, the pads on the joy stick had extreme wear and holes in it. Look like a garage safe reject. If this is the quality they sell then they have lost me as a customer."
4,Takes alot of abuse!,"This controler can take the abuse. I have thrown it, bounced it off the floor and furnature. All I have had to do was pop buttons back in. After all that it still works great"
4,Still current after all these years,"This ia a very good presentation of the case for legalizing marijuana for medical use. Even though it was made before proposition 215 was passed in California, it remains relevant. It features interviews with several people who use marijuana for medical purposes and one of the leading advocates for the legalization of marijuana, the late Mary Jane Rathun better known as ""Brownie Mary""."
1,leaked water all over,Wish I could return this but the diverter broke when my husband was trying to screw it to the shower head to prevent leaks there. Made of cheap plastic. Water leaked not only from the showerhead connection but also from the handheld piece. Very unhappy with this purchase. My money just whent down the drain on this purchase.
5,LOVE this product!!,"Whenever I start a new job, this is the first thing I order for my desk. This is not just your ordinary pen holder. It has three drawers for all the little things - push pins, staples, paper clips, binder clips or whatever you want to store in these drawers. It's amazing and I always feel so organized when I am at work."
1,More a nightmare than a dream,"After reading the carefully researched biography by A. Bundles, this one seems contrived and patronizing. The emphasis is more on the author's speculation than on the facts of Walker's life."
4,Cute.,This book has no story. It's just an introduction of the animals(pets).It's still cute and great for young kids.
2,Weary of the occult sneaking into unsuspecting books.,"The author includes great ideas in which to use olive oil in every day life, but tends to wander a great deal in her thoughts, which I found rather distracting.I grew very tired of the occult references and had I known that they were in the book, I would not have purchased it."
3,all pieces did not come,"The wall plug did not arrive with the base and car charger. Also, the picture does not match the actual item. Fast shipping and it works, although only with the car charger. would like to give 5 stars but cannot, will change if I can after receiving the wall charger cable."
4,Dischordant and captivating.,"This is an album that will hit you afterwords - when you've turned it off and left the building, the sounds will creep back into your head. This album is very different from the earlier ""midnight cowboys..."" (the lesser of the two available on cd) - less ROCK, more complex layering and compositions (with a little of that ROCK stuff). Recommended for someone looking for something new."
2,Not the best scope out there,"If this scope works for you out of the box, then it might be a good fit. HOWEVER, the dioptic adjustment is accomplished by rotating the end of the scope closest to your eye. This is not necessarily a problem, but if you need to make an adjustment for corrected vision (like myself), I found that when adjusted, the flip open cap now flipped downward (towards the weapon it was to be mounted on) and I could find no way to reset the flip open cap... not the most ideal situation. There is no parallax adjustment on this scope, what it comes with is what you get. The included rings seemed excellent and the lighted optics worked fine, but I found the scope unusable because of flip open caps rotating and no parallax adjustment. I should add the entire scope is coated in ruggedized rubber coating... on the wrong gun, it would look horribly silly."
2,UTG 3x9x40 Illum Scope,"this scope & rings are not 1"" it is 30mm. the scope is big & bulky as compared to similar scopes. UTG 3-9x40 F.S. Rubber Armored Mil-Dot RGB Scope with Weaver Rings"
5,Very good deal,This scope was very affordable and it did the job of the more expensive scopes.My rifle has a Houge stock so it matches the scope. I'm going to get another one forMy ar-15.
4,Great for price; questionable lens cap design,"As other reviewers have stated, this appears to be a nice scope for the price. Available cheaper without reticle illumination, but for another few bucks, worth the extra feature. Comes with 2 batteries. The highest illumination settings seem to make the reticle fuzzy, so the lower settings work better for me. One potential issue that others have not commented on is the design of the lens caps. It's a great feature to include lens caps with a scope as it saves the user from having to purchase them after the fact, increasing the cost for the scope. In this case, however, the hinge for the lens cap is integrated into the body of the scope, so that a damaged cap cannot be easily replaced. I'm only knocking off 1 star for this drawback, as a broken cap would presumably be covered by the lifetime warranty."
2,30-30 grade,"Match this with your 30-30 lever action and harvest, Tactically almost useless. Don't have time to list all it can't do, but out to 150 yards it will do!"
2,Alright,"I should have know for the money what I was getting,but a fair scope for the price,good for what I was doing with it..now for sale;),always Glenn"
4,WoW!,"Pretty nice scope the illuminations turn green/red but the green takes up more battery power.The whole thing is covered in rubber so its more durable.The only reason I gave it 4 stars, is because the rings that came with it were not the right ones for my scope. But overall its a great scope!"
3,Check out Phat Kat,"Phat Kat is a rapper who is well known in the Detroit area. This big guy is also known as Ronnie Cash. His album Undeniable is pretty hot. The first song on the album ""It's A Wrap"" sets the pace for the album. The beats on this album are synthezer and electronic sounding at times. Ronnie Cash is on a mission to change the game. He talks about a lot of the same thing as other rappers-his turf (313), women (hoes), money, and how he is going to change the game. The Undeniable also features appearances from other Barak Records artist Dwele and Slum Village. Phat Kat also has a cut on his album with the original Michigan rapper-MC Breed himself. Stand out cuts on this album include ""Shake, Shake, Shake,"" and ""True Story."" With more advanced production I can see Phat Kat going far in the game."
1,Click the back button... NOW,"I bought this item, thinking it was a dream come true. I've never played ps2 wirelessly before. But this controller had major functionality problems. say you are running your character around with the left analog stick... every 5 seconds he ran the opposite way i pointed him to. Yeah, I dont want to majorly present this item as a fraud, but i would definitely suggest you find another version of the ps2 wireless controller."
5,Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit 2 Rocks!,"This game rocks. Most of my favorite cars are in this game.Ford Mustang SVT Cobra. Lamborghini Diablo.FerrariF50.MclarenF1/F1LM. Just a few cars of the bunch to name. This game is really fun, as it lets you blow away the cops away. You get toreally put the pedal to the medal, and if you have a racing wheel then this is like an awesome arcade game, except with infinite credits. The cars are REALLY fast, and there's many ways to play. if you are angry at the game, then put it on single race, put the opponent on a slow car such as a Lotus Elise , and be a Diablo and lap them 'many times as you want.All in all I generally don't like racing games, this one changed my thoughtsforever,though paitince is a BIG virtue in this game. WARNING:IN REAL LIFE DO NOT, I REPEAT DO NOT, TRY ANY OF THIS STUFFTHAT'S DONE ON THE GAME AS YOU WILL PROBABLY GET KILLED, OR YOURLICENCE/PERMIT SUSPENDED/ TAKEN AWAY."
5,what to buy,"this game rocks! but before you go buying every car you see heres a few tips for you1.you shouldnt keep using all the starting cars until you get a mclarenF1(fastest car in the world).the most essential cars are the 10,00 dollar FERRARI 360 SPYDER,DODGE VIPER GTS,and CORVETTE Z06.THE GOOD WAY TO MAKE MONEY IS SINGLE RACE THE HIGHER THE ABILITY LEVEL THE MORE MONEY YOU GET.ALSO HALF OF THE SPECIFACATIONS ARE WRONG!OVERALL THIS GAME IS ....GOOD"
4,It could have been a little better,"The main reason why I say this is because the cars didn't handle very well, you'd be flying down the road just blowning by the dude in second (sound familar) and then comes this blindside curve and you go careening into the side and lose your lead. The only way to prevent that is if you brake beforehand (like 50 meters) and still have trouble around the turn. Another negative thing is the speed. You'd be going 200 km/h and it'd be looking like you're going 100 km/h. On the good side the hot pursuit mode is very fun and full of action. Championship mode is hard at times but other than that it's fun:)"
4,A good racing game but not up to NEED FOR SPEED quality,"This is probably the best racing game out for gamecube right now, but it's nothing like the other need for speed games. First of all, its missing three essential items that made NEED FOR SPEED games famous; damage, in car view, and the whole race-get-money-buy-car-repair-car-sell-car setup. This is a great game but dont expect anything as good as the first."
4,need for speed rox!,"this is a pretty cool game, but if you get bored easily...dont buy it. i bought a steering wheel for it so it makes the game more interesting...the normal controller made it boring... rent it first thats what i did!!"
1,THE WORST GAME EVER,"If there ever was a game that makes you want to die, this is this game. The game is horribly unrealistic and unfair. The police always go after you and never the opponents. You would have a much better time playing with a remote control car that has a dead battery. The moment I got rid of this game everything in my life started going better. I won the lottery, Jennifer Lopez fell in love with me, and I was elected to president. So, if you want this game, there is no hope for you."
4,CAUTION: CURVES AHEAD!! :),ok - lets get the reasons i gave it only 4 stars out of the way:- you can't play two player with one as the cop and the other as the racer (this drawback is why the 4 stars really)- after unlocking cars the game sometimes dosen't leave them unlocked- crashes and bangups do not damage your car very muchnow for why its a great game:- the action is pretty real- the handling of the cars is pretty real as well and small things like going over a wooden bridge and driving on brick roads gives 'rumble' feedback (in variable according to how 'rough' the road is of course)- its an actual challenge- tons of maps and tons of really awesome cars- being the cop is really fun!- getting away from the cops is REALLY satisfying :D- no two cars are alikeall in all this was definitly a great buy and worth every penny for the avid car racing game enthusiast.
4,This game is awesome.,"This is one of the best racing games I have ever played. You get run from the police using lots of cars that all handle differently. Police try to stop you with speed strips, helicopters, and ramming you off the road. You also get a chance to be the police and try to stop other drivers. This game offers a chance to drive high end sports cars from Mustangs to Ferrais. There is also this really cool feature where the game automatically does a slow motion close up when your car catches air. This game provides hours of fun."
4,Best Sports Car Racing Game Ever!!!,At first i was a lil skeptical i mean my bro is the one who likes racing games and he is a hard core nfs fan he got his licsence plate NEED4SPD any way this game at first i thought didnt compare to my newly bought game ghost recon but after i beat that need 4 speed was just layin there and one thing led to another and i called in sik for work the next day then stayed up til 2 am beatin the hot pursuit events which by the way werent that hard at all jus time consuming all in all this is a must by for all peeps who know how to appreciate a well desighned game such as need 4 speed hot pursuit 2
3,Different from the PS2 version,"I bought it because I tought it would be the same as the PS2 Version. Well, I was wrong, the GC and the X Box versions are different (or incomplete) from the PS2's which is to me the best one. It's a matter of opinion after all but it's something I wish I had known before."
4,Good for me but not for my dad.,"I like this game a lot but,my dad dosn't really like this game.He dosn't like it because he dosn't like when the cops crash him.My favorite car is the F1 mclaren NFS."
4,A Time to Kill Review,"This book is one of the better Star Trek books I have read and would recommend it. The book starts in Commander Rikers quarters as he is thinking over the events that have shamed the Enterprise and its captain. When Picard is given an assignment to reesablish honor, obstacles form."
5,My Child Loves This Band!,"I was looking to see if the Sunny Side UP Band was ready to release a new CD yet. It's been too long and my family and friends are ready to add to the collection. My daughter is five years old and knows all of the songs on the two CD's and their first release which is now out as a CD too! I think the band members are very talented musicians and each of them bring such diversity to the group! Pam, the lead singer, is fabulous with engaging children into singing the songs. ""Ants in my Pants"" is simply hilarious!!! I can just picture the ""grandma swinging and swaying at the picnic trying to get the ants out of her pants! ""My dad's got Trucks"" is soooo cute, I wish I had a little boy who liked trucks cause I know they all get into it. The title song for this CD ""Let's Share It"" sends such a wonderful message to children about sharing with one another. All of the CD's have great messages. I give it a thumbs up all the way....Come on BAND!!! MORE MUSIC!"
5,RECOMMENDED,"This is great music! I love it just as much as my daughter does. We got it as a gift and now have bought several to give to other families and daycare. And they all love it. My daughter's teacher said the class listens to the CD everyday. The kids dance, sing and laugh especially about the purple underwear in the ants in my pants song. You won't go wrong with this CD. The music, the singing, the songs, the words are all first rate and have lots of kid appeal. We recommend, and would give it ten stars if we could!"
4,Love It,"""No Ordinary Love"" was the first track I heard and I loved it. then I hear ""Should Have Never"". After hearing thos songs, I had to get the album. Her voice exudes what she is feeling. i love the album and I encourage all reggae and R&B heads to cop it"
5,Love her and her music!,"If you're a reggae fan, I can assure you that you'll love this CD. I searched high and low for her album in local music stores and noone had it. I turned to Amazon and picked up this CD from a vendor in Japan. I play this CD is regular rotation and always ask by friends and family who she is when they hear her singing. I just wish she would come out with more music.Love me some Alaine!Cheers!"
4,Good.,"Works very well. I bought it for my boyfriend because I think I broke his other 3 year old controller, but I'm the one using it. Works better than the black one he got with the PS2 in my opinion."
4,Great Controller but not so great cord design,"The Sony DualShock 2 Controller is the ultimate controller for the PS2, the imitation ones just don't stand up next the the Sony Dualshock 2. I have had an excellent experience with my Sony Dualshock 2 experience. My controller had stopped working after about a three years, I took the controller apart, and re-arranged the button pads on the front of the conrol board, and it works perfect once again.The only real problem i've had with the dualshocks is the cord is too thin, and tends to break, and expose wiring. I hope this LONG-WINDED review helps, to the rest, well..... God Help You All!!!"
1,Better luck next time.,I had to send two controllers back because the L2 button would stick when playing. Maybe it was my bad luck. Hopefully the cordless controller I ordered will work fine. I'm glad I ordered though Amazon beecause they were great as far as dealing with the returns.

2,Works OK,"I can't really smell, but everyone who has been around me as said it smelled terrible. Smells like ammonia is the answer i usually got. i then tried putting it on, then putting on some of my good colonge and it didnt help any. Only one girl thought it smelled nice... she thought it smelled like vanilla. All others... list of about 20+ said it smelled bad. I am going to return it for my money back. You can give it a try... 1/20 are the odds i got, not good enough for me to spend $40 on."
1,Don't Buy It... !!!,"Don't buy it, it doesn't work. It smells utterly disgusting, even at half the recommended dose, even masked with my own cologne. I had three female friends smell it on me and they said the smell was sickening, one of them almost puked.So if your intention is to sicken the women around you, go ahead, otherwise save your money."
2,Same as my other review from Pherone,"Yes I bought the stuff, thought it would help my wife and I sex life. I tried it without telling her. No response. like another poster I did exactly what was said, used it for a while, but no results. Okay, some people say it works for them, for me it didn't. My biggest problem is getting them to honor the 30 day money back guarantee. I have sent this and another lighter version back and I have yet to hear from them or get a refund. I believe it's a big fraud and I can't believe Amazon would allow a company with business ethics which sucks do business on their site. I am highly disgusted and have ended my purchasing through Amazon cause they have done nothing about it. Can't buy through Amazon any more cause I feel you led me to this fraudulent company and now I can't get my money back."
1,fooled again,I tried it in all the ways according to instructions it does not work at all. I also tried different environments and weather conditions.
1,Very bad odor,This product Smells really really bad I cant stand the odor so I just used it one time and thats it.(just personal experience)
1,Does not work at all.,"I work at a supermarket in Westlake Village. For two days I was using it and it does not work. The women either turn away or ignore me. This is worst than a Dear John letter on a swingers night in Hollywood. My advice for single desperate batchelors, don't buy that stuff. It will turn you into a loser.MarcusWestlake VillagePherone Formula M-11 Pheromone Cologne for Men to Attract Women, with 5mg of Human Pheromones"
3,M2M Pheromone,A good product. Have not had enough time to fully test it - looking forward to trying it out a the next gathering!
1,Does Nothing,"My wife once told me, that a dude in her office once was wearing a pheromone cologne. And that for some reason she was incredibly turned on. Now she had no idea why or what the cologne was...and apparently the guy wasn't all that good looking.In recent years after the birth of our son, my wife's sex drive has all but gone. In hopes of kindling something I ordered this M-11. It does nothing. Nothing for my wife, nothing to anyone I am around...just nothing. Bunch of bull if you ask me. Waste of time and money."
1,This really is a waste of money,"The other negative reviews are quite accurate. I'm sure Mr. Ocheltree is a talented guy with a grand history in the business, but this DVD is worthless. Unless you want to hear mutual admiration ""interviews"" with 5-10 people he knows from the ""old days"", or watch a couple of average drummers play two drum sets (one being Bonham's green sparkle kit)for reasons completely unknown (what does this have to do with tuning or drum tech issues?), this DVD contains no usable information. Nothing. Well, OK, he shows how to place felt strips to muffle a bass drum head, but who (now days) would want to do that who doesn't already know how? Tuning? On the entire DVD the tuning advice sums up to ""tune the bottom heads real tight"". That's it. I was very dissapointed with this DVD. There is just no information, period. I'd be embarrased to have my name on it."
2,Waste of Money,"Unless you like hearing a bunch of people talking about how great Jeff is, don't bother. It's almost like he died and people are talking about him at his funeral. I bought this video specifically for the footage of John Bonham's kit being played. It amounts to less than 10 minutes on this video. I don't care about the drummer from Tool. John Molo plays for a bit and that's kind of interesting, but you can probably find all of the interesting parts of this video you want to see on Youtube. Save your money."
2,Regrettably unhelpful,"I rarely provide negative feedback but this video was particularly disappointing. I find no usable new information here at all as it applies to me. At best it catalogs the head types, shell depths and cymbals of a few drummers, but it does not teach you how to tune a drum. He says over and over that there ""is no science to tuning, it's an art form"", and to use your ears to tune -what does that mean? You're the expert, teach me something! I am disapointed because Jeff could be such a huge resource but instead this video turns into an undisciplined hodgepodge of babble and short, pointless clips. My guess is that he doesn't want to give away any secrets of the industry. Self congratulatory, this should be a call to revise this video into something more helpful."
3,So so,"So superficially. Great purchase for Bonham fans like me, a little bit to add for non-Bonham fans drummers."
2,Disappointing with lack of info,"I got this DVD thinking I'd learn a lot of technical stuff about Drum Techs and it turns out its more like a DVD created to praise Jeff Ocheltree. I'm not saying hes not good enough, but I'm just saying if you ask me what I learnt from this DVD, I'd say practically nothing, conceptually a littly.Don't bother with this DVD unless you're a fan of Jeff the man and just want to see him speak and hear people praise him while he quickly tunes stuff and barely explains exactly what he's doing..."
3,Drum tuning kindergarten,"I hate to say this but, it seems that 99.999% of drummers are retarded when it comes to drum tuning. I know, I couldn't possibly be talking about YOU - the genius who in an attempt to create that B*I*G ""Bonham"" sound bought ""whatever"" drums were the best deal at the time, put the thickest heads available, tuned them loose to get rid of the TONE(eeew yuck gross!), then further dampend them with ""O"" rings, tape, moongel and pillows to kill whatever posibilities existed for the drum to even have any TONE, then proceed to hit them like a 12 year old girl... do any of these things sound familiar to you? Then yes DUMB@$$, I'm talking to YOU - YOU need to buy this video! Then buy Bob Gatzen's video, then take some lessons on how to HIT those things!!!"
1,Language used not appropriate for young kids...,"Despite the fact that my 3 year old loved this, I was appalled at the use of mean words, especially the word ""jerk"", in this DVD. It has been taken away, never to be watched again. I agree with one of the other reviewers, what were the creators of this, otherwise cute DVD, thinking with that language? Parents beware!"
2,Rainbow Fish - Fintastic Fun in Neptune Bay,"I agree with the previous review (about the language that is used), I got this DVD for my 4 year old son, who loves it but...although the stories are very cute and clever, the language that is used is a bit odd for a young childrens video, such as mean naming calling to others and using other offensive language (for small kids) like 'jerk' and more. Overall the stories are nice and well put together, I just wish they could find other words to use inplace of the harsher words they've chosen, especially when your child wants to watch it over and over again!!"
4,A Good Introduction,"This book combines readability with good content, being one of the most often selected introductions to logic and critical thinking on the university level, it obviously holds a great deal of merit."
5,Great Seller!,My book got to me very quickly and was in the condition specified. I would definately buy from this seller again! Also had the best price anywhere!
3,Needs Help,"I think this book has been watered down so many times simply because the author's ran out of words to write. They have split the meanings so many times that there is now no clear definition. Every expample that they use is also from a very liberal slat, it's no wonder since they are from Chico State. By the way this is call not just an ad hominem but a personal attack ad hominem or in plain speak...an insult!"
5,Very well written,Very well written and easy to understand. The author doesn't go over your head with abstract concepts for his peers. It is very broken down and helpful.
2,Not as expected,"I just got this unit 4 days ago for my home office. The dual exhaust tubes are huge - looks like 6"" diameter... not very attractive going from unit to window. My office is 12x13 so I assumed a 1200 BTU would cool it down fast. Wrong. It will cool the room but so far I have not been able to get room temp under 76 degrees... room is comfortable but if it can not cool a small room to 72 forget a large room. Noise level is loud but bearable. I can still talk on phone without distraction. Manual is terrible. Does not explain what each function does. I never understand why a company can not write a good manual. Ion? Auto? and the symbols on unit are not intuitive. I couldn't figure out window adjusters - so I have a 4"" space on my casement window I need to block off. I will probably return and get a window unit."
5,"Just Jane makes ""the Revolution"" real","I really enjoyed Just Jane because it told me not only about what happened to an American soldier during the Revolution (Brandon), but about what happened to people in his family who were only trying to say alive and not get involved (Jane, Simon, and many others). Both English people living in the colonies, as well as Americans, who had at one time gotten along and been family and friends, were forced to take sides. Because of that it was really more like a civil war. It makes the story very exciting and suspenseful, since people never knew which side their friends or family would wind up choosing (or being forced to choose), and they never knew what their enemies would do to them if the enemies wound up getting into power. I really recommend it for anyone 12 or over, girls or boys."
4,Overall a Good Fictional Look at History,"At the start of this novel, Jane steps off the boat from Britain into an America where tensions are escalating between the Colonists and Loyalists. She is young but logical in her feelings and remains so throughout the novel, making the book's biggest flaw not allowing her to become a dynamic protagonist. A large cast of (sometimes confusing) characters surround her and are interesting. The historical facts sometimes felt as if they had been dropped in for the sake of proving it had been well-researched. Still a fast and captivating read, even for those who may not like historical fiction."
1,Is it old?,"I don't know if the bottle I received is old, or got too hot or something? I'm willing to give it the benifit of the doubt. But it doesn not smell good at all. I buy plenty of unsented things,I am used to natural moisturizers and lotions with no fragrance or perfumes added. But this down right stinks. Who wants to smell like a bunch of old musty books or a nursing home? Right? Those are the images that come to mind when I smell it. I guess it calmed my skin and moisturized my skin. But this is going in the trash - major waste of money for me. I just can't get past the yucky odor.Also, I am not convinced that this does anything better than many skin moisturizers on the market today. There isn't anything to suggest that it does, based on the ingredients listed. I think there are better products out there and I will use those."
3,gigi post epilation lotion,"worked ok if you could get past the smell, Obviosly I could not it was greasy and the smell was more than I could handle as I am sensitive to strong odors."
2,"Buy the Playstation 2 version, or forget about it","Since I have always been a fan of the Need for Speed series since its inception on the 3DO system, I bought the XBOX version of this game the day it came out, I thought it would have to be better than the PS2 version, right? Wrong. Despite the obvious lack of PlayStation 2 technical capability, the PS2 version is actually much, much better. The XBOX version plays like a beta of the PS2 version. It has several mistakes I noticed right away (incorrect statistics, cars driving on the left side of the road in US locales, etc), and the bottom line is, the XBOX one isn't fast or fun and the PS2 one is. Luckily, they took back my XBOX version and gave me a PS2 version. And, BTW, only the PC version will have online play, unfortunately."
4,Doesnt get any better,"Well, yea the game isnt out yet. But hey with a car line up like this, how can it be bad? Lambo's Ferraris, Mercedes, and, of course, the king of all supercars - McLaren. Throw in amazing graphics and the best arcade racing ever seen and you have a winner. I don't know about you, but this game is a must-buy to me."
1,Terrible steering and control,"If you like realistic handling and steering ability, you should avoid this game. If you like sliding all over the road and sloppy steering controls, then go for it. Personally, I'd recommend that you just save your money for Project Gotham 2."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! this game is horrible...,I can't believe the designers of the game thought this was ready to be released. The graphics are PS1 comparable and the frame rate is worse than PS1 NEED FOR SPEED. This game is a huge waiste of time and a failure. I am so dissapointed that I wish I could smack the designers and tell them to get back to work on this game until it is finished. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!
4,"Fun, but a slight repetitive feel","I bought this game a while back because Im a NFS fan. I like the fact that anybody can pick up the controller and just play. There are tons or cool cars and my personal favorites are: the NFS Corvette Z06, and the NFS F1 McLaren. The concept is to race and earn money. With the money earned you can buy different cars. The NFS vehicles boast higher zero to sixty times as well as improved handling and top speed. There is also a deep racing mode that can actually get kind of boring and the bonuses arent anything great. I gave it 3 stars because the graphics are average and the racing can be tedious and repetetive."
3,Not the best racing/driving game out there,"I rented this game and played it quite a bit. It is not bad but the physics stink. Adding to what others mentioned. If I get spun around in a McLaren or any high horsepower RWD car in a tight area, why can't I stomp on it and blow the rear around to get going again? Why when I hit the wall instead of bouncing off the way I am traveling with momentum, I spin around the opposite direction? It's a fun game, but the frustrating physics just [ticked] me off too many times to actually go out and buy it. Looks like I am still going back and playing Gotham Racing and Rallisport Challenge which to me are still better driving/racing games. The only good thing about NFS is the cops chasing you."
3,only on playstation,"This game is fun, I played it on ps2 first At a friends house years later, the helicopter that chases you isnt even cool looking like in ps2, and the tracks are all the same almost in the xbox overall its fun but on the ps2"
2,Fun at first but boring after a while.,I thought this game was cool at first but after the first week it got extremley boring. Whats up with the cars driving on the wrong side of the road. The graphics are ok and the good thing is the custom soundtracks because the games soundtrack sucks. Instead of buying this one buy underground 2
4,a MUST HAVE for any system...,"Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit 2 is a MUST HAVE for whatever system you have. The realistic enviroments include dust storms and brush fires, intense beams of light, and rain/snow. You can choose from several TOP LICENSED vehicles including the Ferrarri 360 Spider. Several great gaming modes include Hot Pursuit, Top Cop, Championship, and Be The Cop. For any X-Box owner: YOU MUST HAVE THIS GAME! The reason i gave it 4 stars is just because i don't like the X-Box's controller (i hate joysticks), for those of you who have a PS2, get NFS:HP2 for it, not X-Box. But if all you have is an X Box, then BUY IT NOW!"
1,THIS GAME STINKS!!! Don't waiste your money...,"...I feel robbed just renting it! This game is miserable in so many ways I don't know where to begin. As the race started, the first thing I noticed was, the frame rate is about 15-20 frames per second(the average is 30, a good-decent game is 60 frames per second. Heck, most racer games can generate 60 fps). There is NO excuse for this horrible frame rate. It looks more like pictures flashing in front of the screen! It's so choppy that I never felt like I was racing, just watching a bad cartoon. The SECOND thing I noticed was the graphics are pitiful. This game is NOT worthy to be on the XBOX(... the XBOX is capable of much more and I expect it!)..."
5,"cop chases, nice cars, sound good already","i only had this game for three days and from what a played let me tell you it's good. fast ferraris, mclarens and much more then i want to write. want some fun, get the game and be on the run........"
4,Still Gill - Still Great,"For those familiar with Gill's writing in GQ and The Times, this book will be a pleasure anticipated and delivered.For those not familiar with Gill's writing but in search of the modern, English-language essayist this book is an introduction to an artist in the genre. Gill's peripatetic life is documented here and, while he often loves the places he visits, he's at his best when exasperated and furious.Despite all of that, Gill loves the people he meets (although he'd deny it vehemently) and it comes through in his writing.A vivid collection of memories from places I'll never visit but which now seem as real to me as my own backyard."
1,A. A. Gill Please Stay Away,"The writer comes across as a conceited and nasty person, for example he wants to throw a TV set in the pool just because the stroke of the swimmer in it is not synchronized.He does not even bother to check facts; he refers to Los Alamos near Lompoc in California as:"" where they dicovered what you can do with a well-split atom"". This Los Alamos is in New Mexico a long way away. Taking cheap shots at everything is not amusing."
1,the first Ruth Rendell I did not enjoy,"For many years I have enjoyed reading Ruth Rendell's books. This was the first book I bought in its kindle edition and I had trouble recognizing her style. Not only is the this edition peppered with uncharacteristic spelling errors, I also got the feeling that the story moved in leaps and bounds, giving an unfinished impression. Towards the end of the book I even came across two author's notes, which were placed in brackets, referring to things the author meant to look up at some point. I have reached the conclusion that this electronic edition must have been copied from some kind of draft manuscript. I did not appreciate reading this version and found it inferior to what I am used to from this author."
4,review The Veiled One,"Very nice Inspector Wexford mystery from a master of the genre, Ruth Rendell. Her fans will not be disappointed by this book."
4,Rather somber,"Good plot, well structured. Side plot interesting and added to overall interest.I will look for more Wexford mysteries in the future."
1,Defective Product,"I regret that I have to return the Lean collection because the disc of Lawrence of Arabia is defective. And your instruction was to return the entire set. This is not the fault of Amazon but the fault of the manufacturers - Columbia Pictures and Sony. I had purchased an identical DVD of Lawwrence from a local electronics store and discovered that the disc was corrupted shortly after the start of the film's second half. I returned the disc to the store and was given another. It was corrupted in exactly the same place. That's when I ordered the Lean collection from Amazon in the hope of getting an uncorrupted disc of Lawrence. But, sad to say, the Lawrence disc in the Amazon trio of DVDs was also corrupted in precisely the same place. I am in the process of returning the collection in the hope of gaining a refund of the more than $40.00 I paid for the collection."
5,Fit Perfectly,"Seems to be working out well. Bought it because we put in a composite deck and we didn't want to ruin the deck. This grill pad fit perfectly under our standard sized grill. I wish I had seen the other colors, I think I would have tried to match the deck color. Oh well !"
5,very helpful for the higher level student and serious reader,"This book is a must for English majors, Comp. Lit. majors, graduate students in literature (those who aren't too busy grinding away, wasting their time on trendy but sterile literary theory). For those who wish to be truly literate, this book is a great help."
3,"""The Prophet of Romanticism"" Not Mentioned???","Any book like this fills a void just aching to be filled, but it must be noted that the list is anything but comprehensive. Someone pointed out that Salinger is not included. What century are we living in? I want to point out that one of my very favorite literary personages was snubbed; Georg Philipp Friedrich Freiherr von Hardenberg (aka NOVALIS; aka ""The Prophet of Romanticism""). Christ, if they haven't enough presence of mind to include Novalis... Christ, what hope is there for any of us? :/"
3,"Just the notes ma'am, just the notes.","While this is a great practice book for patterns, as a guitarist I felt it lacked in two areas. The first is that the patterns repeat in multiple keys per line. This is great for a Sax, Trumpet, etc. But for a guitar I just play the exact same finger pattern moving my hand up one fret. Not hard to change keys on guitar, thus the book was really short for me. Second and more importantly, there was no written explanation or teaching. I really liked The Serious Jazz Practice Book because it had many ideas sorted into categories like 4th's, 6th's, etc. I would have liked a few paragraphs explaining the music theory or intervals being used etc. That being said, it had lots of sheet music with lots of cool patterns. Enjoy."
1,Not for beginner or intermediates,"I was really looking forward to getting this book. But when I got it, there were no chords associated with the patterns. A little useless unless you have perfect pitch and know your scales and arpeggios inside-out. I wrote the publisher to comment/complain but their response was lame. But I'm sure they received this feedback before. Shame really, they could have asked the author to hand write the chords and re-published the book. Not a lot of work."
3,Incredible cases of torture & violation of human rights,"The Archdiocese of Sao Paulo was incredible courageous to put together this book during that period. I recognize that the book was a short report from more than 20 years of records, and more than 10,000 documents from the Brazilian military courts, but at least give us an idea of the horrors of the turture and the violations of human rigths that took place in Brazil during 1964 o 1979."
4,Clever Gizmo,"I love when people use their heads and come up with clever inovations. I use this holder with my music books on a music stand, and it works. It would be nice if it was made of aluminum, but then it would have to cost more, and the plastic seems sturdy enough. I just handle it gently.Others have complained that to turn a page, you first have to open the two arms that clamp down on both halves of the book. And one reviewer said you can solve that problem by removing the end-caps. But there's a little video clip on the manufacturer's website that shows you how to turn pages without removing the caps. I find that the caps are there to better grip the paper.If mine breaks, I'll be back here amending this review, but my sense is I won't have to."
2,Overpriced and clumsy,Ridiculous price for a spring-loaded plastic clip. And it will hold your book nicely but trying to pry it open to turn a page is a clumsy operation I choose not to attempt any longer. Relegated to the junk drawer.
4,Innovative idea and holds pages well. Just wish there was a better way to flip pages,"The idea is good and creative, and the product does hold pages open well on a variety of different books. However, be aware that it is more difficult to turn pages than they advertise, especially if you are simultaneously running on a treadmill or using the elliptical (which is, after all, what the product is intended to do). You basically need both hands to first lift up one of the prongs, and then to turn the page, and then to gently lower the prong back in place. You will also need a preexisting ledge on your exercise machine in order to make this work."
3,Misrepresented,"This product should not be advertised as a ""treadmill"" book holder, because no hardware or mounting system is provided to attach it to a treadmill. It holds the pages open, but you still have to hold the book."
1,Didn't work long...,"This worked well- for 3 times. Now the arms are completely loose, even though it was not used on large books, and it's completely useless.It's too bad, really, it worked so well until the 4th time that I was prepared to order another one- now I'm looking for a different solution to keeping my books open while working out."
5,FANTASTIC invention,"Must have if you use a treadmill, oliptical machine, bike etc. and read. Makes it so easy to work out. Very easy to use, convenient and practical. Won't be without one anymore."
4,treatmill book holder,great product for small lightweight books- not as effective with heavier books because it cannot hold back the pages as well.
3,"Not bad, not great","I have used my flip clip a couple of times, but it is so flimsy, I am afraid to break it. So far I have used it on large books, and so I use it to hold one side of the book open, because it won't fit on the top or bottom. Time will tell how long this will last. As I said, it feels pretty flimsy. I may just end up buying one of those large clear book holders, however cumbersome it may be to carry to/from the gym."
3,Good value,It did it's job while using the stationary bike...I was able to catch up on a lot of reading while working out.
2,Not what I expected,"I suppose I should have researched this more thoroughly before buying, so for everyone else out there--just be forewarned that this is a very lightweight product, and small (maybe 4""in length). It will not support your book, unless it is pretty light. It seems like more of a tool to keep the book open to the page you are reading. To be fair, I am attempting to read books that are about the size of a phonebook, so if you are just doing light reading, maybe it will work for you. I am sure it is great for that purpose, just not for my purpose. Otherwise, Amazon did its usual fabulous job of getting this out super quick. Love Amazon (just not this product)!"
3,"So, so utility","Used it on thick (over 600 pages) paperback book with a strong spine. Springs too weak to keep book open, pages in place. When I engaged clamp on fewer pages, that is, holding book open at the desired place but with the back arms against inside pages rather than resting outside on the covers, it worked a lot better. Again, this was the case with a very thick book.Worked OK with smaller books. Price too high. Perhaps half the price would have been more appropriate."
2,fragile and FRAGILE,"Unfortunately we have to use this for our treadmill (bought it twice in less than a year), since it's the only one that really fits with it. If you don't have to buy it, DON'T. Expensive, fragile and cmpletely not worth the quite high price. Did I mention it's fragile.... ?"
3,A must Read!,"I first read Whispers from the Grave, and was hooked on Leslie Rule's unique and creative style. I finished the book in less than three days, even though I don't read very often (can't find good material) A romance/sci-fi book, worth your money! If your reading Miss Rule---PLEASE WRITE MORE!"
4,Kill Me Again,"At first I thought it might be a bit childish....Wrong...it was riviting! Good build up and scary, couldn't put it down until I finished it at midnight last night...."
2,Kids Book,This book is basicly for kids and it's probably pretty good for that. It starts out very slow so I really couldnt get into it.
1,The secret of the Unknown Il trovatore,This Il trovatore must be the most secret - and unknown - Il trovatore. The singers are indeed very unknown - and so are the others. Sory that this CD is so unknown - maybee the reason is the amount of information of none!!! But I'm sure it's a cliffhanger..........
1,wow,"Phenomenological gymnastics with words. Adams interprets dreams from people he does not know and his insights feel cold, judgmental, lacking depth, emotion, substance and soul. He peppers his articles with unrelated biographical information that feels like a disguised appeal for attention and notoriety.There is even a picture of him in the book where he's fashioned himself to look like C.G. Jung and that's kind of eerie. He also quotes himself unnecessarily, juxtaposing his so-called scholarship with that of Jung and Freud as if he believes he is in their league somehow, which is an impressive, but ultimately dishonest and disappointing, fantasy."
4,good stuff,"not the best jawbreaker album, however, it still trumps most everything on the airwaves today. The cover of you don't know what you got till it's gone is worth the price alone. Good for what ails ya, but not as good as the b-side of 24 hr."
3,I didn't get it,"Jawbreaker is an awesome band and i like every other record they've made but i just didn't get this album their are some great songs on here like ""chesterfield king"", ""sheild your eyes"",""tour song"", ""sleep"" and "" like a secret"". the rest of the songs are just weird and just not as good to me. maybe it's just me or maybe i should listen to this a lot more. i would probably get this last"
1,Stick with 2002,"I have purchased every EA Sports NHL version from when the very first edition came out, way back when. This is the first time I have ever returned one. NHL 2003 is a huge, HUGE disappointment. The graphics aren't very good, the gameplay is much more along the lines of an arcade game than a simulator one, and the AI/goalies are terrible. On only my 2nd or 3rd game I was scoring 15 or more goals! Stick with 2002, it's a much better simulation and the games can be competitive."
4,nhl 2003,"I just bought this game , i would say its about a 3.5. It's not really an improvement on NHL 2002, in my view. The gameplay seems alot slower, even when the speed is toggled to the max. The default game is very slow, and the default camera view is not practical because it only shows the player with the puck and a small area around him. It seems like you cant control the players as well as NHL 2002. The graphics are nice, but the player faces don't seem as accurate as the previous version. The EA sport trax icon appears on the screen during the game, and is a distraction. Also, the menus for the game seem small, almost difficult to read. If you have the previous version, you probably wouldn't find much benefit from buying 2003. I would recommend renting it first, to see if you like it."
4,Great Improvements,"NHL 2003 provides many improvements from the year before. It has much improved graphics (where 2002 was lacking) and the different saves and deke moves that goalies and players make dazzles you and makes for beautiful plays. This game is easily the best NHL game on the market, as Sega's 2K3 cannot compare. It also provides many different difficulty levels to keep the user busy. Although it does not have a shootout mode, it does have a great franchise mode that provides for great seasons. THis is a game to get!"
5,"Great Gameplay, and smooth graphics!....","I don't know whats going on here...but my vote is five stars for this one! This game is very fast and fun, with smooth graphics, and a realistic challenge for patient people that like simulations better than arcade style sports games. Camera modes were easy to work with for me, and all the extra features just add to it's appeal!"
2,Another dud from the former heavyweight champ.,"The former champ continues to struggle. This year's version of NHL fails to capture the essence of NHL hockey like we all expect from EA Sports. The motion is choppy and the players movement is far from realistic. The camera angles are either too close to the ice or too far from the ice. The zoom feature still needs work. The commentary's attempt at humor is suited for a six year old, not a teenager or adult. Not funny and very annoying. EA Sports could take come lessons from Midway/Blackbox on their aracde hit NHL Hitz that has much better (and realistic) player movement and game play. Midway/Blackbox should go all the way and make a realistic hockey game. They will put EA Sports to shame.Rent it before you buy it. I am sorry I did not."
1,Just awful,"A plain BAD hockey game. Bad AI, tired gameplay. Avoid this piece of garbage and give Sega's NHL 2k3 a shot -- a company that cares about making a good hockey game."
2,A disappointment.,"I so enjoyed Kyle Stone's two science fiction novels that I was expecting to enjoy this more contemporary one. The lead character is difficult to empathize with, his actions and decisions seem erratic and his situation, well, do we feel sorry for him or consider him a maker of very bad choices."
5,Review,This has turned out to be a great buy. It's cheap and very useful. Works fine and has helped alot.
1,memory card,Out of 8mgs so they sent 16mgs instead with no change in price. How great was that!!!! Delivery was super too.
5,Works well.,"I got this because I recently bought a gamecube game for my Wii, since you can't use the Wii's internal memory to save gamecube games. This memory card has worked well so far, no glitches or anything like that. One thing to note, if you must have a sleek look for your Wii, you must take the card out after you finish playing gamecube games."
2,shobby,This grill was crafted poorly. The cooking surface was smaller then the pan. So I couldn't hold the grill part up properly. If I had to do it over again I would not have made this purchase. This product has made me second guess amazon.
3,A 3-D maze with hundreds of different levels,"Different Play modes allow for time trials, point totals and two player follow-the-leader. The time trials section has 301 puzzles to solve by moving on a series of connected and not connected blocks as you, a beach ball with specific rules of gravity, move throughout gathering keys in order to exit with the needed times. Hours of mind engrossing enivornments to venture through."
4,Roll Away is great!,I find this game highly addictive. It has tons of levels and simple controls. I picked up the controls in about 5 seconds and loved it! I recommend this to anyone who likes a game with nearly endless gameplay. Great game.
3,Mixed Emotions,"Interesting effort and a valid compliment to a guitarist's library. The alternating focus between American guitar history and a Vermont luthier's build is an effective vehicle for this guitar story. Ultimately this book fails to satisfy though. The book's central character, the author, is not self-portrayed as a very likeable character. It's like reading and interesting story while a man shoots himself in the foot.There's a lot of good information here, but the memoir is soiled by petty asides that make the author seem small."
3,Marred by Politics,"Guitar starts out promisingly, but over the course of the book Tim Brookes reveals more and more political beliefs. This might play well at NPR (where he is a contributor) but is screechy and out of place in this subject. Everything boils down to race or class. This comes at the expense of insights into the characters of the many luthiers and musicians who are mentioned and quickly associated to some identity group. If you love NPR and the guitar, buy this book. If you can hold your nose while he drops lines such as ""the naked greed of the Thatcher conservatives"" then it's a nice read by someone who clearly loves the guitar."
3,Mixed emotions,"This review is NOT about the content of the book. I believe it is an excellent work. However, I paid for a ""new"" book, and the book that arrived had multiple tears in the dust jacket, making it unusable as a gift. The packaging was secure and undamaged, so the book was placed into the container in damaged condition. I did not have enough lead time to send it back for a replacement, as the birthday of the recipient was just a couple of days away from the time it was received. This was very disappointing and will certainly make me think twice about ordering books intended as gifts from Amazon."
4,passion and history in one book,"Tim Brookes renews his passion for the instrument afterhis Fylde is broken by baggage handlers. His is apersonal account of ordering, watching and waiting forthe finished product as it is being built - andinterspersing the account with guitar history.Enjoyable except when he gets carried away with listsof famous performers. Brooks tends to name every artistwho ever held the instrument. Pictures are includedexcept for a clear and detailed photo of his ownfinished product.Overall the book is a good read for the history of theinstrument and for understanding the intricaterelationship of wood types to melodic sound. He clearlyhas a passion for the guitar and its intimateconnection to the player.Enjoyable."
3,Subtitle: More than you ever wanted to know about guitar history,"I guess I'm in the minority here. This book is extensively researched and beautifully written. That being said, the alternating chapters on guitar history seem to go into agonizing detail about every individual who has ever played or crafted a guitar in the last 500 years. The author painstakingly mentions every notable individual in guitar history, and many who are not so notable. You really need to be fascinated with guitar history to get into this book. Unfortunately, there's not much ""meat"" about the crafting of the author's new guitar."
4,Page Holder for Books,"This book page holder is not a toy, but a necessity for reading books with stiff bindings. It allows one to read music books at the piano and play or read paper-back books without having to hold the pages down. It is quite effective, not perfect. It works on large or small books. mike"
3,Not what I expected,This is my 4th book holder. Still trying to find one that really works well. This one is not any better than the others. I gave one as a gift and have not had a response from my giftee. So I gather she was not overwhelmed either.
5,Flip book holder works great!,I use this flip book holder to help hold a book open on a music stand so I can read while I jog on the treadmill. Works great. Bought a set of two so my son can have his own book going.
3,Nice for the IPad but not for my book,"This product left me frustrated when I was trying to read my book on the elliptical. At first I was really excited because it held the book open so well but when I went to turn the page I had difficulties pulling the page out without ripping it. I have tried many different approaches to turning the page but have not found any that don't through me off a step or two on my pacing with the machine. Overall, it is frustrating, but it did great holding my iPad in place. So from here on out I read electronic copies of books when I'm at the gym."
2,poor quality,"poor quality for the price. I own 2 oakworks and 1 stronglite, have had all for 10 plus years, oakworks always need tightening and are a pain to adjust height. the stronglite is a work horse, never needs repair, love removable knee pads for disabled or elderly clients"
4,A really great 3rd album,"The band slog on without ravey Davey Moore and what a slog it isn't. This is a really superior album with not a single dud track. A much more cohesive album than Sirena and as good if not, in some ways, better than the first.It's interesting to compare this album with Davey Moore's solo album given that Moore wrote all of Cousteau's previous material. I have both albums and this one is streets ahead of Mr Moore's effort.Well done Cousteau!"
5,Highly underated aural bliss,"This album took me 3 years to buy, mainly because it was'nt available (readily,anyway)in Australia. I just presumed that it probably was'nt up to scratch.Eventually I saw the light! How wrong one can be? How many times can you listen to an album? The 3 Cousteau albums...every track, so good, every album,so good. Why are they not household names?? Moreau,Cousteau....Who cares! Brilliant."
5,"incredibily talented, this band needs to be promoted more.","Each individual in this band is exceptional in their own right. I recently became aware of them and have difficulty finding any information, I wish they were ""out there"" more."
4,Ultraspank - talent cut far too short,"I was introduced to Ultraspank (I weird name I thought) a short while ago and I'm currently looking for their two albums as I just seem to keep liking them more.Their music is an exceptional blend of electronica metal with both hardcore and melodic vocals and cool effects which makes for very interesting and addictive sounds - perfect for a good car stereo cruising down the main street on a friday or saturday night!.Myself and many people I know think this band is horribly under-rated and for a band that wasn't terribly well known the production on the recordings is extremely good. I haven't heard any live tracks - I'm eagre to though.From what i've heard, the band being dropped & breaking up, I'm a little saddened, disheartened - and [ticked] off :/ Ultraspank are a good band and hopefully they'll make a return someday!To have had them make two albums is better than if they never existed! so buy them already!"
5,BASS!!!,"I was looking for an iPod audio system that had a lot of bass but also good quality and this is it. I only have 2 complaints. When it's turned down to a low volume setting and you're standing close enough to the system, you hear a slight hum. Nothing big and you most likely won't be listening to it that low. Second complaint is that the system only works while it's plugged in so you can't really take is anywhere.The remote is great also. It has treble and bass controls and a button so you can return to all your original settings. I didn't think I would use that button as much as I do.Overall, I'm glad I chose this one over it's competitors. I just wish it came in black."
2,Colorado: Moments in Time by Grant Collier,"A few good photos, but mainly unremarkable, even amateurish. I was surprised that a publisher would want to expend the resources. Positive reviews are inconceivable, and the apparent idea that enlarging photos will make up for their deficiencies is untenable. Purchased on the stength of a posted review, I was completely disappointed."
5,Brazilian flag.,"The flag is a nice, large size, colorful and bright. It looks great on the ceiling in my son's room."
4,Big Flag,I was hoping that this wouldn't be a small dinky flag and it isn't this flag is quite large and is made of a great wear and tear proof material. I have this hung up on the ceiling of my closet but it could easily be used outside and I don't think it would have a problem holding up. Very satisfied.
3,"Avoid outdoors; otherwise, good product","I bought this for a multi cultural event at the college I work at and for indoor purposes, this is a good product. However, I would strongly recommend against using this outdoors, even in a covered area; I made that mistake with a few other flags and they were faded and largely destroyed within 18 months. Still, these sorts of flags were never rated for outdoor use so for the purpose intended, they are fine."
4,Good quality for the price!,Good quality for the price! Fast delivery! Not super high quality material but we were looking for a flag that would be used every once in a while and did not want to pay $30 for a high quality flag!
3,Fun reading; not much use for civilian self-defense.,"I was looking for a book about some basic self-defense using improvised weapons. Long ago I saw a book about bo staff fighting that talked about using umbrellas, canes and the like for self-defense, and was hoping this would be of the same order.It is amusing and a great read. ""Animal"" talks like a Marvel Comics character like The Thing or Wolverine, and you can practically hear the Bronx voice as you read. But this material is intended for muscle men who work out regularly in a martial arts gym, who want fighting skills more real-world-based than formal martial arts. For someone who doesn't intend to fight for a living, or who would never enter a biker bar full of violent crackheads, the book has little practical use. Sorry, Animal, I ain't Batman. I'm more like Flounder from ""Animal House,"" and this book won't help me."
4,All New Tricks for Trainers,This is a great book for any trainer looking to make any topic more interesting. If you find yourself teaching the same topics over and over this book can show you some great ways to make your audience more excited and interested. I would highly recommend this book as it has some great techniques.
5,A must have for any PSX sim fan!,"This game is wonderful. The graphics, sound and overall presentation make it seem like you're in the thick of a galactic war. The ships fly very fluidly and the action is fast and furious. Oh yeah, in regard to the complaint another reviewer about your first ship being too slow, it's war live with it! The inferiority of your side's spacecraft is made even more obvious when you get in to battles with ships hundreds of times larger than you. You are freedom fighters after all."
1,Very Bad Game!,This game is very awful. I never got past the first level because the (1) enemy fighter was to fast and I kept on accidentaly firing at my own ships. The graphics are horible to.
4,Very good,"Esta escrito de una manera facil de entender y realmemte original. Las recetas son autenticas regionales y si se siguen exactamente como esta escrito, cocinara el platillo exactamente como debe ser. Es algo avanzado. Incluye algunos temas culturales interesantes y un poco del estilo de vida de la autora que lo cual es tambien muy interesante"
3,Lack of photographs,"The recipes look great however, there are no photographs whatsoever. I do like to refer to a photo to see what the plated dish looks like."
2,Umm....Sprechen Sie Deutsch?,"Not for someone that doesn't have loads of spare time to devote to this. I think I'm a pretty good cook, and I'm used to working with cook books. But I found this book very overwhelming. There are no pictures, so you better already know the cuisine very well. Most cookbooks have at least a few pictures thrown in for inspiration -- or at least scenes of the environment where the dish originated. How else am I to evoke that Mexican feeling? Not from the book. Also, I was hoping I could get away with making something that would take less than 5 hours, but out of luck on that count too. You are supposed to make your own tortillas for every recipe, yeah right! That would be like making your own pasta every time you wanted to have dinner.Perhaps if you had a house full of maids like the author to do all the hard stuff for you, but then they would probably not need this book!"
3,Should have been better,"I'm the biggest Diana Kennedy fan ever. I wouldn't be without her earlier books except MY MEXICO, which is good but for me not essential. This is a compilation and some things are cut, some are added and some recipes refer to the earlier books that this one volume is supposed to replace. An example is tamales. Her earlier books have pages of instructions and theories in addition to stories. Here, we get the same story but then are referred to CUISINES OF MEXICO for detailed instructions for tamale masa. CUISINES has overly-pedantic recipes in the style of MASTERING THE ART OF FRENCH COOKING so the update in style is welcome, but I wouldn't dream of not having the complete versions of the earlier books. Personally, I think her editor needs to be spanked."
5,I have always Loved Boys II Men,I have always loved Boys II Men and I thank you for being able to get this from you since it was only to get it from over seas thank you
5,Still got it,"The Boyz still got it! The perfect love song, morning love, the last time, and crush are hot tracks to check out!!! Keep on making that music fellas"
4,Gets the job done,I did not expect this product to actually be 2 separate planners. One side is the weekly and the other the monthly. I'm more accostumed to the planners that have the monthly and weekly calenders combined. This product still provides what I need. The only issue is that the monthly planner blocks are very small and cannot fit much text.
4,Satisfied Customer,I've been using Casio Ribbons on my cw50 Disk titler and am very safisfied with the results.
5,When In Doubt...Blame A Jew,"When In Doubt...Blame A Jew is a memoir unlike any other. Candid and non-apologetic, Mr. Abbott hits anti-Semitism head-on by closely examining the manifestation of such hate and ignorance with personal stories and historical accounts. While the title may be shocking to some, you'll discover that this book is truly insightful, thought provoking and well researched. There is a great deal of fascinating material in the book and Mr. Abbott has an innate ability to discuss a topic too often avoided without sounding hypocritical or pious. I especially enjoyed the dry sense of humor peppered throughout the book along with his touching tribute to his loving wife Maureen.I highly recommend this book to people of all faiths as it is a book that makes an important contribution and raises many questions for debate."
5,Many things i didn't know,"After reading this book ""When In Doubt Blame A Jew"" it really opened my eyes to alot of things i never knew about. Jews have had it rough their entire lives.This book wasted no time getting striahgt to the point. Chapter 2 was a enteresting chapter to me. It explained more to me then i could ever imagine.For me to have thought that my race ""AfroAmericans""had it rough is a over statement once you have read this book.I must admit i take my hat off to the jewish population for their strienth to carry on and over come the poverty ect. that they had to go through hundreds of years ago and the decrimintion that they continue to go through .I juust hope and pray that this ignorance will soon come to a end. In closing i would like to thank the auther of this book for educating me on the Jewish people. This auther deserves a standing ovation."
5,Incredibly Informative,"Being of a different religion, I found this book to be insightful and intelligently written. There were many misconceptions I had of the jewish religion, and this book addressed the issues and Ideas I once held to be true. My sincere thanks to the author."
5,"Excellent, British folk music at its best.","Vin, is a brilliant folk singer, he has a long string of top rate, world class, releases concentrating on social issues in England but also covering world events. His songs carry a message. That this man is not a world music figure is a poor reflection on popularism and underlines the dominace of thin US culture. We hear so much poor US ""folk"" (country) music while Vin's work goes unappreciated."
3,O.K but you need stamina,"Our friends, Keith & Jackie H. introduced us to this music. Quite unusual, and very emotional. Hits the heartstrings hard if you're not prepared. keith totally addicted to it, but hasn't persuaded anyone else to buy it. Yet!"
4,Under-represented,"Vin must lack friends in the CD industry or the ambition to have a far-reaching audience. I've heard him perform twice here in Central Australia in the late 80s and 90s, and both occasions were absolutely stunning. that a lifetime in the music business has issued one CD boggles my brain. Such an awesome musician, comic, and gifted, insightful writer with a voice charged to deliver the rage, pity, tenderness, whatever that he turns his attention to. I wouldn't rate this a 5 star outing as I have bootlegged tapes from concerts here in town which deliver a far deeper and wider showcase of his talents. But better this on CD than nothing. The title track is sweet but not the highlight of the album. Go for it."
5,Wonderful!,"I've seen Vin perform three times (while we lived in Kuala Lumpur...he would swing through every couple of years!) Some of the very best, truly enjoyable musical evenings were spent at his performances. There are songs, to this day, that move me to tears. He is also a very very funny man...a wonderful artist!"
2,Average read,Disappointed overall.Light on content.Diagrams were reproduced extremely poorly & appeared to be screen captures from PDF format US Army field manuals.Alot of the content also appeared to be regurgitated from Army training manuals.If you want a quick read & a general overview then give it a go otherwise give it a miss.
3,"Some good, some inaccurate","Most of the information in the book seems to be decent, if somewhat basic. I haven't had a chance to try all of it, so I can't say for certain how valid they are.One area that is NOT valid is the part about using a watch and the sun to navigate. This technique is inconsistent but keeps getting taught as if it was a substitute for a compass.Think about it. In late June, what time does the sun rise and set where you are? Now what time does it rise and set in late December? The compass points haven't changed, nor has the movement rate of the hands on your watch. Unless you can also factor in these differences, your navigation is going to be off, sometimes by a significant degree.Unfortunately, seeing this known-inaccurate technique included in this books casts a shadow of doubt on the rest of the book, for me."
4,Just another map and compass book,"If you've read a handful of other US Military manuals you'll recognize this book as being heavily influenced and derived from the same sources. It's not really any new information or presentation techniques. It's not a bad book, it's just nothing special."
4,Even for a non-survivalist quite interesting,"I'm not a wilderness or survivalist enthusiast; I'm doing research for a novel that I'm working on. So I can't vouch for the expertise of the writer. But the information is clear, reasonably well written and interesting. Even for the lay reader there is valuable info."
5,A bullseye for E&E,"Very good!! A must Read! I gained extremely valuable information from this book, and it was very easy to read."
4,Good addition to the library!,"Michael Chesbro has a very easy to read writing style. Based on the style and interesting material, I zipped through this book in just a couple of days. Lots of information and tips that I haven't found elsewhere in print. The book doesn't get bogged down trying to re-teach and re-hash things found in other survival books. It directs you to other sources where necessary rather than spending a lot of time on topics covered elsewhere. I consider this a good addition to my survival library simply because it approaches a subject from a different perspective and made me think about some topics differently."
2,An introduction only,"There are many survival books out there and this one promised to go beyond what has been written before by claiming to teach one to evade pursuit and survival in the wilds. Unfortunately, after reading the entire book, I was left pondering what I had actually learnt.Wilderness Evasion turned out to be a basic review of other literature and only touched briefly on the various survival methods available, and rarely went into detail of how to use them effectively. Besides this, the 'evasion' aspect was covered in only one chapter; the rest of the book covering commonly known survival methods.I'm sure there are better texts on offer. Pity."
5,If You Go Into The Woods - READ THIS BOOK,"I have to confess to being a fan of the author Michael Chesbro. His books offer lots of practical information, and ""Wilderness Evasion"" is no exception. The ability to stay out of sight in remote and wilderness areas has its place even today. Wilderness Evasion teaches you how to avoid being tracked, how to build low-key shelters, how to avoid dogs, find food, and generally 'stay lost' when you want to.I am not a big outdoorsman, but I do like to take weekend backpacking trips, and this book has taught me how to avoid and evade the two-legged predators one sometimes meets in remote and out-of-the-way place.GREAT BOOK - Get It While You Can!"
3,If you're nuts,"This book isn't too bad if you are a fugitive and would like to know how to evade the police if they should ever come knocking on your door at 2am. If that were the case you could easily jump out of your bedroom window and get to your wilderness, that you have previously prepared for such an event, and live for months on the cache's that you hid. I guess there are a few things in this book worth taking a look at but just know that unless you are constantly looking over your shoulder for big brother you aren't going to get much out of it."
4,RIP realy catchy song,"Amy Winehouse had a raw and throwback vibe to her voice and especially her music and sadly she went before her time. she told her storys through her music uncut and raw and the irony is that some people didn't hear those emotions coming across fully, but this songs hit and was the truth. it truly captured what she was dealing with. RIP"
1,Parenting for dummies.,"Kids cannot be raised according the rules set in a book. Each kid is a unique individual and would be negatively impacted by a inflexible parent. If you feel the need to read this book, you obviously have no trust of your child, or your parenting abilities. Taking advice from somebody else about your own child is never the way to go."
1,My least favorite!,"So far I've tried the Lasinoh and Johnson & Johnson in addition to the Medela brand. I must say, these are the worst! They are paper thin, rustle and don't feel comfortable at all! I like Johnson & Johnson the best, as they are contoured and comfortable."
1,Leaked. 'nuff said.,"I've tried several brands of nursing pads and have had experience with nursing pads with three different babies of varying degrees of quantity of milk and nursing. I've tried Medela nursing pads with all three. The only time Medela worked is if I barely leaked, like a few drops. Anything beyond that, the pads would leak. The best pads I've found that held up to leaking was Lansinoh. It could hold so much milk that I didn't have to worry about being embarrassed that I leaked through my shirt."
2,Lansinoh is better,PROSI've never leaked.It's really thin.CONSIt feels like plastic.It does not allow my skin to breathe and make my breasts really itchy.It won't stick to your bra. The small sticky tab doesn't do much.It stinks at the end of the day.Yellow powder gets on your fingers if you open the wrapper wrong.Lansinoh has two sticky tabs that work. And it doesn't make my breasts itchy or sweaty. And their wrappers do not have any weird coloring on it.
4,My wife prefers them...,"All I can say about this product is the following:- my wife received them for a baby shower gift, among other brands- my wife is almost out of them, our child is 2.5 months old (box of 60)- my wife is asking me to reorder these pads because she likes them and they worked as advertisedIt's a matter of personal preference for most, and I'm sure different situations call for different pads (performance, fit, comfort, etc) but my wife likes them and wants more, so I will give it 4 stars. They aren't perfect, but they're the best that she has tried (we received a few different types as gifts)."
1,Hate these pads!!!!!,"I absolutely hate...despise...loathe these pads. I leaked at least 3 to 4 times a day while using them. They are useless and did nothing to give me protection. Before I started using them I was using the Lansinoh brand pads and I loved them. I never had any problems, but then I got a box of these as a gift and figured I'd try them. I will not even use the rest of the box. I would not recommend these to anyone!"
2,nursing pads,"The nursing pads are leak resistance but I didnt like the fact that they are made with like a plastic backing, which causes itching."
1,Super aggravating,"The first problem I came across when using these pads was the packaging. There is printing on the wrapper that says ""open"" and on some of the packages, that printing correlates to a perforation. However, on most packages it doesn't. So, you end up ripping the plastic open and the yellow paint flakes off all over your hands. The next flaw with this product is the adhesive strip. There is only one and it is pretty small. So, when your nursing bra/tank is pressed up against you, the pad is in place no problem. However, every time you fold your bra/tank down to nurse the pad rolls up on itself so when you go to button up again you have to reach into your shirt and unroll the pad and put it back in place. This brings me to my third complaint. The more times you do this the cotton inside the plastic lining starts to get bunched up and gets lumpy under your shirt. Not well made. Would not recommend."
3,ok pads,"being individually wrapped is a pain when you need to grab one in a hurry. they are absorbent enough for me, but anyone with heavier leakage would be better off with something else. i prefer the lasinoh pads to these. (though the lasinoh ones come individually wrapped too. grr)"
2,Johnson and Johson are better,I personally don't like these. I leaked milk all the time and these were damp and they always fell off. The Johnson and Johnson ones are less expensive and they hold more. I am changing the Jonson and Johnson ones about three or four times a day and these about 10 times a day. My bra was always soaked and did'nt hold much protection. I was very disappointed but it was a learning experience.
4,Nice and thin!,"What can I say? I went out and got these upon recommendation on here, and I really like them. They are thin and super absorbant. I NEVER had any leaks while wearing them."
2,Go with the washables,"I found these pads to be alright as far as disposables go I suppose but I HIGHLY RECOMMEND using the Medela washables, which are wonderful. They hold alot and are really soft and convienent. Spend the bit of extra money and buy the washables, they're all around a better investment and better for the environment too."
3,What's the most absorbent pad?,"I don't know about the rest of you, but when my milk came in I was continually drenched. I tried reusable pads and those just got soaked and my top would get wet. I tried johnson & johnson which was a waste of money, evenflow I leaked everywhere, even the Medela didn't keep me from leaking. I've only found 2 brands that I will ever buy again. Gerber Heavy Flow or Lansinoh, I can at least go for 2-3 hours before I have to replace them. I no longer wake up in the middle of the night soaked. This is just information that I wish I would have known before I tried every brand on the market."
5,Awesome protection!!,I leak a lot and I've tried washable pads and avent pads with dissapointment. Once I tried the Medela pads I was ecstatic because they held so much. I like how they contour to the shape of the breast and look very discreet under clothing and I love how I barely have to change them. I would highly recommend these pads! I can't live without them.
1,Bunch up,"I received the Medela nursing pads as a sample and must say I am not impressed. Sure the pads are large and thin, but they bunch up giving me a lumpy breast appearance. Not very inconspicuous. Everytime I breast fed my son, I had a hard time trying to put the pad back in. I prefer the Johnson and Johnson pads because they are thicker, contoured, and less expensive. I will not be buying the Medela."
2,"They work, but are very uncomfortable","I've always used Lansinoh nursing pads, but decided to try these, since they were half as expensive. I found out there's a reason they're half as expensive. They're incredibly itchy! Many times the pleat on the inside has a scratchy piece of glue that rubs and is uncomfortable. Also, after nursing once or twice the stuffing gets all messed up and bunchy, which is a huge pain in public because it's hard to change them discreetly, but if you don't, it looks like you have a wad of Kleenex stuffed into your bra. Not cool. Stick with Lansinoh."
2,So uncomfortable!,"I received a sample of these nursing pads. They were reasonably absorbent, but felt terrible! They sounded and felt like I had a piece of wrapping paper in my bra. I'm glad it was just a sample and I hadn't spent any money on a whole box."
2,Poorly made,My wife got some of these pads for free with my pump. She would not recommend them. When she used them the absorbent padding inside moved around and fell to the bottom of the pad so there was only the plastic lining left where she needed absorbency.
3,Not the best pads,"I have tried Lansinoh, Medela, Johnson & Johnson, and Playtex nursing pads. The Lansinoh are best overall: great absorbancy, nice countoured shape, and good adhesive that stays in place without bunching up. J&J were also great, but I'd recommend them to women who size A or B since they are smaller in size. Playtex has great absorbancy but they are not at all countoured so they bulge unless you have the perfect bra that will hide a huge bulge. Medela are super thin, therefore much less absorbant, and also the core gets bunched up inside the outer lining so they are almost impossible to unbunch between feedings. The adhesive stinks too, so they don't stay in place too long. So overall I recommend J&J to smaller women (cup A or B), and the Lansinoh to larger women (cup C and above)."
2,I choose Lansinoh over the Medela!!,I found these nursing pads to be a bit scratchy and uncomfortable. My favorite brand is the Lansinoh pads. They are super absorbent and comfy at the same time!!
5,The best pads!,"I took a chance on these pads and I'm so happy I did. I leaked all the time with the Johnson & Johnson pads, especially at night. I have yet to leak with these pads. I highly recommend them."
3,Great for women who hardly leak,"These are great for a short amount of time, especially to wear with form fitting clothing, although they are not completely bulk and wrinkly free. But I leak quite a bit during the day, so these get soaked real fast. I can nott use on daily basis, only on special ocassions."
2,Could be designed much better,"These pads are definitely due for some revamping. When women can buy nearly customized bras based on chest width and cup size, it's ridiculous to have a ""one pad fits all"" type of product. I have read other reviews and women complain about washable/reusable pads, but after trying everything out there, I would argue that washable pads:*fit better*look better from the outside (these look like you're stuffing with Kleenex)*are a lot easier to put back in one-handed while holding a baby - no messing around with annoying adhesives and strange folds in the materialDisposable do tend to be better for women who leak a lot, but before settling on these pads, try both. I bought every kind out there, both reusable and disposable, and found some I swear by from Mimi Maternity. They fit well, aren't noticable, and won't leak."
1,Won't last very long...,"Purchased this item back in 2007 for the kitchen. Seldom used it during 2007-2009, just began to put some good viewing hours on it recently. When all of a sudden, picture is no longer visible. Audio comes through. I wasn't expecting this product to die out like that so early... Will not buy anything Haier ever...."
3,save your money,"This TV is cheap. Sound is poor and the picture options are not clear. picture is OK. Unless you only have limited funds ,spend another twenty dollars and get another brand."
4,Quality item!,"My family's Christmas wouldn't be the same w/out Belgi Gallettes. My 94 yr old grandmother, mom, and I all own this iron and have never been let down by it. It works perfectly year after year (and grandma and mom have been using theirs for decades). I will admit that when I first started using mine I had to toss a lot of cookies, as they stuck to the iron terribly. After a few batches it became seasoned and they come out beautifully."
2,Not Very Thin,When I was searching for a belgian cookie iron this seemed to be the only electric iron available. this iron made cookies that were too thick. A better iron was made by Dan Verkinderen it was available under Lukken Cookie Iron. Both cast iron stove top model and electric model do a better job
1,Better Make Sure That You Have A New PC !!!!!,"Norton worked o.k on my new computers. However, if you have an older computer you better get Mcafee Antivirus. The Norton program is HUGE. It will slow it all down if you have less than a PIV cpu in your computer. If you have a PIII or less-watch out-keep your receipt-you will not be a happy camper."
3,A2Norton2006review,This product is good because it still covers older PC's with older operating systems. However it is a memory hog and takes too long to load. The Liveupdate robs the computer's performance but does a good job of screening viruses. Also the system requirements are understated. It takes at least an additional 100MG just for virus definition updates. However the delivery service from the Amazon vendor was excellent.
2,I've always had Norton but am planning to defect to something else,"I read all the bad reviews of this product, but decided I've always gone with Nortons and they are the big name in anti-virus, so I got this. My machine is slow and clunky and I've been reading reviews -- and taking them more serious. This year, I'm planning to defect and give up on Norton's once and for all. Maybe my machine performance will get better -- friends who've removed it say their machine's performance has improved dramatically. I'm sorry I didn't pay attention to the reviews last year."
2,Needs improvement,"I was prompted by Symantec to renew my 2005 version one month before expiry, so I did. It an extremley difficult download but after re-booting my computer three times it finally worked...sort of. The 2006 version deleted my, still valid 2005 version; in my case this amounted to paying for 12 months service and getting 11 months.I also noticed that it did not tranfer any of the settings to the new version. The Symantec person that I spoke to said that this was because ""this is a whole new program"", but transferance of user settings seems a reasonable expectation today, does it not?Finally, contacting Symantec was an experience in itself. I want service, not a diversion project. I cancelled my order and this prompts my one compliment, they were very accommodating in cancelling my order."
1,Not for Windows 2000,My computer slowed considerably after installing this product. I also had to unplug my computer because it would just crash in the middle of updating or opening my programs. BEWARE!
1,Quickest uninstallation I've ever done,"We received a trial of Norton Antivirus for our computer, which I installed after getting our internet connection to work. Guess what connection didn't work after setting up Norton Antivirus? Maybe NA works, but their user interface is impossible. I'll stick with Avast and AVG for my *free* anti-virus protection, thanks."
1,"If you ain't tech savvy, STAY AWAY",I buy expensive virus protection because if I'm hit I have very little idea on how to fix things. The bitter irony is that the Norton 2006 that I purchased online is the thing that I have had to fix. They gave me this shpeel about how it may not be compatible with the Norton 2005 that I had installed and that is why it would not work. What the $%*#!! Your product is not compatible with your own product?! Remove your heads from that place and get it right. I still can't enable the auto-protect after 3-4 months of ownership and many trips to the web site and fix it page. Crapola. I feel frustrated and burned by Norton.
3,"2005 vs. 2006, Make sure it is what is says","I ordered Norton AntiVirus 2006 [CD].It shown as 2005 when loaded onto PC and would not install. A screen ""unable to determine the location of the virus definition files"" would pop up whenever I rebooted my laptop. I returned the package and got another copy ""Norton 2006"". Yet it is still a Norton 2005, even the CD and the Box says 2006. But this time it installed, because, just to play it safe, I had removed my original copy of 2005. And it went to Symantec and did a LiveUpdate immediately. Since I got the most current virus definition data, and a new product key was assigned, I did not bother to return it again. But now Sysmantec said I sent in wrong rebate form, and asked me to send the whole thing again, which I've already sent them all. I think these incidents just are not professinal and not user friendly at all."
1,Do not buy this product!,"I fell for the upgraded ploy when renewing my NAV 2005 and it was a disaster. After installing 2006 my computer completely froze. After finally getting thru to support (you may even have to pay $30 bucks for the call!) I was given 4 pages of detailed instructions for adjusting permissions in Windows registry. With that I could use my computer again but could never complete the installation to activate the program. After spending hours trying everything recommended by support - at least twice - I uninstalled and bought McAfee. That installation was flawless. Buy McAfee, or anything but this!"
5,Norton AntiVirus 2006,"Excellent product. 2006 added a bunch of features that my 2004 version did not have. It's more user-friendly, includes Spyware detection, runs faster, and much more. I am very satisfied with this product."
4,Norton 2006,Received it when I was told it will get here. Easy to install. Also received rebate already!!!!
3,rebate problems,"Has anybody else had problems with getting Norton rebates? The form asked for ""a copy of a previous competitors product"". What is a copy? I sent the actual CD for two different Norton products and got a notice that the copy was not present so no rebate. I then sent the front page of a competitors product and still no rebate."
2,Installation unpredictable - extremely poor support,"I installed Norton Antivirus purchased at Costco on 18Mar06, first on my laptop and then on my home computer. The installation took me through a row of somewhat unpredictable screens and reboots. I received a confirmation email with my Norton Account. So far nothing wrong, just not smooth.The problem is with the installation on a second computer. The intallation does not save the product key, therefore you never know if your computer is actually protected. Every couple of weeks I get a reminder of renewal. I had to reinstall Norton twice already. TOday I went through the troubleshooting site and ended looping through suggestions, but none provides a solution.Telephone support is useless - no one at the other end of the line at all.Conclusion -- I am taking Norton back to Costco for a refund and get something else"
1,Very disappointing,"I have used Norton Anti-Virus products on my computer since its purchase in 2002 and have not had one problem. That is why I decided to buy the 2006 version. Bad choice on my part. I spent an entire weekend, using 10 hours of my time and 6 phone calls to their customer service line, only to find out after numerous installations and un-installations, that this particular version was not compatible with my computer. The only compliment I can pay Amazon is that I received it quickly and was given a credit equally as quickly. I ended up with McAfee as my 2006 anti-virus and have been extremely happy."
1,! What were the designers thinking?,"I was not able to update my ""internet Security"" so I just bought this instead. I do not like it. It has a bouffy unprofessional appearance and while perusing the internet a screen with the status pops up around seven times or so. After un checking all the boxes to remove the pop-up window it still continues to pop up. High five for the virus protection but thumbs down on the large hard-to-ignore pop-up window. On the plus side the installation was quick and easy with no problems."
1,Slow pokin' CPU eatin' monster,"NAV 2006 has wound up being more overhead on my PC than my applications. (It give's AOL some good competition competing for CPU cycles)The activation is a pain in the #@&.It's gone, $$ wasted, but I've switched to McAfee and can't complain. Add some SPYBOT Search & Destroy with Webroot Spysweeper or CounterSpy and you're all set."
2,Overpowering AntiVirus,This Antivirus software will first tease you with installation permissions errors that baffel tech support and then go on to convince you that you need a CPU upgrade. The product does function as Antivirus software..... I gave up on using my machine as its was primarilly busy checking for virus issues days after I completed installation and updates.
3,I like Norton AV - I just shoulda updated my 2005 version instead,"I always use Norton AV on my computer, so I'm a fan of it. I was torn this year between just paying the $30 for updating my Norton 2005 for a year, or buying the new NAV 2006. Well, I wound up buying NAV 2006, as it said it has anti-spyware now, even though it was a few dollars more than just buying another year on last year's NAV. Well, I run both Spybot and Ad-aware on my computer regularly, and I haven't seen any decrease in the number of items they find! I thought with NAV 2006 keeping spyware off my computer, Ad-aware and Spybot wouldn't find anything anymore - I was wrong. My advice - just spend the $30 to update last year's version online - paying even a little extra for this year's version isn't worth it."
2,AV 2006 intallation and registration problems,"I have installed it, removed it and re-installed it. It finally said the product was activated. but it was not as the subscription was marked as expired before I began. By calling an 800 number I was finally able to get an unlock key and the activation/subscription issue was resolved. It has never managed to register the product key on their server. I tkeeps sayning cant do that now try again later.If you allow it to scan for some of the things other than virus, worms, adware and spyware, it get hung up in scanning the _Restore directory.Some of their earlier products were more user friendly."
1,Bloatware to the extreme,"This is an absolute horrible piece of software. Do not even think of installing this on an older system. Newer systems will experience a dramatic performance hit. I'm sure the virus protection itself is well done, but the cost of making your system near unusable defeats the purpose. Symantec, in the future just make the software run transparently in the background. No one cares about getting little pop up windows that basically says everything is okay. And PLEASE be more efficient with your programmming. Not everyone is running dual-core computers with 4GB of RAM."
1,Antivirus software that behaves like a virus.,"Norton Antivirus's subscription renewal advertising has impaired my computer's functionality. Four weeks before the one-year update subscription expired, I began getting pop-ups offering only two choices: buy a renewal subscription immediately or be reminded in one day. I would click the box for one day and the popup would be back in a hour. Now that the subscription has expired, the pop-up options are to buy the renewal immediately or be reminded in 15 days. When I click 15 days, it is back a few days later. In the meantime, the yellow Norton screen has begun flashing when other programs are running. This is extremely annoying. I would have expected an established antivirus software company to be more considerate of its customers."
1,Don't do it!!,"Norton products have been on my computer since I first got a computer. If you remember Windows 3.11, you have some idea of how long that is... Up until NAV 2003, I had fairly good results with norton products but after several years of consistantly difficult installation issues and bloat-ware: resource hogging, system slowing annoyances, I cannot, in good faith, recommend Norton products to anyone I might consider a friend again.If you're about to upgrade, don't. Either renew your previous subscription or find a new product that meets or exceeds your expectations. Remember when companies wanted to earn your business?"
1,Doesn't get the job done,"Here's my experience with Norton: It finds a virus, but is often unable to delete it or quarantine it. That makes the product useless to me. I was able to download free antivirus software over the web (AVG) which was able to quickly find viruses, spyware, etc. and ZAP them. Skip Norton."
1,Worthless,"I am uninstalling this from my computer. Not only is the software cumbersome, but it has never once found anything on my computer to correct. The program I was using crashed yesterday, and when I clicked the error message from Microsoft it told me very specifically that I probably had a virus, and even told me which one I had. I ran Norton Antivirus, and, as usual, it found nothing. Norton Antivirus also markets itself as spyware protection, which is a joke. After running Norton to check for the virus, I ran my Ad-Aware spyware detection program and found 76 pieces of spyware. I then ran SpyDoctor and found 25 more. That's 101 pieces of spyware that Norton Antivirus managed to miss, or 101 out of 101, giving it a 0% success rate."
2,Necessary Item,"No one should be without it and at a price better than $10.00 less than local Best Buy and Circuit City it was a necessary bargain. Delivered in a timely fashion, as always. Thanks, Amazon."
1,Forget about Windows Restore,"What a disappointment over version 2005. After installing NAV 2006, my Windows Restore function ceased to work. I uninstalled the NAV 2006 and my Windows Restore is back to normal. Furthermore, the spyware and adware blocker do not work either. I routinely find spyware on my computer by using spybot so I guess NAV 2006 failed to pick them up.What more can I say."
1,Worst Norton AV,"Was using 2003 Version without any problems. Removed 2003/Installed 2006, would not work properly. Removed 2006/Used Nortons tech support web tools to remove and clean all versions/Reinstalled 2006, still would not work properly, did this several times. Ended up using the 2003 after it reinstalled with another year of updates but now must do updates manually because automatic updates shows to update but doesn't. This is terrible product, setting on shelf not using and has already been activated, waste of money. To get live tech support you must pay, why should I pay money to get a product to work I just payed $ to purchase? VERY POOR PRODUCT AND SUPPORT."
2,Sloooow as molasses in the middle of winter!,"Product works, but slowed pc down to a crawl after software was installed. If you're not running a Cray supercomputer with gobs of memory, I would recommend looking for another brand of Antivirus software. Very disappointing, as I have always used Norton products in the past...."
2,please explain for me,"the ad page states that on Amazon, this is among the TOP 5 software titles sold. Very impressive!!! But the user reviews seem to HATE the program. more than half clearly warn : do not buy this program>What is going on??? if it doesn't work, why is everyone buying it??"
1,Worst online support I have ever seen.,"Symantec's so-called customer service website is the most confusing, frustrating, bug-ridden, and unhelpful commercial website I've ever visited. And yes, I've been to Hewlett Packard's."
3,I'll stick with NAV 2003 thank you.......,"After reading all of the horror stories here and elsewhere, I think I am just going to stick with my 2003 version of NAV, even though technical support for it is no longer offered. I would like to upgrade, but do not want the headache, or even the possibility thereof.As a note for anyone considering upgrading to the ""Norton AntiVirus 2006"" electronically (through Norton's user interface) it should be noted that one of the features is ""On-going Protection."" Reading the small print at the bottom of the screen we see that ""On-going Protection"" is actually the following:On-going Protection keeps your computer protected from the latest Internet risks by automatically renewing your subscription at the regular subscription price (plus applicable tax), so you don't have to.So IOW, Norton will now bill your credit card automatically unless you opt out. Uh, no thanks!"
2,"What were they thinking when they wrote this program? A virus is more stable and efficient,","This program is terrible.It locks up,and slows your machine to a crawl,allows viruses and spyware to have a field day,while the norton product decides what should we mess up today.Shall i shut down?demand more money,or find clever ways to charge you for the privledge of putting their program on your computer.You buy!!! you pay and pay and pay.!!!! Dont buy if you expect good customer service.From a kid who got burned!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Problems all around,"This product has not operated properly since the day I got it, despite numerous contacts with Symantec's service department. A key element of the anti-virus protection isn't operating. It has also slowed down everything on my computer, with incredibly long waits just to get the computer to boot up. On top of everything else, they conveniently ""have not received"" my rebate application, leading to more effort to try to get that. I'm just going to consider this a lesson learned, write off the cost, and start again with McAfee."
1,T O T A L N I G H T M A R E !,"iTunes now won't start, Windows itself won't standby or shut down and I am plagued by irritating Norton pop up 'status' messages and flashing system tray icons.Don't buy this product unless you want to bring on a world of PC pain."
2,Where Are The Norton Alternatives? We Need One!!!,"It is unfortunate that Norton is the de facto antivirus because it sucks! It is buggy and causes unsolicited restarts more often than any program I've ever used.The ""Norton Protection Center"" triples startup time and doesn't seem to offer any value over my previous version of NA (2004) which didn't have it.Symantec has never understood that computer utilities should be effective, inconspicuous, and simple to use."
2,Good but slowed my computer down,"Usual quality from Norton as expected, but this new version slows down my computer. It runs too much in the background...that seems to slow down both (fairly new) computers I put it on."
1,I hope it captures viruses after a nightmare installation!,"I have used Norton Anti-virus for many years now. Never had a problem. THIS installation was just awful. After getting several cryptic messages during the installation, my computer just kept rebooting over & over. The only way I was able to fix it was to boot up in Windows ""Safe"" mode. And just try to find an 800 number for the vendor. IF (big IF) I decide to use Norton Anti-virus in 2007, I will go back to the downloadable version -- I don't remember ever having a single problem with that. This version, however -- AVOID it like the plague!"
1,Can only install on a limited number of home computers.,"You can only install Norton Antivirus on a limited number of home computers. It's better to get a product, such Avast! 4 Home Edition that can be installed on an unlimited number of home computers. Symantic is a very customer unfriendly company. When you complain to them about the limited number of installs they want you to send them the original receipt, the cd, and the cd jacket to them. They say they will get back to you in 2-3 weeks. Save yourself the headache of dealing with them. Just go with Avast! 4 Home Edition instead."
2,Norton problems,"My auto update feature on the NAV 2006 ceased functioning in March 2006 and after 2 hours of phone time with service in India, and after 3 separate attempts, I was unable to obtain a fix other than manually download some updates. Now my home computer is having glitches and the auto update program has ceased working. I suspect updates from Microsoft are causing conflicts but Symantec is making no effort to also update its program. I will not by NAV again."
2,"Virus Safe, But Hinders PC","I have used Norton for years. I tried McAfee and had nothing but trouble. Norton always did well for me... until the last two versions.Norton has slowed down my both of my computer a LOT (and they have the resources to use). The few standard features offered were basic & not that customizable.I switched to a new, up & coming brand and all my problems disappeared. My computers are faster, there are no glitches, & I gained a lot of customizable features Norton wanted more money for.Don't just buy this because you have used it in the past. If you have any reservations like I had- take the leap & try something new. You might be as happy as I am!"
1,Terrible Activation and Installation Process,"Tried upgrading from 2005 to 2006, but the activation screen would always freeze before the program could connect to verify. Problem appears to happen quite often when I searched around, but other than making sure all appropriate services and programs were running (and they were) there was no solution. Updating via LIveupdate did not help.EVEN WORSE... when I went back to 2005 the same thing happened, so now both Norton AV 2005 and Norton AV 2006 are useless.Support has been no help.This is a product to stay away from!"
1,NAV 2006 is GOD-AWFUL,"I cannot believe how bad my experiences have been with Norton Antivirus, now 2006. The latest debacle is that something in Norton is preventing my print server and even direct printing to LPT1 from working, I have to shut off the virus ""protection"" in order to print a stupid document, even when bypassing the print server. There is no popup message telling me this is what has happened, but my suspicions have been growing about how bad this program is. It has always caused performance hits on my systems. AVOID NORTON. There are better AV programs out there."
1,Customer Service is an oxymoron,"Bought the 3pack for home use. Installed it on two pc's and then had defective a defective new pc that it was installed on and removed. NOW, it won't let me activate on the new computer - their system is flawed!!!! They want me to mail in original invoice, unlock code and disk and THEN they'll see what they want to do. This will all take at least 2 to 3 weeks, in the meantime there is no protection on this computer. HAAAAA!They really need to have a specific code for each activation so that it updates to the active computer it is being used on - they really could figure this out. They're taking the easy way out and getting more $$$ in the process.This combined with all other slow down issues, I'm switching to ZONE Suite, as I've used Zone Alarm for years and it is great.Best of luck."
1,Norton AV 2006 spells disaster,"Installed NAV 2006 on Professional XP without a problem. On the Home Edition XP, the NAV 2006 completely trashed the operating system beyond repairs. This is the worst quality product I ever came accross in years. To add insult to injury, their technical support matches their product quality, meaning you get none. No self-respecting company should be putting out a trashy quality software like this. It is time to get real and stop buying their products."
1,How to cure Norton,"I have installed, uninstalled, reinstalled more than 6x - closed windows' every foundation program upon recommendation - reinstated everything - communicated with symantec at least a dozen times - and today I found the cure to all Norton problems, it's called McAfee."
1,Defective Product,"If you want a product that asks you to activate each time you boot your computer than tell you you ran out of linceses, directs you to call the friendly support center in India whom will tell you need to buy a new copy, than you'll be very happy with this product."
3,Symantec needs to do better,I had a lot of trouble uninstalling my Norton 2005. It took me roughly 2hrs to put in 2006. It shouldn't be this much of a hassle to go from one Symantec version to the next. 2006 is now in and working fine. I hope they improve their products or next time I will look elsewhere.
2,Trouble with instalation.,"My friend purchased Norton's whole package Cd. I installed it and it kept telling me to download new updates. I did this 3 times(about 2 hrs each time on dial-up line)and nothing happened because it was disconnected each time. I went to my(cable hook-up computer and checked out the Norton site. After research there I found a fix problems tool and clicked it and it fixed the problem and downloaded new updates in about 45 minutes on the dial-up and now it works ok. I have always had Norton and depend on it on my computer. Have had no virus but I still have 2005 addition and keep it updated. After reading reviews and the trouble I had with my friends, I am debating on whether or not to upgrade mine. Maybe if I wait they will come out with a corrected version."
3,"""like new"" may not be really what you want","I bought this toaster and it works fine, but when I got it, it looked liked someone had used it for quite a while before returning it. The plastic was scratched up and the metal on the top where you put the bread in was discolored. It looked like a toaster that had been used for a few months. I was not very happy with the look, but the toaster functions very well."
5,Cuisinart CPT-FR toaster,This is the best toaster we have ever used. Love that it can accomodate various thicknesses and slice sizes. It even looks good on the counter.
1,Do you LOVE burned toast? Then this is the toaster for you!,"I HATE this toaster. Hate. Hate. Hate.The geniuses who designed this thing decided in their infinite wisdom to have the darkness setting reset to the middle default for each new batch of toast.What?! Yes, you heard it right.It generally toasts just fine on ""2,"" but just in case I feel like burning the next batch, it helpfully resets to ""4"" every time you put in a new slice.As you might imagine, I forget about half the time and now have a whole lot of experience with burned toast.(Sigh.) What a way to start the day...I hate this thing so much, I'm tempted to march it down to Elliott Bay and give it the flotation test. I'm writing this because I just burned my last piece of bread, again, and there's as much smoke coming out my ears as there is coming off my toast."
3,It's OK...,The toaster arrived in wonderful condition. It is easy to use. However it does not toast evenly. The top toasts more than the bottom. Even my 4 year old complained about it. I would not buy this toaster again.
1,Died in 1 month,Toaster looked good. But it died in one month after sparking.Lets see how it can be replaced.Pradeep
3,"Good data, but why compare apples to oranges?","This is a very excellent work, with only one flaw; not all children in these cultures are actually in school. Here in the States we are obligated, by law, to educate every child. We cannot be selective and exclude all but the brightest, nor would we want too. My point is, comparing how these cultures educate to our own is apples and oranges. Unless you want to actually model the key to their success, which would require denying millions of children a public education."
3,Good Enough For A Project,"My son bought this online for a British Literature Project. It came out quite well using the set. It is not very difficult to assemble. But some of the pieces are hard to put together and some come apart easily. Overall, it was good enough for the project. But its not a great toy idea for any kid."
1,All the review are correct,"Pieces are hard to get out and break easy. Hard to put the pieces together, and when you do geth them together it is very unsturdy."
2,Terrible,"I purchased this for my 11-year old for a school project. The die cut did not work on several pieces so they broke while punching them out. The instructions are virtually non-existent, other than a basic ""match number one to number one, etc."" The lack of direction caused us to make, tear apart, and re-make several of the elements of this bridge. On a lot of the pieces, the holes/notches were the wrong size and required a LOT of sanding (my fingers are still sore), and once the pieces were together, a lot of them didn't want to stay together (even though the ""instructions"" said glue was not necessary).The finished product, I must say, looks really good, but there is NO WAY my son could have done this. It took me the better part of a full day to put it together. I wouldn't recommend it."
5,Easy way to lose weight and not be hungry,"I love this blender and use it every day. In one month I have lost 8 pounds and a jean size down just by substituting a high fiber fruit smoothie with supplements for my usual breakfast. It keeps me going all morning with increased energy. This is the first time a ""diet"" to lose weight has worked for me. Blender will grind up any food easily, and cleans up very easily. I would recommend it to anyone."
2,A good blender,Vitamix is an overpriced blender. It makes good smoothies. A food processor or chopper is better than than the Vitamix for chopping vegatables. Vegetables have to be cooked before making soup which means it only heats the soup after you have prepared it.As a juicer it is poor. The juice is substandard compared to a vegetable and fruit juicer. You have to add ice and sometimes water which separates if placed in the refrigerator. I much prefer a juicer.
4,A good grinder,"This powerful machine can do many things that other grinding machines cannot do. For example, pineapple juice. However grinding everything into fluid indeed is not good for your digestion system. So do not use this machine to save your chewing. This machine is also quite pricey. Ask youself what you want to do about this machine first before committing to it."
1,Vita mix,"The product did not look like the one displayed. It is all black, not what i ordered. Too much hassel to return it, but disappointed the product was not what was represented.Kay Corsun"
3,Spring for the Top Model,"While this model does a nice job for what it is, I highly recommend that you spend the extra $100 to get the Professional Series 500. YOU ARE GOING TO WANT IT! I had this machine for about three weeks and it just does not give you the control that the professional series does. You are pretty limited with only the high/low settings, so it is impossible not to pulverize your food. If you only want to make smoothies, this machine is incredible. But, if you are not in the smoothie business and you want a great tool that can do a whole lot more (and you have the extra $100) get the professional 500. Trust me on this one!"
2,"Product is OK when working but customer ""service"" is not","We have a Vita Mix, the 5000 which is similar to the 4500, and it has been malfunctioning on and off since the first week. The product is great when it works, but when it doesn't I sure don't feel like it was worth almost $400.Vita Mix customer ""service"" is a joke. The first time we called we were told both ""you aren't using the product correctly"" and ""it is working the way it should"". Hard for me to beleive that a $400 blender should thermally trip off and stay off for 20 minutes when chopping ice or frozen fruit for smoothies --- it's kinda what it was purchased for!The second attempt at ""service"" we were told that the drive gear was probably bad, they would ship the part and I would have to replace it. I was told I could NOT return the item until this had been tried. Again, for $400, I don't expect to be servicing my own appliances."
3,doesn't change your life,"I have owned this for over a year now, and despite all the rah rah rah, it is just a blender. It is a good blender but it will do for you what any other blender will do. Kitchen aid has better attachments for most anything you would want to attach, and most people own a kitchen aid so you would probably put an attachment on that instead of the vita-mix. Also this model doesn't have a variable speed so its either high/low, on/off. Well made but it can still get stuck with a lot of frozen berries etc..."
5,OMG!!!,"I remember in the past,wanting one, but not buying a Vita-Mix because someone who reviewed it called it an over priced blender. While yes it is expensive, I absolutely recommend this product!! Especially if you are into juicing your veggies and fruit, and want to keep the pulp in the mix. I just packed this thing w/greens, veggies, and fruit, and had a smoothie in under a minute! I could never get the same results w/a traditional blender, and believe me, I've gone through a few. I almost gave up on blending all together and just stuck to straight juicing. So glad I made the decision to buy this blender. So while yes it was expensive, seems so worth the extra $$$ just after the first use. I'm very impressed;)"
5,Turbo 4500,"The TurboBlend 4500 is a 2-speed (high and low) machine. The Vitamix 5000 is a (high and variable) speed machine. The variable speed dial on the Vitamix 5200 enables the user to adjust to a slower blending speed than the TurboBlend 4500. Both machines have a 2+ peak hp motor.The TurboBlend 4500 is sold through Retail Dealers and the Vitamix 5200 is sold directly through Vitamix.The two Vitamix models 5000 and Super 5000 have a center variable speed dial, which I feel is not worth the price.The variable speed is seldom used! Even in their own manual,Vita-Mix gives this recipe for smoothies:""Select variable speed #1. Turn on machine and quickly increase speed to #10; then to High. Run for 1 minute until smooth.""Well, that's the same as flipping the 4500 switch from low to high. When you flip the 5000 to high, the variable switch is no longer active.Why pay $75 more to turn a dial? I'm happy to flip a switch up."
5,excellent product,"We were hesitant to pay hundreds for a blender but now that I have it, I dont know how I ever lived without it. It has been a wonderful addition to my eating habits and breaks down the cellulose of greens to make them more absorbable to the body.It goes great with a book called green for life which explains all the great benifits of green smoothies. If you were to start this program, health would improve almost instantly! I am now getting allot more vitimins and minerals from my food than I used to, it keeps me on a raw food diet and is also good for soups. If theres something that my food processor cant do, the vita-mix can! I use it at every given oppertunity and makes great smoothies of any kind, even if you are not a raw foodist."
3,Nice try but....,This book read like following a pinball machine! Not mention it was in much need of editing. The storyline started off with good intentions but....much was lacking due to the story bouncing around from one character to another as well as one subject to another.
2,DID NOT LAST,"I ORDERED THIS FOR MY SON'S 6TH BIRTHDAY. HIS BIRTHDAY WAS JUST LAST MONTH AND IT HAS ALREADY TORN UP. THE ZIPPER CAME COMPLETLY OUT. MAYBE THAT WAS JUST A FLUKE THING-I KNOW THESE THINGS HAPPEN. THIS ITEM IS OK AS FAR AS KEEPING THE TRAIN SYSTEM STRAIGHT, BUT I WAS AGGRAVATED THAT HE HAD TWO PIECES OF TRACK THAT WOULD NOT FIT IN THE ORGANIZER. YOU WOULD THINK THEY WOULD MAKE IT TO HOLD ALL PIECES. SO WE HAD NO WHERE TO PUT THE OTHER 2 (HE HAS THE DOUBLE DECKER EXPRESS SET). I RATED IT BAD BECAUSE OF THAT AND THE FACT THAT THE ZIPPER TORE UP SO QUICKLY. I AM PLANNING ON JUST GETTING A RUBBERMAID CONTAINER FOR ALL OF THE BIGGER PEICES AND PUTTING ALL OF THE SMALLER PIECES IN A PENCIL POUCH."
1,tralee boot,Clarks are always comfortable! However these looked kinda' silly. My foot is narrow and just barely slid into the boot. I could deal with that. The boot itself looked funny on my legs. My calfs are actually average size but the boot bloused out to much. It just doesn't work.
2,Not enough range,"We have had this is 2 different houses now, and it constantly sends of the 'out of range' signal with the slightest interference, such as someone walking down the hallway. Also, it has battery backup for the receiver but not the intercom. When we lost power, we had to bring the little one into bed with us. It also does not have an on/off switch on the intercom, so if you want to turn it off during the day, you have to unplug it. We've regretted this purchase."
5,I LOVE THIS MONITOR!,"I highly recommend buying this monitor. I originally had a hand-me-down monitor from my sister and I couldn't stand the static any longer! I reviewed the monitors on this website and trusted the other reviews and went out and bought this one. I now see why it has 5 stars! When I first turned it on I thought it wasn't working because I didn't hear anything, it is that quiet! I no longer have to bother my baby by going into his room to check on him because I can hear everything from this monitor! A+"
1,No range,"Yep, same problem here with the dang thing beeping all the time. I live in a one story 1800 sq ft house. I can step out the back door on the patio or my front door, and the out-of-range alarm starts up right away. I can faintly hear my babies sounds around the alarm but sporatically. Now I'm shopping for a better one. Don't waste your money."
2,Good features -- but annoying problem!,"Clarity is good.Voice Activated option is a great feature.BUT, that annoying ""out of range"" alarm keeps beeping.I'll pick the monitor up in order to turn it down so as not to wake my hubby... and it beeps. I walk across the room on the way to feed baby... and it beeps. Who knows how often it beeps (and wakes my husband) when I'm in the nursery. My baby's room isn't far from mine and I've tried numerous locations for both the receiver and the monitor -- but nothing works! It's VERY annoying and I plan to return it."
3,very annoying,"Ok, so it picks up every little sound the baby makes, which can be good or bad (if you're trying to sleep at night, don't use the sound activated option....you wake up every time it goes off and it goes off for every little sound). What I REALLY hate about this thing is it beeps very loudly whenever there is interference, and there is ALWAYS interference, no matter how many times you change the channel. It wakes me up at least 2 or 3 times a night. Does everyone else have this problem???"
3,"Good sometimes, hate the range!","I bought this after reading several great reviews. Well it does pick up breathing and doors opening and everything else, BUT it beeps randomly all the time and it has NO range. My neighbor 2 doors down has a $20 fisher price one and she can hear everything if she brings it over. If I go even half way to her house with mine, all I hear is the out of range alarm! It is very annoying! I would go with a different brand."
1,Can't Sleep,"Save your money and try another monitor. I have had this monitor since the birth of my child in 2004. It worked fine (not great) for almost a year. Then the out of range alarm beeps all times even if I was in the next room. I tried changing the channels several times and nothing works. It drives me crazy the speaker makes a clicking sound along with the beeping of the out of range indicator. I am in the process of looking for another monitor before I loose my mind. I read that The First Years Safe & Sound 3808, The First Years Crisp & Clear Plus 3813B and Evenflo Constant Care 3000 rated really well by Consumers."
1,Save your money,"Such a disappointment with Sony! This monitor never stops beeping; supposedly, this is only supposed to happen if it is out of range or low on battery, but to us, it happened more often than not. When it worked, the reception was very clear, but when it didn't, how very annoying! Save your money; Sony has some changes to make!"
1,Lousy monitor.,"I bought this monitor for our 6 month old twins based on the great reviews and found it to be lousy. Picks up too much interference, our phonecalls are broadcast over the receiver and it doesn't always pick up sounds from the room. It also makes periodic beeping noises.We bought a 900mhz Attachable Monitor from First Years to monitor our then 2 year old, and a year and a half later it is still working great. Looks like we'll be buying another one to replace the still new (and overpriced) Sony model."
1,Out of range alarm sounds all of the time,"After reading all of the monitor reviews, I decided that the sony monitor sounded like the best one. It really is clear and does have pretty good range. But the out of range alarm sounds randomly but consistently. We have tried changing the channels but nothing works. It woke us up several times and we finally had to just turn it off. I do not recommend this monitor. If only they allowed you to turn off the out of range feature, then we would be happy."
5,LOVE IT!,"We bought this as a second monitor for our older child because someone else in our area was coming through on her other one. (hearing someone elses child on your monitor at 2am is freaky!!)We went with the sony because it has more channels than others and was resonably priced. We have not had a problem with it at all. No static, No interference and it comes in very clear. We also have another monitor in our house that is on at the same time for my son and have not had any interference from that one either (that one is a different brand though.)"
5,GREAT Monitor!,We bought this monitor for our newborns. It works great! There is never any static and the sound quailty is crystal clear. We bought the Fisher Price Lights and Sounds monitor prior to this one and it was full of static and different converstations from people in the neighborhood. I recommend the Sony monitor to anyone.
2,Not intended for apartments,"My husband and i recieved this monitor as a gift from a friend. The monitor is very clear and picks up our sons noises very well. The only complaints that we have is that we live on the third floor of an apartment building and this monitor picks up everybodies phone conversations. It also picks up other signals and makes an awful noise, which is horrible if its the middle of the night. We are both heavy sleepers, so we keep the volume all the way up at night, and there have been times where the monitor as picked up a signal and woke our son. I definitly would not buy this for an apartment."
1,terrible after 3 1/2 months,"Sony - must be a good product! Well I chose this monitor for our shower list after reading all the reviews of all the monitors sold at Babies r us. I was extremely pleased at first. Then one night when my son was 3 1/3 months old at 3am the thing went crazy. Scared us to death! The noise that came out of it was so loud I'm surprised my children were not awaken. We tried everything to fix the problem, all the different channels, changed the batteries (even though it was plugged in when this happened)and nothing worked. It should be returned - needless to say I no longer have the box.Your monitor is one of the most important accessories you need. Although I realize 40 bucks is not alot of money - I do think that the product should last beyond 3-4 months! The product worked well while it lasted, but it didn't last long!!"
3,OK Monitor...,"Bought this because of the great reviews, but haven't been greatly impressed. There are two reasons I am not thrilled with the product:1. The voice activated feature doesn't work correctly. It still picks up other noise (ie. music (without voices) and her mobile.) It also doesn't always pick up her voice.2. The monitor picks up other people's monitors when outside."
1,Hope you don't mind NO PRIVACY,"In order for a cordless monitor to have any privacy, you need it to be digital and use digital-spread-spectrum (DSS) technology. 900 Mhz is the best frequency for a baby monitor, though. Here's why: It is important for people to know that if you have a wireless network in your house, that it cannot share the same frequencies at any other 2.4 Ghz devices. This includes baby monitors and cordless telephones. The correct arrangement should be:Baby Monitor: 900 Mhz Digital-Spread-Spectrum (DSS)WiFi Netowrk: 2.4 GhzCordless Telephone: 5.8 Ghz Digital-Spread-Spectrum (DSS)"
1,Not worth the money,"We had the First Years Peace of Mind monitor that we bought on Ebay, however every now and then it would make a loud static noise (NOT constant static). I read the reviews of lots of baby monitors and they all recommended the Sony Baby Call so we thought it would be wonderful. It works great during the day with no extra noise, but at night the out of range alarm goes off all the time with a horrific beeping noise. Our baby is just down the hall, maybe 30 feet away. That's a lot closer than the 400 feet that the monitor is supposed to be able to be away from the transmitter. I would not recommend this monitor to anyone, save your money and get something else."
1,Too much interference!,"This monitor makes a VERY loud noise when there is local interference, which is a lot of the time. I have tried all the different settings and they all have the same problem. It is not just static, it is a LOUD annoying noise that comes through, waking the baby or making me turn it off so that I just have to listen for her. Do not buy this monitor."
1,Extremely disappointed,"I wish my experience of this monitor was similar to the majority of reviewers, but alas, I can't stand the thing. I bought because it was a Sony, but I've been woefully disappointed. It beeps randomly for no reason, the range alarm starts going nuts after it has been fine for hours, and sometimes it makes a buzzing sound similar to a phone ringing. Today was the final straw when I put my baby down for a nap, brought the monitor outside with me, and when I came in I found my baby screaming his head off while the monitor stood silent. It wasn't until I was within 20 feet of the baby that the monitor picked it up. I'm done with it."
4,Works well,"This monitor has worked great for us with only one complaint -- lots of interference. The monitor is super sensitive(I often turn it up just to hear my daughter breathing) and can pick up noises even if placed on the dresser more than a foot away from the crib. I have also enjoyed the ability to recharge the portable part. It is great to just plug it in and still use it while charging. My only complaint is unexplained interference -- lots of beeps or static. Yes, the phone or my husband's optical mouse will affect it but other times it just beeps inexplicably. Otherwise, I have been very happy with this monitor."
1,Sony Monitor,"THIS MONITOR IS ALWAYS OUT OF RANGE!! It beeps really loudly whenever I walk past it or touch it. We have changed the channels 100 times to no avail. Thank goodness it was a baby shower gift, or I would be really mad!"
5,LOVE IT,"We love this product...it is well worth the price!!! Very clear and blocks out all the other sounds (i.e. humidifier running, rain or thunder). LOVE IT!"
3,What is all the beeping!!??,"I am giving this three stars because it has really clear sound - I tested it with a radio in my daughter's room, and on the monitor in our room 50 feet away it sounded as clear as the actual radio.BUT - and this is why I returned it - the range alarm beeps randomly! I tried changing the channels, and still the same thing. If someone walks near the baby-end of the monitor it beeps, and if someone walks near the parent end it beeps. It also seems to go off for no reason. Frustrating, especially in the middle of the night!So.... although the sound was crystal clear (and does not interfere with the Fisher price sound n lights for our son) it went back to the store!"
2,A warning,"I too bought the Sony Baby Call based on reviews, because my Graaco monitor had such a poor battery life and was loud. The good news about Sony is that the battery lasts a good long time. The bad news (and there is a lot) is that the range is very poor. I can't get the mail from the box without the range alarm going off. Worse still is the sounds it makes. The monitoring sound is very quiet, but it often emits a random beeping noise or a sudden loud static clatter which can wake me up. Maybe because our small bedroom has a fair share of electronics in it (TV/VCR, phone & clock radio) but it's constantly burbling and beeping, even when we try placing it at different places in the room. Last night the static woke up our child, it was so loud. I'm back on the baby monitor search."
2,Remember the movie Signs?,"Do you remember the movie Signs, where Mel Gibson's family stands by while the Earth is invaded by alien creatures and long before they could be seen, alien chat could be heard over cheap walkie-talkies? Well, this is not too far from the type of sounds and static you easily pick up with these monitors.It must be said that this doesn't take away from their ability to do their job when the baby begins to cry in his room at night, since most of the static I've heard through the receiver goes on during the day. Actually, beside putting out sound, they also light up with a column of red lights -LEDs- up to a level proportional to how loud the baby is being, in case you turned down the volume, for whatever reason (to get rid of the static, for example!), which is quite a nice feature. But the static this monitor picks up really is a turnoff: I wouldn't recommend this little piece of gear from Sony. This time, I am sorry I can't provide a better alternative."
1,Horrible loud noises,I can not reccomend this item. I like sony products but this is the worst item I ever purchased from them. The monitor makes loud interference noises all through the day & night causing us to turn it off. It is useless. I just hope babies r us will take it back without the box.
1,Worst monitor ever!!!,Makes a horrible noise all day and night. Worst sony product I have ever purchased!!
3,A lot of static,"I'm not trying to be negative because it seems a lot of people have very good luck with this monitor but... we have had this monitor for 2 years, we chose it because of it's name and reputation but we have really struggled with it the entire time- I have no reason why we never took it back, but we get constant loud background noise and static- if you turn it down so you can't hear the static then we can't hear our daughter... I wouldn't buy this model again."
2,Beeps for no reason,"We registered for these monitors and thought they were ok at first. Sound was good and you can filter out any outside noise. Turns out they make noise (beeping sounds) for no reason at all! Quite frustrating when it's so loud that you worry it will wake the baby in the next room. There's no rhyme or reason for the noises. We've changed channels, tried everything but it still happens randomly. If I still had the box they came in, they would be returned."
1,Not worth the hassle,"I bought this monitor based on the fact that it had good reviews. We initially bought one and it beeped a lot so we returned it for another one thinking we may have gotten a bad monitor. The second one we got was even worse. We have a 1200 square foot aprtment on one level, so its not like our place is huge. The beeping was beyone annoying - waking you up in the middle of the night ,- just what a new mother needs. It does not work in our garage either, which is right downstairs."
5,Great Monitor!,We chose this monitor after extensive research. It is great! We can hear everything in the baby's room and the voice activated feature is nice at night and good for conserving the battery. Would highly recommend this!
4,Good Monitor,"I started off with a cheap fisher price sounds and lights monitor-and they were terrivle and very staticy. This monitor is SO MUCH BETTER! I dont have any static, the only reason it got 4 stars instead of 5 is the range, I live in 2000sq foot home and all the bedrooms are in a line on one side of the house-the babies being the first room ,our other child is the middle room, and ours is last, and in between the middle room and ours is a bathroom. well if I put the monitor in a place that is in line with an object in another room...ex:toy box, person standing/sitting etc...the range alarm goes off no matter what channel it is on...it gets kind of annoying...but still a great monitor"
1,Disappointed with a Sony product,"After reading so many positive reviews of the Sony Baby Call monitor (9 channel) I was surprised that the monitor performed so poorly in my household. The monitor had a constant buzzing/static sound, even after trying the suggestions of the troubleshooting section of the instruction manual. I woke up several times during the night not sure of my son's condition because I couldn't hear him over the static. I returned the monitor the next day and bought a Fisher-Price 900MHz long range monitor for less money and have been very satisfied."
1,Please take it back!!!,"I rarely write reviews of products but this monitor was so bad that I just had to. I purchased this monitor because of the excellent reviews and because of the 9 channels it offered. (I was hoping that the extra channels would help with interference with my other child's monitor.)The ""out of range"" indicator beeped constantly- even when I was just downstairs. It made an awful noise every time we used the phone regardless of where we were or what channel we were on. It woke us all up at all hours of the night- not that I'm sleeping much anyway. I am so frustrated. I can't wait to get it back to the manufacturer!"
2,unacceptable range and annoying beeping,"When you are a sleep deprived parent, the last thing you want is something other that your baby waking you up in the middle of the night. But that is precisely what this product does.We live in an apartment building and our baby's room is right next door to ours. However the out-of-range beeps come on randomly, and the monitor picks up static from phones from other apartments waking us up at random times during the night. It is consistently waking us up and is a major annoyance. Switching channels does not help. I have not tried any other baby monitors yet, but I can tell you this much -- Stay away from this specific Sony model.I do have to say though that the voice-activated feature is very nice, so if you do find it on another baby monitor get it."
5,Variety in the Jungle,"This album contains a diverse set of rhythms and flows. The variety keeps you entertained throughout the entire cd. The songs range from: ones that make you want move with their sounds and experience their concerts, thought provoking reality checks, and the drive of life ambitions. There is a momentum to AML that lets you know they are going somewhere and they are willing to be unconventional to make it big."
3,tough times,This is seems to be a transition album for Maclean and is not of his own label. The sad and questioning tracks give a sense of searching. Star man left me with with a wondering feeling for a confused soul. The high point is a great version of 'Farewell to Whiskey' the traditional Neil Gow tune.
4,Interactive viewing of 200 art titles.,"I used this to supplement a high school art appreciation course that I taught. It allows interactive viewing for you or your students, in the classroom or at home."
2,Didn't work in my printer,I'm sure this would've been a good product had it worked in my printer. Apparently it's only compatible with printers that can handle such small paper.
3,Very thin plastic molds,"The mold is cute enough, but there was virtually no description on the amazon product page, so I won't be able to use them as I was planning to make isomalt candy, which is basically a hard candy. On the back of the package, it says they are for use (only) with Wilton candy melts and are not designed for making hard candy or soap. I'm assuming that the microwave is also a no-no.If you used the candy melts, it would be a good project to do with a kid."
2,Wilton star candy mold,"These molds are fun to make chocolate with the kids, but wilton should come up with a better quality product. Even those disposable fruit cups are better quality than this. I don't know what this is made of--something resembling spring water bottle plastic, clear, sharp, and brittle. I doubt this can be washed and reusable as it is claimed to be. By the way, it is not dishwasher safe. For food contact products, especially for food frequently consumed by kids, the type of plastic and its safety profile should be clearly labeled. It should at the very minimum have a recycle code on it once it breaks and it will. Also it is very frustrating to remove the packaging--there are FOUR staples on it. After the staples are finally off, you are holding a piece of plastic with eight holes in it, which feels very uncomfortable to the touch. Wilton should pay more attention to product materials and packaging design, even if it is just a candy mold."
5,Great Collection,A great collection. My wife saw one of the features on a special and we have been waiting for the set.
4,Very good for fans of the show,"If you liked the old TV show, you'll love this DVD set, since these four TV movies haven't been available for years. ""South by Southwest"" and ""Celtic Riddle"" are excellent and are the best of the bunch. The main reasons they are great: Money was spent on the production and there are action scenes, and some real drama along the way. The other two movies -- ""A Story to Die For"" and ""Last Free Man"" -- are talky, have no co-stars (even from the show's traditional ""B"" and ""C"" lists) and must have been produced on a shoe-string budget; they take place almost entirely indoors. But it's all vintage ""Murder, She Wrote"" and die-hard fans will cherish having four 90-minute episodes to watch on Sunday nights."
2,Loved Murder She Wrote but these stories were redundant,"As A Murder She Wrote fan, I was looking forward to seeing some episodes I hadn't aready viewed and was thinking the longer show would give room for a good mystery. I was so dissapointed to discover all four of these episodes were too much like other episodes, not very well written mysteries, not well directed, and had little to do with the characterizations of Jess Fletcher or any anyone else. VERY TWO DIMENSIONAL. And to top it off, it was very clear Angela Landsbury's heart was just not in it. After all those years, who could blame her?I would have rated this one star, but since it was Angela Landsbury, I just couldn't."
5,Granddaughter's favorite Series,"I bought it for my 19 year-old granddaughter, who has been a fan since we bought a couple of the TV series 5 years ago. She loved these full length movies, too."
3,Not as good as the show.,"I really like Murder She Wrote and Angela Lansbury so it pains me to say these movies are just okay. The production is poor, everyone looks a bit haggard. One of the movies in particular is pretty dumb, JB Fletcher as her slave owning ancestor in flashbacks was very cheesy. The one that takes place on a train was my favorite. After watching all of the TV show on Netflix it was a pleasant surprise to find these movies but only a die hard fan will probably enjoy them."
2,Too slow.,It was disappointing.after having owned all of her sets. It just doesn't have the flow the others have. Retiement is good.
5,Wonderful Movies,These 4 films that followed the beloved Murder She Wrote series staring the wonderful Angela Lansbury are just great and fun to watch. They are 1 1/2 hours long so there is more time than the TV show to develop the mystery and the scenery in each film is beautiful (the cinematography for these 4 films feels more like a big budget movie than a TV show). Angela Lansbury is her charming self and really carries these films. I have watched them over and over again. They are great for a Saturday night at home or on a rainy Sunday when you're just sitting around the house. They are family friendly and very enjoyable.
2,A rehash of his previous books - don't bother with this one,"I expected more from this book given I own P. Allen Smith's previously published books P.Allen Smith's Garden Home and Container Gardens. But this book gave no additional information that wasn't already written in his other books. In addition, some of the photos were also repeated from his previously published books. Lack of information on how to mix and match colors in plantings made this book worthless. Basically what this book is, is just an encylopedia of plants categorized by color. I expected more!"
3,"Fairly easy to use, but only lasts a year","This program makes it pretty easy to prepare bulk mailings. But if that's the main reason you're buying it, you need to know that you'll need to buy it again every year. The zip-sorting data needs to be updated each year, and the program won't allow you to process a bulk mailing if it's been more than a year since your last update. And the ""update"" actually consists of buying the program all over again. It works fine, but you need to know what you're getting into."
3,Good but need more work,The program does as promised but does not allow enough flexibility in allowing you to select what you want to print. You can select all or individual items to print but not a range or grouping of selected items.
3,BARCODE Expires in May 2011,"I've been using MYMAILLIST for 15 years with success. However, the USPS (Post Office) is expiring the POSTNET Barcoding method beginning May of 2011. I've been trying to contact MYMAILLIST/AVANQUEST, however, they don't seem to be aware of this issue. If you are purchasing this software to create Bulk Mailings, DO NOT BUY IT unless the company addresses this issue."
2,Very mechanical,"So you want to learn about testing your Perl programs? This book will teach the mechanics of how to use the test frameworks. However it will not teach you a thing about what to test and why. The examples given all test stuff that a child could verify as correct - things so trivial that writing a test for them becomes an exercise in wasting your time. There isn't a bit of sage advice here on where a test is really useful and why, no tips and tricks, no pitfalls or warnings. A glorified manpage."
5,whistful and disturbing,"Despite its title, this is not a ""girls gone wild"" in hardcover, but rather a series of thoughtful portraits about the desperate and sad reality behind the drunken revelry of spring break. Welch's photos are stark and honest without being lurid or judgmental. The book really captures the whole profane youth culture that is informed more by beer ads and porn films than anything else. Welch is a top-flight photographer and this book highlights his talents to a great degree."
1,A Very Lame Book,"This is a book of pictures of jocks and women who dig them, getting hammered.""Yet Welch accepts, and even embraces, these raunchy rituals of extreme adolescence, alloing [sic] a strange sense of sadness to pervade. The morning after, broken spirits are left to reflect on their senseless acts, pack their bags, and head home....yeah, right. So why on earth would anyone want a book full of this? ""Strange sense of sadness..."" sounds like a fancy term for pathetic.Don't waste your money on this book."
2,Riding off,"The fourth and final studio album. I think Sniff n' the Tears fans stuck around this long because it was clear Paul Roberts was an extremely talented individual, and what we'd seen before was only scratching the surface of what could be. But we didn't find out here. While ""Hungry Eyes"" and the title track were certainly highlights in the Sniff n' the Tears catalog, the rest of ""Ride Blue Divide"" was a trip down a road we'd seen before...and there wasn't anything new to write home about."
3,Safety First,"Review should be FIVE STARS: Nine of my classmates have been killed in ""side-of-the-road"" accidents; hit by drunks and soccer moms while changing a tire, after a fender bender, or when switching drivers. When you break down, get fully off at an exit, or, if you're unable, set out your triangles at 100 and 50 feet. Every car should have a set. I bought three sets after my teen's boyfriend ran out of gas and pulled over in the fast lane on a highway, with nothing but his worn out flashers to warn oncoming traffic. He got a lecture and a set and my daughter's cars get the others. Northern Tool seems to be the Best Buy, unless you can find them at a highway truck stop for about the same money. Don't waste your time; buy from Northern tool and Amazon."
4,"Sturdy triangles, flimsy box","This set of three triangles is a very useful must-have in all automobiles. The triangles themselves seem pretty sturdy and compact. The base appears to be heavy enough to support the triangle out in the open. The box is a little flimsy though, especially in the latches that secure the lid in place. It could also use a handle for easy lifting. However, this is a minor issue for an item that is hopefully going to spend most (if not all) its life in the back of your car!"
4,Very Pleased with purchase,My purchase arrived sooner than I thought it would and I very happy with my purchase and will buy from this retailer again.
2,Sand and Sable,I was really upset with the late arrival of my product. I wish it could of came on time and that it could be better packaged.
3,"Good game, and almost unheard?","Really this is a hidden gem in the world of the Sega Genesis! Great graphics, and I swear it has twice as much color variations as games today! Its kind of part adventure, part shooter, and part strategy at times! The music is really cheesy but also really catchy and at times it meshes perfectly with the enemies and worlds you travel through!I'm still a little shocked that I could find this game on Amazon, I think I've only seen it once and that was in this dark shady movie rental place that had 60% B-movies, it was a weird little store but it had some unique games in it like this one!"
1,Questioning the authenticity,"The Hylyt Bath Oil I bought came from Entirely Pets, and I do not recommend it.I still had a bottle of this oil that I purchased from my vet. The content of the bottles I bought here was not the same. The scent was different, and it was not as oily. The bottles looked the same, but I am leary that the ingrediants are the same. Also, the bottle I purchased from the vet, did NOT have an expiration date stamped on the bottom, but these did, and they had expired a month before I received them. That too was interesting. Buyer be ware."
5,Vincent - An Early 20th Century Poet Defined,"This portrayal of Edna St. Vincent Millay is not only a solid biography, but a finely crafted novel in itself. Bringing you through her artistically bohemian childhood through to her wildly aware college years and beyond, this is a book filled with a most vivid depiction of the poet's life while attempting to recreate her views of growing up on the east coast in Penobscot and attending school at Vassar. I would suggest it to anyone who enjoys biographies, literature, Millay's work, or early 20th century history."
2,NOT AS GOOD AS IT LOOKS LIKE,"It's not about the cover, but what it contains... I've spent 3 months in a hospital after I have been attacked by GRACIE JIU JITSU practioners in my own school. So I decided to spend some months (7 to be accurate) practicing JEET KUNE DO. Than those guys wanted to fight with me again and I got beaten up once more. I got pretty scared by knowing that Bruce Lee's art doesn't work ! So I decided to learn the TRADITIONAL STYLES of ASIAN FIGHTING ARTS. I read this book: It's cool you know ... but its utility is more historical than practional. The practional part doesn't work in real life. In a word this book quite DISSAPOITING."
4,"Highly recommend, and Defence is NOT mis-spelled!","I am a martial artist of 20 years, and found this book to be a source of information and inspiration. I highly recommend it. Also, as a side note, the words ""Defence"" and ""Practise"" and others are not misspellings. The book was published in the U.K. (England) and these are the correct spellings there. I believe it is Americans who butchered the spellings!"
5,I wish I could give this book more then 5 stars...,"I bought this book to learn about Meditation, the Shaolin Way of Life, Kungfu itself, all SORTS of things. I read it over a very long period of time, reading it chapter by chapter. This is likely the best way of learning al you can from this book.Read chapter 1, ponder it, do any kinda training sessions it describes. Then do the same thing with all the rest of the chapters.This is the BEST book I ever recommend to ANYONE who cannot find a teacher that is worth their money.. JUST A TIP, treat the book like a teacher. Respect it, don't question it, do exactly as it tells you to. If you do, I am sure you will learn a LOT."
5,VERY GOOD!,"This is perhaps one of the best kung fu books you can buy!For a lone practitioner, it is a great ""manual"" for developing your Kung Fu training and objectives.Well pleased."
4,Very useful,"I'm currently studying Kung Fu and Chi Kung in a Shaolin Temple school in Henan Province, China, but because of the language barrier, I didn't get a proper introduction into the history and the philosophy of the martial art. No one speaks English here, or at least not enough to guide me through this sophisticated system. This is where the book came in handy. It put everything in context and provided the orientation I needed before plunging myself into this new world.The author Wong Kiew Kit -- a warrior monk himself -- doesn't beat around the bush, and reading his work is helping me cultivate a lot of passion for the art.I'm definitely buying more books for him, particularly on internal arts, like Tai Chi and Chi Kung."
3,Not the band from New Orleans,This is NOT the band from New Orleans ! This is a younger band from the U.K.All you have to do is look at the peoples names to see the difference .[...]
1,"Poor quality, low volume, short life.","I got this cute mini portable speaker thinking it was rather low cost and convent, I was totally wrong.First, I had to buy 4 AAA batteries, which was a lot of power for such a tiny speaker. Then I found out that if I did not remove the batteries after each use they would leak acid.The volume was very low, even with my S9 (an audio player) volume turned up to max the volume was nominal at best. It almost felt like the speakers could not handle the load.That turned out to be real, one speaker died after a month, then the other. The plastic that the tunit was made out of was break off into small pieces, it didn't last even 2 months.This is just not worth the money and is not convent in any way. I got an iLuv speaker case afterwards, which only needed 2 AA batteries and didn't leak, had much stronger sound and same cost and much happier with it."
2,JUNK,"Zero bass, it cracks with any needed volume. You will get less than you pay for with this speaker. It is a cute idea but bad, unclear, noisy sound.12/21 slight upgrade from 1 to 2 stars. If you change the batteries VERY often, then the sound is pretty good..."
5,"the most comfortable ""sock-less"" footwear I have ever owned","I have several pair of shoes that don't need socks like loafers, crocs, etc but all of them give me blisters just above my heels. Even expensive ones like Bally loafers gives me blisters. This Sanuk however is exceptionally comfortable in every way. I love these shoes... err I mean ""footwear"" (These are not shoes, remember?) ;p"
5,Bryon Kest's Sweat,"I have been looking for a workout that I can do at home for a long time that makes me hurt just enough to know that I got a good workout. I've ordered Yoga tapes that are way too easy and felt like I wasted my money. This is the very best Yoga video I have ever bought. I tried it the first day and thought that it was crazy, and that I could never do any of these poses. The next morning I was aching; it felt awesome. I've done this video everyday since, as well some other cardiovascular stuff. I feel that I am finally getting into good shape. I give this tape an A+!!"
1,Qualified Teacher?,"This year I have purchased half a dozen yoga videos and borrowed even more from the library. This was the worst video - I hope nobody has hurt themselves doing it. If you are strong and healthy already and want something besides weights and stretching -- this would be ok, but I wouldn't really call it yoga. Videos I do recommend? Total Yoga with Tracey Rich is a great, balanced hour long session. David Swenson's Ashtanga Short forms offers three sessions on one tape (15/30/45 minute). I can't decide which is better. If you are new to Ashtanga/Power/Vinyasa Yoga then Power Yoga (stamina version) with Rodney Yee is good. (the only one my Mom can do). If you are experienced -- move on to David Swenson's Ashtanga First Series. No matter what video's you choose -- taking classes with qualified teachers makes all the difference in the world."
1,California-Speak,"You'll love this video if you fancy glistening sinewy bodies who can perform floating motions. You'll also be treated to profundities similar to ""Where you are is where you are. And where you are is perfect because that is where you are."""
1,Never Used It,"I bought the tape and watched it but thought the instructor was more into posing for the camera. It turned me off so much that I never actually used the tape. Frustrated, I bought the Ali McGraw tape. That turned out to be great!"
2,Fabio's Yoga,This is not a video for a Yoga beginner...very difficult to follow and Bryan Kest is very annoying as a teacher...that is if you are into the whole Fabio thing.
4,A great workout,"I really like these video's of Bryan's. I have never been the type to workout at home to a video, but I have stuck with these for months now. I really feel challenged and sweat quite a bit. Afterwards I feel relaxed and grounded. And Bryan is not too new-agy and metaphysical, but he gets to the heart of what this particular yoga practice is about. I have had neck and low back problems for years and this yoga really helps keep me strong and injury-free. I do recommend that the viewer be at least a little experienced with a few classes under his or her belt."
4,Power Yoga II,"Very user friendly full body workout. The instructor talks us through each pose, including breathing, head and neck position and level of intensity. I am in very good condition and I work up a sweat."
1,"Glossy production values, unskilled instructor","The production values of this tape are quite high. I like the warehouse setting, the advanced level of the practitioners - BUT that doesn't hide the fact that I don't think Bryan Kest knows much about yoga, and he's certainly not an advanced practitioner himself!Look closely at the editing of this tape. When Mr. Kest is demonstrating a pose, you see a mere flash of it, usually not at full extension, and often showing sloppy form. Most of the time he walks around and coaches without providing much information about the poses.Now look at his posture and body carriage. Advanced practitioners of yoga carry themselves in a natural mountain pose - they've practiced it so much that perfect posture is second nature. Bryan Kest has terrible posture. This is a dead giveaway that he either practices ignorantly or not at all.In short, I don't think much of him. Try the Yoga Journal series - much better instruction by real yoga instructors."
5,GREAT VIDEO,I have been doing Yoga for about 8 months and was hesitant to buy this tape because of one of the reviews. It is a great tape. I love it. It is challenging and I love that. I feel like he really wants you to do well.
4,Replacement keyboard delivered quickly,This replacement keyboard was perfect. Delivery was really fast. I had to find installation instructions online; none were supplied. My local PC shop installed it for me quickly and pretty cheaply.
3,Could have been better,"First, let me say I've read both reviews...I liked this book, but agree with second reviewer on lapses in style.I think this will make a good series when the characters are allowed to develop.I'll read more Sloan. She's pretty good."
5,Stunning,"Like the title says - STUNNING. I think ""Drum Bum"" meant TOO much sounding like Dylan, hence the 4 stars not TO."
1,RIP OFF ALERT: THESE ARE DUBBED RERELEASES UNDER NEW NAMES,"Do NOT order this if you are a serious Jet Li fan. The films are simply repackaged classics, and to add insult to injury; they are all DUBBED.Take a stand against this type of opportunistic crap; it belittles a great genre and great artists.Do not order this collection.I dont hold anything against Amazon.com for selling it, I only hope they will make it clear to whomever they purchase it from that this doesnt fly and their customers are not having it.-Jason Storm"
5,4 of Jet Li's best!,"This collection includes Fist of Legend, The Enforcer, Twin Warriors, and Defender. Fist fo Legend is one of the best martial arts films ever made. Jet Li is phenomenal and has great charisma. Fist has a good story and action sequences. The Enforcer was awesome. The bond between Father and son was shown well here with the acting of Jet Li and the boy who played his son. Their is a great scene were Jet Li slides down glass that has water running down it. The boy has some great action sequences, too. Twin Warriors had a great plot. It also featured some of Jet Li's funniest moments...he goes a little crazy. Michelle Yeoh and Jet Li had great chemistry. Defender showed again what and intense and nuanced actor Jet Li is and can be. He is the best martial artist as always. If you liked any of these films you must see Romeo Must Die. Jet Li never had such great chemistry with his leading lady, as he had with Aaliyah. Jet Li is the best and will always be a favorite of mine!"
2,Why do they do this?,"On first impression this appear to be a great collection. It contains 4 classic movies by Jet Li. The picture transfer are good and sometimes above average. However, the original soundtracks are completely removed and changed. It would be nice if they have just voice over the Cantonese to English but retained the great and wonderful original music and soundtracks. Take Defender. The original movie was released as Bodyguard from Beijing. It stars a talented pop singer in Hong Kong, Christy Chung and she contributed to the soundtracks by recording a few wonderful songs herself that enhanced the story line and provided appropriated musical theme in the background. In this collection all you will hear is dub over American voice actors and some basic `special effects' like guns and things breaking up. The whole production is now very cheesy and cheap. To make matter worse all 4 movies are similarly butchered."
2,ALL DUBBED! aaugh,ALl 4 movies in this set are dubbed in English. I was horribly disappointed. Dont make the same mistake I did. Find the dubbed ones.
1,DUBBED!!!!NO Subtitles,"I will first and foremost explain the frustration of DUBBED movies. The films original format is not on this DVD. It takes away from the movie & actors. It should have been left in it's original sound format. Any real movie enthusiast frowns upon DUBBED. The dubbed voices are horrible, and it takes from the Kung-fu, and the plotline."
5,Possibly the best album you've never heard.,"This is possibly the best album you've never heard. I know, I know, many people say this about many, many musical offerings but for me at least, this is completely true. I only became aware of Bob Carpenter in 2011 through Midlake's excellent selection on Late Night Tales and the powerful opener 'Silent Passage' blew me away with its strong voice, harmonic acoustic guitars and semi-mystical writing. After six months of trying I finally got hold of a copy of the album on import and it was worth every moment of waiting. I cannot believe that this material never saw the light of day in its own time, so mesmerising are the songs and the delivery of them. Songs like The Gypsy Boy, Down Along The Border and First Light transport me to a special place and I promise, will you too. If you only buy one album this year, make it this one."
3,This book is hardly Charismatic!,"Baxter's argument basically hinges on his interpretation of 1 Corinthians 13:9&10.He argues that the ""perfect"" in verse 10 is in fact the closing of Scripture and that the gifts no longer apply! I wonder if ""knowledge"" has also stopped?He would do well to read Arnold Bittlinger's little book ""Gifts and Graces"", where he says this "" L.Christenson says this--in 1Cor.12:28, GOD has appointed various kinds of tongues. Even if this were the only passage that mentions speaking in tongues, we would have to conclude that this is of abiding value, because GOD has ordained it so"". That statement applies to all of the Gifts mentioned in the New Testament! NOTHING has been revoked or withdrawn in Scripture!I cannot understand how a man of Baxter's integrity and scholarship can overlook verses of Scripture such as 1Cor.12:28 and come to his conclusions!When an author starts using quotes from anti Charismatic Pastor John MacAthur, we should begin to realize his stance!"
4,Typical great quality Bestop product,"I recently installed this rollbar cover on my wife's '81 CJ5. As I've found with all Bestop products, the quality is fantastic. The only reason I don't rate it 5 stars is the foam is a lower quality density as compared to factory. Additionally, the product does not come ""ready to install"". You need to lay out the cover on a clean surface and apply the foam in their appropriate sections. Doesn't sound like a big deal but the foam pieces seemed way too large and overlapped the adjoining pieces by a large margin, and were extremely difficult to zip up when installing on the roll bar. I ended up cutting the pieces down, and it went together fine. The instructions need to be revised so that the installer isn't left guessing. Overall it's still a great product and I would recommend it to anyone wishing to restore or add rollbar padding to their Jeep."
5,Silent Snow by Marla Cone,This is a very well written and well researched book regarding the effects of chemicals on all aspects of the arctic. Ms. Cone addresses the impact that chemicals are having on the human and animal health and the environment. She also discusses the life style and heritage of the inhabitants. It is hard to explain a substance lifestyle to someone who has only gotten their food from a super market. Ms. Cone's description is the best I have read.
5,Pure Genius!,"Back in 1991. A game called Sonic the Hedgehog was made...and it's greatness! Ever since I first played this game I still play it all of the time! The gameplay is amazing! It started a whole series that is still popular today! The graphics are stunning for its time,and I still enjoy them! Certaintly the best game on the Genesis(only serpassed by its sequels.) Buy this game! You won't regret it."
4,not for resale right on the front of the game,"It is the first so no tales or knuckles in this version,plus no charging ur roll and the one i received said mot for resale right on the front but did come in origonal box and almost mint in takes the collector value away:("
4,classic sonic games are pretty fun,Classic sonic games are fun at first. But do not get me wrong they are preety good games! I am still playing it even now! this game is pretty fun! I think it would be the best classic sonic games ever!!! I mean now it is like the oppisite of the beginning. It is fun at the end now. so I would get this game!!! it is very GOOD!!!
2,This game is not a classic.....,"The status of this game is way over blown. I think i got this game maybe 7 years ago at a yard sale for 25 cents. And what a waste is was. I could have got a spent that quarter on a 25 cent burger on Mcdonalds has the 25 cent burger day. But no i bought Sonic the Boring Hedgehog. The levels are dull, The boss's repeat them selfs, Crummy music, And you die alot for no reason........."
1,Outdated badly!,"Horrible 2d crud graphics,Annoying simple gameplay, slow gameplay, boring repetitive bosses, and last but not least annoying tunes that make you want to barf."
4,A Super Game!,"Sonic the Hedgehog is a fast moving game with a super fast character. The game is pretty fun and can get addicting quickly. I liked the way the zones and acts got continually harder. I also thought the music was fitting for each zone. The graphics are great for 1992 Genesis. You speed through loop-de-loops, float over lava, shoot like a pinball and run super fast. There's even a 360-degree rotating maze you go through looking for chaos emeralds. All while dodging the demented scientist Dr. Ivo Robotnik's henchbots!This game (unlike some other Sonic games), is not quite as prone to making you angry when you lose. (A plus) But also keep in mind this was the first Sonic game so if you have played other Sonic games you may find things missing. (One is Super Sonic) But it's still Sonic, so that means it's probably fast paced with lot's of action and a super cool character with lot's of attitude as the star.All in all, I would way this is a pretty fun game."
3,Just Like the Gameboy Advance game,"Sonic is so classic, so I had to get this game when I realized that it wasn't in my Sega collection. The problem with that mentality is that I beat the game on my gameboy advance so it wasn't really exciting for me."
1,Horrible.,"When I bought this game, naturally I was expecting to be able to play the game. FALSE. They sent me a demo game. The game even has ""NOT FOR INDIVIDUAL RESALE"" printed on the front. I can't even play it. I just get to watch it on my console. I would never buy anything else from this person."
3,time to go to sonic speed,this is the best sega game ive played its tough tho it took 7or6 years to make the 2nd level...
4,The mystical core of all the world's great religions,"This is a wonderful book, written by an ordinary man who tells the story of his spiritual journey-from the jungles of Vietnam, to sucess in Hollywood, and finally to a Gnostic Awakening. His great vision and insight is to see that the mystical core of all the world's great religions are pointing to the same Ultimate Reality, which is God, Brahman, Nirvana, or Allah-call it whatever you like.I found this simple, yet profound story to be very inspiring. The Truth is there for all of us to recognize, and the insights Joel gained continue to help me as I walk my own spiritual path."
5,this is great,"These are great books to continue Elsie, even though it's mostly about her children and not her as the main character. The kids and the family are loveable. The plots are also great."
1,There are lots of words I would use to descibe these books..,"and none of them are good! My mother bought me the entire series of about a bazillion books a couple of years ago. Elsie is supposed to be so sweet and good, but she is whiny and snobby in a holier-than-thou way. My criticisms of the writing would be that Elsie is too persecuted, all the characters are sterotypical, two dimensional, and badly developed. It's also very un-engaging. You want to put it down after the first page. My mom was going to make me read the whole series, but after reading the first book she changed her mind- she only read the first chapter and that was enough! She's going to sell the books ..., and I wouldn't be surprised if they went for dirt cheap. They are that bad!"
4,"An acquired taste, perhaps?","I have been a fan of Henry's since ""Plug me into something"" came out. These two albums hit the sweet spot of his career and show some of the singing/songwriting talent that he has. The production by Cashman and West (remember their hit New York City Suite?) is a lot crunchier than you would expect from folk/pop guys.To get the full flavor, you also need to get Henry Gross/Plug me into someting and Love is the stuff (only on LP at his web site). THEN, you really have something.Good guitars, layered harmonies and great production - much better than the single hit would indicate.If you get the best of CD you get a good overall flavor - this album gives you a better taste."
4,A refreshing read,"I deeply enjoyed reading this book. I scrolled reviews from other readers and I noticed that some of them didn't like the book because they find it too slow: that's exactly the quality I liked more.You won't find here a thriller like Patricia Cornwell (which I like as well), hard and full of twists, blood and psichopats, but more an Alexander McQueen one, written with kindness, sensibility and good sense; depicting characters very human, with all their faults and qualities. People easy to find among your friends, maybe sometimes in your mirror; closer at home, less dazzling, but at the end of the book I found myself sorry to leave them, as I would be sorry to leave a friend. I hope to be able to buy the first one on kindle, soon."
3,Couldn't keep Interested,"Jaffarian is an excellent writer. I enjoyed her style but I just couldn't keep interested in this book for some reason. Perhaps it started out so slowly. I put it down halfway through. I'm still willing to read other books by Sue Ann, however, She has a wonderful sense of humor."
5,So funny,"I love this series and might actually have to pay for more of the books to get them on my kindle. This was a good book, Odelia is a well written character with an over powering sense of humor. When you read one of this series you will most definitely want to read the rest of them."
5,Loved this book,"I got this book for free but I am going to pay for the other ones in this series because it was so good. It had loveable characters, fast moving, well written and kept me in suspense until the end. Don't miss this book! If you love the Stephanie Plum series, you will love this one too!"
3,Raney Has Grown as an Author Since This Early Novel,"It is no secret that I am a huge fan of Deborah Raney. Her style of writing is just so easy to read, and the stories she tells have a way of stirring up all your emotions, especially if she's writing a tearjerker.Kindred Bond is one of Deborah's first novels, and I can definitely tell that she has grown as a writer since this book. Not to say that this was a bad story....just that she has greatly improved since writing it. The book is geared more as a romance, and that part of the story is done very well--almost too well as I wanted to throw the book up against the wall a couple of times. :o)There were a few spots that the story seemed to drag, but overall, I'd say it was a good book. If you're new to Deb's books, I would recommend starting with Beneath a Southern Sky or her Clayburn series first to get a better appreciation of her style.3 1/2 stars"
4,Typing Made Easy: Includes Computer Usage,"This booklet has six easy lessons in which you learn the alphabet, symbols, numbers, how to type letters, how to center words and type columns of words or numbers. The two sections on computer use were invaluable. Computer keyboard function keys are identified with their use explained. This includes exercises on how to use the side computer numeric keypad. These exercises can also be used on common calculators. Great for someone who would like to pick up their imputing (word or number) speed."
3,"A real snoozer, not for bedside reading.",A competent but DRY text. I've had a better read with other manuals
5,excellent down comforter,"This is an excellent comforter and arrived on time. Though it had a slight odor when opened, the smell was gone in a day or two. I had been looking for a comforter for several weeks on line and narrowed it down to this one and another. I am please that this turned out to be better than I hoped, for the price. IT is VERY warm and well made. I have it inside a duvet cover and the warmth is incredible. Much warmer than the $250.00 comforter I replaced it with. I will save the other for the summer months. I haven't seen any ""feather"" in the air either-AWSOME!"
2,This case stinks!,"This case stinks, literally. It has smelled toxic from the first time I opened it, and three months later it still smells!"
3,Quick Trip to the 18th Century,"I read this book in a single day. It was a fast-moving, easy to read journey alongside an ordinary 18th century New England couple. While not in great depth, it does touch on the routines, joys, and challenges faced by ordinary people in that time period--whether a slave or a Colonial couple just starting out together. The well-researched backdrop gives a reasonably good sense of what life was like in that time and place, and draws the reader in with the book's fundamental assumption that these are people not unlike you and I in many ways. Definitely worth reading!"
4,Journey to Common Ground by Frederick Fenn,"Really enjoyed this historical fiction novel. Moving characters that pull you right in to the historically correct story line.I had a special Saturday curled up by the fireplace and enjoyed this ""journey"" from beginning to end. I am anxiously awaiting the next book in this trilogy by this wonderful new author. I reccommend this book highly for your reading pleasure!"
1,Entirely Unhelpful,"This DVD is a poor instructional aide. Several steps are demonstrated, but the demonstrations are uniformly too fast for even the most enthusiastic novice to follow. The sequences are long and complicated, but the demonstrations contain no instructional commentary of any kind.For some reason, the DVD also includes some pleasant, seemingly arbitrary footage from old movies. It's good for a chuckle, but its educational value (with regard to the act of dancing) is nil.If you'd like to learn how to dance, this particular DVD will almost certainly not help you very much. In a word, it is disappointing."
3,how to dance tango; como bailar tango,The video helped me and my dance partner in learning the Argentine Tango dance. The tutorial video lessons are easy to follow and our constant practice made us better dance partners. Thank you.
5,What a Classic!,"This is such a classic! im sure if your reading this review, you've seen this movie! I just think the cast is stellar, and to see all that big hair!! Dolly looks the about the same now as she did then, well except her face is a little more pulled back, and she's a bit more ""enhanced"" up top. Enjoy this great performance by some of Americas finest actresses"
2,Fountian And Tumb,"I thought that this book was a realy slow pase. I liked how they tied the beginning to the end and how everyone thought he was crazy. It is sad about the death that goes on durring the storie. The one thing that bugged me about this book was that you never finf out the boys name who is the one telling about the book. It is hard to write about someone when you don't know his name. oh well, it was an ok book, my class thought that it was slow too."
3,Read the fine Print,"There is a mic controller that is required for this product. It allows you to connect a mic to your DVD player. This information was not provided ANYWAY during the ordering process! The only mention of this controller, including the URL and phone number for order (no price indicated) was on the insert INSIDE the DVD case!"
1,Useless,"This is only a book of excel spreadsheet like forms - all empty. There is not one that suggests what you should do. Even the page titled ""checklist"" is blank for you to fill out. I was looking for a guide gently nudging me along the process. A tablet, ruler and a pen or five minutes on excel can give you more organization than this book. Don't waste your money!"
2,Poor Construction,"This is one of the worst constructed cat trees I've ever seen!! The instructions were no help. It is very flimsy. There is nothing to support the poles. The bottom tunnel thing doesn't even have a way it can be attached to the base. Our cats like it and play on it, but I know it won't last long. The screws will be pulling out of the legs in no time; there's nothing to anchor the screws. The partially covered bed will not be staying up much longer, and that is the only thing that holds the legs together. We do not recommend this item. Don't waste your money!"
1,Poor Quality - DO NOT BUY,"First off, this item came with a very poor set of assembly instructions and from there, it all went down hill. When I was almost done building it I realized that two of the posts had broken due to poor quality. The two perches have never been used by my cat because they are so unsturdy so I removed them to give my cat more space to lay around. My cat is actually always laying on top of the third floor ""condo"" and he seems to love it up there which is the only reason I even give it one star. He's never touched the hamock and the sisal posts are already starting to unravel after two weeks worth of scratching.The worst cat tree I've ever seen. The design is fantastic and my cat would be obsessed with the hanging mice and perches if he weren't afraid they'd fall on him. Will never buy from this company again."
5,Love it,"everything about it is great. easy to put together, nice materials, looks good with home decor, price was great compared to pet supply stores. Our cat loves it"
5,my kitten loves it!!,"very easy to assemble! product very durable! my 5 month old kitten, who is huge, loves it!"
3,"Blood, Sweat and Tears have been shed today.","I was really excited about purchasing this item for my cats, honestly I'm sick of being their climbing tree. I got the product about three days after I ordered it, I actually just got notification that it was shipped today but UPS sent me a notice (from their own website) that I was receiving the product today. When I got the box it was in perfect condition, opened it, felt the carpet and was so excited by the quality of the cat tree. Then I pulled out the directions, well that is when all hell broke loose. First I was missing a part of the stairs, the directions are pointless I tried to follow them but after step two I was over them. So there are a few things not put together, I am missing one of the rings below a perch but it's up and my cats love it, so I guess it was worth it but seriously hire someone to put this together or have a cat tree raising party or something."
3,Kitty playground,"The 62"" kitty bungalow was delivered timely and very easy to put together. However, the bungalow doesn't allow much room for climbing up to the various levels. As such, our 7 month old kitten only uses the 2 larger levels and never the top, because he can't get up there. I had to remove the lower ""sling seat"" because it was in the way for climbing up the middle of the bungalow. Overall, it's OK and was worth the money."
4,Information Overload,This book delivers exactly what the subtitle promises - unfortunately. It is the result of a great deal of time and effort from a competent writer. It provides insights into the staffing and operation of a racing team that I haven't found anywhere else but keeping a reader's interest through a 17 race season is a difficult assignment.Dedicated fans may love it but it was too much detail for a casual fan like me.
5,Inside Racing,"I ordered this book to educate myself in a sport that I recently found exciting. It was the perfect fit! It was a diary of a complete season with Pacwest Racing Team; from the development of the team, search for sponsors, the day by day regime thru to winning. I knew I loved to watch Indy / Open Wheel racing, but really wanted a source to educate myself on the specifics of the team members and everyones roles, to car specifics and terms, and what it is all about to race in this sport. I found it to be quite informative, a little tedious at times due to the detail, but extremely helpful. I even re-read and used the book as a dictionary of Indy Racing terms, due to my growing knowledge as the book progressed.I would recommend this book to anyone who wants an indepth /behind the scenes feel for what Indy Racing is about!"
3,"Magical fantasy, some borrowed bits","A peculiar book, borrowing quaint Etruscan traditions to make an interesting entertainment. Typical of this is the way Horatrim is recommended into Roman society by his interesting ideas on drainage and building - a dramatisation of Roman culture borrowing from Etruscan. But it is a magical fantasy. And I don't see that it has any connection with Livy's legend about the Brothers Horatii other than the family name."
2,too many dull stories,"some of the stories were good enough in this collection, but most were too boring too catch your attention (too obvious, boring descriptions, weak plot etc.). i guess you have to be into the old charm of the english ghost story to really appreciate this. i guess i am too modern to be scared by a guy who talks to a guy who turns out to be a ghost, and that's it."
3,Kind of small...,"I got this for my almost 2 1/2 year old grandson. He LOVES trains. He loves it, but I thought it was smaller than I anticipated. It is hard to couple the cars."
4,David Mack ST books are a must read.,"This book is terrific, and somewhat unlike most ST books. I think David Mack really does justice to the Star Trek thought process, and he spins another great tale here.If you haven't read the entire series in 2007, I would suggest ordering the entire series, or at least the next three books at a time if you like this series. It seems the books are getting somewhat rare, and it takes a month to get the middle of this series. If you want to read one after the other, I would suggest biting the bullet here and ordering at least the first seven (Be Born, Die, Sew, Harvest, Love, Hate, Kill)books so that you can read right into this one. I had to wait for the middle books, that I could only find on Amazon, for about a month, and I was really watching my mailbox after reading the first three. Great series of books for the ST TNG fan."
1,star trek-gate,"Ive read a lot of the star trek books and have enjoyed the seriesvery much.i did not enjoy this book at all.it was everything i could do to get through it.it just drudged along.im not even sure if im even going to read the last book in the series.i know the series used storylines dealing with current events a lot,but i thought this was a bit much.when the series or even books did it,for the most part,it was entertaining.this wasnt at all.star trek was never in my opinion political.i enjoyed the first 6 books in this series.i wouldnt recommend this one to anyone."
2,clueless,"Same old dragged out story. A group of actors and others are gathered together in an old mansion in a storm no less. The conversation is stilted and we could care less about any of these people. Feels like the game of clue. I got 3/4 thru this and pitched it. Donald Westlake is an amazing writer, uh, except for here."
4,Awesome,"Wonderful example of 70's Glam Rock, although there are a handful of songs I would have left out, and some big hits of the time were left out, but overall a great collection, I highly recommend it.John T.Houston, TX."
4,Best Grill Except For,"This is in fact the BEST Grill, there is no equal! The only exception is the bottom vents on my unit (3 years old) fell off the first year I had the unit? If you want to replace them they are not cheap around $[...]. Customer service well forget it as there is none... All the written words sound great on their website but, there is no action to be found... One would think they would have sent the vents at no charge right away but, instead they just failed to respond and when they finally did, it was to tell me it would cost money for me to fix the vents."
4,Portable Kitchen Cast Aluminum grill and smoker,"Very simple assembly, I am still learning to use all the vents to utilize the grill's proficiency. A snap to clean and load with charcoal/wood chips! I recommend this grill to anyone who appreciated quality."
5,A Replacement after decades of service,"My dad had one of these for as long as I can remember. I inherited it upon his passing, and it finally burned through on the bottom, after a decade of use in my family. I was heartbroken. I looked for a replacement for years, and have had to settle for the extremely thin junk that was on the market. Imagine my pleasure and surprise when I found this exact replacement. It did not take long for me to decide that this kitchen belonged at my house.From the durability of the origional unit, and the quality of the food it prepares, I am sure that this will be the last cooker I will ever need to buy."
5,Portable Kitchen,"Used the original whigh I bought new about 1958 until the grate burned out and I found the manufacturer was no longer going. Delighted to fine it is again being manufactured - have used in the interval several different grills and have no doubt this is the best, most versatile, over a period of time most economical grill on the market."
5,Grill from the past!,"My Dad had a grill like this that he purchased 25 yrs ago, my brother has it and still grilling on it. my husband wanted one but had no idea about where to find one. We Googled it . We lived in Little Rock, Arkansas about that same time, so I'm sure my Dads came from this same company! My husband was thrilled and has really enjoyed cooking with charcoal instead of gas! Thanks for the good work!!!"
5,un historia hermosa,"este fue el primer libro que lei, y el cual me hizo cuntinuar leyendo los demas, he leido casi todos los libros , y todos ellos tienen un mensaje extrordinario, a mi por lo menos me han hecho rearfirmar mis pensamientos, yo creo que estos libros los lei un momento muy importante de mi vida y sobre todo lleno de tentaciones, miles de preguntas. gracias, Senor, Carlos C. SANCHEZ"
4,Annies favorites,"i LIKE THIS BOOK FOR THE VARITY OF PATTERNS IT HAS. iT ISN'T THE SAME OLD THING OVER AND OVER. THE PATTERNS ARE ALL EASY TO DO AND EACH ONE IS AN INSPIRATION FOR THE NEXT ONE. I CAN'T WAIT TO END ONE AND START ANOTHER. TAKE A LOOK YOURSELF AND SEE THE WIDE RANGE OF ANIMALS AND DOLLS YOU WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE. WHAT A GREAT GIFT FOR YOURSELF SO THAT YOU CAN START ALL YOUR XMAS GIFTS EARLY THIS YEAR. THERE IS SOMETHING FOR ALMOST EVERYONE, GET IT YOU WILL BE GLAD YOU DID..."
1,Equine Arena Handbook,"Interesting facts on soil chemistry, If you are looking for parctical guidelines to designing and building an arena this book is not it."
5,Highly recommended for sincere horse lovers,"The Equine Arena Handbook: Developing A User-Friendly Facility by equestrian expert Robert Malmgren is a no-nonsense, practical guide to building and maintaining proper arena grounds for one's horse to train and exercise. Building an arena is a costly business, and avoiding anything that could risk injury to a horse is even more important, so that anyone contemplating such an undertaking must read the practical guide first. The Equine Arena Handbook is also highly recommended for sincere horse lovers and horse fanciers everywhere, whether they own one of their own or not."
3,Lacking practical information,"In common with some other reviewers, I was disappointed by the lack of specific practical information in this book - drainage designs, depths of base & footing for specific disciplines, fencing, arena size by discpline, crowning & slope - to mention but a few. The focus of this book is soils and it useful as far as it goes. By the time you buy and read this book, however, you have probably moved byond it just by having researched on the internet. For the more practical information, I recommend ""Under Foot"", an inexpensive small volume published by the USDF, which I found very useful, together with advice on arenas provided by Cherry Hill on the internet."
5,Thanks from a Non Rider,"Not being a rider myself, I was totally confused with the need for a sub-base and how the unique impact of a horses hoof can cause failure to the surface.Now that Robert Malmgren has explained the soil mechanics involved in horse hoof impacts, I can now utilize local sub base, base and surface materials better.And now tractor drawn grooming can be done better as I now understand that the B and C horizons need to be addressed as well as the obvious A.Thank you for saving me countless yards of material and wasted time. Dan Lauzon, Rockport MA"
3,Extremely technical,I purchased this book because it had rave reviews. I immediately read the book when it arrived and was a bit disappointed because it has so much scientific jargon it was hard to follow at times. I couldn't help but notice that the author has patents on rubber footing products which he advertises throughout his book.
1,worthless,"I purchased the book hoping to get detailed information regarding the composition of material and drainage requirements for our new indoor arena. This book is completely void of useful information. It discusses soils and the importance of reducing dust, but does not provide recommendations; e.g. depth of base along with depth of sand and mixture ratios of crumbled rubber.Do not buy this book if you are building an arena and need to give your excavator specific directions."
5,What a charger!!!,I bought this for an extra wall unit. It works great. I would buy another if I needed it.
4,Great Chopper,"The Pampered Chef is one of my favorite kitchen tools. It stays sharp and can chop most anything effortlessly. The best part about using this chopper is that cleanup is a snap.(The reviewer was compensated for posting this review. However, the opinion stated in the review is that of the reviewer and the reviewer alone. Further, the reviewer independently selected this product to review and has no affiliation with the product maker/distributor, Amazon or the review requester.)"
3,it works... sortof..,"I was unimpressed, the blades aren't super sharp, so it's mostly good for mashing things into kindof a grated-cheese style pile... but i could just use a cheese-grater for that... it's super easy to use and easy to clean and somewhat fun as a novelty, but i've had it for 3 years and i only used it like 10 times, and each of those times, it didn't really save me any time over just using a knife."
2,Returned It,"I had used my mother-in-law's Pampered Chef chopper and really liked it. But when we got ours, it didn't really work. It was too small for us to put onions under the chopper without doing a lot of chopping first. And it didn't cut through colored peppers well at all - it kind of perforated the vegetables rather than cutting through them cleanly. We ended up returning it because it just didn't meet our needs. Pampered Chef was very cooperative and returned us our money."
3,Hasn't lived up to the hype,"I purchased this last winter after hearing pepole talk about how wonderful it is, how you can chop up anything short of ice with it, etc. Sure it does chop, but you can't chop much at once (not good if trying to chop items for pizza toppings), the items being chopped dont chop evenly (i often end up w/ half the olives desintegrated and the other half still nearly whole), and its not the easiest thing to clean, and nearly impossible to get really clean if you have to wash it by hand. I suppose is your an advanced cook who often chops small herbs for your recipes, or likes to crush up stuff for fancy toppings on ice cream it might be okay, but over all I haven't found a decent use for it."
1,Overpriced...,"My sister-in-law has this product and I thought it would be good to get one myself. This is for sale from the parent company, Pampered Chef itself, for $32!I like to shop Amazon when I can, but not when the price is blatantly inflated...."
5,LOVE my food chopper!,I love this food chopper. It's so easy to use...only a couple pounds and everything is chopped up very nicely. It is very easy to take apart and put back together for a thorough washing. I would recommend it to anyone!
3,OK Chopper,"I bought this chopper because everyone told me how wonderful it was. The chopper does do the job, however, the banging noise is loud enough to raise the dead. Also your hand really takes a pounding using this chopper, and if you have arthritis or carpul tunnel syndrome, you want to steer clear of this item. The pounding becomes quite painful if you have multiple items to chop. It cleaned up just like they said. This is a good chopper, but given all the newer small electric choppers out there, I would go for that instead. I was disappointed and gave mine away."
1,not recommended,"I bought this chopper and was very disappointed. It simply does not work as advertised.Unfortunately, Pampered Chef refuses to accept a return. My advice --- DO NOT BUY THISPRODUCT!!"
3,Chop Chop,"I've owned a lot of slap choppers in my time and all were really junk, most costed around tweny dollars. This is the best chopper I've owned. However I think it's over priced after all you still have to slap it to get it to work"
