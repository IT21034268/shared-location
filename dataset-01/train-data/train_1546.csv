5,The magic of Stardust,"I must admit, I was apprehensive about this movie. I absolutely ADORE Neil Gaiman's books, from 'Neverwhere' to his 'Sandman' series and including the hilarious 'Good Omens'. I could go on and on! But cast and crew came thru on this one, capturing the sweetness and fantasy of Gaiman's fairy tale. Robert DeNiro and Michelle Pfeiffer in particular seemed to have a terrific time with their characters. Thoroughly enjoyed it!"
4,More original than most of the Summer Films of 2007,Stardust is a strange but magical and fun fairystale adventure. It's about a young man who finds a falling star that he promised to a spoiled girl for her hand in marriage. He is surprised that the star is the beautiful Claire Danes (Terminator 3) and it isn't long before he has to protect her.An evil witch wants the star so she can eat her heart and be young forever. She's played by Michelle Pfeiffer who's in good evil form. A group of princes are competing to find her as well because whoever finds her will be the next King.Robert DeNiro plays a gay pirate captain they befriend. He makes believe he's ruthless so his men respect him. DeNiro steals the show as him provides some good laughs. It's his funnest performance in awhile.Stardust failed to gain big audiences in theaters and that's a shame. It was probably the most original movie to come out all summer. I strongly recommend that you to seak it out when it hits dvd.
3,"Pretty good, but not great.","The overall story was pretty good, but it was unnecessarily violent. This is not a kids' movie. I could have done without Robert De Niro prancing around in womens' underwear as well. I enjoyed it - the ghosts were funny - but it could have been a lot better."
4,Stardust,I love this movie. It is really great. Watch it now. Will take you on an adventure. Great for everyone to watch.
5,An Adult Fairytale ...,"Truly just a fun, entertaining movie ... Terrific cast, story and musical score. The movie hums along at a fun pace. Worth checking out!Gaiman + Vaughn = WINNING"
3,BluRay picture quality is so so,The Story itself is excellent. BUT the picture quality of this bluray disk is at best as good as DVD.
3,Stardust movie,"I thought I was buying the DVD. My error. So I can only watch the movie on the computer and I can't turn on the CC. Again, I guess it was a learning experience. I won't do it again."
5,Charming Fantasy,"I'm not much for fantasy, but this film captured my heart. Claire Danes is a true star in this film which is all about finding true love. There is a lot of death in the movie, but much of the gruesomeness is left up to your own mind to define. I wouldn't recommend it for younger children, but it's a great movie for not-too-sensitive tweens and above."
1,SHipping Ripoff,When I check the shipping charges and find out it is $6.99 to ship vacuum cleaner bags that is what I expect to pay. I was shocked to see that it changed to $13.87!!!!!!!!!! when I received verification of my order.This should certainly be illegal and I will never order from this site again.
1,Why can't there be zero stars?,"Sorry~this did not meet my expectations at all. I bought this CD to set the mood and get us in the mood after a long work week. Lit the candles and dimmed the lights. This music was not what I was expecting and we ended up talking about how terrible each song was. Perhaps it is good music, but did not have the intended effect nor was it what I expected. Unless you are familiar with this type of music, don't buy it..."
1,so good! ([...]),"This album was mostly made in the ""Quantiverse Studios"" of Pitsburg. A little known fact is that the 19th track was originally supposed to be Michaelmatician's ""Quivering Relics"". Ultimately this track as well as others were left off and instead intended for the 2nd Volume. The 2nd volume hasn't occurred yet.However, the Music of Michaelmatician can be heard.2.342"
1,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed with this music. I don't know if you can return a CD but I should have tried. I love Amazon but this product was over-rated and based on the other reviews I thought it would be great. I love ""Rendezvous Lounge"" and I thought this would be even greater than that but it wasn't. Music was flat and not enticing at all."
3,"What's ""Love"" got to do with it?","Very pleasant background music but not especially creative or groundbreaking. Of course, that's not what background music is all about.While I'm sensitive to music influencing my mood and emotional state, I can't say that this album (CD) had any special effect on my libido nor should it be considered aural aphrodisiac. Your results and affects may differ of course.If I want I want to be sexually stimulated, I listen to Norah Jones or even Johnny Cash (""Tennessee Stud"" is awesome!) or even a Borodin string quartet.Maybe I'm not the right audience for this type music. I don't regret the purchase but I'm not likely to buy similar products."
5,Relax and chill,"I have several CD's from the Intentcity label. I love them all. They are relaxing, sexy, but not sleepy. Good mixes from different artists. If you like the Buddha Lounge series or Cafe de Luna CD's, you'll like this one and Intentcity's other stuff too."
5,"Wow!!!!! Hot, Hot, Hot... But Very Good Stuff.","This stuff has a bite to it, so start with a little and adjust from there.We made the mistake of smothering our ribs with it, and WOW!!!!! burn your lips off hot..We have since learned to cut the rub with a bit of brown sugar and comes out perfect.."
3,English Composition and Grammar,The book came from Good Will and I discovered that one of the two sections I had bought it for had 12 pages cut out. I do copy editing for several non-profit newsletters and I wanted a reference for iffy decisions on punctuation. So far I have not found the book of much help on that score -- no better than Webster's dictionary or the Associated Press Stylebook. It would be useful for someone who doesn't know their grammar.
2,Fair book. Somewhat antiquated.,"I purchased this book to add to my library after reading several reviews on Amazon. The book has some valuable information, but you can obtain most of the same information from Strunk & White's ""The Elements of Style."""
1,No Answer key?,"Warriner's text book is virtually useless without the corresponding answer key. The author supplies ridiculously simplistic examples along with their respective answers and then offers ridiculously complex sentences as exercises to test what one has just ""learned."" Don't even think about using this book to learn grammar unless you can somehow find the answer key. Good luck."
1,Confused,"OK, now I am confused. There have been both pro and cons for this product and completely opposite. I love the price but if the negatives are so intence, then may be I should wait. Dan, I'm with you, I would someone that has troubles with this product to email me and explain their discontent.sequoia5@msn.com"
2,"Good for other dogs, not so good for yours.","The author presents some interesting theories as to what makes a dog bite, but offers few solutions other than calling her in to fix things. For North American readers, this presents a problem as her Bark Busters business is in Australia. She also has many touching stories, but that's not why I bought the book.I had hoped that this book would offer me tips on how to retrain my dog's aggressive behavior, but the tips given focus mainly on keeping a dog from biting you and not on how to stop bad behavior.If you are interested in a new approach to canine aggression psychology, you might be interested in this book. If you are interested in dog training, I recommend trying a different book instead."
4,ALMOST PERFECT,"If the FISH BAND, would have just left off the weird sounding song ""USE ME"", in place for there fan favorite...""TOOTIE"",.......We would have a perfect album. Really,seriously.....the song ""USE ME"", just doesn't fit right with all the rest.If they ever come out with a new hits cd , this is all they need to do.........for this album contains everything good ( ANY LEFT OFF SONGS FOR THE NEXT HITS ALBUM, WOULD BE DISSAPOINTING ). This album, is arranged ( SONG ORDER ), very well. JUST DROP THE SONG ""USE ME""......to funky, for this bands own style."
4,The recipient said it's awesome!,"I personally cannot review this cd because I bought it as a gift for someone, but that someone said it is an AWESOME cd! So, if you are a Hootie fan, and the recipent most definitely was, I would not hesitate to recommend this cd. Besides, it has like every hit song they did, how can you go wrong??? I'm glad to see that Hootie is still around. Makes me feel not so old!!!! Enjoy it! Oh, and I AM going to get this for myself too!!!"
1,Please...,"You people are so deprived of GOOD music...This has ALWAYS BEEN BORING crap...and ALWAYS will be. Go to any church band and they sound the same...not terribly difficult or thought provokning for that matter...it just annoys you and makes you really pity the people who live the ""Cookie-Cutter"" life...so sad..."
5,Eureka! an edit-free Greatest Hits!,"None of the hits have been edited from their full length album versions on this compilation, and all the top 40 hits from their two big albums are accounted for. The only song that is not the same length as on the original CD is ""Tucker's Town."" On the album version, after the song ends, there is a pause of silence, and then this 30 second accapella part comes on. It's not particularly of any use to make the song better, and it's omitted on this disc."
4,"2 good songs missing, some duds here","Where is Hannah Jane and Drowning? Some of the later stuff pales in comparison to the quality of songs on their first two albums. Buy Cracked Rear View and Fairweather Johnson and you will have ALL of their good stuff! Hey, if 1996 ever rolls around again, these guys may become cool again."
5,Great Edition to the Hootie Line-Up,"This is an excellent release from Darius and the guys. The Blowfish do a good job at including their best songs to construct an incredible compilation. While these may be their greatest hits, that doesn't mean these songs are their only good ones. Check out Cracked Rear View, Fairweather Johnson, Musical Chairs, etc. for other Hootie gems, especially the two closing tracks off Cracked Rear View, ""Tootie"" off Fairweather, and ""Home Again"" off Chairs. For the casual Hootie listener, though, this collection of material is essential. Keep up the good work, guys! Can't wait for the next album!"
2,Once Again Hit By The Manufacturer....,"These use to be my favorite gloves because they were more hearty. Now they have made them thinner and I do not like as much. Easier to breach. This manufacturer stuff is getting ridiculous. Less for the same or price increase. Very tedious, not cool!Update 11-24-11Several have come out of the box ripped. Several have ripped for no apparent reason. I have some large of the old ""good"" quality and compared to these newer mediums and the differece is significant, for latex anyway. If you don't need them to stand up to much movement, then I suppose they are ok. Double boo to the manufacturer.Update 4-13-12These gloves have been a total waste for me. I ended up buying the 6.3 mil and those are more the thickness these USE to have. Same crap, different day as far as manufacturers goes. Can you tell yet that manufacturers frustrate me to no end?"
4,Diamond Grip Gloves Medium Size 100 box,"Application used for: Automotive workI bought two boxes of the medium size Diamond Grip Gloves. Received fairly quickly and used them the next day. The only reason i gave 4 out of 5 stars was due to the fact that these seemed to rip more easily than when i buy them from the store. It could be a bad or old batch and i have only been using one of the boxes so far. That said, they are still better and longer lasting than any other latex glove i have used."
5,Diamond grip gloves,Been using these for many years in the lab and out of the lab.Fits comfortably and does the job. I would recommend these for any light duty requiring latex gloves. I use them when I work on my vehicles.
3,Au gratin dish,"The dishes are basically nice, but the labels on the products were terrible to get off and, in one of the dishes, left a faint print of the words that were on the label. It is fading in time, but it was a problem that was not easily solvable. I used ""professional"" removers and they had no effect on the label--what ended up working was sink cleaner and elbow grease. I like the dishes and use them at least once a week--perfect for very small portions and handy if there are only two people in the home."
2,no point in Nicole,"""Nicole"" was a disappointment. The movie made little to no sense. If you're looking for a story line, forget it. I got the movie merely because Catherine Bach is in it, but she does not have the leading role, and does not appear in the film enough to please me. She's probably not in it enough to please anyone. Even just as far as a movie goes, it'll leave a bad taste in your mouth. Don't waste your money, or time on it."
2,bobbaloo,"Check out TROMA. They redid this movie and named it CRAZED. Its on DVD and at a fair price. Its the same stars, the same movie. They only renamed it. Its got Catherine Bach who looks great but, the movie wasn't all that great. I thought it was rather dull. The video quality wasn't very good either. See the discription of this movie above and you will see that the discription of this movie says the same thing."
4,Value for money,"I was looking for something a little out of the ordinary that wasn't going to cost more that i had to put in it...this looked a different and (to put it simply) is.I've had it a while now and have been using it daily. It's fairly stacked with plastic (loyalty cards rather than the useful kind) plus the usual bundles of receipts etc. So far it's held up well. If anything it's looking better with use, with-out looking as thought it is wearing out.I'd recommend it to any of my friends or family.Only reason for 4 and not 5 stars is i just can't get that excited about a wallet!"
1,eel skin wallet,"I was very disapointed with this wallett. All the slots to put credit cards, drivers license in were too small. Nothing fit. I would not purchase this again. I did not send it back because it would have cost more money."
5,Best wallet I ever had,Durable I think it will last foreverBeautiful and original materialIt has all the compartments anyone could possibly needGreat rich color
5,Magnificence from Sokurov....,"This is a very unique experience. It is, in many ways, a miniseries. Sokurov filmed actual footage of Russian sailors patrolling the Arctic circle, and the landscape is bleak and terrifying. It's hard to believe anyone could exist there, yet the Russian navy has bases there. This is not a documentary, however. While there is actual footage of sailors, it is interspersed with the story of a captain disillusioned with Navy life, and life in general. This film/miniseries is the polar opposite of what you would see on American TV. It is very languourous, quiet, haunting, profound, and meditative (like much of Sokurov's work). Sokurov's narration (he does the voice over himself) is equally profound, and adds greatly to the narrative. It is reminiscent of great Russian artists, like Tarkovsky and Dostoyevsky."
4,JWIN JD-VD745 Portable DVD Player,"The Good:I have owned this item for more than a year and it still works great, it has great audio & Video, you can change the audio and subtitles with one push of a button like a regular DVD player, play CD-R's with MP3's, Pictures, VCD and burned DVD's, you can also use it on the road as a normal TV set changing the outputs to inputs with a button letting you play video games on it or to view a camcoder's image. You can also rotate the screen to view it upside down for those who want to attach it to the roof of a vehicle, and it also has two headphone jacks, S-Video, Digital Audio, ect.The Bad:It doesn't come with the car power adaptor, :(Audio & Video cables are short (You will have to have it next to the TV Set for regular use).Only comes with RCA video & Audio cables."
2,JWIN 745 bomb,"I received the JWIN 745 as a Christmas gift. I used it to play three DVDs and liked the screen size and sound. I didn't use it for about 9 months, it being stored in a drawer in the environmentally controlled house undisturbed. I placed a DVD in the player and it spun up until the DVD stopped spinning and the screen said ""stop"". It did not play. I replaced the DVD with two others that played on my other equipment. No luck. I looked up JWIN to see about warranty and haven't had success.I don't plan to purchase any JWIN products in the near future."
4,So funny and so true.,This book exemplifies how gullible the public is and especially the corporate management today.Dilbert would agree with this book.
5,Fantastically useful,"I read Gowa's book for a graduate course, and found it to be immensely helpful for contextualizing international relations debate. She writes in a clear style and her insights are well-articulated. Highly recommended - research is also meticulous and precisely documented."
2,Save your $$$,"This is not like your regular TAE BO dvd's, I did not enjoy it, and didn't feel like I got a nice energetic workout. I should note I did not buy the punching bag, my husband and I just shadow boxed, but I just feel like TAE BO is known for heart pumping cardio, and this should be more like a nap with a few punches."
4,Lovely!,"I absolutely love this CD and needed to share it so I purchased two for friends. The music is so beautifully done! It's lovely music for meditating or journeying to, performing ritual to, or just for relaxing and reflecting. It takes me away to some far-off place, where I can day dream or contemplate, or just do nothing."
5,Another GREAT Regional Lighthouse Book,"First, this book is chocked full of Bruce Roberts' beautiful photographs of the lighthouses in this region. The photographs are nothing less than SPECTACULAR! Combined with the revised and updated information on each makes this regional lighthouse guide a requirement you won't want to be without whether you're visiting the region or a life-long resident. The text contains full, rich descriptions of each lighthouse, too.I have many lighthouse books and all of Bruce Roberts' and Ray Jones' regional guides. I've read them all and used most of them while traveling. I've found them to be first rate, an excellent choice for people who want everything lighthouse between two covers. A joy to look at and informative to read."
5,Used Olympus EC-14 Teleconverter,"I am writing this review for a used EC-14 Teleconverter (TC). I am using the TC with my Olympus 70 - 300mm zoom lens on an Olympus E-30 DSLR camera. Due to the weather, I've had little opportunity to really test the picture quality through the TC. What little I was able to do, it appears the TC is functioning normally.I purchased this lens used from a little camera shop, JEM Photo, (Via Amazon) I believe to be in Wisconsin. Everything about the transaction with JEM/Amazon was perfect. Even the price is the best I have seen anywhere (and believe me, I have checked). Delivery was ahead of schedule and the lens was delivered in the original box with all the original paperwork and warranty. The TC lens appeared to be unmarked and it looks brand new. Thanks JEM and Amazon for the quality lens and the great service.Denny G. (Carlsbad, CA)"
5,Teleconverter,High quality lens extension. Saves space & weight in the camera bag for the few times when an extra-long lens is required.
4,This book is great for anyone who likes vampire stories!,"This book is great for anyone who likes vampire stories! It is also great if you don't like reading the same story the whole time! It has many different authors that have written great stories of vampires that are fat,are in love with a mortal(human), and even vampires that want to have a baby!"
5,Awesome figure,"The figure is everything I expected. Great detail, good colors and the young lady is bomb shell to say the least.The item was well packed and arrived safe and sound."
3,NOT IN THE FIRST LINE,"I DONT THINK I GAINED TOO MUCH FROM GOING OVER THIS BOOK BECAUSE I ALSO DID THE QBANK AND QBOOK WHICH TO MY OPINION ARE BETTER THAN THE BLUEPRINTS.BUT STILL, THE FORMAT OF THE QUESTIONS IS NICE ,AND IF YOU ARE RUNING OUT OF QUESTIONS AND STILL HAVE SOME SPARE TIME,THIS BOOK IS A GOOD OPTION."
5,I love it,"I chose this Snappy Drill Adapter to be able to use my drills on my new Makita Impact driver. I used it a couple of times. It worked great for my project. I can now just buy regular drill bits and use this wonderful adapter. It feels rigid, good steel material.Will recommended."
5,I LOVE this cd,"I purchased this cd because my cousin used to listen to Stan Getz, when I was young! I really didn't appreciatejazz then, but I do now!! This music is so AWESOME, I've never listen to Moonlight in Vermont, so beautifully!!It was DEFINITELY worth what I paid for it/the FIVE stars I'm giving it!!"
3,Not too sure about wireless,"I purchased this product, and just read the previous reviewer's comments about not having to use wires. My electrician had to use wires to run from the mirror (front of vehicle) all the way to the back..so I'm not too sure about the wireless part...maybe he did something wrong? Anyway, two of the sensors were bad, and therefore, the system is not working at its best.I own a SUV and am somewhat very disappointed that I paid quite a lot for something that now cannot work since two of the sensors are bad."
5,Take it easy! This is a good thing,"Elizabeth Smart's return to her family isn't an event that has enormous historic importance (and I have to say I'm usually very resistant to media over-hype), but this story did really get to me. It's not a great book but I'm giving 5 starts because I can much better see where the parents are coming from after reading it and I actually think they've held up pretty well considering everything they've had to face. 2 stars for effort and 3 stars for a touching story. Don't be too cynical."
2,Abduction,"Elizabeth Smart's parent's story told by them, concerning their search for their daughter. This is not Elizabeth Smarts story. If you are researching abduction, this book is probably of only secondary interest."
1,Disapointing,I was disapointed with this book. I feel like it was written too soon and could have been much better if they had waited until after the trial. It has the feel of a church talk given by the parents that has been padded out enough to make a book and rushed into production while public interest was still high. I was abducted when I was younger than Elizabeth and was interested to read about how she found the strength from her faith to make it through such a long ordeal. Unfortunately this book only covers her parents side of the story. Had they waited until after the trial and included more details from Elizabeth's perspective along with the frustrations of her parents trying to work with the officials I think this could have been a very powerful book. As it is now I am not surprised that some readers are very critical and feel that the family presents themselves as a little too perfect and looking to make money from their story.
1,Not Impressed,"I was not impressed...I guess I would have been if I wanted to join the LDS church, but this book lacked detail and seemed to be Ed and Lois' attempt to make money off of thier kidnapped daughter. This book left a bad taste in my mouth."
1,despicable on many levels,"First, and most obviously, this book is the result of parents capitalizing on their daughter's ordeal. Why? Because they're tired of not being in the spotlight anymore? It's hard to raise that many children on an ordinary income? Second, this book only furthers the perception that only cute white girls are abducted. The truth is that many children are abducted everyday, but we never hear about them because they are not the children of perfect, upper-middle class white families. Yes, the kidnapping of Elizabeth Smart was tragic, and must have been a horrifying ordeal for her family. But is this book even remotely an appropriate response to that??!!"
3,Bringing Elizabeth Home,"Bringing Elizabeth Home was a heartwarming story about Elizabeth's tragic journey. I would of preferred it if Elizabeth told the story rather then Elizabeth's parents: Ed and Lois Smart. But I think that there were rumors going around about Elizabeth's story, and they just wanted to tell the world what really happened.They are a really strong family for having to go through Elizabeth's kidnapping. Escpecially her sister (Mary-Katherine) for having to see her sister getting kidnapped, and not being able to do anything to save her sister. I enjoyed reading about the Smart's sad but also happy story."
2,A disappointment,"I found Bringing Elizabeth Home a well-written account of what Ed and Lois Smart went through when Elizabeth was kidnapped. It details their ordeals with the media and law enforcement and their frustration with the political limitations in finding lost children. It also is a continuous witness to their religious beliefs. In these areas the book is informative and may provide needed changes for our society in helping these lost and stolen children and their families. However, the book tells almost nothing of Elizabeth's ordeal, giving no more information than already reported in the media. Understandably the criminal case cannot be compromised but some testimony to what she went through and how she survived would seem to be warranted. It would be like reading the Jessica Lynch story of her captivity in Irag and only hearing about what her family thought and endured here in the states. I found the book a disappointment and still await Elizabeth's story."
1,A Tragedy the Incident & the Book,It was and is a tragedy this young girl was victimized as she was. The sick criminal that did this could never be punished enough to give Elizabeth back her innocence.If the reader is looking to learn all the details and facts about the trials and tribulations of Elizabeth as a hostage they will be disappointed.This book is a story about Christian faith. It should be about a parents failure to teach their children about the brutal realities of life and their naivete towards strangers. Be cautious with who and what parents allow in and around the home of children.
3,"OK, but the TV movie was better","This book was ok.. it's small so not a long read. The details were Ok, mostly the same story we saw on tv. The main reason I disliked it is that it's heavy on Mormon/Church of Latter Day Saints propaganda. Instead of using the Holy Bible for their scripture quotations, they use the Mormon books like the Book of Mormon and Doctrines and Covenants (D&C) Many people who are Christians may not like the Mormon preaching in the book. So why would people accuse Latter-day Saints of not being Christian? Apparently it has little to do with whether or not we believe in Christ and more to do with what we believe about Christ. Do the resarch yourself on the Latter Day Saints beliefs http://www.godandscience.org/cults/#mormonism and then decide if you want to be preached at for 150 pages.The book, is OK.. I would reccommend the unauthorized one calledHELD CAPTIVE-THE KIDNAPPING AND RESCUE OF ELIZABETH SMART."
1,It would be nice...,"Yeah, it would be great if the whole Smart story were as storybook as we were lead to believe. But... there are too many inconsistancies in this story... to many things that leave you scratching your head. We aren't being told the whole story; there has to be much more to it. We aren't niave... tell us the truth."
1,"American insensitivity...anything for a buck, or MILLIONS",can't any of you who buy into this see what it's really about? This is sick...
5,Uplifting!,"No, this book is not a feeding frenzy for those looking for gruesome details of Elizabeth Smart's 9-month ordeal. As her parents point out in this book, it will be her decision whether or not to ever make those private details public. Rather it is just what the title and subtitle of the book imply: her parent's story of the toll the ordeal took on them & their family and how they held everything together through faith and prayer until Elizabeth was brought home. Encouraging scripture and relevant explanations of their LDS faith are interspersed with chronological details of the investigative process. Ed and Lois Smart, I am rejoicing with you in God for this miracle! The importance of family and faith jumps off every page here. Read it and be inspired!"
5,Excellent Flavor!,"I tried this curry paste after I found it recommended in Pressure Perfect by Lorna Sass, a cookbook with recipes for pressure cookers. Well, the first thing that I made with it was curry chicken. It became an instant family favorite. Since then, I have tried it in other dishes and I was never disappointed. The flavor is rich and intense without being overpowering. I have also used it in Hot and we like it too, but it would not be good for people who are not used to heat. I find the paste to be much better than any powders that I have tried and it gives a more authentic flavor."
2,Very Tough to Read,"This is a book that is supposed to be works of surrealist poets, but not all of it is. This is a tough book to read at any level. It makes it ten times worse to read if you really don't like/understand poetry. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone, unless of course that person has a great appreciation for French poetry."
4,Good purchase (missing 1 critical piece),"Definitely needed extra track and this is a great extra track set. However, even though I purchased it in a sealed box it was missing a critical switch track piece. Should have been in there, but was not. The single switch was missing. This drove my son crazy, because he could not complete the track. Never bothered calling, he got over it. This train is very durable and he loves the additional track."
4,an outstanding introduction to rebetika artists,This is an excellent compilation of famous older artists of rembetica. The info pamphlet with the cd is the best I've ever seen. It makes a wonderful introduction to this music style. This recording has led me to get some albums of some of these artists: Dalgas and Papagika in particular.
3,Middle-East Fusion,"""Between Dusk And Dawn"" was originally recorded in 1986, and released in 1987. The style is a blend of middle-east style music with jazz improvisation, which makes for an interesting combination. Rabih Abou-Khalil composed all the pieces on this album, although ""The Thing That Came Out Of The Swamp"" was a joint effort with Michael Armann. ""Nightfall"" and ""Dawn"" are two of my favorite pieces on the album.The musicians bring a wide variety of instruments, which clearly has a large influence on the sound and feel of each track. The musicians are: Rabih Abou-Khalil (oud, flute), Charlie Mariano (soprano and alto saxophones), Glenn Moore (bass), Glen Velez (frame drums, darabukka, percussion, overtone singing), Ramesh Shotham (South Indian percussion), Christian Burchard (marimba), and Michael Armann (piano)."
5,really nice!,"the color is a nice bright pink, so hopefully this is what you want. The mouse is kind of small, which is nice if you have small girl hands. It lights up and is really cute."
3,If this didn't look so cute....,"Five stars for looking cute and drawing comments, but the quality leaves something to be desired. The keyboard actually seems to be good quality for the price, but the mouse is quite frustrating. Frequently, the mouse pointer just ""wanders off"" when the mouse is stationary and occasionally bounces all over the screen when I'm trying to, for example, scroll down a page. Also, after two months of moderate use the pink is rubbing completely off the mouse under my index finger. Draws lots of compliments and I like the keyboard media features but I would not purchase this product again."
5,Bunnies,That's the subject of the 1st email my 5 yr old daughter sent me. The keyboard and mouse were for her new computer and they both work flawlessly.
5,Saitek Keyborad & Mouse Combination,"The pink Saitek Keyboard & Mouse Combination was exactly what my 6 year old granddaughter wanted and it is working great. However, Amazon did not deliver within the two days for which I paid a higher delivery price. It took Amazon five days to deliver. Paying the extra money for a fast delivery was a rip off."
3,"Great performances, poor video quality","I still think that this DVD can find a spot on your shelf. Be warned when the camera takes on a long shot, the video is quite poor. When shooting on stage, the video is not bad. The performances are great."
5,A Thrilling Double Header!!,"This recording of these two masterpieces does justice to their honored place in the operatic Pantheon. Domingo is in marvelous voice and is at the peak of artistic involvement. Troyanos is superb. Her rich, dark mezzo fully encompasses the tragic figure of Santuzza. The one weak point in the Cav is the Alfio. His voice is too top heavy,using force rather than projection to sing this role. He is good but not in the same league with Troyanos and Domingo.The Pag is evenly outstanding. Milnes' portrayal of Tonio is vocally exemplary as is his acting. Domingo continues his excellent singing in this long and vocally taxing twin bill. Stratas brings a fresh, personal interpretation of the unfaithful wife. Levine conducts with a deft and sure hand bringing out the beauty and the vulgarity of human interaction.He brings to life the magic of the musical score in both works.This DVD is worth owning regardless of how many other versions one has."
5,Excellent product,"It is always a pleasure and a priviledge to hear Domingo sing, always... and this particular DVD with two of the most popular and beautiful operas, is a must collection piece. I hope that more of these will be released in the future, La Boheme with DOmingo, for instance, in any of his presentations at the Met Opera House, would be a treat.I am an eternal fan of Domingo, and have a very huge collection of all of his CD's DVD's and anything new that comes out, I buy at once, without a doubt."
1,Caveat Emptor,"This product is represented as a list price of $29.98 but is offered at a low price of $89!! Maybe this is some sort of reverse logic. Secondly, the product is defective -- at least mine was. The picture constantly breaks up into digitized squares, particularl;y when the camera pans. Very amateurish. Makes you wonder about the source of the product.And for those opera buffs who like traditional opera (i.e., a staged production -- not a film) please be aware that these two operas are FILMS. Therefore, they give you no idea how the composers intended for the operas to be presented on stage. I also expected a live performance at La Scala and would have liked to see the orchestra play, as well as audience reaction. It's non-existent because these are films."
2,A no-brainer,"I have often enjoyed David Wiltse's works, but this one is a no-brainer. It just does not work. Appears both he and the publisher of this new paperback rested on his past laurels - with the former whipping out a messy and ill-drawn plot in a weekend and the latter failing to even read it before sending it to the printer."
4,John Becker is one scary agent,"This is the second book I've read of the FBI Agent John Becker series by Wiltse. Becker's a troubled, on-the-edge sort whom the bad guys fear will go nuts and whack them just because he can't help himself. Sort of a disturbing characteristic to find in an FBI agent. Characterizations were excellent from the gangbanger street types to the hitman wannabe to the redhaired blushing female agent with the gun strapped to her thigh. Excellent"
2,WILL THE REAL DAVID WILTSIE PLEASE RETURN!!!!,"I loved allllll of Wiltsie's previous books and I especially enjoyed development of the heroic John Becker...what a guy....but am curious to find out where Wiltsie went and who is using his name on this book??????? Could not believe that it was written by the same guy.....if you reallllllly want some reallllly fine writing...a great ""secret"" author is Robert Walker and his incredible ""Instinct"" series with his amazing Dr. Jessica Coran...this is one writer that Wiltsie could take lessons from....if and when he comes back....I really like John Becker but not having to read this type of predictable, boring tripe such as ""Blown Away""....sorry."
1,Dismal Plot and Characters Make This Wiltse's Nadir,"David Wiltse's A PRAYER FOR THE DEAD and INTO THE FIRE are full-throttle, imaginative, spellbindingly terrifying novels that really get the job done. And John Becker has emerged from them as one of the most interesting series characters in fiction today. Unfortunately, after the remarkably poor BONE DEEP, Wiltse has plummeted even further to banality with BLOWN AWAY, a true stinker of a novel. The villian of the piece, Swan, is a laughable creation, and his association with a repressed homosexual gangster is uninteresting and poorly shaped and detailed. There's no suspense, no plot worth engaging in, and Becker is left with practically nothing to do. The result is a complete disaster from a usual first-rate writer."
2,A Major Disappointment,"After reading all of Wiltse's previous books--each of which I would rate between 8-10--Blown Away is a major disappointment and should be Thrown Away. Unlike the previous Becker books, Wiltse provides has provided little depth to his plot and to his character development. It may be that Wiltse's ""well has run dry"" when it comes to stories featuring John Becker."
2,Where is the groove?,"I am a huge Karl Denson fan and I have been ever since the Freestylin' with DJ Greyboy. All the artists on this album I have purchased or seen live in the past individually. (Ron Levy, Charlie Hunter, MMW etc..) I just saw Karl at Jazzfest ....Karl, where is the funkjazz and groove we all came to love?? This is a disappointing effort in my opinion. There are only 9 songs. I wouldn't waste your time with this one....If you want to continue with the funk and groove I would suggest going to Karl's shows live, buying the Greyboy Allstars CD's, listening to Robert Walter's 20th Congress, or checking out any of these artists individually."
5,Our daughter is in love with this play!,"Our six year old daughter rented this movie and loves it. She has always been fascinated with Cinderella. We are to return the movie today and she is insisting it is hers. Our daughter is autistic and for her to have this much interest in a play amazes me. I catch her singing the songs. Maybe we have an actress to be on our hands? So, for us this is a great movie because it is so well done and it has inspired our daughter."
4,Just a fun bit of fluff,"Don't expect something visually amazing. This is a movie of a stage production. However, that being said, the costumes were cute and the music fun. My nieces and I loved to watch it together and it's not like you have to worry about them throwing out any profanity. It's good times."
2,Characters Need to Be Adults,I've read several books by Thompson and I have to say her books read very juvenile to me and it puts me off. I don't know if it's her characters or their dialogue but every main female character in her books comes across like a girl instead of a woman. The plots always sound good but I just can't get past the immaturity in her novels.
3,Great product...So So Customer Service.,"Product was received in timeframe it was susposed to. Love the tent but it had nothing to stake it down with or to attacth the pole to on the front right corner, which was a loop that was totally different from all the other corners. After e-mailing Coleman's customer service, they finally sent me a piece to put on the odd corner stating that they did not have a replacement tent for me. Nowhere on the site did it say that I was purchasing a second. I felt this is what I got. Actually a third. I felt like I should have been able to return the defective tent to Coleman and they send me a new one that was not defective. I am stuck with the odd cornered one. Otherwise the tent is great."
2,Poor build quality,"Bought the tent to replace a smaller tent from another manufacturer, thought that the Coleman name would mean I would get a quality tent. The tent is roomy and well ventilated, however upon setting it up and attaching the rain fly to the first corner, the elastic cord pulled right out - the loop holding the cord to the rain fly was never sewn completely. Not to worry, I thought I would just use my knife to modify the defective loop by cutting a hole in it - worked - attached the cord.But - upon attaching the SECOND corner - SAME THING, the loop failed. What about the THIRD corner you ask? SAME THING! Ok, Fourth corner was different....The loop had ALREADY FAILED and the cord was already GONE, not even in the bag. I know like about everything, these are sewn in China but somebody should have caught that.If this is indicative of the kind of QC Coleman has established, I would steer clear of the brand all together. Now starts the process of returning / warranty - wheeeee!"
3,It leaks,"This is an older model which the length is 2 feet longer. It rained downpour for a whole day and water sipped in from the horizontal part of the zippers. It also leaks in 1 corner. It is not so bad that I would want to return. A towel tuck in the corner would do but you will have a moisture problem. Ventilation is OK.Most of campers and backpackers say they have to re-seal the tent before use but I don't agree. Does that mean Coleman is selling an incomplete product or a not ready to use. It's like buying a brand new car but you have to do a tune-up before driving it out of the dealer's lot.Other than that, it does what it says to do."
4,fair tent,"Received the tent in about a week. Tent is easy to set up. We put a queen airbed and had enough room to walk around the sides of tent and room for our stuff. Probably good for four people, comfortably. Center height was ample, but the sides of the tent were at an angle, person walking near the sides had to hunch to walk around the sides of the tent(im only 5' 10""). Cold at night, due to the big vents, more of a summer tent. Overall good tent."
4,The first CD that I ever bought,"I bought this CD back during the Christmas of 1985, back before I even had a CD player yet! Excellent sound quality, and it has 11 of the 12 songs from 'Christmas with Conniff', but sadly is missing ""Christmas Bride"". It has many songs from the weaker 1971 album, but does include the excellent ""1st Noel"" song. I suggest buying the 1st two Conniff Christmas LP's instead, which are both 5 stars, each on their own."
5,Great CD,Great CD for the holidays. Very traditional Christmas music!!! Excellent. Many of the traditional Christmas songs you would expect! Highly recommend.
5,"Great Seat Cover, Esp. if Your Seat Looks Like The Picture","This is a really nice seat cover, very soft and pretty. Certainly worth the price, although I kind of wish they came in pairs and at a reduced price for the two. Anyway, it looks just like the picture. Unfortunately for me, my seat has various knobs and handles on the side which interfere with the seat cover fitting snugly, as shown in the picture. Still, if you don't look terribly closely, it's fine."
1,*Sigh*,"I wonder, if a donkey had some writing on it's rear end would it get 3/5 stars and sell well? Hmm. Interestingly enough, this book is even worse than my example. If only, if only, I could give this less than zero. God help the gullible person who reads and believes this bull/crap of a book. Okay, sure this book is true, and guess what? The underground railroad had tracks, and the best ""Star Wars"" film is ""Spaceballs."" Come on, wake up and smell the coffee! Biographies don't have to be black or white, portraying a saint or a sinner. But portraying a gunned down hero as an alcoholic and abusive bigot is a bit overboard. There is a thing called balance you know..."
1,The worst piece of trash I ever read about somebody!,This guy should never show his face around Beatlefans! What kind of crap did this guy think he could get away with? The Star or the any of the tabloids are much more accurate than this! Don't waste your time or money or time reading this pile of junk! I have been a Beatlefan for 20 years and this book is a huge joke and an embarrassment to music in general!
1,Hated it.,"I am far from thinking that John was a saint. But every person I have met that has read this book has the same opinion. It is a character assasination. His entire book is like a tabloid- it's a page turner, and it's sordid and shocking- but you really gotta wonder how much is really true.I would not recommend this book."
1,Unbelievable Piece of Garbage,"I'll be the first to admit that (from what I've read and seen on videos, documentaries, etc.)John Lennon could be a real a**hole, but this book is ridiculous. It portrays Lennon as an inept, talentless lunatic. In my opinion, Lennon was far from perfect, but the claims in this book are just ludicrous."
1,awful....just awful,"Has any author ever felt more contempt for his subjects? It seems unlikely. You can almost hear Goldman hissing and sneering in the background as you read these pages. John and Yoko are presented as two really loathsome characters, and I guess I was supposed to come away from this reading experience despising the two of them, but I actually feel a lot of sympathy. Nobody deserves this kind of character assassination."
1,The Lives of John Lennon,"This book is full of exagerations and many falsities, i have done research on Lennon over the past few years and the book i feel gives a very good overview of his life would be ""Lennon: the defenitive biography."" I am not saying ""The Lives of John Lennon"" is just one big lie, it has truthful, and quite factual information, but it sensationalizes many incidents in his life."
5,Time and Distance,"I had heard of Albert Goldmanbecause he was famous for writing what was widely believed to be a vicious hatchet piece on Bruce Lee. I had recently acquired that piece. Now, nearly 40 yearsafter Lee's death, the blind idolotry and so forth, the piece seemed less like a hatchet job and more the product of clinical, unbiased, particle level research. With that, I decided to read the Lennon bio. Tough to take, as the truth often is, particularly about a cultural icon with whom one has grown up. That said, I bought only wanting to read about the early years in Hamburg. Once I started the book I could not put it down. Not a pretty story. It was sort of like a dog walking on a train track. You know it is going to end but you can't look away."
4,"Provocative to say the least, Disturbing overall","Occasionally, I have red a novel powerful or so contraversal that I had to set it aside, like a type of reader's ""Time out"".This was such a book. Never had a read of a life so bizarre, a life so conflicted and tormented from a man so very talented. Not to mention the unfortunate early family life, one can only wonder how any person could cope with all the chaos in John Lennon's life. He marries a woman (Yoko) who, according to this novel is as mentally afflicted with drug and adjustment as he is.From a page turner review, this rates high. You want to read just what can happen next, and relish in the life of someone so unreal. You feel awkward, as I love this man, for his talent and his music, but I realize this is just a speculative book and certainly no absolute.It is a provocative page turner, but be prepared to see some extremely disturbing events and recreations. It may just make you want to put the book down for a while."
3,Thoroughly entertaining hatchet job,"Make no mistake - Goldman is out to de-mythologize John Lennon, and who knows; if half of the things Goldman wrote about Lennon were true, maybe John deserves to be defrocked. The problem is that Goldman never shies away from tossing in his opinions, however arbitrary. Abbey road was not a mediocre hodgepodge of songs; the Beatles' musicianship had not deteriorated by the end of their career together; John's relationship with Julian was not as simple as depicted. Goldman has thoroughly researched Lennon's life, but he slants it in an unfavorable light."
2,you can't tell which parts to believe,"Any John Lennon fan knows that there are many facets to the man who wrote ""Give Peace a Chance"" and ""All You Need is Love,"" including a mean streak and a propensity for violence. However, in ""The Lives of John Lennon"" so much of the story is Goldman's armchair psychology. The author puts a negative slant on every aspect of John's life. It is difficult to know how much is fact and how much is made up in the mind of the author."
1,"Meanest, Nastiest Slam Of A Dead Person I've Ever Seen","I picked this book up having never heard of it and thinking it might be a nice way to read more about the life of one of the 20th century's great musical geniuses, John Lennon. WRONG! This terrible excuse in slandering a murder victim who cannot speak for himself is disgusting beyond words. This is the lowest, meanest tabloid-esque exercise in character assassination I've personally ever seen set to print. How did this ever get published? What person would knowingly buy this? (I unwittingly got it at a library.) I didn't finish this trash talking badly-penned mongering of gossip and I hope this review persuades someone who might have unknowingly strayed toward this evil piece of maliciousness to find a different book."
1,This book is ridiculous,"I grew up with the Beatles and am quite fascinated with them, especially John Lennon. I went to the library and was excited to take out an extensive biography on Lennon. I couldn't finish it. The book is obviously a distorted version written by someone who hates the Beatles, especially Lennon. In the first 100 pages that I read, not a SINGLE good word (?). 2 examples, amongst many: Goldman describes John as ""clapping like a seal and stomping his club foot"" on stage during a concert; Goldman puts down all their music, for instance the music of ""All You Need is Love"" is no more than a variation of ""Three Blind Mice"". I certainly wanted to read an in-depth study on Lennon, including his weaknesses, but I must discredit this one by its one-sidedness. It's a shame."
2,A horrible book by a horrible man... but still,"It is a hatchet job based on hearsay within hearsay. albert is an untalented, jealous hack. i can't wait for someone to write his biography.however, the book is interesting in so far as it does a pretty good job of discussing the apple fiasco / management suits which ultimately led to jacko owning the publishing rights.good bathroom literature -- you can use it to wipe when you are done."
1,"At least he`s dead, so he can`t write more crap!","Just another wanna be somebody, using the tired old trodge stuff.Like a previous bright lad said, `Heresay`.Wonder why they don`t consider self immolation to get attention....now THAT would be worth reading about. AND we could bring chestnuts. As for George nicking somebody elses song....oh dear.And of course, the only place that the Beatles went, was america.Typical yank author..two places in the world. america and notamerica.Toilet paper might work if the ink isn`t as cheap as the scribbler. Not worth a zac.BTW the software advised that I HAD to award this crud with at least one star or the review would not get posted...hence the one star where I gave it minus 5 stars (idea would be to give us a choice of bouquets or brickbats doncha think??)"
1,how make money with a myth.,"IMHO John Lennon was one of most talented musician in past century.He was creative in his music as Mozart, Bach, Ellington , and few others.He was a fragile man too, and had his weakness: this book has to do with these. People that wants to know the smell of his s*** from a close view is welcome.No more to say."
1,Burn It,I can't imagine how this kind of publicity makes his family feel. John's not here to respond to these allegations. I found out after reading this that Albert Goldman's book is banned from all BeatleFests. Some places have had book burnings. This unecessary and nasty read is no longer on my shelf. It is the most disrespectful and cruel hearted thing to speak of such a beautiful man and artist who is no longer with us.
3,Insightful in spite of itself,"Albert Goldman was trying to be lurid, there's no doubt about it. His writing style and choices of focus reflect that. Nevertheless, he did do extensive valuable research, and come up with some good insights - most notably in his description of Lennon as embodying the paradoxical personality of the Beatles as a whole, and his belief that LSD contributed to Lennon's ability to participate in the good vibes of the sixties when he himself was an angrier character. The chapter about his childhood is also good. In the edition I read, there were a few appalling lapses in need of editorial correction, like when later in life we are told that Lennon meets some woman on the beach who would haunt him somehow, and that he would not see again for many years... then it never mentions her again. I still don't know what Goldman was talking about there. It sounded interesting, I wish it had been included. All in all, a good read if taken with salt."
5,Truth,"John Lennon has been and will always be my favorite artist and someone i look up to very much. When i chose to read this book it was because i wanted to fully understand John Lennon. He was a great icon in the 60s and the 70s and did many things for peace and happiness, but i know this. I know what hes done in the public eye. What people don't seem to understand is that although he was a great man he was also a rock star. In the sixties none the less and drugs, sex, and lies play a hugh part in a rock stars life. For those of you who want to have that perfect image of Lennon remain in thier mind, don't read this book. Although it has not affected my views on Lennon, being that he is still the biggest icon/idol for me, it does not hold back any punches, and tells you about the truth behind music's biggest name."
1,I'm ashamed I had to give it one star.,"As time goes on, the truth about Mr. Goldman's ""research"" is becoming known. It turns out, he didn't conduct the 1,200 interviews and rarely talked to people who were closest to John Lennon. Even in a period of his life when McCartney couldn't speak a good word about Lennon, he still came out publicly to say that most of this book is bogus. Claiming to know intimate facts about Lennon's family life, times where only Lennon, Ono, and Sean were present, Goldman makes it all to obvious that he's simply making up garbage in order to sell books. Just because I am a Lennon fan doesn't mean I think he is a great guy, but I still think that someone doing a biography should be more resposible than this. This guy ranks lower than Oliver Stone."
3,"Interesting book, don't believe everything you read though...","Read this book years ago and have always been a big Beatles/Lennon fan. As a book on it's own a very good read and the author keeps you interested throughout. However this book smacks of more than a little sensationalism and the claims about John being bisexual have never been proven, people who were around him through various stages of his life have disputed this claim. Goldman also wrote a biography about Elvis Presley which was less than flattering and has the same kind of spin that this book has. I'm not saying the author fabricated a lot of it, but take into consideration how much of the book is proven fact and how much is speculation. Certainly the antidote to the free love hippy image that Yoko has tried to maintain all these years. I give it 3 stars on entertainment value alone."
3,Not the last word but interesting,"The emotional subtext of the late Mr. Goldman's book is ""John Lennon was an anti-Semite, so take this!"" Which is a valid emotion if a true assesment of Lennon's character but the book fails to be good because it is a relentles trashing. Also, it appears that portions of hte book were not written by the same author as he at times seems to concede Lennon's talent, then dismiss it. (His portrayal of Yoko Ono as an amoral and deeply disturbed psychotic feels true to me but it may be unfair.) Even if the overall portrait is true, if Lennon was indeed a self-hating, bigoted, overrated, violent lunatic, it only puts him in the club of most great artists. There is probably alot of true dirt here, but it is nto the last word on a man who by all encounters seemed witty, engaging, and even humble in candid moments as well as moments of performance."
5,She's just a devil woman,"I was never a fan of Yoko so I guess I am biased but after reading this book I have to wonder about her affection for John. I read this book because I hear there is a new ""scandalous"" book about John out and I wanted to compare notes. If it beats this one, it is a doozy. I feel sorry for John if this was really his life."
2,Completely Changes Everything,"Before reading this book, my picture of Lennon was of a man, true to his beliefs, a great artist who loved what he did and a wonderful family man (to Yoko and Sean anyway) This book completely changes your whole perspective of him. For anyone reading this book, don't make it your first glimpse at John Lennon, as it is a harsh version of his life. Read something a bit more sugar sweet first. Not recommended for average Lennon fans, who know him as a great musician and honest man. The only reason I gave it two stars was for its detail. Just a very true, but disheartening book."
1,"Putrid, Poisonous, Infuriating","I can understand why I picked up this book in a bargain bin, it's simply awful. That might sound harsh, maybe, but once you start reading this book, you'll understand why I'm so critical of this trash. I was a third of the way through the book before I gave up altogether. Racism, bigotry, homophobia, hysterical overwriting...Goldman's obvious aim is to simply try and destroy a legendary figure. I recognise that Lennon wasn't a saint, but there should be a fair play for a dead man. Goldman does not provide it.Oscar Wilde once said: ""A man in life has many disciples, but it is always Judas who writes the biography."" That explains this book perfectly. If you are are looking for a biography of Lennon, I refer you to Ray Coleman's excellent, thoughtful study."
1,"""Tabloid Trash""","The validity of this book compares to the validity of every loony story in those tabloid magazines. Goldmans references are uncredible, and he robs Lennon of his dignity in this book. Most any other source on Lennon portrays completely the opposite. I think that Goldman's book should be sold by taking an ad out in 'The National Enquirer"" or some other trash talking paper."
2,"if this is true, i don't care!!!!!","Maybe john lennon was a villain who the world never found out about. But the way this book was presented, it sounded like lennon was 100% evil, 0% genius. It also sounded more like a tabloid cover story than an in-depth biography."
2,Unfair.,"Although my opinion is biased, being a life long Lennon fan, I still feel that Goldman unfairly painted a bleak picture of a social icon, just because John Lennon was exactly that. I guess it's easier to defame the deceased, they can't defend themselves. It's also easier to write a biography with out actually interviewing the people who were there, it allows for more freedom with plot development. Goldman should recieve some credit where it is deserved. Though fictional, his work did invoke the response of many readers throughout world. I give him two stars for sensationalism."
3,important read for a real fan,"I found this book at a vintage bookstore in Nova Scotia on vacation. It was cheap, long, and seemed like a good read for the long drives ahead of me. Although I seriously doubt that everything said about John is true, it is important to remember that John was troubled, he was genius, but troubled. When I bought this book I had no idea of the author's intentions nor his reputation and was shocked by what I read. As a life long John Lennon and Beatles fan, this was not the first account of his life that I have read but believe that it is an important perspective for a real fan. I do not take all of this as true, but understand what it is, a different way of seeing someone that I have idolized. The most interesting biography of John I have read is ""Come Together"" by Jon Weiner. This book is a biography of John's generation and the time he lived in, with John as the main character. The opening lines are enough to draw you in ""Is rock revolutionary?"""
1,"If only I could give it a more suitible rating- ""0""","This is the worst example of biography there has ever been . I first read this book a year ago - and couldn't finish it . I've heard of poetic justice- but this one really pushes it w/ ""information"" I'm sure the author found chiseled into a run-down men's room wall . It's a wonder the other Beatles wouldn't comment or allow an interview for this book . What is wrong with this guy ? Couldn't he say one good thing about Mr.Lennon ? And though I'm sure that the dates are correct ( they are common knowledge to Beatfreaks ) I'm gonna take a shot in the dark and say that the rest wasn't . and in closing , I think I can shed some light on who the author might really be - Mark David Chapman himself , in sheeps clothing . You want a real look at lennon ? Read "" Skywriting by Word of Mouth"" It gives you a real look at the man who gave us ""Imagine"" and ""Strawberry Fields"""
4,Overrated,"Great band, but not a very good selection of tunes in my opinion. This band is better represented elsewhere. However, you should buy it for Brown shoes, which manages to get a thorough reworking and still sound alarmingly similar to that great 1967 version. Hasn't lost any of its relevance either."
3,Some good stuff here,"TTR is worth buying for ""Pick Me I'm Clean"" and ""The Young Sophisticate""! There is some other good stuff here too but those two are standouts for me. Another version of ""Peaches ..."" is a bonus."
3,"Live Zappa, mixed album",Tinseltown Rebellion includes several excellent songs particularly the wonderful 'fine girl' and 'tell me you love me'. Other classics include 'peaches and regalia'. It offers some funny live recordings from a concert with 'the dance contest' Overall it's a solid live album but doesn't hit the heights of 'Overnight Sensation' or 'Apostrophe'
2,Weak,"You see, all reviews on this page are positive, but I gotta warn you: this album isn't generally very high-rated among Zappa fans! It sounds a little bit messy (especially ""Brown Shoes Don't Make It"" - really horrible version of that song), synths are horrible-sounding , there is a lot of filler (spoken tracks or some boring melodies like Easy Meat or Fine Girl), and drummer Vinnie Colaiuta is nowhere as great as on Joe's Garage or Shut Up and Play... Yes, there are a few good (not great) songs - for example the title track, one of a few really tight songs here, but most of this album sounds like an half-mess or very minimalistic on Zappa standards. And I also could live without new versions of some oldies - they're mostly OK, but originals are better, or MUCH better (Peaches III, Brown Shoes)."
1,Easily among Zappa's worst efforts,The most disposable and forgettable of Zappa's efforts. Even the recycled material from earlier - and much better albums - comes off very weakly against even weaker new material. Don't bother.
3,Good Story Theme -but sad,"It was about second chances and had a happy ending; however, the bulk of the movie was about all the mistakes the family members made. I was glad for the happy ending but it took a long time to get there."
2,Not really stirring Blu Ray,"I was hoping for a tear jerker, something that would move me but alas it didnt really have that ingredient. It tried and hoped you would be moved, but it was very shallow imho. The Blu ray is nothing exceptional, I think it would be identical to the DVD. If you want to get this get the double feature for the same price even if not blu ray. Absolutely no extras in fact no menu to go to. As I said nothing special. 2 stars for effort."
3,Angel in the Family,"Story was good, but definitely a fairy tale. Plot addressed common problems within many familys. Issues were resolved."
2,Soso movie,The idea of reconciliation and completing loose ends is good but many don't have a second chance after they die!a soso movie with a peaceful feel except when the psychological monster fights with her sister.
3,Green by Design,"Although I am very much a supporter of green products and design, I found this book a little too outdated. Most of the ideas in this book I have heard before. I found that this book was similar to most of the other books I have read concerning green building. I just picked up ""Green Remodeling"" recently by David Johnston and Kim Master, and find the ideas much more updated and applicable to modern home design"
3,Outdated Book,"I agree with Bill below - this book is outdated. The author seems to miss the concept of ecological footprint. The first two houses she features in her book are 3,300 sq ft (for three people) and 3,000 sq ft (for two people). Another house is 4,175 sq ft.Even if people use green materials and building practices, the houses aren't green if they're using excessive materials and space.There are a number of better green books, but one that specifically focuses on minimizing environmental impact is Little House on a Small Planet by Shay Salomon."
2,"Oops, my bad...","I bought the wrong size...this is REALLY tiny. And it's really not worth returning it, so it will just sit in the back of the cupboard for the rest of time, I suppose! However, the bigger version I was initially after, I love. I actually have been using the bigger one for a year--ideal for Tian recipes. However, it isn't quite as sturdy as you might expect from Corningware and easily chips...which is why I was in the market to replace it."
3,Argh.,"As the previous reviewer mentioned, although this book neatly summarizes the historical development of Japanese dietary patterns and symbolism, its price is much higher than one might consider reasonable. This makes the lack of an index an especially egregious flaw; although the table of contents is reasonably informative, it doesn't provide an adequate substitute.If you absolutely must have a single-volume reference on the subject, this would certainly conserve space on your bookshelf, but I suspect that most people would consider their money better-spent if spread across several different books that add up to the same total price."
4,The Movie's Better,"This soundtrack was ok, but it's missing Sheena Easton's ""Morning Train (Nine to Five)""! That was disappointing. But ""Scotty Doesn't Know"" is the highlight of this cd. ""Make My Dreams Come True"" is another one of my favorites."
3,too much good stuff left out,"[quote]4 out of 5 stars Sound track is good...but whats the name of that german song, April 2, 2005Reviewer: James Fisher (Detroit, MI USA) - See all my reviewsthe soundtrack was verygood...but who performed the german song when cooper was in club Vandersexx??? Ya know the one were the two butcher looking dudes were comming out and it started somthing like..eins, zvei, drie and it was real heavy metal like tune, sounded somthing like rammstien. [/quote]Probably ""Tanz mit Laibach"" by Laibach. An awesome song!"
3,what is the name of the song??,"I just wanted to say i loved the movie and the soundtrack it pretty awesome. Im frantically searching for the techno/dance song in the movie, when Cooper is walking through the Red light District, on the way to Club Vandersexxx. It's a real short clip, but its driving me nuts looking for the name of the song.If anyone can help, that would be much appreciated"
4,eurotrip review,"the movie first off, was just hilarious. i laughed a lot during the whole film. jacob pitts(cooper harris) is amazing. ""the scotty doesn't know"" song was good, in some strange way, and that's one of the reasons i bought the CD. another good track was ""my generation"""
3,the song before club vandersexxx,topdawg if you haven't already found out that song is The Bad Touch - Bloodhound Gang...great bass line :-)
2,not a bad movie..,"To start off, the movie was hilarious, trying to emulate the more successful movies such as american pie and obviously 'ROAD TRIP', and i think it did a good job. As for the soundtrack it was disappointing and unappealing, there was one song i was hoping was on the soundtrack, it was when Cooper was eyeing Jennie taking off her coat in the night club, please if anyone knows what that song is called, if you can post it that would be great."
1,Not worth any money!,"First of all, ""Scotty doesn't Know"" is one of the stupidest songs i've ever heard. It may be catchy, but its more of the annoying-kind of catchy.Also, the Business song played is called ""Guinness Boys"", in the scene with the skinheads. It would make sense, seeing how they are in a pub.Does anyone know what song is playing during the robot scene at the end of the movie? Please let me know."
4,Good but... I'm a little disappointed.,"Ok so I saw the movie, and i really liked all the songs they played. So i said, Great let me get the soundtrack so I can tap my foot along with these songs at home instead of embarrassing myself in the theatre again.Well.. the songs on here are good, but some of the really good and catchy tunes arent on the cd. The song ""Bad Touch"" isn't on it (by the Bloodhoundgang"", as well as that funky song that is also in the soundtrack to National Lampoons European vacation. The songs on here are great, dont' get me wrong. I""m just disappointed that they put David Hasselhoff on here instead of some of these other cool songs. Also the movie has tons of music and there are just 14 tracks on the cd (minus the 1 hasselhoff song:-P )So, if you are buying it in hopes that a particular song is on here, (other than the movie's theme ""Scotty Doesnt know""), chances are your song wont be on it. But if you like all the songs in the movie, and aren't picky, you cant go wrong."
3,"To Rakan ""Rakz""","The song in the club is ""Horndog"" & it performed by Overseer. Other songs that rockes were England 5, Germany 1 (by The Business) it was played when the MAN U. hooligans came on screen. Also ""Ca plane pour moi"" by Plastic Bertrand. I rememver this song from Europen Vacation back in 1985."
2,How can you call that the soundtrack to the movie?,"Do not expect the good songs from the movie to show up here. Sure, the Scotty song is there, twice. My advice is that you listen to the samples here before purchasing the CD. The samples don't lie."
3,"Decent, but lacking","Eurotrip was a really cool movie and worth seeing, and the soundtrack is okay, but for the love of God, where is the sound clip of Scott's New Mail notification? The (...) is the coolest part of the whole thing and friends of mine will watch it and skip back to that particular point. Of course this soundtrack doesn't have the PARENTAL ADVISORY label on it for better sales, but that's the coolest part of the whole flick! (Except for Matt Damon's concert)."
4,"""ozzy rules"", the name of the song is","the german metal/punk song is probably ""keine uberdosis Deutschland"" by normahl.although I cannot find a sample to verify this, I think this is the only metal/punk band listed.the business is more hooligan music"
4,Does anyone know this song.,"Does anyone know the name of the song that plays when the men come out in club vandersexxx. Its german and its starts out counting to 4 in german. Ince, Fye, Drye, Fear. (kind of like that)."
2,anyone know the college song?,anyone know the song played at the end scene where scotty is own the phone with cooper and hes just moving into his dorm room?
5,Best Golf Book ever,"I'm amazed that this golf book doesn't seem to have been recognised for the gem that it is. By far the best golf book there is, and I've read over 100. Boomer was WAY ahead of his time, and I'm convinced a lot of the more recent golf instruction authors have been influenced by his work. And yet, this book is still the best in communicating the feel of the golf swing."
1,allergies,"I developed a severe case of hives after eating this product for a month. I am not sure it's from the product, but the hives went away after I stopped eating it. I do eat a similar product from Maple Farms that doesn't give me the reaction. Although both products contain Gluten, I am told by my doctor that this product may have some ingredients that are different from Maple Farms. I'm sure not everyone would get this reaction, but I did and I wanted to put out a warning."
1,Yuck!!,"The reason I decided to purchase this item is because of the other positive reviews. But, after tasting it, I am not sure that the other reviews have ever tasted a real pancake! These are yellow in color, have a gritty texture, and a eggy taste, sort of like French toast (and I HATE French toast). I am sure the rest of the box will sit on the shelves until it expires."
1,Doesn't taste like a pancake.,"I used to be a cook in college making eggs and pancakes for breakfast in the college dining hall. It wasn't actually gourmet but it at least was a pancake. I followed the directions to the letter on the box which wasn't too difficult but, like the others low rating reviews, it came out like a watery flat omelet. It had a strong taste of eggs, it didn't rise very well. I chucked the rest of the box out. You might get a better result if you cut the mix with a little regular flour or add more mix than recommended on the package, but I don't think its worth the effort. Better to just eat a normal pancake with sugar free syrup than this stuff."
2,Disappointing,"The pancakes looked good and rose up nicely. However, they tasted like egg which I hate. I was disappointed in the taste."
3,heavy,"These are pretty heavy and retain a taste of oil. Better than nothing, but certainly not good enough not to have to make the real deal for my 10 year old."
3,Pancakes again,"I can't say that these pancakes are the best I have ever had, but after not having any at all for awhile, they weren't bad!"
2,Tiny Box!,"I was shocked at the tiny box of product that I recieved when I ordered this mix. I really should have read the details better, buyer beware!"
5,See How God Works in the World!,"So many separate events --- the First World War, the ascension of Emperor Charles of Austria, the failure of his peace plan, the reign of Czar Nicholas of Russia, the shenanigans of Rasputin, the collapse of Russia's first revolutionary government and the rise of Lenin --- all these are tied together to show that God really is in control. The appearance of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Portugal in that fateful year of 1917 brings it all home. I have long been fascinated by the events of the Russian Revolution, but until I read this book I had only a vague notion of the pattern, the proof, that these were not just random events happening without reason. Human beings brought about the terrible First World War, and all the tragedies and disasters that led to Russia's fall to Communism. But God has managed to let all things work for good, ultimately. This is a fascinating and educational book. Enjoy it!"
2,The Message is good but...,"This message about a man's life who now does good things for others is good, but I wish there were not so many typos in the book, and there were not so much disturbing press available about the author. We should all help others, but prayer and faith are glaringly missing from this pedestrian self homage. I was also disturbed by all of the references to killing animals for sport."
3,Review,Songs adequate but not what I expected. Since I only play it at Xmas time I kept it. Okay item.
2,Anti-carols from 1950s,"Somewhat screechy recordings of clearly secular lascivious holiday-flavored early rock/R&B; will drive true believers crazy as they will say ""Santa"" really is a mis-spelling of ""Satan"" here."
5,Practical and useful!,"I found TV Time to be very practical. At first I thought it might be another book that assumes I have a craft store in my house, but no. Not much is necessary beyond cardboard, paper, crayons, pencils, books, and the usual stuff you find in every house with a child in it."
2,It did not come with all the parts....,"the fan itself works fine, but the package did not come with the end caps to hold the fan together. the do not have contact info for the company on the website...if you buy it, go to a store, don't order it online."
1,cheap,"More like a child's plaything than a serious shop appliance. Every part of this thing is plastic. I sent it back immediately. There are much better fans for a bit more that are made of steal in America. Air King has a 14"" for $15 more."
4,Good Fan,This fan is working very well for me. It moves a lot of air and is not too loud on low speed. It moves about the same amount of air on low as a box fan on high. It has run about 12 hours a day for the last several months without issue. It is fairly easy to clean.
3,This is a commercial/industrial grade fan,"And I knew that when I bought it. Any potential buyers who might be noise-sensitive will not be happy with this fan. While it is extremely effective in moving/circulating air, noise levels range from tolerable on low speeds to downright overpowering when set to ""high"".We've owned the fan for a little more than a year and I have no other complaints with regard to function. This is a very durable fan that I hope will last many more years.NOTE: disassembly for cleaning is not easy; there are several (8+) screws to be removed for the front grille alone, and then another bolt to remove the blade assembly. To completely clean the rear grille/motor housing area would be a pain and so I cleaned those areas as best I could without removing them."
2,Vibrates on high.,"I bought this fan because of the sophisticated turbine style blade design that promised ""30% better performance compared to traditional 14"" box fans"". I can't speak to the performance level, but on high, the blades vibrate badly. I would guess the manufacturer does not take steps to balance the blades. Will be returning this fan."
3,Sign of the Times,"I have been a fan -- no pun intended -- of Patton floor fans for at least a decade. So when my former Patton finally twirled its last, my only thought was to replace it. Bear in mind, I'd not had to buy a Patton fan for the past five years -- at least. While the present incarnation of the Patton still circulates and cools the air admirably, I find there has been a downgrading and skimpiness in its components. The wire caging on front of the appliance feels cheaper, flimsier and less durable. The power cord is a ridiculous 2 feet long, if that. It will be impossible to use this fan at any distance without an extension cord. The cord and plug both feel cheap and insubstantial. Curiously, the former three-prong plug has been replaced with a two-prong. The only thing that Patton has not reduced is the price -- sign of the times."
2,T-Bird Fan 2012,"This fan is not as durable or as powerful as the manufacturer claims. This fan shakes on medium and is not as well made. 30% more air circulation than a conventional fan....please back this up. For 62 bucks delivered we got ripped off (at least 40 bucks worth). The 2 prong cord is just one prong short. Made in China is self explanatory. What ever happened to quality, durability and customer satisfaction? This fan is about making a profit and caring less about consumer satisfaction and loyalty.The reviews on Amazon are old and not as useful. Clearly Amazon needs to improve this part of their web site. Amazon should provide links to products.Will never fall for this again. Written on June 2012"
4,Kenshin is Amazing but Season 3 is a bit odd,"In my opinion this third season was not at all needed. It has some amazing stories in it however many of them were not needed nor to the quality of the rest of Rurouni Kenshin.I still think that this is worth the money, and don't be fooled by the 70-80 dollar Full boxed sets on Ebay, those are illegal boot legged copies. If you're into to supporting that kind of crap then go for it. But anyone who wants the real thins will be happy with the money spent on the Real version.This is a good buy, however if you are into season 2 and stongly feel that it is the best season then you may want to invest in the OVA's at least Trust and Betrayl, AND MAKE SURE THEY ARE NOT THE DIRECTORS CUT!! They kinda botched some things up. The Widescreem implimentation means that they simply cut off some of the top and bottom of the frame, because the OVA was drawn in Pan and Scan format."
2,Untrue to the Series,"This third installment of Rurouni Kenshin is all right, but not great. It has the same good ole humor, but the enemies are very different. The previous episodes tried to be somewhat realistic in their action and events, nothing very magical. In the Meiji Era, though, the events were extremely far fetch, from finding the Elixir to the flow of this huge electic wave of Chi running all over Japan. All strings to reality were chopped off.The Legend of Kyoto had a fantastic ending with a huge, epic battle. Unfortunately, the series never reached the same amount of adrenaline in action. It didn't even come close. I also greatly missed Saitou. I never saw him again after Legend of Kyoto. He made the set of characters perfect with his awesome lack of pity.If you want to keep a good impression of Ruruoni Kenshin, do not buy this DVD box. If you must know how it ends, then borrow it from a friend."
4,The circle is complete...,"The Meiji Era is kind of like the first season - lots of small stories put together with a few episodes that stand alone. Christian cults, German knights, Ninja clans, more fighting styles (some even from Europe). The art work, camera style and appearance of some characters from the other seasons helps bring it all together even with the lack of a season long story. The last episode's use of real photographs and film footage mixed with the anime cells really brings it to a lovely and heart warming close.The wandering samurai, Rurouni Kenshin, returns to the place where he started in the first season. A place he can call home."
4,Hopefully not the last.,Iam a real fan of rurouni kenshin from 2003-2004 and I'm glad its not short because I like collecting a lot of DVD's and to learn more about the series. This side of the story is called tales of the meiji era and it deals with a lot of religious stuff and hard to imagine why. There are alot of funny stuff like when an artist falls in love with Kaoru and other stuff like that. The only thing I don't like about this box set is that there are only 33 episodes in this which there were suppodes to be 34 in this side of the series. Either the creators are finnaly making the Jinchu Arc or they are just tryin to get you get pissed off and get the LAST DVD just for one DVD. I am not reccommending this unless you are a real rurouni kenshin fan Like I am. Get this if you want to I don't really care.
5,Wonderful Book,"This is a wonderful book. Don't let the South African setting turn you away, if you do, you'll miss one of the best romances of the year. Great story, super characters, and a romance that will put a smile on your face."
5,Works great but be careful!,"I do a fair amount of industrial type macro shooting to things down to 1/1000 of an inch. I use a modified copy stand and a Nikon bellows and 50mm reversed lens. I bought this to try in the moderate macro range and it works well but BE CAREFUL! What they don't tell you is that you cannot use it much below 45mm focal length because of the retro-focal design the subject will have to be BEHIND the front of the lens. I use an 18-180 most of the time so half the focal length is unusable and I cannot use my wide angle at all. But taking that into consideration, it works very well at 50mm and above. So don't even think of getting a 35mm macro for use with this extension tube. That said, I am still learning how to use it best and plan to couple it with the 50mm macro lens. Should be a great combo. I would like to see a set of such extensions: say a 10mm and a 40mm for more flexibility."
3,Great Extension,Another fine quality product from Olympus. Recommend this extension highly for those who have the Zukio 500mm Macro Lens to get the 1:1 ratio for the true Macro shot.
4,Watch Out,"I bought this lens as an add-on to my 14-45 Olympus lens. I wanted to get a bit closer on macro shots. Buried in the instructions it warned the user to be careful not to touch the lens on subjects your were shooting. And they were correct! You get within an inch or so of what your shooting so do be careful. And, to make this lens (and you) work at it's best remember a tripod and maybe a remote shutter button. For the price it is a great add-on for macro shooters."
5,Well Worth the Money,"If you are into macro photography, then this is a must have. I searched for lesser expensive tubes, but cheaper ones don't have the quality and features such as coupling for automatic that this does."
3,"A good plot, but it could have been told better.","I read the reviews of others, and it seems the most enthusiastic are familiar with other works by this author on this character Cole. This is my first encounter with the series. The start is fantastic, and due to the style of writing, absorbing the cast of characters was easy. Yet, I don't feel particularly thrilled enough to recommend this book, nor do I feel inspired to check any other installments of ""Cole & the Gang"" <---(I thought I'd be clever...) All in all, it was an average book of it's genre. I was more excited reading the Harry Potter books."
2,a big disappointment,"This book started out with such a bang that I was sorely disappointed when it degenerated into such a clunky writing style shortly thereafter. Mr. Holton is in bad need of an editor; there's a good story here, but its clumsy execution keeps getting in the way. Not only that, but the title is a ripoff of a sci-fi classic, The Left Hand of God."
5,Works as advertised,This gratin dish is exactly as advertised and also easy to clean and attractive for serving.
4,Good price alright product,theres only a couple things wrong with this tv 1. takes about 10 seconds to turn on which i dont mind at all you jus get used to it after a while 2.little lines at the side of the screen vertically when the screen is black it just bugs the helll out of me. as for going throught the video to tv again you dont even have to continue to go through and end up at channel 1 just hit whatever channel u want to watch and your there. picture and sound is great once you fiddle with it for about 5 minutes. I like how it looks so tiny in the store next to those huge 52 inchers but you bring it home and itsa like ...... wow . well thats my imput and I really like the tv.
4,Its a hammer...,i love this hammer. in this day and age of nail guns i hardly ever use a hammer anyways. i find it easier to carry the lightest hammer possible.like the other reviewer said the heads were loose on both of mine. but all it takes is a second to drive the pin into the handle from the top of the hammer. mine loosen every once in a while but i use them just about every day.this is a trim hammer don't try to use it for anything other then trim. i switch to a 24 oz waffle face for framing and a 16oz smooth for decking and other jobs were a waffle may be a problem and this 8 oz is to small.overall for ~$20 this is a great trim hammer.
4,Very Nice Vanilla Flavor,"I tried this coffee for the 1st time and have enjoyed it immensely.Many vanilla coffees I have tried from the grocery store have been toostrong or had an overwhelming caramel flavor.This has a subtle, true, vanilla flavor and it is very smooth.This has become my new vanilla coffee and it is half the price I waspaying from another company."
5,Lots of flavor,I'm putting this one in the same category as the Eight O Clock Vanilla coffee. We interchange these depending on availability of the Coffee Masters brand.
2,very high price for very little,"This is a very small, rather superficial overview of key features and functions of Matlab - essentially an abbreviated printout of Matlab help.It can be useful as quick look-up elementary level reference.But just as quickly its limited scope becomes apparent.This is an eighth edition - and yet it is full of uncorrected typos and misprints. Obviously the publisher did away with a proofreader, and the author never bothered to review & correct his own work. Given the tiny size of the book, and the very high price, I had expected better quality.The best thing about the book is the pretty cover page. Very effective at attracting and fooling the customer."
2,too little for too high a price,"I should have read the other reviews before ordering this. I didn't realize just how small it would be. It will probably be useful, but considering the size and age, it should cost about half this much."
3,Matlab Primer,"Great pocket book, lots of useful stuff in it, easy to read, and a few examples in it are pretty helpful. Recommend this pocket book highly, although should be accompanied by another Matlab intro if new to the subject."
3,"Yeah, yeah, it was OK, I guess.","I was going to give this book 2 stars, but upped it to 3 stars because the hero was pretty darn eccentric and funny. (His obnoxious outbursts in a fancy restaurant and then ballet performance were particularly hilarious!)The problem I had with this book was that it was pretty much a re-make of Palmer's own '80s ""Diamond Girl"", with just a few elements swapped around. In ""Diamond Girl"" the girl was the one who had the makeover (i.e ""Diamond in the rough""). In ""Diamond Girl"", the hero had the dead wife that he secretly mourned. Blah blah blah.Since I happened to read both these books back-to-back, the similarity was quite obvious. Do all of Diana Palmer's book go over the same theme, over and over again? I sure hope not.Both books had the ""oh my gosh, I am burning with the desire of a thousand flames for you, but I'm too [messed] up to admit it to you"" thing going on.Yeah, yeah, yeah. Whatever."
3,Too heavy,"I have an Amitron watch that I love and wear often. I thought this watch would be about the same. It is very heavy on my arm. I still wear it and do like the fact that it is water resistant, as I am a nurse, but as soon as I get home, off it comes."
4,"great ! ..... well,almost","this movie is basically an introduction to the anime hit galaxy express 999,its too bad that theyve made this movie many years after galaxy express which might make it pointless to watch.However,combining the story of both of them make a enjoyable anime.But if you plan to watch this movie alone then youll feel just like the rest reviewers"
2,DISGUSTING,"If you are the ""GE 999"" fan (I am) - your impression about the Matsumoto's universe will be poisoned.No important mysteries are revealed. And what's revealed - doesn't fit the original GE 999 story (or simply made me sick)! It seemed to me that all characters have been americanised. Yes, Maetel and Emeraldas are shown as regular american-like teens. (even without turning the english speech on :) The film is dull, the only emotional scene of Queen Millenia loosing her humanity is shown maaany times the same way and so on... The author had nothing to tell us. Verdict: it's not for general audience (2 boring), even not for schoolgirls (violence). And of course, it's not for fans (I tell U!). Suitable for those of Matsumoto's fans who are tired of life - this will give them strenght to commit the suicide."
3,only for Matsumoto/Galaxy Express 999 fans,"This DVD is a really nice transfer, where the animation is very sharp and crisp. However, for a casual anime fan, this is a rather slow moving story. If you're a fan of the Galaxy Express 999 or Captain Harlock, you'll enjoy this tale about Maetel and Emeraldas as teenagers, which is really two 45-minute OAVs put together on this DVD.Somewhat barebones DVD, just some character profiles, some brief notes on Leiji Matsumoto, a hokey trivia game, and some trailers to other CPM titles.Unless you're a die-hard Matsumoto fan, I'd recommend renting this before buying it."
3,Presentation of 999 prequel,This video presents many answers not put forth in Galaxy Railways 999. It tells the story of Maetel and Emeraldas before the sequels Harlock Saga and 999 series. It is worth the price and is of good quality.
3,Interesting Christmas read,"You've read all the classic Christmas stories already? Maybe not this one, which contains a number of details that helped to form Christmas traditions as we know them today. An interesting read, but not really great for plot or delving deep into character. It's a lark kind of piece, but fun for the holidays."
1,Worked for less than three years,"I bought the RCA TruFlat 27F522T less than 3 years ago, and it worked fine until a few months ago, overnight, the color bleached out. I have manipulated the color/brightness/tint, etc. settings through every possible combination, but nothing works. It looks like an overexposed photograph, with DVD/VHS/TV--no difference. I have a 12-year old Sony that still works perfectly that was in the same relative price range."
1,Beware of the buzzing noise!,"The picture is excellent and that is about all that is good about this TV. It has an annoying loud buzzing noise whether it's turned on or off, that I can actually hear in the next room. I've checked online and other people have had the same problem.I agree with the other reviewer that RCA support is a pretty bad. They said that the loud buzzing noise is normal. I told them that this is the only TV in the world that you can hear in the next room even when it's turned off."
1,Hunk of junk,"I bought this T.V to replace an older Sharp T.V. I had only had this T.V for 6 months when it decided to have a mind of its own. The picture would go out, however the sound would stay on. You could hear the channels turning on its own. Once you unplugged the T.V and turned it back on it would be fine, for about a day or too, till eventually it quit working. Well, I had the T.V repaired for $200. (yes, I got ripped off)and 6 months later the same problem it happening again. This $300+ T.V is now a $500+ T.V. I will never buy another RCA again."
1,Wouldn't recommend,"We have also had a problem with the TV turning itself on after a power outage or flicker. We live in a part of the country where this is a weekly to daily occurrence (especially in summer). My husband finally reached customer support and was told it was a manufacturing issue, but offered no other help or information. Additionally, the tube or color-guns seem to have become slightly mis-aligned, with a vertical line near the left edge. We wish we would have never bought this TV. We found these reviews too late, unfortunately. Stay away from this TV."
5,Agh! Two one-stars?,"I've had this TV for a year now - great TV, very affordable, superb picture. Got this baby hooked up with some Monster 3 Component Vid cables...DVD quality is amazing. No buzz; the reviewr that mentioned this must must have a defect in that particualar model. No loss of picture.Good product. Seriously. Don't beleive the other two reviewers.Email me at Steve5805@yahoo.com if you want more info.-Steve"
1,Piece of S**t,I bought this tv at WalMart 3 yrs ago for $300 and the thing is now busted. It turns itself on and off repeatedly. Awesome.
4,"An Excellent Set, But I Do Wonder About Something...","I have had this set for some time and it has worked wonderfully. The picture and sound are both superior to any other I've owned. The only problem I've experienced is whenever the power goes off and comes back on, the television will come on even when it was off when the power went out. I recently had the power in my home flicker several times and the TV continued to turn off snd on. I am worried that this may damage the television or start a fire and I was wondering if anyone else has had this experience. Every other television in my home as well as all the sets I've owned previously have stayed off during an outage. I've attempted to contact RCA only to get an automated help system, which lead me nowhere."
1,Are you for real ?????????????,"Wow it is sooooo obvious that all thease reviews were submitted by the same person!! i bought this book, this is one of the worst books ever about trading (i have read alllllot of books) it seems if the author hired a 4yr old and asked him to make a trading method. The method that he talks about can be obtained on any trading forum for free. As for the method it self it is not worth the price of the book at ALL!!! and most trader's even if your new to trading probably allready know it.If your looking for a profitable method look elsewhere."
3,"a good idea but not a good system, needs more improving","It can't be a good trading system since market can't be predicted precisely. How can you define a swing or a hard mid term drawdown? or even to know the trend is over. No body knows. Nevertheless, he offers a very good idea to help trader how to predicate the market behavior. It is still worthy to study, but can't work as a trading system. It's too rigid to trade with this system."
2,Concepts are different from Examples,"The problem I have with this book is that the author explains the setup in pages before, which is great, but as you read more and more into the book, the examples do not follow the original setups. Therefore, it leaves the reader scratching their head. The subject of this book is inticing, thats why I bought the book, but I don't feel it really adds any value overall."
1,useless,I am professional trader 15 plus years and this book is useless and will not help anyone make money. Don't waste your money.
1,Useless....,"I have LOTS and LOTS of trading books, and figure this one to be one of the most useless of the bunch. The presentation of ideas sounds fine .... the charts in the book, make it look like the ideas might be valid. BUT ..... just try and apply the idea to the current markets and see what that yields you ...... zippo!The problem with trading books, is that you have to put in effort to validate whether or not the ideas actually work or not .... and that takes TIME. This book is a good sales pitch for the ideas contained within it .... and that seems to be IT."
3,Not bad,The look is far better than the picture... it is well sealed... but slightly large :) i get this fix in no time... :D
2,Poor quality control,"This is a great tv when it works, but after about 6 months of owning it the color/picture started having problems when the tv was on more than 1 hour and you change input sources.I can play the xbox for about 2 hours before the picture starts to become un-stable, then if I change the input source the picture either becomes colorless or completely unwatchable.I think I'll hold out on RCA products until they prove they've overcome their quality control problems; just do a google search for: ""rca tv quality control problems""."
2,Too many errors,"This book contains an incredible number of mistakes. It would be a solid 3 (or maybe 4) star book if it wasn't for the many mistakes. The books is clear and easy to understand, but it breaks down with the practice problems. In addition to containing many mistakes, lots of the problems are poorly chosen: often there is no natural progression from simple problems to more complicated ones. I'm sure the book will be improved in subsequent editions, but I would not recommend this edition to anyone. I found it extremely frustrating to work on a problem for hours only to find that the problem was written wrong."
2,Review from a student using this book,"I found this book difficult to use. The book had errors in several places, the examples were difficult to understand at times, and the problems were also difficult to work through. I used the book in a differential equations course at the University of Victoria, and I found myself struggling to understand the material presented in the book. Many of the students in the same course agreed with me."
4,Exellent,This was a wonderful book. It followed Madeliene L'Engles writting style. It was discriptive interesting and entertaining. You won't be able to put it down. If you liked her other books you will difinetly love this one.
3,"raft so-so, oars a bust","The raft is fine for two adults; not as big as you might think given the weight capacity. On our first use, one of the oars broke and is unuseable. We will be purchasing better oars."
4,Decent for the price!,"Okay, as I'm sure everyone is aware of, this boat is rated 4 people by weight, not by volume. Some contents in the boat may have shifted during useage, resulting in less space than expected. I think this boat is a 2-2.5 person boat; meaning 2 people can fit in the boat with some gear if one of the individuals is holding the equipment the whole time. One thing I plan on doing before I next venture out again in this boat is buy an anchor! If it is windy, or there is a current, this boat tends to drift very easily. I took this boat fishing on a small lake, and I spent half the time rowing back out away from the shore! I'd get out to the drop-off, and after a few casts I found myself drifing back to shore! Due to the reasonable price, however, I can't really complain about much!"
2,LIGHT DUTY RAFT,"FIRST I BOUGHT IT,ONE OF A OAR IS ALREADY BROKEN,AND I TAKE IT TO A SMALL STREAM FOR A HALF HOUR THERE IS A SMALL HOLE GOING ON.IT IS NOT THE puncture-resistant AS DESCRIBE"
1,lasted 2 months! waste of money,"i dont know whether this was just my bad luck, but mine tore in just a month or two. i wanted to get out on the lake and fish, and an anytime inflatable rely sounded great, and easy. so i bought this raft, then 80 bucks, last summer. i probably used it les than ten times. i tried pumping it up once, i herd a leaking sound, but the time i found the leak, the boat blew up and the smal tear became a 3 foot tear. it wasnt my fault of overfilling, cuz the seam didnt tear, it was off the seam, and i didnt pop it, cuz it looked like the material actually just teared, and not punctured. by the way, this stupid boat is too smal for 4 people, and not much room for any other things like tackle. with no warranty, this product is crap, and useles, a waste of my 80 bucks. DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT, AND DONT BUY ANY OTHER JUST BECUZ IT SAYS GUARENTEE, LOOK FOR A WARRENTEE!!"
5,The Recipe For Sales Success,"This book is a great primer in the things every salesperson should master.Tracy is a master at communicating simply and shares the essence you need to know. Each chapter has exercises that help you put theory to work.In reading this book I realized I had many of the traits of super successful salespeople but not all. I was missing about 30% - what Tracy calls ""the winning edge"" - the critical differences that make big differences in salary.I have put many of the ideas to work immediately with very good results. By going to a two step selling process I am able to build great rapport with prospects and learn in-depth about their needs. And a bonus that I never thought: due to this rapport I received discounted services and a free $265 health evaluation that I really need. This on just the first sales call!Tracy's ideas confirmed many of my own selling instincts and taught me new ones.Try out the ideas you will see your life change."
2,"If she's so smart, how come she ain't rich?","She may have the highest measured IQ, but so what? What has she done with her life except write a brain-teaser newspaper column? What has she created that has changed the way the world thinks or feels? What work of hers will endure? Not a thing. If this is genius, I'm happy being normal."
3,"Excellent, although not cohesive, intro to statistics","This is really two books, one about the ""Monty Hall"" problem, and another one all about politics, campaign promises, and other ways the popular press gets it wrong. Is there a tie between the two? Yes. This could have been an excellent tome on how our emotions and our ""wants"" and our intuition often leads us astray, and how advertising, entertainment, and politics capitalizes on that. But somehow there is little connection between the two. I didn't find Vos Savant's ego to be the main theme of this book, in fact, she downplays herself many times. But other books, by authors like Sagan, Randi, Shick, Dawkins, and Shermer, cover this ground better."
1,very disappointing,"If you are looking for information around developing and improving critical/logical thinking, this is not the book you want to read. It doesn't contain solid methodologies/approaches and is merely a collection of examples of Logic problems and their solutions."
2,Best for couples with kids,"My husband and I have a great relationship, and we are always looking for encouraging devotionals to build us up, and even convict us in areas we need it. This one is ok, but highly geared toward couples with kids. We have only found a few devotionals that focus on the couple with out children, or make the couple the priority of the book. This one does not fit into that category. My husband and I thought it would be better titled for ""Moments together for couples with children"" since so much of the book focus on that are of a couples relationship."
4,An easy way to improve communication and intimacy,"After 25 years of marriage themselves and helping millions of others keep their marriage vows, Dennis and Barbara Rainey know what it takes to keep a marriage fresh, vibrant, and intimate. Moments Together for Couples is designed to be a ""first step"" toward better communication. Just 15 minutes a day is enough time to read a scripture passage together, a short essay by the Raineys, and discuss what you read. You'll quickly find that the time went by very quickly, and before you know it, you're spending even more time together.If you're a woman who works exhaustingly in the home with the kids and the house, you probably long from time to time for meaningful adult conversation. This is a great RX for you.This best seller (over 400,000 units) will remain fresh for years to come."
4,An Excellent Devotional Book,"My wife and I went through this devotional book during our first year of marriage and we found it really helpful in building our relationship.While it does have many references to child-raising, that didn't keep us from benefiting because it helped us think about some attitudes that we would like to change or develop before we have children.I really like Dennis and Barbera's honesty about their own marriage. They don't come across as having solved everything. They still get mad at each other on occasion. That's refreshing.Some of us who are a bit more conservative may find offense at some references to dancing and movies, but those are minimal and really do not detract from the whole of the book.I would really suggest this for your first year of marriage."
2,Fair to Decent,"This is a devotion written for couples in the beginning phases of their faith journey. There are large sections devoted to male ""misconceptions"", parental issues, and other such obvious things.My wife has concerns with the book because it seems to promote the stereotype that in a Christian relationship the male is supposed to be dominate and the wife is supposed to be subordinate. I have to say, it bugs me too. It can be a little irritating night after night.Lastly, the book seems to talk down to the read as if they are just beginning their faith journey. We have actually stopped reading the book after only a few weeks. Before anyone says anything, I have made these observations by reading through many of the other days to see if we should keep going or just stop...we just stopped.My recommendation is to skip this book if you have been together for a time, if you have been together for a while, have a good relationship, or are not just beginning your faith journey together."
5,Excellent Devotional for Couples with Children,"I love this devotional. I can honestly say - it has played a huge role in bringing us closer together as a couple. The theme doesn't always necessarily pertain to where we are in life - but it always gives us a great starting point for discussions. We've learned more about each other in 3 months of reading this than we have in 9 years of dating/marriage. Plus it gives great advice on raising children. It's definitely what I was looking for in a couple's devotional. I've personally recommended it to many of my friends, and will continue to do so."
1,"NOT for couples, this book is for parents only.","I was highly disappointed with this book - it is HEAVILY geared towards parents, and even pointedly says that couples who don't have children are not fulfilling their purpose. When the book stated that Take Your Daughter to Work Day was part of the feminist agenda, I gave up. There is a handful of devotions that are, in fact, geared towards couples. 95% of the book, however, is blatantly written for extremely conservative parents. The title of the book should convey that."
2,Relive those arguements...,"We've read through about 3/4 of this book and the one theme that seems to run through the whole book is that it is constantly asking you to relive past arguments. I realize there may be people with problems with unresolved conflicts, but we both felt that the book was TRYING to get us to fight! It has gotten to the point where we gloss over many of the daily ""discussions"". We will probably finish the book but I will not be reading it a second time."
4,Great for Married Couples,I heard alot about this book and read alot about it online. This is a great devotional! It puts couples face to face and talks about some hard topics that couples avoid during conversations. This devotional will help couples communicate better and say things to each other that needs to be said in the right way. This will strenghten your relationship with the one you love in a Christ like manner.
1,This book must've been written in 1950,"I bought this book hoping to develop a stronger 3-way relationship, God, my husband, and myself. Instead, I got an insulting book. This is not about ""marriage"" - its about 1950's values....the woman should become pregnant almost immediately, have sex with her husband whenever he desires it, and have no male friends, because that would be cheating. Haven't these people seen that the man and the woman in marriage are EQUALS....with the ""relationship"" they present, the man gets all he wants and the woman is left with nothing. Do yourself a favor and save your money - unless you feel like being smacked in the face by insulting values, don't buy this book."
4,a good track,"This track might not be the most positive of records, but as far as hiphop goes this song is tame. The beat is ILL. The rhymes are decent. And to the person that was kinda offended, relax for a moment. This is obviously a sex song. A very sexy one at that. And it works. This a song for adults, it isnt the artist's fault that it may be accessable to younger kids. This song is for adults who enjoy sex, really good hot, raw sex that yes sometimes hurts. Besides, its an expression, ever heard the song ""Hurts so good?""-John Cougar Mellencamp? I've had sex that was so good that hurt, have you?"
3,Apparently none of you have actually heard this single,"We all know ""Oochie Wally"" is wack song so I won't bother talking about it. The problem is that no one is commenting on the excellent B-Side ""Find Ya Wealth"". Nas is at his best on this track (when he's rhyming over good beats). Well the production on ""Find Ya Wealth"" is brilliant. The lyrics and flow are stunning and this was my favorite track on the whole QB's Finest Compilation. I recommend you buy the album to get this song instead of the single. There are a few other gems on it. ""Oochie Wally"" is the obvious reason for this single only getting 3 stars from me. On the other hand, best believe that ""Find Ya Wealth"" is a top notch 5 star song from Nasir Jones."
5,You cant go wrong. teehee!,"Its art pencils and its Staedler so you cant go wrong! They are soft, not the softest pencils ever, but definitely the right amount. Ive been using these for about 6 years and I don't plan to ever change that. Get them if you want to make beautiful art!!! Plus they came real early and in perfect shape. It was obvious they were new. :) Thanks Amazon."
4,gumout,seems to have cleaned out some of the deposits and the van is running smoother. since its an '88 guess this will be on my permanent list
1,unhappy,The Blade Guide system cannot be adjusted satisfactorily.The factory was no help. I now have a 400 lb paperweight.The Carter Rep has agreed to help fit a blade guide system so I don't have to throw the whole thing away. Don't waste your money. Buy a machine with real product support.
1,Confusing,"I read this book because I wanted to learn more about the books available to pre-teens and teens. Also, because I expected to learn something about how the genre of problem books came into being. I found Ms. Feinberg's book to be confusing. It was not a discussion of the problem novel. Rather it was one woman's wandering and confusing monologue on her life - current and past - and her vague unease with the books her 12 year old son was reading. It did not provide any true information on the issue, only her subjective view of it. Despite the fact that she is a writer and runs a ""writer's workshop"" for children, she apparently never bothered to confront the school regarding her concerns. Instead, she wrote a book. I gave up half way through."
5,"An engaging, pleasurable read","This book was a pleasure to read -- unlike the many 'problem novels' currently featured on young adult lists. Do kids really need to read such bleak tales of divorce, death, and despair? The engaging text takes us along the author's thought path as she considers these books, talks to her children, and remembers what the books of her childhood meant to her evolving into an adult. Don't be put off by the terrible title -- it's nonfiction, slice-of-life at its best. I'd like to hear more from this author."
5,A Fine example of old Carpathian-Ukrainian Folk Music,I am glad someone took the time out to re record those old 78 records of a great fiddle player and introduce him to us nowadays. If you want to hear turn of the century Csardas-Kolomyika music from the Carpatho-Ukraine style this is it. Fresh and raw just the way it ought to be. When listening to this cd you will be amazed at Pawlo Humeniuk's skill and style which is very intense and detailed.
3,Larger than shown,"I guess the one thing about buying online is that the size of things can be deceiving. I like the look of clean stainless steel and the fact that I will no longer have to pick bristles off my foods. However, I was quite surprised by the size of this brush. It's bigger and heavier than I would have liked. I have other metal utensils, but they don't feel this heavy. I would probably order a wood or plastic handled one if I did this over."
4,Lifetime warranty?????,"Yes, the brush is very useful, easy to use and cleans beautifully. But, as another reviewer mentioned, I too thought MIU France meant it was made in France, not China. There is no information on the tag or product to contact anyone about the warranty. How does Amazon allow this empty promise?"
1,Silly Me,"I don't know why I thought this product was made in France. As it turns out, the ""MIU France Silicone Basting Brush"" is made in ZhongTang, China."
4,Nice brush,"This is a very nice basting brush. It would have received 5 stars if it were longer. The design is very attractive, and it is well made. Great for indoor use."
5,awesome,everything is great about this brush. it works on everything i've tried and doesnt get too hot. it cleans beautifully.great buy!
2,Doesn't Carry Anything,"If you're using this brush to move something around after you've already poured it onto a surface, great. However, if you are trying to use this to brush something onto a surface, bruschetta for example, it takes about four swipes to do what can be done in one swipe with regular brushes. I resorted back to using my paint brush."
2,"Great in theory, terrible in practice","Melted butter and beaten egg whites just won't stick to these silicone bristles (a problem common to all smooth-bristled silicone pastry brushes). You'll have to dip and re-dip the brush over and over, where a traditional ""hair"" brush will pick up enough of your glaze to finish a job quickly."
4,Easy to keep clean.,"I really like this item for its ease of use and the fact that it is so easy to keep clean and is very durable....on the downside, I think that it is just a tad too heavy and the balance seems a bit off....though a guy would probably love it!"
2,Too short handle,The brush is too short for charcoal cooking. It needs to be at least an additional 12 inches longer to be useful. It works fine for indoor cooking. I would have preferred a wooden handle since wood doesn't transmit heat energy as fast as a metal.
2,Poor design,"I purchased this based on the stellar customer reviews, but maybe my hopes were too high for a basting brush. The primary feature I was looking for was something easy to clean. This definitely fit the bill, but I did not foresee the problems I would have the very first time I tried to use it.The first annoying thing is how heavy it is. I thought that I'd be able to brush things using my wrist, like a paintbrush, but it weighs just enough that all the movement has to be in the elbows. Stinky.The more annoying thing is the connection between the black part and the metal part. The silicone was designed (poorly) to be removable and then suction back onto the metal, but it's not a tight fit at all. The silicone part with the bristles will pop off occasionally during use.Now, I just use the silicone part without the handle to brush small items. I'd recommend a different product that is made of silicone but comes in one piece."
3,POTENTIAL NOT PROVEN,"This book HAD enormous potential to be a real thriller - Louisiana, old home, family mystery, slaves/staff, a psychic --- but it falls short of good. The writer puts too much psychobabble, too many personal problems of the empath, too much lovey dovey in the way junk --- it's a shame because this could have been a spellbinder. Buy something else."
3,Good read so far,"But there are a LOT of typos in this Kindle edition, I guess from that ""Captcha"" technology? Very annoying, makes it seem poorly written.It's OK, glad I only paid $1.99."
4,Very frightening mystery!,"This is the first book I've read by Daniel Hecht. It came to me highly recommended and I was not disappointed! What a ride! The main character, Cree Black is a psychologist who specializes in hauntings (a parapsychologist !!). She accepts a job in New Orleans: A woman has returned to live in a childhood home and something dreadful seems to have taken up residence there!Cree is strongly empathetic and finds herself deeply emeshed in the nightmare haunting that follows. Wow! This book has everything! Dark family secrets, hideous ghosts, hoodoo -- you name it! Every horror story, and mystery story, cliche makes an appearance! But they work! Not only is it truly terrifying, but the mystery itself wasn't simplistic, and was one I certainly didn't see coming!I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys suspense and mystery in a good thriller!"
5,read this before land of echoes,"super interesting. a bit of new orleans mystery - a good read or listen if you like ghosts - paranormal stories. Cree and her associates are wonderful, Joyce and Edgar - and her new interest Paul!"
1,Not one redeeming quality in this crushing bore of a read,"This book is populated by self-absorbed, ridiculous, and unbelievable characters. Not one among them shows anything remotely admirable. There is no turn of phrase that makes your heart quicken here, just a stupid, silly plot that drags on forever. There is no human insight, no rewarding or uplifting moral message. I honestly do not know how such nonsense was ever accepted for publication."
2,Typos Really Destroy Enjoyment,"I bought this book for the Kindle as a ""daily deal"" and I am so glad I didn't pay full price for this one. I lived in New Orleans and so I was curious to see if any original thought or use of background/cultures was going to be used to create the story's plot development - sadly there wasn't anything new to the treatment. The typos were incredibly annoying to the point I had no way of knowing what the author/character was trying to say! Hard for me to work up an empathetic response to Cree. If you enjoy this genre, I think Terri Reid is a better bet for the money."
4,City of Masks,"Interesting, keeps you guessing from beginning to end. Every time that I thought I had it figured out it took another turn. Very well written and insightful. I enjoyed this read very much. Hard to put down, and fun to try to figure out. Read this book you won't be sorry."
1,Read Between the Typos,"This book became so annoying to read on my Kindle. There was at least 1 typo/misspelled word on every page! Also, the author felt free to invent his own words as he went along. Doesn't anyone proofread these things? In addition,the main character is very pathetic. What kind of a psychoanalyst can't have enough sense to seek help for her own emotional instability?"
2,interesting premise...disappoints,"I really started out liking this story. Loved the New Orleans setting and the idea of ghost hunting combined with a possible hoodoo/voodoo connection. But the character of Cree Black got on my nerves so bad that I found myself not caring much about her one way or the other. She is supposed to be a 'brilliant' Ph.D in psychology, but she's an emotional train wreck who can hardly navigate her way through life. Why anyone would pay her thousands to exorcise their ghosts is beyond me. She's ineffectual, totally incapable of intimacy, lies compulsively to her friends and family, and seems stuck in this self-pity time warp over her husband who died 9 years ago! Please!"
4,great story but needs a good editor,"This a wonderful introduction to the city, culture, and mardi gras season in New Orleans. The nuances of a ""the city that care forgot"" are well explained and I believe it is a must read for anyone traveling to New Orleans for the first time. I enjoyed the guidebook nature of the story as well as the plotlines. However, on the kindle version, there were 47 mispelled words and several problems with verb tenses, pagination, dashes in strange places, and repeatable font changes within a page, word and/or chapter. I am not sure if the lack of editing extends to the paperback and hardcover versions. For a 1.99 it was a compelling read and painless experience in learning about New Orleans."
4,City of Masks - Kindle version,"I found the story well crafted and the premise and characters interesting and believable. I found the quality of the Kindle version awful! The typos were numerous and distracting. It was clear no one even took the time to do spell check, there are numbers, slashes and hyphens in bizarre and frequent places. The text appears to be scanned so that shape of the word is similar but it makes no sense. I got this as a deal of the day, but at any price the copy should have been better editted."
5,An excellent read!!,"Daniel Hecht has certainly done his homework with this wonderfully written book. He describes the city of New Orleans very accurately, and all of the characters fit into the backdrop seamlessly. I certainly look forward to reading the next novel in the Cree Black series. She is a very likeable character with a fascinating gift. I can't wait to see where Cree will end up next, perhaps with Dr. Paul Fitzpatrick by her side? Don't keep us waiting too long Mr. Hecht!!"
3,Engaging story if you can get past the plethora of typos,"I found the story quite engaging, however, I have to wonder if a proofreader even glanced at the Kindle edition before publishing. I found the abundant number of typos to be very distracting. I'm interested in reading more titles in this series, but I have to wonder if I'll encounter the same lack of proofreading."
3,Terrible Typos,"This book looked promising. A psychological/paranormal mystery set in New Orleans was just irrestible. However, the typos are so pervasive that it's difficult for the reader to stay focussed on the plot and characters. Some of the errors actually forced me to guess what the author intended to say. The author should be indignant and demand a retype of this kindle book."
3,Hung Up in Harlequin Angst,"This is, I suspect, an attempt to emulate Mary Higgins Clark -an unsuccessful attempt. My advice: Stay with The Real Thing.On Mother's Day, 13 year old Jenny Newhall's biological mother appears unannounced to daughter and adoptive parents. The Mother & Child Reunion is short-lived, though, as Mother Linda is soon found dead in a dumpster. Adoptive parents Karen and Greg come under suspicion. The suspense and thrills are diluted with several subplots of ""Can These Marriages Be Saved?"" Jenny runs a close 2d to Diane Mott Davidson's Arch as Bratty Fictional Kid Who Readers Couldn't Care Less About. This book could become a Lifetime TV Network movie - I vote for ""Judging Amy""s Jessica Tuck (Jillian) to play Glenda Emery. Reviewed by TundraVision, Amazon Reviewer."
2,"Not as good as ""The Unforgiven""","Don't waste your time with this one, read Patricia J. MacDonald's master piece ""The Unforgiven"" instead.It is very compelling and has lots of New England island atmosphere plus an unpredictable ending. Very recommendable!!!"
4,One of the best TMBG albums,"I like this album. I think it is one of the best albums They Might Be Giants have released. My favourite is ""Man, It's Loud In Here"", but I also like ""Another First Kiss"" and ""Cyclops Rock"". Some of the lyrics are hilarious and I think that this is another great album for all They Might Be Giants fans."
4,Plenty of good stuff here,"After giving this CD a good 15 to 20 listenings, I'm happy to say that it's perfectly listenable and as good as any other TMBG effort. Though the lyrics are not as zany as some previous CD's, their musical composition is quite impressive here. There are songs here that just plain rock, such as ""Bangs."" There are songs that are aesthetically quite pretty, such as ""Hovering Sombrero."" There are songs that are quite funny, such as ""Wicked Little Critta,"" which refers to a kid riding around on his sissy bar laden bike, popping wheelies and laying a patch on the tar. Something that will bring back memories if you grew up during the 70's. By the way, the title track ""Mink Car"" is the most bizarre, [...]tripping tune here. If you can make sense of it, let me know!"
4,Sprightly and Gratifying,"They Might Be Giants' ninth release, Mink Car, is one of their sprightliest and most immediately gratifying. The Johns' Flansburgh and Linnell have never incorporated full rock band sound to such glorious effect before - from the opening pop stomp of ""Bang"" and the metal parody ""Cyclops Rock"" to the Eurotrash disco of ""Man, It's So Loud in Here"" and the secret agent guitar of ""She Thinks She's Edith Head"". Their sense of absurdity remains intact: ""Man, It's So Loud in Here"" explores the architectural kitsch of endless discos, ""Older"" is a real time exploration of aging, and ""Mink Car"" is a Bacharach/David pastiche of that titular ride. Fun stuff, rockier than usual."
4,more like 3.5...,"...and one whole star in that rating is due solely to ""man it's so loud in here""...brilliant dance song.and then there's the delightfully, sickeningly sappy ""another first kiss"", which my wife and i used in our wedding.but there are a lot of duds here--ahem, ""mr. excitement"", ahem--it's split about 50/50 between brilliant pop songs and total throwaways, so yes, it's weaker than it should've been."
4,Yea-yeah,"the new TMBG does not dissappoint.But follow instructions, take back your pinata and drink, drink!"
3,I hate to do this so much,"This is my least favorite TMBG album, why:1.This album uses rap2.few songs I listen to3.TMBG completly choose the wrong internet songs.It should've had Lullaby to nightmares,Maybe I know, On the drag, rat patrol,rest awhile and Certain People I could name(not that the last 4 matter since I own They got lost)This album reminds me nothing of TMBG. The only songs that can become Classics are Bangs, Hovering Sombrero, Man, Its so load in here,Older, and maybe Cyclops Rock and My man"
5,How could you not love this CD?,"TMBG are great, and I was looking forward to this, their first release since I saw them *LIVE* in San Francisco (a high point of my life- us left coasters don't get to see the Johns enough). How much did I like it? Well, I bought it the day it came out, misplaced the CD about a week ago, and missed it so much I bought a second copy today...can't live without is any longer! My faves: Bangs, Wicked Little Critta, I've got a Fang, Cyclops Rock. I agree with a previous review that Older is a little boring upon repeated listening, but I heard that one live, so it still makes me smile :-)"
4,A great album of hilarious & powerful genre shape shifting,"I've long been a fan of the brothers John, and I would argue that this album is essential TMBG. I'm really impressed with how accurately the band rips through such diverse sounds and styles while maintaining a distinct Giants feel throughout.TMBG has always done great, iconoclastic music. This album, to me, represents the attainment of a real goal for them: Successfully marrying the ""full band"" sound they've been targeting since John Henry, with the signature TMBG textures some have felt absent since Apollo 18 era Giants.Note to big fans: Several tracks (older, Edith Head, etc) have been concert/live staples for some time, and will be familiar!The Burt Bacharach horns in the title track RULE, as do the dead-on Erasure-esque bass/drum fills.Get it. You'll like it."
4,Stands with their strongest efforts,"It's a bit surprising to hear the Johns dropping block-rockin' beats, but the CD works well. It has all the wit one expects from the boys, but the ""full band"" sound feels more integrated here than it did on ""Factory Showroom"" and at times shows off an uncanny warmth. The songs benefit from the producers' input -- props to Adam Schlesinger for the hypnotic drum machines on ""Man, It's So Loud In Here"" and the surprisingly tender remix of ""Another First Kiss"" -- and Flansburgh and Linnell sound energetic and enthusiastic throughout. Wanna know why the Johns have been called one of the best songwriting teams around? Pick up this CD."
2,A step back for TMBG,"I eagerly awaited this disc and was disappointed upon listening to it. For reference, let me state that my favorite TMBG albums are John Henry and Factory Showroom. I really like the full band sound and when the electric guitars are prominent. This album seems like a throwback to Lincoln and the first album to me, with many catchy and weird tunes but no cohesion. Many songs seem experimental little bits that were extended into song length, not fully realized pop songs. This album just doesn't flow. Supposedly the Band of Dans are all over this album, but it is hard to tell. Mr. Xcitement and Wicked Little Critta are 2 of the worst things TMBG have ever put to album and sound like bad B-sides. That said, I do like It's So Loud In Here, Another First Kiss, and Mink Car alot. Bangs is OK also. The rest do nothing for me"
4,It's bright!,"It's very bright. In my climate it lasts until 2 in the morning. (Although I have yet to see how long it will be doing that.)But there are no instructions. So it sat in the garden without lighting up for two days. There is no on-off switch as on some other solar lights. On the third day, I discovered the little plastic pull-out that prevents the batteries from making contact during shipping. Pull that thing out, and, yessir, there is light at night.Instructions would be good, however."
5,Almost Great,"I find the music right on, but there is one thing missing. The words. I now have to copy the words from the original recordings, in order to sing with this cd, otherwise it is a great karaoke cd. I received this cd days before the predicted arrival at my home, so the service was exceptional."
5,Eastern Jazz,"At last, an album of spiritualized jazz-inflected music from a superb ensemble! The oud is displayed here in all its versatility, and in Abou-Khalil's artful hands."
1,hi,This was not what I expected to be. I wouldn't recommend anyone to buy this product again. I don't know what to write.
2,"Interesting story, poor writing","This book could have been much better if it progressed in a linear fashion. Much time is spent talking about small time players and the industry in general, but Worldcom and Bernie Ebbers seem to be on the backburner. The scandal is not brought up until the last 15 pages of the book, with only vague reference to ""cooking the books"" and writing off capital expenses.It's an easy, quick read that is mildly entertaining. Unfortunately, it falls short in the facts and research department."
3,In the Middle of Nowhere,"The book is presenting facts in a not too organised way. The most interesting facts are already presented at the beginning so that the following 150 pages just give more details.It might have been better to focus more on the problem/case itself instead of describing early history in every detail.Weakest point of ""Disconnected"" is that the book ends in the middle of the ongoing story and the reader does not know what was the outcome of this scandal."
2,Fluff,"I found this book to be very basic and lacking details of the actual events that brought this company down. One minute you are reading about the genral morale of the office then all of a sudden there is a reference to ""cooking the books"" or something to the effect that this company is going to fall like a deck of cards. No where do you get the details of the actions that actually took place.If I wanted fluff I could have just watched some TV news stories on the company."
4,A nice little collection of big holiday hits,"You can't go wrong with this collection-especially at the price Amazon is offering for it. True, side 1 has the usual fare by Bobby Helms, Brenda Lee, Chuck Berry,et al, but side 2 is not to be overlooked. You'll find some major Motown Christmas tunes like Christmas Everyday by Smokey & the Miracles, Stevie Wonder's Someday At Christmas, The Jackson 5's version of Santa Claus Is Coming To Town & The Temptations singing Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer. The real piece de resistance is Amen as sung by The Impressions. Highly recommended."
3,Very pale yellow....,"I dont want to say this. But it is not a bright yellow as shown. It's a very pale yellow. But for the colour, its OK."
3,Not Potok's Best,I have read all of the books written by Chaim Potok. I love the depth of his charactors. This was my least favorite of his books. It was not a memorable read. In fact I can hardly remember what it was about.
3,Attempt at a history lesson...,"When I purchased this book at my local bookstore, I was exhilerated with finally finding a new book written by one of my favorite authors.I enjoyed the first novella entitled The Ark Builder a great deal because I was able to emotionally connect with the characters and ultimately wanted to befriend them.I am now in the middle of the second novella entitled The War Doctor. It reads like a history text, and my thoughts are beginning to wander and I'm getting disinterested. I'm contemplating giving up and not finishing the book."
2,Have a true look at the Stalin era,Loved the middle short story. It does transport you back to the Stalin era. What a horrible era.
2,Very unrealistic,"Seventh grade child falls in love and for 15 years waits for the high school boy of her dreams while he leaves town, marries and has a son....that whole story line didn't work for me at all. I tried reading this book twice and neither time could I get father than the first few chapters because it was just too unrealistic! Maybe I've known too many 4 year olds, but I've never known one that would act and talk like the one in this story. So maybe finishing the book is key, but not for me."
3,Eh...it's ok I guess.,"Very solid, doesn't look as polished and luxurious as it does in the photo. You can tell it actually cost $30.00Can't complain though because it does keep time as promised."
3,No Stress David Fortney 3 DVD set.,"The first dvd, Desert Light is beautiful, definitely up to David Fortney standards. The second, Earth Flight, is also beautiful--if you don't already have ""Timeless"", the source of a large part of this dvd. The third DVD, Reflections, has some good scenery, but is ruined by an entirely different style--closeups of plants, etc., and any beginner can do as well. Wish I had known that a very large portion is a reprint of other work, with some poor quality to fill out the Reflections dvd.But: David Fortney is an outstanding creator of this type video, only the last approximately half of the Reflections video leaves a negative impression of Fortney."
1,Fraud!,"The author is a fraud, she is stealing your money so she can get rich off you! Don't buy the book!"
3,The author's response nearly as pathological as the stalker!,"As a therapist, it is one thing to encounter a pathological person. It is something else again, to respond in a pathological fashion. I could not help feeling that the author's overreaction to all that she experienced, could not have helped the situation. As therapists, we are at risk. Less than some professions, far more than others. Her fear and reactions were consistantly unwarrented. I would have like to have seen her get help with her own reactions to a difficult situation!"
2,It looked like a good idea......,"But once I bought it and started using the recipies I was dissapointed. The pictures all look great, but I'm afraid that's where the greatness ends. There are a few good recipies in here, but the decent recipies were things I already could do with hamburger. I bought it for the 'innovative' and 'new' recipies, hoping that I could use hamburger for more creative meals since we're on a grocery budget. Every recipie I tried came out mushy and bland, even following the directions carefully.If your only method of cooking with hamburger currently is with hamburger helper, this book may be of help to you. But, if you already cook fairly frugally, and can make some decent hamburgers, chilis, spagetti sauces, a caserole or two and tacos/burritos with hamburger you probably will not be able to put this book to use."
3,cheap quality,We did not like the fan appearance at all and sent them back. They looked like cheap quality. Waste of our money on return shipping. Leaves on the blades. And crystal pulls on the strings.
1,quality and performance for ceiling fans,"I just bought 2 of these fans for my outdoor, covered porch. Both fans work, but they are noisy . Sitting directly under them I can't feel the air at all even with the control set on high. I tried the blades both ways (drawing the air upward and downward) Hight speed performs like ""medium to low"" speed on most other fans. I bought these to keep cool and to keep the mosquitos away. They won't do either. You get what you pay for."
2,ceiling fan,We were very disapointed in this ceiling fan. The fans were very thin and of poor quality. This is a case where you get what you pay for. Did not look any where near as good as the photo. Would not recommend this product.
3,Klezmer mucsic cd - condition of disc,"The disc is damaged at the very last song. I have to remove the cd from my player before the last song as I am afraid it will damage the cd player. I can't physically spot the damage but there is obviously something wrong. The song starts out alright but it jumps, skips, pauses and spins ahead. The rest of the disc is OK.Also, the cover had a big crack on it as if something heavy was dropped on it. The packaging it came in had almost no padding. A cheap padded envelope used for documents, etc. not media.It's a pity because I enjoy the cd otherwise."
3,"Fine, but could have been 50% shorter.","When I finished reading this book I realized there wasn't much to learn about CGI. In fact, the first thing I did with my computer after reading was learning Perl with the accompanying HTML documents.You will also be able to learn Perl with the examples in the book, but some of them are not too useful.Anyway, I had to buy it to realize about these facts (or, at least, what I think are facts), so I am not disappointed at all.PS: The book tries to teach you a lot of things you will probably not be interested in."
4,"A good book, but not enough actual source code.","I was very happy to find the extra book mounted on the CD, Perl 5 in 21 days, but the actual book itself would describe general concepts without actually giving enough concrete examples of how to do it. This book is definitely intended for those who are already fairly experienced with programming in Perl. Also, the author could stand to be a little less dry and his code should be more readable (indentation and white space)."
1,cgi unleashed,"I can sum it up in one word, [stinks]The first 1/3 of the book is informationyou should already know before you buy this book."
4,the lullabye of the bells is sooo peaceful!,"i didn't buy this cd yet but i just wanted to say for buyers to watch the two movies firs to see if you liked them. it looks like a pretty shabby cd with four songs and all, but it's the only cd of the soundtrack that i know. i'll probably buy it soon anyway. my advice by this cd if you like opera. if you don't, your screwed. i gave this 4 stars instead of five because there aren't many tracks as you can see."
1,Just Plain odd,"I was looking forward to this but was pretty diappointed... the characters are not very gripping, it doesn't follow any one person very closely such that you feel its about them and when the season ends it feels like there is no conclusions. I will be selling it :/ wasn't at all what I thought in terms of Camera perspective either. its more about other people watch folks in camera rather than you watching them. On the whole it left me unsatisfied."
4,Mission is the expansion of communion,"A friend of mine recommended that I read this book after I told him about my disappointment in a mission trip my parish organized. He quoted this line: ""Community is not a group of persons who get together in order to accomplish something; communion is an essential dimension of the `I'. Hence, there is a fundamental priority of staying over leaving, an awareness that mission is not and cannot be the solitary and solipsistic song of a generous heart. Mission is the expansion of the communion that we live together."" When I read that, I finally understood what was missing in our missionary project and why it left me feeling alone and powerless in front of the suffering of other people. Fr. Camisasca, proposes that mission must be the expression of community. I wish he had been leading our mission!"
4,For intermediate students and above,"This book is rich in detail about playing positions, tone reproduction, and practice techniques. But while there are some pictures showing posture, fingering, etc. in Appendix A, it would be difficult for a student who has never studied music theory or played the violin to truly grasp the concepts.For intermediate or advanced students, however, this book will reinforce the instructions of teacher-led study and help the student enhance their playing skills.If you are an adult just starting out with violin play, I suggest you instead pick up The ABCs of Violin for the Absolute Beginner."
4,Great book,"I limited myself to 4 stars because I'm not an expert on violin materials, but I loved this book. When I found this book I was looking for a well written, comprehensive book that covers all of the basic aspects of violin playing. This book does a wonderful job of it. A lot of nuanced aspects of playing are addressed and explained very well.I hope there are more, possibly better books out there (as this book cannot cover everything there is to learn), but this is the best I've found so far."
5,Comprehensive Resource,"The style of writing and the photos are antiquated but the information is timeless and comprehensive. It's not for the meek, rather, it's for the serious student and those wishing to advance to a higher level. The book illustrates and describes the basic mechanics and essential skills needed for violin playing, the rational behind the technique, and how it all fits together. The book is an amazing resource. Expensive, but worth it."
4,review,"Not 5 stars only because the the book is an older version of the one in the picture. It has the same content, however."
1,Just got this,"Just got this book so I can't rate the contents - It is packaged really nicely, but should have been spiral bound - or a hardback. The spine will break. I suppose this ought not to matter to a real cook, but it bothers me a little."
1,Disappointing,"While I am a great fan of Marion Cunningham, this is a disappointing book. First, the book is not actually a hardback, but rather it is a paperback which has been inserted into a cardboard outer binding. It will not last. More disappointing are the recipes - many of them I have seen in other volumes of Mrs Cunningham's. One would do much better buying her most-exellent Fannie Farmer Cookbook and get a monster book of well tried and proven recipes. The graphics in this book are perfectly lovely, but I would heartily recommend that the potential purchaser consider one of Mrs Cunningham's many other cookbooks."
5,Just lovely,"What a lovely book and wonderful collection of recipes. This reminds me of all the things I have been meaning to cook for my family - but updated recipies to make it easier and healthier than my Mom's versions.Try the beef stroganoff - a real winner!Note to review with the binding problem - use a cook book holder - keeps special books like this clean and it will solve your problem. Personally, I think the book is a beautiful presentation and I have already tucked a few clippings into the recipe pocket."
4,My experience with Hawthorn.,"I have high blood pressure.I don't care about scientific explanations, or marketing BS.I just know this: after eating 2 capsules 2-3 times per day for 2 months - my blood pressure went down, from 145 to 132.Sometimes, when I take 4 instead of two - I start sleeping infront of TV, 5-6PM.Never happened before. It means berries work for me somehow."
3,Chris Kielkopf views of Internet danger,"As captivating and useful as the Internet and the social media world are for people today, The Dangers of the Internet and the potential problems that can arise from it need to be promoted. This author through his understanding of family life and at risk populations, presents a thoughtful introduction to the topic of risks and the Internet. The reader is a able to learn about internet risks and find subject areas to study further as well as learn helpful tips and information to increase personal awareness and self protection."
5,Scary good lens,"I take a lot of high school soccer photos. Light is bad and the action fast. I think this lens is perfect. It is heavy and powerful. It gets the job done. There is almost no distortion and the it puts me on the field with action. It is not easy to use, a tripod is necessary, although if you have good upper body strength a monopod works. Nothing is like it."
5,"Great lens, great price @ Amazon.","This is my 2nd SHQ Zukio lens (also have 35-100mm f2); lens is attached to my E-5 most of the time, occassionally on my E-30. Great lens for birding, plan to use lens for cross country track at local high school. Picture quality is most impressive on both my cameras with this lens and with the EC-14 teleconverter; nice bokeh to. Quite heavy, close to 10 lbs on E-5 but I have managed to take great photos with handheld shooting. I had this lens in my cart for many months waiting for the price to come down to an affordable price (it was still expensive)...and, Christmas Day Amazon had a special price that didn't last long, new @ $4824.88!! and that included free shipping! Amazon's free super saver shipping was also great on this purchase, ordered the 25th of December and had it on the 28th."
4,Wonderful and it's Italian,"Bertolucci has done a wonderful job of telling a story visually and combining music with it in a way that is compelling and unique. The cimematography and editing is top notch and use of color just what one would want to find in a good film. It is rather ""Italian"" in how the story is realized and that can be both a good and a bad thing, depending upon one's taste. I do wish the lovely Thandie Newton had practiced throwing up in a mirror first or that Mr. Bertolucci had simply re-thought that part.Still, this is a remarkable movie and well worth having in my collection."
1,Beseiged. . .beware. . .belittling,"Dangerous; racist.Beneath--just barely beneath--this seemingly tender, this apparently noble story is the wretched, often repeated tale of a white master's sexual conquest of his black negress servant.Racist; dangerous."
1,Not what I thought.,"The description on the package was more informative than the movie itself. The movie was lacking in storyline, dialogue and quality of film. The slowness of the movie made me fast forwarded through much of it, without even given a seccond thought to what I was skipping."
5,Beautiful,This is such a romantic movie in a very unconventional sense. I love it and can watch it over and over. It's fascinating inspite of the fact that there isn't much dialogue. Beautiful film.
5,"A collection of humor, pathos and biting wit","Sly wit and biting observations on contemporary womanhood couched in the context of Sei Shonagon's Pillow Book and ancient Chinese and Japanese poets. I loved these poems, the adventurous avenues, the casual everyday activities juxtaposed with the startling image and wrenching confessions."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BELT,"AFTER ONLY THREE MONTHS THE BELT IS RIPPING WHERE IT GETS BUCKLED TO THE LEATHER. IN ADDITION TO THAT THE BUCKEL ITSELF IS ABOUT TO FALL OFF. I HAVE OWNED LEATHER BELTS THAT HAVE LASTED FOR YEARS AND YEARS. THIS BELT IS PURE JUNK. DO NOT PURCHASE IT,,,,,,,,,,"
1,so bad,"disappointed, the appearance of the brown side is good, with good color and leather details, the black side is a deception because it is the lining of the belt, is not leather, not at all nice, buckle belt is reversible but it is not, should assert much less"
4,Too Stiff but nice,The belt is of nice qualify but a bit too stiff for my liking. I'm sure it will soften with time though.
4,Sturdy Belt,"Belt is sturdier than those I have bought at tome retail stores. It is too early to tell how long it will last. It does look nice, though.Update: It only lasted for about 6 months. I am now changing my review score to 1 star."
1,buckle broke off,The buckle broke right off after only a few wearings. My husband had to hold his pants up by hand for the rest of the day. Do not buy it!
2,Belt doesn't hold up,This belt must be made from something other than leather. It just doesn't hold up and will crack up at the holes. I have bought several of them and I think I need to move on to something better.
2,too hard,"not that good, a little disappoint about the belt. and there is no Lee's logo on it. i hope there won't be any problem after using it in the future"
1,Cheap Belt,I bought this in November and the buckle broke off the belt in February. Not a very good value.
2,"Nice belt, didn't last","I'd worn the belt for only two weeks when the buckle irreparably separated from the leather. Don't know whether it was faulty design or shoddy material. But for the first 13 days, the belt was just fine.Note that some Amazon documentation says this belt is 1 3/8"". It really is 1 1/8""."
2,Nice for the price but won't last...,"Split at the holes after less than one year of regular use. Nice looking reversible belt, but rather stiff. If the material was not so stiff, it might not split so easily."
1,Buyer Beware,The buckle came off in less than two weeks. It was very poor quality and I was very disappointed for a belt over $20 with shipping. If you're smart you will shop elsewhere.
1,Not what the description says cheater,I am damn angry to see this belt. There is no sign that its from Lee.Also the measurement 36 inch is wrong it is 35 inch. Seller added one inch for buckle. Be careful guys!! buyer beware. It took so long to come. Very bad experience with seller and Amazon as whole.
1,Doesn't Hold Up!,"I bought this belt a year ago. I've worn it 20-30 times in the last year. It doesn't hold up. The leather is brittle, and the area around the buckle hole that I use has cracked badly, all the way to the edge of the belt.I'm not knowledgeable about leather curing & tanning, but its obvious that the manufacturer skipped or rushed a step in the process. The leather isn't holding up like it should. I've got belts that are five years old, and they look WAY better than this one does.I would not recommend this belt to anyone."
1,Please DO NOT bye this item,"This broke almost at once when i first got it, it came undone between the belt buckel it has a place which is VERY week and any strain will snap it i HATE i went to walmart much better stuff in ref. to this."
2,Mens Belt,"The belt was listed as 1 3/8"" and in fact was only 1 1/8"". Either the wrong belt was sent or it is not as advertised."
2,Just Ok.,"Bought it in Jan for my husband. Not daily use. Probably 2-3 days a week.It started to wear out on the belt holes in June. Last month it finally broke into two , only held by padding material.It's a nice looking belt, but won't last...Btw, it came only with a plastic wrap... No logo or any fancy tags...Don't consider it as a gift."
3,Attractive but stiff as iron,"Good looking belt and buckle, but very stiff. I Vaselined it, as you might do with a new baseball glove and that has helped a little. Worn it a dozen times. Maybe it will mellow with age and use. If it weren't so stiff the rating would be five stars."
1,Great Belt ... But Doesn't Hold Up,"I really like this belt, but I guess it's too stiff. Like other reviews,I have to agree that it doesn't hold up. I've had mine for about 6 months. Mine is about ready to break in half in two or three places. If it wasn't so stiff this probably wouldn't happen. To bad, since it works well for Jeans as Brown, or dress as Black."
4,Heavy Duty Belt,Heavy duty and will need a good break in period before it is comfortable. I hope the reversing hinge is as durable as the belt appears to be.
4,I Loved It !!!,"I picked it out of my library at random and was pretty much blown away. very beautiful writing, completely different and interesting subject. A wonderful book that should be read by lots of people. i've never really read a book like it. i loved the writing."
2,"Very similiar to ""The Arm and the Darkness"".","Again book was very similiar to ""The Arm and the Darkness"". Pages coming loose, very worn, yellow, etc. Haven't read this book yet either-just do not like the smell, etc."
3,Okay book,"I have always loved Taylor Caldwell's novels and love the subject of Atlantis, but this book wasn't her best. They say she wrote it when she was thirteen years old! It was an okay book."
2,"waste of money, sorry","This book is a waste of money. Some of the exercises are the direct way to injury (e.g. full squat and leg press ""lowering the resistance as far as possible"" good-bye sweet meniscus!!). The exercises are ok, but how on earth can somebody introduce them without explaining the risks and safety instructions!?! Same with stretching in hyperlordosis....!The author comes from basketball and didn't even take the time to redesign the sketches of the court drills. ...not very professional.The general introductions into the different topics are mainly ok.I recommend ""Complete Conditioning for Volleyball"" and ""The Volleyball Coacing Bible""; that is helpful and professional sport literature."
4,Artist,This is a hot underground album. More people need to check thesepeople out because these cats is off the meat rack! One....
5,Part 2 of a masterpiece,I reviewed part 3 as well and pointed out that there are a lot of old fashioned French terms in here that I didn't know. I not only learned some new vocabulary I also ended up learning about French history as well. I am glad I read these in French even though it was quite a challenge compared to picking up an English copy.
2,Lost interest,"While I'm not a hardcore connoisseur of anime, I have seen enough to recognize that the art was just okay and the animation not much better than what you see on the tube on Saturday mornings. Lots of the action wasn't action but rather still images. If I want to look at pictures I'd get a comic.I quickly didn't care for the characters and I found the music annoying. In short, there wasn't much draw to watch.I'd guess if you were an anime fan that this one would move to the back of your shelf and soon be forgotten."
2,Not the best anime,"While Black Blood Brothers tries to throw overblown action in the form of high-flying vampires spraying bullets at their enemies, the story is really lacking. The characters are flat and not compelling enough to draw the viewer in and the animation offers nothing that cannot be found in other anime series. I've tried to like it, as I enjoy quite a lot of anime, but I simply could not find anything worth recommending in this one. I have not obtained the succeeding chapters and will not do so."
3,"Not Bad, but no Ninja Scroll","Black Blood Brothers is a series with decent animation, but frankly an uninspiring story That just didn't hold me. I must admit that I had a difficult time finishing all the episodes."
2,Not in the level of Hellsing or Trinity Blood,"I must admit I haven't heard of Black Blood Brothers, despite having the whole Hellsing and Trinity Blood collection, until it appeared on my Amazon Vine mail. It's a little more juvenile than the aforementioned two despite stylized violence. Also, the characters are not quite as interesting and comes off as a little shallow. It may be argued that character development do take several episodes but from the first few episodes, the introduction didn't pique my curiosity to make me want to get the succeeding collections.Another thing, all of my above comments would've been made irrelevant if the animation was in the league of Ghost In The Shell or Naruto. But it's quite stilted and ordinary similar to those disposable anime/toy tie ins. Better wait for this on your cable channel, if it does make it."
2,kinda boring,"This is a very average anime movie. The animation is average, the storyline is average (and borderline boring), and the characters have average interest to them. The movie would be a good interests to anime fans that like vampires but to those that could care less about them, this is a boring movie."
5,awsome vampire anime,In my opinion this is the first good vampire anime in a while. Black Blood Brothers adds some interesting new twists to the vampire genre such as vampires and humans fighting along side each other during the war against the koolon Children and the fact that getting bit by a vampire is a intensly plesurable experiance. I really like the interesting angle this series takes toward vampires and I would highly recomend it.
2,"Pitched to kids, lacks poetic license explicitness","This is another anime that has a good concept and material but surrenders its promise to the constraints of self-censorship to qualify as a kids movie. The idea of having a mutant race of child vampires disrupting the current order of things is a promising one, which could even be taken in some sexually explicit interesting directions, yet because of the producers' inhibitions and maybe also because of societal taboos, legal and otherwise, we the viewers lose out with a bland version of what might have been. This is a good example of why censorship is so insidious and destructive. Let parents decide what their children can watch, but allow a free market in expression so the more seasoned art connoisseurs can enjoy true art that is beautiful, ground-breaking and innovative, not rendered impotent and sterile for a narrow audience."
3,"Good quality, fun anime","I really wanted to give this 3.5 stars. This is a good quality (both image and sound) DVD anime collection. I did have to clean the disk when I first put it in due to skipping however. I am new to this series and almost gave up after the first episode, which made almost no sense to me and did not have much in the way of plot (I believe it was suppose to be the back story given in the original series). However, the second episode was very entertaining and the story really started to pick up. It is a fun series. The DVD does not have much in the way of extras, I could get the original japanese track and subtitles for the first episode, but after that I had no luck and ended up watching the english dub. The english dub is of better quality then most so this was not too bad. There just is not that much in the way of dvd extras, which I always find sad. Not a bad set however and people how already love Black Blood Brothers and who are not starting would most likely love this."
1,grease,"Don't ever buy from this supplier. Product works well, but even when I paid for expidited shipping it still took over a week to get this product. Find it somewhere else."
4,Another point of view,"I have and old old copy of this book MARY, I wanted to replace it because it was a book I was reading to my Mother as she was dying. It also give an insight on what life was about in the time of Jesus and Mary. Mary was 16 yr old when ahe answered God's call. What an awesome responsibility she took on. Would we in this day and age accept without question God's call??"
4,Great early1990s indy film with familiar faces!,"I purchased this film in the early 1990s on vhs and was astonished how good it was. Peter Greene, late of playing ""Zed"" in ""Pulp Fiction"" plays the best friend of character actor Adam Trese (a familiar face on the original ""Law and Order"")who is heading for trouble by carrying a concealed gun in a ""weapons free"" mob-run area of Brooklyn, New York.The film follows their quick descent as they compound their troubles with horrendous decisions and fatal consequences.The film is also the source of the phrase ""mucka ferguson"", itself a euphemism for a certain swear-word combo, popularised by the eponymous band that adopted it for their own.It has taken a VERY long time to see this on dvd when other garbage films have seen release on dvd for a decade. Though very pricey at over $20.00, if it gets below $15.00 a must purchase for fans of early 1990s dramatic realism."
4,If you are interested in Polish culture,"So i promise you that the music is original... it is also very old. Unfortunately, that means that it will not be the quality that we expect our CDs to be in. If you are Polish and I am, you can recognize the words... although you might notice that they are in different accents. Just because we learn the same language at school doesn't mean that what lies in roots of the nation is as unified. Those people that were recorded for this CD are barely musicians... they are mostly old... can't really sing but do remember the words of crazy old songs. Those people played and sang their whole life not for your recognition but for their own enjoyment to ease the hardships of whatever they were doing. I think that it is a good picture of what south Poland was long time ago when it came to celebrating weddings, baby showers and other things."
5,Great book about Brazil,"This was the second book that I have read in The Travellers Tales series. I enjoyed the Mexican book, but the Brazilian book was unbelievable. I read the book over a summer and it was like being on a two month trip throughout the country. The nice feature about this series is the short stories each of which take you to a different place or situation. Then if you want to continue reading on that topic, you can use the bibliography, and get the book from where the story was excerpted. I can't say enough about how much I enjoyed reading the Brazilian book. The only problem with the book was having to finish reading it because I didn't want to put it down. Looking forward to travelling to the country for business or pleasure in the near future. Hot, hot, hot..."
3,This book is overrated.,"Having read rave reviews, I purchased Travelers' Tales Brazil. While some of the stories are interesting, the whole book smacks of dilettantism, that is, the stories are written by rich kids who got to spend some time there and want us to know about it. I don't think having lots of short stories by lots of different dilettantes, sort of a shotgun approach, adds anything. An in-depth book by an individual, sympathetic observer would be much better. Probably a good novel of Brazil would also be much better. Travelers' Tales didn't do much for me"
5,I loved it and think Chesser is a cheesehead,I thought that the book was a balanced collection of wonderful and telling tales of life in Brazil; well rounded and very well put together. I strongly recommend it.
2,Not Up-to-Date,"I purchased this book in 1989 and used it then, and again, later in 1994. I now live on the Big Island and can tell you that this book is not up-to-date on the easily accessible beaches. There have been marked changes in the 4WD beaches, also. What was once my Beach Bible, is no longer useful. It WAS a great book."
1,Beaches of the Big Island,"This book displays black and white pictures and is totally outdated. Out of all the tour books on Hawaii that I ordered (Frommers 2000, Fodors 2000, Best Places to Stay in Hawaii and the guides books written by Andrew Doughty and Harriet Friedman, Lonely Planet) this was by far the worst. I should have returned it while I could but I wanted to give it a chance. What a waste of time and money."
5,Great Resource,"Great resource for people seeking off the beaten path beach experiences. Book predates destruction of Kalapana by the volcano so there is some out of date information but everything else is right on target. Helped us find long sought ""Nanawale Dunes"" and they did not disappoint. Highly recommend."
1,Asked about beaches and got a commercial on books!,"To whom it may concern,I was interested in a list and a quick read about the best beaches on the Big Island of Hawaii. What I got was an ad for me to buy some books on the subject. I'm sure a new search will get me what I want, I'm just tired of the commercialism!Arctic PenFrom the Big Island in Alaska"
2,You can buy the book if you like Book collecting!,"It does not help you to find any solution related to the programming problems with C++ Borland. Also, the book has a very poor index."
1,Not the message you want to give your kids,"This is just not up to the caliber of the original books....The behavior and comments of the children in the story convey themessage that learning is unpleasant and museums are boring - - not themessage I want to give to my children. In addition, George climbs adinosaur fossil and the museum director states that this activity isok, because now the children are not bored by having to be at thedull, old museum. This book was a gift which we have removed from ourbookshelf."
5,Curious George plus dinosaurs equals a new favorite book!,"If your kids love Curious George and are also dinosaur fanatics, this book is for them. It combines two of our kids favorites, and you can't beat that....anytime you can find a book that peaks their interest be sure to invest in it. It will foster a love of reading that will last a lifetime."
3,"Not bad, but not the same","This book is "" adapted from the Curious George film series"". The illustrations are different from the original, and even from the ""Illustrated in the style of H.A. REY"" both of which I feel are much better.The story is about CG who goes to a museum and gets into ""trouble"". It is a very short episode that doesn't really teach anything. Maybe its because I didn't even know there was a film series.I recommend the 3 book miniature set of originals, and ""CG goes to a chocolate factory""."
4,"Lots of good, tasty meals","While not as useful as her 300 Calorie One-Dish meals (for me, anyway), this has been a welcome additiion to my cookbook library. I usually do not make the entire menu she outlines, and some of her side dishes are no-brainers, (no cookbook necessary!)but the main courses are great. She uses common ingredients in new ways - not the same old stuff as in all the other diet cookbooks. My entire family (including 2 preteens)have liked everything I have made from the book, and I have had to tell my husband that it is lo-cal. I like to cook, so if you just want simple things to slap together, this book may not be for you, but if you have between 30-45 minutes to make dinner, you will like this book."
2,Out of Date,This book is so out of date. Maybe one of two good recipes. I tried most of them. bland or just strange. Catchy title but that is about it.
1,"Overpriced, discontinued product that works...","I have been a loyal Mr Clean autodry guy for four years. P&G discontinued product last year and now the only source for these dang filters is eBay and Amazon! Now you have to go to a hillbilly sellers that bought these filters from a wholesale liqidator for a buck a piece and these guys have the Gaul to charge $35 for a three pack? If you are addicted to the system its your only choice, just ween yourself from the autodry system and buy a shammy."
4,Works as advertised,"I've used this system for the last several years on my Jaguar XJ8. I normally would have to clay the car on a regular basis to get the water spots and stains off the clear coat, but not with this system. After rinsing, I use a towel just to get the large water drops off and then let it air dry. ZERO water spots and stains. Great way to help preserve the finish on your car.Have pretty hard water here so I too don't get the full 10 uses out of each refill. Makes it a bit on the expensive side, but it's worth it.My local Pep Boys no longer carries this product claiming ""it's too hard to get"". Amazon FTW."
2,shipping time disappointment,"it hasnt arrived, but if should have since it shipped on jun 01 and arrived in vernon,ca. jun 02. So i would have thought it would have arrived early than the targeted shipping date since vernon, ca is in the Los Angeles area and i am in san diego so why is ups holding my package until the 8th of jun to deliver? this is the reason for the 2 star rating, very dissappointed in the shipping status. Dont get me wrong the product works great it cuts the amount of time i spend washing and detailing two vehicles."
2,This smells great! Looks & tastes bleah!,"The instructions on the bag are WRONG: If you follow the directions, you won't get 5 servings! Plus it doesn't ""magically turn purple"" but a pale bluish-gray that looks like the stuff Luke Skywalker had for breakfast with his aunt & uncle before he went off to find Old Ben Kenobi"
3,The Wildlife and Scenery of Europe (VHS Video),"Description from the back of the cover:The world of animals indigenous to Europe is extremely diverse. There are a million different species in its vertebrate populations. Beyond that, Europe has an abundant variety of plants. They inhabit the terrestrial crust and decorate the enchanted landscapes in an infinite variety of rare, spectacular and common species. This program covers seven of the major types of vegetation that cover the European continent, including the following species: birch tree, holm oak, purslain orach, lapland willow, swamp vegetation, hornbeam, nettle, edelweiss, chestnut tree, holly tree, cork oak, beech tree, marram, fir tree from Cephalonie, and the pine tree from Alep. Running time: 52 minutes"
3,A little disappointed,"I use Chef Paul poultry seasoning all the time. With all the good reviews on Chef Paul's, Pizza & Pasta Magic I ordered a bottle and have sprinkled on my pizza a few times and was A little disappointed in the flavor it seemed a little flat to me. But I know taste is subjective"
5,The best pizza and pasta spice we have ever used!,"This pizza and pasta seasoning is just what it says it is, MAGIC! It provides the right blend of spices for your Italian cooking and it is great when mixed into pizza or pasta sauce, meatballs, or any dish. The wonderful thing about it is that it adds no calories, no fat, no salt, no carbohydrates and no MSG to your food. It also contains no preservatives.It is also very good for soups, salads, egg dishes and almost any casserole. There are some very good recipes on his web site and I like the breakfast pizza, it is pretty good. We love this product and as I write this review I see that we are almost out of it so it is time to buy some more! I recommend it to you."
5,very nice binoculars for twilight and astronomy,These are wonderful binoculars for viewing the night sky. I had been hesitant is getting these as I already owned a 10X50 pair of binoculars from another company and was not sure that these 9X63 would be that much better. These 9X63 are fabulous.... I can make out the moons of Jupiter with them. I was also very impressed testing them out at twilight and being able to see into areas with deep shadows. These are much larger than the 10X50 I owned but easy to handle.
3,Diamond in the Rough,While it isn't the best novel that I ever read. It's not bad for Nicole Richie first novel. The novel revolves aroud Chloe and her friends and the behind the series look at Lifestyles of celebrites and their antics. Some of the characters draws close to being autographical. I looked forward Nicole next novel. Hopefully each novel will get better and better.
1,"Nicole, go away! Talentless hack","I saw this book at a bookstore and wanted to see what the buzz was all about. This book is awful. You must realize that for everyone that we know to be famous there are thousands that tried to be famous, but were unsuccessful but I cant come to think of why this girl is famous for besides the drug bust, sex tapes, daddys fame and all that other drivel. Nicole, please go away! You have no talent!!!!!"
1,emilie,This book is so juvinile and ridiculous that I couldn't finish reading it. The whole story is a run on sentence.
1,Boring,"I bought this book because I admire Nicole for trying build a career of her own. The problem is it should not be as an author!This book was so boring and uneventful, it was like reading a young spoiled rich girl's diary, with nothing shocking. I wish she gave the book more depth and detail instead of feeling like you are in the middle of a sleepover party.Save your time and money."
1,So Nicole's a writer now?,"Not likely. She can barely talk without saying something stupid, let alone write a whole novel using the same dialect she uses; from what I've seen that is. The whole book stikes me as very juvenile; something written by someone in middle school. I strongly suggest not even bothering with the book; I felt like I had wasted ten minutes of my life reading the first six pages. Avoid!"
3,Diamonds,"I was just a little disappointed with this book. I wasn't expecting much, but I was curious to find out what happened between the whole clan. I think it could've definitely been written better. But all in all, it was a good read if you like stories about twenty-somethings with more money than any one person should ever have. I wouldn't read it again, but I did like it."
1,The fact that trees got killed to make this book sickens me,"This book and this ""author"" represent everything that is wrong with our dumb-as-bricks culture - rewarding people for being rich and stupid. How this was published when real authors are struggling just to get their work read is amazing. The publishing industry should be ashamed of itself."
2,Very boring book,"It's like Nicole Richie wrote the book about herself but did not want to be responsible for her actions. She bashes on many of her so called friends in the novel and the text is boring. It took me forever to finish the book because I constantly was so bored. The story was about drugs, changing boyfriends, back stabbing friends, and partying. I thought it was going to have more substance than it did."
1,Seriously one of the DUMBEST books EVER!,"I absolutely adore ""chick lit"" and celebrity novels, I was so excited to finally read the book - yet, it left me extremely disappointed! The story has no substance whatsoever, the plot is inconsistent, basically it's like an 8th grader wrote it. I had no reading pleasure at all with this book. It was like reading the diary of a junior high brat who lives in California. And NOT an entertaining one at that. Ugh! A complete waste of time. Do yourself a huge favor and don't bother with this book!"
1,Awful.,"She has seemingly done everything else so why not write a novel? Well I'll tell you why not, because this story was badly written. The plot has too many similarities to her actual life for my taste. It doesn't seem like it took an awful lot to write this. I hope, if there is another novel writen, that Nicole can take time out of her ""busy"" schedule to write a real book and while she's at it, she needs to find talent cause she has none!"
3,Trashy Novel,This is a good read if you like trash. I loved the take on Paris Hilton...or her alter ego in the book!
2,Not the best...,"but not the worst either. I read this book in two days, it is that easy of a read. Nicole claims to not be writing this book about her life but you can see her making references (or subtle insights) to stuff we have heard and read in the tabloids about her. Not literary genius by any means but what can you expect? If you are bored and have nothing else to read, this is a good book. But this wouldn't be a first pick for me ever again."
5,Sensitive and spontaneous writing,Really enjoyed reading that novel;Exciting sense of detail and exquisite humour.Fresh and witty words; stylish and friendly narration.Great book.
1,"Finally, something worse than cancer!",Steal this book. Then burn it. The public will thank you for your service. Nicole Richie needs to understand that she has no talent and to go away!
1,Talentless,"The answer to my headline is NOTHING! So what! She's a burnt-out celebrity that has done nothing but party through-out her career. How foolish to idolize Nichole Richie! Her story is nothing new, but because she has a BIG NAME, it sells like profound truth! Ask any Christian counselor, and they will have dozens of stories that are just like Nicole's. Plenty of people have gone thorugh worse and have come out better."
3,Easy Read,"This was an interesting, fun, and enjoyable read.It should be something you bring to the beach or when you're able to sit down for a few minutes. I didn't usually want to put the book down, but when i did, it was easy to come back to."
1,Crap,"If you like books that are about (and written by) self indulgent spoiled rich kids then this is the book for you. This is her attempt at being a serious author? How many serious authors do you know of that fill their books with glam shots of themselves? Are we supposed to be impressed by all the cool ""celeb friends"" and velvet rope BS? Don't feed these celebs ego's anymore please. There are plenty of books out there actually written by serious authors with talent. And don't believe for a second that no one helped Richie write this."
5,GUILTY PLEASURE,"Nicole is hot. The book is hot.I couldn't put it down. It is such an easy read. It's like reading a PEOPLE MAGAZINE all about Nicole.The characters are so fun and very true to life. Nicole writes like she's telling me a story on my cell phone. I recommend this to anyone who likes to know what's hot right now.BONUS: I got to choose the book cover I wanted, and there were surprise photos in the middle of the book. What a deal!!!"
4,Give people the benefit of the doubt,"Writer's write what they know and to make sense of their own experience. You can't dump on someone just because they can't relate to the middle class. In comparison to Paris Hilton, Nicole seems to be getting somewhere besides living off her father's name. I'd like to give Nicole the benefit of the doubt and congratulate her for doing something on her own.I am by no means a Nicole Ritchie fan. However, I found her book to be interesting since I don't know much about the Hollywood scene. You can like or not like this book but please, give people the benefit of the doubt. Just becausethey were screw ups before doesn't make them screw ups for the rest of their life."
5,Great book,"****Warning Spoilers****In Nicole's first book (hopefully not last), she tells the story about Chloe Parker who was adopted when she was a little girl on Prince's 1984 purple tour. Sound familar? Chloe grows up in clubs dancing to the music. She starts doing drugs at age thirteen and is thrown into a reality commerical with her ""fake friend"" Simone in her early twenties. At the beginning of the reality show, Chloe decides to check herself into drug rehab and comes out sober and fifteen pounds heavier.Anway, not to spoil the rest of the book, let's just say after a major gossip scandal she gets the biggest surprise of her life.I really liked this book, Nicole can really write and her book only has a few pictures unlike a certain person who's ""autobiography"" is filled with nothing but pictures and quotes.``Katrina"
2,"Not that I was expecting great literature, but...","I read it in about a day with extremely long breaks otherwise it would have taken me about one hour and a half. And I'm not a particularly fast reader.It's so predictable, and soo slow! I wasn't expecting anything special, just some kind of trashy novel about people with nothing to do. That's what it is, but it's flat and unexciting. It's a real pity, it had potential.All in all- okay if you have nothing better to do."
2,pointless,"i was very excited to read this cos i thought it would dish out on a lot of ""gossip"" about the stars. it did, however, it seemed like a very pointless story. no intruige into the main character and the fact that nicole herself was the narrator made it worse. i suggest if you can borrow it from someone, do it and dont waste money on a purchase!"
1,Why do people with no talent think they should write books?,Being famous does not qualify you to be a writer. And this is most certainly true for Nicole Richie. Stick to bad reality T.V.! This book is a waste of time.
1,Your only encouraging her,"If you choose to read this book you should strongly look at yourself, your values, and why you would promote/encourage this untalented bimbo to take your money!"
5,Extraordinary!,"I have long held that Nicole Richie is capable of great things. Yes, she is the child of a bigger-than-life superstar. Lionel Richie has cast a long shadow on his daughter. Lionel is bigger today than he ever was and I only hope Nicole can come to terms with fact that she'll never be beloved like he was. But she then has to realize it's not her fault -- she must embrace who she is. But not too hard an embrace, don't want to snap any ribs! I thought Nicole did a great job with her spelling as I only saw a couple of questionable arrangements and the numbering of pages was flawless. Remember Nicole, you are somedbody, too."
1,What is the world coming to...,"when people who are simply ""friends"" of someone famous have the nerve to write a book? I hope she's paying Paris royalties for all of this because without her she'd be nothing, and she knows it! She aint even Lionel Richie's daughter, so whatever."
1,Give Me a Freakin' Break,"I bet you anybody could read this book in a day or two. Obviously Nicole's vocab is lower level and full of catchy, hip phrases. Can we just quit blowing up these rich kids egos and get our own lives. Try reading a real book."
1,Hmmm.... not sure what to say....,"I'm not sure what to say about this book. I admit that I wanted to read it, so I decided why not? It wasn't very entertaining and at times I didn't care about the characters bcuz I didn't think they were developed enough for me to care about them. I didn't have any expectations about this book. To me, it is what it is. If you want to read it, I said do it to satisfy your curiosity."
1,"Nicole, your just a waste of air. Go away!","Saddens me that paper, money and people's time were wasted on such a shallow, selfish, immoral product."
3,It's not going to win a prize but it was funny and enjoyable to read,I enjoyed this book and found it very funny! It was trashy and easy to read which is what I love in a book.Alot of the characters were very funny especially Simone Westlake and the lady who was in charge of the cosmetics company. It was a tad predictable but it had a great ending that made you feel good inside.Nicole Ritchie is a very talented young lady to have written a novel all by herself and I hope she writes a sequel.
5,Amazing,"Nichole Richie put her self out there, and you get a REAL look into what actually goes on in Hollywood. Its very intresting and fun to try to figure out who these people in the book may or may not be! It nice to get a story from someone who actually lived it rather then a reported who edits what he or she wants you to hear. The books amazing!!"
1,"Awful, lousy, and pointless","Well, may be not pointless because I guess she made some money off me, right? I always found Nicole to be the nicer of her and Paris. But wow, was this book awful or what? I hope she doesn't try to do another one, becuase there wasn't much to this one except a lot of nothing. Try to figure out what this book is supposed to be about, because I couldn't. And after a while, I just stopped caring, and now I'm not sure why I'm bothering to even write this. Wait, maybe this is a warning to all of you. Who knows! If anyone who has bougtht this book can explain to me its value, pleae please do."
1,Nicole Richie is trash,"This is not a book, It's a joke. The confessions of a woman who thinks trash, talks trash, has a trash lifestyle, and is human trash. she should work for the sanitation department."
3,aeroplane read,"i read this on the plane, so it took a couple of hours, and i didn't want anything too serious so I could get distracted. It's good, not great. I don't think it's ghostwritten, and yes, the whole chloe/nicole thing is a strangely veiled attempt to say it's fiction, not a biography. For all those who simply looked at her name, you did EXACTLY what you're not supposed to do, and judged the book by it's cover. this book is not SUPPOSED to be dickens; rate it against other chick-lit, not to kill a mockingbird. if you like a light read about a celebrity (who does actually do things, despite popular belief)who is effectivly trashing paris hilton, and talking about her struggle through drugs, then read it. if you're looking for a book with substance, look somewhere else. it's as simple as that"
1,Very Interesting but Disturbing Adventure,"The book focuses on the use of electronic implants to control one's thoughts and reactions. Some of the information is useful. Things like trying to help those who have epileptic fits control what causes an attack by sending an electrical message to the brain to stop the occurence. Unfortunately, Mr Delgado has very menacing intentions in other areas. He is one who believes in the administration of implants to individuals for behaviour modification. The intention to psychologically abuse anyone who deviates from societies norm. An interesting great question, who decides who is wierd and how do you define normal? These implants allow the monitoring of every thought and action whereby the tresspasser can see through your own eyes. Further information can be found on the mind control forum."
1,"I found it appalling, where's the Humane Society?","This is a book written by one of the worst violator's of human rights. He should be justly punished, perhaps with his own methods. If one could look at it as Horror/fiction ala Stephen King, it could send a chill up your spine."
4,Useful for high end users.,"This is a valuable book for those more complex research and survey problems and thinking your way towards a solution.It assumes a reasonable existing skill and you can make the most out of it by having those skills already.It is not ready made answers, rather more useful hints and ideas that you can use to sort things out yourself."
2,Not that great if you are looking for concise information,"I was surprised to find that this is almost a guidebook for university professors, rather than an information-packed how-to guide. There is more information on how to run the class than there is on how to execute meaningful market research. I regret spending the $$ on this particular book."
2,Didn't last long,"This is a great usb gaming mouse, for about a year. After that year, not only did the mouse click break (every time one would click, it would register as a double click, or not register at all), but the scroll wheel became worn after about 3 months of use. The product is good, nice weight, good performance, but does not last. I'd recommend investing the extra $20 and getting a higher rated mouse, such as a Razer or Logitec gaming mouse, that will give a higher performance and a longer lifetime."
3,Not good for my fine hair,"I have very fine hair but a lot of them so this brush cannot reach the sculpt. If you have fine hair but a lot, don't use this brush. TryThe DCNL K80002 Brosse Dresser Tortoise Porcupine Red Cushion Brushinstead. Other than this problem, this brush is good to tame frizzy hair without serum or other styling products. Very pretty brush."
4,Good Old Fashioned Low Budget Fun!!,"STMD! is one of the most fun and enjoyable low-budget films I've seen in quite some time. Director Jeff Smith (who also served as co-writer, cinematographer and editor) definitely shows his love of underappreciated 80's horror films with this movie! Anyone who loves the cheesiness, preposterous situations, wacky and stereotypical characters of 80's horror movies will definitely love this very tongue-in-cheek homage to the past.STMD! definitely lives up to the qualities described in the poster and then some. It has all the ""excessive violence"" and ""gratuitous nudity"" that is reminiscent of those entertaining 80's horror movies we all love. I had a blast watching STMD! From the 80's outfits that the stereotypical characters wear to the blood splatter to the goofy tone I just couldn't get enough!"
1,3 Stars????,"How can anyone rate this more than 1 star? This was awful in so many ways. Terrible acting, direction, story. Anything that might have worked was just sunk by the combination of the awfulness of the multiple problems. Whatever camera they used looks like a 25 year old camcorder because the film is so dark and grainy throughout. I managed to sit through the whole thing and nothing can save this one from being one of the worst films I have ever seen. I have seen junior high kids shoot a horror film among themselves that looked, sounded and had better effects than this disaster. Unless you are having an Ed Wood bad picture party, stay away from this."
1,Very disappointed,"I should have paid more attention to the reviews. Being a fan of horror satire (SCARY MOVIE etc) I thought this would be a great addition to the ones I already have. It isn't. In fact, it isn't even staying. I'll give it away as soon as I can find some poor unsuspecting soul who'll take it. It was a waste of my time and money.We have old looking teenagers gathering at a house that has a bad history. The resulting blood/mayhem is predictable and boring. Couple that with bad audio, non-existant effort on camera work, shoddy sets, amature actors and a script that should be shredded, we have a movie here that should come with warning labels. I'm thinking ""DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE"" or ""IF YOU LIKE MOVIES WITH NO BUDGET, NO TALENT, NO HUMOR AND NO REDEEMABLE VALUE THIS MIGHT JUST BE WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR""Normally I try to find something good to say about the things I review, but honestly, this one totally defeats me."
4,I like this mask,"I have never used sleep masks before, but the brightness of my bedroom from street lights encouraged me to buy one. I like this one very much. I found the terry cloth soft and comfortable. The grains in the pouch that hold the scent move around to be made more comfortable. One thing though, this mask is very warm. In the winter this is fine, but now that spring is here this is too warm to wear without cranking the air conditioning up very high. The scent is nice, but it seems to have worn off quickly."
4,Straps should be adjustable,"Sleeping masks that press on the eyes can inhibit REM sleep as the eyes need to move and flutter during this stage. I had to enlarge the elastic straps. Otherwise, a very comfortable, nice smelling mask."
4,Rat Daddy,"This film is about the breakdown of the bourgeois family. It is very indebted to the films of Pedro Almodovar and Luis Bunuel. The head of the house brings home at rat. As a result, everyone including the maid, starts acting out their latent desires. S&M, suicide and incest are the rules of the day. Eventually the family realizes that they don't need the rat as they have all been liberated by it and are now free. It becomes apparent that Dad is the rat they need to get rid of. Who needs him? All he does is sit around and read the paper and allow everyone to do whatever they please. It is interesting and some of the sex scenes are very explicit, but it is not for everyone."
5,How do you spell parody?,"I am amazed at many of the reviews here that take this film so seriously. The title itself should give away the intention to make a film that parodies sitcoms and soap operas.In my view, it is not only successful at doing that, but plays with audience perceptions and biases in a very clever way and misleads us brilliantly. It is all in good fun and you should enjoy it too if you don't take it too seriously.Ozon is probably the most original French director working today and it is well worth the time spent to see his other films. He is not that well known in France and this movie shocked some French friends that I watched it with, so question your own prejudices a bit and have fun with this."
4,"An undoubtedly disturbing, but clever movie","Digusting and disturbing are probably the words that come out from you after you have watched the movie. Yet, it does not mean that it is bad. Sitcom is a very clever movie indeed. This movie's humour lies on who should exist, the sexually 'normal'? or the sexually 'indecent'? The climax of the paterfamilias killing the whole family is followed by the anti-climax of the family killing the indifferent father figure. Are they killing the rat or their father? We should think about it. The dialogues and plot are entertaining, but at the same time, also pathetic as they reveal the deep isolation among members in a dysfunctional middle-class family."
3,Click no if you disagree,"Gross. This movie is one of those gross movies that people will hate or love.Me? I didn't love or hate it. I'm used to dysfunction. Everyone in the 20th century is.The story is, as one reviewer put it, a twist on ""The Metamorphysis"". It's bizarre, fun, morbid. It's actually quite simple.THis movie isn't for everyone."
3,soupy boy is a funny but kind'a corny,"i read soupy boy. The author is Damon Burnard, i think he is a good author i enjoy reading he's book and i would'nt mind reading another one of his books it is kind of a corny super hero book with some funny gags it starts off by telling you how soupy boy ganded his power and i wont tell you how he does and he adds a different twist by you decideing the out come of the story and he gives you a choice twice and I GIVE IT 3 OUT OF 5 STARS IT IS A GOOD BOOK BUT A LITTLE CORNY"
4,It is what it is,"It's a replacement bag, it arrived on time. It's just not quite as impressive as the vacuum."
5,Sebo Filter Bags,"The filter bags are very easy to install and are sturdy. I love the lid to close them, so not all the dust comes out as it is with other type of bags. They last me a long time, even with dogs and kids in the house. Great product!"
1,disappointing.....instruments out of tune,Would return this CD if I could....very disappointing out of tune instruments are very disturbing even though it is a historical recording...unexciting
4,Horror in the Movies,"I liked this book mainly because it gives a lot of information on early horror films, such as Nosferatu and The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. Since it was written in 1986, it isn't very modern, but I personally don't like modern horror movies. It does however talk about films like Friday the 13th, A Nightmare on Elm Street, and Halloween, which are sort of modern."
3,not good seal,Product description says there is an air tight seal on the canister. The lid falls out of it and is NOT air tight. I am not completely satisfied with the canister quality.
2,Not what I thought it would be...,"This does not have nearly as much space as one would think. My daughter does not have a huge collection, but still, the space is about maxed already. Also, two of the doors on the compartments do not close well. And the doors do not open all of the way, so it is not too easy to get everything in and out. She received this as a gift, so I did not want to go through the trouble of a return--plus what other options are there for storing all these tiny pieces anyway (no, I'm not aobut to spend $25 on the rolling suitcase!)?? Bottom line, you are probably better off saving your money and using ziplock bags in a nice storage container."
5,Andy-the best artist least-known to western society!,"The insert says that he is the most bootlegged musician in the world, and there is a good reason for this. Andy is a gifted artist. His voice is smooth but raspy and so easy to listen to. He is also diverse, singing in several different languages including English, Persian, Hindi, Arabic, Armenian and Spanish and utilizes music from each of these cultures. His song Pendulum is great, one of his best, but he has so many good songs to choose from. Check out his previous CD's. Please listen to him if you have a chance. You'll be missing out if you don't."
4,Very diverse listening experience!,"Great Arabian music along with some other genres. There's a bit of club/rave/electronic/Latin/Rai - lots! I LOVE the songs Pendulum, which is the English version of Chie Begam on the Desert Roses & Arabian Rhythms Album, and the song In My Mind. How have I never heard of him before?!"
3,ok but not great,"Marc Singer (V and Beastmeaster) patrols space as Commander Steve Krieger who ends up in a monstrous situation. This movie is similar to ""Alien"", but it lacks the really in depth character development that was crucial in that movie. The acting here, in my opinion, is also more mediocre.The dialogue is a bit hokey at times and the alien scenes aren't terribly terrific (low budget special effects). I would, however, recommend this movie to sci-fi buffs who have already seen the four or five dozen really good sci-fi movies out there. It's an alright movie, but don't expect anything spectacular here."
2,"good try, but did not work................","Splashy special effects highlight this so-sosci-fi movie about B movie favriotemark Singer as a pilot of a ship that is called tocome to planet something-rather to help some scientistsstop an alien monster. The acting is not to convincingand the dialogue is hockey, making this a fun and cheesylittle monster flick. Like the previous Viewer said, there isnothing to special here, but fans of ALIEN copies will have a good time."
1,Reign of the amateurs...,"This is basically a home movie with a fairly large budget.Some of the worst acting to be seen... anywhere...A rather pathetic attempt at an ""Alien"" clone of a film. The commentary at the back of the box promises ""..State-of-the-art special effects.."" - my response to that? HA HA HAThis may all sound rather harsh, but this film takes amateur film making to a new level of... amateurishness..!The only decent thing in it are the sets, and the lighting which nearly succeed in duping you into thinking that this is in fact a 'real' movie.And they say it is hard to get funding for a film..."
1,Not Funny... Old Clips.... Not Bloopers,"Terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible ! A collection of old clips that are not only NOT bloopers they are not funny, amazing or special in any way. A lot of repeating the same clips for no apparent reason. I would not even pay 98 cents for this DVD. I was forced to give it one star only because it was a required entry."
3,The study guide only had selected answers,"I thought it was ok because the guide did not have all of the odd problems worked out. Usually a study has all the odd problems answered. Without it, you are left wondering if the guide has an explanation at all for the problem.When the it does have the answers, it explains it very well and does not leave any doubt about the solution."
1,Misleading advertisement,"The advertisement for this book on Amazon.com says that the author is David S. Moore. This is false. The only way that you can tell that it is actually by William I. Notz and Michael A. Fligner is to look at an enlarged image of the front cover of the book. Another disappointment about this book is that it uses many of the same problems that occur in Moore and McCabe. Except, perhaps, for slightly more detail, it just seems to copy the problems in Moore and McCabe."
2,Don't Waste your Time!,"Having enjoyed Salinger's, White Darkness, very much, I was very disappointed in this author's first book, Behold The Fire. While the basic plot was okay, Salinger's characters were too shallow and poorly developed, his writing style was too disjointed and after a while I found myself not caring at all about what was to happen next. My main goal became to just finish this book, which was a struggle. While I, obviously, don't recommend Behold The Fire to you, I would highly recommend White Darkness by Salinger. It not only has a well-developed plot and interesting characters, it clearly demonstrates Salinger's improvement as a writer."
3,Rather Dissapointing,"All in all an average book. The basic plot was excellent, but the telling of the story was too shallow. By the end of the book, I was reading just to finish it. I was dismayed by the destroyer/battleship mix-up; shouldn't someone have caught that before it was published?"
4,"Great Speakers, Doesn't Charge IPhone 3G",Great speakers.... but just calling out that it can't charge the new iPhone 3G. (You can use it to play music from the iPhone 3G though.)
4,Room filler/Bose DESTROYER,"Amazing speakers. Use them at parties. They aren't going to ""blow the windows out"" but they'll impress your friends and family. The portability is a fantastic plus for such small, powerful speakers."
5,Excellent product at a great price,"I have been very pleased with this product. My husband and 5yr old keep trying to take it away from me. It has great sound, is so portable, and compact. I wanted something convenient to take outside and this works perfectly."
5,Sounds good.,Very good sound and store well for college and travel. I would rank this as a very good buy.
5,Great versatility,"I'm very pleased with my inMotion iM600 portable audio system. The sound is great with my new ipod both in our dining room where it fills the room, to my classroom where it serves well as background and as a teaching tool at higher volume and in a presentation room of moderate size. The sound is excellent and is precise enough to hear individual instruments whether I'm playing jazz, classical, or popular songs. The rechargeable battery means I don't have to drag around an adapter or search for the closest plug - I can set up the system based on the best place for the music. The base folds easily so the unit fits into my back pack or other carrying case. The remote control is small but works well enough though I've usually chosen to adjust volume via the ipod. The ipod sits firmly in the adapter that fits in the well of the base. This unit is a huge value and delivers all it promises."
3,iM600 Audio system for IPOD,Liked this product but it went kaflooey within a month......I will say that Amazon handled the request for return wonderfully. I love Amazon for shopping!
4,Wonderfull unit,"This is a great little portable and electrical unit for the price, it has great sound and is easy to take along anywhere. the only thing that they could fix is the way the ipod sits in the unit, I wedged a little piece of rubber behind it to keep it steady when I change songs. otherwise its a great buy.Sandy"
5,Altec Lansing iM600,"After reading many positive customer reviews about this unit, I placed an order for one. Being on the West Coast, I assumed it would take 1 1/2 to 2 weeks to receive it. I was pleasantly surprised to have it in hand within 6 days! I've used the iM600 for about a month now and I totally agree with the majority. It could use a bit more bass, but for it's size and price, the sound quality is outstanding. The sound quality is best when using the SFX mode. When playing it indoors, there are no issues. However, when outdoors, I notice some distortion with the volume ""cranked up."" But, it's no more than what one would expect for a unit this size. The battery life is really good. I get over 4 hours of continuous use on a fully charged battery. I wouldn't hesitate at all to buy another."
3,Viable competitor,"Altec Lansing inMotion iM600 Portable Audio System for iPodThis ipod system packs a punch with its sound quality. Its design is compact and attractive.The only problems I have with this device is that my ipod nano doesn't fit into any of the adapter pieces that allow it to firmly stay in place therefore its difficult to make any adjustments to the ipod settings once I put it in the cradle because it gets dislodged and disrupts the play of the music. I also didn't care for the antenna. It akwardly jets out of the corner of the unit and for some reason, I can't get mine to adjust to the upward position, so it extends laterally from the unit. Otherwise, I think I got my moneys worth considering the cost of similar items in its category. It looks great, sounds great and it holds a nice charge if you want to take it out for a picnic."
1,Never worked,It never worked and was difficult to return to them. Then they lost it! Still trying to get it resolved a month after I sent the item back to them.
5,Stellar,"I recently gave this to my daughter as a Christmas gift. She said it is ""stellar"" (another word for awesome)!! The sound is incredible and the product is very lightweight for easy portability. I highly recommend this product :)"
4,"Yep, it's good","I looked around quite a lot before deciding on iPod speakers. This is a great deal for the price and the FM radio was what made me decide on this particular model - that and I'd listened to other Altec Lansing speakers and liked the sound.Plus: Small, light weight, nice look, good sound, good features (FM radio, video output, remote control).Minus: Would have liked to have a travel bag. The remote is not super functional but fine for my purposes."
3,Great Sound! But dock is messed up!,I bought this system for 80.00 and could not get it to work right off the bat! The docking system is messed up and I have read several reviews from customers who have the same problem. My I-Pod does not work unless you pull it forward on the dock itself or I finally got frustrated with it and figured out what I could squeeze behind it to make the I-Pod push forward on the dock to make the connection. I would like to know if I am among the few who have this problem because I love the sound but if all of these units have bad connections at some point maybe I need to look into something else.
5,Altec Lansing inMotion iM600,"This portable audio system for the Ipod is every bit as advertised. The sound is unbelievable for such a small speaker, with bass to boot! Because of its size it is very portable as well, plus it's got FM radio and allows to plug in another music player, not necessarily an Ipod. I also own an Altec Lansing inMotion IM7, which also sounds great, but it's much larger, and without FM radio. The only drawback was the relative lack of documentation; I was a bit lost on how to install the battery in the remote control, be careful with this."
2,Great... while it lasted.,"This product lasted for a little over a year before I started to notice malfunctions. The power button and other function buttons such as ""Source"" and ""Volume + and -"" stopped working soon afterwards. Despite the advertisement, it was actually unable to fit ipods and iphones snuggly without the purchase of (separate) docks. Very disappointing for the amount of money that was invested in this product. Warrantee only covered for one year. What a waste of $!"
2,AC Cord Failed after 1 year,"Loved this unit until the AC cord connection in the back of the unit no longer made proper contact with the unit and ceased charging the battery. For a while, I taped it into position but eventually this stopped working as well."
2,Useless after only 2.5 years!,"Bought this product new from Amazon on 2/19/2008. By mid-October 2010, all the controls had stopped working--no response to any of the buttons (on/off, volume, source, radio, etc.). Some days it would turn on as normal, play part of the playlist in my iPod, then suddenly stop and could not be re-started playing anything. Some days it would stop playing the iPod, but not shut off. Never relied on the rechargeable battery, always used the plug-in connection.Very disappointing. Paid $109 for this unit. It was quite good while it lasted--good sound, good bass, very nice looking unit. But two and a half years of service is just not acceptable."
2,Altec,Not everything about the product was disclosed. The control remote of the Altec Lansing inMotion iM600 does not work.
2,Sad,"Bought this for my son for college, initially sound quality was great, in fact his brothers would use it for outdoor parties etc. Then something went amiss and the the unit kept shutting down. Tried to troubleshoot and that did not work. It is now in garbage :-( So, it only lasted about 1 year. Looking for another and hope it lasts longer."
2,delicate,"the unit is flimsy and written instructions were poor; sometimes it would charge my I touch and sometimes it would not. It had difficulty adapting between I touch and I pods and now, seems to have given up entirely (have had it for about a year). Sound quality was adequate."
4,Nano 4G owners be warned of incompatability,"I have owned this Altec Lansing iM600 for more than a year and it has great sound, portability and docks/charges older iPods very well. It has been completely reliable. This is the sound system for my kids room, and for entertaining outside.We just bought a new 4G Nano to replace an older one that died, and buyers should know that the new Apple Nano does not work with this product."
2,Does not support Nano 4th generation,"I researched extensively before buying the Altec Lansing IM600. I absolutely loved the sound that came from the unit. It was easy to use and gave a nice, rich, room-filling sound.I was greatly disappointed when I discovered that the unit does not support the new 4th generation Nano. It will not charge the 4G Nano and the controls don't always work smoothly. You will not find this documented in the online description, nor even in the user's manual you receive with the unit. The only place you will find this out is if you download the online manual from Altec Lansing.If you have a 4G Nano, pass this one up."
5,Perfect For Travel,"We looked at every portable audio system out there for an upcoming trip to Hawaii and this product meets all of our requirements; it's small enough for travel, has decent sound quality, long battery life, and has a line-in input for hooking up non-iPod devices (yes there are some of us out there who don't own iPods).Because of its shape it is easily packed in our luggage without taking up too much room. The sound quality is really good compared to some of the other devices we tested. Only the Bose system had better sound quality (duh) but the size and shape of the Bose doesn't work well for travel and it's too expensive at $400.00.Regarding the bad reviews that complain about the telescoping antenna that comes out from the side of the unit, ignore them. Those people simply didn't pull the antenna out far enough so that it could hinge and rotate up and around. That is a non-issue for people who aren't stupid. Sorry for the slam people, but the problem is you, not the device."
1,Dead in a week,"It lasted one week. Then it broke. The little blue ""power on"" light came on, but no sound, no menu, no nothing. It never left the house.It was nice while it lasted."
2,Not quite enough,"Doesn't quite fill a room very well. At low volume it sounds fairly decent, but when it's cranked up a little the sound is very tinny and is hard to listen to. There is no adjustment for bass and treble frequency levels so you're stuck with what is offered."
2,The rechargable batteries do not work,"The sound is good, the size and design as well.The problem is that the rechargeable batteries do not work! That means the speakers have to be pluged at all times.Please I need assitance to solve this problemThe rest is all right."
5,"Good sound, easy to carry",Good sound and easy to move around with the rechargeable batteries. I'm buying another one for my sister's birthday!
3,just one thing missing,"i already own altec lansing ipod speakers, and was happy with the quality, so when i saw that this product came with an fm radio i was excited for the versatility. unfortunately, it does not run on batteries, which made it impossible for beach use."
2,"Outstanding functionality, poor durability","I really liked this product because the sound quality was good. It was easy to use, and it had an FM tuner. I have no complaints about the product while it was alive.Unfortunately, it had a tendency to break. The first one lasted for about 1.5 months. The second one lasted a little longer (2 months). Luckily the return policy at Best Buy is outstanding. They allowed me to exchange the items after they broke both times."
4,Sounds Great,"The sound is great for it's size, the battery lasts forever, and the digital FM tuner works great as well. Only thing missing is an alarm clock."
1,Dead Battery...,I think this is a great sounding system for such a small form factor. Not as dynamic as the Bose system but can fit easily into a suitcase. The FM radio is not as good as the iPal (I also own one) at pulling in weak stations but the iPod dock and remote make up for it. Now for the bad news: the battery refused to hold a charge even after 2 days on AC. I got a RMA from Altec Lansing ( I should have returned it to Amazon) and returned it to the company. One and a half weeks later I called them (Altec Lansing) and was told that I was on a fulfillment list for backorders: the item was unavailable without an estimated due date. So now I paid for an item that I can't use and don't know when I'll get it. I will not buy Altec Lansing products in the future.
4,GOOD UNIT BUT BATTERY IS DIFFICULT TO ACCESS,"LOVED EVERYTHING ABOUT THE UNIT EXCEPT FOR THE BATTERY ACCESS AND THE LACK OF INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO ACCESS IT,"
3,"Great ipod dock, worthless radio","First of all, if you want it for the radio, go elsewhere. It picks up one station(and not very well)! The pod sound is very impressive. But if you don't need the radio, I know Altec makes units without radio, that should be a better buy. I am using it with an Ipod touch 2G, with no problems. Excellent sound for small rooms and mid volume in larger rooms. Black shiny plastic, leaves finger prints easy. I bought from Electronics Expo, and had not read their return policy, I may have returned it due to it poor radio reception, but it looks like I would have incurred a hefty restocking fee. I need it mostly for the ipod dock anyways."
5,"More ""Bang"" for your Buck","Great sound...Tried the ""ihome"" and took it right back. Sounded like voices were inside a tin can(really bad). Then, I heard the im600 at a friends house. What a difference! I highly recommend this unit for the person who really wants to hear a clear sound. The only one above this would be the ""Bose SoundDock""Bose SoundDock digital music system for iPod (Black), but you have to pay $185 more then the im600...For the price you can't beat the im600....Enjoy!"
4,Well pleased.....,"It wasn't meant to be the Altec-Lansing; it was to be the Bose or the Klipsch. Just one of those last second ""could I save some $$ here....?"" things. However I'm well pleased with this buy. Mainly expecting to use it for ""background"" while deck-lounging and the very minor mid/bass shortfall will likely be more blessing (for neighbours) than curse (for me). Anyway there's always the sub-woofer if needed. Have checked everything from Relaxed/Dreamy to Heavy Metal and no disappointments to date. Nice product!"
1,Stopped working at 90 days!!!,"VERY DISAPPOINTED! Great unit when it works but it completely died, with zero function, at roughly 90 days. Too late to return to amazon. Now have to go through warranty process with Altec Lansing. They make the customer pay shipping for the return of their faulty product. Not happy at all!"
1,Another dead iM600,"I also have an iM600 that died for no reason. Altec Lansing ""customer support"" told me to buy a new unit. I wonder, is the second generation any better?"
4,"great gift, my mom very much likes it","I bought this as a gift for my mother after all the great reviews. She's been very happy with it. She likes that it has a small footprint, allows her to listen to the radio as well as the iPod (also a gift), and has a clock that isn't too bright. The remote doesn't come in too handy for her purposes and she doesn't use it but it's a nice to have."
1,Disappointed,"Product worked great when we fist received it and my Daughter loved the fact that it had a battery to take outdoor, but a week after Christmas the IPOD could not be seen or communicated by the IM600. The FM worked but the IPOD function would not. The unit has been returned to Altec Lansing for replacement."
5,Everything I expected for the price,"I bought this from Amazon and had it carry over to Thailand from my uncle (it was twice as much here for tax reason). I had been using it for three weeks and it lived up to my expectation. The sound, the price and the usefulness of the aux port and the radio function were all great."
4,Great but.......,"I have a 3 year old Altec Lansing inMotion which weighs half as much as this new one and uses AA batteries when I travel. I will keep it for travel, as the Im600 is very heavy..plus if you are in an area where you can't charge the battery, you are out of luck with the Im600 as the battery is built in! I plan to use the new Im600 around the pool, for parties elsewhere and if the power goes out. It sounds great and having a nice built in FM radio is a plus. However, my much smaller older unit is perfect for travel and I will keep it too. The best of both worlds!"
4,Very nice..BUT... the docking issue....,"Did a lot of online research, chose the iM600 for overall ratings and price range. Does everything well, except... 3 days in it starts to stop playing occasionally. If ipod is moved around in the dock it plays. After going back online I notice several complaints about the dock. I call Altec Lansing Tech Services and they acknowledge there have been complaints, but they have not been able to reproduce it at the lab. So, for now mine works fine with a small piece of sponge placed behind the ipod. But it sure seems like this is a weak spot on a great little system."
3,Not a real exciting sound,"iPod sound is awesome, but sound out of this dock is just OK. I am not a rabid audiophile and don't have a real high standard for sound boxes, but I expected a better quality from this unit based on the mfg's description. More importantly, I wish I had realized that the unit does not recharge the battery in the iPod. It has to be connected to the computer or an in-the-wall charger."
1,Altec Lansing Like new,"I purchased a ""Like New"" version of this item from Down2bizniz. I received multiple non or partially working or older model units over months of e-mails and frustration (78 e-mails, I saved them). I finally gave up and took a unit that worked (somewhat)but had no battery power. This was the worse on-line buying experience ever. By the time I got a partially working unit it was too late (3 month limit) to submit seller feedback. Customer service always responded, but all I received was junk or older models than advertised. Who has the time for this? Spend the extra money on a new one rather than on postage returning junk and avoid this seller. I wish I could tell you more about this unit, but I do not believe it ever worked right. It certainly did not work for long."
2,Sound is mediocre,"I bought this unit based on the reviews here at Amazon.Frankly, I am suprised to see all these rave reviews.I wasn't impressed with the sound at all. It was medicore at best.In addition, the remote control doesn't seem to work, and it has been documented. I have tested this unit with my ipod touch."
2,"Not a clock radio, not useful remote","1. The remote control is not fully functional. It does not navigate thru the menus of your ipod.2. For the alarm function to work, we need to keep the unit ON and its bright blue display is disturbing kids sleep.3. It is not a clock radio.I am returning this item to buy a actual CLOCK radio which can display time."
2,very unimpressed,"I'm not an audiophile, or terribly picky by any stretch, but this product totally failed to impress once it was turned on. The slightest bass (not gangsta rap or hip hop or 1812 overture)caused the whole unit to vibrate and the distortion was terrible. Sent it back."
1,Dead Battery & Volume Problems with Nano,"The sound on this unit is very nice, and the controls are easy to use but other than that it's a total lemon. Unfortunately, the battery on ours stopped holding any charge at all so the unit must remain plugged in to use it. That's a major downsize since we liked to move it around the house without the hassle. Also, on our Gen 3 nano, it causes a problem where the volume just goes up and up until it reaches the maximum. The nano does this even after it's unplugged from the dock until you issue a reset command. This of course loses some of the settings so we only use the dock with our Gen 2 nano at this point."
2,Mediocre Stereo,"This system was OK but too many of my songs -- especially the operatic and classical ones -- sounded distorted. I, therefore, had to send it back. I do not recommend it if you care about true sound."
4,Outstanding Richness and Depth for the Small Size,"I bought this unit used on Amazon for $40, a great deal. I already own a JBL Soundstage, which cost me $130, and find both models are crips and offer excellent separation. For the last several months, I've been listening to the iM600 in the living room and notice the following: First, the radio function renders inferior reception so that I never use it. Second, after getting a much larger JBL Radial, I really appreciate the iM600's depth and richness for its size. I must give it the highest recommendation but forget the radio.Update: The JBL Radial, which I got on Amazon on sale for $99, is by the far the best speaker I've purchased for my iPod yet."
2,"If you really love good sound, this will not be very satisfying","This is a really attractive product, easy to setup, and very portable but the quality of the sound is not very good. There is very little base response which makes the unit sound kind of hollow. I returned the item and bought the Logitech X240 speakers for only $30 at Circuit City. They include a small subwoofer and two speakers. For a small system, it has very good sound. However, it does NOT charge your ipod or provide an FM radio."
2,Is NOT compatibile with Touch g2,"Despite even the Apple site stating that the unit is Touch g2 compatible and the box having a sticker on it stating it as well, the dock will NOT charge the a Touch g2.The user guide is terrible. It makes no mention at all as to what the USB port on the rear of the unit is for.The sound is adequate."
3,Dock trouble,"I've had my inMotion for about 6 weeks. I love it except for one thing -- after a month, there was no sound when I tried to play my iPod. I figured it was something about the connection between the iPod and the dock. It turns out that the plug on the dock that fits into the iPod is slightly bent. I was mystified because I am a gentle user and don't even take my iPod in and out of the dock very much. In order to get it to play, I have to shim up the dock to change the angle of the entire dock or put a shim behind the iPod to change the angle it sits in the dock. I talked to Best Buy about this and was told that it is a routine problem for the inMotion and many other docking systems. They said they've even had the plug on the dock break completely off. They said Altec Lansing will send me a new one because there's a one-year warranty and they know it's a recurring problem. But I am probably going to return it and get something different since it appears likely it will happen again."
4,"Great sound, but the clock/alarm sucks","Tthe sound quality of Altec Lansing's iM600 is fantastic, and I was pleased that the iPod Nano adapter worked well, because I had a bad experience with an Emerson unit's adapter that did not work at all, and that unit sounded terrible. There are a couple things bad about the AL iM600: One, the clock/alarm system integrated to the iPod was awful. If you set the alarm on the iPod, you had to leave the iM600 on, and there was a low, but distinct hum which kept you from falling asleep. The other thing is the remote. Supposedly, a battery is supposed to be provided, but in ours, there was none, and there was no instructions in the manual saying what size battery belonged in there. There's a lot of quarter-sized batteries that would appear to fit, and if guess wrong, you can ruin the remote."
5,perfect for Ipod Touch,This is the perfect system for desktop radio and ipod. I have it in my home office and I'm getting another one for my kitchen now that I've tried it out. The sound is great at moderate volumes. This is not the machine for LOUD but it is exactly right for small spaces. The footprint is right - it's smaller than the lid to a shoebox. And the UI is sensible - no excessive or mysterious buttons. These people have design skills.
4,Perfect for the minimalist!,"I bought this to replace one of those large ""boom boxes"" with the detachable speakers, 3 cd trays, 2 cassette trays, and a radio. This systems sits unobtrusively on top of a bookcase and when you turn it on, the only noises it makes is the music! No more clanking and clunking of cd trays changing from one to another. I am not concerned at how loud it will go since I am using it mostly as background music for my massage therapy business, but I did turn it up much louder than I ever would and it still sounded great. I would recommend this to anyone that wants a nice looking, compact, and nice sounding system."
2,Buyer Beware,"Contrary to the description, this is not a clock radio. Amazon's description is deceptive - you need a newer iPod model, otherwise this unit doesn't function as a clock radio. To add a further insult, seller will not refund shipping charges and Amazon ignored the problem. Buyer beware."
4,If,I like the product however when received the battery was making noise and i had to return it and took long time to get new one again that's the only problem I have.
5,Amazing Product! Amazing Sound!,"Before purchasing this product, I borrowed a friend's bose ipod speakers (Can't remember the model, but the popular ones). The sound was only slightly better than these (Definitely not worth the price difference). The features of this product (FM Radio, easier navigation without remote, etc.) definitely out way the slight difference in sound production. The only bad thing I can say about this product is it is marketed as portable, but they made it out of a very easy to scratch and print plastic. (Very smooth and glossy). It is always covered with fingerprints. Not worth giving it a lower rating, but sometimes I wonder what designers of products are thinking..."
2,"Eh, Not so great.","I bought this after comparing several speaker systems for my iPod. I really like the the sound on the Altec, especially for its price. I also like having the FM radio built in.BUT.... the unit stopped playing my iPod after about a month."
3,Just okay,"There were a lot of positive reviews, so I was excited to get this for my wife's birthday. We have a Bose SoundDock, but we wanted something else for our summer home. I wasn't expecting Bose sound for the price, but even still we were disappointed in the sound quality. The bass was extremely weak, and the sound overall was kind of tinny. The packaging recommended adding on a compatible sub-woofer, but when we looked for it, we found that it had been discontinued. We ultimately decided to return the iM600 and got the Klipsch iGroove SXT, which we were much happier with. Now to be fair, the sound wasn't awful, it just wasn't that good, either. We did really like the design and portability of the iM600, and the receiver seemed to work okay. I think this would be a fine product if the music to be played on it didn't have much base, but we found the Klipsch to be much better for us in the same price range."
4,very good indeed,"first, let's get it out of the way, performance, especially of base, is necessarily limited by the size and shape of the enclosure. that said, we are quite impressed by what they managed to get out of this handsome unit(and there is a powered sub available if this is a primary system for you.) we use it at a vacation home indoors, outdoors, poolside, and on the golf cart. it is so useful, we bought a dedicated nano for it. the best features, besides the fine mid and upper range reproduction, are the internal rechargeable battery and its ability to recharge the ipod, as well as a good fm tuner and a remote for everything. we just keep it plugged in in the bedroom when not in use and it's always ready to go.nice size, nice sound, nice features, nice price."
2,Quit working within a month,Pros: It really sounds good for the price. I love the fact that it has a rechargeable battery.Cons: It quit working within a month. I am now waiting on a replacement unit. It cost $14.00 to ship it for repairs or replacement.
3,"Great sound, compact, BUT remote deos not work","I got it 2 days ago, the sounds is great its compact as promised and I am happy. The battery has nice long life, I got approx. 8 hours out of it, BUT as I said the remote deos not work, I tried new batteries etc. that was no help.However, I did call altec lancing tech sppt. 1-800-258-3288. They have a record of the issue and offered to send me another remote, no problem."
3,"Happy, but confused","This is a wonderfully slender machine, with excellent full sound, withone odd flaw. I get great sound from the radio and when I plug in aniPod through auxiliary, but only get sound through the left speaker when I use the iPod dock. And I've tried three of them (iPods). Sadly, when I spoke to Altec I got one of those responses that makes my blood run cold; ""That's not an issue we've ever heard of before."" Otherwise it charges quickly, runs for a long time and is all that is advertised."
5,Great ipod doc,"Good size, good design, good price, excellent sound, practical use with remote control...Just keep in mind that charging ipod but not iphone (can be used in fly mode though)"
5,"Compact, elegant and powerful","I got this for my iPhone. I works brilliantly! Rich, powerful sound from a compact case that not only plays my iPhone but also provides an FM stereo radio with several hours of play from the rechargeable Li-ion batteries. There may be other equally ggod or better iPod docking speakers but I couldn't find any with the mix of quality sound, compact ease of use, elegant design and reasonable price. Get this one. You won't be disappointed!"
4,iM600 portable audio sytem for iPod,"I am impressed with the quality of this product, good bang for the buck. Music is crystal clear, remote control comes in handy. I would have liked a little more control over the bass instead of spending extra for a separate system. Overall, I happy with the product, it has met my need"
1,video out does NOT work with new iPods...,"I bought this unit specifically because I read the outside of the box which says ""Composite video out - lets you play your videos and photos for iPod on most TVs"". Turns out this is not true. I called the company and they said it was compatible but did not work. When you attach the unit to your TV and try to play a show, it says 'please connect cable'. After I did some research I found that Apple wants to sell you their own A/V cable that has some sort of copy protection chip in it. That's fine - but Altec Lansing should change their packaging. If you read the specs on their website, they have conveniently removed all mention of the composite jack - nice going Altec Lansing, very sneaky. BTW I'll be returning this device ASAP."
2,"Adequate sound, but not as good as expected","After reading raves reviews on Amazon I bought the iM600. On plugging in my iPod the sound quality was very poor, much worse than the 10 year old portable CD player it was replacing (which wasn't much bigger in dimensions than the iM600.) Even the FM radio sounded awful through it.For this price, I'd expect something with halfway decent sound, but it failed to live up to the lowest of expectations.- UPDATE -I went to the local HiFi store and tried another one of these out, and the sound is heaps better. Looks like I got a dud. It doesn't change my rating though, as quality control in their factory is obviously lacking."
1,Worked great for 5 days!!!,I would have given this product 5 stars if it hadn't stopped working after 5 days of use. The radio was crystal clear and the iPod music sounded great! But on the 5th day it no longer recognized that my ipod was plugged in and wouldn't play my music. I sent the product in for RMA service (to be replaced) three weeks ago!!! Not a happy buyer.
1,Bad Service,The device has a problem with the volume and I email 2 two times for a warranty never respond
1,Do not buy from this seller,Do not buy from this buyer. They took our money and never shipped the item. Email the buyer 3 times and no response. Took the money as soon as the order was summited and never shipped the item. If Amazon does not refund the money I will never purchase anything from Amazon again.
2,"Its ok, but some glitches","I think i was expecting Bose performance from something with a discount price. My remote doesnt work to do anything but turn it on and off. I cant forward through songs or anything (could be user error maybe?) Also, even with the adaptor for the nano to fit snugly on the base, every time I turn the ipod on or scroll through for songs, it comes loose a little bit and the sound goes off in one or both of the speakers. Then I have to reposition it.But it looks nice, is portable and has decent battery life. So it does its job, but just some annoying glitches."
1,"iPod skips, Remote Stinks","So I wanted a speaker for my iPod for my birthday. Got this one. I have a 3rd generation Ipod Nano, 8GB. It worked for the first few tracks then started skipping. I know it is not my Ipods fault because we have another speaker in the house that doesnt make my ipod skip. Also, the only buttons on the remote that worked were the Power buttons and the volume buttons. It did not work to change the song forward or backwards. However, my boyfriend has a classic 30GB ipod and the remote worked perfectly on his Ipod.I returned this for a new one, thinking it was just that speaker. Same EXACT problems. I even got a new remote from Altec Lansing, who sent me a new remote for free.I really wish this had worked for me, because it looks nice, the sound was fine, but in the end the remote didnt work and above all, it skipped!"
1,Stopped working -- twice.,I love what this unit should do...........but my first one stopped working within the first 30 days and when I tried again with a replacement..........that one did the SAME THING within 3 months. :(
1,Stopped working...twice,I bought this iPod audio system. The first one stopped working within 5 weeks. The replacement stopped working within 1 week. Forget it. Find something else.
4,Works great...just as advertised,"We purchased this so that both of us could listen to the iPod. It works great for our purposes. We listen to voice podcasts, music and video podcasts. The range is fine for the price. The ability to fold and unfold the controls and the stand is most helpful for transportability. We would have also preferred to have a carrying case, but perhaps that is too much to ask for at this price. The battery works well, lasting at least initially 4 to 5 hours. Over all we are very satisfied with this purchase."
4,Great Ipod Portable Speaker for the Price,"I just recently got this as a Christmas gift and while there are probably better speakers out there, this one is pretty damn good for the price. I love the fact that it's portable with a strong battery. You can literally pick it up and travel with it room to room with ease. The sound is very good (not great), with some music played through the Ipod you will get a little distortion (could be the song though) but overall I would have to give sound quality a B+. If your looking for an inexpensive but very good sounding speaker to play your Ipod on and portability is important to you, I would completely recommend this product!"
4,Great Compact Ipod Radio,"Great little iPod radio....well worth the money. My only complaints are: no AM reception, and when you turn on the radio with the remote the ipod doesnt turn on with it. VERY good sound quality and with 5 or so hours of battery life its great to use anywhere"
5,"Does what it says for cheap, and with good quality","Cheaper and just as effective as the Bose SoundDock, and it comes with a Li-ion battery - who could ask for more?!"
5,Great sound and sleek design!,"I ordered this off of amazon after seeing it at Circuit City for $149.99. I've only had it for a week but it works great so far. The sound is excellent and I love how sleek it looks, its not boxy and doesn't have the giant display like the iHome. It still has the alarm and radio too, which I don't use but they're there if I need them. If you want a nice set of speakers for your ipod and don't want to pay $300 for the Bose ones, this is your pick."
3,Disappointing,"I made her brownies recipe, and it tasted like dried-out, mediocre, store-bought brownies. They didn't keep well because of the lack of fat, and at the end of 3 days, I tossed them out. After going to all the trouble of baking from scratch, I had hoped for more. It's not really her fault, I guess, because what can you expect from cookie recipes that use only 2 to 4 tablespoons of fat? Strangely enough, although the fat content is lower, the cookies are not that much lower in calories than higher-fat cookies that actually taste good. I would prefer to bake higher-fat cookies and eat just one."
3,comfortable,what can one really say about underware? I found the underware to be very comfortable and a very good fit.
5,mama said clean in case of accidents,"I have really big legs so this product was ordered 2 sizes larger than I needed. I was pleased with the fit and the quality of the brief. If you are in an accident and they cut your pants off, you can have some style."
5,Simply outstanding,"I don't know how or where they come up with all of this but it is simply great, I love it and am a big fan and it is a must have for sure."
4,Music is upbeat and kinda cool,I bought this CD for my wife and she loves it. When I sat down and listened to it I actually kinda liked it too.
3,Love isn't blind,"Craig Locksley is blind, and he has a 10 yr old daughter, one day he is walking with his dog, Delia Summers is speeding in her car, she runs up on the curb and hits the dog, Jenny.Craig reacts as you and I would, only because he is blind he picks up on things you and I would miss. He also misses a lot.Delia has finally found a man that her looks and smile can't charm, and she doesn't know what to do.She falls in love Craig, his little girl Alison as well as the dog Jenny.Delia has so much to overcome that the story loses the romance.Craig is so stuborn he almost loses the love of his life."
2,Garden Hose,"The product quality looked OK, and value was comparable to local stores. Online ad was skimpy on details like color of hose. A call to Amazon customer service prior to ordering produced an ""I think the color is....."" answer. Returned the hose and still looking for similar item in a brown or beige color. Art 12-8-07"
4,Must have for any serious Todd fan,A definite must have for serious Todd fan. Ignore the low quality editing and grammatical critique-it's like nothing else as an account of Todd's career!
3,What are words for?,"I bought this book and I'm about half way through it. I think I'd be farther through the book if it didn't make me so tired. I LOVE the information about Todd and his career -- for example, the story about sleeping on the stage of the club in Wildwood, NJ and using a tablecloth as a blanket.What I can do without is all the side stories. For example, when he talks about Todd being influenced by Laura Nyro, I don't need 5 pages about Laura Nyro's career. If I want that, I'll go buy a Laura Nyro biography.I agree with the reviewer that said that with editing, the book could have been cut by a third -- a lot of unnecessary wording.BUT, bottom line, it's great to hear Todd's story."
1,Ugh.,"I love Rundgren. He's a brilliant innovator; the kind of artist that inspires his listeners to think. His thoughts and his music are truly ""outside"" and often esoteric. Unfortunately, Todd has (in the instance of this book) inspired a well-meaning fan to make the mistake of publishing a saccharine biography without a reasonable command of the English language. There are some interesting facts contained in the text, but plan on heavy fatigue mining for these gems. You'll feel you've been bludgeoned by James' constant search for big words and synonyms in an effort to sound educated.Reading this was a truly painful experience."
4,PLEASE- get an editor!,"""A Dream Goes on Forever: The Continuing Story of Todd Rundgren"" is a dense, informative look at the early career of Todd Rundgren that contains copious amounts of fascinating anecdotes and facts that any Todd fan will find illuminating. The problem with it is that it is disorganized, repetitive and contains more typos and bad sentence constructs than a fith grader's book report. I had read this criticism before I bought it and everything I read is true. If it is ever reprinted, it could use the services of a good editor or at very least a proofreader.From a content perspective, the book contains a lot of interesting facts and interviews and is obviously well-researched with a lot of love. Todd comes off as the Tortured Artist with a bent toward career self-destruction but for long-time fans like myself, that's not news. It is definitely a great buy for TR fans but don't expect a polished piece of work just an enjoyable one."
1,Packaging Issues,"I have now received my second (replacement) copy of this DVD set. As with the first, the box is the correct one for the Legacy Collection set which is what I ordered.But twice now the DVDs contained inside have been for the special edition of only the original Wolfman film and it's special features DVD. The discs are being packaged wrong.Would love to see the films but Universal can't seem to do their job correctly."
3,Just Okay,"With each sequel, the plot becomes weaker, the acting terrible, and production values drop.Buy it used (not over $5) and you shouldn't be too disappointed on a rainy Saturday afternoon.(A few Irish coffees really help.)"
2,I never liked the Wolfman much.....,"I never found the movie to be that good, the sequal, Frankenstein meets the Wolfman is a kind of fun picture to watch and is really the only Universal team-up monster fight films that was at least interesting to watch(if however not all that spectacular.)"
5,a keeper,this has all of the original wolf man films. 2 disk set with 4 or 5 movies none of then are that long. each movie is black and white. a great collection.
3,Interesting piece of heavy metal history.....,"First of all, this album was NOT recorded in 1989. It was a demo that was recorded before their 1st full release. You can hear the talent and the song-writing potential here, but the band is still pretty undeveloped at this point so this couldn't fairly be comprared with anything they released on WEA or later.There are some good songs on this - ""Prisoner"" is my favorite. ""Prisoner"" shows up much later on their ""Back for the Attack"" CD, but this obviously was reworked extensively by that time. This is also the case with ""Felony"". The re-working was a good idea because the later versions of these songs are far superior to anything here.The production is actually pretty decent for a demo. All songs can qualifiably be said to be recorded in Hi-Fidelity.'Not a bad listen, but this is one of those 'for fans only' records."
2,Not a bad Demo but some of you have incorrect information!,To the reviewers who praise George Lynch's solos on this demo... Did you know that's not George???Don is the only member of Dokken on this album that went on to actually be in Dokken when they did Breaking The Chains.Don't believe me? Look it up on dokken.net
3,greg leon,"The long hair not sitting next to Don is Greg Leon, who was a guitar wiz in the day. He never did anything. Take this picture to a Dokken show and compare it with Don's presently hysterical orange wig. Don had hair in 79. In the Dokken DVD Unchain the Night the videos, Don claims no one, not even Dokken afficinadoes, had ever heard the song Liar, yet here it is on this disk and you can download it on his website. The Rogaine and the wig glue must be seaping into Don's brain. Guess the memory goes when you hit 60."
2,Pretty typical post-apocolypse sci-fi,I'm not a big fan of post-apocalypse sci-fi books and this one is pretty typical for the genre. The writing and plot are pretty average and there aren't too many big surprises even though the book is set up as a sort of mystery of what's in the package. We follow the central character Glenn as he goes about trying to deliver the package. Some weird sci-fi stuff happens in the process and sets up the ending.
1,Long on ideas; short on consistency; confused & poor style,"Many of the ideas here are fascinating, but unfortunately I found the world depicted to be an inconsistent melange of future tech: nanotech and VR and non-Euclidean geometries and genetic engineering and ...Chunks of heavy-handed satire stick out like sore digits, adding to the feelings of inconsistency.What was most annoying was the overuse of the trademark symbol, formulaic references to National Geographic, and the description of Tiffany as ""copy-protected""; products of laziness, or perhaps the author's prolonged enjoyment of jokes which tired very quickly."
5,The Genius of Terry Bisson,"Terry Bisson is an American legend. Simply stated, he is the greatest living author on the planet. A set of all his original works belongs on the shelf of every book lover.Pirates of the Universe will expand and enhance your imagination. His quality of writing can not be matched. It is a rare treat to read any of his current or future works."
1,Don't buy this !!!!!!!!!!!,It has two bars on the screen one on each side . When I tried to adjust my tv they where there on every setting. To me this ruins the product and I see no REASON to put these distractions there.
5,Sobre la teoría de la relatividad especial y general,Sobre la teoría de la relatividad especial y generalby Albert Einstein
5,A Slice of Texas,"Texas is home to many different musical styles, and Adolph Hofner is one of those artists who seems to capture nearly every one of them in his recordings. What strikes me is that while many would label his music as ""diverse,"" Hofner would probably have just called it ""music."" The fact that Hofner is not well known and celebrated nationally puzzles me, for I believe he is one of the great Texas recording artists of all time, which puts him in grand company."
1,Boring,"Sorry, but could not wait until this was over. Not interesting and certainly not entertaining! It starts off with good intentions and just doesn't go anywhere from there. Have your remote in hand."
4,Do Not Go Gently,"Along with a clutch of other recent small Australian films(Sommersault and Jindabyne),'Look Both Ways' breathes fresh life into an industry that is always under pressure to trumpet such ignominous big budget affairs as the recent Baz Luhrman fiasco. Other reviwers have staked out the considerable merits of the film, the feel of Altman's,'Shortcuts' is distinct. McInnes and Clarke are teriffic in their fumbling affair. The contrast between his photographic inner view of the world and her painterly, emotive one is ingeniously filmed. And the reduced locations certainly helps with the flurry of interlocked narratives; the railtracks and the graffitied wall, key amongst these. Wonderful effort bySarah watt and yes, the musical accompaniment was spot on."
5,I May Be Prejudiced But...,"...Verl Mott is my Father. I am also a writer. As his daughter, I thought it was my family responsibility to read his publication. I found the book to be very well written and informative. I know he put his heart and soul into writing it. I know you will enjoy reading it as well.Peggy (Mott) Bennett"
5,I'm afraid I will somehow lose this book....,"I bought this book for my ten year old son who has many fears...I thought it might help him. But both of us were absolutely captivated by it. The author has a gift for stating his fears in such a charming, natural and absolutely right-on-the-nose way. My son felt really good that there was another person who had some of the same thoughts as he. I would buy this book for anyone who likes to read, who is curious about life in general, has irrational (or so they think) fears, has children or who is charmed by refreshingly open honesty."
5,great added to lots of different foods,"This great seasoning was a favorite of mine for many different pasta dishes for years. It spices up a tomato based sauce just right for our tastes. Originally it was available in the gourmet store where I worked, then in the big grocery chain where I shopped. Now it isn't available in my area at all. Thanks to Amazon for carrying it (and contacting me when it was back in stock) so I can stock up."
5,One spice blend I wouldn't want to do without!,"I love this spice blend. Turns any pizza into something super tasty!I first tried this about 15 years ago, and I've stocked it in my spice cabinet ever since! I use this on everything from Eggs to Pasta to Pizza. There's no salt in this stuff, just lots of Herbs, Spices, and Parmesan! I like to use it together with the Herbal Blend Magic.Great Stuff! Be Careful though, it can be addictive!"
2,Broken when shipped,"Maybe it works, but either it was broken when it was shipped, or the battery was dead that it came with. Either way I have no clue if it's good or not. :("
1,"Great, if you arn't fond of watching the movies you buy!","This DVD player played ok the first few times i used it, but then it wouldn't really work! My DVD's would randomly pause, and play like in a slow motion! It'd take hours to watch 20 minutes. No matter how much i cleaned the DVD's or the player itself!One day i rented ""Gothika"" and tried to play it, but it wouldn't play. It said it was incompatible on my player! That was roughly 2 months ago, ever since that day it will randomly tell me that my discs are incompatible, even though i've played them without a problem before! Yesterday i bought ""The Haunting"", and tried to play it, and it said again, that it was incompatible! So i made a connection that ""Dreamworks"" films do not work in this DVD player! And i'd like to know why. It's very very odd...My advice, save your money! This DVD player is a rip off, and a horrible player!!!"
2,Dissappointing,"Coleman generally has decent camping gear, but this was not as well made as expected. There are gaps between the utensils and the handles, which will allow bits of stuff to get in there, and hard to clean. They generally didn't have a great feel to them, not being of high quality. I am returning them. They are decent, but not great."
2,not impressed,The roll up case is not secure. It would be better if there was a flap to keep the pieces from falling out. The silver ware itself is nothing special.
3,Silicone brush,"I bought this little silicone pastry brush in 2005. I lasted a couple years but then water started to get being the bristles and it started to smell. Then it came apart. It was nice while it lasted, but I wouldnt purchase again."
3,Not as great as i thought it would be,"I had this for a long time already- about 3 years. Almost every time i wish it had a handle.This is great if you are using it in a non hot environment. It doesnt really world well to baste things in the oven, or to put a eggwash on in the oven etc. You have to wear an oven mitt."
3,is there a trick to this?,"admittedly, i've never used a silicone pastry brush before, but i was surprised at how messy it was compared to my usual bristle brush. it's also a little hard to butter pans because the butter flicks up onto the metal handle, which makes it slippery and hard to hold. the quality seems good, though, and it's easy to clean!"
5,Wonderful!,This is by far the best critical treatment of Stendhal I have ever read! Ms. Algazi's book will not doubt become the definitive text for Stendhalian scholars.
1,Marilyn Werner: Thanks?,"To the obsessive compulsive shopper who dares not to take the time to view a books' contents, this will be an $ 7.95 plus tax lesson in irresponsible publishing. Marilyn Werner has the audacity to think that any of her thank you writing suggestions would be, at best, acceptable to a bride's worst enemy. There is no better way to validate a review than to quote the author herself . This is a thank you suggestion for receiving a desk set. ""For the past few weeks we have been opening so many gifts of linen, crockery, and ""frillery"" that George's interest has started to wander. Then along came your handsome desk set. You've selected a gift that appeals so much to both of us."" YOU be the judge."
1,Preposterous,I wish I read the above reviews before buying this book. I will be returning my copy as well. The only possible reason for keeping this book is for the shrieks of laughter it brings at the utter preposterousness of the author's examples. I'm wondering if this whole book is a joke. Even people married in the 60's would have trouble with it.
4,Useful Guide,"Even though the book was first published in 1968, it served as a very useful guide for writing wedding thank yous. The section that eloquently illustrates how to word late wedding thank you cards is worth the entire cost of the book. A gem!"
4,It was VERY helpful,"My sister-in-law used this book and gave it to me when I got engaged. It was a complete lifesaver for me.I did not copy these notes verbatim, but even reading through the ""old-fashioned"" phrasing in the sample notes gave me inspiration for writing my own. I find that the hardest part of thank-you notes is coming up with what to say after ""Thank you for the ___."" This book is full of ideas.I am actually buying a copy for my new sister-in-law to be, because I want to keep my own copy around for birthdays and Christmas."
1,Outdated & Unhelpful,"I bought this book to use when completing my shower thank you notes and it has not been very helpful. The sentiments are not heartfelt, but fake. The gift examples they give are not useful (telephone cart, sterling silver tea setting, chandelier) and it lacks helpful gifts like everyday place settings and everyday towels. The book desperately needs to be updated. Not for the Bride of the new millennium."
1,Close but not quite,"I couldn't finish this book. It suffers from a common device in books these days, having two intertwined stories, and alternating between the plots ever other chapter, creating a false sense of suspense and forcing the reader to read on. The problem is, only one of the plots is interesting. If the author had stuck with the twisted underground world of power, sex and death he created in the one plot (which had some potential), and avoided the other boring (just filler for a short story?) storyline, he might have written a good book. But as it stands now, plodding through the secondary story line to get to the ""good"" parts was just too much for me."
2,A bland hot sauce,"For well over a year, I have been using different types of hot sauce on different types of food. Before I started doing this, I only ever remember using hot sauce on barbeque sandwiches. Even though I have tried numerous types of hot sauce during this period, Chef Paul Prudhomme's Magic Pepper Sauce has set itself apart from the others as being one that I do not find to be striking. I tried this hot sauce awhile back, and all I remember is that even though it was not terrible, it was not pleasing, either. Recently, I was given another bottle of it and decided to give it another shot--I still think that it is just okay. It is not too mild and not too hot, and it has a sugary flavor that I am not pleased with. Overall, I consider this to be a dull hot sauce. I am still glad that I tried it, though. Actually, I rate this hot sauce 2.5 stars."
1,These are 0.5.... NOT 0.38,"I wanted extra fine - meaning 0.38 mm. Instead, these were 0.5. I wish someone would have clarified in the product description."
2,Very Discouraged,"I am very discouraged this book was not what I thought it would be. I was interested in a biography of Mr Campbell, but the weighted language of the king james detracts from the history of Mr Campbell."
1,Tools weak break easily.,I bought these to work on pc boards and psp's and xbox's but the tools tips often broke when applying any pressure at all the slightest torque and they broke.
5,Excellent value,"I work in the educational technology field and I use this kit on a daily basis. It is an incredible value, highly recommended!"
2,What a let down,"Having purchased this after playing roller coaster tycoon 2 and being excited for the new mode where you get to ride your own rides, I have to say that I'm very disappointed!The problem with this game is that they tried to make it too realistic. I would have been much happier with a game similiar to the second or first one that allowed you to ride your rides than what came out of this game. The whole scheme is completely different. Instead of having a large space in which to build multiple rides and put in lots of scenery. You are barely able to build rollercoasters to a length that is satisfactory. All the graphics look boxey and pixalated it just isn't the same. If you were a big fan of the second one chances are that you will not be as pleased with this game."
2,Not as good as Rollercoaster Tycoon 1,"I loved Rollercoaster Tycoon 1. It's one of my favorite games of all time. I thought 3 would be 3 times better! Better graphics, more stuff, you can RIDE the roller coasters, etc. But the game itself isn't as fun. Adding paths and rollercoaster track is a chore that is unpredictable. It never seems to go where you want. Also, the park management adds more things to handle but manages to be less in-depth that previous installments. It adds more things, but at the same time waters everything down.The one feature I did like was the ""Sandbox"" mode, sometimes it's fun to just go in with unlimited funds and build a super park without a care in the world. But overall, when I need my theme park fix, I just fire up 1 or 2."
2,Looked great until it crashed,"I played it for a good two hours, but then the whole program crashed on me and wouldint let me re-open it. i have windows 7 so i dont know if that made it crash or something else. hate to see a good game get a bad rate but something needs to get fixed on here."
5,AWESOME GAME!!!!!!,"My son and I have been playing this roller coaster game for over a month and still keep finding new features that amaze us. It's so enjoyable and totally addictive, it was way more than we even ever expected to get out of what we paid. We are just thrilled and fascinated, the best computer download we've gotten yet! SO FUN!!!!"
3,"Horrible Sequal, good game","Great game but if you want hours of fun chooseRollercoaster Tycoon 2: Triple Thrill Pack,it is easier to understand(and costs less money. Bact to Rct3 ' all-in-all it is a great game but horrible sequal."
5,great game for the money,"I actually ordered this for my daughter who is 12. She had a little trouble getting started as you always do until you learn the game but the graphics are great. I enjoy ""riding"" the rides after you build them. The night time lights are great. What I find the most amazing is how you can see your whole park that you built while riding the rides. It is like you are actually in the park. Great game for the money."
5,Addicted,Once you start you can't stop. It's so addicting and fun. It's best to keep a clock next to your computer so you don't lose track of time.
4,Creative/Entertaining,"I've had every series of Tycoon and this one seems similar to those except for some updated graphics, so the change isn't too hard to pick up. It's got new ways to run your park and new rides/animals. As far as downloading the game versus buying the physical product. The MP3 is def faster to get and easier to maintain, instead of waiting days for the game to arrive and once you have it having to put the product somewhere. Your amazon account saves your game so you can redownload to a new computer need be. Happy Tycooning."
5,Good Times,This version of the game comes with all the expansions and has lots of things to do. My son really enjoys the safari stuff. The water items are sometimes difficult to get working properly but it is still fun to play.
2,this sucks,This sucks i cant even get on the game.I try every computer and wont work.It wont let me play.Its a waste of money.Wont work no matter what i do.Its a Piece of garbage DON'T BY IT.(
1,it was not working,buy the disc of the game. the download did not work and i was so looking forward to playing it to.
1,Lost the charm. Hate the 3D,I hate this new 3D version of this game. The people look ridiculous and it's hard to navigate and understand
2,RCT to real time 3D graphics,"Por fin, la mejor version de RCT3 acaba de salir. Con esta edicion Platinum no solo se obtienen las ultimas expansiones y el juego original, sino ke tambien se corrigen ciertos bugs de ediciones anteriores y ke no eran tan completos como este."
3,"Great, but you need the right hardware for best experience.","If you don't have the right graphics, then you'll be spending more time waiting on the game than actually playing it. Best if your Windows Experience Index is at least a 4 or higher. The game takes a lot of graphics to keep it running smoothly. If your computer doesn't have the specs, don't waste your money. It's not really anything wrong with the game...I guess it's just older."
4,RC Tycoon 3 review,"This is a great game, because now you can create yourself, your friends, and vitually ride your rides using coaster cam. You can also switch the time of day from day to night, so you can see the rides with lights with laser shows and fireworks in the background. The disadvantages are that it takes a long time to install and load. Sometimes I have experienced short pauses or even stops in the game. Even with this drawback, I still love the game and would encourage anyone to purchase it."
3,Fun Park Sim with Limitations,I enjoy this game but it does have some limitations. The interface is a little lacking and building your own rollercoasters can be frustrating. You build all the way around and cannot get them to connect at both ends to join the loop. I wound up just using the pre built coasters and building a amusument park. The game is not nearly as complete as a Aim City game but it is entertaining.
3,RCT3<RCT2,"I gotts say RCT3 was good and all but im not a fan of the 3D feature with thing game. The first two to me are a lot more fun. Now don't get me wrong, this franchise is just the most exciting game and im not cutting down the 3rd. I just prefer the 2D more. Love the game"
3,flashy but clunky,"For all the added 3d effects and flashy look, I found this game very frustrating with no ""undo"" feature. Also, what happened to using the right button to get out of what you are building or what ever? With this game, you have to go back and press the same button again to get out of a mode. The pools are impossible to build, I found that the ramp to the pool complex I was building could never quite reach the ground and the lengths of ramp sections were not adjustable in length to fix the problem. Very frustrating. Also, I am tired of the ""grid"". Why can't we put things where we want? I also gave up on building water rides. Tycoon 2 was more enjoyable."
4,Fun for all ages!,"Purchased for my ten year old daughter who loves playing this game, but......Daddy must be reminded that it is her game. It is kind of like buying a train set for your son in the old days but you knew who it was for, yep...Daddy.What makes this game more fun is that you get to design your coaster, slide, show or whatever and then you get to experience them. How cool is it to ride on your custom coaster of various designs. I like adding my own soundtracks and really pumping up the volume.I would recomemnd this game for the casual user and the most creative person. I would recommend having it on more than one computer."
4,Good game and priced right,"If you liked the original then you might like this one. It has many of the familiar tools but is presented with a new interface. Be sure to invest some time in the tutorials to get the most out of this sandbox game. I note that changing land height is much harder to master and it may destroy existing and future walking paths, which appears to be a bug. You may ride the rides, which is great! It will run on just about any modern machine.Pros:Inexpensive - you'll get many hours of play for your moneyRide the coasters you buildWorks on most every modern PCCons:It's an older game so lower your graphical expectationsIt appears to have a few bugs with paths and elevation changesOverall: Worth it!"
5,Roller Coaster Tycoon,"My kids love this game. My 12 and 6 year old are constantly on my computer playing this game and then showing me the parks they made and 'taking me for rides' on what they created. The 12 year old asked for the updated version for Christmas, but he has all that was made. No newer versions."
5,Roller Coaster tycoon 3 platinum,"I purchased this game for my 8 yr.old son. He plays it for hours. The parks he builds are out of this world very user friendly for him. He is the biggest roller coaster fan in the world and this game really hits home for him. He did have the original roller coaster tycoon, so he has been a fan for quite some time."
4,Addictive game,Definitly a great game for being older and highly addictive. I reccomend you to try it out if you like designing things or building themeparks or just like rollercoasters.
5,HA ha ha.....,I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend. It is a fun little game that we both enjoy playing together!!! I am going to have to buy a copy for myself as I keep trying to take her laptop to play it.
1,Rollercoaster tycoon 3 platinum,I bought this game for my son. Unfortunatly he has not been able to play because there are compatibility issues with Windows Vista. I have tried the patches for this program and am still not able to get it to work for him. I'm very disappointed. I didn't even want to give it one star but this site would not let me save my comments otherwise.
1,waste of money,"i tried loading it and then unloading it 10 times download would not work,i will only buy games in dvd form downloads have probs.it was a waste of money .my son wife all tried to load .i have never had trouble before installing a game"
1,Didn't Work,"This download version simply did not install on my computer. Every time I attempted to install RCT3 Platinum, it would install about half-way, then I'd get an error message that a .cab file didn't match something in the directory or something like that, and then the installation would abort.This is the LAST time I ever try to purchase a downloadable game and this is also the LAST time I ever bother to buy something by Amazon."
3,Its ok,I bought this game hoping it would have decent graphics and would be fun to play. The game was not as good as I had expected. I'm not sure I would recommend it to a friend.
5,Best Game Ever,This game may be old but it is still THE BEST sandbox game out there. I played this game for the 1st time when I was 10. About 3 months ago I though about it and was pleased to see I could download it. i got my copy from Steam. IT IS STILL THE BEST GAME EVER. I pomise! You will LOVE this GAME.
1,Did not work on XP and there is no support out there.,Was really looking forward to playing this game but was extremely disapointed to learn that it would not work with XP due to copyright software that prevents the game from running. There is little to no support out there for these issues and further more I seemed to find lots of people experiencing the same frustrations. Do your research before buying older games!
5,"Very fun game, wish they'd make another!","I saw this game on my sidebar being advertised for $4.99 so i decided to check into it. I had played RCT before but I honestly didn't know that this one existed, so I purchased it (for 5 bucks how can you really go wrong) and I was very impressed!The graphics are pretty nice (blows the previous RCT games away anyway) and the gameplay is amazing. So many customization options, the ability to ride your rides in first-person, and the addition of the animals/waterparks really let your imagination run wild.I have installed this on 3 of my computers one running XP, one on 7 Home premium, and one on 7 Professional and haven't had any compatibility issues."
5,Kids Love It!,"""Vintage"" computer game....kids love it! All the animals and different types of game play keep the kids (and adults) buys and happy!"
4,Don't try it with Windows 7!,"I thought I would take a risk and try to run it with Windows 7 in Compatability mode, using Windows XP Service Pack 2 settings. It does not work. It states the platforms, and it is my fault for not heading the obvious. But, I thought I would put this on here incase anyone else had the same idea. I never got to see the game, but the music sounds good. LOL. I gave it 4 stars, because I have played Rollercoaster Tycoon 2, and it was a good game. I would expect this to be, as well."
3,A Lackluster Sequel,"I played Roller Coaster Tycoon 1 way back in the day, and decided to try this one out since it was available for download from Amazon. Although there was nothing altogether terrible about it, I can't say I was impressed. Aside from improved graphics and the addition of animals and a few new rides, I didn't feel like much had changed since the original.The user interface in this game is also quite frustrating. Even tasks like building paths seem to become much more complicated than they should be due to a lack of clear controls. Raising and lowering land is a bit of a nightmare and can't be done with much precision. The game in general is also a bit buggy, which makes it a bit of a pain, but altogether playable."
1,Worthless,"From first glance, the product appears great...different modes, nice backlit display, covers for the fork tips. However, when inserting into meat, it takes FOREVER to come up to temp. I've watched it go 85->87->90->92 and so on for probably 30 seconds to a minute before coming up to temp. The internal temp of the meat is probably changing as you leave the grill open waiting for it to read. Also, there isn't any indicator when it has come up to temp so you usually end up waiting to see if it is going to ""bump up"" anymore.Save your money and avoid this one."
2,It does not work very well,"I does not work very good, I tried to use it on a new grill ,and I could have guessed doneness better."
1,Worked for a month.......................?,"ditto on the review listed below. Additionally the product quit working 1 month into use. Thinking about trying to exchange, but I think I'll chalk this up to a waste of money, and buy a good product to replace this one.From first glance, the product appears great...different modes, nice backlit display, covers for the fork tips.

3,Imagine remembering everything you ever read about psychology and then discounting it all in one book...,"Hillman is a walking library so it ihard for him to make simple declarative sentences. He regurgitates everything he ever learned about the science and then discounts all of it and comes up with a declarative sentence when he deals with dreams and psychology: 'stay with the image' That's really all I needed to know and it was profound, because I've tended to interpret everything from dreams to daily life with all its people, thoughts and actions. So the book served to both destroy a few billion brain cells through overwork in trying to keep up with his ADD narrative,, and opened a door to a new chapter in my personal life. Not a bad trade."
3,Ok,"While the book provided a good overall reference of Solaris, dealing with alot of books that don't touch on subjects like IPV6, NIS+, and proc . This book did. The title is decieving . It doesn't cover much of the new specific features of Solaris 8 other then IPv6. Even then it is underwhelming."
3,OK to Good,"This was a pretty good book for covering Solaris - in general, not Solaris 8. I bought it becuase I just got my hands on a new Ultra5. As an NT dood with just a little Linux experience, this helped a lot when dealing with sendmail (though just enough to get started) qpopper, process management, drive management, run-level management, and other goodies. It's definitely not thurough, but good enoug to keep around. If it didn't say 'The Complete Reference' I would have given it 4 stars. Don't get me wrong, it's pretty decent; it touches a lot of things pretty well, but definitely not deep and broad enough to be called ""The Complete Reference.'"
2,"Okay book, better for beginners","This is an okay reference. Fairly simplified and missing any mention of some of 8's newer features, such as RBAC's. Hardly complete at all."
2,Solaris 8 - Incomplete Reference,"This may be better called ""Solaris 8 - Incomplete Reference"". Don't even use it alone trying to pass Sun's Certification. The index is particularly useless."
1,My Book Also Fell apart!!!,This book is a waste of money! I had the book for two days and the spine fell apart causing the pages to fall out (unfortunately they didn't blow away in the wind). The book is useless the examples in the book regarding samba and apache aren't even suited as a intro. The authors should have left both chapters out! The rest of the book gives brief descriptions of useful applications and commands.... but in no way is it a complete reference as the title states. Do yourself a favor and get Sobells Guide to Solaris (for this is truely a complete reference)! Last thing to mention the book does not mention any of the new aspects of solaris8 ... the cover could just as easily say solaris7 or linux instead of solaris8!
2,Waste of time and money,I come from Windows NT and read some other Solaris materials but this book didn't help me in understanding the OS as I expected it too. It generalize major topics and lacks good examples. I find it a waste of time reading this book.
2,Nothing about Solaris 8,"This book makes a fine general Solaris reference. It lacks though concrete concepts about Solaris 8. Like SEAM, and RBAC. It has no disucussion of ASET. Or any of the other new features that make Solaris 8 so exciting.WHat is good about it? It provides a fine general reference for Solaris. Has a good section on proc, and is one of the books which spends anytime going over Samba, and Netalk. If only VERY breifly."
2,"The Incomplete ""Complete Reference""","I probably wouldn't have been as disappointed as I am with the book if it had been titled properly. It is anything but complete.If you have money to blow, buy it to add to your references if studying for the certifications, but frankly it is far from a reference. I just hope I can remember what topics it does address well. Those that it does address in ernest are well written and readablably understandable to the newbie, which I did appreciate, but I stopped carrying it to class as a supplement because it seldom has anything I need (or maybe its just that the index [stinks]...?)."
2,The Profoundly Incomplete Reference,"This is a book may be OK for very, very basic use of Solaris, but otherwise it's almost absurdly incomplete. And the index is completely useless.Too much history and concept (of UNIX, of Sun, of FTP, of DHCP) but not NEARLY enough detail about the real-world configuration and administration of the OS. I personally did not find any help with the issues/scenarios I regularly encounter...The online AnswerBook is easier and better - plus it's free!"
2,One of those books with a lot of fluff but not enough detail,"This book is too basic and is full of empty fluff. You get to learn how to interactively install Solaris, with full pages of graphics showing windows and whatnot, just like a Microsloth book. You also get to learn how to use CDE, which makes sense for an aspiring Unix admin, right? No. It also contains full printouts that are utterly useless -- like the /dev directory, which fills up about 5 pages. It's really embarrassing. Further, it uses a very large font. I'm not accusing the authors of trying to cheat the buyer, but I will say that the book is far from ""Complete"" and in fact contains very little actual information. Where the information provided begins to look interesting, it cuts off at the point where you'd want to know more details..."
2,Incomplete Reference,"I purchased this book to assist me in the reconfiguration of a Sun UltraSparc 250 that had been removed from service. I want to set it up to be a static DNS server for reverse lookups. This book has not been very good at assisting. Many of the web references for example files are invalid. Over all, this book is good for the basics, but not enough to raise the experience level up much."
2,no example problems,The contents of the chapters do not prepare you for the practice problems at the end. There are no example problems within the chapter.
4,Parallel is the way to go,A pleasant read but I think the Wilkenson and Allen book called Parallel Computing is better written. All in all it wasn't bad and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a secondary source.
2,A misleading title,"The title of this book is misleading.This book claims to be about networking customized for embedded systems. However, there is not much here, which is specific for emebedded systems. This is more like a book, about application layer protcols."
3,"Probably A ""Doom Tree"" Stories-Set:)","While admittedly I haven't actually viewed this at all, just seeing its cover-picture (including the ""two new enemies"" flanking Sailor Moon:) helps me figure that it's a collection of stories regarding The Doom Tree and the two young aliens who come with it, (English names) Allen and Anne. From what I remember of the (probably edited;) American-TV cartoons, these stories are pretty good. Very cool art-treatment of the mysterious & dangerous Doom Tree ('course, naturally that'd interest me, as I'm a graphic-artist myself:)."
4,Very Good Summary,This book provides a great study guide for the CPM exam. The book is divided into the 4 sections of the exam which allows you to focus on the necessary material. It also includes a CD with lots of sample exam questions you can use to practice.
2,Did not find the book useful for CPM exam preparation,"I purchased this book hoping to cover several aspects of the CPM exam. I read the first 10 chapters then ordered CPM's 2 exam test books. I could hardly get 56 out of 75 (CPM's passing score), while solving the questions of the book chapters I could get 8-9/10. The reasons is the questions asked in the exam test has no ground of explanation in the book. Reading this book to pass the exam is almost impossible, at least for me. The book gives good general overview about purchasing but it will not help you to pass the exam.I do have several years of purchasing experience, but in many situations the correct answer has nothing to do with logic or what you usually do in your daily purchasing process and the book fails to explain or provide information about ISM-CPM's way of explaning things."
2,supplemental tool ONLY,"I only bought this book to help pass Module 4. My company sent me for classes and provided study materials to assist with the first 3 modules, but then I switched jobs. Since my new company would not pay for my last exam or the study materials, I was trying to find a reasonably priced resource to help pass my last module. This book was reasonably priced, but not helpful. It provides a very light, abbreviated outline of what is covered on the exam. There were some related topics, but nothing as detailed as what I was used to reading. I would save your money and put it toward a study guide that is a little more in depth."
5,A Treasured Gift,"Last year Bob Moore's book, Trailer Trash, was given to me as a birthday present. It was the perfect gift! First of all, I know and love the southwest part of our country. Secondly, it took me back to my childhood of the 50's and to my grandparents trailer home. I remembered the toilet with the rushing water that was so loud I was sure that the whole world knew I had just gone to the bathroom. It brought back the closeness of the cramped trailer quarters of the 50's and a smell I would recognize anywhere. As has been said hundreds of times, Bob, ""thanks for the memories."""
5,Fun and informative.,"As a long time fan of the desert southwest's timeless icons I say ""hats off"" to Bob Moore and his book Trailer Trash. I have traveled much of this region and am certain I've seen some of the examples in Mr. Moore's book firsthand but lacked the camera to capture the shot. The vintage trailer advertisements balanced the images with what they once were. I have many friends who are going to enjoy my gift to them in this book."
2,Not what the cover leads you to believe ...,While the cover title and photo would suggest this is a humorous tome of photo's on travel trailers it is more a book on mobile homes of the 1950's ... the documentation of advertising of the mobile homes of the 50's is excellant however the photos are images of derelict and abandoned mobile homes which leave little to warm the heart of the reader ...
5,GFR rocks on!!!,"Compared to an old cassette of ""The Best of Grand Funk Railroad,"" the sound of the digitally re-mastered recordings are no comparison. They are smokin'!!! The added bonus of the DVD just enhances enjoyment of some good old-time rock-n-roll!"
2,Where's Todd?,"The music portion is ok..pretty much what I expected tho I would have liked to have heard their version of ""Gimme Shelter"".I remember seeing that American Band short in the movie theatre and I swear Todd Rundgren, producer of the album...made an extremely brief appearance in the film. Couldn't find him anywhere.Is it me or were those shots of Mark Farner riding his horse look a lot like Anthony Kiedis in one of the Chili Peppers videos.Farner should have kept the hair long and forgotten about that horrible mullet he now sports."
5,a good sturdy walking stick,"When I was looking at walking sticks, knew that I wanted to get a wooden one. The Brazos freeform hickory stick is very good looking and sturdy enough to handle anything you might come across while hiking.It was a little long for me. But, was able to cut it to length without any problems.If you are looking for a traditional wood hiking stick, this is a good one to consider."
4,Walking Stick,It worked so well I no longer need it and passed it on to a person who would benefit from it with instructions to pass it on when she no longer needs it.
5,A solid hiking stick...,This is a beautifully made walking/hiking stick that feels solid in the hand and has very nice weight to it. I would feel safe using it to defend myself if need be.
4,walking stick,"I used the walking-stick for a 3-mile (5K) run/walk for organ, tissue and eye transplants. I have unspecified pain in my hip and leg, and the stick helped take the weight off the affected leg. It is a handsome hickory stick. What I would have loved, however, would have been a cleft at the top to use as a thumb-rest, but I saw none on the Brazos website.The package arrived damaged, likewise the stick inside, but the company could not have been more helpful in getting me a replacement stick in good time for the walk."
5,Really excellent,This was purchased as a gift and was as beautiful and functional as described and a delight to give.
5,Walking stick,my son loved the natural wooden walking stick with leather handle strap and solid bottom to prevent slipping while hiking. Good choice
3,Bonus material problems,"Got this set yesterday ... I know I will enjoy the films, as I have seen them all before. However, I have been having problems with the bonus materials in the Frankenstein set, many of which seem to crash the DVD. This is disappointing, as the bonus features were a large part of why I bought the set."
1,Universal disappoints again.....,"They should skip the figurines and put their efforts into creating better transfers with less compression. These films don't look or sound as good as they could or should, and that's a shame to all the loyal fans of classic Universal horror.Thumbs down. Way down!"
1,poor product quality,"After waiting two months for this item, imagine my disappointment that the Werewolf of London disk was full of pixalations and drop outs! I talked to my brother, who also got a set, & he said his Frankenstein disk wouldn't play. When he examined the disk, and said that it was full of deep scratches and looked like someone used it for a hocky puck.I read the reviews of others and it appears that Universal really goofed on this one. They also cut corners by making double sided disks, which are prone to damage.Amazon has promised to replace my set--but geez, how many sets do I have to sit and watch to find the bad disks? Quality control isn't my job. Universal has created an inferior product all dressed up in a fancy package. They should have saved some money on the slick packaging and painted busts and made a product wasn't defective and that you could actually watch all the way through.Buyer beware. It took all the fun out of it for me!"
3,Poor product manufacturing!!,"I have been waiting since late February when I first heard this was being released, my husband pre-ordered it as a birthday gift for me. I got it 4/29/04 and my Wolfman bonus disc is ALL SCRATCHED UP! It looks like something is streaked across it back and forth, like a glue or something but it will not come off AND WON'T PLAY!! I am VERY dissapointed after waiting so long for this! Needless to say it will be exchanged but the experience was ruined and has left a bad taste in my mouth! Now I have to go through the hell which is exchanging something through the mail!! Arrrghhh!!!"
3,Quality Control Issues,"I also had the same problem as a previous reviewer. I bought 2 sets (not from Amazon) and had severe scratches on several of the DVDs. I brought them back to the store and had to open 4 other packages in the return counter until I found 2 packages that I was happy with.Other than that, this is an incredible DVD set."
3,The ULTIMATE collection?,"I reserved my copy from Amazon in early March, as of 4/30/04 my box set still did not ship. Yet, another reviewer claims he ordered his on 4/5/04 and recieved it the very next day after it was released? What gives Amazon?Cancelled the order, bought it at Best Buy for $4.00 more than what Amazon was asking for it.Nice set but the film transfers appear to be the same as the original issues.Everyone knows how good the movies are, so no need to review them.The DVD boxes are very nice with a cool protective sleeve.The statues are not up to Sideshow Toys high standards though. A nice touch to include in the set, but the likeness of the actors is way off.Overall though, it's a good deal."
5,All of my favorite childhood Monsters!,"I just received this boxed collection today, and I was really pleased with everything! This is such a great value, and if you're like me and have always wanted these movies in your own collection, then this is the one to get!! Each Monster has his own separate DVD Case containing several movies pertaining to each one. I couldn't believe how nice this whole gift set was put together, and the ""bust"" of each Monster was done really nice. I am so...pleased to finally have all of my favorites to enjoy and share whenever I please. You must own this set, and get prepared for the Van Helzing movie opening soon!!"
2,"Damn You, Universal!!!","I ordered this dvd on Oct. 22nd and it came on Nov. 1st. All of the dvds work with the exception of the Dracula disc two, it only plays on 1 of the 3 dvd players that I have. I hope Universal doesn't want to get into a lawsuit. I might return it here i might just go to target. I think the dvd was loose is because it was packaged in newspapers, not packing beans. I wish the Laemmles hadn't sold the studio in 1936, things would have been much different."
1,Thank you,Thank you to all for your reviews and warnings. I won't be purchasing this set.What a shame :(
3,Is it Closed Captioned?,"I'm a horror movie buff...Is this Closed Captioned? If so, I'm definitely gonna buy it. Anybody out here please let me know! Thanks!"
5,Finally Its out...,"To all Horror Movie fans like myself, I first bought all these movies on VHS format back in the early 80's after seeing them in my youth..I am so glad to be part of this release..I loved these then and love them even more now..I happen to be a fan of alot of unusual movies and this is a must for my library. My next addition is to add Vincent Price's masterpiece House of Wax and the much anticipated ""The Tingler""...I would love to keep in touch with other ppl who enjoy my type of movie.."
2,Problems playing the movies too!,"As the other reviewers have noted, these discs have problems playing. I would get halfway through the movie and it would freeze in the same spot everytime. It really is a shame since I have been wanting to see these movies for over 25 years, after only having read about them in old movie magazines. Good movies but incredibly bad production with the high amount of sets being reported as defective."
2,Quality control?,"Being one of the original ""Monster Kids"", I have been eager for this set. So eager in fact that I bought it @ a ""brick and mortar"" establishment so I wouldn't have to wait. Here's the bad news. I bought the set, opened it and found one of the discs unattached to its spindle and scratched. I returned it to the store and swapped it out. More bad news. The second set had TWO loose discs (also scratched). I opened the third set in the store and found that it was MISSING one of the discs! I decided to give it one last shot, so customer service allowed me to open a fourth set. You guessed it: two more loose and scratched discs! Universal apparently has some serious quality control issues. I gave this set two stars only becasue of the concept of the packaging w/ the little busts. I really hated walking out of that store empty handed."
1,Hmmm.....,That's funny I just saw the last review and the same thing happened to my set. I ordered it and crossed my fingers but the only one that was messed up was the dracula disc. It was dislogged from it's incasement and was just brutally scratched. Looked like someone took the DVD and just put it on their shoes and skipped around all day. I wasn't sure if I should have ruturned the whole set because that was the only one. But why can't they just get it right and make those DVD's secure for transportation? If anything their probably getting more returns then sales. I really think the collection is cool but man if you could just get one that works. I am awaiting my second replacement now and we shall see....
2,Bad Disk,I have read some of the reviews that complain about the quality and sound of the disks but the biggest problem I am having is trying to get a replacement for the second Frankenstein disk. That disk was loose in the case and was badly scratched.I received the original disks on May 6 and Amazon said the replacement will be delivered on the 12th. By the 14th and still no disks I contacted Amazon. They said the set was in short supply and would ship the replacement between May 25 and June 2.I wanted to just return the Frankenstein set but they said no you have to send the whole thing back. I wonder what my odds are to get all 6 disks in good condition? Overall I think this set is a good value but the problem with scratched disks and the long delays in getting a replacement makes me wonder.
1,Unreal,"Why, oh why did I not listen to the reviews. I couldn't tell you how the transfers look...the DVD were toast upon arrival! Yes, it's true...all true. I got the box and before I even opened the wrapper I heard the DVDs were loose in their cases and guess what? Ruined! Totally scratched and useless. Please believe me, don't waste your time."
4,Bevare! Bevare! Dracula is suspect here!,"When I bought my set I went to my local retailer and they had a stack of them. I picked up one and rotated the box and heard loose discs clunking around. The second box I tried didn't make a sound so I figured all of the discs were in their holders and that's the one I bought and so far no problems. But I'm afraid Universal goofed in mastering Dracula. If you watch the movie with the commentary track the person notes that the previously censored groans when Dracula gets a stake through his heart have been restored and you can hear them in the commentary track. However, if you watch the movie without the commentary you have a very noisy soundtrack and the death groans are still absent! I read another review for the previous single Dracula DVD and they said the soundtrack was correct and the image was better too. Bevare! Bevare!"
3,Rascal,"Arrived on time, Package was not secured too well. Top of book was somewhat frayed as a result. Also, I thought the book would have original artwork from the old Rascal book but it was a new edition. All in all, it's fine because I just wanted the book."
2,Bad main base charger (happened twice),"The phone has some great features, I just wish that it worked properly. The main base charger stopped charging after a few weeks. Nothing I did could help it. I exchanged it for another thinking this was a freak problem. After a few weeks the same thing happened to the new phone. Now I'm temporarily swapping the batteries between handsets every couple of days just to keep the main phone charged. I just looked at some reviews online at epinions.com and all 3 reviews had the same problem. I just wish I saw them before now."
2,Poor phone....,"Like others, wish I read the reviews BEFORE buying! Base phone quit working in less than 6 months, replaced battery, no good....then exchanged it, worked fine for a little while, then quit...again. Now, without a base phone AGAIN! Also, can only listen to messages while at base (not accessable through phones)....very annoying. Do not think I will purchase Vtech POOR QUALITY phones again....and the price wasn't that good either."
3,Decent Game?,"This Game is okay, it has elements of Strategy and Real time Action, but it is not as well developed as it could have been. The technology is a good two years behind where the industry is today. If you like real time action games, this one is for you. If you like Xcom or other games like that this one is okay. There is little difference between the weapons and equipment, so the strategy part of the game suffers signifigantly, but there is alot of gameplay for the buck. On The regular and Hard settings there are literally a hundred missions to play or so before you get through the game. With each mission lasting from fifteen to thirty minutes, this game will keep you playing for a long time. The big question is will it keep you interested. The Price is coming down to the range where you can take a chance on it if you have liked other games in the Genre. It's not bad. It's not great. It's just an average title."
2,Didn't work for me.,"I bought this item to work on my moderate acne, and to help clear up dark spots on my face. I was unable to give the soap time to see if the spots would clear because is was so very drying. It actually made my existing acne worse, and dried out my face considerably.It may work for you if you are prepared to get a lot worse before getting better. The owner called and offered to send me some Shea Butter for my troubles (which I thought was very nice, and excellent customer service) but it never arrived."
2,Strange consistancy for a soap.,"This soap has no noticable scent, which is a good thing to me. However it seems to crumble and fall apart easy with very little pressure -- just the minor pressure one uses to hold onto the bar itself. It does clean ones skin well. It is rather expensive for what one gets. I doubt I will be buying this again."
4,solid effort,Drinking with a girl should be in everyones jukebox. An upbeat elliott smith but not as hip hoppy as J MRAZ . I saw him open for j mraz last year in Santa Barbaa and really enjoyed him. You need to see him live than the cd will just knock your scoks off.
5,Lost for Words...,"Amazing legal work done by Bernies Legal Team including John. It just baffles me that this happened in the court system, a system that we trust. I am still in awe."
4,Extremely interesting,"This will be a fascinating book to anyone living in, or near Chicago, and who like me, is interested in the history that is all around us. There is so much of this history in the street names - people, places, stories, changing geography etc. I recommend this to any curious person."
4,out of print and hard to find,my brother in law has been looking for this out of print book for a long time. It arrived promptly and in good shape
2,"Disappointing, the title is deceiving","Since the book is described as a history of Chicago street names, I expected the book to not only tell me how the present day streets received their name, but their previous name and when and why it was changed. Just one example, Burley Ave. was once known as Ontario, but the book doesn't give any mention to this fact."
1,Worse than useless for obsolete street names,"If the book made no attempt to list street name changes, that would be one thing. But when it lists street name changes and leaves many out (I'll add the change of Jackson to Maryland to the example cited in an earlier review.), then it is worse than useless. It gives the false impression of being comprehensive, so that the absence of a name change from the list might be taken as evidence that there was no name change, when in fact the list is not at all comprehensive and omits many street name changes. I was very disappointed in this book."
5,alexandria review,"These guys are son volt, dylan, and doc watson rolled up into one country groove. Definitely check them out."
4,Sturdy Power Amp (With a trusted Name) at a Decent Price,"I bought this power amp about 5 months ago to power 2 Tapco 12"" Speaker Cabs I run Vocals with in my garage and for shows. Its been a very reliable amp so far, and it has a pretty good amount of power for pushing vocals, bass, or just playing music. As far as features, it is pretty cut and dry, and doesnt have a whole lot of extras. The only thing I can say against it is its noise handling. I found, in a noisy garage with 3 mics, the clipping light was going off frequently. Then again, in a noisy garage, you can tell much difference when sound starts to distort, but when just playing music through it, its got pretty good clarity.For lighter use, and most 2 speaker set ups, this amp is great and affordableNOTE: I havent tried it out with a sub, so I dont know how well it responds to bass, and if there is any frequency loss. Might be a good idea to research if interested."
4,Solid,"These Crown amplifiers are now made in China, but the construction is beefy and surprisingly elegant. Apparently, all of the XLS amps share a substantial power supply with a huge toroidal transformer. These are large, heavy, and well-made amps. The XLS 202 weighs about twice as much as the Pyle Pro amp I purchased previously from Amazon. Although the Pyle amp works fine for sound reinforcement, I believe the XLS 202's performance is closer to a ""hi-fi"" audio amp. The exclusive use of XLR connectors for the inputs is a little inconvenient but that's about the only complaint I can muster. I should also mention that I ordered this amp on Sunday afternoon, October 3rd, and it was delivered on Tuesday afternoon, October 5th. Amazing."
4,A welcome revisit and revision of his earlier songs,"This won't set the world on fire, but it's great to hear these Squeeze songs re-imagined as acoustic country/americana staples. Chris has great taste, and the set nevers veers into maudlin. If you are a Squeeze fan and are ready for a bit of an adventure, then I recommend it. After all these years, you don't trust him?"
2,Boring...,"Having recently watched Glen Tilbrook both live and on his DVD ""One for the road"" I purchased the Chris Difford CD/DVD package and its so slow and low key and from time to time downright boring. I haven't even watched the DVD yet but if it's similar to the CD it'll be hard staying awake. Sorry......"
1,junky,"My fiancee received this exact DVD player for Christmas. We have used it pretty regularly on the weekends since Christmas. After watching 2 dvds in one day, we tried to watch a third but kept getting the error message that ""no disc is being detected"". My fiancee called RCA and after waiting on hold for a half hour to talk to a customer service representative, they informed him that if he put out 50$, it would be fixed. I told him he might as well just buy another dvd player. I hope if anybody buys this make and model of dvd player, the same problem does not happen to you."
2,Bad picture and bad audio sync,"This player tries to do Progressive Scan, but has jerky video playback. Not only that, but it has very bad audio sync. It's usually off by about 1/4 sec, and even worse right after a layer change."
1,THis SUCKS! dont pay even 2 dollars for this....,I got this Dvd PLayer AnD AFTER playing it for 2 months it quit on me..i had to pay 50 dollars to get it fixed...After that i said no more RCA for me. I hope no one else ever has to go through with this RCA product again.!from an angry buyer...lol
1,don't even pay $5 for this loser,"OK I bought mine for $69 at Christmas, it quit playing entirely after 6 months. The warranty is only for 2 months. After that you pay shipping plus $50 for a refurbished unit. I have an RCA tv that has been in the shop 3 times, so this means NO MORE RCA."
4,"So far, so good","My fog lights haven't been busted by gravel yet. I'd say considering the price of Hellas, you'd be remiss to not spend the extra to insure them."
3,"Short, simple quick overview","A slim book, it nevertheless contains a very useful overview of the types of edged weapons found in Africa (with the exception of the north African Arab countries. If you are just starting out collecting these weapons or have a cursory interest, this is a good book to start."
2,Overblown and dated,this book gives us scant information new or otherwise and the pictures are of a first graders variety. Perhaps there is nothing else out there but I certainly cant recommend this.
3,A few fresh ideas,"Mindy Ganz Ribner's book is definitely geared to first time cooks, so much so that her writing style often feels condescending. She begins her book with a primer for setting up the kosher kitchen. Her tips and suggestions are both clear and helpful. She includes lists of cooking equipment and suggests which ones are needed for which areas of kosher cooking (meat, dairy or parve [neutral]). This introduction makes this book a good gift item for a young bride or a beginning cook with no on-hands knowledge of the laws of keeping kosher.This is a big book, with over 400 pages and 300 recipes. The recipes are for the most part original and easy to follow. It is her cutesy writing style and habit of giving nick names to so many of her recipes that I found to be a turn off. A few of the cookie recipes I tried were flops and I found the cakes to be more fussy than the end result called for. Overall this is an okay book but not the best of the lot."
2,problems with flow control knob,"I've used this unit for several months and dozens of times and have had good results with the exception of the material adjustment knob. Like other reviewers I too have had trouble threading it after cleaning, and once attached, there have been times I've been unable to turn it without the use of pliers. Given how frequently you use this knob it is really frustrating and a pain in the neck...I would not purchase this gun again."
2,Campbell Hausfeld HV3500 Fine Finish HVLP Paint Sprayer,"It does a good job of covering the surface with paint after appropriate thinning, but the low capacity of the container forces you to refill frequently. You must cover EVERYTHING when using this to paint a room. It creates a fine dry powder overspray that will land in places you didn't think about covering. Overall, I would have been better off with a roller and brushes."
5,An outstanding review of Emerson,"If you want to read any book about Emerson, this is the one you should read. Geldard does an exceptional job of not only describing and discussing Emerson's work, but he is able to dig deeply into some of Emerson's more esoteric and poetic philosophy and point out some of the highlights in terms that are real and understandable."
3,Not What I Expected,I was looking for a collection of Emerson's spiritual writings. This is more of the author talking about Emerson's spiritual writings. Not what I was looking for.
4,What an inspiration,"Emmerson can be difficult to read in his original text, so I really appreciated Geldard breaking it down for me in a style that sort of translates Emmersons style for me. After reading this I now can read Emmerson on my own and get much more out of it.Emmerson is truely one of my heros and I am grateful for this book to bring even more of his philospy to me and those I share it with!"
2,Very small book with snippets of trivia,"I should have paid more attention to the product description and noted how many (or few) pages were in this book. I thought perhaps it might be a fascinating in-depth study of the Paris subway system, similar to Chrisian Wolmar's excellent ""The Subterranean Railway"" (about the London underground). I was wrong. It's a very thin hardback in which the author gives short (usually 1 paragraph) stories of how each Metro station got its name. The book is organized by the numbers of the subway lines, and contains some nice color photos (but there could have been much greater variety). I learned some interesting facts about the people and places who have been immortalized in the Metro, but I expected a lot more. No history of the Metro itself, and many stories that could have been fleshed out in more detail. This could easily have been an extra chapter stuck at the back of a Rick Steves travel guide, rather than a separate book."
1,Vantec NexStar 3 NST-360SU-BL 3.5-Inch SATA to USB 2.0 and eSATA External Hard Drive Enclosure,"There isn't much to say about this product other than that it's been an absolute disappointment. In my experience, actual detection of the Vantec NexStar 3 HDD Enclosure by my windows computer, was sporadic and only lasted a few days. Then it's been downhill ever since. I have tried a couple of things, including tweaking the antivirus software on my PC and also tried connecting the device to a windows Vista PC, then a windows 7 PC; and still no luck. I must say some of the previous reviews did mention this flaw. So far, the manufacturer's website has no new drivers to work with....buyer beware!"
2,Hot item: Vantec Nexstar3 3.5 Enclosure USB 2.0 blue,"I bought this enclosure and had some difficulty folding the parallel cable tight enough to allow the cover to close. Also, the enclosure came with the LED cable detached, so I had to carefully look at the very dark photo to see how it should be attached. After getting it going I noticed that in a horizontal orientation, it ran extremely hot. In a vertical orientation it ran hotter than is good for longevity of the drive and electronics. Within 24 hours, the LED burned out. The case is very slippery on most surfaces, creating the possibility of the device falling off one's desk. Drilling some vent holes in the metal case could help with the overheating problem. Overall, the design and quality control are below acceptable, but the appearance is good.Donald Gudehus"
1,Beauty is Only skin deep,"The case is attractive however, the benefits of this case ends there. I expected better from Vantec. I purchased the case to serve as my backup drive to backup my Windows Home Server drive which has reliability issues. The first problem is no fan, second problem is that the eSata functionality doesn't work when used with Sata I controllers. I tried two different machines with Sata I (150 MBs) and the system would not recognize the drive. One (intel controller) saw the drive but the system hung when trying to format the drive so this thing is useless to me. I already had a USB case (with fan) that cost me $13.00. I will be returning this one."
1,Its ok,Its no different then a super nintendo controller. It wasnt a big WOW to me. Its compact size though is great. It brought back memories to me when i had a super nintendo.JOHN SMITH
4,best in horrorpunk,"this cd is great. while the mixing is a bit lacking the songs make up for it. each song on this cd is very good and is different from the last. some people have claimed that blitzkid rip off the misfits. in the early days, yes a little bit, but with this cd i dont see where people get it. yes in any horror rock you will see a bit of the misfits. but when you listen to the misfits and blitzkid together other then the subject matter there not the same at all. blitzkid owns the horror rock scene now. if you disagree, find a better band?"
2,Meh,"The cd isnt very good :( when i think horror punk i think misfits or balzac or like danzig but this is just odd, though i highly enjoyed the song Lupen Tooth, i dunno, i suggest getting Lupen Tooth otherwise, meh"
2,"hmm, i don't like it.","I don't know why, i just don't like Blitzkid's sound. it just feels like they are trying too hard to fit into a niche. I think, if you are going to copy The Misfits, which is okay, copy Danzig. Blitzkid feels like they are copying Graves era stuff and if thats what you want, pass this up and buy Graves' new album ""Punk Rock Is Dead""."
5,Thought Provoking,"I lived in Germany when the Wall came down. I lived in Frankfurt for 4 years as an American and businessman. This account told me of events that I had not been aware of and should have been aware of. Ruth quite often enters into a philosophical view of events of the time and these views are so apropos today as we witness a move toward Socialism in the US, continued problems in the Middle East, a resurgence of Communism, endless and fruitless UN ""talks"", etc. It reminds me of a quote from Harry Truman's biography...""There is nothing new in the world. It is all in the history books."" Ruth's writings will make you think about the world. She tells the story from the view of a German....a view we Americans are often devoid of."
1,tastes powdery,was very excited to try this for thansgiving based on other reviews. i was very disappointed. i love spicy n'awlins cuisine but this did not deliver. it tasted powdery and the mixture of spices overwhelmed the flavor of anything you put it on. i would have been better off adding a simple roux to the drippings and spicing it up myself with some cajun or old bay. honestly any other gravy even out of a jar tastes better.
2,Book Review,Does not go into a lot of detail. Reads as if you already know what you are trying to accomplish.Would not recommend this book for the person with a young horse just starting out or if you are into Western Riding. I did get some pointers but not what I was looking for.
4,book Review,"This is a great book for teaching and training younger horses. It gives step-by-step information, and what to do if something goes wrong. Must have for any breeder!"
5,Unique collection of little-known corridos of the Mexican Revolution,"Great recopilation of corridos about the Mexican Revolution, old recordings brought back to life, including one from 1904, prior to the revolution. Excellent material for us at [...]"
3,Blaming Big Chuck,"Many people blame Big Chuck for loosing film and video tape of the Ghoulardi show. The fact is that in the early sixties, video tape and film were very expensive, and there was no budget at the time for archiving tape or film. All of the Parma Place episodes were video taped on old quad machines that no longer exist. Some video tape still exists that has not been restored,and many people have audio recordings of the ""KING"" that they do not want to part with. So ""HANG IN THERE GROUP"", the remaining Ghoulardi material is ""Ova Deh"", just this side of Parma!"
5,Cool it with the Boom Booms,"What can I say, except that Ernie Anderson is a legend in broadcasting. Back when local television stations produced more than the local news (Barnaby, Captain Penny, Dorothy), Ghoulardi was cutting edge humor. Cleveland was that much more a special town to grow up in because of the folks at Channel 8. A wonderful, non-PC age, where the diversity of Cleveland became fertile ground for Ernie's creative humor. Too bad due to 'correctness' we've lost the ability to make fun of ourselves.There's good reason that Cleveland is both the home of Rock and Roll and the home of Ghoulardi."
4,Great,My 4 year old daughter loves that she can swallow these like a big girl. She tried chewing them once but didn't like the flavor. A great easy was to get DHA into your kids.
4,"The taste is very fragrant,","The taste is very fragrant, the baby is like a day, eat a few grains! ! !&#65292;I like it!!!very good"
5,One of the great books of Christian piety.,"Author Peter Ackroyd (The Life of Thomas More) says that Hitlton's ""Scale of Perfection"" and Kempas'""Imitation of Christ"" are part of the broad tradition of late medieval Christian piety. Both books played a central part of Thomas More's life. Scale of Perfection is concerend with the active Chrictian life in the world. Hilton also wrote a volume entitled ""The Mixed Life."""
3,Designed for underwater camera case,"OK product. But don't be confused by the size, real size for one pack is:2.4 x 0.9 x 0.1 inches. You can find better price for similar product."
1,Ripped off,Ripped off by ANT Online. I ordered the Large Silicon Packs and got the Small Silicon Packs. Beware ....
2,Too small to be useful.,I wish I had read the review above. This product is very very small. Can't be more than 5 grams per silica pouch. This would only be useful for keeping a change purse dry. Too small to be of any use.
1,Silica Gel - Regeneration,"Yes, Olympus prices their silica gel to the moon. I have found packets of it packed with many products and will use these rather than spend the money for the Olympus product.Before I reuse a packet I regenerate it in a *prewarmed* oven set to 250F. Small packets should be fully dry in two hours. Just be sure to prewarm the oven so the packet is not overheated. Overheating could harm the packet itself."
3,"Necessary product for the camera, but too expensive","Actually I have a Casio camera and the underwater case and could not find anywhere spare parts (silica) for my case, so I found the Olympus one, which fits well to the Casio case. The only issue is that this is a quite expensive product. It is just silica, which comes from free in most products and Adorama has charged it as it was gold."
1,Not Enough About New Orleans,"This game doesn't have much to do with New Orleans. References to the city are limited to a few postage stamp sized photos on the board. Most disappointing to me, the locations of the references on the board bear no resemblance to the actual geographic locations of the sites mentioned. I had to rush out and find another gift for my New Orleans buff after this arrived."
1,This is CRAP!!!!,First time I used this set two of the socket wrenches broke. Save your money and buy something that works!
5,Top Quality Car Mats,"These mats are sturdy, durable, attractive and an excellent investment.They arrived on time and I couldn't be more pleased with the quality.I searched the web for the best and I found these mats to be just that."
3,"Rear mats are great, but Front mats needed lots of modification",I had to cut a lot of the material to get the front mats to fit and they still do not fit perfectly. I drive a 1994 buick skylark.
2,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed. They were the same price as the best floor mats at Walmart in a far less quality. I should have just purchased at Walmart and had them the same day, then pay the same for worse quality. Shipping was not too slow. My biggest disappointment was the quality. I now do not trust the product descriptions from this seller."
3,Not that good of the quality,Not as good of quality as you would expect for the price listed and paid
5,awsome,"this is an awsome product i've really enjoyed it. i would recommend for you to buy them it holds everything.spilt drinks, sand, mud, rocks etc"
4,It does the job it's suppose too.,I really do not have any complaints with this product. It looks great in my car and it doesn't smell as bad as some here stated. The reason I marked this to 4 stars is because it did slip at a least once on the driver's side and I didn't like that I had to adjust the mat but the adjustment wasn't too bad and it has only happened once so far.
4,good mats,these appear to be good quality mats that mold well to the inside of my car. the thickness is about right and they look durable. I do not detect any rubber smell as was mentioned by other reviews.
2,Slippery Mats,The things on the back of the car mat are too short and don't hold. I'm always adjusting the floor mats.
4,Good Value,Although they are not as deep as the ones i had prior i think they will work just fine. It was a good value for the price.
5,fit 2012 RAV 4...no smell ;-),"These mats fit my 2012 RAV 4 without any trimming. These floor mats contain no rubber, which is good because I am allergic to rubber latex. I had to literally put my nose on these mats to smell them to see if they were really rubber free. The mats did have a have a slight ""plastic"" smell when I did that, and to grade the smell as slight is very good. (Think ""canary in a mine shaft"" that is sensitivity of my sense of smell.)I had purchased a different brand of vinyl mats in the past and the heat from a closed up vehicle made the plastic chemical to ""smell up the cab"", so I am allowing these mats to air out for 24 hours outside in the sun, to safe guard this from happening with the Rubber Queen mats.I do wish that Rubber Queen would make a vinyl mat that would go across the entire back of the RAV 4, so the middle carpet would be protected too!"
3,works no impressed by thinkness,This was my first experience ordering floor matts online. I was not impressed by the product when it arrived: the material is rather thin and soft. This makes cutting the material a breeze but I fear longevity of the product will fail. I recomend going to your local auto-store or junk yard and buying one there.Pros:Easy to cutNice pricePlenty of grooves to catch dirtCons:Thin/soft material
2,These are NOT Gray!!,"I'll try to post a picture, but these are beige, not gray. But, they ARE marked, and factory sealed as gray. I'm assuming they are the beige version, and maybe there was a mistake...but I dont think I'd chance it...these are definitely not gray....now I have to deal with a return!!"
4,Great for the price.,Pros: Great price for a durable floor mats. Does not slide.Cons: The two front are a bit big for car. The two back are small.I try these on 2010 Honda Fit and 2001 Toyota Avalon. The Avalon fir a bit better.
4,Good Product,"Not a bad product for the money. Large enough to cover majority of floor pan area on the driver and passenger's sides. Had to trim around the left foot rest on the driver's side, which cut into some of the molded channeling. Not a big deal since it's up hill from the main mud/snow collection area."
2,Color is NOT as portrayed online.,"I just received my mats and the Grey color is almost Black and not at all as shown in the photograph on Amazon. I have never seen a Grey car interior that is this dark, and it isn't even close to the carpeted grey mats from the same seller (unless those photos are also deceiving). However, they do not smell bad. I have not tried them in the car yet because I am considering returning them and do not want to unpackage them until I decide what to do."
4,As expected great sounding amp,"I needed a amp for my Roland drum set up at home. I bought this Crown to use with some Peavey 3-way PA speakers. I expected the amp to be built well and sound great, and it did not disappoint. Clear crisp highs, uncolored sound, w/ enough power to make my digital drum set come aliveand sound more like an acoustic set. I also use my Keyboard through this set up. 4 stars instead of 5 only because the fans are a bit loud. This is really not an issue for me, but I know it would matter to others using this in-home."
5,one of the best amps,"This amp. is probably one of the best amps I ever had. It is powerful, can move any speakers, I use this amp with 2 15"" Peaveys and 2 double 15"" Custom all together, and believe me I can shake any place."
3,Maybe a little outdated,"I believe power amps are being produced much lighter these days. If I was going to buy another, that's what I'd be looking for. As far as this unit, I've had it quite a while and it still works. I can't really make any claims about its sound quality because it powers speakers that aren't top of the line."

2,50/50,"Everquest is a good game but it has its problems. The graphics and the variety of sights are amazing. Even though it has it problems this game actually does have a quest system.If you like soloing or do not want to have to group with others to play, then this game is not for you. You can usually only solo effectively up into the 20s but that also depends on the class you are playing.The reason I only gave it 2 stars though is because I didnt find out many things that were important until after playing for hours and hours."
2,Don't Waste your money!,"I'm thankful I was given this game as a gift, because I would be seriously upset if I had paid money for this. First off, Sony was too cheap to actually give you all the discs you need to install this software and you have to spend hours downloading the rest of the program from their website. Second, you have to pay $12.95 per month to have the honor to play this game, NOT a small fee. And when you finally get to the point when you can play the game, it lacks direction and has akward controls. But don't worry, you'll be disconnected every fifteen minutes so you won't have to waste your time on this game.What I don't understand is how Sony expects people to buy this game when you can purchase many other similar games (Diablo 2, Baldur's Gate) that you can play online for no additional cost (or play wihtout having to log on at all). Spend your money on something else."
2,Commiting suicide has never been easeir!,"This game is unexplicably fun, it drives you insane when your character dies, it makes you go into tears when you acquire your spells. THIS GAME IS EVIL...First off you do one thing, kill, kill, and kill. Sure there are quests and of course tradeskills, but those two things are only possible by killing, and get boring and pointless. SO then you just end up killing everything, you keep going and going until it sucks your brain dry. DON'T buy this game..."
3,Don't bother unless you have plenty of time.,"I've played the game since it came out last year and it is fun to play but the design is for group play and group play only and this is the problem. If you have hours to burn on a regular basis then grouping shouldn't be a problem, but if you would like to get a hour or two in of playing time or if you don't like grouping then Everquest would be more fustraiting than fun. And grouping effectively requires people who know what they are doing; I have been killed so many times in groups it's not even funny. The game can be great fun but it can also give you an ulcer. If you have friends or family who will play when you play then go for it, if not I would wait on a more solo friendly game."
2,must improve customer service,"I too am part of the Everquest world, as is my wife. We both have characters that are lvl 50. We are looking forward to the expansion just to try something new. The only complaint I have about the game is the very poor customer service. They refuse to answer to your concerns. They refuse to deal with your complaints in a expidient manner. The system is set up so that all issues are handled in game. There is no contact made outside of the game.. no email help.. no telephone help.. nothing.. you really are in their world now when you play this game and their world is a dictatorship. Why do we keep playing? Because of the wonderfull people that we have met who also play. The concept and game play scores a 4 out of 5.. the customer service scores a 0 out of 5"
1,Ruins of Kunark,"Well don't get too excited. It seems Verant is interested inselling the scraps ommited from the original design because of the popularity. But this time with Lizard people! Woo how unique. Anyway the game still has no story, no coherent history really, no roleplaying potential, just a nice item to buy so you can continue to raise stat scores to unparalleled heights. Have fun (I wish they would sell something from the good people at middle earth)"
2,Not for your average gamer.,"While this game is an impressive technical achievement that manages to work pretty well for hundreds of users at a time, it haas a number of flaws that will ruin the game for many.The game world is very detailed and the play is engrossing for many many hours, which is also the problem. In order to advance in this cyber-world, you need to be able and willing to devote HUNDREDS or THOUSANDS of hours to play it, far more than a casual player like myself cares to commit.Less than halfway through the game ceases to be much fun and becomes tedious. In my opinion this is because the designers decided to concentrate on making the game difficult instead of fun."
2,For those that have too much time on thier hands.,"Everquest provided me with enjoyment throughout the lower levels of my character's life, but as time went on, reality set in. Basically it becomes a quest for money and equipment. You will sit in one spot killing the same monster over and over again for hours in hopes of gaining a bit of experiance points. Should you die, you lose experiance and all those hours of ""camping"" were for nothing. At higher levels it is impossible to play the game solo and gain anything from it. You will be required to make friends with people and hope they ""allow"" you to join a party in order to gain experiance and loot. As for graphics and the interface, I would have to say that they are fine. If you have alot of time on your hands, play EverQuest.. otherwise, look to the ""other"" online RPG."
3,Things you can't see by looking at the box,"First off -- as a piece of programming, EverQuest truly is amazing. It's an enormous world, with a lot of possibilities. However, in a game like this, that's not all you get when you open the box.You're also getting the people within the game. I think this is mostly up to you, but if you don't want to interract with and sometimes depend on others -- look elsewhere.The last part is the customer service. I have to say everquest has probably the most awful customer relations policies and staff I have ever seen from a company ANYWHERE. Don't count on having your questions answered, your problems resolved, or your bugs acknowledged.Balance all that when making your choice."
3,Amazingly wonderful game with so-so services.,"Everquest is entirely online. This makes for a great game and the progression and excitement of the game are the best I have ever seen. But...as in all things, there is a catch. Since this is only played online, you are at the mercy of the Everquest network. Servers crash on a regular basis and some areas of the game are heavily lagged.All in all though, I feel it is a great game when it is working. It is a addictive and fun. Just stay away from the ""Nameless Server""!"
1,RavenWarrior From Prexus Server,"Like many RPG addicts, I chose to ignore the warnings and go ahead and get EverQuest. After the initial ooo's and aaaah's wore down, I realized one horrible fact. The online gaming community that Verant has going on is horrible. The players treat each other with little or no regard, and Verant staff do nothing about it. And if you want to say the heck with them and solo, FORGET IT. There is such a horrible gap in the creature/zone level that even if you are lucky and can kill a yellow con on your own, a red con comes along, agro's on you, and you are dead. Save your hard earned money and seek elsewhere for an enjoyable experience. Wait for Icewind Dale or Diablo 2."
2,EverLevel would be a more appropriate name...,"EverQuest consists of wonderful graphics, an easy to use interface, and an addiction factor somewhat steeper than crack. At first I had a wonderful time playing, but then after time the only true goal of the game seemed to be to move your little ""Experience Bar"" up to get to the next Level, then repeat. It's major sufferings as a massively multiplayer online game (no roleplaying to it) are in part how incredibly impersonal it is compared to other online games, and the inability to adventure with friends whom have somewhat more advanced characters. There are just too many other online games out there, similar but superior than EQ. If you pick it up, be sure to watch it... games like these are VERY addictive."
4,Still the most fun game I have ever played.,"I admit I am addicted. I always loved MUDs. EverQuest is simply the best MUD ever made. It has some drawbacks, overcrowding, bugs, quests which are simply kill these monsters and bring back these things for a prize, but the number one problem is time commitment.Oh, EQ plays fine on slower hardware (200MHz Pentiums and 28.8 modems), but it needs at least Voodoo 2 level video performance.This game has consumed nearly all of my free time in the past year! I'm hooked. I look forward to the Kunark addition and will buy it ASAP."
1,"a Powerleveler's dream, Roleplayers need to look elsewhere","Sorry to burst the bubble of all the people who thought that this would be a great way to roleplay online, because to be honest. I've had the game for a number of months now and I've seen distrubingly low amounts of Role Playing in this game, if you are one of those people who insisted on finding every secret in the Final Fantasy series of games, and don't care if there is an interesting story surrounding your god-like character (which will take you thousands of gamplay hours to create, and you still will not be on par with the toughest monsters in the game). Then ignore my one out of five star rating and knock yourself out. Oh and as a side note be prepared to be exploited by Verant at every corner, because to them you are just $9.89 a month nothing more."
2,Great until the last 10 pages,"This was an excellent book until the last 10 pages when it appears the author tired of writing and wrapped everything up in a big hurry. Poor, poor ending. Get this one from the library"
5,Good,It was the perfect shape and size nd it works great! The only thing I didn't like was that it took forever for them to ship but that was the only problem and it's great that they send two!
1,A sleep inducer...,"I found this book about as exciting as reading last week's weather report.I waded through it but finally gave up a little from the end.Language and the derivation of words and phrases is an interesting and colorful subject;but little was found in this book.There is much more to producing a good book than collecting up a bunch of stuff and sticking it between a couple of covers.Don't waste your ""coin"" (not covered by the way) as you'll forget what's in it as soon as you read it."
1,very disappointed,"I purchased this for our family. Opened it brand new out of the boxand it will not work. Light bulb is not included.The company we purchased it from will not returnour emails. In addition, we paid over $92 (including shipping) and nowI see it priced at less than $50.00Gagne Opaque Art Projector"
3,"""Van-Fluff"", the perfect way to describe it.","This over all prequel to motion picture is just an overblown fluff piece that could have been saved or perhaps will show up on the eventual DVD release of Van Helsing.The animation feature is nicely done and the sound is great. The supliments are more or less a kind of press junket for te feature film follow-up.At only a half-hour running time, you wish it was at least 80 mins. Hugh Jackman and the cast provide voice talent to bring this 'teaser' to life.Rating: 3 1/2 stars out of 5"
4,Van Helsing,"I rate this cartoon movie at three stars, but the documentary is worthy of 5 stars. Its actually worth the price just for the documentary. Its basically a great making of feature about the 2004 Van Helsing film."
4,Meet Van Helsing,"This adventure is the prequel for the Van Helsing movie. The animation is good, and the fact that Hugh Jackman does his own vocals is a definite plus. The story has him facing Mister Hyde, which is a great premise for a movie. Definitely worth watching.Extras include a look into the making of the movie, and the making of the video game, as well as an interview with Hugh Jackman. All in all, a great value for the price."
1,"Jewelless Clown, err crown..........","WELL! This is certainly a silly little piece of fluff suitable for the Saturday morning toons and featuring dreadful, flat animation ..... nothing special here folks, more or less like flipping through a cartoon in the doctor's waiting room .... destined to become cult - perhaps - but at what price?Overpriced?[Really brings shame to old Hyde/Jeckyll tale ....better see Mary Reilly for some pure chills!]"
2,"Uh, not so good","While some of the scenes were breath-taking, the animation beautiful, the action well-done, and the actors from the movie voiced their characters in this short, the plot and story were completely lacking. It's like they were aiming for weird instead of cool and good. The full length theater movie is much, much better. I am very glad I just rented London Assignment instead of wasting $10 by buying it."
1,Not Terrafirma,"This item is not manufactured by Terrafirma Ceramics, Inc of Astoria, NY. **Please clarify this in the description.** The description lists features as if it is one of our company's handmade products, however it is not nor is it similar to any of our designs or pieces. The item appears in amazon.com search results grouped with authentic Terrafirma Ceramics listings making it quite confusing- and misleading.We were alerted to this listing by customers.Thank you,DarciAssistant to the DesignerTerrafirma Ceramics, IncAstoria, NY USA"
5,The best of yesteryear of cumbia colombiana,"This cd is a gem. I purchased it many years ago well aware that the cd was full of old original cumbia songs but some of the greatest in my opinion and definitely well be cheerished by true fans of this unique genre. It has some of Colombia's finest groups who have perfected this rhythm and by listening to it really does take you to point in time that only most of us can imagine but I am sure holds beautiful memories for those who grew up in Colombia when these songs were popular. The only downfall of this cd is it's too short but it is a nice a compilation for those who are fans of authentic cumbia. You will certainly recognize classic songs such as: Tabaco y Ron, Amaneciendo, Se me perdio la cadenita, El pescador de Baru among others. This is a gem of a cd."
1,not happy,"I was thrilled when I received this as a gift! But so frustrated as it will not play on any of our players...not even the Blu-Ray player. If I wanted to watch it on the computer/laptop, I could have skipped putting it on my gift list and watched it for free on Youtube! Nowhere on the DVD or case does it indicate that it won't play in our region."
2,wrong format,It was in the PAL format which doesn't play on my dvd player and apparently according to other reviews here i'm not the only one who has encountered this problem. Be careful when ordering this and ensure that you can play PAL or buy elsewhere.
5,A wonderful scholarly work on behavioral profiling.,An excellent read for anyone who is interested in the science of profiling. Contains techniques and approaches that are unique to the field.
3,"A general overview of profiling, but has its weaknesses","Generally, the book presents an average overview of offender profiling. However, the Editors give credit to the FBI in several passages for the rape model, power assertive, anger retaliatory, etc, but it was in fact Prentky and Knight who first developed this type of rape classification scheme. Also, the book claims to represent researchers' opinions from all around the world on 'profiling,' however, the fact is, there is not one American author in the book.Maurice Godwin PhD"
3,"Changed lives across denominations, races and socio-economic groups.","Dr. Solomon's insights belong only to those to whom God ""graces"" them. Poor reviews of Dr. Solomon's books merely reveal that the reader has not been ""graced by God"" to ingest, digest and be fortified by these gigantic spiritual insights. All of Dr. Solomon's materials have caused me (my family, friends and counsellees) to better hear, accept and understand God's Word. The person hoping to be ""added to"" intellectually will achieve that hope, provided God grants him the grace to receive this divinely inspired material. All of Solomon's books should be approached as opportunities to grow and learn spiritually."
1,This video was not Tuina,I purchased this video and watched it and thought...what the heck it that?Then I went to China to study Tuina and there is no comparison to this Massage Nerd Tuina Video and the actual Chinese Tuina techniques. Please do not buy this. His techniques are not Tuina.
5,GREAT!,Wow! It looks like Virginia Chang is promoting her school through Amazon. I thought it was great and I learned so much.
4,Competent. Enjoyable.,"The Isles is a fascinating look at the history of England, Wales, Scotland, and Ireland. Some may opine that the subject matter is much too vast for one volume, but Norman Davies succeeds in what he sets out to do. While some very historic personages and events receive limited exposure, The Isles, as an overview, is well worth the read. The book hits the doldrums nearly two-thirds through, but this doesn't diminish the value of reading this one from cover to cover."
3,TWO GOOD BOOKS UNDER ONE COVER,"DAVIES STARTED TO WRITE A VERY GOOD NARRATIVE OF THE ISLES, WITH VERY DETAILED SOCIO-POLITICAL EXPLANATIONS FOR IMPORTANT EVENTS - UNTILL 1707. THEN THE AUTHOR WRITES A DIFFERENT BOOK. THE SECOND HALF COVERING THE PERIOD AFTER 1707 IS MORE OF A CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY TEXTBOOK, COVERING VERY FEW POLITICAL EVENTS, AND CHRONOLOGY THAT IS MORE OF A STREAM OF CONCIOUSNESSBOTH IN THEIR OWN RIGHT ARE INTERESTING, HOWEVER, I HAD TO GIVE THE BOOK 3 STARS BECAUSE IT IS SUFFERING FRON AN IDENTITY CRISIS, AND LEAVE THE READER WITH CONFLICTING IDEAS OF THE HISTORICAL RELATIONSHIPS PRESENTED BY THE AUTHOR."
2,Too Pedantic By Miles,"Davies starts out the book with a silly discussion of names of palce sin the isles and then goes on to impose a brand new nomeclature because of some academic argument that no reasonable reader will care about. This issue then persists throughout the book. I ordered this from the UK months ago because I was so eager to get it. This issue so bogged me down that I abandoned the book hal;fway through, something I never do. It's a shame because this is a comprehensive and valuable book in many ways."
4,"Polemic, yes; History, maybe.","Norman Davies' last book, on the history of Europe, was perhaps the best book of its kind. It is that admiration and enjoyment from reading that last book which led me to pick up this one, on the history associated with the British Isles. However, I would characterize this book as being a much better assertion of a very persuasively argued point of view about history of the British Isles than a telling of history. This was not the flaw of his last opus magnum. There are many typos in the first edition which i picked up and read with great excitement; but viewed in light of how I have characterized the book, even the typos are amusingly ideosyncratic. Ultimately, this is an ideosyncratic book, one that should be read after considerable prior exposure to the history of Britain and the British sensibility. Then, one can enjoy Norman Davies' book for what it is: a construction of how history ought to be approached as a living argument, lively argued."
2,Far from the best,"This mish-mash of straight historical narrative (and a history of the ""kings and queens"" sort and not a social or even economoc history) and historiography is often difficult to follow, much less learn from. What does the use of the work ""Britain"" by other writers, the general public, or Library of Congress Subject Headings have to do with history? (and as an aside on the last point, there has been long and agonizing debate in library circles about which term should be used and for what geographic part, not a simple error as Davies would like to prove). Why illustrate historical events with romanticized paintings from later times? Why disect other historians' views of history instead of writing something new? Why stud the text with references to contemporary items such as the movie Braveheart or the Irish singing group incorrectly called The Corries? This scatter-shot version of history adds little new information and ignores areas better documented elsewhere."
5,The BEST of the best!!,"A lot of people at school have this CD player and we love it.Everything on it is perfect! The Cool and Sleek design is very awesome, the sound is crystal clear, and it has never skipped once! You can turn it upside down, on it's side, jog, run, play it in the car and it never skips once!The Mega Bass works really well and at the volume's highest setting (it can go really loud)the sound doesn't even crack. For the money it even comes with a car kit!I have had this CD player for 3 years (I have one of the older models) and it still works like I just bought it! I use this Cd player everyday for at least 3 hours a day and I haven't bought new batteries in 4 months, it only takes 2 AA's!!"
1,when i recive the item was broke,tuve una mala experiencia porque cuando el paquete me llegoel lente no funcionaba y estaba roto el cristal principal.i have a bad experience whith this lens cause when i get tha lensthe cristal was broke.
2,A good kit lens,"Slow lens, nice optics, very lightweight but fragile in appearance. Consider instead the 18-200 mm with vibration reduction. The latter lens is incomparable in its utility when compared to the former."
1,very bad.,"This is a very bad lens. It's not really sharp at any aperture, and has bad barrel distortion at all focal lengths. Also, terrible chromatic aberration. It might be ok for small pictures for web sites, if you don't care much about the results."
2,will break down,"The lens breaks down easily! The lens is supported on the camera by mechanically weak clippers. After some time (< 1.5 years in my case) the strain broke down the clippers. I always keep the camera in a cushioned case, and it suffered no shocks or drops."
1,AUTO FOCUS LOCKS UP,"The Auto-Focus feature of this lens started to lock-up after about 6 months. It was one of two Nikon lenses that I use. The other lens works fine. Sent it to Nikon for service 3 TIMES (yes 3) and each time they sent back the same lens and said nothing was wrong with it. After the 2nd return I went to my local camera shop to try a duplicate lens on my camera body, no problem. Pop on my original lens and it locks up after a few shots. Tried my lens on a another camera body in the store and it locks up on that body. Nikon does not stand by their warranty. This has dragged out over a period of two months and many phone calls. Nikon told me before sending the camera back for a 3rd time that they would replace the lens. They didn't. NIKON IS NOT THE COMPANY THEY USED TO BE."
4,Good Lens,My wife is the editor of the yearbook at her school. One of the kids dropped the yearbook camera and broke the lens. They can not be with out a lens so we found this replacement on Amazon. It works very well for her purpose. It is very light and durable. We are very pleased with this lens.
4,This is a best buy lens!,"I love this lens, it`s cheap, it's sharp, it`s clear, it`s easy tu use. The best for the begginer. The only con that i foud is that the front of the lens rotates to fix focus."
2,Sub-par,"I guess the product is ok. The problem I have with this lens is that it was made with good intentions but falls short in every way. It doesn't have VR, so most of your shots will come out soft, fuzzy, or down-right messed up. It doesn't have a wide F stop so you can't even PRETEND to use it in low lighting conditions. AND it only goes out to 55mm which is a joke as far as zooming goes. If you are shooting outside in daylight, and you can afford to move around a lot, then this lens is ok for wide angle shots; the optics in this lens are definitely not as good as a nifty fifty, and not as convenient as an 18-135 (if you choose not to get VR, the price is very comparable) making this lens a bad buy in my book.Do yourself a favor and save a little more for an 18-135 (for convenience), an 18-200 (for MORE convenience) or any of the above (18-55, 18-135, 18-200) **WITH VR***."
5,"At last after countless lenses, a cheapie does it","I bought this lens for a Canon DSLR, along with the Nikon/Canon mount to change f stops. I shoot fully manual always, so AF, and auto anything don't mean much to me. This lens is the first lens I can say ""wow"", when I shoot the sky with the sun in frame, sunset, sun in the sky midday, it doesn't matter, the sun looks great, no weird green globs of flare. I would not use this for night shots, but for a daylight lens, it's the best I have used, and like I said I have tried at least 30 lenses to find a good sky lens, and it takes cheap easy to get 52mm filters. You can see the flare examples at...thedigitalpicture.com lens flare testI have not ever found a better lens for this, and this review site shows it"
5,Great lens - Great macro,"I am very pleased with this lens. I mostly bought it for macro photos, but is gave me a whole new perspective for a ""normal"" lens for digital 35 mm SLR. Very pleased indeed."
3,ok buy,this was an okay buy. it didn't have a stabilizer. read descriptions carefully! quality was okay just not exactly what I wanted
3,it's okay,"It's limited because of the size, but also get lighter because of the size. for normal use it's good enough, but a longer one will be better."
5,Great Lens for the $,Great pick for your first lens. Works well on my D80. Its affordable and takes great pictures in a variety of settings!
2,Broken...twice,"This is a good all-purpose lens...when it works! I have sent it back to Nikon once because the autofocus failed to work. Now less than 1 year later, it is failing again. I suggest that you spend a little more and get a better lens. I have had Nikons for more than 30 years and love the cameras but this lens is not of the quality that I expect from Nikon."
2,"Pretty Good, While it Lasts","Our family has owned two of these already. They should come with an expiration date. They only seem to last about a year, before the auto-focus mechanism becomes hopelessly frozen. The images are great while the thing works. Nikon used to stand for durability and quality, it seems they've walked away from that. One drawback is the high f-stop, you need to use a flash in all but the brightest light."
2,An Elementary School Reference Book,"I was really looking forward to seeing this book (my sister ordered it for me for Christmas as I have no credit card), but I was very disappointed in the cheesy kiddie graphics of the maps and in the irrelevant space-filling color photos, most of which have little to do with any serious consideration of the topic at hand. The text is also filled with grammatical errors--very disappointing considering its theme. I guess I will have to keep on referring to my old black and white photocopied maps and articles from the Brittanica which, though sometimes dated, are the best resource I have out here in rural Korea. I am very disappointed in Mister Comrie who I know is a very reputable scholar of language universals and linguistic typology."
2,Written by linguists who failed semantics,"I have often thought that such a language tool should be written; now I think it needs an editor. The book was a fine effort, but, nebulous linguistic boundaries aside, the book presented as fact statements that simply are not true. For example, the Irish ""O"", seen on so many surnames, does not mean ""son of,"" as the book states, but rather ""grandson of."" Unfortunately, this is only one example of faulty research. The book is well researched in its presentation of grammar forms and linguistic boundaries (making for a good atlas), but the faulty research and questionable timelines ruin the finished product. Caveat: this book should only be used by linguists who will recognize errors when they come across them; a non-linguist might become seriously impaired in further linguistic research by this book."
2,Full Of Mistakes,"At first sight, The Atlas Of Languages seems like a very interesting and highly educating book. But as soon as I started to read it, I encountered mistake after mistake. Not only are the maps inaccurate and rather badly done, there are also lots of factual errors.In other words, this book is yet another of way too many sad examples of... compromises between layout and `popular science'.The only reason I keep this book in my bookcase is for reference purposes. And even those, I would always have to doubt about their credibilty!"
3,atlas of mistakes,"amazing amount of silly mistakes: improper translations of simple and unambigous words, sakhalin is called a peninsula just a few pages after a map which clearly shows that it is an island, etc.frustrating"
4,The crack cocaine of RPG,"This game is totally assome, then suddenly it over. I recommendgetting it it is much better than darkstone! END"
3,Comes close,Control is a lacking feature in this game. It alos seems to be a bit too linear in its play making it lack in the RPG category. All in all I found it to be enjoyable and I loved the Jerry Garcia herb dealer. Nicely done.
4,Radiohead-like potential,"For anyone who loves Radiohead, Poleposition is a band you definitely want to check out. These guys have a lot of potential and I can't wait for a follow-up album. The EP has a nice background piano with great inventive beats and a Thom Yorke-like voice. Check it out!"
4,Ork Warlord Grimnosh sayz,Much better den da last two. 'E has done more research and haz written it more reader friendly den da uvver two. Salvation was a bit boring and Dawn of War really 'ad the background shafted but dis is far superior to dose two. A touch anticlimatic I feel toward the end but better. I look forward to even better novels from Goto.
1,"Rubbish, nothing more","Anyone that is even remotly familiar with W40k will see that this book is absolute rubbish. If you read it I pity you, and if you like this nonsence I pitty you even more. Goto is the worst 40k writer and puts W40k literature to shame. It is very dulled down and just...I can't explain it. Its funny thats for sure, a good joke really. Save your money and buy some other good W40k books, not this crap, please."
2,Look Elsewhere in the 40k Universe,"Goto tries to do too much with this tale and ends up doing too little. The book starts immediately with a furious battle against the Tyranid swarm that goes on and on. I had to skim through it to find a breather where some semblance of an introduction to the characters occurs. Unfortunately, the characters are hollow cliches and the Tyranid swarm uninteresting. Injected into the main story is a space battle that doesn't fit at all. I really like the 40k Universe, but I gave up on this about two-thirds of the way through it. Try Dan Abnett and be happy for it."
2,Cobble together.,Throw together a storyline include every gender try to attain the ultimate cross section of buyers. Who will it appeal to.????? build characters despite being shallow and unrealistic represent empowerment. Where are the commercials????
2,Beautiful,"I finally got this one!It is very elegant but I bought it one size bigger and it fits perfectly.So you may want to consider buying a bigger size.The color is very suave and the design , sophisticated.A very good buy at a great price.I bought it for 11 bucks!Would give this 5 stars(for some reason amz is not letting meupdate ranking!) ."
4,Good stories from a misogynist,"eBook downloaded from [...]Collection of short stories on nautical themes. Includes: A change of treatment, A love passage, The captain's exploit, Contraband of war, A black affair, The skipper of the ""Osprey,"" In borrowed plumes, The boatswain's watch, Low water, In mid-Atlantic, After the inquest, In Limehouse Reach, An elaborate elopement, The cook of the ""Gannet,"" A benefit performance, A case of desertion, Outsailed, Mated, The rival beauties, Mrs. Bunker's chaperon, A harbour of refuge.Mostly interesting period stories, some with an intriguing twist at the end but clearly the author did not think well of women!"
5,Great book to begin with!,"I'm only about halfway (okay, not that far, even) through the book, and I've learned a lot. I've even had a couple of very short conversations with people in Chinese, and they've told me that I speak very well, so the book certainly does its job. The tapes are indispensible.The book covers pronunciation and the different tones very well. I've got a lot left to read, but I'm very, very happy with the course over all! I WOULDN'T buy it, though, as a new, updated version is coming out in the U.S. in January, I believe. For more information on that, go to:http://www.teachyourself.co.uk"
1,Avoid the Game Like the Plague,"Nice ideas, terribly executed. Game crashes often, graphics are poor, strategic game is annoying. A total waste of money; even Eidos is giving refunds."
3,Great game without much of a plot,"I bought this game thinking that I had found the perfect game to mirror Braveheart the movie. After getting the software configurations figured out and downloading a patch I began to realized that this game is in no way perfected. It is such a great concept but as it stands now, its just and average game with a lack of any sort of direction. Maybe next time!"
5,Great for walking with my dog,"This is my second purchase of this product. I gave one to my husband for his birtday, but he never used it. I began using it and decided to buy one that fit my height. Now we both use them when we walk our dog. They are comfortable and sturdy."
3,Beautiful stick but needs grip on top.,"1. Ok but needs something more than just being a very pretty walking stick.2. Beautiful wood and well crafted. Many compliments.When you need help for balance, I don't like my hand slipping down the top. I'mgoing to ck out bike handle grips and then cut to size.3. Anyone that has to use an assistive device daily for walking will benefit from this stick.Canes and walkers don't allow you to stand straight up. Sticks do."
5,great walking stick,"Nice walking stick- I've looked at many before buying this one- it's the right weight, smooth finish- perfect for hiking the hills."
5,A stout staff!,"This is a beauty! My kids laughed at me when I opened its container, but I explained the need and use for a quality hiking staff. This hickory staff is beautifully handcrafted and somewhat heavy. It has style and with a bit of practice is a solid self-defense tool! I love mine. The next time we have to hike up a hill or down a steep side, the staff will assist me . . . we will see if the kids are laughing! :-)"
5,Beautiful and Functional,This is the perfect watch for everyday wear. It is very sturdy and keeps time perfectly. I had no problem setting the day/date and time functions (just read the directions that come with the watch). I have had this watch for approximately 1 month and have had absolutely NO problems. I love this watch and I wear it everyday. Definitely recommend!
3,Amitron,"I am very disapointed in the quailty of the watch, The crystal has broken twice, not sure why this happens ?"
2,Less than expectation,I was disapointed in this watch. I have been unable to regulate the daily change of day and date to correspond with the time. It does keep good time and looks nice though.
4,Not bad,"Hero was very sexy and the mystery was good but some times there was just too much forced sexual tension. Overall, I enjoyed it very much"
3,smells like soap.,"The fragrance is okay, if you like the smell of dish soap, or a little girls dress up perfume. The bottle and tin are very cute, will look nice on my vanity table."
5,Great addition,"This was a great addition to my collection of books, I got it fast and love it. A must have when you are working with aromatherapy."
5,Great All Day Hose,These pantyhose are great to wear all day long. A long day at work these keep your legs feeling good energizing you. Not the hose you would wear for a night on the town but very good to wear all day long to keep your legs refreshed.
1,Scoppettone's Worst Ever Effort,"Scoppettone's storytelling in Beautiful Rage lacks her usual passion, and the action and characterizations seem forced. All the elements of a good novel are here, but the spark seems to be missing. This is most noticeable in the dialogue, which is especially wooden and stiff.I will give Ms. Scoppettone another chance, as I've been made to understand that she herself isn't very fond of this book. My copy of This Dame for Hire is next up on my reading list."
1,Disappointing,"I've not read any other of Ms Scoppettone's books, but this is so badly written that I couldn't finish it. As another reviewer noted, the dialogue was excreable."
1,newborn baby hat,"Is this the best you can do.I have a beautiful grandchild, why should you have all this stupid writing on the front."
1,NOT 18/10,"Amazon needs to stop saying flatware sets are 18/10 in the title when they are not. This is lower-quality 18/0, it even says so in the description. I've noticed this across other flatware sets on their site as well."
2,not 19/10,"Contrary to what is said, the product is not 18/10 silver. We found that out after purchase."
1,waste of money and time,"Do not waste your time and money on this Film. I heard Cedric the Entertainer on the Steve Harvey show pushing this movie. I am so disapponted that so many talented actors agreed to lower their standards and actually make this silly, Saturday Morning Cartoon Movie. Maybe the kids may get it but I did not."
1,Stupid movie!,"The acting was bad. The story was bad. The guy with the eye patch was constantly screaming. Do not buy this movie even if it was on sale!!!! Was this supposed to be a comedy/action - no one laughed when we watched it. I was hoping that there was something relevant in the movie, so we tried to watch it till the end, but there was nothing.....what a waste of our time! Argghh!"
1,Possibly the worst film I've seen,"I absolutely HATE this movie, just got it a couple of weeks ago and already I am trying to sell it. I brought it on blind faith, simply because I am a fan of Cedric the entertainer, but this movie sucks. DO NOT BUY IT....unless you like terrible movies that are not funny and make no sense. Waste of time and money indeed."
2,Not that Funny....very disappointing :(,"i was expecting this to be really funny....especially since it had Cedric The Entertainer and Tommy Davidson.......but was sadly mistaken....i really , really did want to like this....i tried to laugh at certain parts, but if u have to try and laugh..its not worth it.....**sigh**"
5,Nice Varity,I like that this will come in handy for any patriotic event I cook for. Very fresh and super service.Thanks!
3,"They do the job, but aren't perfect","I purchased these slippers for my fiance, since she has circulation problems in her feet. In short, they warm her feet very well and she loves them. While some other reviewers didn't like the scent of the aromatherapy packet, we found it pleasing. On the downside, ""one size fits most"" should be ""one size fits huge"". It turned out the large size isn't much of a problem considering you can't walk very effectively in them (especially if you have tiny feet like my fiance) with the heating/scent packs in them. Nonetheless, even with these flaws, they keep her feet warm and toasty on the couch."
1,eehhh....,"Once you get the heating packet out and back in (which is not easy) it works great for warming. Unfortunately I almost gag from the ""aroma therapy"". It smells HORRIBLE... find some with no ""aroma"". You'll be glad you did."
3,"Read on, blues fans","My recommendation to serious fans is to buy and read <<Spinning Blues into Gold>>, then go on to other sources that greatly add color and substance to Ms. Cohodas' rather spare narrative. By all means check out <<Chicago Blues: The City and the Music>> by Mike Rowe, <<I Am the Blues>> by Willie Dixon, and <<A Life in Rhythm and the Blues>> by Jerry Wexler.The key contributions of the Cohodas book are 1) its fresh emphasis on the marketing and production aspects of the Chess operation, and 2) its attempt to debunk some widely accepted derogatory tales about Leonard Chess. For example, she has several sources to refute Keith Richards' famous story about Muddy Waters painting the ceiling. Thought-provoking stuff."
4,"Kings of the blues, Chicago style","This is the story of the Chess brothers and their record company located in Chicago. Phil and Leonard Chess were a couple of Jewish immigrants who wanted to make money and saw a way to do so through the recording of black music (mostly blues, r&b, r&r, soul--some jazz) in the windy city. The Chess roster was impressive and featured the best of the post-WW II blues singers (Muddy Waters, Jimmy Rogers, Howling Wolf, Little Walter, just to name a few). Leonard was a tough cookie willing to help his uneducated, living-on-the-edge stable of artists--help, but no charity. The company was sold in the late 60s and soon after collapsed. I had the good fortune to speak with Nadine Cohadas about this book (and the book she wrote about Dinah Washington), and she was dedicated to getting the facts right and tracking down every lead. She was fascinated by her subject, and I think she conveys that well in the book. Scholarly, but not stuffy."
1,Blues Snooze,"I've probably read three dozen books on blues music and artists and can honestly say this was one of the most tedious. The author is clearly proud of her access to the Chess family, but there's little else in this book that makes it worth buying. Her analysis of the music itself is perhaps the weakest part of her text. Was she even familiar with the Chess catalog before working on this thing? Having read about the author's past career, I'd say she should stick to covering (""yawn"") congressional committee hearings and leave the story of blues music to someone familiar with it."
2,Only half the story,"I was excited to see a new book about this great record label. Unfortunately this is a rather one-sided affair based on the extensive interviews with the white label owners who got rich off the hard work of black musicians. Sadly, the legendary stars of Chess are almost all dead so the author depends on some very minor players to tell that side. And as another reviewer noted, the bibliography fails to mention an earlier history of the company, plus it also leaves out the Living Blues magazine history on Chess, which came out a few years ago. This is a good try but uneven."
2,Too expensive for what you get!,"The only reason this item is priced this high is because ""they can"".They feel they have the diesel community at their mercy!!"
1,eknor Apex NeverKink Hose Kinks Badly and has No Stifness,"Bought the 100' length of 4000 series commercial duty hose because reviews were good. In warm weather this ""commercial duty ??"" hose becomes very soft and kinks badly. It has NO flexural rigidity in bending or squeezing. It is tangles easily when being dragged in sections across the yard. Product is NOT Recommended. Product returned to Amazon."
1,3 years home use - broken,"I've owned several garden hoses over the years, these hoses were the most expensive I've ever bought (through a national chain hardware store). Just this Spring I noticed one of the hoses leaking, water was spraying me from behind, the outer sheath had split. Oh well, wrap it in some electrician's vinyl tape and keep using it. Then it split, and split again, and more holes appeared. Odd, because I have two of the 50 foot hoses in the front of the house, one of the 100 foot hoses in back, they have ALL started breaking down in the same way. Bummer is I've torn my file cabinet and all warranty folder/records apart and can't for the life of me find a receipt to take it back to the store... Oh yeah, they kink, definitely, you get used to it."
1,It's a rather kinky product,"I concur with the other reviewer, it is a rather average product. it kinks just as much as any regular hose."
3,"works, but not for me","Set up easily. I have a large music database and it worked as advertised, with some delays I attributed to the size of the itunes library. The reason I returned the unit was due to my layout between the controller (at stereo) and my computer (floor above). The signal would not reach from the remote to the computer unless I moved into a near line of sight arrangement (through railing to the computer on the floor above). That created a dead zone right where I would usually want to use the remote. So, price was fair, it worked, just not for me."
1,"Short Range, Intermittent, Failed Altogether","Took a long time to load iTunes library. After a few tunes had played it was not working. Quit and restarted iTunes then it started working, but only within a few feet of the computer! Failed again but this time was never able to reconnect. Warning: The software requires admin access (Mac OS X) to install and does not provide an uninstall feature. One more thing, the text on the remote is tiny."
5,Great unknowns!,"There is so much soul in this recording. Seasoned, yet unknown, these songwriters will forever be Rhode Island and Connecticut's best kept secret. Please, make more."
1,No trash trucks,"My son is 3 and did not like this movie. He loves trash trucks and it was all about ""Recycling"" in DETAIL and no trash trucks in action. Just keep that in mind if purchasing."
2,"Yep, NO Trash Trucks","So, I read the reviews. My boy is 4.5 so he's able to listen to the wealth of information it tells you about Garbage and Recycling, but he was sooooo disappointed that there were no trash trucks in action.If you kid likes to learn and likes hearing about the ""how"" then this will be great for them. If you he/she just wants to see some garbage trucks in action, forget it."
2,VERY outdated!,"The video is at least 15, if not 20 years old! My almost six year old son who loves garbage trucks wasn't very interested in it because it barely shows any garbage trucks! Definitely not one my sons will want to watch over and over again. Save your money!"
1,all about garbage and recycling,"Disappointed with this video. This is the same video that is on another all about video my son already has. Nothing new, exactly the same."
1,By far the most annoying video my son owns,My 3 year old son owns an array of truck/tractor/construction vehicle dvds. This did not hold his interest for long. The commentary is inane and annoying. The Mighty Machines series is much better in his opinion and in mine.
3,My Son Approves!,"This video does not keep my child's attention as well as other ""sanitation"" videos. My son still enjoys watching it."
2,"BRUSH AND BRUSH, YET, NO SHINE!","Unless you are a complete UNIX dummy, there is not much to expect (or benefit) from this book. Its meager 158 pages only succeeded in brushing around the very basics (and simple commands). Apart from its cogent narrations on how best a novice could explore UNIX applications and use command interface, there is little that shine in this book.Anyone who knows one or two things about UNIX is likely to be disappointed by its inept coverage. Hence, I would advise such person to opt for ""Mac OS X for Unix Geeks"", which provided a more palatable gist in a chronological order. Versatile enthusiasts, who are interested in advanced explorations, should consider ""Mac OS X Unleashed"". One of its chapters on Unix-Mac relationships did eclipse anything this book can boast of."
2,"A very thin book, I sent it back.","I was very disappointed when this book came. I didn't realize how thin this book would be from the description. I am a fan of the O'Reilly books, and their reputation led me to believe there would be a little more ""meat"" here.At a glance it appears to be well organized and written. This would be a good first half of a book, or the book should be half the price.I don't understand who the audience would be for this book. In my opinion (I might be wrong here) anybody who is even INTERESTED in the OSX terminal already knows about CD, LS, PWD, MKDIR, CHMOD, and MV... and that is half the book! I am going to be a lot more careful when I order O'Reilly books from now on.(Two stars because it is well organized but a third of what should be there)."
4,VERY basic,"This is a useful book for anyone who has no knowledge of UNIX commands, or whose knowledge is minimal. Otherwise, I would recommend ""Mac OS X for UNIX Geeks"" instead."
4,A good start,"This is a good start for Unix on OS X. However, I finished it quickly and it just left me with more questions and a need to purchase a more exhaustive book on Unix if I want to truly get into it.However, it does do a good job explaining the Unix file system, permissions and can help you streamline the process of copying or moving large numbers of files and dealing with their permissions without dealing with the Aqua interface which is overly cumbersome for those tasks."
2,Just too little information,"Like alot MacOS fans I was looking forward to OS X and a return to unix, which I have not used since graduating from college over a decade ago. But this book hardly scratches the surface. You might as well buy Pogue's OS X book, which covers roughly the same Unix information. I doubt anyone, using OS X, would seriously consider using pine as an email client so why the chapter? Instead of this book just find one the free unix sites ..."
3,Good book...,"if you are completely new to UNIX. If you buy ""MAC OS X Unleashed"" you will get more information about UNIX & Mac OS X plus more.If you are completely new to UNIX is a very good intro."
1,"So, I'm not buying it after all...","I've been waiting for this book. A few months, actually. With great expectations. What a bummer, reading the reviews so far. Summing up; since I've already got ""Mac OS X Unleashed"", ""Learning UNIX"", and ""Mac OS X Pocket Reference"", there's no point in getting this as well.Too bad - I really hoped for an in-depth 'manual' to the Mac OS X underpinnings.B"
5,Perfect size for studio-living,"Living in a small space within an urban area (possibility for little critters), and not having huge amounts of trash, I needed something that contained my trash with a lid and wanted something that had a removable lining. The 2.6 gallon model fits a grocery bag and simply is what I was looking for. On the plus side, it was cheaper on Amazon than a similar-model at Target."
1,Arrived Broken,For the price of this trash can it should have shown up in mint condition. Not only was the slow lowering lid broken...so was the lock on the front as well as the pedal to lift the lid. I know I should have sent it back but it's almost not even worth the trouble. I'm extremely dissatisfied.
5,This trashcan is the shiznit,"I love this trashcan. It's small enough to fit inbetween the seats in my RV, and uses regular grocery plastic bags, so you don't have to buy trashbags.Good build and quality to boot!"
1,Garbage!,I've owned this trash can for roughly three weeks and already it has malfunctioned. The foot pedal is broken and the lid only opens partway and is lopsided!
4,Needs Simple Modification,"There is no doubt that this is a product with superb design (the lid is even contoured for lifting by hand) and build quality. However, the normal operation of stepping on the foot pedal does jerk the lid open with a force that makes the whole can lurch backward. Do this a few times and the can works it's way against a wall or kitchen cabinet and can no longer open fully because the lid needs clearance from behind. Simply moving it forward and away from obstruction allows it to work again. I rated this 4 stars because it's an annoying characteristic that won't go away. The simple extension of plastic into a bumper would keep the hinged end away from walls and cabinets and fix this problem."
4,Pretty but could be improved,I like the all white can. This can fits 3 gallon trash bags. It is only about shin high and the improvement I would suggest is the possibility to lift the lid and have it stay up. This was too small for me to use in the kitchen. Would be good for other uses.
3,So-So,They Died Crawling was much better than this one. Maybe because I already knew a lot about the Torso murders that I was kind of bored with it. These are the first two I read and I am going to continue reading the other books he wrote about Cleveland's crimes and disasters. It is completely unfathomable to believe that nothing has ever came about regarding the Beverly Potts case. It is very disheartening.
5,Comfortable!,"This is the most comfortable shoes that I ever wore, its so fit and never hurt my feet, I can work and walk long hours with it on and I don't come plain. I love this shoes and I am hoping to buy more as soon as they are available in my size again. Highly recommended!"
2,Daikatana,"SHERLOCK HOLMES : Watson! It's dead as a dodo.DR WATSON : Are you sure?. What must have killed it,Holmes?HOLMES : The hype of course.....not to forget the long delay,outdated graphics, dumb A.I, frustrating gameplay and all the bugs.WATSON : Holmes.....Who is your prime suspect ?HOLMES : Tch Tch Watson, use your grey cells! It's John Romero of course, after professor Moriatry....he's my next 'nemesis'.WATSON : So what do we do now (Sher)lock ?HOLMES : Elementary, my dear Watson ?"
5,Daikatana-Game of the year,"I absolutely love this game, I am still playing through it as I write this and will be sad once I am done with the game. I don't understand all the harsh remarks I am reading in other reviews, but the this game is an excellent choice if you are looking for an all around superior FPS type game to play. The storyline is totally engrossing and compelling and the graphics old engine or not are the some of the most beautifully done I've seen to date, in some levels even breathtaking. I hope those of you who are reading these reviews won't take any of the harsh ones to heart without first playing Daikatana and seeing how awesome it is. I can't say enough about it. I loved it and gave it all 5 stars for superior gameplay, graphics and storyline. A truly incredible game... Daikatana Rocks!"
2,the box lies,"its made out to be a kung fu,meets super space intelligence meets d and d type stuff kinda vid.its just dark and not nearly exiting as all that.theres zero martial arts.the enemies are monsters not space age.its very hard to see what youre fighting.its extremely easy to beat.me and the ol lady took it out in a weekend."
2,Have not played it...and dont want to play it!,"I've waited for this game ever since Time published an article about the former IDsoftware design man. But when my brother bought the CD and played it, I simply was disgusted when I saw the poor quality of the game. Effort was put into this game but I guess it was all for nothing, as the game can hardly be played for a longer duration than half an hour. You get sick of the frogs and flies coming at you. You actually have to use an ion gun or whatever that is to kill a darn frog! A baseball bat would have done a better job. If you have played Half Life and still have the sweet taste of that lovely game in your mouth, I suggest you keep that taste in your mouth by not playing this game!"
1,Computer gaming has sunk to a new low.,"Well, after several years of promises and many delays, Daikatana is finally here. This will probably go down as one of the worst games in history. Why do I say this? The game's graphics look ten years old, there are so many bugs in the game that gameplay is almost impossible, and the game crashes at random times. However, the worst part is the customer service. It looks as though Eidos Interactive has already given up on the game. They keep promising to fix the various problems throughout the game, but it looks like these promises, just like the original release date, will be taken care of in about five years. However, there is an upside for having this game in your home. The box makes a great coaster for your soda."
1,Not So Great,"I thought this game would be good, but I was really disappointed. One of my friends was too, as on the Daikatana CD, he wrote ""In case of fire, throw CD in"". I think that about sums it up."
1,What a terrible mess,"""I am only left asking, ""how long until Daikaitaina 2? """" - Ha-Ha-Ha-Ha-Ha-Ha-Ha!I really tried to like this game.I felt like screaming ""Turn the lights on!"" during the first level. What a murky morass. I installed this game twice and I still can't stand it.What angers alot of gamers is this: We wonder what games didn't get made because ""Daikajokea"" sucked up so much cash?"
3,Outstanding...2 years ago...,"Excelent weapons, nice graphics (yeah! I like DK graphics), good sound but poor sidekicks and low ingame originality."
1,MAKING THIS GAME WAS A CRIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"THIS GAME SUCKS! THE GAMEPLAY IS HORRILBLE!!!!!!!!IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A HIT IN 1990!!!!!!! THE GRAPHICS ARE HORRIBLE, IN FACT THEY SHOULDN'T EVEN CALL THESE GRAPHICS!!!!!!!!!!!!! DON'T BUY EVER BUY THIS GAME UNLESS YOUR DESPERATE AND YOU NEED SOMETHING TO FEED THE FIRE WITH!"
1,PC Game? More like trash.,"1. You call this even half way descent graphics?2. Should have been ""lost forever.""3. Who cares about shooting 2' long mosquitoes and psychotic frogs?4. Stick with Unreal (the first one).Romero needs to go stand in the corner for this one."
4,A good way in the dark,"it's a good product that would be useful if in the dark and such. but, overall it's worth the price."
5,lessons come in all forms,"I spent all night reading this book, given to me by a friend who also read it in a single sitting. It is for me another example of the power of the spirit over all things, a reminder to trust in our hearts, and that the greatest lessons also come from struggle. May each of us be as inspired to approach our lives with as much courage, honesty, and love as this young man from behind the walls of death row."
5,Changes lives of my students every year,"Since I began using this book in my 11th grade American Literature/Contemporary Composition classes a few years ago, students have consistently remarked that it has changed the way they view life, the world, and themselves. They consistently say that it is the most meaningful literature we read all year. From Jarvis, they learn life lessons and how to go beyond self-pity and anger. Jarvis is a beautful man and I recomend this book heartily to anyone wishing to open their heart."
4,Inspirational Journey,"The most powerful benefit that this book had for me was it's ability to inspire me to live my life as it is and be honest about myself to others. There is a deep vulnerability in the writing that allows the reader to connect with the suffering in prison, and life in general for that matter. I am interested in prisons and buddhism, so this book fit the bill very well. This book was written well, just not outstanding. Worth while."
2,Interesting peek into San Quentin,"This book was an easy read, and gave me a good sense of what it was like for Masters to go from angry to peaceful in prison. It's not professionally written, but one wouldn't expect it to be. I think it would be interesting to people who study prison psychology, violence, Buddhism and meditation, and/or personal growth and transformation."
5,Practical Aromatherapy by Penny Rich,"A beautifully presented book that is easy to read and refer to. It contains specific recipes for different oils and their applications. I found it invaluable for household and personal use when I wanted to use a natural, non-harmful product around my family."
1,Wow! You're like completely useless! THANKS!,"Hey! This book is so useful being 112 dollars or whatever that i'll be sure to distro them while tabling at the next protest!In fact, we regularly make sure to pass around books that are a minimum of 100 dollars while on the barricades, it really is a central tactic. These authors actually started the Million Dollar Book Bloc.I wish 35 more academics could make their careers off other people's grassroots activism, and maybe next time they could charge 100 MORE dollars and then the REVOLUTION would HAPPEN, MAN!Thanks soooo much to the authors! We'd like, almost read this!"
1,Didn't work for me,"This did not work for me, although it got great reviews here. Ultimately what did work was apple cider vinegar. It took almost a year, but it finally got rid of them for good! (Google it.) Before that I had tried everything: duct tape, Dr. Scholl's, nitrogen freezing, candida injections, DPCP... for years. Finally the ACV really did the trick. Would definitely recommend that."
1,it doesn't work.,and I so wanted this to but nope. it goes on like vasoline; my dog didn't seem to mind the medication at all. I used the entire tube and measured my little boy's warts once every 3 days. He has the large broccoli appearing type. The medication didn't even make a dent.
2,Hasn't worked for me,I have used this for several months with no significant difference in the wart. Perhaps if you use it immediately it would work better.
5,Nice,"Buy this CD so you can say you knew them when. Once they sign, they are going to throw another curveball into the traditional hip hop scene with their incredible sound.If you have the opportunity to see them live, you must take it. I sincerely hope they will add some live cuts in their upcoming CD 5 elements.Nice, very nice."
4,how to separate the pieces,"1) open both the fork and spoon2) put your two hands on either side of the set3) pop it apart. (push the fork and spoon towards each other, sorta.)"
5,compact and perfect,"Heavy duty, compact. Perfect for camping, hiking, etc. It fit perfectly in my mess kit. Highly recommend this to anyone."
3,decent,I have tried many diffrent tools while camping and this product is just ok. My prefered tool is the recently purchased Columbia utensile set but that looks to be a limited production run for the holidays and lacks a can opener. I actually own two of these Coleman Untensil's and have used them on several trips.The knife and spoon are functional. The fork is too narrow and frustrating to use. The bottle opener and can opener are functional also. Knife and can opener needed some sharpening. Most of the time I use my Leatherman Super Tool to open bottles and cans simply because the product is far superior for accomplishing those tasks.If they widened the fork it would get an extra star.Like another reviewer also stated I would NOT put this in a dishwasher. Just hand clean it. It will last a lot longer.
5,My 7 year old daughter loves this series!,"My 7 yr old daughter loves this series. It has a positive message, she loves the animation & feels it is not so babyish. My husband & I enjoy the healthy girl image and family friendly values."
3,Informative and concise.,"This book is a complete study guide for the major structural topics and questions for the architectural licensing exam. My overall enthusiasm for this book was average. I found that there were chapters that were too vague or simply did not have enough information on specific equations. I also found that I did have to supplement the studying from this book with my own notes from my structures courses along with additional study material from other sources. I do recommend this book for anyone wishing to brush up on thier studying for the Lateral Forces and General Structures portions of the ARE/NCARB. Keep in mind, as with any other division of the exam, this would not be a single source for study material."
1,Do not buy from BeautyEncounter!,It is a tester!!! Be aware!!!Poor quality.The bottle looks old and I did not want to get a tester for my friend as birthday gift. They will not let me return it even with original packaging in 48 hours. Look close to their return policy. They are not professional. The tester did not have a lid. And it clearly stated on the outside of the bottle that it is not for sale. It did not smell good as well. Sticky ... not like a authentic product.I would advice you not to buy this product and any product from BeautyEncounter according to my experience.
3,Up & Coming,"Let me step in here and say, I got this record after hearing it played on the PA at a concert. I really like it and listen to it all the time. However, she DOES sound like Ani, and is more than just ""reminiscent"" of difranco, and that does diminish it's value. Basically you are treading in no new ground, but you will still enjoy it and not regret spending the $$ for it. I have it in my player and it hasn't left, so that should tell you something. ... .."
3,Alright,"Its funny how Doria thinks anything that doesn't agree is a ""prank of a review."" She's got a big chip on her shoulder.This album is decent...it has some excellent tracks on it, and some that you skip over in the CD player. I would recommend it, but I wouldn't sell my soul to get it."
1,Does anyone else smell garbage?,"The game play is weak, with all the explosions and lights going off its almost impossible to keep track of your character on the screen. I heard this game was comparable to Contra witch I loved. I was lied to. This game looks like something off of the original NES got a graphical makeover and nothing more. And the replay value is zip. Its the same bad guys in the same spots over and over, no artificial intelegence to speak of. Theres bad camera angles, bad transitions from screen to screen. It goes on and on and on."
1,This game is aptly titled!,"Expendable is the name of the game. So I played it once and threw it in the trash. I couldn't even give it away... Nobody wanted to suffer through the pile of garbage for the whole 20 minutes that I did. The graphics are very good and over the top(but WAY too small). The sound is pretty good too. Then you actually sit down to play this boring waste and it hits you... All you do is walk around killing the same three enemies and finding the key to the next door. Hey! It's Doom in a top down perspective! That's exactly what it is. Don't buy this one, even if it's the only game left to complete your collection of DC games. This ain't Pokemon, you don't have to catch them all. You definetly don't have to catch this one. Pass it on by.SegaCide"
2,Boring,"I think this game, Expendable, was a waste of time basically and had the same plot as I continued to play it. You walk around and kill aliends that are trying to take over all the planets that humans live in. I do like some of the weapons that are avalable throughout the game but I don't like the view it gives you. I think it's an overall hard game to play esspecially certain bosses but after awhile you just get tired of constant action and shooting and mindless killing. It doesn't any good movies in the game either."
1,This is not Contra for the DC!,"You are unable to jump in this game. So if you're caught in a cross fire, you will be shot. This happens very often. If you were able to jump, then the game would be a little easier to play.The graphics are weak, and the actions is very repetitive. After 3 days of playing I decided to return it for credit.As another reviewer said, enen if you're finishing your collection of the few remaining DC games, you should stay away from this one."
1,esrb misprint,"I had bought this game at a toysrus store in Fargo, ND. the game case said that it was rated t for animated violence. when I got home and opened it and started playing I was quite surprised.there was mass amount of blood in this game. later, I went on the internet and went to the toysrus site and researched the game and to find out that there was gore and realistic violence( to find out what this means go to http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/stores/static/-/videogames/v.../104-4448277-636154in conclusion, I would like to say that if you like body parts flyin' and lots o' blood, than this is a game for you, but for those of you that are queasy at the site of this content stay away from this game. I don't like games that are like that, so, that is why I gave this game but one star"
1,"Poorly written and organized, erased it.","Though marketed like a reference piece, this e-book lacks in historical reference and is more of a personal commentary from the author. I erased it."
1,I gave this one star because,"Amazon won't let me give it zero.The dialog may have been bad. I'm not sure because the audio quality was so bad I couldn't understand the dialog. The story has been told many times before and much better than this mess. there was the requisite fluttery caftan-wearing African Queen. Nothing against fluttery caftan-wearing queens, but they seem to show up in bad gay movies more for comic effect than for any contribution they make to the story.Bottom line: Skip this one."
1,An hour of my life I would like back!!!,"This movie, if you can even call it that, is beyond terrible.I only rented this but it was still a complete waste of Time and Money. The lighting, audio, camera work, acting and script are all terribly sub par.If this was made for a highschool film project it would have received a ""D"" and only that good if the teacher was in a really good mood!!At best this could have been cut down to a terribly average ""short"" and wouldnt have taken more than 10 min to watch.Move on and find something else... ANYTHING else!!!!"
1,it only got one star because you can't give it a negative,"about the only positive thing about this movie is the message it tries to put out there. It had bad acting, bad script, and below grade acting and sound.I will not watch this ever again and don't suggest it for anyone."
1,this movie sucked,And not in the good way. This is one of the movies I bought and will only watch once. I thought it was terrible.
1,I hate to pile it on but....,"there is no excuse for this movie to be in existence. I have to admit I only watched a small portion of it, it was that bad. The horrible acting and sound quality and stupid script complete with extremely annoying queen were unbearable after 20 minutes. I think the producers should be locked in a cell for 7 days and forced to watch this continuously in penance for foisting it upon the world. Too bad the 8th amendment prohibits ""cruel and unusual punishment"".Why oh why didn't I check Amazon reviews before buying it."
5,The more you listen...the more you love!,"Perhaps I'm biased, because I know Jim (he's awesome) and because my husband played a lot of the banjo tracks...but any album he creates is worth owning. The more you listen to it, the more you end up loving it and craving to hear it again...and again...and again... You get the point."
2,not good!,this is very old technology most of it does not apply today even if you do not know much about gold dredging you still will not know much after reading this poorly written raft of drivel!!!YOUR WELCOME
5,I listen to this all the time,"My wife and I have probably seen 1000 bands, but when we saw Mark at the tiny Hotel Utah in SF (myself having had to drag her uninterested self there) and he played ""Fathering,"" she started sobbing. If that ain't the full embodiment of the power and beauty of music, I don't know what is.Do yourself a favor and get this CD."
4,Simple-ness,"I really dig this album. I kind of expected some kind of band thing when I found this, but was happily surprised at the simplicity and directness of his songwriting, singing, and seemingly simple guitar. This is a nice record for those who have dicovered Elliot Smith or still pine for the greatness of Miracle Legion. The photgraph on the cd cover is about as accurate as you can get."
1,Not good,"I had to push very hard w/ the joystick to get it to respond. Maybe mine was just defective. I got a refund and am not planning on getting another one. For the best arcade stick, get the x-arcade stick at their website."
2,"Looks nice, that's it.","I bought this, after already owning the Street Fighter Aniversary Arcade stick for almost a year, and when I first held it, it felt really flimsy. The stick is too short and you have to jam it into each angle hard, making you lose a lot of timing, and in fighting games, timing is everything. The stick is angled akwardly and the buttons are terrible. You'd have more fun popping the bubble wrap that came in the packaging. It looks nice, and is priced really cheap. But you get what you pay for. I thought It'd be nice to have 2 matching arcade sticks for when friends come over to play, so I bought 2. Boy was that a mistake. Now I have to hide them when they come over. Why couldn't SNK work a deal with Hori to produce a stick for the US?"
1,It was not the right stuff,I returned this for a full refund because it appeared to be the wrong product inside and appeared to be in a used bottle.
2,Not the same.,The shampoo does not look the same nor smell the same as the last purchase of it that I made. The prior product was clear this is yellow. Either they changed the product or this is not it.
1,Smells like Mennen Speed Stick,"Works like any cheap shampoo should, but smells terrible. If you don't mind your hair smelling like Old Spice or Right Guard, have a blast.Some reviewers say this stuff is not the real Crew Daily Shampoo. I would not doubt it, but I have prior experience with the legit product."
1,Waste of Money,I don't know what shampoo is in this bottle but it's NOT American Crew! Save your money. The bottle is American Crew but the shampoo is some cheap stuff from the dollar store.
1,I'm not sure this is an original shampoo.,"The shampoo was in a recycled bottle with an attached home-made bar code, which is not recognizable by a bar-code reader."
2,Dont buy it,"I have the same problem with another customer:a recycled bottle with an attached home-made bar code. Although it was sold by another seller.It smells disgusting. After washing the bottle, the bar code fall out. After washing my head, my hair fall out. I am scaring and throw it away. Good thing is I get the refund from Amazon."
1,FAKE,"Like others said, the CAP is wrong, not the type American Crew uses, the BOTTLE is old/used, and most importantly stuff inside is not real American Crew shampoo. I use American Crew all the time, and I know how it smells and feels. THIS IS FAKE."
1,COMPLETELY FAKE... NOT REAL... FRAUD,"The shampoo that I received is not really American Crew. It smells completely different from what it should smell like and clearly is not the real deal. I'd return it, but the shipping would probably cost more than I spent to buy it. Don't buy from this seller."
5,Great Ideas,"I found many great ideas in reading this book. The author devotes a good portion of this book to making your own backgrounds and sets. That was very helpful and will save me thousands of dollars, not to mention have my studio look different than my competitors.There were many creative pictures throughout this book that will provide any photographer with great posing ideas. This book is far better than most of the posing books that I have read."
5,Great Book On Senior Photography,This is the best book that I have read on senior photography since Larry Peter's last book (Larry it is time to write another book).The photographs are fresh and interesting and I got a lot of great posing ideas. All of Mr. Rice's books are easy to read and easy to understand.This book really should have been called Marketing Senior Photography because that is what most of it is all about. His ideas on Ambassador programs will be able to be helpful to my business immediately. Thanks for sharing such great ideas with photographers evrywhere!
3,Beginner or Amatuer Level Guide,"Though the book contains several great photos, it is written for someone very new to digital cameras and contains thorough explanations of how digital technology works. I don't recommend this for anyone with any basic knowledge of how to use your digital camera. Though I do recommend it if you are new to digital photography. It also suffers from another tech side effect. The book was written well before current technology existed and has somewhat dated information."
2,Disappointing,I found this book through some forum posts on the topic. I had high expectations on the book but found it lacking content I can really sink my teeth into. None of the ideas were revolutionary for a book published in 2010. I was also disappointed that fair bit of the book was used to cover basic camera operation when the author should have used the space to discuss topics that pertain to the subject at hand.
1,What a joke.,"this book is 80% about marketing and sales(which is no good), and only 10% about shooting techniques(which are no good). the other 10% is just useless book filler info. i am a pro photographer and would not recommend this to my worst enemy."
2,Not alot of substance,"This book is like many of the photo books I've read lately, not much substance. It's got a nice flashy cover, but there really isn't much useful info inside. It seems like thats the trend I'm seeing in many of the new photography books that are being pushed. They put some flashy pictures in them here and there, many of them are not even the authors pictures, and write some fluff and make some money."
5,Learn how to capture unique portraits of either teens and seniors,"Learn how to capture unique portraits of either teens and seniors, how to marketing images to them, and how to maximize the features of both teens and seniors through Digital Portrait Photography Of Teens And Seniors which covers everything from personalizing the photo shoot for the client to making the most of promoting this specialized path in portrait photography. From shooting in studio or outdoor locations to accepting input from clients and posing teens and seniors, Rice's many solid tips are based on his own experience."
1,Still waiting ...3 weeks,"Similar to the other reviewer, it is three weeks and I have still not recieved this item."
3,NFL Gameday 2000,It had great graphics and I loved how the players made tackles but they did overdue some stuff
2,Very confusing and frustrating...,Don't waste your money! I was really disappointed with this game. It was very confusing to figure out. I was constantly getting my butt kicked. Madden 2000 is a better and easier to understand game and you can actually win a few!
2,predictable,"I bought this game and Madden 2000. I thought this game was better at first but Madden still is the king when it comes to pure football simulation. Same playbook make it easy to pick-up to play, but get repetitious. Also the celebrations are a little ridiculous. Only thing I like better over Madden is the commentary is personalize like ""Terrell Davis busts one off for a huge gain"", rather than in Madden Summerall would say ""he just went over 100 yards"". Call me crazy but those little details make the game seem more realistic. Final rating Madden 4.5 Gameday 2"
2,die hard gamer,"this installment of gameday is the exact same game as last year...madden 2000 blows this game away....gameday is not a simulation its an arcade game. every player is the same, just different jerseys... it doesnt matter if youre the browns or the Jags you can go 16-0 and lead the league in every stat."
3,Turn off your brain.,"This is a pretty fun game. The graphics are above average, and the animation is fairly smooth. As mentioned by other reviewers, there are one or two niggling little bugs, but for me they didn't really detract from my enjoyment (as the title states, turn off your brain).The commentators become a little same-ish after a while (""Here is a good example of the quarterback waiting, waiting, waiting, and then..."" you get the idea).I like some of the other features, like designing your ideal ""super"" player, being able to trade folks out of the team, free agents etc etc.If you just want mindless entertainment, you should enjoy this, if you're looking for a real simulation of football management, or first person football, then this probably isn't for you.I wonder when SimFootball comes out? :-)"
1,Even one star is too much,"Purchased in Jan. 12. 2012 and started using from Jan. 15. 2012. Today is this bulb's funeral. Not even a month of life -- described average 2,000 hours - wow -"
3,Less than cliched,"Hu Die is an interesting look at the lesbian film genre from an Eastern perspective. I enjoyed the fact that it lacked common cliches found in western films like the lovers being doomed or the husband being violent. The films real stars are Joman Chiang,Flavia's first lover, and Isabel Chan as Flavia's younger self. They seemed more comfortable as lovers than Josie Ho with Tian Yuan in the present. a special kudos goes to Eric Kot for playing the abandoned husband who is for all intents and purposes a decent man watching the woman he loves leave him for a younger woman. In the west he could easily been excused for violence for such humiliation but he takes his character to higher ground and in the end I feel he was more compelling than the lead.He may be the loser but he was always the good guy."
5,Excellent Introductory Text,"Patricia Aalseth sets example for how to present complex material in a simple, concise, and understandable way. If you need to learn major definitions and abbreviations of coding and billing, e.g., ICD-9, CPT, LMRP, CCI, HCFA, modifiers, and other issues quickly, Codebusters helps you the fastest.Yuval Lirov, Practicing Profitability - Billing Network Effect for Revenue Cycle Control in Healthcare Clinics and Chiropractic Offices: Collections, Audit Risk, SOAP Notes, Scheduling, Care Plans, and Coding"
2,Quality sub par !,"This was a gift for my wife. She was dissapointed with the product. She has been using for years, always purchasing from our local Macy's store. She advised me that the quality was sub par when compared toher existing bottle. I'm sure I will never make this mistake again when it come to a perfume purchase."
2,Seen it...,"Some games are fun without being even remotely challenging. Gulf War is such a game. You are in control of the M12 Hammer, a super-duper Army tank sent in to win another Persian Gulf War against Saddam Hussein. Helping you get it done is the OASIS (Operational Armor Stabilization and Integration System), a sort of self-repair mechanism that allows you to replenish your armor by driving your tank into deep bodies of water (don't ask). The game plays a lot like Recoil, with the mouse controlling the free-look turret as you zip over 3D terrain and waste hordes of enemy vehicles. Again, there's nothing here you haven't seen before, but it's good clean fun for action fans."
3,Game overall performance,a. Graphics need to be improved b. When all levels are won you need to be able to go online and get an update. c. The game runs very slow d. Once you have went to the end its not as fun e. Please set up a random selection game that take pcs of several games and puts them together at random in one game. f. Make it possible to play the game all the way through without stopping These are improvements. Thanks Terry Elkins

5,These Seasonings are really good!,"I have been using these Chef Paul Prudhomme's seasonings for some years now. I haven't tried every seasoning they have available. But I have used the poultry, shrimp, meat and several others. My absolute favorite is the Pizza & Pasta Magic. This is one we don't want to be without! We put it on pizza and I use it in many other dishes as well. With these seasonings you can discover new recipes. They really make good meals. It's fun to experiment with them."
1,unreadable,"I am an avid reader & can wrap my mind around just about any genre or author (except epic saga romances) but this book was unreadable to me it was maybe interesting in the 60's when it was first released (although to whom I can't imagine) but i just couldn't stomach this book It is just plain silly, frustrating & boring and I am sorry I wasted $ on ordering it hopefully anyone considering this book won't make the same mistake I did, thinking you're getting a quaint, rediscovered gem because, like me you'll regret it."
1,"be warned, evangelical book disguised as werewolf book.","be warned, evangelical book disguised as werewolf book."
4,Esoteric,Good book from the theorists perspective but not a book that will help you learn and apply in practical situations.Mr. Saaty appears to be gifted in this area and his development of the topics is clear and concise.Initially gave three stars but changed to four since I am rating the book on content only (using other books for practice).
4,"Wacky, random asian humor","Although this might seem a tad strange, and it is, this urban Korean fantasy is a hilarious tale of rebellion at it's best. It takes boredom to the next level with a common tale about four misunderstood young people with nothing better to do than lash out at society by causing trouble. Watching the trials and tribulations of these four people makes for a highly entertaining film and the wacky humor that ensues is nothing short of insanity. Bullies, delivery boys, gangsters, this film has everything. The humor is pretty random, so it's not for everyone, but those who want a bit of nonsensical fun, should fine this film amusing. It's filled with pleasant surprises and is also surprsingly enduring with a reason for the rhyme, which helps make it more digestible. Anyone looking for a good time, check this film out, it's all kinds of fun."
2,NOT worth the BIG bucks,"This movie was kinda funny, but what killed it for me was the excessive use of profanity in the English subtitles: Too much dropping of the F-Bomb. Reportedly, the original Korean dialog WASN'T this bad.I resent filmmakers thinking a film has to be potty-mouthed to be enjoyed by Americans. (That goes for Hollywood, too.)"
5,Original Fun and Cool,"Though it may not be the greatest film made it sure was a fun ride, i enjoyed this movie a lot. The plot simple, 4 guys decide to rob a gaz station one night, when they go back the second time,No Money , and they get put in some very weird situations, and a series of unfournate evnts leading it to be very funny and neat in it's own way. If you enjoyed Snatch, Pulp Ficiton and other crime drama/comedy, your either going to love or hate Attack of the Gaz Station but it was wildly enternating and very fun all in all."
5,Oh How I Love This Movie!,"Hilarious, sweet, touching movie about misfits and anarchy. Great acting. What's not to love? The music is so cool, I wish there was a soundtrack. Is there? And you can learn how to swear in Korean! (ah-shhhhh...)I am happy to see that this film is getting a well-deserved cult following. Watch it now!"
5,great!,"I'm glad I was able to find this book on Amazon. I was able to spend a lot less compared to buying it used at the bookstore, and it's in the condition described."
3,"A easy and quick read, but not especially stunning....","Not a bad book overall, but I found it a bit too ""cutsey"" that new gal in town (Meg) would form such a quick and intense bond of friendship with neighbor, Christine. Next thing you know, she's coaching the baseball team, too. It was just a bit too unbelievable to me. I did like the cozy description of the house and the land - details that appeal to me. The mystery itself was good - I found myself reading to the end non-stop to find out who-done-it. It was a good book, but not one to put on my top ten list."
3,"more historical interest than ""how to""","This book assumes an advanced level of understanding and technical ability. The instructions are terse and the diagrams are small and unclear. References to ""buckram"" and ""crinoline"" backing fabric imply a ""millinery supply"" store.However, the illustrations are inspirational for an expierienced crafter."
3,Old Fashioned Ribbon Art: Ideas and Designs for Accessories and Decorations,"Actually, this was a fun little booklet. I am sure it was published in the 20s or 30s and not changed at all. Interesting to see references such as ""smart look"" in print. ""Smart"" is a word I have used as a Canadian and I see now it is just an old word for ""fashionable"". Instructions pretty clear for making various decorations."
5,Excellent metal,"All the songs on this cd are very good, if you like the speedier stuff from Primal Fear than you'll love this cd..One of the best. I don't want to get into a long drawn out review, here are my fav picks:Magic Eye, FEAR, Black Sun, Mind Machine & Armageddeon!"
3,Good retro movie,Easy to watch and remember when movies did not all have explosions and gunsfire in them. This one is a cult classic and deserves a place marking several actors getting their start in the business.
3,Decent recording,"This album by Christophe Rousset is one of the better offerings featuring Scarlatti on the harpsichord. I personally enjoy Scarlatti's sonatas more when they are played on the piano, since they tend to have a warmer tone, but this is a decent disc that has none of the harsh, metallic harpsichord sounds that sometimes mar recordings made on the instrument. The only strange thing about the recording is the cover photo of Mr. Rousset. With his baggy ""homeboy""-style pants and sloppy dress, I think he might harbor secret ambitions of being the star of a rap album instead of a classical one. Minus one star for the lame fashion choice. For Scarlatti on the piano, check out Ivo Pogorelich on Deutsche Gramophon, Mikhail Pletnev on Virgin, Andras Schiff on Hungaraton, or anything by Vladimir Horowitz."
1,My Mistake!,"I should have read all the reviews. The ""product page"" mentions 'English subtitles' but doesn't disclose that the whole libretto has been translated and is sung in English. One reviewer makes mention of that crime, but I didn't read his review, which is altogether too generous anyway. Singing this work in English is a catastrophe. The rhythms of the music and the accents of the words don't watch at all; it's comparable to watching a Clint Eastwood film dubbed in Chinese. In fact, the music has a lot of folksy charm, and the opera would be a frolicsome delight if sung with enthusiasm and matched with lusty dance choreography. But the singing is dumpling-stodgy, particularly the chorus, and the dramatic movement is hardly worthy of a high school pageant. This production was filmed live at the Wexford Festival in 1988 and merely repackaged recently to look glossier than it is. It's a dud. Skip it."
3,"On the ""Action Approach"" theme","This book continues the theme of ""The Action Approach,"" which I remember more clearly, so see my review of that book!"
4,Metropolitan Opera Centennial Gala,The music is beautiful although I expected more familiar areas. The main thing I would complain about is the lack of identifying each singer. Only the name of the area is shown.
2,A mishandled jewel,"I now own this DVD as well as the VHS original, the only improvement is visual, I find the recording very very poor. I would venture to say that with proper adjustments I can get better sound and volume from the VHS. Should you buy the DVD ? Yes ! Yet don't expect much, and try to enjoy it as a photo/video album of dying stars."
5,Perfect!,This product totally rocks! It was easy to install and now my weed eater works! I highly recommend this if you happen to be a klutz like me and lose things when you do a tear down.
1,"Totally awful! Boring adaptation; Amateurish playing, acting & singing","After the very scrappy performance of the effervescent overture, it takes nearly 30 minutes of seemingly interminable ""acting"" until the first ""singer"" gets to sing. Be advised that the acting & singing are as amateurish as the playing by the orchestra. This DVD on the usually reliable Kultur label should never have been released. Embarrassingly bad."
1,OUCH,"After the mediocre playing of the should-be-wonderful overture, there is a long, long, long section of dialogue, then just when you think it couldn't be worse, the the singing begins.Is the singing is awful on purpose--to be funny maybe? Maybe the singers are genuinely awful.Who can tell, since they never sing any other way.This opera? performance is so bad it hurts."
4,These things are great!,"These things are great! We have a four year old boy who persists in running his hand along the hallway wall as he walks. Marks are gone now! It has also removed crayon, pencil and general scuff marks. They do disintegrate fast, so when we bought more, we bought the ""extra strength"" ones for about a dollar more per box because they're supposed to last longer. Don't waste your money on that. They disintegrate just as fast. The only difference I could see is that the top was kind of wavy and textured. Didn't make the sponge last longer. And, by the way, today I bought a very low end brand for 0.87 for two sponges and they work just as well. Doubt I'll buy the Mr. Clean brand anymore as long as a cheaper one is available (and that's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5)."
2,Mr. Clean Magic Eraser Cleaning Pads,"Cleans well on windows and glasses and some things that just need a little very light scrubbing. It does not do well on older bathroom and kitchen fixtures. It disintegrates too quickly making it an expensive product for what it does. It has it's place, but I probably will not buy it again."
5,"Amazing, just amazing.","I am a get some rubber gloves and Comet kind of girl so I am relectant to try anything new but oh my, the Mr. Clean Magic Eraser is just the step up in cleaner that absolutely removes the hard grime build-up. If you have water with minerals in it then the Magic Eraser is the perfect product to get rid of the build-up. Think of the build-up you can feel with your rag....this is the sort of grime that the Eraser goes right through. I don't care how fast I go through one to get through the gunk, I will buy these every time. Thank you Mr. Clean!"
2,Chinese Wagon,First wagon came to me with a busted box and had parts missing.I was sent a second box and it was ok but it still had nut bolts and washers missing and I just went to home depot and bought what I needed. So far the wagon seems ok after I got it together which was not hard to do.
1,Don't,"Want to be as dumb as me? Then buy this wagon in spite of all the bad reviews:- Flimsy metal? Right.- Bad welds painted over? 4.- Tires won't stay inflated? 2.- Unbelievably lousy packaging with loose parts? Check.- Inscrutable instructions? Yep.A nice additional feature on my wagon is that the front wheels wouldn't fit on the axles. Had to bang them on with a sledge. Did this damage the bearings? You bet!If you buy this, you deserve what you get.Negative stars."
2,damaged parts,"We ordered two of these carts. For both of them, the directions are very poor. Some of the parts were damagsd. We had to make our own parts and bend one part back into shape. The finished cart is sturdy so I gave it 2 stars."
4,Garden Wagon,The wagon arrived on time and shipping was free. The box it was shipped in was busted open and some of the nuts and bolts had spilled out on the porch when it was delivered. It took about an hour and a half to put it together. One of the spacers for the handle that keeps the wagon tongue straight is missing. Otherwise it does what the ad says. I like the wagon and great for carrying gardening items. Just be prepared to be patient putting it together.
1,Made in China,"When I opened the box to put the wagon together the screws and nuts were all over the box. As I put it together I discovered that two pieces were broken. The welded points were very poorly done and they just painted over them. I contacted the company for replacement parts, but they said they couldn't help me since I bought it from Amazon. So I had to pack it up (which was fun) and send it back for a refund."
5,5 Star Garden Wagon - 1 Star Assembly,"this is a great wagon to have to haul garden stuff from the car to the yard. I give it 5 stars, except for the assembly- there were no instructions, just a bag of nuts and bolts. I am not sure if they all come this way or just mine. Had to call manufacturer to get a worthless one page diagram- that is all they had.After I got it together, I have been very happy with it. It works great and handles well. Exactly what I needed."
4,Can't beat it for the price,The assembly instructions leave a lot to be desired but if you have any mechanical aptitude you can work your way through them. This is not a precision wagon but it is sturdy and rolls nicely. I just need it to move heavy planters around the yard. Even though the shipping brought the total cost to around $60 it is still an excellent value.
2,Got it today and..........,"I just got this item and opened it up, finding there was only one nylon strap on the box at one end and just tape on the other. Once I got the box open and pulled out the tires, bars, flat bed I found all the assembly hardware was hanging out loosley with out being in a bag to keep them from falling out of the box. Once I got all those pieces out and put them in a plastic bag I started looking at what I had and I am missing most of the pieces. So now I cant even put the thing together. Very maddening and upsetting. I would think that an item of this price would not be shipped in a box that isnt put together securely and that the small pieces would be in a secure bag. I am hoping that I will get a repacement on the pieces."
3,"Good Garden Wagon for home""","Good product, the HDC 350 lb. Load Capacity Flatbed Garden Wagon. But one bad thing tires go flat and will not seal back to rim."
3,You can buy it at a dollar store,Ummm. They work great but you can buy the same thing at a dollar store.
4,"Good, but limited","These are nice potholders for protecting your countertop, but not as effective at protecting your hands. Without double-layering the pad, the heat gradually gets through to your hand (e.g., when pulling a sheet pan out of the oven and holding it to check doneness of your food). You get about 15-20 seconds before it gets uncomfortable.On the ""pro"" side, they are easy to clean, provide a non-slip surface and take up very little room when storing."
4,Wonderful potholders,"I love these potholders. I was a little nervous ordering them because of the bad reviews some people had given. I think they are plenty flexible, I can grab a handle on a pan or a baking dish. Being able to wash them is a great plus. I can see how you could burn yourself through the hole, but once you figure out how to hold them they work great."
2,not all that,I really thought these would be nice to have but turns out they weren't. They sit in my drawer and are never used. They are difficult to use because they flop into the food. I'll just stick to cloth.
5,Extremely versatile *I Love This*,"I purchased 2 sets of these MIU Silicone Potholders in Black (4 total). I purchased them mainly to use as trivets, but oh my! I love them as potholders, trivets and jar openers. I will never own any other trivet or potholder ever again. Quick wash, almost no storage space, multipurpose! I highly recommend."
3,Potholders/Hot Matts,"These work terrific as hot matts, but not very well as potholders. They are not very flexible which makes them difficult to use as a potholder."

4,Fascinating journey into one man's mind.,"Arthur called his diary, ""... pure crap... out of the rectum of a rotting shadow and of no possible interest to anyone save a psychologist concentrating upon the disintegration of a person."" Although he was a somewhat nasty, prejudiced man, I think his diary was fascinating. I especially enjoyed his descriptions of his relationships with his female employees and the narratives of their lives. This is a book for specialized tastes--not for everyone"
4,551 pages of egomaniacal detail -- can you take it?,"I hope someone else out there has actually read this book -- its worth it, in many ways.While hidden away in his room during the whole of his lifetime with a medical condition no doctors could ever diagnose, the author kept a painstaking diary of his everyday ""experiences"". He paid for people to come sit with him and tell stories of their lives -- appealing, tragic, often sordid. He usually entered into intimate relationships with these people, all the while dissecting them within the thousands of pages of his diary. Arthur blackmailed his millionaire parents to subsidize him, viciously tormented his servants and wife and eventually committed suicide. But not before he left for posthumous publication his eerie, hateful, yet fascinating world view."
3,Not a rosy picture this book paints!,"This book is one of the bleakest books I have read. The diarist has developed a notion that his eyes are delicate(among other psychosomatic diseases) so he lies in a darkened room most of the day. He has cut himself off from society, the only people with whom he associates are his paid staff: Doctors, talkers, helpers and wife. The talkers read and talk about themselves to Arthur who eventually beds them, grows emotionally dependent on them and lavishes them with presents to keep them. Even with his wife it's this way. Arthurs ambition is to chronicle every thought and not censor himself, and while he is mentally ill and thus deludes himself on a number of issues, he does succeed in being brutally honest especially on the members who has left his fold. I challenge anyone to find any positive human values in this book, it certainly does show the dark side of human nature."
3,It never ends with him...,"I discovered this book after reading Colin Wilson's THE BOOKS IN MY LIFE. Interesting look into the life of a spoiled racist - I define a racist as someone who believes other races to be inherently inferior to his own - predjudice being something completely different.Curious that this man could make all these assessments about races and events in the world from his bedroom, never truly experiencing anything, other than hemmoroids. However, a fascinating, candid read that suprisingly, 500 pages into it still kept my interest. This is afer reading Rousseau's CONFESSIONS in the same year! Need a rest -Proust will have to wait!If you enjoy brutally honest, 1st person narrative that expounds on thoughts, I recommend this book. Since I, unlike many others, find the inane bigotry amusing, and am desenitized to the stupidity, I will refrain from warning against such and take the liberty of assuming the reader is mature enough to not to allow oneself to be offended."
3,Perfect game for young kids,"This is the perfect game for young kids. great graphics, neat characters, cool music. However, for older gamers this game is too easy and too short. If you have kids buy Pen-Pen and play it with them."
3,"Difficult, you must already program in C++ to benefit","I bought this believing that it would be the equivalent of ""The C Programming Language"" by Kernighan & Ritchie-- clear, consise, and accurate.I can't fault it for accuracy, but the writing is very dense, and organized in such a way that someone without previous knowledge of the C++ would not be able to learn much from it.After reading ""Thinking in C++"" by Bruce Eckel and ""Learn C++ in 21 Days"" by Jessie Liberty, I was able to understand Stroustrup's book, sort of.I think this is a nice book to have, but I'm not sure it cannot be replaced by others which are more accessible."
3,If you write C++ you need it.,"Unfortunately it's not either a good learning text or a good reference text. This book pales to its predicessor ""The Annotated C++"" which was a good reference book. It does try to be everything for everyone and as usual with this, isn't. You really need IOStreams by Langer &Kreft, for a full discussion on streams and Locales, Exceptional C++ by Sutter for exceptions, The Standard Library by Josuttis, and Accellerated C++ by Koening and Moo to learn it. But there are some questions and examples which are not covered at all in those other books and for that you need a copy of this one by your desk."
3,The Best and the Worst C++ Book,"This book needs two ratings, one for C++ experts (a 10) and one for beginners (1). If you are starting with C++, get another book. If you know C++, this IS the reference. I find that the book has everything, but it is not organized for beginners. The examples are mostely code snippets and are not complete. The index is poor and not extensive enough."
3,The definitive C++ book. . . but it has a terrible index!,"I agree with everyone who says that this is the definitive guide to C++ and would like to agree that all C++ programmers should have it. But like its predecessor, it has a very serious drawback that limits its usefulness as a reference book: the index is *terrible*. Stroustrup seems to have decided to sacrifice completeness for conciseness in the index. At least the second edition had the reference manual in the back."
5,"One of the GREATEST Reference, but NOT a Tutorial.","From my years of C++, this is definitely the one of the best reference books available. This book cover all the aspects of C++, one of the most complicated programming language, with a nice detail of everything, including STL.However, this book is NOT a language/programming tutorial. To read this book, you might need tons of C++ & OOP knowledges, even if you are an ace C programmer. If you are a novice, please read any ""good"" primer book before coming to this one, or you will get lost easily.If you are a C++ programmer, you can't get anything better than this! This is a MUST, and should be on all C++ programmers' shelf!"
2,Comprehensive but badly written,"The fact that Stroustrup's C++ is arguably the most comprehensive C++ book out there, does not hide the fact that it is one of the most longwinded, opinionated, and overrated academic books ever written. I like C++, have been using it for years, and have referred to Stroustrup a lot. Usually I find what I am looking for, but at the expense of having to go through a lot of cross-references and self-important speeches (""I did this and I thought of that"").Compare this with K&R C, where you'll find what you're looking for in little or no time, and which probably never uses the pronoun ""I"" (or even ""We"" unless including the reader). Brevity and humility are underrated and underappreciated.In my opinion, Stroustrup would have been 4-5 times better if it was 4-5 times shorter, and it would have lost none of its comprehensiveness in the bargain."
5,Its esoteric,"I believe its a great book, but not for beginners. Great concepts, of course from the designer of C++."
4,"Very good on C++, but not a good reference for STL","As many readers noted before me, this book is not for beginners. However, for programmers who have experience in OO programming and C, this is a great book.The only thing I miss is a complete and well-organised reference of the standard C++ library. Many aspects of the library are explained and illustrated with clear examples, but there is no clear and complete list of what the library contains - Stroustrup simply says ""look at the header files to find out more""..."
1,Not well-writen,Not well-written. Inventor of a language is not necessarily a good writer to make a book about it. I stay away from this book.
4,Poorly written and not well organized but good text..,"I think that the author rushed in creating this book because it was poorly written. The code examples in the book are not well put togeter they are scattered throughout the place. I highly do no recomend this book to a beg in c++ programming. The book is also good for refrence, But I have to rate this book as a 4 because the author acomplished his job by explaining to you what and how to implement the langauge into your program. I would given this book a 5 but it was poorly written. Oh well we hope that the new edition if the author creates one will be better ."
5,"An encyclopedic, but terse, description of the language","I am a newcomer to the C++ language, and this was not the first book I read, but it is essential. As I work through the language I return to it again and again. Many books explain how to do something in C++, but there are times when you want a general statement of what is permissable, or what something means, and that is when you find this book indispensible. It is not intended as a primer, however, so it should not be criticized for not being one. It is simply a complete description of the language, and very well written, to boot."
3,WARNING!! Not for student use!,"Used in a college level course, only to wish I hadn't... Uses far too complex examples throughout book."
3,serial book,"My impression from spending months with this book, using it as a guide for more obscure language features that I don't personally use (but others, whose code I support, do), is that it is a serial read. Many of the examples are built upon earlier chapters, and while it usually doesn't matter, I find myself going back again and again to try to figure things out (I don't have time to read it cover-to-cover). Luckily I kept my 2nd edition Stroustrup handy, and I use that instead fairly often. The index initially appears sparse and next-to-useless, but if it's not in the index, it's in the table of contents. I bought the first printing, which was my mistake; luckily the errata sheet is online. And to top it all off, the cover is really floppy, making it hard to hold anywhere but on a desk. But it looks good on my bookshelf."
3,A good reference but not a good educator,This book is an invaluable reference for daily C++ programmers. This book is a terrible waste of money for novices looking to learn about C++. This explains why the rankings are all either 10s or 1s. I'm somewhere in between so I'll give it a 5.
2,Non usable book except for professional C++ grogrammer,This book is not organized for ease of quick look up. Definitely a disaster for a beginner in C++ even with C and Java background.
1,I Hate to Have to Use It,"Compared to the ""Annotated C++ Standard"", this book is a disaster for the working programmer. But Annotated is out of date - also a disaster. So its this or the $175 Ansi standard document if you need the facts. Please, please, finish the promised:The Annotated C++ Language Standard (coauthored by Andrew Koenig, the ANSI C++ committee's Project Editor)."
2,Terrible writing style,"Yes, all college kids praise this book as if this is the only book with detailed c++ info. First of all, this book contains plenty of information on C++. The contents of the book is very good. However, it is poorly organized and hard to understand because Bjarne's writing style is very very ""passive"" like the previous reviewer pointed out. Unfortunately, if you are serious about C++ programming, you have no choice but to read this and try to absorb as much as you can. No matter what level you are at, this is definitely not an easy read simply because its terribly written. So, don't feel stupid if you get stuck reading this book =)The 3rd edition has added more new features of C++ compared to the 2nd edition but the writing style is still the same. Hopefully, Dr. Stroustrup will realize this and change his writing style abit. All in all, a pretty bad book, but you should read it anyway."
5,Perfect book !!!,"This is a must-have book for any C++ users who want improve their knowledge in programming. The book gives me a very very comprehensive look inside C++, and it can also be called ""the art of C++ programming"". Last thing, it's too cheap in comparison to its value."
5,Tough read but a must,"True, as all the others say, not a book for beginners or even C experts (I thought I was one ;-P ) But if you earnestly want to learn C++ programming, this book can be used as a reference of how far still you have to go. The 3rd edition seems to be better, well-organised and more up-to-date than the other two. His style has also become a bit more lucid, but not by much. One thing you can say for this book, you'll never tire of it. Every time you read it, you'll discover some new aspect or usage of a C++ feature. Another must-have book for C++ is the ARM (if you don't know what I'm referring to, you don't need it yet!)."
2,Useless,"Useless for learning or reference. The way he writes it, it's almost as if he assumes you already know C++, and tries to lecture you on the finer points of the language instead. On the other hand, his rambling style and lack of thoroughness make it unsuitable for use as a reference book."
4,C++ from the creator,"This Review is on the 3rd Edition of the book. First let me mention that if you do not like learning by referring back and forth on various topics, then stick with elementary C++ programming books. For a beginner, I would not suggest this book. However, it is a very essential book to refer and ""study"" deep on various the topics that are representative of C++'s strengths. Referring C++ Templates and C++ Standard Library, both by Josuttis along with Dr.Stroustrup's book is the best way to quickly get to speed on the language.So the question is, why four stars? There is always room for improvement./Sarcasm/-If you do not like a book that demands some serious level of dedication, then don't worry about Dr.Stroustrup's book. You may be better off ""completely"" learning C++ with the book ""The (In)Complete Reference C++"" by Herb Schildt.-/Sarcasm/"
4,"A wonderful book, but one that contains some pitfalls.","This is destined to be a classic text. Modeled on the already-classic ""The C Programming Language"", it is at least as clear and better-organized. Be warned, though, that some of the features covered in this book are not actually implemented in current C++ compilers. This book covers what C++ _should_ be, and _will_ be in a few years. But not quite what it is _today_"
5,If you really want to understand C++,"Read this book if you really want to understand C++ - how to design and write code and why the language has the features that it does. Also, the description of the standard library is a must for any serious programmer."
2,Long tunnel to illumination,"I give the book 2 stars, one of which due to the witty quotes at the beginning of each chapter. If you want to make yourself a competitive professional C++ programmer, and are willing to spend an excessively long time in studying this bible, I would say this might be the book for you. But for someone like myself who only want to learn the language to program for my own jobs, and want to learn the language in a minimal amount of time, this book is a nightmare. Admittedly it's an informative book, but to shadow its plethora of information, it is organized in the most disorderly way. Stroustrup obviously likes talking. The book is like a Russian novel, or some work by Thomas Hardy, too verbose! What we want to learn is C++, not English! And we want to learn it the quickest way. I guess I will keep the book for reference. Yet definitely I will not start learning C++ with it. Had Stroustrup marked on the book's cover ""BEGINNERS STAY AWAY!"", it could've been a great book."
2,Unclear presentation of concepts and code,"It lacks a clear presentation of the concepts behind the various language constructs. Often it explains indirectly, by supplying tons of (complicated) examples and personal opinions. Indeed, this is not a beginners book: You first need to understand C++ before understanding what should have been ""The C++ Book""!Also, it does not contain a complete reference of STL, nor does it fully cover STL topics in the examples.The worst thing however, is the fact that all code is printed in a proportional font; which is especially bad for a language which uses a lot of punctuation. In this sense it's really unique (of all books I have seen about C, Java, Haskell, Lisp, Design Patterns, ..., it's the only one doing this). In addition, examples are sometimes badly formatted (probably to save space) making things even worse.But okay, if you already know C++ from better books ..., it does contain a lot of details not easily found together in another book."
2,Not a great text or reference,"I expected to enjoy or at least reference this book a lot, as it allegedly follows the style of the excellent ""The C programming language"". In practice I rarely use this book (despite owning both edition 1 and 3). There are many good alternative books, and I recommend that you look at those instead."
3,C++ programming,"The book is good, The only defect, it is almost completely theoric. Contains too few examples of the real programming. Is just an overview of concepts and abstractions about the C++ programming."
